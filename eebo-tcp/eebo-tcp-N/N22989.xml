            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>WHAT conſtitutes the happineſs or unhappineſs of our life? It is our character. It is the light in which we view things; in which we feel them, in which they affect us. Abundance of poſſeſſion does not ſuffice to make a man happy—he himſelf muſt be ſenſible of his happineſs—he muſt compare his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to that of others. Education unfolds the character—the paſſions eſtabliſh it: It is they that give it that energy, that violence which is augmented by the fire of youth, but tempered with difficulty in riper years.</p>
               <p>Paſſions are the inſeparable companions of mankind, and in great cities they make the greateſt havoc. Obſtacles, deſires, ſelf-created wants, every thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes, every thing creates them. Like bitumen reſiding in the heart of metals, they break forth with impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, as ſoon as they have forced the bands of infancy.</p>
               <p>Behold a young man who was juſt now under the laſh of his preceptor! Death bereft him of his parents: He is free; he is his own maſter; what a happineſs!
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:030364_0004_0FE5D133D9A6C1D8"/>
How will he enjoy it! Whole crowds of pleaſures take his fancy: which of them will he prefer? Doubtleſs the moſt turbulent, they appear ſo ſeducing? Buſtle, balls, aſſemblies, races by day!—great projects for the night; by night, great projects for the day! He is always buſy about nothing; the pleaſure he taſtes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is nothing compared to that he will taſte tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: That which he has enjoyed yeſterday is already forgotten. What pains does he take to amuſe himſelf! The gaming table—the theatres—LOVE! Why do I call it love? Can I thus proſtitute this word? Can I give the title of love to the inordinate appetites of the ſenſes, which inceſſantly pervade his heart; that inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable deſire, gratified with brutality and without choice, that inconſtant phrenzy, which makes him rove from <hi>belle</hi> to <hi>belle?</hi> Nay, he ſacrifices all, enjoys before he thinks, and thinks at the age of enjoyment. Unfortunate he! a burden to ſociety, to himſelf; at the age of thirty he may renounce life!</p>
               <p>Theſe, theſe are the fatal conſequences of paſſions, in great cities. Let us now conſider thoſe of the hamlets—let us examine the countrymen, I mean not the countrymen in the environs of Paris. Unfortunately the contagion has ſpread beyond the ſuburbs; but him that inhabits the remote provinces of Béauce or Béarn. Behold the lad at work—in his father's eyes, his age is eighteen, yet he appears to be twenty five: His nervous limbs control the ploughſhare; his callous hands thruſt the ſpade into the boſom of the earth, dragging the harrow, or lifting the flail: They threſh the corn, and each ſtroke is accompanied by a hardy <hi>hah!</hi> which ſprings from his vigorous breaſt. By day he lays up a copious ſtore of <hi>pavots</hi> for the night—by night, nothing puts him in mind of his exiſtence, not even the ſlighteſt dream, except ſometimes certain ſweet illuſions, which point, in a pleaſing manner, the labor of the approaching day. He alſo thinks on his pleaſures (for they are great objects to all men) but how innocent are they? A party at bowls, a dance in the environs of the village. The greateſt part of the Sunday he devotes to the ſervice of his God. He goes to church, not by conſtraint, or for the ſake of decorum, but by habit and duty. There he ſits with his hands

joined, and his eyes fixed upon his prieſt, who in a decayed and rough chair, at the foot of the altar, preaches maxims, which, although they be not embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the captious beauties of oratory, are however true, and adapted to the underſtandings of the auditors, who liſten to them with keen attention, and during the whole week make them the object of their reflections.</p>
               <p>In this picture, which will perhaps appear flattering. I paint the countrymen at large. I am convinced that there are vicious people in the country, as well as in town; but how rare are they among ruſtics? They have in other reſpects two excellent remedies againſt irkſomeneſs and diſeaſe—labor and ſleep. Among us, irkſomeneſs is productive of vices, and vices beget infirmities—Among them, labor procures reſt, and reſt foſters health.</p>
               <p>It is, therefore, education, which, added to our calling, or profeſſion, forms the character, the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and paſſions of men: A college education leads often to ambition, to jealouſy, to turbulence, and points out what conduct a man ought to obſerve, in order to maintain his place in the ſtormy ſociety of cities. The pupil of nature, in her rural abode, is taught by her temperance, virtue and religion.</p>
               <p>Oh! who has not felt that tranquility of mind, that admiration of a Supreme Being, when erring ſolitary through the ruſtic path? who has not ſtopt with aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, before a horizon, covered with vines, woods, meadows, hamlets, and cottages? The joyful lapſe of a caſcade throws him into a ſweet reverie! The regular noiſe of a neighboring mill entertains his melancholy—a religious calm reigns all around him—the ſun ſets, he ſees laborers paſs by, laden with tools, women and children carrying long faggots upon their backs; he hears at a diſtance the ſound of the ſhepherd's horn, who calls back his flocks to their folds; ſlow and confuſed ſounds ſtrike his ears; a little harſh and diſcordant pipe is heard at intervals—he deſcries amidſt the darkneſs the ſcintillating flame of a limekiln; he looks at it without ſeeing it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he thinks without reflecting: His ſpirits are in a ſtate of ſuſpenſe: He feels too much to give a detail of his ſenſations. Rouſed at laſt, from his extacy, every thing recalls him to his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030364_0006_0FE5D13A176D3CF8"/>
hermitage: He enters joyfully to ſee his little manſion and garden; he makes a tour round it, and remembers with delight the pleaſures of the day. Nay, how would it be poſſible he ſhould forget his walk; He has ſeen nature: He has meditated: He has enjoyed!</p>
               <p>What a ſtriking contraſt between the ſilence of the country and the buſtle of cities!</p>
               <p>Let the proud citizen of Paris leave the capital and walk only to the diſtance of half a league; let him aſcend one of theſe ſurrounding mounts, and caſt his eyes upon the turbulent city: What will he ſee? A thick blackiſh fog encompaſſing the whole maſs of its ſuperb edifice, a mephitic horizon, which ſeems too heavy to emit its exhalations! Let him hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed tumult of carriages, of dogs and horſes; let his ears tingle with the ſhrill voices of ſo many people who overrun the ſpacious diſtricts—what will he then feel? He will fetch a ſigh: Philoſophical reflections will occupy his mind: He will caſt a longing look upon the ruſtic ſeats which ſurround him. After having prolonged his excurſion, he will reenter Paris with a kind of ſadneſs, which he does not account for, and which nothing can diſſipate but the hope of ſeeing again thoſe peaceful ſcenes.</p>
               <p>Such were the thoughts of <hi>Alexis,</hi> when he left the gates of Valence. Alone, on foot, with his little bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage under his arm, he turned round, and made ſeveral ſtops, to have another view of the walls and edifices of this fine capital of the province of Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſe, where he had juſt left the deareſt and perhaps the moſt perfidious friend. He continued his road, and at laſt nothing remained to his view, but the ſummits of the capital, and the aſpiring towers of an abbey. Not knowing whither to repair, he arrives on the ſpot where the river Iſere, coming from mount Iſſerano, in Savoy, pours into the Rhone the waters which made it ſwell in Dauphiny. There he turns to the left of Romano, and enters a vaſt plain, where fatigue engages him to take repoſe. He drops down at the foot of a beach, and with ſighs reflects upon the motives which could induce his father to abandon him.</p>
               <p>The day was upon the decline; nothing but the faint ſtreaks of decreaſing light twinkled from the weſt:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030364_0007_0FE5D13B2CCD6FC8"/>
Curtains of purple ſeemed to hide the father of day from the ſight of mortals: He already caſt his laſt rays upon the brow of the mountains—all uſhered in the gloom of night—all united to reſt.</p>
               <p>Alexis, ſupporting his languiſhing head with his hand, let the evening gale ſport with the floating ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of his hair; his blue eyes, covered with the brine of woe, were lifted towards heaven: his mouth utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moans and prayer to the Supreme Being! Alexis, though only fifteen, was unfortunate and diſtreſſed.</p>
               <p>Oh! father! father! cried he, what have I done? What canſt thou upbraid me with? Why reject me from thy boſom? What crime have I committed? O my father! I do not know—they are not voluntary, if they exiſt. They are ſurely the work of fate. I am the cauſe of thy misfortunes. Alas! couldſt thou but know the heart of thy ſon; yes, thy poor Alexis, he would fain offer up his life to preſerve thine. How didſt thou love and cheriſh him! How often didſt thou preſs him to thy paternal breaſt! How often did thy tears ſhower upon him, tears whoſe ſource was latent and unknown to him! It was in thoſe delicious moments thou calledſt him thy ſon; thy little Alexis. "Dear child," thou wouldeſt ſay, "no, thou ſhalt never leave me; thou ſhalt know thy father, know his misfortunes, and adminiſter his comfort." Yet I am baniſhed and curſed by thee. Have I deſerved it? Muſt I ſee thee no more? No more thy arms will open to receive me; thy mouth will ſmile no more; thy eyes no more meet with mine. I am curſed by a father, and left alone to myſelf in nature. And you, Dumont, you my worthy friend, you too have abandoned and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Alexis: You have deceived me—Ah! it was well to tell me there was neither friendſhip nor probity on earth. All men are falſe, wicked and unjuſt: The ſtrongeſt oppreſs the weakeſt, who muſt not look for ſupport. Well, I will fly from mankind—I deteſt and abhor them. O could heaven lead me to ſome foreſt, where I may linger out this wretched exiſtence. The wild beaſts that inhabit it, are leſs dangerous than the perfidious ſerpents which lurk in ſociety. Yes, I yield
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030364_0008_0FE5D13BF2EDE338"/>
to this miſanthropy—it pleaſes me, I ſhall ſway my heart forever with ſovereign control. This city which nature erected in the form of an amphitheatre,<note n="*" place="bottom">Romans,</note> does alſo encloſe men. Paſſions, cares, devouring ambition, all theſe ſcourges are tenants there. Now is the time when the rich ſhuts himſelf up in his cloſet, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs follows him, ſhe opens his coffers, ſhe ſpreads before him the treaſures, which ſhe made him amaſs, and points out freſh means of increaſing them. Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, this cunning foe paſſes by the beggar's hut, ſhews him for a moment her ſplendor, and then takes flight, with an inſulting ſneer, at the inſatiable thirſt of the former, and the vain cravings of the latter Delivered from her importunities, the lot of a man is not in the leaſt more enviable; perfidious luſt, gloomy jealouſy, come to interrupt and diſturb his eaſe. Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, after all, recalls him to the work, which he follows till night, then returns again to give him up to the ſame enemies; and thus he ſuſtains, within the ſhort ſpace of twenty-four hours, all the paſſions with which he is obliged to ſtruggle for life.</p>
               <p>What do I ſee in the world? How vain, fooliſh, and ridiculous it appears! Shall I live in it? No, I will paſs my days in a retreat ſeparated from all other mortals; there will I bewail my diſaſtrous fate; there will I invoke the Supreme Being, and prayers may perhaps reſtore the calm of my ſoul; there ſolitude at leaſt will have nothing to interrupt it, but the remembrance of a father's curſe, and a friend's treachery.—</p>
               <p>Thus ſpoke Alexis.—Left to himſelf at fifteen, brought up by a man who ſaw every thing in a dark light, baniſhed and curſed by a father he had ſcarcely known, and whoſe very name he had never heard; his ideas became gloomy, his mind exalted, and his ſoul a prey to grief. Little was he acquainted with men. and ſhunned and deteſted them as monſters! His ſoul was never made to be conquered by that black miſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy, the only reſult of education and misfortunes. Soon ſhall we ſee him acquire ideas more ſound, more worthy of a true philoſopher—We are to ſee him in diſtreſs, but from his own fault, from an exceſſive

               <p>No ſooner had Alexis finiſhed his over ſtrained complaints, than a ſoft noiſe, which he heard behind him, made him turn his head. What does he ſee? Ah! doubtleſs it was heaven, touched by his bitter moans, which had ſent him comfort in his ſufferings.</p>

                  <p>ALEXIS MEETS A FRIEND OF CONGENIAL SENTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS.—AN INTERVIEW.—PASSAGE TOWARDS THE COTTAGE.</p>
               </argument>
               <head>THE APPROACH TO THE COTTAGE.</head>
               <p>A YOUTH of an intereſting countenance was with his head and hands leaning againſt the tree, beneath which Alexis had taken reſt. A little farther his horſe, unbridled, was browſing the vernal paſture of the plain; near him was an old man, who carefully watched all his motions.</p>
               <p>Alexis, ſurpriſed that an unknown youth ſhould teſtify concern at his fate, was going to aſk him the nature of a curioſity which rather offended him; but the young ſtranger prevented him by theſe words,—"You are diſtreſſed?"—"Diſtreſſed, you ſay—what has befallen you? what can it be to you?"—"Nay, be not angry—if you knew me!"—"Who are you?"—Well, he will know my ſecret, though he conceals his own.—"Why it is rather—<hi>how</hi> do you find me?—Such a queſtion is natural. As for me, I cannot help telling you that I look upon you as very amiable."—"Amiable!"—"Yes, charming." This confeſſion—"but pray who are you?"—"Can't you gueſs?"—"No,"—"'Tis my dreſs which cauſes your miſtake; know me then: My name is Clara, I live with my father, in a foreſt, two leagues from hence."—"In a foreſt?"—"Yes, we are very happy there."—"I believe you." "The old man who ſtands yonder, is Germain, our truſty ſervant."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:030364_0010_0FE5D141459F83A0"/>
But, fair Clara, what could induce your father to baniſh himſelf thus?"—"I don't know, it is his own ſecret, but he will tell it you." "Tell it me?"—"Certainly, won't you come and ſtay with us?"—"Why do you aſk me?"—"Have not I overheard all you ſaid, <hi>Oh, would heaven lead me to ſome foreſt, where I might linger out this wretched exiſtence.</hi>—Is not that plain enough?"—"Aye, it is ſo, I find town life is deteſtable."—"You well may, my father ſays ſo every day."—"What a ſingular adventure! your father?"—"Yes, he has been diſtreſſed too, come and live in his hermitage, you will conſole him, and I will conſole you."—"Clara, you begin already to make me forget my ſorrows; the tone of your voice is ſo ſoothing,"—"So is your own."—"Well, you have been brought up in the woods?"—"Yes, my father has been living there theſe ſix years."—"And how old are you?"—"About fifteen."—"What a beautiful, what an intereſting maid!"—"Yes, my father and Germain often told me I was handſome, and I am pleaſed that you think as they do."—What innocence! what ſimplicity! Oh, I have never been taught to hide my way of thinking, have I then met with an ingenuous and honeſt ſoul? Yes, ſhe has been brought up in the woods! "Oh! you talk like my father; how he will like you! Come, give me your hand; riſe, and we will go."—"But do you know whether your father will pleaſe to receive me?"—"Oh! he will be glad to ſee you, I am certain; I know him; he loves the unfortunate, he has been unfortunate himſelf."—"That is no reaſon; but what an impreſſion your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe makes on me!"—"Well, there is but one thing in you that diſpleaſes me."—"What is that?"—"Are you not ſometimes a little proud? I love familiarity, but come then, come along."</p>
               <p>When Alexis was firſt accoſted by the young ſtranger, he had been quite ſtruck dumb, and even on account of his miſtruſt, would not believe what Clara ſaid in the beginning, but ſhe was ſo charming! candour and innocence, the ſmile of truth, all indicated the frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her ſoul; and her features, how beautiful were they; her hair, of an aſh-colored fair, was negligently tied behind; a little round hat, with a ribbon only,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030364_0011_0FE5D14299551798"/>
diſcovered two large blue eyes, whoſe languor pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated to the heart; her mouth, with a ſmile, formed on each ſide two pretty dimples which love is ſaid to have intended to ſoften the moſt obdurate heart; her cheeks glowing with health and ingenuouſneſs, had only received the kiſſes of an affectionate father. A handkerchief paſſed ſlightly round her neck, and falling upon her boſom, left the eye to gueſs the beauties hid beneath. Her ſhape, veiled with a modeſt blue habit, was preſſed cloſer by a broad girdle, whoſe ends hung negligently down her ſide. Clara, to ſo many charms, added the age of love, and her heart, attracted by nature, had made her fly, againſt her conſent, towards a youth whom ſhe had found ſighing and melted into tears at the foot of a tree.</p>
               <p>Alexis ſurveyed her, and ſtruck with ſo many beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, his eye over-ran them with rapture. He opens his mouth to expreſs his ſurpriſe, but his tongue denies its office, and he utters only wild exclamations. He holds out his hand to the object he admires, a ſudden bluſh diffuſes itſelf over his face, a burning fire glides through his veins, he is unable to ſpeak, but his heart beats high, it comes upon his lips; it animates his looks, which only interpret his meaning.</p>
               <p>He recovers, however, from his rapture, his timidity ſtill gets the better; he turns his ſight from the fair object, ſtammers a few words, and hangs down his head with ſuch baſhful confuſion as if conſcious he had committed a crime. Oh! how pure are the firſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an honeſt love! What candor and modeſty diſplays that heart which feels them.</p>
               <p>Clara's quiet was diſturbed in the ſame manner. Brought up in the woods, accuſtomed to ſee nobody but her father and Germain, the ſight of this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing youth had made an impreſſion on her ſenſes, to which ſhe gave herſelf up entirely, without inquiring into the cauſe. She looked at Alexis, and ſaid within herſelf—How well made is he! what beautiful hair! how pretty it curls! his ſweet and rolling eye examines me! he finds me pretty! Oh, dear pleaſure! and his mouth, it opens to ſpeak to me;—it remains dumb—why?—but his heart.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:030364_0012_0FE5D14363FD41C0"/>
The two children remained for ſome time gazing on each other. At length Clara, inviting Alexis to come with her, by a ſignificant look, and a ſlight motion of her head, folded her arm round his neck, and thus they walked, without uttering a word, towards the place where Germain ſtood waiting for them. Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>them,</hi> do I ſay? He could not think that his young miſtreſs would preſent a ſtranger to him. What reception will he give him? This was all that perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clara. Eager to make Alexis live in the cottage, ſhe had not pondered the difficulties her deſign was likely to encounter, not with regard to her father, for ſhe was ſure of the reception he would give to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate youth; but Germain was miſtruſtful, hard, inſenſible, and unfortunately enjoyed the entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his maſter. A young man baniſhed, curſed by his parents, friendleſs, without ſhelter, all this excited ſuſpicion. Poor Clara felt it, and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore afraid leſt the old ſervant ſhould treat her young friend rudely, and ſend him away.</p>
               <p>Her uneaſineſs increaſed the more ſhe advanced towards this auſtere Mentor. At laſt ſhe comes up to him, ſhe muſt accoſt and appriſe him. What an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment! "Germain," ſays ſhe, "You love my father, you know how unfortunate he has been! you comforted him, and diverted his tedious moments. Let us render the ſame ſervice to this poor youth; he is as virtuous and innocent as any one; and, alas! fate purſues him as it purſued my father;"—"How do you know him, Clara?" ſaid Germain.—"He was weeping and ſighing beneath yon tree; I approached, he related to me his misfortunes, and I was happy to wipe away his tears."—"Young man, who art thou?"—"Good old man, I am nothing, unleſs you reckon it ſomething to be a fellow creature."—"Of what country?"—"I cannot tell."—"Your father's name?"—"I know not."—"What is his profeſſion?"—"Alas! I cannot tell."—"You cannot tell?"—"No, he curſed and baniſhed me, and never let me know my crime."</p>
               <p>Whilſt Alexis was ſaying this Clara whiſpered him quite low, "Huſh, why do you tell him that?" but Alexis proceeded—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030364_0013_0FE5D14B46940948"/>
"Till now he had me educated at a college, at Paris. He once loved me."</p>
               <p>"Your anſwers," ſaid Germain, "are ſo many enigmas; and you, Clara, what makes you bring this ſtranger to me? What is your deſign? What would you have <hi>me</hi> do, what does he want of me?"</p>
               <p>Alexis, foreſeeing a refuſal in this queſtion of the old man, could not reſtrain his indignation. "I want nothing," anſwered he, angrily, and ſprung from them, caſting a look of melancholy towards Clara, who felt its full force. "Only ſee," ſaid ſhe to Germain, "ſee, he goes away; the poor youth; you will not prevent him. Alexis, Alexis!"</p>
               <p>But Alexis would not hear her, and running like a man who has committed a crime, he conſidered what had happened as a great inſult, which ought forever to cover him with ſhame. "What, ſaid he, ſobbing, I believed I had found a generous heart; I condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſolicit ſhelter and have been refuſed; I ought to have expected it. The man who is proſperous in all, ſees the ſorrow of the wretched as he who has dined views the poor ſtarved with hunger. Nobody will deſcend into the heart of the unfortunate. One always finds fault with the diſtreſſed to exempt one's ſelf from alleviating his ſorrows. I will follow my fate, I will forget this adventure; but, Clara, I ſhall ſee thee no more! Thy ſoul had judged mine; thy pity was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. One only being ſhares in my ſufferings, and I cannot live near her! O God, O God!"</p>
               <p>He could proceed no further: His heart was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with renewed grief, tears flowed from his eyes, and he gave himſelf up to deſpair.</p>
               <p>He purſued his way, not daring to look back, leſt he might meet Germain's eye, and wandered thus two hours, without knowing whither, when the proſpect of a little wood offered itſelf to his view, and here he reſolved to paſs the night.</p>
               <p>It was in the month of June; the moon ſhone in her full luſtre; a light breeze refreſhed the air, and twenty green ſods preſented a commodious bed to the ſtraying traveller. Alexis did not heſitate: He addreſſes, as uſual, a prayer to the Supreme Being, and throws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon a riſing turf at the entrance of a little wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:030364_0014_0FE5D14C12E280D0"/>
There, ſtretched upon the graſs, which he bedewed with his tears, lay poor Alexis, who, but the night before, was with his friend Dumont, received from him the moſt affectionate marks of the livelieſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and flattered himſelf with the hope of embracing his father at the riſing dawn. He had indeed ſeen that cruel father, but far from being careſſed, ſuffered his angrieſt looks, and his malediction. Lo! what a change in his fate! Behold him alone, left to himſelf; fatherleſs, friendleſs, deſtitute; life an odious burden to him; he yields it up to the mercy of ferocious animals, of robbers, and already bleſſes the hand of the cruel being that will take it from him.</p>
               <p>He had juſt cloſed his reflections, and the ſalutary balm of ſleep was beginning to lull his ſenſes, and make him loſe the remembrance of his ills, when he was alarmed by loud ſhrieks, and could diſtinguiſh a voice, crying, "O heavens! will you kill me? Have pity on my tender years." Alexis jumps up, the voice affects him, he thinks he knows it, and flies to the ſpot from which the moans proceed. Horrible ſight! Will his heart be able to bear it? A youth, covered with blood, whom a ruffian dragged by the hair, implored his aſſiſtance, 'Tis Clara, cried Alexis—ruſhing upon the barbarian, he reſcues her. The wretch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foaming with rage, draws a piſtol from his pocket, and is about to fire it, when Alexis, ſpringing upon him, wreſted the weapon from his hand, and ſhoots him dead.</p>
               <p>Clara, who had fainted, no ſooner opened her eyes than ſhe recogniſed her deliverer. "Is it you? <hi>you</hi> to whom I owe my life? O unexpected happineſs!"—"But, Clara," ſaid Alexis, "where is Germain?"—"About twenty yards farther, and dangerouſly wounded."—"Let us fly to him."</p>
               <p>They found the old man upon the ground weltering in his blood. "Is it you," ſaid he, "is it you, my Clara? what deity reſtores you to my wiſhes?"—"Here he is Germain I know my defender; it is Alexis!"—"What, that young man?"—"The ſame."—"O generous ſtranger! how great are my obligations to you! I ſhall reſtore a daughter to a father; through you I ſhall die contented."—"You die!" replied Alexis, "let me not loſe the benefit of the ſervice I
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030364_0015_0FE5D14CDA8BA780"/>
have been ſo fortunate to render you."—"Give me your hand then," ſaid Germain, "and deign to crown this heroic ſeat, by accompanying us to the virtuous Candor, to whom we are equally dear."</p>
               <p>Alexis and Clara helped Germain to riſe, and ſtopped his blood with their handkerchiefs. His wound was not dangerous; he had only a ſlight contuſion upon his ſhoulder, and a great loſs of blood alone had weakened him. The two young people, with ſome difficulty, aſſiſted him to mount his horſe; Clara got up behind him, and thus, followed by Alexis, they proceeded to the next village, which they reached by day-break.</p>
               <p>Upon the road, Clara informed her young deliverer, that ſhe and Germain, having loſt their way, and being ſenſible they had rode farther than the diſtance from Romans to their cottage, they fell in, about twenty yards from the little wood, with a robber, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their money, or their lives; that the wretch had fired a piſtol at Germain, and ſhe having told him that ſhe was a woman, he dragged her to the place where he received the puniſhment due to his crimes. She added that if any thing could comfort her in this cruel accident, it was to have met with a friend ſo high in her eſteem, and who hereafter would be the friend of her father and his old ſervant.</p>
               <p>Alexis returned thanks for her concern, and our three travellers reached <hi>St. Marcellin,</hi> a pretty little town, where Germain remembered he had been many a time. They would have done better had they gone ſtraight to <hi>La Perriere,</hi> a village on this ſide the town; but quite unacquainted with the road, they ſtrayed ſo much from the high way, that having gained the right ſhore of the Iſer they were obliged to travel two leagues farther in order to reach <hi>St. Marcellin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was there Germain had his wound dreſſed, and finding he had ſtrength ſufficient to ride farther, he engaged his young companions to repair inſtantly with him to the cottage, where Candor would probably be alarmed at their abſence. Clara longed to ſee him. Alexis ſeared his preſence, from his invincible timidity, for he was ſtill diſmayed at the cold reception which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030364_0016_0FE5D14D9E583040"/>
Germain had given him: He was afraid leſt Clara's father ſhould treat him in the ſame manner, and could not help appearing trembling before him; but Candor's daughter cheered his ſpirits; and having ſet out all three, they came in ſight of a dark foreſt, ſituated between <hi>St. Marcellin, St. Etienne,</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> This foreſt, which is about ten leagues in extent, and is renowned for robbers, and the precipices diſperſed throughout it, ſeemed to be the marked ſpot of celeſtial vengeance. Its denſe and lofty trees were continually ſhivered by the lightning, and blaſting winds ſpent their rage upon it without intermiſſion. Every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance denoted horror and dread.</p>
               <p>It was, however, in the centre of this diſmal place, where Candor and his daughter had choſen their abode. It was there they had erected their cottage, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it againſt ſurpriſe; but I ought not to anticipate a deſcription which will be given hereafter. Let us, for a moment, follow our three travellers, who will ſoon reach their manſion, and receive the embraces of a father who will become the father of my hero.</p>
               <p>Clara, always behind the old man, held Alexis by the hand, who, like a faithful ſquire, walked on foot by her ſide. They had by this time travelled about four leagues through the buſhes and hedges of the vaſt foreſt, when they deſcried in a dale a little fortreſs which Alexis ſurveyed with aſtoniſhment. Here Clara, gently preſſing the youth's hand, with a ſmile, ſaid to him—<hi>"There, do you ſee the cottage?"</hi>

               <p>"THERE, <hi>do you ſee the cottage?"</hi> it is there we live, and there it will depend on yourſelf to live with us."—"Ah! Clara," ſaid Alexis, "What a

delicious abode! how bleſt would be my lot if your father, if Germain—"</p>
               <p>"Doubt it not, my lovely deliverer," anſwered Germain, "doubt it not, but before you ſettle there, ponder well what you are about to do; to renounce the world is the queſtion, and at your age—"</p>
               <p>"It is the very time I ſhould renounce it," cried Alexis, "had I done it before, I would not have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much now."</p>
               <p>"But have mankind already given you ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deteſt them?" "Thoſe who were dear to me have betrayed me; what can I expect from ſtrangers?"</p>
               <p>"You perhaps conſider them in a prejudiced light."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I have but too much experience."</p>
               <p>"But if you deteſt the men, do you alſo include in your hatred that noble half of ſociety, which aſſuages our ſorrows, and which, by love, allays the grief cauſed by friendſhip! women! will you fly them at eighteen?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! I ſee them all in Clara."</p>
               <p>"That's right," replied ſhe with vivacity; "as for me, I ſee all men in my father, my good friend, and Alexis."</p>
               <p>"Young people," purſued Germain, "be on your guard, beware of your hearts; love in the midſt of woods?"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean," interrupted Clara, "what, ſhould I love him? No, I am concerned at his fate becauſe he is unfortunate, and I owe him the gratitude due to a deliverer."</p>
               <p>"And I," ſaid Alexis, "ſhould be much wanting in duty, were I inſenſible of her generous offer, and the manner ſhe conſoled me in my afflictions."</p>
               <p>"Without doubt!" continued the old man, ſhaking his head; "friendſhip, gratitude, they are all fine pretences; come, come, march on." Such was their converſation, when the cottage appeared before them; a foſſe full of water guarded its dominion all round to the bottom of a high and ſtrong wall, which encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed a ſpacious yard, in the middle of which the little edifice ſtood. A draw bridge that could be let down upon the foſſe, defended the entrance againſt the robbers who made the foreſt their abode.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:030364_0018_0FE5D156A6FDC408"/>
Candor, alarmed at the long abſence of his two ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, had mounted the walls at day break, and caſt his wiſhful eyes upon the dreary expanſe of the woods, in which he feared ſame accident might have befallen them. Clara's father was old and infirm, and ſcarce able to walk; but he no ſooner deſcried his dear gueſts from a diſtance, than he deſcended from the wall, leaned upon his ſtaff, and his heart leaping for joy, he let down the draw bridge, the levers of which were made lighter by a counterpoiſe. He, however, expected his friends alone: He ſaw three approach. He did not know the ſtranger who led Clara by the hand, and to whom Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſpoke in ſo affectionate a manner. They had no acquaintance; he himſelf in his ſolitude where he lived unknown had forgot all mankind, who had alſo forgot him. Who then was the youth they brought? His modeſt exterior, his ſweet countenance, prepoſſeſſed him in his favor; but after all, he could by no means recollect him.</p>
               <p>The good Candor, in the midſt of thoſe reflections, ſaw our two cavaliers alight before the premiſes. "O my father," ſaid Clara, throwing herſelf into his arms; "we have been on the point of never ſeeing you again!"—"How, my dear daughter?"—"A villain," continued Clara, "has wounded Germain, and would have taken away my life, but for the bravery of this traveller, who delived me out of his clutches, and inflicted that puniſhment upon him, which he ſo well deſerved."—"O my child: What! Germain?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed," anſwered he, "we would both have been loſt, without the poor Alexis, this courageous youth: He is very unfortunate, my dear maſter; give me leave to tell you how we met with him; and it will convince you of his virtuous diſpoſition, and his delicacy."</p>
               <p>Here Germain gave Clara's father a minute account of all that had happened; he mentioned firſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with Alexis in the valley of Romans, and related every ſubſequent particular to the moment when they alighted before the draw bridge of the cottage, dwelling chiefly upon the abrupt manner in which Alexis had left them the night before, which he ſaid, in his opinion, proceeded from a ſenſe of conviction
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030364_0019_0FE5D157991DA060"/>
that he would not take him with him; this he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as a proof of his ſenſibility and his nice feelings.</p>
               <p>Our young hero was much embarraſſed during this converſation: His head hung down, his eyes were fixed upon the ground; he dared not lift them upon the old man, whoſe reverend appearance increaſed his ſhyneſs; his heart was depreſſed and he appeared as if ready to ſwoon. On the other hand, Clara made comments on every thing that Germain ſaid, in order to add to the praiſe, the eagerly conſulted her father's eyes to watch what impreſſion the narrative would make upon him.</p>
               <p>When Germain had done ſpeaking, Candor pauſed a moment, and then, addreſſing Alexis, who now trembled more than ever, "Young man," ſaid he, "what is your age?"—"I ſhall ſoon be eighteen."—"Eighteen, and ſo much virtue, ſuch misfortunes, and ſuch courage! Do you wiſh to live with us? come, you are too timid, ſpeak, I love the unfortunate; they have a claim upon my heart."</p>
               <p>"Generous man!" cried Alexis, "what concern he gives me!"</p>
               <p>"Will you then renounce ſociety and fly all ſocial intercourſe?"</p>
               <p>"Why, are not all men falſe, wicked, and treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous?"</p>
               <p>How well he knows them! "But, my young friend, I cannot receive you into my houſe, unleſs you give me an open and candid account of your misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and ſituation: I wiſh alſo to know if your reaſons for quitting ſociety are ſolid and conſiſtent?"</p>
               <p>"They are, and ſhall be forever!"</p>
               <p>"Well, people at your age are generally of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way of thinking: But at mine they are prudent and conſiſtent. The man who would leave me at the firſt opportunity, ſhall have no acceſs to my houſe."</p>
               <p>"I will never leave you, my father, no, never."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father!</hi> how he moves me! alas, my ſon would now have been as old as he! his frankneſs! I ſaw him expire before my eyes; unfortunate child!</p>
               <p>Here, Candor wiped the tears which trickled from his eyes, and, reſuming his former firmneſs—"Come,

Alexis, come, accept a ſhelter offered by friendſhip, but remember that this gate which is going to be ſhut will never open for you again."</p>
               <p>Alexis kiſſed the hand of his benefactor, and Clara was tranſported with joy, and all four paſſed over the draw bridge, which flew up ſuddenly behind them. Now our hero had a diſtinct view of the cottage, which the high walls that were its defence, had hitherto concealed from him.</p>
               <p>The building was ſquare, conſiſted of freeſtone, and was but one ſtory high, without ornaments, without the beauties of architecture, it contained every domeſtic convenience. Below was a kitchen, and an oven to bake the bread, &amp;c. The firſt floor contained two commodious apartments, the one inhabited by Candor, the other by Clara. Above it were two little rooms occupied by Germain, and the remainder ſupplied the place of a granary, where grains and pulſes were drying in ſummer, to be the family proviſion in the winter. The apartments contained no other furniture than a bed, a table, and ſome chairs.—In that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Clara, ſtood a very fine harpſichord, on which ſhe had learned to play, as we ſhall find hereafter, and which diverted her leiſure, and ſerved to diſſipate Candor's melancholy thoughts.</p>
               <p>On the left hand, in the yard, was a ſtable for their horſe, and a large box containing all the implements required for huſbandry and gardening: On the right, rain water was let in from the foſſe into a pond, which ſupplied the drink of our hermits, after they had clarified it.</p>
               <p>Behind the building, all within the encloſure was a kitchen garden, cultivated by Germain and Clara, in which they ſowed all kinds of vegetables and other garden ſtuff, which they purchaſed at St. Marcellin. They had plenty of peas, beans, potatoes, &amp;c. which was proviſion for them all the year round, for they eat no other meat than fowls, which they had in plenty in their little yard, ſituated towards the left wing of the building. Theſe particulars ſhew us that they did not want for neceſſaries, and from the account Candor ſhall give of his misfortunes, we ſhall ſee how he could procure them. Let us now return to Alexis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030364_0021_0FE5D159DF969BE0"/>
When Clara and Candor had ſhown him the cottage, the old man made him ſtep into a parlor, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him, previous to his aſſigning him a room, to relate the ſtory of his infancy. "My ſon," ſaid he, "be true, hide nothing, nor even palliate your faults; you have undoubtedly committed ſome, eſpecially at your age; you would not elſe be human; I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them if they do not ſpring from the heart. Speak and be candid."</p>
               <p>Alexis complied, and Germain, who unſaddled the horſe while they were walking round the premiſes, having joined them again, our young hero thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced the ſtory of his misfortunes, which will prove, eſpecially to fathers of families, how careful they ſhould be in the choice of a PRECEPTOR FOR THEIR CHILDREN.</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell you," began Alexis, "the place of my birth, nor my father's name, as both have always been a ſecret to me. As far as I am able to recollect, I was in my tender infancy, in the arms of a good old woman, whom I uſed to call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, but who, I was informed afterwards, was nowiſe related to me, yet ſhe did not tell me who were my real parents. That good woman had the care of my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation till I was ten, and received punctually every month, by an unknown hand, a conſiderable ſum for my board. Under her care I learned to read, to write, to caſt accounts, and the firſt elements of dancing and muſic, ſtudies which I continued at college, where ſhe told me one day, ſhe had orders to conduct me; we then lived at Paris, in <hi>rus de la Chaſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Mrs. Delys (this was the name of my good gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs) was in affluent circumſtances; ſhe had been left a widow for upwards of ſixteen years, by her huſband, an officer of the horſe, who had bequeathed to her an annual income of two thouſand crowns: She had reſolved to ſpend her life in a ſolitary part of the metropolis, far from company, which had become baleful to her, ſince the death of a beloved ſon, who fell in a duel, by the hands of a friend, in conſequence of a quarrel. Though ten years had elapſed ſince his death, his mother ſtill bewailed him daily, would receive no kind of viſit, and ſpent her time in talking
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030364_0022_0FE5D16342EA3B28"/>
to me about the virtues of her poor Delys, the treachery of his friend, and the falſity of men. Thus ſhe talked to me, a child incapable of underſtanding, and ſtill leſs of comforting her. How ſhe would weep! I wept with her without knowing why, and we mingled our tears. You ſee that the firſt dawn of my life ſpent in ſadneſs, has not a little contribued to give me a gloomy, fretful, and anxious diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>"I aſked her many times with regard to my parents, and blamed her for her obſtinacy in concealing them from me; her anſwer was that ſhe herſelf did not know them; that ſhe educated me to oblige her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's brother, who knew them, and kept it a ſecret; that all ſhe knew was, that I ought to look upon my exiſtence as fatality, and that the hiſtory of my birth, ſhould it ever come to my knowledge, would inſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e me with horror, and make me wretched for life. To be ſure, all this was not very pleaſing; on the other hand, Mrs. Delys ſpoke with ſuch warmth on the ſubject, that I might well ſuppoſe I was related to her.</p>
               <p>"I never went any where but to church. Thither I was always conveyed in a carriage, the glaſſes of which Mrs. Delys took great care to ſhut every time. In a word, being ſo much hidden from the world, and ſhut up as it were in a box, that nobody ſhould ſee me, I conceived the whole in an ominous light, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my little way of arguing, I could foreſee nothing but fatality on account of ſuch a conduct.</p>
               <p>"One day, Mrs. Delys took me privately into her apartment, telling me, with tears in her eyes, "My dear friend, you are to leave me! we muſt part, my ſweet child."—"Muſt we part, madam?"—"You cry, you are ſorry to part, ſo am I; but it muſt be: But I am not ſufficient to complete your education. You are born, ſhould the decrees of fate relent in your favor, to hold, ſome day, an important rank in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety."—"I am told ſo," anſwered I, "I muſt yield to neceſſity."—"You are to go," continued Mrs. Delys, "to a college, to receive a complete univerſity education; then, I know not how fate will diſpoſe of you—but, come, my lovely child, ſubmit and never forget, in your new abode, the virtuous principles which I have endeavored to inculcate in your breaſt;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030364_0023_0FE5D1640D0173D8"/>
have never too intimate a connexion with your col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, and miſtruſt their careſſes as you would their hatred: Alas! he that bereft me of my ſon, was his fellow ſtudent—adieu! they are coming to fetch you. Mr. Dumont, as abbé of a reſpectable character, is choſen by your parents to have you under his care; he is to live with you; in a word, conſider him as your preceptor, but as a faithful friend; make him your confidant; he is, I believe, a worthy man."</p>
               <p>"I remained motionleſs at this diſcourſe, and when Mrs. Delys had done, I let flow my tears, in freedom; I threw myſelf at her feet, and ſolicited to remain with her, when my new mentor entered, and by his appearance, chilled me with terror.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dumont was about forty, tall, ſlender, and lean; but his countenance, which bore the ſtamp of brobity and frankneſs, diſpelled my fear, and made me approach him by degrees.</p>
               <p>"This, ſir, is he," ſaid Mrs. Delys, "the poor child! you ſee how he regrets me!"—"That he ought, madam," anſwered Mr. Dumont, politely, "but will you not ſometimes come and ſee him?"—Oh! very often."—"Well, you ſhould both ſeek comfort in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; come, my little friend, come with me: I frighten you, don't I? You may ſay ſo freely, but be aſſured, there is nothing diſmal about me, but my dreſs; you inſpire me with too much concern that I ſhould not love you; I will be your friend, and believe me, ſhould you unfortunately be kept from your father, you will find a father in me."</p>
               <p>This ſpeech ſomewhat allayed my terrors: I ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered ſome thanks, and having once more thrown myſelf into Mrs. Delys's arms, I followed Mr. Dumont who affectionately laid hold of my hand, ſqueezed it, and conducted me to the carriage. A ſervant whom I had never ſeen, put up and faſtened my trunk on behind, and my tutor gave me to underſtand that the ſame man was to wait upon us at college.</p>
               <p>The coachman drove faſt, and ſet us down at the college of Navarre, a porter came to open the gate and ſhut in immediately after us. It was then I felt my heart beat, my knees tottered, and I felt indiſpoſed. The abbé and my ſervant carried me to the maſter's
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030364_0024_0FE5D164D38DDC00"/>
apartment, where I recovered, and ſaw myſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by pedants in black gowns, who with a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious mein, and declamatory voice, ſaid among themſelves—"This is the way of all the children; how idleneſs and indolence work them; and then, you ſee, they are ſpoiled by their parents at home, but that will not do here; the <hi>ferula</hi> muſt cure them—Well, my little maſter, are you better now? Never mind, never mind. Today he ſhall have a holiday; he ſhall not ſtudy; is not that very pretty? But tomorrow he muſt go to books, and ſhow himſelf very docile, very ſtudious; won't you, my little man?"</p>
               <p>"I made no anſwer; this black tribe almoſt fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened me out of my wits, and but for Mr. Dumont, who ſeemed leſs ill natured than theſe, I think I ſhould have run away. I came thither like a lamb conducted to the ſlaughter houſe, without knowing what was wanted of me, I let them talk and prepared myſelf for all events.</p>
               <p>My preceptor ſtaid for a few minutes with the maſter, in another apartment, and I was left alone trembling before three abbés, who aſked me ſeveral queſtions, which I did not anſwer. Soon they roſe, and mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among themſelves, I heard them ſay, "What a blockhead of a boy! Nay, he's baſhful. Baſhful, no, it is ſtupidity: He will give us ſome trouble! But we will manage him," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dumont ſhortly after returned to the apartment, and the maſter conducted us to a ſpacious room, which he ſaid was to be ours; he then retired, patting me upon the cheek, and commanding me to be a <hi>very good boy.</hi> I had longed to ſee him gone, in order to give vent to my ſorrow; Mr. Dumont conſoled me; dinner was ſerved, but I could not eat, and remained ſad all day long.</p>
               <p>Next morning Mr. Dumont put a Rudiments into my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>and, informed me that I was to be received into a claſs. I performed what he bid me, although I did not well underſtand what he ſaid. At one o'clock Mrs. Delys came to ſee me, exhorting me to aſſume that firmneſs which my new way of life would exact. Her appearance recalled my ſorrow, but at laſt ſhe left me, and I took a reſolution to be ſteady.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:030364_0025_0FE5D248256885D8"/>
"I began to accuſtom myſelf to Mr. Dumont's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; he was, in other reſpects, gloomy and ſerious, and his temper bore the ſtricteſt conformity to mine. I aſked him one day if he knew my father, and if it was he who had placed me under his care? He anſwered me with all the frankneſs which I had many opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to remark in him afterwards, that he was entirely ignorant of my parents; that a man, ſuppoſed about thirty-five years old, who he ſaw frequently at the houſe of a lady of his acquaintance, and who ſeemed to entertain the livelieſt concern for me, had aſked him whether he would undertake the education of the ſon of a friend of his, and having been anſwered in the affirmative, he, Mr. Dumont, had been directed by the ſtranger to the college of Navarre, and received the ſum of twenty-five <hi>louis,</hi> with an aſſurance that the expenſes of board, &amp;c. ſhould be punctually paid.—"Be it as it will," added Mr. Dumont, "I am much induced to believe that man to be your father, becauſe you are a perfect likeneſs of him."—I begged him to aſk of that lady, the firſt time he ſhould ſee her again, the name and quality of the perſon whom he ſuppoſed to be my father. He promiſed to comply with my requeſt, but unfortunately that woman, who alone could give us information, ſet out that very day for a long journey, from which it appears ſhe is not yet returned, for I never heard of her afterwards.</p>
               <p>"In a little time I made amazing progreſs under ſo worthy a preceptor, who found out the way to gain my entire confidence; but what ingratiated him moſt with me, was the converſation we had frequently together on ſubjects of morality. It is to him I owe the faculty of thinking, reflecting, and reaſoning. How valuable were his leſſons! I ſhall remember them forever.</p>
               <p>"Men had ſo much deceived him that he placed no truſt in them, and he gave me on that head the moſt wholeſome advice, which I have ſince learned to put in practice.—Thus would he argue, pray be attentive and I have no doubt but you will agree with me, that he was not miſtaken.</p>
               <p>"There is no medium," he would ſay, "in ſociety. You muſt deceive; you muſt <hi>be</hi> deceived, or cringe. To dazzle others, to give one's ſelf titles, eſtates,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030364_0026_0FE5D1676D1E3B60"/>
qualities, or virtues which one has not, to flatter the ways of another, this I call <hi>to deceive.</hi> If you deſire to gain the favor of the great, you muſt imitate their vices, or at leaſt feign to imitate them. If they are libertines, you muſt be a libertine too; if they gamble, you muſt gamble; if they drink, you muſt drink, elſe you are <hi>inſupportable high minded, infected with prejudice, unengaging, unſociable,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"You muſt <hi>be deceived,</hi> when liſtening to the big talk of thoſe who have done all, ſeen all, and are capable of all! You are allured by the bark, without examining whether the heart of the tree is not worm-eaten. You confide in them, you open your heart to them: They abuſe your confidence on purpoſe to undo you, on purpoſe to draw you into their ſnares, from which you will frequently have to extricate yourſelf at the expenſe of your honor, your fortune, and your health.</p>
               <p>"You find yourſelf obliged to cringe, when not being the dupe of the ſottiſh pride of ſome, and the vices of others, you conform to a certain degree with their manner of living. It is then you create yourſelf a ſyſtem of your own, when you regulate your conduct, and adopt ſweet and polite manners, and ceaſe to be their confidant. It is then people will obſerve you, for your wit, your abilities, or your fortune, and will ſay, Mr. ſuch-a one is no doubt amiable, but he is a poor ſoul, that has no energy, no paſſions; it is a good thing, you may make of him what you pleaſe, elſe he would be inſufferable in ſpite of all his probity.</p>
               <p>"Neceſſity, pride, or indolence alone make the world cultivate your friendſhip. Are you above it? It will flatter you. Are you beneath it? It will <hi>protect</hi> you, as we call it. All you can expect from it is meanneſs and humiliation. I ſhall ſay nothing of treachery, ſlanders, calumny, things which make havoc in ſociety. You muſt expect them, as ſoon as you ſet out in the world. What intereſt, therefore, can make you deſire it? None. The inference is plain—fly from it."</p>
               <p>"Thus ſpoke Mr. Dumont, and his principles became engraven on my mind with indelible force. Fond of ſolitude, and without acquaintance, we never went out. On holidays only we took a walk in the fields, for he
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030364_0027_0FE5D16CD849AE90"/>
did not like thoſe gaudy places of reſort, where luxury parades in idle expence, and attracts the vain admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome, and the fooliſh deſires others. We always took a book with us, a book of morality, of the very ſerious, of the very <hi>ſombre</hi> kind, which we got by heart, and often ſpent whole hours in reflecting and commenting upon a ſingle phraſe.</p>
               <p>"How pleaſing were thoſe rural excurſions! Happy times! I think I am ſtill upon theſe favorite ſpots; often we ſat on the top of a hill to ſee the ſetting ſun, and ſtruck with the ſublimity of that auguſt ſcene, we would ſay within ourſelves—that almighty BEING that thus extinguiſhes the bright glory of the day! how great muſt he be! Then caſting our eyes upon the capital, we only perceived the faint glimpſes of the lamps that lighted it, and ruminated upon the diſorders committed there by the indolent and profligate. We were charmed—though we ſighed—with the happy quiet ariſing from the ſimplicity and innocence of our pleaſures.</p>

               <p>BY this time I had been three months at the college of Navarre, and received no other viſit than that of Mrs. Delys, who came to ſee us ſometimes. She became very intimate with Mr. Dumont, and we made a mutual exchange of books, which were our only pleaſure. Uncertein if I ſhould ever diſcover my parents, I armed myſelf with patience, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with my lot, when one day my man Vincent informed Mr. Dumont, that a gentleman in an elegant carriage had juſt alighted, and wiſhed to ſpeak to him in private. My preceptor goes to meet him—both
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030364_0028_0FE5D16DA5D95C90"/>
enter another apartment, and wait together about an hour. So long an interview began to make me uneaſy, but Mr. Dumont joined me, and ſaid in a whiſper, with great appearance of joy, "This is the perſon who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted me with your education, and whom I ſuppoſe to be your father. He was juſt given me fifty more louis d'ors for your ſecond quarter, and deſires you to take a dancing, a drawing, and muſic-maſter. Oh! he will bring you up a little prince!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, ſir," interrupted I, "cannot I ſee him?"—"This is what I aſked," anſwered he, "but he much objected againſt that favor; at laſt he complied, on condition of his putting on a maſk before he enters: No doubt he does it to hide that ſtriking reſemblance, which, as I have already obſerved, there is between you."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" cried I, "let him appear as he likes—let me but ſee him! Let me bathe his feet with my tears."</p>
               <p>"Stop, ſtop," ſaid Dumont, "be moderate, and ſave appearances."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dumont left me, and returned a moment after with the ſtranger, who had actually maſked his face.</p>
               <p>"You muſt grant, my amiable friends, that I was much diſconcerted at ſuch a moment. What counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance could I keep! No doubt I was to wait till he ſhould ſpeak to me firſt. Nevertheleſs, I could hardly forbear throwing myſelf into his arms—and you ſhall hear the whole account of a ſcene ſo intereſting to me, and which, as long as I live, ſhall be engraved on my memory. I ſaluted the unknown perſon with reſpect, and he beckoned me to be ſeated. Vincent gave us chairs, and left the apartment, I perceived that the man in a maſk was tottering, and agitated by a trouble, which it was in vain for him to conceal. At laſt he ſat down, and began to examine me; I could collect from the heaving of his breaſt that his heart was beating, and that he could ſcarcely fetch breath. All theſe tokens ſerved to confirm my doubts, but, far more trembling and moved than he, I dared not to look at him, or make the ſmalleſt geſture. This dumb ſcene had laſted long, when Mr. Dumont, ſenſible that it affected us too much, haſtened to interrupt it with addreſſing himſelf to me.</p>

"Alexis," ſaid he, "this is the gentleman who is ſo good as to ſupply your wants, and to have you educated."—"Ah! ſir, how kind in you."—"Deſerve it by your docility and a cloſe attention to Mr. Dumont's leſſons."—"Yes, ſir, nothing could have been a more convincing proof of the kindneſs of my <hi>parents</hi> than a choice of ſo worthy a preceptor,'—"Who told you," ſaid the ſtranger, "that Mr. Dumont has been choſen by your parents!"—"Why, ſir, have I no parents?"—"Unfortunate boy! mayeſt thou never know them!"—"O heaven! you know them well, you know them, ſir?"—"No queſtions, if you pleaſe."—"Ah! ſhould you ſee my father, tell him—tell him that his little Alexis cannot live without embracing him, without falling at his feet! he ſeeks him through nature ever ſince he was born; he calls aloud to him; he ſcrutinizes every eye, every face—but, alas! nobody has heard his cries."—"unreaſonable boy! what wouldeſt thou have?"—"I'll ſee my father! I'll preſs him to my heart!"—"He cannot ſhow himſelf to you, he cannot indeed!"—"Is he, then, barbarous, hard-hearted, inflexible? Ah, does not the voice of nature appeal to his paternal breaſt? He is obliged to ſtifle her voice; nay, can he who loves ſo well do it?"—"You move me!"—"You ſhed tears; ah, let me ſee them from your reſpectable face. Throw away, pray throw away this deceitful maſk; it does not become the man of feeling; ſir, here I lie at your feet; in pity no longer conceal my father; I conjure you by your own, if he yet be living; I can ſee your perplexity! Well, if you love <hi>him,</hi> if <hi>he</hi> is dear to you, you cannot reprove my filial emotions!

               <p>Here I dropt upon the floor in an agony of grief. Mr. Dumont, moved by my appearance, exhorted and entreated the ſtranger to put an end to my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whilſt the latter, who, with the livelieſt emotions, was ſtruggling, ſobbing, and looking at me, li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"But he relapſed again into ſilence, and when I ſaw that nothing could move him, I became furious; in a moment my eyes were dry, and with a noble firmneſs I made an effort to triumph over myſelf. In a tone of reſpect and aſſurance, I ſaid—"Well, ſir, I ſee you are fully bent on my deſpair. I know what reſolution is left for me. Since I have no parents who love me, I have nothing to tie me to nature. What ſhould I do? what fate awaits me? Shame, misfortune, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny.

                  </gap>elt you before! how dear were theſe embraces! I wept, laughed, and committed a thouſand extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, and we were all three like diſtracted perſons. I ſay all three, for Mr. Dumont, whom this ſcene had moved to tears, who ſhared our ſadneſs, now ſhared out joy; in a word, we were in a manner electrified at the ſame inſtant by various ſentiments, which glided through our frame with the greateſt rapidity.</p>
               <p>After my father had given vent to his ſenſibility, he made us again ſit down, and addreſſed me thus: "My ſon, I have had the ſtrongeſt motives to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to you, and ſtill preſerve them. You have juſt torn from me a ſecret which ought to have died with me. But I ſhall not repent if you promiſe to obey the laws I am now to preſcribe to you. In the firſt place,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030364_0031_0FE5D173EAA60B88"/>
I forbid you to aſk me the leaſt queſtion reſpecting my name and quality. It may ſuffice you to know that you are born a nobleman, in order to prevent you from committing an action unworthy of your deſcent: But I cannot tell you who I am—my life and your own would ſoon be at ſtake. In the ſecond place, I forbid you to follow me, or expreſs the ſmalleſt curioſity to know me farther. Should I find you guilty of this. I ſhall abandon and never ſee you again. Theſe laws aſtoniſh you, I can believe; but I am compelled to preſcribe them. Alas! you have made my life the ſummit of human wretchedneſs. It is your birth that has made me commit a crime the moſt—do not urge me to proceed; you would puniſh my imprudence! I will viſit you—I will write to you, but <hi>never, never,</hi> ſhall you know my name! As for you, Mr. Dumont, I need not exact of you the ſame circumſpection of conduct. You are an honeſt man: I am ſure of it. The perſon at whoſe houſe I became acquainted with you has given me an account of your misfortunes. They do you credit. Adieu, my ſon; be aſſured that I ſhall never forſake you, and ſhall ever watch over you and your education."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dumont and I gazed on this aſtoniſhing man, who laid upon us ſuch ſingular injunctions; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with his misfortunes which inſpired us with the moſt lively concern, we judged them to be of the moſt afflicting kind, as he had deprived himſelf ſo long of the ſight of a ſon, who ſeemed to engroſs his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to whom, even when careſſing him, he dared not to reveal either his name or his rank.</p>
               <p>At length he roſe to leave us, and after beſtowing upon me freſh careſſes and tokens of tenderneſs, he pulled out of his fob a moſt valuable watch, ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diamonds; "Here," ſaid he, "my Alexis, let this put you in mind of our firſt interview,"—"O heaven! what do you propoſe? I do not want ſo rich a gift."—"Take it, I ſay, think on me <hi>when the clock ſtrikes ten!"</hi>—"What do you mean?"—"Tremble to hear one day the explanation of this myſtery."</p>
               <p>With theſe words he left us, ſtruck dumb with this ſecond <hi>trait</hi> of his character; but at laſt the pleaſure
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030364_0032_0FE5D1754A748380"/>
of having found my father made me forget every thing elſe, and I only wiſhed to prove my ſubmiſſion to him, by making rapid advances in the path of knowledge under the auſpices of Mr. Dumont. It was lucky Vincent had not ſeen this ſcene; we were reſolved to conceal it from him, to prevent his making ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries to know my father, as we would not have attempted ourſelves, ſo much did we wiſh to comply with the orders he had given me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dumont was not miſtaken in having been told that I was ſo much like my father: I was indeed his very portrait, and upon recollection, I remember to have ſeen him many times next me when I went to church with Mrs. Delys. There being always a great number of people in our ſeat, I took no particular notice of him, though undoubtedly he came there on purpoſe to ſee me. Mrs. Delys did not, or feigned not to know him, for I never ſaw her ſpeak to him.</p>
               <p>The notion he had to enter my apartment in a maſk was not very fit to remove all ſuſpicions from my mind; for ſuppoſing the ſcene had not terminated as it did, it is plain I would have aſked him why he appeared before me in diſguiſe. Perhaps he then would have been much at a loſs for an anſwer; but in my confuſion I did not think of it.</p>
               <p>The valuable jewel which I had received from my father, as a preſent, was ſo fine, ſo new to me, that I ſpent the whole day in examining and making my <hi>repeater</hi> ſound; Mr. Dumont all the while chiding me for my puerile conduct, though he could not help admiring the ſize and brilliance of the diamonds, which were very large. This confirmed us more and more in the idea that my father was a great lord. When I opened the caſe to examine the work, we were much ſurpriſed to find theſe words on the back plate—THE GIFT OF LOVE, A. D. 1730. But what encreaſed our aſtoniſhment was, to ſee that the words had been ſcratched out on purpoſe, ſo that it was rather difficult to read them. I did not know what to make of it then, but Mr. Dumout drew ſome very probable inferences from it, which may probably occur to your minds, if you are pleaſed to reflect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:030364_0033_0FE5D176150FC110"/>
Winding up my watch at night, I obſerved in <hi>was ten.</hi> That very moment my father's words returned to my mind; <hi>Think on me when the clock ſtrikes ten!</hi> I felt a cold ſweat all over my body; my heart was depreſſed, I knew not why; I went to bed, my eyes ſwimming in tears. During the night, I was tormented by ominous dreams. I ſaw my father pierced with ſtabs, ſtretching out his hand to me, &amp;c. All theſe phantoms, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſuſpicions I entertained when I went to bed, vaniſhed when I awoke. I informed my tutor of them, who railed at my credulity, and wholly diſſipated my terrors. Nevertheleſs, every night when I wound up my watch, if unluckily I perceived the <hi>hour of ten,</hi> I felt an involuntary emotion which I could not account for. Theſe myſterious expreſſions of my father had indeed ſome meaning. The manner in which he dwelt upon them when he uttered them, his tone of voice, in ſhort, every thing proved it; but I never could comprehend their meaning, and am ſtill ignorant of it. Perhaps one day if I am able to unravel my adventures. I may comprehend them and the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune I have to dread.</p>
               <p>In compliance with my father's deſire, next day I hired proper maſters to teach me drawing, muſic, and dancing, and cultivated theſe arts, I may ſay, with ſome ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Three months elapſed before my father returned to ſee me. What joy did I feel when Mr. Dumont brought me the news! I flew to meet him, and preſſed him in my arms. He embraced me cloſely, called me his dear, his little Alexis; then made me repeat the leſſons I had received ſince his abſence, and was charmed with my progreſs. Every moment he would ſay—<hi>He will reſemble his mother, he will inherit all her accompliſhments.</hi> I had too much reſpect to aſk him any queſtions about his ſecret, queſtions which might have grieved him, and I ſaw with pleaſure that he judged me worthy of the care he took of my educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He made another payment of fifty louis d'ors to Mr. Dumont, requeſting him to entertain me with theatrical performances, to bring me into the world, and above all never to ſpeak of the ſecret of my birth.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030364_0034_0FE5D17BB1C6B8B8"/>
He alſo made me ſeveral uſeful and valuable preſents, for which I returned him my ſincereſt thanks. He was about to leave me, when I pulled out my watch, to tell him it was not late, and perſuaded him to ſtay a little longer; on this he took my hand, and ſaid to me, in a tender voice, "My dear ſon, you cannot think too much upon me <hi>when the clock ſtrikes ten."</hi> For this time I could hardly refrain my curioſity. I was bold enough to aſk him, what happened to him at that hour?—"I work for thee, my dear Alexis—alas, what was I going to ſay?—My ſon, I once begged of you—Let this be your laſt queſtion."</p>
               <p>I made a thouſand apologies for my imprudence. My good father forgave me, preſſed me to his heart, and promiſed to come and ſee me again in three months' time.</p>
               <p>What a ſingular character! Are you not ſurpriſed, my worthy friends, at ſo extraordinary a conduct? It ſurpriſed Mr. Dumont and me highly, but we were obliged to keep ſilence. It was enough of happineſs for me to ſee my father, and receive his tender careſſes.</p>
               <p>Five years elapſed, during which I made conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble improvement in my claſſics, and in the fine arts. My father came regularly to the college every three months, and always left us money and preſents; being himſelf an excellent ſcholar, he ſometimes would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to examine me upon the ſciences, and ſeemed always charmed with my anſwers. He would then congratulate Mr. Dumo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, and intreat him to perſevere in his zeal. He, however, never omitted exhorting him to procure me amuſement, and to introduce me to the polite world: He found in me, he ſaid, a gloomy temper, an awkward air, and little of the fine manners. My tutor promiſed to do every thing, but he performed little or nothing at all. Pleaſures and company were quite averſe to his character, and he was ſcrupulous in meddling with them. I ſhall ſoon relate the hiſtory of my ſetting out for the circles of the fine world. I have now to impart to you an odd prediction, to which I gave no credit, though it would much aſtoniſh me, were it to turn out a true one. My father had ſo often told me to think on him <hi>when the clock ſtruck ten,</hi> that one day I was reſolved to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030364_0035_0FE5D17D12688A28"/>
try to find out, if poſſible, the ſenſe of this enigma.</p>
               <p>There was at the college gate a poor beggar, about forty years of age, all in rags, but with a handſome face, who paſſed for a conjurer. All the ſtudents had conſulted him, and all had left him, ſurpriſed at his talents of divining the paſt, and foretelling the future. The maſter of the college had ordered him to be driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away twenty times, but he always returned, and found a livelihood in the preſents made to him by the curious. While Mr. Dumont was walking one day in the yard with ſome of the profeſſors, I ſeized this occaſion to bring the pauper into my room. The great iron gate was open; and the porter, buſy with ſomething or other, had not ſeen him come in; every thing crowned my wiſhes.</p>
               <p>Having cloſeted myſelf with him, I began to aſk him, "what countryman are you?"—"From Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen Breſſe."—"What buſineſs did you follow?"—"A very dangerous and ungrateful one, that of a ſoldier."—"Have you ſerved?"—"Yes, and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, my good gentleman; I have here eight wounds, which will prove it."—"And you muſt now go a begging?"—"Why, it is not the man who fights for his country that grows rich; it is he that keeps it down."—"Very true."—"Don't you ſee that the little ones have the greateſt trouble, and the great earn the largeſt benefits."—"Thou art a clever, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious fellow."—"Good ſenſe is a gift of nature, and judgment the reſult of experience."—"Very good! pray how did you learn to tell fortunes?"—"This is our buſineſs in garriſons; there we find people who have been all over the world, who have ſeen all nations on earth, and one picks up inſtruction by another."—"Well, a perſon dear to me, when he gave me this watch, ſaid, and has repeated the ſame words ſince, <hi>Think on me when the clock ſtrikes ten!</hi> Could you now tell me what he does at that hour?"—"To be ſure, my kind gentleman; lend me this jewel."</p>
               <p>"I truſted the watch into his hands. He ſuddenly began to be penſive, to write, to make calculations, and at the expiration of one hour, with a prophetic voice, which upon any other occaſion would have made me laugh, ſaid to me, "This watch you have
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030364_0036_0FE5D17DDCD6B0C0"/>
received from a man, who received it from a woman, and that man is in confinement every night at ten o'clock, in a priſon, which he does not quit till next morning."</p>
               <p>Though ſimilar divinations received no great belief from me, I could not help trembling at theſe dreadful words; and ſuch was my rage that I was very near ill treating the beggar, for having pronounced a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſo unwelcome to me. I compoſed myſelf, however, and entreated him to diſcover how he had been able to gueſs that? The man, anxious to find an opportunity of making a brilliant diſplay of his knowledge, made the following harangue:</p>
               <p>"To us every thing is cabaliſtical: A watch, a pocket book, a ring, every thing has ſigns which are always the ſame, and upon which we lay various and different conſtructions, according to the circumſtances. A watch is the ſymbol of life. <hi>One o'clock</hi> is the inſtant of birth, and always implies blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſuffering, joy mixed with pains, inſenſibility, fickleneſs, &amp;c. <hi>Two o'clock</hi> marks the age of ſix. It is careleſſneſs, levity, caprice, contempt of the great, oblivion of troubles, and content. <hi>Three o'clock</hi> refers to the age of nine. It means thinking, troubles, tears, uneaſineſs, labor, &amp;c. I could thus explain all the hours, one after another, but I ſhould confine myſelf to the ſign of <hi>ten o'clock,</hi> which is the age of three ſcore and three. It ſignifies heavineſs, ice, priſon, fetters, &amp;c. Or, every hour has another wherewith it forms a contraſt. The oppoſite to <hi>ten</hi> is <hi>ſix,</hi> which is the age of eighteen, the age when we break the bands of childhood, and where the paſſions appear with impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity. That ſignifies elopement, delivery, tranſitory happineſs, lively pleaſure, but of ſhort duration, and poiſoned by remorſe or the fear of futurity.</p>
               <p>"From this explanation, you may collect, that had you known my ſecret, you would have gueſſed this enigma as well as myſelf. Divide the hours into three years each, and thus proceed to midnight, which is the period, or <hi>death.</hi> Make them refer to the moral actions of every epoch of life, and you will gueſs all. Your man is in affliction at ten at night: I mean, he
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030364_0037_0FE5D17EA4992BD0"/>
is reſtrained, fettered, impriſoned: And as every criſis has a period, and every hour a contraſt, thus he leaves his confinement at ſix in the morning."</p>
               <p>I could not help laughing at this ſtrange fuſtian of my prophet, and ſeeing me ſo merry, he was on the point of being angry, and would give me another ſpecimen of his abilities. He made ſome grimaces, examined my hands, my eyes, my features, and finiſhed with telling me, that I ſhould one day become very rich, very powerful, very happy, &amp;c. that I ſhould be married to a fine woman whom I had loved a very long time, but that all this was not to come to paſs before I had undergone a great deal of adverſity.—"Well, my friend," anſwered I, "I receive your prediction; go, and if ever I am happy, thou ſhalt be happy too."—"You think I am in joke," purſued the diviner, "but be ſure if I am ſo fortunate as to diſcover the truth of my augury, you ſhall ſee me at your door."</p>
               <p>I ſent him away laughing, and upbraiding myſelf for my fooliſh curioſity.</p>

               <p>IN the mean time I grew up, and every day added ſomething to my accompliſhments; but of what uſe were they to me? Muſic, in which I was a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adept, far from having thoſe charms which every other perſon finds in it tired and wearied me. I had no opportunity to diſplay it. I went to no concert, not even to a play, and was reduced to ſing ſuch ſolitary airs as Mr. Dumont choſe to place before me.</p>
               <p>He painted ſociety in ſuch odious colours, that I was far from begging him to introduce me any where; our ſole amuſement was to walk in the country. We always reaped ſome advantage from theſe excurſions; nothing to us was an object of indifference, and we
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030364_0038_0FE5D1802BBB30C0"/>
made comments upon every little incident that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf.</p>
               <p>One day we returned from Belleville, by a path leading through the fields; the ſun was ſunk beneath the horizon, and the diſk of the moon proclaimed the empire of night. We perceived a young man behind a buſh at ſome diſtance from our path, ſighing and uttering ſuch loud complaints as reached our ears. We could plainly ſee him hold a piſtol, which he loaded with apparent haſte, and applied it repeatedly to his mouth. At firſt we were apprehenſive for ourſelves, but finding that the ſtranger did not perceive us, and was apparently ſtruggling in deep deſpair, we yielded to compaſſion. We approached the hedge ſlowly, and could hear him utter theſe words, in a diſtracted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with a low voice, interrupted with ſighs—"Let me finiſh! Let this moment terminate my ſufferings! I have loſt my all! Death is but a ſlumber, I will ſleep then, and ſuffer no more."</p>
               <p>Theſe expreſſions rouſed the indignation of my Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: He plainly ſaw that the man was a materialiſt, and he deteſted that impious ſect. Yet pity, and a deſire of reclaiming him to reaſon, determined him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his error, if poſſible, and ſave his life. "Ah! ſir, what are you doing?" cried he, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf; can you entertain ſo bad an opinion of yourſelf and of the Being that made you?"</p>
               <p>The ſtranger, ſurpriſed at the ſudden apparition of a prieſt and a young man, was ſtruck, but compoſing himſelf, anſwered Mr. Dumont—"What is my way of thinking to you? Are you, ſir, to anſwer for me? Let us be ſhort, I have no time to diſpute with you, I muſt get rid of my life, I muſt." "What prompts you to ſo raſh a deed?"—Every thing; diſtreſs and a total want of reſources."—"At your age do you deſpair of providence."—"Mere words."—"Very efficacious words. But what impels you to a deed ſo unworthy of a man of courage? Your exterior ſhows that it is not diſtreſs?"—"It is nothing elſe, I aſſure you."—"Young man, be calm, diſcloſe your heart. My profeſſion ſhall be the pledge of my diſcretion and probity. Relate your misfortunes."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:030364_0039_0FE5D183CCAB06D8"/>
"What can it avail?"—"I may, perhaps, be of ſome ſervice to you; hear me, you are unfortunate, I have been the ſame, and the boy whom you ſee here has been unfortunate, and his ſituation perhaps is worſe than yours! Come, my dear friend, give me the piſtol, and take my hand: Sit down by your two friends upon this riſing turf! I am concerned for you; how happy ſhould I be if I could—but—this is the murdering weapon. Away with the inſtrument of celeſtial wrath, I will have you to live."</p>
               <p>Dumont, with this, threw away the piſtol which the young man had given him, and both ſat down on the turf: I followed them ſhivering, and within myſelf taxed my preceptor with imprudence. Acquainted as I was with his miſtruſtful diſpoſition, he now ſurpriſed me, and his humanity alone pleaded for him."</p>
               <p>The ſtranger related a ſeries of adverſe incidents, which I ſhall not recapitulate, and concluded, that having been ſecretary to one count D'Ereville, he had been diſmiſſed in a diſgraceful way through the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of a friend, and was of courſe without ſhelter or reſources. Mr. Dumont, quite moved at his ſtory, conſoled him, made a tender of his ſervices, and gave him from his purſe a louis d'or. The ſtranger thanked him in the warmeſt manner. This gratitude touched me, and I was preparing to beſtow the ſame favor upon him: But, judge my ſurpriſe! At the ſight of the gold, which ſeemed to dazzle his eyes, the villain turned quite pale, and in the rudeſt manner cried, "What, do you confine your liberality to ſo trifling a gift? Why, have you not more money? I inſiſt upon having all."—"O heavens, thou wretch!"—"I am a wretch, and capable of—this inſtant give me what you have, or your life!"</p>
               <p>Fear, ſurpriſe, and indignation overwhelmed our ſenſes. We roſe and looked around, if any perſon could aſſiſt us; but the darkneſs of the place prevented our ſeeing any thing, and we were defenceleſs. The wretch produced another piſtol, which he had no doubt provided for the purpoſe. What a ſituation was ours! After having loaded him with reproaches we conſented to give him our all, but the ruffian ſeeing our watch
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030364_0040_0FE5D18635106578"/>
chains demanded them alſo. Mine was too dear for me to conſent to loſe it. This enraged me, I pulled out my knife, and ſtepping backwards, "Traitor!" cried I, "thou ſhalt not have it, without my life." Mr. Dumont, encouraged by my behaviour, ruſhed upon the robber, wreſted from his hands the piſtol with which he threatened to blow out my brains. But I know not how the matter would have ended, but for the unforeseen aſſiſtance which heaven ſent us in that extremity. A waggoner's whip, and the diſtant rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of a carriage ſuddenly ſtruck our ears. This, which revived hope in our breaſts, gave ſuch terror and diſmay to our enemy, that he flew from us acroſs the plain, and thus delivered us from the danger we were in.</p>
               <p>We now looked at one another for ſome time unable to utter a word; and in this ſituation the waggoner found us. He looked at us, and, frightened at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight of the piſtol which Mr. Dumont ſtill held in his hand, aſked us what we were doing? "Ah, my friend," cried my tutor, "to you we owe our lives; a wretch had juſt robbed us; I was ſtrong enough to attack him and he made off on your approach." The waggoner aſked for the piſtol, and endeavored to fire it in the air, but to the ſurpriſe of us all it was <hi>not</hi> loaded. We then told him our adventure, and entreated his company and protection until we ſhould reach the <hi>porte St. Antoine.</hi> This he readily complied with, and we ſet out together, but not without a mixture of uneaſineſs; for we were ſo diſconcerted by the treachery of the ſtranger, as every now and then to look around us, believing him at our heels.</p>
               <p>Having reached the <hi>port St. Antoine,</hi> we had it not in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When arrived at the college, Dumont ſaid, "What a leſſon! what a ſad leſſon, my dear diſciple! Such are men! Such are thoſe traitors, thoſe monſters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; they plunge a dagger in your breaſt the very moment you give them aſſiſtance. After ſuch conduct,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030364_0041_0FE5D1870C0D7EB8"/>
oblige them! be humane, feeling, generous! You ſee how they acknowledge our kindneſs!"—"But, ſir, are they all of that diſpoſition"—"All, my dear youth; they do not poſitively attack you, piſtol in hand, as this ruffian has done, but they will ſlander you, they will aſperſe your character, and defame you privately. One will without pity aſſaſſinate you in one ſenſe. This has no principle, no character, and of courſe no grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. That is all warmth, all zeal, all heart: But by due inference, he has paſſions which will break the tie that unites them to you.</p>
               <p>"There are ſome who love you ſincerely, who profeſs a real attachment to your intereſt; with your friends they are your friends, but with your enemies they will act as enemies. In company with the latter, they, by a motive of zeal will defend you, but they gradually yield, and at length grant all that your enemies have to ſay againſt you.</p>
               <p>"Such is the return for obligations conferred. I am, however, of opinion, that the generous heart ſhould not be diſmayed, if it meets with ingratitude; and ſhould make an effort of noble perſeverance, and be an its guard. As for my own part I ought not to have confided in the traitor who has thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

I ought to have foreſeen his villainy, for men without religion are not ſuſceptible of virtuous ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."—"The piſtol with which he threatened us was, however, not loaded: He ſurely muſt have known that; it muſt have been the ſight of our gold alone that made him break through all bounds,"</p>
               <p>"This is another fatal vice: The ſordid paſſion hatched in an abject, indelicate heart."—"But, ſir, extreme want? may it not ſometimes—"—"Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme want! No, my dear friend, never. An honeſt man ſuffers, ſighs, and is ſatisfied with the caſual relief afforded by humanity and generoſity. We may alſo ſpeak of ſociety in regard to this vice. Be you ever ſo rich, ever ſo liberal to the indigent who ſurround you they are never ſatisfied. They will have you to ſtrip yourſelf to ſerve them, or at leaſt wiſh to be your equal. Covetouſneſs, ambition and avarice prey upon them; they become inſatiable by freſh favors confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

You can ſcarcely expect from them the leaſt gratitude."</p>
               <p>All the advice given me by Mr. Dumont, was, like this, wiſe and tempered by reflection. It crept into my mind and ſtrengthened my reſolution of ſhunning all mankind, whom I conſidered in the worſt poſſible light.</p>
               <p>Here Alexis ſuſpended his narrative in order to partake of the nouriſhment ſo much wanted by the three travellers. Clara ſerved up ſome boiled vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, fruit, and a little milk, and the four ſat down to a meal which health and appetite rendered exquiſite. When the meal was over Candor begged his young gueſt to proceed with his ſtory, which ſeemed great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y to intereſt him. They all reſumed their former places, and Alexis, after ſignifying that his adventures were drawing to a concluſion, continued with ſuch a grace and winning addreſs, as totally conquered the hearts of thoſe who made him ſo kindly welcome.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dumont conceived a project which he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to me. He was determined to obtain every particular reſpecting the character of the man who frightened us in the plains of Belleville; and his end for doing it, he ſaid, was to illuſtrate the better by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the moral leſſons he had given me.</p>
               <p>The ſtranger, in relating his hiſtory, had diſcovered that he had been formerly ſecretary to count Ereville. This count had then his ſon at college, and of all my fellow ſtudents, the young count was the only one with whom I was intimate. I remarked in him no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial qualities, but he appeared leſs degenerate than the reſt. As I was a proficient in muſic, he had repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly invited me to his father's houſe to hear his ſiſter, who, he ſaid, was a capital performer on the piano forte. Mr. Dumont, feeling averſe to my going into company, had always rejected the polite offer of my young friend, but curious to dive into our adventure at Belleville, he finally yielded to young Ereville's ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations, and we engaged ourſelves for the firſt holiday: I took with me ſome pieces of muſic, and with Mr. Dumont ſet out from the college.</p>
               <p>It was about four o'clock when we arrived at the count's houſe. The ſervant gave in our names, and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030364_0043_0FE5D19019C3FE38"/>
introduced us to a hall ſumptuouſly furniſhed, where, in a circle of eight or ten cavaliers, we found it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to diſtinguiſh the maſter of the houſe. The young count, however, preſented us to his father and mother, and the reception they gave us was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flattering. Soon after my friend having informed them that I was a performer, they expreſſed a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to hear me. I objected for ſome time, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miſs D'Ereville to give us a diſplay of her tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, but as ſhe refuſed I was obliged to comply. I ſat down and ſung to my own accompaniment a kind of ſong, the words and muſic of which I had compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. At the end of my ſong, the whole company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on me ſuch compliments as I certainly did not deſerve, and begged for a copy of my ſong, which I promiſed. Miſs D'Ereville, in her turn, performed, with a moſt ungraceful air, a ſonata of my maſter's compoſition, which the badneſs of her performance could hardly make me diſtinguiſh. Notwithſtanding, the whole company clapped their hands, feigned great rapture, and beſtowed the moſt exaggerated praiſe on Miſs D'Ereville; the little creature received them with an air of ſelf ſufficiency, always preceeding from thoſe vain and high notions which people conceive of their own merit.</p>
               <p>The inſtruments were now laid aſide, the viſitors formed a circle, and the converſation became general. "Is it not long," madame D'Ereville aſked a young officer, with a mean and haughty countenance, "Is it not long ſince you have ſeen the chevalier D'A***?" "Long indeed," anſwered the officer, "I do not know what becomes of him. He forſakes all his friends, which is ſhameful." "Love decoys him from the boſom of friendſhip," replied a perſon who appeared the preſident of the circle. "Well," anſwered a luſty abbé, "has he left his <hi>fille D'Opera?"</hi> "O no!" continues an old baroneſs, quite loaded with diamonds: "they live ſtill together,. Is it not a moſt degenerate taſte? He ſhould at leaſt have paid his addreſſes to ſome woman of quality."—"By the bye," ſays the abbè "he is fit for the beſt company. "We know him better," anſwered the officer.—"How do you make that out?" aſked
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030364_0044_0FE5D190E8748D58"/>
madame D'Ereville. "How, do you <hi>not</hi> know it," "No, I don't, pray tell me."—"He is a baſtard, he is, indeed, he is the ſon of count D'A*** and a woman whoſe name has never been known."—"What, are you ſure of this, abbé?"—"Very ſure, he imparted it in confidence to me."—"How then came he by the title of chevalier?"—O! his is a title one may eaſily take." "Softly, abbè" replied the ſparkling baroneſs, "he is legitimated, his father took care of that."—"He ſays ſo, perhaps."—"O! this is very true, I have been intimate for ſix months with the chevalier D'A *** and have ſeen his diploma more than once."—"Why, diplomas may be now got eaſily."—I cannot believe it, purſued madame D'Ereville! "The chevalier a baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard! how could ſuch a man be admitted into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany! "Never mind that," anſwered the Dowager, "the ladies like him."—"To be ſure," anſwered the counteſs, with a malicious ſneer, "Thoſe ladies that are plenty,"—"Why, he makes his choice: that is ſomething, however."—"He does not take the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt."—"Oh, ſaid the preſident, with a bitter ſmile, "He always takes care that Plutus indemnifies him for the ill favor of nature." At this vulgar <hi>bon mot,</hi> the whole company burſt into laughter. The baroneſs only ſeemed to be enraged, ſhe roſe, ſaluted the company, and departed. One after another left the room in the ſame manner, and ill natured reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were paſſed at the expenſe of every one of them.</p>
               <p>We carried away from this houſe ample matter for reflection, and began to philoſophize as ſoon as we reached the college.</p>
               <p>"My dear diſciple" ſaid Mr. Dumont, "you have now ſeen company, and how do you like it?—"It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo odious to me that I never wiſh to ſee it again." "I ſhall forbear adviſing you on that head. The example which chance has furniſhed you with, ought to make a ſufficient impreſſion upon your mind. I ſhall only reflect upon the conduct of the young man, who uſed us ſo perfidiouſly on the road to Belville, what do you think of him?" When I gave him my opinion, he added a number of reflections on the ſubject, and adviſed me againſt keeping company with young D' Ereville, of whom he had reaſons now to form a very bad opinion.</p>

               <p>THUS the ſage leſſons of my maſter took firm root in my heart, and I, no doubt for my welfare, acquired a reſerved gloomy temper, which gave him the higheſt ſatisfaction. He conceived ſo ſtrong an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment for me, as to promiſe to be for life the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his dear Alexis, if irreſiſtable fate ſhould not diſpoſe otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>My father came to ſee us regularly every three months, and let us want for nothing. Mrs. Delys died ſeveral years before: I gave tears to her memory, but at laſt regretted her no farther than a reſpectable friend, who had ſerved me as a mother in my infancy.</p>
               <p>I was as happy as man can be, and hoped to enjoy my good fortune much longer, when fate, jealous of my peaceful days, begun the ſeries of my misfortunes, by an event whoſe conſequences ſeemed at firſt leſs ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to me, than they really proved afterwards.</p>
               <p>I was fifteen, and had ſoon to ſtudy philoſophy, when one day Mr. Dumont received a note, which, to my terror, he read to me:</p>

                  </gap> Mr. Dumont? He had no acquaintance. Who could be the writer of the note? What could be the urgent buſineſs to be communicated to him? Was it my father, who—but he could come himſelf! What uneaſineſs! What cruel perplexity!</p>
               <p>We waited with the greateſt impatience for the end of the day, and although the unknown perſon required Mr. Dumont to come by himſelf, I begged the latter to permit me to accompany him, promiſing, to walk

upon the terrace during the time of their interview<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he was ſo delicate, ſo ſcrupulous, that he could not conſent to my propoſal. In conſequence, I let him depart, and waited for his return, in an agitation which I could not ſuppreſs, and like a man that waits for his doom.</p>
               <p>He returned about nine o'clock, and the change I perceived in his countenance made me utter a pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cry. The tears he endeavored to withhold rolled down his eyes, whoſe redneſs indicated that he had ſhed more; his voice was altered, he fixed his eyes upon me with an emotion of tenderneſs, was going to ſpeak, but his tongue denied its office, and he could only preſs me in his arms. "Well, ſir," ſaid I, "what tidings do you bring for me." "None that will vex you," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, ſtriving to conceal his grief. "Be of good cheer, if I ſhed tears, it is only becauſe your father is abſent, and we muſt miſs him for ſome time." "What, my father?"—"It was he; I have ſeen him! Mr. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, ſaid he, I am obliged to go upon a very long journey—take care of my poor Alexis! I entruſt him to you: Reſtore him to me at my return. Let me find him prudent, modeſt, clever, and grateful! I ſet out, I tell you, upon a journey that will laſt perhaps—I cannot fix the period. I ſhall provide for you and him, but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And here your father could go no farther; he gave me this large ſum, and departed, recommending me the precious depoſit with which he entrusted me."</p>
               <p>Thus ſpoke Mr. Dumont, and I could not perceive in his countenance that air of aſſurance ſo peculiar to him, which was always a ſure token of truth. "You deceive me," ſaid I, "my dear preceptor, you conceal my misfortune! My father abandons me forever!"—"There again, always extreme, and never confiding, a characteriſtic trait of yours! Why ſhould he abandon you, have you deſerved it?—Alas!—Well, my Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, believe a friend who ſpeaks to you, a friend who cheriſhes and will never ſuffer to be parted from you—no—never!"</p>

                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:030364_0047_0FE5D1995DC7EAA8"/>
He uttered theſe laſt words with ſuch an emotion of ſenſibility, that I threw myſelf into his arms, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed his breaſt with my tears. I could however ſee, that he hid ſomething from me, but I would impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune him no farther, perſuaded that all his views tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my happineſs, and it required powerful motives to make him feign.</p>
               <p>The very next day we left the college, which I quitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without regret, and rented an apartment in a houſe near the royal botanical garden. That lodging was neither fine nor convenient; and Mr. Dumont obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we ought to be frugal, as my father, when at a diſtance, would not always find ſuch eaſy means to ſend us remittances. I aſked if he had promiſed to write. No doubt, anſwered he, can a father deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that comfort?</p>
               <p>Mr. Dumont ſeemed always to diſſemble, while my uneaſineſs became greater ſtill. Nevertheleſs I kept ſilence, and was determined to yield to the power of fate.</p>
               <p>From that very inſtant we changed our way of living: Vincent got his diſcharge, and we hired a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſervant who was to look after our domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and to dreſs our victuals. I alſo paid off and thanked my maſter; ſo great, in ſhort, was the change, that I firmly believed my father had abandoned me. I made often this obſervation to Mr. Dumont, who would then be angry, and always ſhewed me certain ſums of money, which he ſaid were brought him by ſome unknown perſon</p>
               <p>This a whole year elapſed, during which I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſtudies under Mr. Dumont, who was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſcholar. I begun to be a little eaſier; I had the ſame occupation and the ſame pleaſures as before; that is to ſay, we took frequent wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The little wood in the centre and the marſhes which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs the walls, reaching as far as the river, gave it ſuch a rural and ſolitary aſpect, as made it, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the fineſt garden in Paris.</p>
               <p>During the ſecond year of our reſidence in the ſame lodgings, Mr. Dumont began to cauſe me a moſt cruel

uneaſineſs. He went out for the whole day, and only came to ſee me at meal hours, and at night, which time he employed to correct my exerciſes. He ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued tender and friendly, but his confidence and aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity were much leſſened; for my own part, I did not know where he went, as he ſeemed to make it a myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, I dared not to venture the leaſt queſtion.</p>
               <p>I perceived that his means were very low, that our domeſtic parſimony augmented, and that our expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diminiſhed from day to day. I was very well dreſſed, when his clothes were in a ſhabby condition, and he almoſt denied himſelf the common neceſſaries. I received no intelligence from my father. All this threw me into a ſtate of langour, which brought on a very ſerious malady, of which I had like to have died.</p>
               <p>It was then I had an opportunity to ſee all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and attachment Mr. Dumont profeſſed for me: He would not leave the room, for a minute, and sat up by me night and day, for the long ſpace of three weeks, during which my illneſs laſted. How often did I entreat him to explain himſelf! He always anſwered I was much in the wrong, for creating myſelf a chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erical miſery. All affairs had taken a much better turn; in ſhort, I was upon the point of receiving a letter from my father; his wiſe counſels, his conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inſtilled, as it were, a precious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> into my ſenſes, and I recovered completely.</p>
               <p>I was ſcarcely out of danger, but he continued his late odd way of living. He even became leſs ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and at laſt I miſſed him for whole days together. In order to encreaſe my alarm, the ſervant maid thought to ingratiate herſelf with me, by informing me that my preceptor left the houſe regularly every night, that as ſoon as he ſaw me aſleep he would riſe, and leave the houſe and not return until five in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then go to bed.</p>
               <p>Matters being come to ſuch a criſis, I could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er forbear my inquietude, and one day determined to bring him to an account for a conduct, as unnatural as irregular. Having fixed a day to make the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſo delicate an affair, I waited for his return, when the ſame ſervant came to me, quite frightened, and addreſſed me in theſe dreadful words: "Ah!—
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030364_0049_0FE5D19AF0F9BC28"/>
ſir!—your preceptor!—pray run after him!—he has been arreſted—he is in priſon!"—"Heaven! and what has he done?"—"I don't know, people ſay it is for debt."—"For debt! ah, my God!"</p>
               <p>I haſtily waited upon the commiſſaire, or juſtice of the diſtrict, and by him was informed, that the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Dumont had been dragged into a black dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon for a note of hand of <hi>five louis d'ors,</hi> which he had not been able to pay.</p>
               <p>Judge of my grief at theſe ſad tidings. I went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the priſon, and requeſted the jailor to open the dungeon in which my friend had been thrown, perhaps for my own ſake.</p>
               <p>What felt I at this ſight! pale, bewildered, ſtretched over a mat, with no other light than that of a ſmall ſpiracle!—O God! I cannot retrace the picture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror.</p>
               <p>I flew to his arms, and we mixed our tears—"Well," ſaid I, ſobbing, "cruel man, I ſee at laſt the fatal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret unravelled! We have loſt all aſſiſtance, and you have involved yourſelf in ruin for me!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! my worthy Alexis," exclaimed he, claſping me in his arms, "I endeavored to conceal it long; but adverſe fate has baffled my deſign. I will have you hear, and know the whole affair, but your lot is more to be pitied than mine.</p>
               <p>The day I received the anonymous note, I repaired to the garden of Luxembourg, to the appointed ſpot. I had no ſooner arrived, than a man, in great haſte, came up to me. I knew him, it was your father; Mr. Dumont, ſaid he, in a time of grief, it is all over!—I am forced to it—I muſt abandon him." "Whom. ſir, that child, yoor ſon?"—"He is not my ſon! he cauſes all my misfortunes, and thoſe of the moſt amiable, and moſt perfidious woman! In ſhort, I will ſee him no more, neither ought, nor can I!

ſir," cried I, proſtrating myſelf, "can you be ſo hard hearted? Unfortunate boy!—Will you then have him die? He will die, he will ſurely die! Be his father, for he deems it his happineſs to be your ſon!—Aſſiſt him—protect him.—Alas!—he is ſo amiable, ſo virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous!—Ah, ſir, I embrace your knees, I bedew them with my tears; liſten to compaſſion, to tenderneſs, and ſtifle not in your heart the cries of nature!"—"Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, you touch me, but I cannot—he is not my ſon! Did you but know!—Oh! how I am to be pitied! Farewel! Let him take care of his life, and do you the ſame; for my deſtiny is ſo dreadful as to make me the ruin of all thoſe who come near me!"</p>
               <p>Theſe words made me ſhudder; I was going to anſwer; but he quickly put a purſe into my hand, and vaniſhed like a flaſh of lightning.</p>
               <p>Judge of my aſtoniſhment and grief. I ruminated moſt ſeriouſly upon what reſolution I ſhould take, and determined to conceal this cruel event, and live with you as long as poſſible, on the ſavings of your father's kindneſs, and the fruits of my own induſtry. Fifty louis d'ors contained in the purſe, and nearly that ſum which we had ſaved, helped me to pay your quarter at college, to rent an apartment, to furniſh it decently. I diſcharged Vincent, hired a maid, and prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to pay off and quit your maſters. Alas! in ſpite of all my parſimony, I found that, after a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month, I could only command twelve louis d'ors.</p>
               <p>Foreſeeing that we ſhould ſoon be reduced to want, I reſolved to give leſſons in town, in writing and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin; but of what ſervice could it be? I had but a few pupils, and even thoſe did not pay me! When you are on the brink of an abyſs, every one takes delight in puſhing you into it. Your diſorder and the care which it demanded of me, made me loſe all my ſcholars, and I was obliged to borrow the ſum of five louis d'ors, which I obtained upon my note of hand; ſince that time I had done all in my power to diſcharge that obligation, but the neceſſity of a ſubſiſtence, hindred me from accompliſhing my good purpoſe. I was, however, more induſtrious than before, for I worked night and day at a printer's, but earned ſo little, as would hardly fetch the common neceſſaries of life and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030364_0051_0FE5D1A3CFC9E2A8"/>
hinder you from being aware of my miſerable condition.</p>
               <p>Now, my amiable Alexis, now I am deprived of liberty for a long time to come, what will become of you? Who is to take care of you? Who is to give you bread? Oh, lovely child, who has neither parents nor friends in this world, what will become of you?"</p>
               <p>"O thou moſt worthy pattern of friendſhip," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed I. "O thou boaſt of men! do you think I ſhall ſuffer you to remain in irons, with which I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have loaded the beſt of friends?—No, think not that I ſhall have recourſe to the vain pity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind! I am humbled by their generoſity; and their favors, courted by baſeneſs, would make me bluſh. Still, I have one reſource left, a dear, a precious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, but it will become ſtill dearer and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as it is to atone for the injuries I have done to you.—O my worthy tutor, I ſhall only quit you, to return and take you from this abode of horror."</p>
               <p>Dumont, who underſtood that I meant the gold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peater enriched with diamonds, which my father had given me, ſtrove though in vain, to detain me. I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to a watchmaker's, who after much talk, paid me twenty-five louis d'ors for a watch, that ought to have fetched twice that ſum, and I came back to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my friend's debt, and to break his irons! Think of the joy I felt when we returned to our apartment! I was almoſt out of my ſenſes; I took Dumont in my arms, and thanked heaven for the reſource it left me in ſuch an exigency.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs my joy was followed by uneaſineſs, there was left no more than fifteen louis d'ors. What could we do with a ſum ſo moderate? How could we ſubſiſt much longer? My Dumont would not make me any propoſal to work, for fear of hurting my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. I was ſenſible of his generous reſerve. I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to him my having conceived a project of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſic in town, which he ſealed with his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Muſic, ſaid he, is an art one may teach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out derogating; but my dear Alexis, how unpleaſant will you find it! you muſt prepare to put up with the caprice, haughtineſs, and ill humors of a thouſand

people, who, deſtitute of every ſhadow of genius or parts, always blame their maſters for their own ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity: Since they pay, they fancy that ſcience and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity muſt be acquired without either trouble or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Often they will tell you: But, ſir, I have now learned ſo many months, and know nothing, while Mrs. N—is already a complete muſician!—It will be in vain for you to tell them Mrs. N—has ſtuck cloſer to the art, and that her utmoſt attention and docility have been always concerted to do honor to the leſſons of her maſter. Ah! my Alexis, what a patience, what a politeneſs, what a gentleneſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thoſe who are deſirous of inſtructing mankind in what ſcience or art ſoever! I pity you for being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to recur to a ſimilar expedient; but ſtill, it is decent, genteel, and not unworthy of your education, make therefore the beſt uſe of it you can.</p>
               <p>I promiſed to profit by his leſſons, and we looked out on all ſides for pupils; but our ſearches were fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; we both had not the leaſt acquaintance; we had always avoided ſociety, and it was in the boſom of it alone, we could have found the object of our eager purſuit.</p>
               <p>Our money being gone, we ſaw ourſelves brought to the moſt dreadful miſery. It was then, the moſt ſad and diſtraſting ideas ſeized our mind. Death ſeemed to be the only remedy to our ills, we called it loudly, and it would finally have come to relieve us, had not a cruel event extricated us from our forlorn condition to plunge us in a ſtate, a thouſand times more deplorable.</p>
               <p>In one of our morning walks in the royal botanical garden, a venerable grey head ruſhed by us, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a young man of about thirty, in whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance were painted gloomineſs and ſorrow. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſt his eyes on me, and exclaimed with an irre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He ſhall periſh."</p>
               <p>Hereupon the two ſtrangers leſt us quite ſtupified at

this adventure, and ſo ſingular a retreat. "Dear Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont," exclaimed I, ſhedding a torrent of tears, "I am loſt, now my fate is determinated!" "Softly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis, deſpair not, my dear child; aſtoniſhing as this adventure is, it ought not to alarm you ſo much; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not be killed in that manner. Never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"But ſir what have I done to thoſe cruel men? O heaven! who will apprize me of my crimes?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dumont was as much terrified as I. Theſe ſtrangers muſt therefore, have been ſome ſecret ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who have conſpired my ruin. It was from them I was to hide myſelf, but why? What a cruel enigma.</p>
               <p>We went home, where Mr. Dumont was of opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion that it would be neceſſary to decamp immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from our lodgings, leſt we ſhould be diſcovered: But there was one difficulty: We had neither money nor means to procure us wherewithal to pay our rent. Only judge of our anxiety.</p>
               <p>We ſpent the day in deadly fright; we projected twenty different expedients, rejected them ſucceſſively, and night ſurprized us without having taken any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>About midnight we heard ſeveral hard knocks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſtreet door: how our hearts beat then!—I fell ſenſeleſs in Mr. Dumont's arms who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no leſs afraid. A lodger opened the ſtreet-door, and informed us through the key hole of our apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we were wanted.</p>
               <p>Shall we open? ſhall we anſwer? What is to be done? At laſt Dumout ſhews a noble reſoluteneſs, and is determined either to ſtand or fall in my cauſe, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny violence ſhould be offered to me. He opens to let in the ſtranger: It was a ſervant, who, in a humble and reſpectful manner, begged us to be of good cheer, and ſaid to us in a whiſper: Quick, gentlemen, peruſe this, and follow me.</p>
               <p>O happineſs! O unexpected favor! It is my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, I know his hand writing.</p>
               <p>"Imprudent Alexis! your father is ſtill inclined to ſave your life, perhaps at this very moment you have

diſpoſed of his own. Follow this ſturdy ſervant!—Come, you will find me at Valence; and you, Mr. Dumont, leave not your pupil: I am in great want of you.</p>
               <p>"A way with ſcruples, depart inſtantly, or you are both undone."</p>
               <p>This was no ſnare; we plainly knew my father's writing.—"Whether ſhall we," aſked I of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.—"You ſhall ſoon ſee, only follow me."</p>
               <p>This man having delivered a conſiderable ſum with his meſſage, we paid our landlord, and ſet out that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment; a poſt chaiſe was waiting for us at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance, we got into it, and took the road to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>Judge of the thoughts which revolved in our minds! My father waited for us at Valence. We were going to ſee him again: His letter denoted either anger or hatred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Complete happineſs ſparkled in our eyes;—what a change, what a good fortune! But what could he mean by the epithet <hi>imprudent?</hi> He ſaid I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps juſt been diſpoſing of his own life. Alas! if I did, how can he accuſe me?</p>
               <p>This was the uneaſineſs which perplexed us all the way to Valence. We were ſuſpended between fear and hope. Our guide was ſilent, nor could we get from him the leaſt idea of what we wanted to know.</p>
               <p>We reached the city of Valence about eight o'clock in the evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after a journey of three days. Our guide conducted us to a fine inn, where he inquired whether or not a gentleman of ſuch a diſcription was arrived. A poſt boy then preſent, anſwered in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, adding, that, to all appearance, it was the ſame gentleman whom he had left at Lyons, and as he could be but one poſt farther, he would arrive either that night or in the morning.</p>
               <p>Hearing this we reſolved to go to ſupper, and then reſt ourſelves, till Aurora ſhould return with my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and crown all my wiſhes. I don't know what a happy preſentment agitated our breaſts. My. Dumont embraced me, and took me in his arms, ſaying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, "Courage, my Alexis, we ſhall ſee him again." What a ſeducing picture offered itſelf to my ſenſes,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030364_0055_0FE5D1B596078AA8"/>
"We ſhall be all one heart, one family! O my Alexis, receive my moſt ſacred oath, I will never abandon you. Grant me always your confidence; and may I be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortunate to deſerve that of your father."</p>
               <p>I preſſed him to my heart without giving any anſwer. Such were the flattering images which amuſed us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til four o'clock in the morning, when the ſudden rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of a poſt chaiſe, which ſtopped before the inn, rouſed us from our ſweet reverie.</p>
               <p>"It is he," exclaimed I, and we both ran down ſtairs to receive him; but O ſurpriſe! the moment I wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his arms, my father—O heaven! my father frowns at me moſt terribly, puſhes me from him, bids us walk up ſtairs to a remote apartment of the houſe, and addreſſed me with the following horrible ſpeech, which ſhall remain in my memory, to the laſt breath of my wretched being.</p>
               <p>"You are not my ſon, ſir, I told you ſo. I was weak enough to entertain that flattering error; but the blind is thrown off. To my misfortune you are born; and as ſuch you have anſwered your end. Get thee far from me, unhappy lad—I reject thee from my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom—I diſclaim, I forſake, and curſe thee forever."</p>
               <p>I trembled at theſe words, my ſpirits fled, and I dropped down ſenſeleſs upon the floor. Far from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the ſmalleſt ſuccor, the barbarous men—ſhall I proceed in this diſmal ſtory? O amiable hoſts, you will be as much ſurpriſed as I was in that cruel mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Suffer me, ah! ſuffer me to dry my tears: I feel they hinder me from going farther.</p>
               <p>I remained in that condition for an hour; judge of my ſurpriſe, when I recovered my ſenſes! My father and Dumont have left me; I ſee them not—where be they?</p>
               <p>A woman, to whom I was indebted for the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of opening again my eyes to light, ſtands by me; ſhe endeavors to comfort me. "Where are they, where are they?" "Alas, my dear child, they ſet out about three quarters of an hour ago."—"And gone! good God! and Dumont, Dumont too."</p>

humane.—"Dumont! what he! traitor! has he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?"</p>
               <p>I run down ſtairs, and made the whole houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echo with my woful lamentations. Every body aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me that Dumont and my father ſet out together in the ſame chaiſe, which had ſtopped with the latter before the inn. What a blow—a terrible blow!</p>
               <p>Soon my grief ceded to a ſullen and ſettled deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; fits of rage ſucceeded to it, and, in ſpite of the aſſiduous care and conſolation of thoſe who ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, I dropped down upon the floor, and rolled my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon it; I ſwallowed the duſt, and put forth the moſt diſmal cries; cries that would have moved the moſt flinty heart.</p>
               <p>In this cruel ſtate I remained until three o'clock in the afternoon; bereft of my ſenſes, I could hardly ſee what was doing about me. "The poor lad," ſaid they, "don't you ſee that it was his father and his preceptor; they have forſaken him. Oh, had we known it, they ſhould not have got off ſo eaſy—But no, they go: Take care of him! they may come back. How barbarous! What a pity at ſuch an age, &amp;c."</p>
               <p>My ſituation ſeemed to touch every body, and all offered to relieve me, but I was far from accepting any ſuccor. The maſter of the inn invited me to ſtay at his houſe: I will give you ſome employment, my good friend; you ſhall not want for what is neceſſary. To be ſure you wont be ſo well off as you was at your father's, for there is nothing like home, after all, &amp;c. &amp;c." Every word he ſaid thruſt dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into my heart. I reſolved to rid myſelf of his importunities, and taking my baggage upon my back took leave of them all.</p>
               <p>I left Valence, perplexed with the moſt dreadful thoughts, but making God and religion my ſhield, I ſoon repulſed thoſe enemies which preyed upon all my ſenſes, and I ſaw myſelf before the town of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans at the decline of day.</p>
               <p>Thus Alexis ended the hiſtory of his misfortunes, and Candour, Germain, and Clara, embraced and ſhew him every token of the moſt exquiſite ſenſibility. A frugal repaſt was ſerved up, and the remaining

               <head>A NIGHT SCENE.</head>
               <p>THE narrative of our hero's misfortunes operated, in a ſingular manner, upon Candor, Germain, and Clara. Candor, above all could not be tired on looking at him for the whole time the ſupper laſted. He had placed Alexis next to him, and from time to time would exclaim, "What, my ſon—ſo young and ſuch a knowledge of mankind;—How, you know them well;—Your philoſophy, your courage, all in thee intereſt me to a point. O my Alexis, I depend upon your ſteadineſs with the moſt conſolatory expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. I will diſcloſe them ſome day, you ſhall help me. But ſtay, I will try you for a twelvemonth. Be my ſon, you have no father; let me ſupply his place. Alexis, promiſe me as much ſubmiſſion and docility as you would for a father!"—"Yes, father, I promiſe every thing." "Upon your honor?" "Heaven be my witneſs." "Give me thy hand, and remember one day the ſacred engagement you have entered into with Candor." Your favors will never make me forget it." "I was happy and powerful in the world, my cloſeſt boſom friends have thrown me into the abyſs of ills; Germain alone ſtood by me, Germain, my good and honeſt friend, love him as I do: what a treaſure is a truſty, faithful ſervant. Behold Clara; my only daughter, my every thing—be her tutor; teach her all the ſciences, all the accompliſhments you are maſter of: May ſhe profit by your leſſons, and above all may ſhe take
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030364_0058_0FE5D1C201750048"/>
your ſage advice, that prudence, that miſtruſt in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, qualities ſo requiſite for a being deſtined to live ſome day in the boſom of ſociety. For I am old and hoary, my good children, I cannot always be with you, and when I am once gone, perhaps you may have the moſt ardent deſire of living in towns, of launching into the whirlpool." "Ah, never, never," anſwered Alexis and Clara, in conjunction with each other.</p>
               <p>Alexis was tranſported with joy. Clara ſqueezed his hand, embraced her father and Germain, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured with the happy proſpect that glowed in her beauteous eyes, ſhe could not conceal her ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>They ſoon aroſe from their frugal repaſt, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor would have Alexis to take an exact view of the hermitage, in which the old man thought he would remain for life.</p>
               <p>Clara laid hold immediately of the youth's arm, Candor, ſupported himſelf on Germain's ſhoulder, and all four went to viſit the ſeveral parts of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. Let us follow their traces, and get acquainted with an abode where we ſhall, for ſome time, dwell with them.</p>
               <p>They firſt entered a yard, ninety feet ſquare, its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre is occupied by the cottage. The lateral extent of the edifice is thirty, and the height fifty feet.</p>
               <p>They aſcend four ſteps, enter a ſmall veſtibule; where Alexis perceives at the bottom of the ſtairs, two doors, the one on the right and the other on the left. The firſt conducts to the kitchen, and the ſecond to a hall fifteen feet high, furniſhed with a chimney, a table, chairs, and a conſiderable library.</p>
               <p>He leaves the hall, and goes up ſome winding ſtairs to the firſt floor; on this ſide is Candor's bed chamber. A bed, a large cheſt of drawers, two portraits, half a dozen of fowling pieces, and ſome chairs are the only furniture he ſees in it.</p>
               <p>Clara's chamber is not better decorated, excepting a fine harpſicord which takes up the greateſt part of the room.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond ſtory he enters two little rooms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a chimney, but very ſnug and decent.</p>
               <p>Above them is a large garret, which ſupplies the place of a hay loft, and granary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:030364_0059_0FE5D1BD60DE1BB8"/>
Every ceiling is vaulted, and built of ſtone: Every window of the apartments is grated with iron bars, and does not exceed ſix feet in height. Below ſtairs is a door leading to a cellar, to which no body but Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Germain, had acceſs. This cave or cellar contains neither wine nor liquors, (our hermits had long ſince left off to make uſe of them) there is nothing pent in it but—This is a myſtery we ſhall certainly diſcover hereafter, but now it muſt remain concealed. Let us therefore follow our hero to the garden.</p>
               <p>It is an incloſure of about an acre and an half, the third part planted with peas, beans, potatoes, oats, &amp;c. &amp;c. and the remainder a meadow yielding hay for the horſe. There were alſo ſeveral fruit trees, and at the garden's end, a very lofty poplar, which appeared to have been left ſince the ground was firſt cleared to build the cottage and its premiſes. At the foot of the poplar, a limpid rivulet ſpringing from a remote part of the woods, ſtreams over a layer of pebbles, and eaſes itſelf in a frightful precipice, at the diſtance of two leagues from the cottage.</p>
               <p>The rivulet, croſſing the little garden, is hemmed in its career by a dike of ſhell work, which it ſurmounts, and forms a caſcade, whoſe waters, fall into a baſon near the meadow, hewn, as it were, by the hand of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the heart of a rock.</p>
               <p>A little bridge leading to a grove, the work of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, invites the philoſopher to taſte the ſweets of the evening, and reſt from the toils of the day: the whole of this rural and tranquil reſidence breathes calm tho't and ſolitude.</p>
               <p>Alexis ſurveying with admiration thoſe wonders of art and nature, lifted up his hand to heaven, to return thanks to the ſublime Author, for having brought him to this delightful abode, where he can at leaſt enjoy repoſe in the arms of the only beings, in whoſe hearts he had found generoſity, ſympathy and virtue.</p>
               <p>Clara, who was leading him before her father, eager to ſhew him all the beauties of her garden, did not fail to expatiate upon its charms. "Do you ſee," ſaid ſhe, "yonder that field? I alone have cultivate it; but now, as you are my partner, my labor will be changed
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030364_0060_0FE5D1C2CF6EB2E8"/>
into mere pleaſure: It is in this rivulet we ſhall quench our thirſt; you will offer me this limped water, and I will receive it at your hands: here you will ſmile; there you will ſeek ſhelter from the heat of day: I will preſs one of thoſe fruits upon your burning lips, and its nect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar will refreſh your blood. Oh! how often ſhall we at the decline of day, go to take reſt in the grove. It is there, unknown to all the world far from the buſtling and noiſe of cities, we ſhall bleſs and endear our being. The ſun goes down, the moon plays, here and there, her ſilver beams through the foliage of the thicket. The boſom of the earth opens and and exhales a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perfumes. We fit by one another; the gentle purling of this rivulet, which glides beneath our feet, throws us into the ſweets of thought; you preſs my hand to your heart, it beats, we give up all thinking; yet we gaze and enjoy! O Alexis, Alexis, belive thy Clara, "HERE SHALT THOU FIND HAPPINESS."</p>
               <p>In vain Alexis endeavored to reply, his feelings would not ſuffer him to expreſs his thoughts; he contented himſelf with ſqueezing Clara's hand, and holding her with that expreſſion of ſentiment which is more obvious to the pencil than to the eloquence. "O yes," ſaid he, with a low voice, "yes I am already as happy as mortal can be."</p>
               <p>Candor and Germain who came ſoon after, found the young couple in the extacy of delight. Germain ſhook his head, Candor ſmiled, and his children were put to the bluſh.</p>
               <p>By this time the night began to lower upon nature. The birds perched in the wood, waited the retreat of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to ſuſpend their warbling, and to reſt upon the hoſpitable branch. The nightingale alone enchanted the woods with her ſweet melodies, and the moping owl, in deferrence to her, forebore her funeral howlings. All invited our anchorets to return to the cottage, to enjoy a repoſe, claimed by the emotions which they felt that day, and the fatigue the preceding night.</p>
               <p>They had no convenience to ſubſtitute artificial light to that of day; the ſun ſhut their eyes, and aurora re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opened them. Thus they retired to their reſpective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, not to meet till day break.</p>

Alexis, having received the tender embrace of the three hoſts went up ſtairs to his room ſituated on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond floor; he was determined to reject the calls of ſleep, to reflect freely upon his preſent ſituation, and upon what conduct he ſhould obſerve towards his new friends, ſo as to convince them of his gratitude and tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>He had already forgot his miſanthropy and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, when a very particular event revived them, bolted in his mind, and perplexed his ſenſes.</p>
               <p>He had hardly commenced his meditations, than he heard a noiſe at the door: He liſtens, hears the rattling of keys, one is put in the lock of his door, he aſks who is there? no anſwer, in a moment the door is lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the jailor diſappears! What means this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected precaution? why will they ſhut him up? what do they want of him? O heaven! ſhould it be treachery? the houſe where he was received with open arms, ſhould it be a den of ruffians? what, Candor, Germain, Clara, Clara! it is impoſſible. Perfidiouſneſs cannot conceal itſelf ſo well under the maſk of virtue: A look a geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the leaſt motions detect it. They are not traitors, but why is he locked up? they have not appriſed him of this detention; nor even did his jailor give him an anſwer. Ah! they ſurely will undo him! he has been too confident, too indiſcreet: He ſhould not have expoſed himſelf; In a word, people, that inhabit a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified retreat, in a foreſt notorious for its robbers and banditti. All becomes ſuſpicion to him: he recollects the converſation of the day, an expreſſion of Candor's chills him with terror; <hi>O my Alexis! I depend upon your ſteadineſs with the moſt conſolatory expectation. I will diſcloſe them ſome day; you ſhall help me.</hi> Great God! will they conſtrain a virtuous and well principled youth to become a robber! after all, what do they mean by this? ſhould not the cellar which they would not let him ſee, conceal the murdered victims and the ſpoil? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this diſcourſe, and myſterious cellar conceal crimes. Alexis doubts no longer, his head becomes light, his imagination works, ghaſtly ſpectres appear to him, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid phantoms, from all ſides croſs his chamber, his hair ſtands at an end, his tongue becomes heavy, he
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030364_0062_0FE5D1CCDA8D0EE0"/>
remains motionleſs, and reſolves upon ſome violent meaſure.</p>
               <p>The window of his room was on the garden ſide, he runs to it, he will elope from the fatal houſe where the moſt dreadful omens trouble his reaſon. But an unforeſeen obſtacle is in his way, and ſanctions his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions by certainty. Large iron bars oppoſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: It is all over, he is impriſoned, betrayed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
               <p>As the timid bird who falls into the net, and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards put in a cage, beats the hoſtile wire with its wings, and paſſing his bill acroſs, pants for the tree, which he perceives, and on which he was perched a little before; thus our hero applies his mouth to the fatal bars, beholding acroſs the garden, and the vaſt extent of the foreſt, whoſe gloomy abode appears to him preferable to the odious priſon, where he preſumes he will be obliged to remain all his life time.</p>
               <p>In ſpite of all this, his ſenſible ſoul was ſtill to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo another ſhock. Will he have ſtrength ſufficient to bear the frightful ſpectacle that will preſent itſelf to his fight? At firſt he hears ſomebody ſhut the door of the cellar, that object of his terror, with a terrible noiſe, ſoon after Candor, and Germain come forth, carrying each a lighted flambeaux in their hands. A kind of a coffin covered with a pall, is ſeen on their ſhoulders: They ſilently croſs the garden, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the foot of the poplar tree, near the borders of the limpid rivulet: Here they take off their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the diſtance only hinders Alexis from hearing or ſeeing what they do.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Candor appears to open the coffin: He lays down upon it, he riſes again, a fire is kindled, the flame blazes, riſes, and on a ſudden becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct: the tree is glanced, the leaves tremble, and the birds ſitting on its branches flee with diſmal ſhrieks: the flambeaux are exſtinguiſhed, all vaniſhes.</p>
               <p>It is an illuſion? is it a phantom? the moon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered obſcure by the pale light of the torches ſpread alone her myſtic beams: the birds return to their wonted tree, Candor and Germain appear again, they
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030364_0063_0FE5D1CDD1B86C38"/>
croſs the garden, return to ſet by the coffin in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cave, the door is ſhut, the rattling of keys, and the hollow ſound of bolts are heard again.</p>
               <p>Let now the reader place himſelf in the ſituation of my Alexis. He knows his fearful, ſuſpicions, and miſtruſting temper! Let him have an idea of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment, his apprehenſions, his ſhuddering! How agitated his mind! That coffin, that flame! what can have been that ceremony he could not diſtinguiſh: It is perhaps the body of ſome ſtrayed traveller, which they burnt, after having ſtripped it. He doubts no more: To morrow the ſame fate awaits him: But where are his riches? why ſhould they kill him? his ſpoil is not brilliant enough: No matter, he has all to fear. Perhaps Candor, deceived by the world, has ſworn to ſacrifice all ſuch as will fall in his hands, to gratify his vengeance. Alexis is perhaps to augment the number of his victims: all confirm him in that idea. Alas! what has he done, that fate ſhould have brought him to this deteſtable den! He regrets not life, it is a burden to him! but to fall by ſo baſe a treachery, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having truſted to the good faith and humanity of his butchers. This, this alone, cauſes his deſpair, and makes him wiſh for the approach of day, in order to take a reſolution: He will not ſuffer himſelf to be ſlaughtered thus patiently; he will ſell his life as dear as he can. Tremble aſſaſſins, you ſhall not give him the mortal blow without having ſtood moſt vigorous in his own defence againſt Candor, Germain, and—Clara! what, is Clara guilty too?</p>

                  </gap>res of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian; all nature was beauteous and tranquil; but the heart of Alexis was not.</p>
               <p>Pale, trembling, bewildered, he waited the fatal doom of death; already had he recommended himſelf to the mercy of the ſupreme Being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prayer, in ſome manner, reſtored the calm of his ſenſes; he juſt roſe from his knees, when a gentle voice call him; "A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis, are you awake?"—"Yes," exclaimed he, "yes, I am, and prepared for all events!"—"It is Candor," replied the voice, "he comes to open your door and to embrace you!"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To embrace you!</hi>—Alexis was quite aſtoniſhed: Was this a new ſnare? Did his judgment deceive him? he made a thouſand conjectures, when Candor opens the door, enters, and is ſtruck with the perplexity of his friend. He looks at him, lays hold of his hand, and, with ſuch an air of penetration and truth, that Alexis cannot help liſtening to him, and makes him bluſh at his errors; he ſays, "What have you, my ſon—what means the trouble in which I ſee you?—Is it becauſe I have kept you laſt night in a kind of captivity?—My friend, you would have wronged me, not to confide in your Candor?—I cannot believe it:—I would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to think—compoſe yourſelf, hear your father, and conquer that childiſh fear which cannot but grieve me.</p>
               <p>"You were looked up laſt night, and every future night I muſt obſerve the ſame precaution, which is more eſſential to me than you imagine. It ought not to alarm you, becauſe, the whole day I ſhall give you a thouſand proofs of my ſincere, friendſhip; but I inſiſt upon your not endeavoring to penetrate into that fatal ſecret. It is all I cheriſh, it is all I poſſeſs, do not tear it from me! My Alexis, did you but know!—Deſerve my confidence, be always ſubmiſſive, tender, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardful; and ſoon I will diſcloſe you my condition and misfortunes. Make yourſelf worthy of that confeſſion!—I will not conceal it from you; nay, I expect of you a moſt ſignal ſervice—but a ſervice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

affect your delicacy. I am old. Alexis, I have been inhumanly betrayed; I was deprived of what I held moſt dear on earth. You ſhall be mine avenger.—You ſhall deſerve the charming recompenſe, which I have de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lined for you; the charming recompenſe which will be dear to your heart!—Urge me not to ſay more—I conjure you, let me keep my ſecret for a while—one day I will depoſit it in your boſom—you will know me then; but as yet, I am compelled to reſtrain your curioſity; I do not conſtrue it into a crime, it is natural to your age. Every night permit me to look you up, I beg it as a favor! On theſe terms live with us, diſpel all cares and anxiety, and be truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that your innocence is in no kind of danger in this ſolitary abode; we all cheriſh religion, wiſdom and virtue!"</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe, and the venerable appearance of the old man, rid Alexis of all perplexity. The balm of conſolation deſcended into his heart, and ſerenity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened again his countenance. His ſoul was frank and honeſt; he communicated his fooliſh panic to Candor, ſmiled and embraced him. Clara's father was ſome time confuſed when he heard that Alexis had ſeen his nocturnal ceremony; but ſoon he recovered himſelf, laid hold of his arm, and both went below to Clara, who had juſt riſen, and had as bad a night as her young friend, but from a cauſe of a quite oppoſite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Love, which began to enter her heart, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which awaited her, and her own flattering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had kept her awake all night long; but it only ſerved to add new energy to her charms; her eyes betrayed an air of langor, for which her father chid her, and ſhe bluſhed with ſo much grace, as made Alexis quite contrite for having doubted a ſingle mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute the ſincerity of that lovely child.</p>
               <p>Soon after, Germain joined them, and they all three requeſted their new gueſt to give them a ſpecimen of his abilities on the harpſichord. Alexis, with eager compliance, ſung his romance, and the audience could not forbear ſhedding tears.</p>
               <p>Clara performed after him, and though her ſkill was not equal in point of perfection to that of Alexis, he
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030364_0066_0FE5D1D173505A40"/>
was enraptured with her performance, eſpecially with a ſong ſhe added to it. She had compoſed it during night, and the muſic was ſo ſweet and melodious, as to leave Candor much in doubt of its being of her own compoſing.</p>

               <p>Thus the day was ſpent in pleaſing amuſement. At night Alexis was locked up, but felt no uneaſineſs, and enjoyed a ſound ſleep.</p>

                  <p>I can't tell. I was brought up in a convent till I was eight years old; my mother came often to ſee me.

               <head>THE VOICE IN THE FOREST.</head>
               <p>ALEXIS, happy and cheriſhed in the cottage, had forgot his misfortunes. Muſic, agriculture, and ſometimes the ſport of the chaſe in the foreſt took up all his time, and left him no leiſure to be diſguſted.</p>

They had every thing they wanted; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired no more, and all nature ſeemed to reſpect their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and to co-operate in their happineſs. The thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which ſtruck inceſſantly the loftieſt trees of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, had never deſcended on their premiſes; the robbers, who were heard all day long, crying and ſhouting about its walls, had never formed the deſign, perhaps impracticable, to ſcale them. Germain le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage only once a year to go to St. Marcellin, to buy corn, and doubtleſs by a viſible protection of heaven, he had never been attacked, except the laſt time, when he was relieved by Alexis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Candor had expreſsly enjoined Clara not to tell her young friend where ſhe had been on the day ſhe had met with him in the valley of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, becauſe he himſelf intended to give one day every detail of it to Alexis, and exact from his hand a moſt terrible revenge, which he wiſhed to take of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies before he ſhould go down to the grave.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this intent, he ſtudied daily the character and temper of Alexis, and flattered himſelf to ſee him always ſteady and courageous; he thanked heaven, for having ſent him in his ills a being perhaps the only one on earth, capable to execute his projects. It was with complacency he beheld the love ſubſiſting between the young couple; he protected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030364_0071_0FE5D1EF1801D408"/>
waited till it had reached its higheſt pitch, to diſcloſe his ſecrets to Alexis. In the mean time he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clara not to ſuffer her lover to take the ſmalleſt liberty with her: He followed them whereſoever they went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> watched them carefully, and apprehending their innocence might be in danger in the little grove, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways joined them there, brought them back to the cottage, and, not ſufficiently confident of his own vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, he made choice of Germain to aſſiſt him.</p>
               <p>All theſe precautions were to no purpoſe; Alexis was too delicate, too virtuous to infringe upon the laws of hoſpitality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Clara endowed with too much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and reſpect to diſobey her father, and commit a fault, which ſhe would never have been able to own. On the other hand, their paſſion was protected, and they had the promiſe to be united. They were at liberty to love and declare their mutual paſſion before Candor. This freedom baniſhed the very idea of crime; and if love ſometimes ventured to put the blind upon their eyes, the light of truth ſoon ſhook it off, with offering to their ſight the abyſs in which they would plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ge themſelves, and a ſenſe of ſhame and remorſe ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſſail them upon leaving the grove.</p>
               <p>Thus the two children loved one another; but their love was pure, decent, grounded upon virtue, upon ſelf-eſteem, and the voluntary conſent of a father.</p>
               <p>Sweet ſympathy of the ſoul, unſullied by the mean impulſe of ſenſuality, ſatisfied with calm ſentiment and reflection, a ſtranger to ſore remorſe, to guilty ſecreſy, to guilty diffidence, and ſanctioned by paternal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity—ah! how few are the hearts deſtined to feel thy delights!</p>
               <p>Alexis, who by this time perceived the ſcrupulous vigilance of Candor and Germain, deemed it an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front upon his principles. The ſole idea of being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of treachery, ſapped the happineſs he enjoyed. Often when returned from a walk, where Candor had interrupted a delicious <hi>tête-à-tête,</hi> he would go to his room, regardleſs of the tokens of love and affection which the old man continually laviſhed upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhed a torrent of tears. What ſhould, would he exclaim, I be capable of? and can they think it?—I am dogged
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030364_0072_0FE5D1EFE5C46560"/>
and watched as if there was any occaſion to apprehend that I could ſo far forget myſelf, as to betray the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence I enjoy, and to ſeduce an innocent child! It ſeems they cannot read in my heart! no, they will never know it; that feeling heart, fraught with grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude and delicacy, is torn by the moſt outrageous ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion!—Alas! will men never do me juſtice! O Candor, Candor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how you grieve me!</p>
               <p>Candor often ſurpriſed him in theſe acceſſes of a gloomy temper; he inquired for the cauſe of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but Alexis remained ſilent; the remembrance of his misfortunes was his excuſe; and the old man, who knew him to be candid and ſincere, believed, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and engaged him to a walk in the garden, and, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his careſſes, partly by dint of argument, diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the melancholy of his young friend.</p>

               <p>In this manner, Candor, Clara, Alexis and Germain, paſſed their life at the Cottage. They always termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the buſineſs of the day by a rural walk; they all four ſat down in the right grove on the borders of the limpid rivulet, they returned, enjoyed a frugal meal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and taſted the ſweets of a quiet ſleep, from which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could rouſe them but the riſing of Aurora, and the concerts of birds.</p>
               <p>At the expiration of a twelvemonth, our young couple loved no more, but adored each other. It was a violent paſſion which nothing could keep within bounds but the hope of a ſpeedy union. They were determined to ſpeak of it to Candor, and to crave upon their knees his parental bleſſing, as a tie as ſacred
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030364_0073_0FE5D1F1392DA260"/>
in their eyes, as the auguſt ceremony of wedlock, which they had no opportunity to obtain; but the old man; equally cunning and vindictive, had waited for that inſtant, to lay open his projects to Alexis. He had himſelf foſtered in his breaſt the flames of love, and ſuffered the paſſion of Alexis to attain the very pitch of violence, only with a view to be convinced of his fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to ſerve him. He was, however, unacquainted with the firmneſs and ſpirit of our young hero; he intended putting them to trial, in order to be ſure of his inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attachment, as to defer, a little longer, the ſtory of his misfortunes, which he had promiſed to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Alexis, for his own part, always miſtruſting and ſuſceptible, was alarmed at the delays of Candor. He had repeatedly entreated h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Alexis returned to the cottage, where Candor, who ſaw his trouble, chid him for his melancholy: the youth ſtammered, and excuſed himſelf as well as he could, his ſoul longed for ſolitude, and he took a walk by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the remoteſt part of the garden, on the borders of the rivulet. Quite loſt in thought, he approached the wall, which ſeparated the premiſes from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; he thought he heard a ſweet voice uttering his name. He looks, he liſtens, and ſoon a perſon in the wood, on the brink of the ditch of the habitation, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes him in theſe words; "Alexis, thy ſufferings are at an end. Turn thy eyes upon the rivulet which ſtreams at thy feet, and read."</p>

                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:030364_0075_0FE5D1FFDDB50AA0"/>
Alexis, quite motionleſs, looks into the ſtream, and his aſtoniſhment increaſes upon ſeeing, tied to a branch of a buſh, a letter which the unknown perſon had thrown on his ſide, and which paſt through the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was made in the wall. He ſeizes the branch, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nties the letter, and eagerly reads the following lines, which moved him to the higheſt degree:</p>
               <p>"Heaven, my dear Alexis, is finally appeaſed: your father acknowledges you for his ſon. Leave the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and the woods of <hi>Chamborau:</hi> Come to meet him at <hi>St. Etienna,</hi> where he, with your friend Dumont, is waiting for you. To receive you, his arms are open. When to-morrow's ſun ſhall hide itſelf in the water, come, alone, to the ſpot where the foreſt forms a ſtar marked with ſix martlets. It is there you will find a faithful guide, who is to conduct you to the moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and moſt tender of fathers."</p>
               <p>What a peruſal for Alexis! He queſtions the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but is not anſwered. To all appearance he is gone. His father waits for him, his father acknowledges him for his ſon! Heaven, in what moment does he hear tidings, which, at other times, he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the greateſt of bleſſings! But how is he to act now? ſhall he renounce love for nature? Shall he betray gratitude for filial tenderneſs? ſhall he fly from the arms of a generous friend to thoſe of a father? What an embarraſſment! what a cruel embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
               <p>Clara's lover remains ſome time in the deepeſt gloom of reflection: He takes this adventure for an illuſion; he cannot believe that what he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As he knows it, why does not he himſelf come to fetch him, in order to ſee and thank the good old man who received his ſon in his houſe? Why does he fear to appear before Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor? Juſtice, gratitude, all, makes it his duty! But does he know of the paſſion of Alexis for Clara? does he fear the effects of that paſſion? Well, if he does, the greater reaſon has he to prevent them by his preſence. But the letter he has received is not of his father's writing: he might well have wrote himſelf. That

myſteriouſneſs, the ſtranger, the guide who waits for him, all looks very ſuſpicious. Should it be a contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the calumniator, of whom he received once a perfidious advice, engraved on the bark of the tree? Yes, yes, it muſt be ſome ſtratagem: He has certain ſecret enemies who conſpired his ruin, who will tear him from this abode of peace, to devote him to deſtruction! All mankind is againſt him, and were he at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the pole, ſtill there would be traitors, bent to perſecute him?—But, after all, if it were true!—If his father and Dumont were waiting for him in the village of St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Etienne!—Who knows!—They indeed leſt him at Valence; but they may have diſcovered which way he went; people may have been ſet to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him even as far as the cottage.—All this is poſſible. What ſhall he do? What reſolution ought he to take?—Here nature chides him: Can you fly the careſſes of thy father? Here love and gratitude are combined to detain him. Which of either ſhall he obey? Which of either is the moſt imperative voice that appeals to his heart? Which of either will prove victorious?—O A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis, Alexis, what wilt thou do! unfortunate youth, what wilt thou do!</p>

heart ſeemed to be willing to force its way through his breaſt, to repair to the ſpot where he knew his father waited for him. Alexis could not ſee the village of St. Etienne, but he gueſſed its ſituation, and ſaid to himſelf: Romans lies to the ſouth; St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellin on this ſide; and St. Etienne facing the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain covered with woods. Yes, St. Etienne lies there, my father and Dumont are near me! O why cannot my eyes pierce through the obſtacles which part us! Why not ſee and examine them!—What do I ſay? Their image is in my ſoul.—There they are, ſitting by one another: They ſigh, and ſay, Will Alexis come to join us?—Will Alexis prefer his father to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs?—Will nature have greater command over his heart than love? Will it be in vain for me to hold out my arms to him and to call him aloud!—Ah! my ſon! come, come, my mouth ſmiles at you; my eyes only wait for your boſom, to pour in it a flood of tears; my heart longs to feel the beating of your's. Will you come my Alexis, will you come?—Yes, I will, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yes I'll embrace your knees; my ſoul ſhall be united with your's—O Alexis! O moſt ungrateful of all men! Could'ſt thou heſitate, could'ſt thou waver? deſcend into your heart, it will preſcribe your duty, and tell you what is a lover, what is a benefactor. Are they above a father? Can friendſhip, can gratitude, equal paternal fondneſs! O ſacred names of a father, of a ſon, are you not holier than thoſe of a lover and a friend!—I am reſolved; this evening, I will leave the cottage, I will quit forever Candor and Clara.—For ever!—great God!—for ever!—beings ſo generous, ſo virtuous!—O my father, what a ſacrifice do you exact of me!—it is above my power; yes, I feel it will be impoſſible for me to conſummate it.—But cruel parent, why did not you come yourſelf? Why did you write by a hand not your own? That letter, that ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that guide, who is to conduct me—yet, that guide!—ſhould it be yourſelf—yes, my father, it is you—I ſhall meet you in the foreſt: My heart tells me ſo; it cannot deceive me!

               <p>Alexis endeavored to anſwer, but his grief would not permit him: He only preſſed her hand and then retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Clara, who had never ſeen him ſo downcaſt, ſaw him go; her beautiful eyes were filled with tears: She mechanically, followed as it were, the traces of her young friend, and ſtopping on the banks of the rivulet, near the bridge that leads to the grove, ſhe was highly amazed to ſee Alexis write ſome characters upon the bark of the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>plar. She hid herſelf behind an antique willow, and watched attentively every motion of her lover, intending, as ſoon as he ſhould be gone, to read the inſcription he made on the tree. Alexis, at certain times interrupted his task, lifted his hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, and uttered the moſt woful moans. Soon after, he kiſſed the characters which he had traced, and with a ſlow pace returned to the cottage, not without turning round, and coming back upon his footſteps.</p>
               <p>

No ſooner Clara ſaw him at too great a diſtance to be perceived by him, than ſhe ran trembling to the great poplar. What became of her, when upon it ſhe read theſe words?</p>
               <p>"O you tender friends, objects of my thoughts, that ought to expect a more grateful return, accuſe not my heart of a forcible flight! one day you will ſee me again."</p>
               <p>Clara attempts to read the fatal lines again; but her eyes cannot ſee; a cloud of darkneſs covers them; her tongue denies its office, ſhe drops down ſenſeleſs upon the turf and remains in that condition, which nobody could gueſs, without the ſmalleſt ſuccour. She howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gradually recovered her ſenſes, and her unfaithful remembrance hides from her the cauſe of her perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhe riſes, ſees herſelf, with aſtoniſhment, open her eyes again to light: Soon the happy darkneſs which covered her ſoul vaniſhed; ſhe repents not having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the traces of her lover, and quickly enters the cottage, where ſhe cries with a loud voice, Alexis! Alexis! ungrateful man, it is Clara who calls you! anſwer me, oh, anſwer me!—Alexis could hear no more, in conſequence of Candor's having given him leave to go a hunting; he had juſt left the cottage; he was in the foreſt, he looked at the drawbridge which had juſt ſhut itſelf behind him, and doubting whether he ſhould have it let down again, he could neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, nor return. What a ſituation for his feeling heart! What, exclaimed he, Candor, the reſpectable Candor, who does not ſuſpect my project, and has juſt given me tokens of the moſt tender friendſhip—ſhould I leave him!—Oh God! how ungrateful!—And Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, poor Clara! what will ſhe become, if ſhe reads my laſt farewel upon the great poplar? She will ſee that I was forced to go, ſhe will ſee that I am to return one day.—Yes, I will return, my generous friends, you will ſee me again; and will to-morrow hinder me from coming here with my father and Dumont?—Oh! they will not be able to diſapprove of my project; they will follow me; to-morrow I ſhall embrace Candor, he will pardon me; I will go, I will proceed on my journey, embrace my father who waits for me at a little diſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heaven be praiſed for this favor, it baffles all expreſſion!</p>

Alexis turned his face towards the cottage, he ſhed tears, then took his road as he was directed by the letter: He had now walked half a league in the forreſt, when the ſky was imperceptibly overcaſt with clouds, the lightning rent the air, the thunder roared, whole cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts of water poured down from the irritated elements, and the blackeſt darkneſs covered all nature. Alexis, moved at the dreadful ſcene, felt his knees tottering; terror ſeized his ſoul he was almoſt convinced that heaven, provoked at his ingratitude, would ſhiver him into atoms, he had almoſt ſuccumbed under the weight of his grief, when a ſpacious cavern preſents itſelf to his ſight. He enters, to avoid the heavenly wrath; he ventures to ſtep a little forward; all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den an involuntary horror makes him tremble; his hair ſtands at an end, he thinks to ſee ſpectres that purſue and ſtop him; he believes he hears the voice of Clara and Candor; it is they, it is their voice; they load him with reproaches and curſes. Heavens where is he to ſeek refuge? The phantoms purſue him wherever he goes; on all ſides ſighs and ſhrieks reſound in his ears. Let us for a moment leave him in this critical ſituation, and ſee what paſſes in the cottage.</p>
               <p>Clara, after ſhe had read the words, written on the great poplar, ran back to the cottage in hopes to find Alexis; but what was her ſurprize when her father informs her that he is not there, but went a hunting in the ſoreſt—"A hunting!" cried Clara; "ah, my father, he flies from you, he leaves you forever!"—"What do you ſay, my daughter?"—"Yes, the ungrateful Alexis is gone!—We ſhall ſee him no more."—"But how do you know this?"—"Liſten, my father, liſten to me and know all his treachery."</p>
               <p>Here Clara told Candor and Germain the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the poplar tree, and begged her father to ſend Germain after him, not to bring him back, but to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him in the blackeſt terms, for his ingratitude.—Candor heard patiently Clara's report, and ſhewed her that the project ſhe had conceived was quite imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable. Which way indeed could he ſend in purſuit of him? Which way did he go? A whole hour at leaſt
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030364_0081_0FE5D20B31F7E2A8"/>
had elapſed ſince his departure.—Beſides, in ſuch wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! would it be worth while to brave the tempeſt and lightning to run after a traitor? No, my dear Clara, continued he, it is uſeleſs to give ourſelves any trouble, you ſhall ſee your Alexis, you ſhall ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: but he ſhall pay dear for the torments he cauſes Clara!—Withdraw for a while to your apartment, and leave me to conſult with Germain upon what can be done.</p>
               <p>Clara kiſſed her father's hand, and repaired to her apartment where ſhe wept bitterly. Thus ſhe ſpent the beſt part of the evening and night, without ſeeing either Candor or Germain! The latter came finally to open her priſon (for ſhe had been under key;) "Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, (ſaid he) follow me, you will ſee him again."—"Who? Alexis?"—"Himſelf, he is here."—"O heaven! ſhall I—yes, I will—let us go, Germain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me to the traitor!—will he be able to ſtand in my preſence?"</p>
               <p>Thus ſhe ſpoke—Germain immediately laid hold of her hand, and made her go down to the place where ſhe had never been before; but let us not dwell on a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, which we ſhall give hereafter; but let us ſee how Alexis was conducted to it.</p>
               <p>We left him in a cavern of the foreſt, haunted by remorſe and fantaſtic apparitions. He was now an hour in it, when he thought he heard a voice at the bottom of the ſubterranean; He liſtens, the voice ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters his name; it is no viſion, a feeble light glimmers at a diſtance before him. Is it a ſnare? ſhall he go and follow that voice which may make him tumble into ſome abyſs? Yes, Alexis, promoted by a ſupernat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural courage; riſks the adventure. Whoſoever you be, (calls he out to the man who carried the light, whoſe features he could not diſtinguiſh) whoſoever you be, I will follow you boldly; but what do you want of me? No anſwer is given. He advances, and the light diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears before him. What intrepidity in a young man of eighteen; to be ſure ſo extraordinary an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture was worth his notice: Alexis thought he ſaw ſpectres—he trembled—now he followed a man, and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030364_0082_0FE5D248F2778A58"/>
his firmneſs returned: frightful illuſions often deceive more than credulity.</p>
               <p>He therefore walked before his guide, and diſtance always hindered him from recognizing his face. His paſſage took up about another hour; he remarked a thouſand beauties in this grotto; now a ſupurb petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction offered itſelf to his ſight, then a little rivulet running over layers of pebbles preſented Itſelf to him, and all on a ſudden leſt him to loſe itſelf in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of a rock. In ſhort, this vaſt grotto appeared ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the work of nature than of art.</p>
               <p>At the end of the cavern the guide opened a door, and diſappeared. Alexis, by the light which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived acroſs the door, purſued his way, and his aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment became ſo great as not to permit him to think. At laſt he ſaw himſelf in a ſplendid temple, whoſe door ſhut itſelf after him. The floor and columns were of black marble, and on the ceiling hung a lamp which caſt a deadly gleam. In the centre of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeveral ſteps led to a magnificent tomb; above it he ſaw a picture repreſenting a woman with a child in her lap. Alexis, ſtruck with all theſe things, had no doubt of the portraits being thoſe of the perſons laid in the tomb. But what place could it be? Who was he that conducted him to it? His guide had diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, he was alone, ſhut up, and nobody came to let him out.—Alexis began to repent of his too great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, when, lo, a door opens—a venerable old man appears—Heaven! can he believes his own eyes?—it is Candor—Candor himſelf! O earth open, and let the unhappy Alexis hide his remorſe in thy boſom!</p>
               <p>Ungrateful, ſaid the old man to him, ungrateful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis! where are your promiſes? Where are your oaths? you was to have lived and died with us, and you fly, you forſake us!—I ſee but too well the trial was above your ſtrength! I ſuſpected the inſtability of your reſolutions.—You look at me; I can read in your eyes the ſurpriſe which my diſcourſe cauſes. Let your aſtoniſhment ceaſe: Know, that the inſcription upon the trees of the foreſt, the ſtranger, the letter the guide, in ſhort, the whole intelligence you receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was an ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſentiments, and to meaſure what degree of confidence I ſhould repoſe in you. Now I am ready to fulfil your wiſhes; I know you, I know how much your friendſhip may be depended on. O treacherous Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is! you have opened my eyes but too much!—I ſee I have loſt all in this world, as there is not one ſingle friend left to me.—Ah! my father, cried Alexis, throwing himſelf at his feet, ah! my generous bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor! yes, you ſpeak the truth, it was a trial too hard for my heart.—But did you know what conflicts and torments I endured! Ah! pardon me, and be perſuaded that it wanted nothing leſs than filial ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs that could balance that you have inſpired me with.</p>
               <p>Candor was going to reply, when a door opened—it is Germain, it is Clara, who came to load the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Alexis with their reproaches, already morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thoſe of the old man. The youth, ſenſible of his error, embraces their knees, bedews them with his tears, deteſts his faults, and expreſſes his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with ſuch a ſenſe of contrite feeling, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and daughter are forced to pity, to indulge and to do him juſtice; for be it as it will, they were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Alexis had done but his duty in following the inſtinct of nature, that he leſt them in hopes to ſee his father again. An exceſs of virtue had made him guilty of ingratitude, and nature was his apology, Candor could not tell him his real way of thinking, ſenſible that the trial he had put him to was too ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that his very tranſgreſſion made his eulogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; he embraced him therefore, and promiſed to forget all. He then bade him to be ſeated on the ſteps of the tomb, and gave the ſame order to his daughter and Germain, and began the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which was an introduction to relate his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures:</p>
               <p>"Alexis, if I ſent Germain to fetch you into the cavern of the foreſt; if he has been your guide hither without your being able to know him; in ſhort, if I receive you for the firſt time in this diſmal place, it is merely to diſcloſe a great deſign which I have conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to exact from your arm a vengeance, which

               <p>The old man wept for a while, became calm by degrees, and commenced the hiſtory of his misfortunes, which Clara herſelf heard now for the firſt time.</p>

Like me, young, briſk, and fiery, his temper bore ſo much reſemblance to mine, that, in a little time, we became ſo intimate, that we could hardly be ſeparated for one moment. He was an orphan, and his education en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to the care of a guardian, who was to reſtore him his whole property when he ſhould come to be of age.</p>

I ſhall not expatiate upon the particulars of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy, nor the circumſtances which cemented it: it will be ſufficient for you to know, that upon leaving the college, where we had ſtudied the <hi>humanities</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I requeſted him to come and ſpend ſome time with me at Grenoble at my father's houſe, to whom I had many times wrote in a very flattering manner, about my friend's conduct, and alſo expreſſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of getting more particular knowledge of him. Duverly at that time complied with an invitation, that quite charmed him: he loved me, or I had at leaſt no reaſon to think to the contrary: but his paſſions were ſoon to operate a change in his perfidious heart, and to infect it with the ſperm of all vices.</p>
               <p>My father, who was kind and generous, received Duverly with great cordiality, and made him the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to make his houſe his home as long as he pleaſed. Duverly gratefully accepted his propoſal, and I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thanks to my father. The latter ſoon became ſo fond of my friend as to blazen forth his merits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve, and to make him, in every thing, the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of my conduct: we both ſtudied the profeſſion of the law, for which Duverly manifeſted more diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and taſte than myſelf. He became alſo daily more grave and ſerious. He had no more for me that confidence, nor made thoſe friendly effuſions which I ſo often experienced from him in his youth; in a word, I found him more reſerved and deliberate. Whatever alarmed me in his conduct; whatever I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an evident change in his friendſhip to me, my father looked upon as an energy of mind, and a diſcretion of character entitled to his admiration. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſaid he, often to me, behold your friend! he ſhows not that levity ſo conſpicuous in your character; he is grave, reaſonable, thinking, and ſolid. Endeavor to preſerve always his friendſhip, and to follow his advice, for I am certain he wiſhes you well. I liſtened to my father, and it being congenial to me, that he could not miſlead me with regard to Duverly my eſteem for the latter heightened, and I tried every thing in my power to re-obtain his confidence, which I thought I had forfeited by my ſailings.</p>

My father was very intimate with an old baroneſs, whoſe name was Myrſange: ſhe was the widow of an officer of horſe, and a few years ſince came to live at Grenoble with her only child, an adorable charming young lady, whom I could not ſee without emotion. My father, my friend and I, were uſed to ſpend the evening at the baroneſs's houſe, and the too lovely Adela made every day ſo great a progreſs in my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that I ſoon was able to diſcern the nature of my ſentiments. I made this confidence to Duverly, who, ſurpriſed and aſtoniſhed, received my avowal with ſuch a kind of indignation as intimidated me from making further confidence. What, ſaid he, do you love Miſs Myrſange? You—only think, Dorance? Think that ſhe is but a ſort of adventurer, whoſe fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily and property are equally unknown to every body. She and her mother, I grant you, make a tolerable figure in this town; but whence come they? Who are they? it is three years ſince they have reſided here; is that enough to know well perſons, who perhaps have been baniſhed or expudiated? Open your eyes, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, acknowledge your folly; your father will never conſent to it, believe me. No, he will never conſent: I know him. He will, I ſuppoſe, make enquiries, and ſhould they not prove ſatisfactory, you know yourſelf the conſequence; in other reſpects he repoſes great truſt in me: and if he aſks my advice, in faith, I will be candid with you, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ent it if you chooſe, yet, I ſhall never give my opinion in favor of ſuch a match. O heaven, what, Duverly—no; depend upon it: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs too much attachment to your well being, not to ſuffer you to throw yourſelf blindly and headlong into a precipice; the day would come, when you would reproach me with having promoted your ruin. My ruin, by all means; have not you dived into the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of that little body? Oh, I know her better than you, I can ſwear; firſt of all I believe ſhe is a haughty, imperious, ſlandering coquet. She has wit, I won't deny her that; but a deceitful, malicious, and ſarcaſtic wit, you yourſelf know it. My dear Dorance is it poſſible; ah, did you know how painful this confeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of your's is to me, painful on your account; for were
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030364_0087_0FE5D21FE39665B8"/>
you not my friend, it would be very indifferent to me, whether you have her or another. Come, promiſe me to follow my advice, and to conquer a fooliſh paſſion, which ſhould never have roſe in your heart.</p>
               <p>The diſcourſe of Duverly aſtoniſhed me to ſuch a degree that I was at a loſs to make a reply—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained motionleſs, my heart was heavy; I was going, I believe, to ſhed tears, when my father by his entering the apartment, interrupted our converſation, and took us with him to the court, where a cauſe highly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting was to be pleaded; it was a couple who had married by inclination and without the conſent of their parents: ſix months having paſt, they became equally odious to one another, and ſued for a divorce. They made uſe of as many invectives as they formerly had made of tender and pious expreſſions, and adduced in their behalf facts ſo attrocious, as would have provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt indelicate ear.</p>
               <p>This ſuit ſtruck me with horror, and Duverly, who perceived it, was pleaſed to add to my confuſion, by puſhing me at every quotation made by the counſellors, and expatiating with a low voice, upon the dangers of an ill-concerted marriage, which each of the couple depicted with equal energy.</p>
               <p>Upon my return, I made the moſt cruel reflections I did not ſuſpect my friend of any ſecret motive to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my paſſion: moreover, my father eſteemed him much, and entertained the moſt flattering notions of his ſpirit and judgment: this was a ſufficient reaſon for me to reſpect him blindly.</p>
               <p>Of all the fears Duverly had cauſed me, none ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me well founded; they were confined to vague ſuſpicions, without proofs, and of no alarming nature. What could I think of Duverly; He had appeared much moved at the confidence I made him of my paſſion: was it his concern for me, which—Oh yes, it was doubtleſs his concern, his friendſhip alone, which made him ſpeak to me. He was perhaps too timid, too prying into futurity; but all this reflects honor upon his heart; he was attached to me: he loved and reſpected my father, and was afraid leſt he ſhould ſee unfortunate, ſome day, the family he cheriſhed.</p>

                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:030364_0088_0FE5D222723499A0"/>
I did abide by theſe reflections, and intended to ſtudy Miſs Myrſange's character, and to renounce her hand, if ever I ſhould diſcover in it the faults he had pointed out.</p>
               <p>My father, however, frequently aſked what I thought of Adela? I dared not to diſcloſe to him my real ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents on that head, leſt they ſhould kindle his wrath. One day he explained h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Dorance, ſaid he, I perceive the daughter of the baroneſs is not indifferent to you; anſwer me, my ſon; open your heart, and thou wilt perhaps not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.—My father—you love her; come, out with the word—Yes, my father, I do love the charming Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la; yes, I do adore her, were you even to load me with all the weight of—O load you!—what means that, my ſon? You accompliſh my wiſhes, and thoſe of her mother;—know that we both deſire to ſee love riſe in your breaſt!—how!—Adelia is your's, Adelia ſhall be your ſpouſe upon condition. What condition? ſpeak father. What condition? That you go to Paris to ſtudy law, to receive inſtructions, and enable your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take the function of my charge, which I ſhall not reſign but in favor of that marriage. To go to Paris, my father! Could not I ſtudy here as well as in Paris? Undoubtedly, but there is no place like Paris for young people to get inſtructed. Beſides, I will recommend you to my beſt friend, Mr. de Calenzieux; he is a counſellor of parliament, and will perhaps take better care of your education than I can do; he is an old ſenator, replete with genius and knowledge: go to him, my ſon, go to draw from him his advice, that prudence and wiſdom ſo neceſſary to him who is to be the judge of his equals: and as you are to ſucceed in office, give me the ſatisfaction to think, when I deſcend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

You ſhall ſet off to-morrow with Duverly, who, I have no doubt (for Mr. de Calenzieux will receive you both with equal pleaſure, and he tells me ſo in his anſwer) will accompany you; then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in a twelve month; yes, in a twelve month you ſhall poſſeſs, Adela, and fulfil the hopes of my old age!</p>

I embraced my father, and retired with the greateſt joy. I was however determined not to mention any thing about the project of my marriage to Duverly, fearing he may try to alter my father's mind, and I only infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him of our intended journey to Paris. I perceived that this news was highly vexatious to him; he turned pale, oppoſed the meaſure for ſome time, and when he made me perceive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> he began to feel the weight of the links of our friendſhip, my father, much occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that day, had only time to ſay a few words to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he requeſted him to accompany me to Paris, and to be my Mentor. My dear Duverly, ſaid he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are a man of ſound and ſolid parts, be vigilant over my ſon, grant him always your friendſhip and your advice, which I command him to follow and to reſpect as mine own. Let him pay attention to you, and he will accompliſh all my wiſhes. Duverly anſwered only ſtammering; I obſerved him to be downcaſt that whole day. At night we went to take our leaves of the baroneſs and her daughter: the latter gave me a very cold reception, caſt down her eyes, and I thought ſhe had been weeping. I paid her a compliment which ſhe did not return: I preſſed her hand without her ſeeming to be moved. Her coldneſs affected me; I could eaſily diſcover that ſhe did not love me; an involuntary bluſh diffuſed itſelf over my face, and I let drop ſome tears. The mother, who perceived my perplexity, endeavored to allay it: ſhe opened her arms, and called me her ſon. I obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave of her to embrace her daughter; but ſeeing the latter averſe to grant the parting kiſs, ſhe was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to comply. Well! my daughter ſaid the baron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, well! that may be granted to a perſon who takes his leave—come, comfort him, that poor traveller: he is, you ſee, ſorry to leave us! Adela obeyed with ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reluctance, and I embraced her trembling.

What is the matter, dear friend, aſked I? Why nothing, anſwered he, my health, which I ſee decline daily, gives me ſome uneaſineſs—I feel ſuch depreſſions and palpitations of heart, which robs me of reſt both day and night.

               <p>Duverly made no anſwer to this: he had a relapſe of his melancholy, and I was ſorry to ſee him in ſuch a ſituation; as for his health, having been worſe for ſome time, it was true he had no ſleep, he could not eat, and fell into a ſtate of languor, which would bring on a dangerous diſorder.</p>
               <p>It was not long before it happened. We had now been two months at the houſe of the counſellor, when Duverly was taken ill. The phyſicians who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted upon this caſe gave it as their opinion, that the young man had ſome inward grief which preyed upon him, and if it was poſſible to remedy its influence, his life might eaſily be ſaved. Judge what impreſſion this report made upon me. I who loved Duverly, believed to poſſeſs his confidence! he concealed his grief from me. Ah! my feeling heart could not bear that idea; I was determined to try all poſſible means to get from him that fatal ſecret, and to reſtore him to health, even at the riſk of my life. As I ſat up by him regularly every night, I took the opportunity of a moment when he was calm and ſettled, to addreſs him as follows. Duverly, you will die; you will conceal from me the cauſe of your death—ah! what an outrage to my heart could you pry into it: could you but ſee! entruſt me with your ſorrrows, my dear Duverly; entruſt me with

               <p>Mrs. des Roches made me alſo the confidant of many other circumſtances: the moſt pleaſing to me was to hear that Roſina came every day quite alone to ſee her, and ſtaid for whole hours.

"Ah my Roſina, what a blow!"—"Cruel indeed, Duverly, but I am under the controul of a mother, and ſhe muſt be obeyed." She muſt be obeyed! Conceive Dorance, only conceive my grief! Your father then requeſted me to accompany you to Paris: I could not reſiſt his deſire; I ſet out, but I leave you to think, whether I would not have preferred ſtaying at Grenoble! my rival was not there; I might have been a whole year with my charming Roſina, I would have been at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſee her every day at Mrs. des Roches'; Ah how happy would have been my lot!"

I I would not, by delivering my true ſentiments, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate my friend's ſuffering condition. He then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as follows:</p>

               <p>When he had done ſpeaking, I remarked ſuch fire in his eyes, as made me ſenſible that it was not ſeaſonable then to give him advice. Nevertheleſs he ſtood in need of the beſt of advice; for, what could be the aim of his paſſion for an object which was unknown to me? and that Mrs. des Roches, who made themſelves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to ſo ſhameful an intrigue; Oh, that charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was odious and indignant to me. Nay, had I known that my Adela was the object in queſtion; that the letter which had been read to me was from Adela; that the colonel and pretended rival was myſelf—great God, what would have become of me! but his fable was ſo well conceived, ſo well diſguiſed; and as yet, he had ſpoke ſo ill of Miſs Myrſange, that I thought ſhe could not be the perſon. I had even not the leaſt idea of it in my mind; and, had I not explained it, my children, you would not have gueſſed better than I did then. As to Mrs. des Roches, ſhe was no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Duverly, as he gave out, but one of theſe v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mrs. des Roches was a woman of ſecond hand principles, willing to ſerve in all intrigues the intent of which did not, to a certain point affect her delicacy.

               <p>All theſe particulars, my children, I unluckily heard but long afterwards; but I was obliged to expoſe them to you, in order to ſhew how much I have been deceived.

               <p>"My friend," ſaid I to Duverly, "your ſituation is very cruel! you are now ſenſible that love is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly controuled, and you can no longer blame me for harboring that paſſion, for adoring, I ſay, the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Adela, in ſpite of your wife perſuaſions, and the faults you find in her." "Do you love her ſtill?" ſaid he, with a kind of emphaſis—"Yes, you do, I feel it but too well! and, although this objection of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection would never have made any impreſſion upon me, yet, as you obſerve, love knows no controul! My dear friend, you ſee I am not in a condition to write; will you favor me to write the anſwer to this letter?

               <p>Duverly uſed his utmoſt endeavors to ſign his name in a legible manner: I then folded up and ſealed the letter, when he deſired me to put upon it the following direction:</p>
               <p>"A Madame, Madam des Roches, Rue Perrierre, Grenoble."</p>
               <p>One might have ſaid the balm of comfort had been poured into his breaſt: his eyes became a little ſerene, his cheeks fluſhed with the blooming tokens of health, and he preſſed my hand in a manner expreſſive of ſentiment. "My friend," ſaid he, "This is not the only favor I have to beg of you. It is in your power to reſtore me to life; but you muſt pledge your word of honor to perform what I ſhall require. Suffer me to return to Grenoble: I ſhall hide myſelf; I ſhall ſee my Roſina and be happy!

I will even ſend letters for him, and which you will encloſe in your own. My friend, reſtore me to life, as it will coſt ſo little.</p>
               <p>This project excited my indignation, which I expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a plain refuſal. Had you but ſeen the traitor weep ſigh and ſupplicate! he even fainted; and I was afraid it would be his laſt. "Wretch!" ſaid I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in myſelf, what a paſſion! what a phrenzy! Alas!

he is a madman who muſt be taken care of againſt his own ſelf! But were my father to diſcover him at Grenoble! were he to detect me as an impoſtor!—I expoſe myſelf to his anger! well, I will fall down at his feet, and deſcribe the condition my friend was in: I ſhall confeſs my weakneſs, and he will grant me his pardon. Beſides, Duverly is not my ſlave, he has a right to act as he pleaſes!—And what right have I to hinder him? Well, imprudent as it will be of me, my imprudence will ſave his life, it will reſtore my friend! Yes, Duverly," exclaimed I "Yes, I will do all to ſerve you; only live, and let this be my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward."</p>
               <p>Here the patient embraced me; he wept, laughed, was moved, and fell aſleep. I left him at day break, and jealous of keeping my word, went immediately to carry the letter to the poſt-office.</p>
               <p>Don't you admire my complaiſance? Oh! we are not come to the point yet; you will ſee me act a part—a part that will make me bluſh all my life time: it proves my imprudence and my fooliſhneſs:—but I muſt go on.</p>
               <p>The chevalier got well in about a week. It is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for me to tell you how often, during that time he talked of his love, and the pleaſures he was going to enjoy at Grenoble! At laſt, impatient to wait for his full and perfect recovery, he embraced me and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, informing the counſellor, that he was to take poſſeſſion of a conſiderable eſtate in Auvergne, to which he had ſucceeded by a legal right of inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and that his abſence ſhould not exceed two months at furtheſt.</p>
               <p>"It would be to no purpoſe," ſaid he "for you to inform Mr. Dorance, the father, of my departure; for he, having entruſted me with the conduct of his ſon, might be offended at my loſing ſight of him for ſome time; but he is no longer a child; and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in what houſe, ſir,—in what houſe more reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible than your's could he be?

               <p>A long period of time paſſed, before I heard of him; I received at laſt the following letter two months after his departure:</p>
               <p>"Can you believe it, my friend! I am the happieſt of mortals!

Not a ſoul has ſeen me yet in this town; the houſe of my relation is a real hermitage, and is richly provided with all the ſweets of life.—Here I may enjoy the pleaſure of a walk, in a delightful garden adorned with little woods, and moſt delicious groves.—Groves; can I utter this word without retracing to my mind the happineſs I enjoyed yeſterday!—Durſt I make this avowal to my friend? will his delicacy not be offended? O no, he loves, he muſt excuſe the errors which love makes one apt to commit! Yeſterday, Roſina and I being in one of thoſe groves—they are ſo dangerous!—Love put his blind over the eyes of reaſon; it vanquiſhed the reſiſtance of Roſina, and I obtained a victory—alas! a cruel victory, as it coſt her tears, and me regret! O my friend! lend me all your eloquence to conſole the fair I have ſeduced! Reſtore me my innocence to bring back the alarmed modeſty which I have diſpelled and to re plant a flower which I have nipt in her firſt bloom, in her firſt freſhneſs; Alas! Roſina accuſes me of her misfortune!—How will ſhe dare to offer her hand to a huſband! with what countenance will ſhe kindle the torch of Hymen, having yielded her all to love! This cauſes her deſpair, this brings upon me, on her part, the keeneſt reproaches!—Dorance, my dear Dorance, oh! pity me, write, I crave your advice!—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:030364_0099_0FE5D240188A8438"/>
"I cannot conclude this without ſpeaking of your Adela. They ſay ſhe changes every day in the moſt ſingular manner; and is torn by a grief whoſe ſource is unknown. Her phyſical parts are as much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as her moral ones. She becomes ſluttiſh, pouting, even ill-natured: ſhe ſcolds at every body. There are ſuch ſcenes paſſing between her and her mother! My friend! I cannot blame you for being in love; but if you were not to meet with equal return, oh! how unfortunate would you be! Adieu,—reflect."</p>
               <p>The peruſal of this epiſtle put me to the bluſh, for the part I had acted in this intrigue. "Yes," ſaid I "it is I who am the author of that crime! it is I; had I not conſented to Duverly's ſecret departure, would he have ſeen Roſina, would he have been able to ſeduce her youth and virtue? O imprudent! What have I done?—Would to God, I knew the colonel who is to be her huſband!—I would confeſs my fault, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the blow which his honor has received; in ſhort hinder an honeſt man from being ſo baſely deceived! I ſhall know him; I ſhall tell him; he ſhall hear all, I will have nothing to reproach myſelf with, as having been the inſtrument of the miſery of his life.—What do I ſay!—Vile agent of the moſt ſhameful intrigue, I had rather be ſilent. It behoves me to bury it in the deepeſt oblivion, and repent all my life of a conduct equally diſgraceful to the dictates of honor and virtue."</p>
               <p>I anſwered Duverly's letter, but in the moſt ſerious manner; I made him ſenſible of his wrongs, and the baſeneſs of the part he had made me act. I deſired him to look out for another confidant, and concluded with conjuring him never to mention again an intrigue in which I was aſhamed to have been inſtrumental.</p>
               <p>What effect this ſevere letter had upon him I ſhall not decide. During four months I never heard of him, and at the expiration of that time, I had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to receive a letter from the baroneſs, bringing the bad tidings of my father's death.</p>
               <p>I made the utmoſt diſpatch to Grenoble, where I found every body belonging to my father's family in mourning and conſternation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:030364_0100_0FE5D250EE17ED40"/>
I had only ſome very diſtant relations in that town, and was reſolved to leave it, as ſoon as I ſhould have obtained Adela's hand, which her mother, jealous of the promiſe ſhe had made my father, was always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to grant me.</p>
               <p>I hoped to find Duverly prepared to conſole me, and to ſhare my grief! Judge of my aſtoniſhment when I could not get the leaſt intelligence of him. I went to Rue Perrierre, to that Mrs. des Roches, where I knew he lodged, and to my utmoſt ſurprize, was informed that Mrs. des Roches had left town a week ago, and that the place ſhe had choſen for her reſidence was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. I had not the leaſt doubt of Duverly and his infamous accomplices having carried off the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Roſina, and that the former would not let me know the matter, for fear of incurring my father's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. But, what often puzzled me was, that nobody at Grenoble had known Roſina or her father. Indeed, not knowing the old man's name, I could not make proper inquiries about the family.</p>
               <p>Thus my friend was gone: he had forſaken me; he had broken the firſt ties of our friendſhip! I for ſome time regretted him, but ſoon after conſidering his perverſe morals, I made an effort to forget him, and ſucceeded; ſo true is it that vice muſt be hateful to honeſt and virtuous hearts, and that with them it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs all other conſiderations.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, I ſaw every day my Adela, who was faithful to the portrait Duverly had drawn of her in his laſt; her mother, however, before whom ſhe conſtrained herſelf, inſiſted on her giving me her hand; it was my father's laſt will; I was determined to receive it; yet without—love! This paſſion weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in me every day, and I acted barely with paſſive obedience to the baroneſs, becauſe I foreſaw the abyſs which threatened my ruin. I often attempted to try Adela's ſentiments towards me, and I found, that though ſhe had no liking to me, ſhe was not againſt accepting my hand. At laſt, being perſuaded to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage on all ſides, when the fatal day fixed for the ceremony was come, I conducted miſs to the alter, and brought her back without joy as without ſadneſs;
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030364_0101_0FE5D2E10515E140"/>
but with a ſentiment of inquietude which I could not account for. Arrived at home, my ſpouſe demanded to ſpeak in private with me and her mother; we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with her requeſt, and ſaw her with ſurpriſe throw herſelf at our feet, and make the following ſingular ſpeech: "Mother, you have forced me to marry this gentleman! you know the ſtruggles I went through, and how often you have rejected me from your boſom; give me, for heaven ſake, time to know him, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his real merit, and to render myſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the tenderneſs he condeſcends to have for me! I only beg leave for two months to retire to Mrs. Reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's, my aunt, at St. Marcellin. There I ſhall have leiſure to deliberate better; there I will do every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to deſerve the affection and love of the man who merits to find more gratitude in me; Oh, my mother, and you, ſir, grant me this favor! I beg it on my knees! Alas, can you deny me?"</p>
               <p>The baroneſs was going to load her daughter with reproaches and threats; but I was ſo moved, the voice of candor appealed ſo loud to my heart, that I thought it would be cruelty to refuſe ſo ſingular a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which was nigh to have affected the life of the unfortunate Adela. Joining therefore my entreaties to her own, we at laſt obtained the mother's conſent. At the ſame time, ſhe loaded her with curſes and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and ſwore never to ſee her again. "Sir," added ſhe, "I have no farther rights upon her: do with her what you adviſe beſt: for my own part, I will no more hear of her; no, no more:—She is the ſcourge of my old age.</p>
               <p>The baroneſs ſuddenly left the room, and would not even ſo much as give her a letter for Mrs. Reigny. I was as much perplexed as my ſpouſe: I ſent a truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſervant with her, ſhe ſtept quickly into the carriage with her woman, and arrived that very day at St. Marcellin. My ſervant returned the next day, with a letter from Adela, in which ſhe thanked me for the permiſſion I had granted her, aſſuring me that a trait ſo generous would never be eraſed from her memory, and that ſhe could already promiſe me the poſſeſſion of her heart.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THE STORY OF DORANCE CONTINUED:</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THUS left a widower on the firſt day of my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, I ſtaid another month at Grenoble, where I had the misfortune to loſe the baroneſs my mother in law. Her daughter's conduct, whoſe notoriety was partly known to her, and perhaps the regret of having forced her to a compliance againſt her inclination, brought upon her a violent illneſs of which ſhe died; neither permitting my ſpouſe to ſee her, nor forgiving her in her laſt moments. Being then tired of Grenoble, I determined to go to ſettle in Paris; but would firſt go to St. Marcellin to ſee my ſpouſe, and to perſuade her if poſſible to accompany me. In conſequence of this, I informed her by a letter of her mother's death, of the deſign I had formed, and concluded with beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her kindly to receive my viſit and to give me her conſent to accompany me to Paris</p>
               <p>Having ſent this letter, I ſettled ſome affairs at Grenoble, and ſet out for St. Marcellin. It is time, my children, to make you acquainted with the conduct of my ſpouſe, and the perfidious Duverſy.</p>
               <p>He had no ſooner heard of my return to Grenoble, than he determined to leave the town that very inſtant, leſt he ſhould excite my ſuſpicion. Moreover, my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was a check to the frequent viſits he paid to the culpable Adela. Much would he have been at a loſs alſo to convince me of his intrigue with the pretended Roſina. Adela, therefore, with Mrs. des Roches and Duverly, having conjointly taken their meaſures, it was agreed that the latter ſhould go to reſide at St. Marcellin, near Mrs. Reigny, a ſiſter of the the baron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, and that Adela ſhould adopt the above conduct with her mother and me. Mrs. des Roches an inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating artful woman, having, at her arrival at St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celin, changed her name, and gave out Duverly for her ſon, and both of them became ſo connected with Mrs. Reigny, that they ſpent whole days in company of each other, and almoſt ſlept under the ſame roof. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela came to increaſe that company, and told her aunt
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030364_0103_0FE5D315018EFCA0"/>
how her mother had forced her to marry a man ſhe did not like, and our tempers being of a contradictory na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in oppoſition to each other, ſhe had obtained leave to ſpend ſome time at her houſe till her repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhould be removed, and ſhe be decided to return to her huſband. The good old aunt, eaſy and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, yielded to all their artifices, and introduced her niece to Mrs. de Ramond (the fictitious name adopted by Mrs. des Roches and her ſon,) as to friends to whom ſhe profeſſed the higheſt regard. Thus theſe contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible wretches carried on their debauchery, even in the eye of a reſpectable aunt, who, far from gueſſing the plot, granted them every liberty of meeting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with one another.</p>
               <p>In ſpite of all this, my letter created ſome confuſion among the criminal triumvirate. Duverly made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate retreat, and my ſpouſe (muſt I tell it!) was in a very advanced ſtate of pregnancy, betook herſelf to bed, and feigned all the ſymptoms of a violent diſorder. I arrived at this juncture, and found the old aunt and the perfidious des Roches by her bed ſide. Alas, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the latter, whoſe face I did not know, alas! the poor little woman, when ſhe heard of her mother's death, ſhe was ſeized with a fever and phrenzy. My mother is dead, ſaid ſhe, and ſhe died loading me with curſes and imprecations! Oh heaven! can one be more unfortunate! In vain her aunt, my ſon, and I endeavored to conſole her: nothing, ſir, nothing could avail, but the news of your arrival. Shall I ſee my ſpouſe again! ſaid ſhe, Ah! may he forgive me, and I ſhall die contented.</p>
               <p>At this diſcourſe of the perfidious des Roches, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the bed: dear Adela, ſaid I to my ſpouſe, you know I never intended to tyranize over you! You wiſhed to ſpend ſome time at your aunts, I gave you my hearty conſent. Now, ſince you have no mother, there remains only a huſband, a tender, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful huſband—deign to accompany him to Paris, where he intends to fix his reſidence, and be ſure that the care of conſulting your happineſs ſhall henceforth be his ſole and conſtant ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:030364_0104_0FE59AF005839F00"/>
Adela, affecting a feeble tone of voice, anſwered, that ſhe was highly ſenſible of her wrongs, that ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make amends for them, but intreated my kindneſs to give her three months to indulge her grief at the loſs of the deareſt of mothers, that ſhe aſked ſo much time to ſurrender herſelf to my wiſh. It is no mere indifference which dictates that language! No, no, my dear Dorance, your behavior, your generoſity, impreſſes the moſt forcible conviction of my wrongs; They are great, and will I ever forgive them! De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, dear huſband, depart; in three months you ſhall ſee again Adela, not the unjuſt, ungrateful Adela, who received your hand with dread; but a ſubmiſſive, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſenſible ſpouſe, who will think her life too ſhort, to expiate the wrongs done to you.</p>
               <p>You, my children, will perhaps think, that Adela did not ſpeak the language of her heart: yes, ſhe was ſincere. My gentleneſs, my politeneſs had moved her, ſhe repented of her crimes, and intended to live with me, according to the moſt rigorous precept of decency and probity. It was now the eighth month of her pregnancy, ſhe longed to ſee me gone, ſhe feared to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh her ſhame, and my diſhonor! Alas! how ſhe wept! had you ſeen it, my children, ſhe would have excited your pity. I who was ignorant of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, was moved to ſuch a degree, that I advanced to conſole and to embrace her. No, exclaimed ſhe, puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me back, no, my too reſpectable huſband, I am not worthy! my conduct towards you! Ah! preſerve thoſe tender careſſes for happier times.</p>
               <p>Des Roches, quite motionleſs at this ſpectacle, did not know if Adela had ſpoken ſincerely, acted the part of a ſtage player; the old aunt dropt ſome tears, and was muttering quite low: Hum, poor couple! how loving! how moving they are! my dear nephew! My dear niece!—If Raymond was here!—With this curſed journey he loſt the ſpectacle, a beſt example!—He is a good young man; he will, I believe, have the ſame feelings for his wife: for I will ſee him married, &amp;c. &amp;c. Des Roches beckoned her repeatedly to be ſilent; and would with all her heart have wiſhed her to all the devils. Although I did not know this Raymond,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030364_0105_0FE5D2E6EB0156A0"/>
yet ſhe was afraid I ſhould gueſs him. The guilty are always fearful and trembling leſt the leaſt ſign ſhould diſcover their crimes. They will often ſhow by their anxiety what they are ſo careful to keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</p>
               <p>I ſtaid two days longer at St. Marcellin: my ſpouſe, who had her diſorder at her controul, made haſte to recover, and having left her in good health, I ſet out for Paris, where I arrived and took lodgings in the Rue Grenoble, St. Honore. A month after my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, I received the following letter from Duverly, which to me was no ſmall object of ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>"Will you excuſe ſo long a ſilence, my dear Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when I ſhall have enumerated to you all the cauſes that have occaſioned it? A few days before your father's death. Roſina's father diſcovered my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue with his daughter. After having loaded her with the ſevereſt reproaches, he reſolved to leave Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, and to take lodgings at <hi>Bourg-d'Oyſans,</hi> a place which you know is adjacent to this town. Mrs. des Roches brought me the news: I was thunderſtruck!—The father threatened to kill me wherever he would find me. What could I do? Deſpair almoſt overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered my faculties, I propoſed to my relation to travel, ſhe conſented, and we ſet off. I did not let you know it at that time, I was ſo perplexed! You had forbidden me to mention any thing farther of my amours! Your ſeverity—a ſeries of misfortunes! pardon, I pray, my ſilence: I break it off to conjure you to receive in your houſe a wretched friend, who is ſoon to go Paris to die—to break his heart. My Roſina is to marry the colonel in queſtion; but at this time—ſhe is—dare I tell it you—ſhe is pregnant,—the poor child! I don't know how to act, that her father may not find it out—indeed it drives me mad. Aſſiſt me with your advice, it is the laſt favor of an unhappy friend, who does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his faults, and ſwears never to be guilty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if you ſuffer him to live near you, before your eyes, and fortified by your example.</p>

I peruſed this letter ſeveral times, and pity reſumed her empire in my heart. I was going to let him know that he was welcome to my lodging, but I received a letter from my wife, purporting that her health was perfectly re-eſtabliſhed, and that the three months ſhe had fixed, appeared too long a period to be abſent from me—that ſhe would come to Paris in ſix weeks, and would make it her duty to ſee me happy.</p>
               <p>This letter filled me with joy, and my tranſport had made me forget to ſend Duverly an anſwer. One day when I had juſt thought on him, my ſervant came to inform me that ſome peaſant deſired to ſpeak to me inſtantly. I made him come in, and aſked what he wanted. The ſtranger, without anſwering, deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered me a letter, which I knew to come from Duver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.—</p>
               <p>"Dear Dorance, how will you receive the requeſt of a favor I have to aſk of you! will you render me ſo eſſential a ſervice? Now—I am a father—Roſina is brought to bed of a moſt beautiful little girl! Mr. Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, my friend, went into the country with the old man: He left Roſina to the care of Mrs. Pirlet—During this I ſhall ſay no more—but, after all, that child, it muſt be concealed from the vigilant eye of its grand-father and the colonel, who is expected.—I have but one friend, to him I ſend it—receive it, Dorance, receive the pledge of the moſt tender love!—Give it a name, or if your heart, if your delicacy deny me what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of your humanity, conſign the babe to thoſe aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums open to thoſe victims of its age, whom indigence or jealouſy leave deſtitute! Alas! how happy ſhould I be could you but take care of it till I arrive: which will not be long. O Dorance! remember the ſweet inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of our youthful days! Do all for your friend—may he owe you more than his life—his happineſs!"</p>
               <p>This ſingular propoſal quite affected me. "Where is that poor child?"—"Why, Meaſter, we bring it in an our mare; it is below in that there yard."—"In my yard! good God, what will he have me do with it? Impudent man!"—"Poh!

               <p>I knew not what to do; when a woman entered my apartment; ſhe had a child, which ſhe rudely put into my arms. "There, good gemman, there it is, poor little thing—Can you be ſo barbarous not to take it!" "What, I take it? it is not mine; it is nothing to me." Poor little chicken! it wept, it looked at me; (it was then a fortnight old.) I was touched with pity; I embraced the child. I looked at it. The woman that brought it was a nurſe; I kept her too.—"Meaſter," ſaid ſhe, "'tis a little girl; ſhe ar'nt been chriſten'd though." "Well," anſwered I, "we ſhall give her a name; I will ſtand her godfather, and you ſhall be godmother; but how muſt I go about all this?—what will people think?"—"Nay, anſwered the ruſtic nurſe, "never mind; only take care of a poor forſak'd baby." I followed this advice, and went to the rector of the pariſh, to whom I communicated my adventure, ſuch as it had happened. That worthy prieſt received my avowal with a high degree of ſenſibility; and the child was chriſtene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that ſame night. I gave her the name of Clara Adela Duverly, and had her brought up in my own ſight, becauſe of the treacherous Duverly, who had cauſed me all this trouble. I heard no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for very near ſix years.</p>
               <p>Here Candor's narrative was interrupted by Clara, who threw herſelf in his arms, and, melting into tears, exclaimed, "Ah my father—Ah Sir—I know not what name to give you—I ſee but too well, I am that unfortunate child—O my God!—why did not you reject me—O heaven, what kindneſs, what generoſity." "Yes Clara," replied Candor, "yes, you are the fruit of the moſt ſhameful plot.—You ſee how deſpicable he is, to whom you owe your life; but why ſhould you ſuffer for it?—Alas, your birth is your only crime; how have you expiated it by your ſweetneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to a bar arian who deſerved them not; Oh, hear, hear, and tremble before hand at what I am going to diſcloſe.</p>

After my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from St. Marcellin, ſhe loaded des Roches with the moſt bitter reproaches. "Yes," ſaid ſhe, "yes, perfidious friend, it is you who precipitated me into this abyſs; who is to ſave me now? who will make me worthy of a two generous huſband? O wretched Adela, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Des Roches, quite aſtoniſhed, informed Duverly of this change: the latter flattered himſelf to regain Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's heart; but it was in vain: my ſpouſe, quite inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, threatened to kill him if he ever ſhould attempt to appear before her. The only favor ſhe begged of him was to ſend the child to her huſband at Paris. "I ſhall ſee it," ſaid ſhe, "that unfortunate offspring of my guilt; I ſhall bring it up, and its preſence will always remind me of my error; and point out the conduct I ought to adopt towards the moſt reſpectable and moſt generous of men." Duverly conſented; but he could never prevail on Adela to permit him to come and live with us. That woman, whoſe affection to this wretch was changed into hatred, forbad him preromptorily, threatening to diſcloſe all to her huſband, ſhould he ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be ſo imprudent as to diſturb the peace of their houſe. Duverly, in conſequence having made choice of a nurſe, and a truſty confidante, ſent me the infant as mentioned above; and too much perſuaded of Adela's carrying her project into execution, he voluntarily exiled himſelf without writing to me.</p>
               <p>There was but one thing that puzzled me at Paris; I knew not how to preſent the child to my ſpouſe without exciting on her part, ſome injurious ſuſpicions againſt me. What could ſhe think of the care I took of it?—In this anxiety of ſcruple, I reſolved to ſend her with the nurſe to a village adjacent, when a carriage ſtopped before my door;—a woman comes up—it is

"They are very ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating" cried ſhe, "but how little did I know you! how unjuſt have I been to you! alas! this will be my only torment! yes, my ſtrange, inconceivable conduct will be the torment of my life."—"Forget it, Madam; let us both bury in oblivion our paſt failings.—Ah! did you know my imprudence!"—"Your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, Dorance! no!

But, after all, have that ſatisfaction; and by it, let me prove to you all my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: keep it! keep it I deſire it."—"But, madam, is it juſt to beſtow upon a ſtrange child thoſe neceſſary cares which perhaps it will be neceſſary for us to keep in reſerve? for—"—"I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand you, my dear,—Well, we are rich; and can afford it: her father has forſaken her."—"I know it; he is not in France; his Roſina is married; he can ſee her no more; ſuch is her will—Oh! had you ſeen the repentance of that woman; my aunt and Mrs. des Roches deſcribed it to me in ſuch lively colors, as makes the ſcene ſtill preſent to my view—Let us do all for an unfortunate mother; who will perhaps one day em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and cheriſh the little innocent; and thank <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus ſpoke Adela; and moved as ſhe was, ſhe feigned to put ſo much zeal and diſſintereſtedneſs in the favor ſhe granted, that, ſeduced by her adroitneſs and ſenſibility, I embraced her. I was, however, not much inclined to keep the child in the houſe; but ſo well did ſhe take her meaſures, that I reſolved to the contrary. How captious were her expreſſions! when ſhe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my coolneſs for her daughter; ſhe knew how to move me by a picture of the ſituation of a forſaken child; and, when ſhe had excited my feelings to the higheſt pitch, ſhe expatiated upon the great ſervice I was rendering Duverly: and the deſire to anticipate the ſmalleſt of my wiſhes. She then would call for her little Clara, and taking her in her arms, "Behold, ſhe would ſay, "that poor little innocent creature? How ſhe reſembles her mother: ſhe is the very por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of her—Imprudent Roſina!—I knew her well.

               <p>I had no profeſſion, and was a father: this ſacred title rouzed my emulation. I was informed that the perſon who had purchaſed my father's charge had ſince died, and that the precedency was again vacant. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of occupying a poſt in which my anceſtors had diſtinguiſhed themſelves, I imparted my deſign to my ſpouſe.

Yet, after all, ſhe conſented, and we ſet out. My ſpouſe nurſed her ſon, we took him with us, and went to ſettle at Grenoble; but it was decreed that it ſhould not remain long my abode.</p>

                  </gap>king with gore, into my breaſt.—O unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of men, exclaimed he, wreſting the fatal weapon from my hands. O moſt cruel of huſbands, of fathers! deteſt now your cruelty!—Know all—Adela, this morning came to me, Germain, ſaid ſhe, ſave my life ſave thy maſter.—I have committed a horrid crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I married him. He has juſt been informed of it, the conduct which I have ſince adopted, will not ſuffice to ſhelter me from his juſt reſentment.—Oh conduct me to ſome ſacred aſylum: give me time to diſarm his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?—In vain did I repreſent to her the dangers this proceeding would expoſe me to, her tears, her entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (ſhe was almoſt at my feet;) and having heard that you was in purſuit of us made me comply. I drove her as far as this foreſt, to conceal ourſelves for ſome hours: but believe me ſhe was virtuous with you! Oh! I ſwear, I ſwear ſhe was virtuous.</p>
               <p>Deſpair ſucceeded the moſt poignant ſorrow, I wept bitterly: Dear victims, ſaid I, leaning on the poplar beneath which theſe two deplorable victims were lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ah, could you hear my voice; could I reſtore you to life at the expence of my own!—Juſt God, could you permit a deed ſo black, ſo attrocious? Alas what cruelty, what infernal cruelty.</p>
               <p>Favored by the ſhades of night, Germain and I drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the two corpſes to a neighboring cavern. There I ſat down by them, and ſwore not to leave them to my laſt breath. In vain Germain attempted to make me return to Grenoble; I was deaf to all his intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, and had it not been for the zeal of this faithful ſervant, I would have made away with a life, ſtained by the moſt abominable of crimes. Germain, ſaid I, in a moment of calm, men have betrayed me; I will fly from them, I will inhabit this foreſt; here I ſhall be with my wife and ſon; here, far from all ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intercourſe, I will deplore my crime and family. Germain conſented, he pledged himſelf to keep the ſtricteſt ſecrecy about this dreadful accident, and it was agreed, that, next day I ſhould go to Grenoble,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030364_0115_0FE5D2E9CC305898"/>
to ſettle all my affairs, and to engage a clever and diſcreet artiſt to erect this cottage, of which I myſelf had drawn the plan.</p>
               <p>This hope circulated in my veins like the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious balm: we ſpent that night in the foreſt, and, after having ſet by the remains of two beings ſo dear to me, we ſet out for town, in the ſame poſt chaiſe, which had, the preceeding day, carried my ſpouſe and ſon. I waited immediately upon the Duke de—, then governor of Dauphiny, who was at that time at Grenoble: I informed him, that certain misfortunes, which I could not explain, had determined me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from the world, and for that reaſon I humbly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated his permiſſion and leave to build a retreat in the foreſt of Chamborane. This nobleman, who had known me from my infancy, and loved me much, made uſe of all his rhetoric to diſſuade me from ſo ſingular a project; but finding his advice would be to no purpoſe, he readily granted my requeſt and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it another architect, a man of abilities and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fidelity, who ſeconded my project with the higheſt diſcretion, ſo that the town, and all other adjacent places knew nothing of my undertaking. I ordered the fatal poplar, a witneſs to my barbarity, to be tranſplanted into my garden, and you, my children, know it well; it is to this hour ſtained with blood. Let us now turn our eyes, if poſſible from this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful picture!</p>
               <p>While the cottage and its premiſes were building, I remained in the cavern, which contained the bodies of Adela and Julius. I had them embalmed, and put in a coffin, made of a very hard ſort of wood, lined on the inſide with a kind of pitch, which kept out the air and humidity. It is the very ſame cavern in which Alexis to day ſheltered himſelf from the ſtorm. A ſubterranean paſſage leading from this cave conducts to it, and every night I viſit it to ſhed tears! When the cottage was finiſhed, I procured all the neceſſary furniture which you ſo often ſee, and came to conclude my life within its walls.—I was but too ſure of Adela's innocence: among her papers I found a letter from Duverly dated ſome weeks before the perpetration of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030364_0116_0FE5D2A05C054378"/>
my crime, purporting that he had ſettled five years ſince, in the province of North-Carolina in America, and wiſhed conſtant happineſs might attend her, me, and his little Clara, whom he recommended to her maternal care: from this it appears, that Adela had not ſeen him ſince our re-union at Paris: thus I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated my own ſon on the boſom of his mother!—O inexhauſtible ſource of remorſe!</p>
               <p>It is nevertheleſs a plain fact that the perfidious Duverly intended to diſturb the peace of our family. Why did he ſend Adela's letters, and unveil her crime?—Why would he blacken that unfortunate woman with the moſt odious calumny; why feign to be on his death bed, while it was a mere fiction (as Mrs. Des Roches, by a note, has informed me ſince, that I had no occaſion to trouble myſelf about Duverly, he being ſettled in North-Carolina) although it be true that the fatal letter was not of his own writing, yet he dictated it—it was a trait of blackneſs in that infernal villain to deſtroy my peace and the honor of my ſpouſe. He did it ſeemingly, to be revenged on her, becauſe ſhe had entirely baniſhed him from her preſence. What light could I draw from this chaos of thought!—All my fury, all my reſentment, were kindled againſt Duverly—I conceived the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous project; he has a daughter, ſaid I, ſhe is in my power. She believes I am her father: let her grow in this belief—I will go to ſeek Duverly in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the globe, I will reſtore him his daughter, but when I reſtore her, my dagger ſhall pierce her a thouſand times in his own ſight!—Yes, my wife, yes, my ſon; this is the vegeance decreed to your bloody manes. Duverly, who made me commit the greateſt outrage againſt nature, I will puniſh with the ſame blow.</p>
               <p>I fetched Clara immediately from the convent, to live in the cottage with Germain and me. You have trembled, my children, at the phrenzy which miſled my reaſon. Ah, I bluſh and will be aſhamed of it, all the days of my wretched life: Yes, Clara, behold your benefactor, he only brought you up to be his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim; but now much has your ſweetneſs, your lovely
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030364_0117_0FE5D2B3EDC938D0"/>
temper, diſcomfited his bloody deſign;—ah forgive him! Your father is the cauſe of all my ills; him alone I do charge with all the weight of my hatred; but you ſhall forever be the deareſt object of my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
               <p>Alexis, you have now heard the ſtory of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; they ſeemed to excite your pity, prove it, then, in revenging my crime?—"Upon whom?"—"How can you aſk!"—"O heaven, upon Clara's father!" "has he ever proved himſelf her father? "O God, what a demand! The hand of Clara is the deſtined reward!"—"What do I hear," interrupted the latter.—"What, ſir, are you ſo cruel as to promiſe my hand to the wretch who murders my father?—Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra muſt deſerve to expect of you ſuch ſentiments."—"Who is your father? is it a baſe ſeducer who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored your mother, or is it her true and generous huſband, who received you as his child, who brought you up, and of whoſe misfortunes your birth is the only cauſe?"—"Where am I," replied Clara, "O God! what an abyſs of crimes does ſurround me! am I then born for crimes?"—"Germain," continues Dorance, "this is the period to execute our deſign. Let us ſpill thoſe drops of a blood devoted to my hatred, ſprung from the veins of the moſt inveterate of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies!"—"Away, barbarous ruffians, how dare you?" "Clara," replied Dorance, "be docile, ſecond my wiſhes, ah! I will not have thy life; thou art too dear to me, but leave me my vengeance, leave it me, it is my only treaſure."</p>
               <p>Clara, ſinking under the weight of grief, remained motionleſs, her lovely head hung over her woe-fraught boſom; ſhe was a prey to ſighs and ſobs. The vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive old man laid hold of the hand of Alexis, and ſaid to him: Go, my ſon, and ſeek Duverly all over the world. To-morrow, when dawn uſhers in the freſh morn, thou ſhalt ſet out, and never return to this manſion, but with the traitor's head—his head in hand—mark me: this is my command, this is the will of a friend, who has by his generoſity proved a father to thee!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:030364_0118_0FE5D2A1EF0AA210"/>
Alexis, trembling with indignation, could not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a word: Dorance and Germain riſe, they take the coffin on their ſhoulders, and having given each of the young people a flambeau, they aſcend the ſtairs of the cave, croſs the garden, and let down their noble burden under the great poplar.</p>
               <p>Night, with the thickeſt ſable array, governed the foreſt. The light of the flambeaus having rouſed the birds perching on the neighboring trees, they ſuddenly cleave the air with anxious wings, fluttering a thouſand ſiniſtrous ſhrieks, which were re-echoed inceſſantly by the bird of night.</p>
               <p>Our four hermits having arrived at the great poplar tree; Dorance addreſſes them: Here, ſaid he, here is the place where a deſperate hand plunged a dagger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of a ſpouſe and a ſon!—Here is that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſteel ſtill ſtained with blood; the moſt precious, the moſt innocent blood! O my wife! thy head was lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, againſt the bark of this tree, here thou haſt fallen, thy eyes looked tenderly on me, thou preſſedſt my hand and expired! Wilt thou forgive thy butcher? And thou, unhappy creature, that had ſcarce a vital ſpark: Julius, my poor little Julius, what haſt thou done! Here they are, Clara; behold them, Alexis, in this coffin! They groan, I hear their voice! it calls for vengeance! You ſhall be revenged, ſacred aſhes! God ſpeaks to the heart of Alexis: he arms his hand! Clara herſelf will encounter him to avenge the cauſe of a mother, of a brother, and a generous benefactor! no, it is not thy ſeducer, O moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Adelia; it is not thy ſeducer who gave her life! it is thee, it is from thy boſom ſhe received life! Oh! let her ſee thee! let her hear thy voice from the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low bier!—Be appeaſed unhappy family! Ah! you break my heart!</p>
               <p>The old man threw himſelf upon the coffin. Clara falls down proſtrate, and both utter cries as would have moved the moſt flinty heart! but what became of our young couple, when Dorance, opening the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, expoſed to their ſight two embalmed mummies, covered with wounds? Clara reels and drops ſenſeleſs to the ground: the old man burns ſome incenſe, covers

again the frightful corpſes, and taking Alexis by the hand: every year, ſaid he, we bring hither theſe ſad remains and mourn over them! O Alexis, Alexis, will you diſappoint the hopes of my old age? Take this ſteel, take it: make it pierce the perfidious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly: go, my ſon, the dawn is nigh, take this gold; it will keep you from want, and come back to the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. If I am gone, you will find your Clara, you will find her, ſhe is to give you her hand, it is my will.—Am I? exclaimed Clara, no, never, never!—Alexis, whither will you, my dear Alexis?—To die far from you, replies the latter! Yes, I quit forever an odious abode! O Dorance, it is thus you will enſnare my innocence?—If we puniſh crimes do we ceaſe to be virtuous?—Sigh no more, my dear Clara: never ſhall my hand attempt thy father's life!—Take this my promiſe: young man, interrupted Dorance, where are your oaths? have you already forgot that you pledged your honor?—Ah! give me enemies more entitled to be the objects of my proweſs.—What? ſhould I be a baſe aſſaſſin? Who deſires it! Challenge him to a ſingle bombat, and gain the victory.</p>
               <p>Dorance added a thouſand other perſuaſives, each ſpecious than the other, in order to determine Alexis to eſpouſe his cauſe; but he could not ſucceed. Our young hero had too high a ſenſe of feeling and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to become an inſtrument of crime. Meanwhile Dorance and Germain lowered the draw-bridge, and Alexis left the cottage in ſpite of the cries and tears of Clara, whom the two men detained and carried to her apartment. Alexis ſtill hears her voice, which made his heart bleed. We ſhall leave her for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſee what becomes of our hero upon leaving the cottage.</p>
               <p>He firſt felt an emotion of joy, at ſeeing himſelf thus reſtored to freedom; he ſurveyed, for ſome time the walls of the place, which had, during a twelvemonth, been his abode! A little uneaſy about Clara's fate, he ſat down upon the brink of the foſſe and gave vent to his tears. At different intervals, he heard the ſound of her voice; words unconnected reached his ears—<hi>Tyrants, let me die! Is he then going to murder him? Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,

Were they to compel me to return!—Love yielded to fear; and the horrors which ſurrounded him. His heart was depreſſed, he takes to his heels and runs till he quite loſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She is not his daughter, nay, what ſay I, a man who has a deſign on her father's life, has forfeited all claims to ſo vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous a heart.</p>
               <p>Alexis haſtened over hedges and buſhes, he knew not whither to direct his road, and reflected upon what he ſhould do, when a ſingular noiſe was heard near him under ground. The trees ſhook their tops, an abyſs opens its jaws—heaven, what is he to ſee? What new adventure is he run, to encounter?</p>

                  <p>ADVENTURES INCIDENT TO ALEXIS AFTER HIS LEAVING THE COTTAGE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>O Singular inſtability of things—O wonderful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of human viciſſitudes!—who can explain your nature—who can flatter himſelf to elude your power?—Thus it was not enough of the ſcourges and evils that infeſt the globe; muſt alſo the paſſions of men be added to them? The difference of characters, as viſible as phyſiognomy, are the only ſources of the troubles and diſcord which divide ſociety. The wicked undo the good, and drag them into the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice with themſelves.—Thus my neighbor ſets fire to his houſe and it conſumes mine: ſo muſt I, who am good natured, humane, ſenſible, generous, become the victim of the vices which infect the heart of my friends, my parents, or thoſe on whom I depend.—Dependence is the ſource of a thouſand diſorders. Such a one, born honeſt and virtuous, is hurried into perverſeneſs, becauſe he was compelled, in the courſe of his life, to flatter the vanity of ſots, to be ſubſervient to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the great, and to knock at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he temple of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and at every door which the hazard of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances had placed in his way.—A cloſe tie unites ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſo ſtrongly, that no individual can form a true reſolution without the concurrence of the others. Is it not the combination of circumſtances which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that profeſſion?—It requires only a ſingle word, a ſingle ſtep, a ſingle glance of beauty to overturn all your projects, and make you often take a reſolution quite oppoſite to that which once was the favorite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your ambition. What an inſtability!—What a ſubordination to the laws of events!</p>
               <p>Alexis, whilſt living in the cottage, thought he ſhould never leave it, and flattered himſelf to ſpend a life of peace and tranquility. He who deteſted a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in towns, ſound nothing that could engage him
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030364_0122_0FE5D2D69F8A7298"/>
to return and inhabit them a ſecond time. Yet a ſtranger compels him to it; a ſtranger of a jealous, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and vindictive habit:—He bids Alexis imitate his vices—he will have him to ſhare one half of the venom which infects his heart; he puts the dagger of crimes in his hand, and covers the atrocity to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with the cloak of unſpotted juſtice, and heaven born gratitude. Thus to men ſubordinate, what ſhould be moſt ſacred to them, to the purpoſe of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their paſſions!—Hear the covetous—he finds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lawful reaſons to purſue with jealouſy the objects of his boundleſs appetite—the ambitious exclaim how merit and equity ought to elevate him to the pitch of grandeur—the libertine excuſes himſelf with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his ſenſes—the flatterer pretends the neceſſity of making friends: they are never in the wrong!—vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and juſtice are always the language of their mouths, but how far are they from their hearts!</p>
               <p>Thus Alexis is forced to leave all that is dear to him—a miſtreſs, a place of refuge—in ſhort, he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons all!—forces his inclination, and runs to the world for adventures.—Now behold him alone and ſolitary in the woods; he is dreſt in his former decent clothes; in one hand a knapſack with proviſions, the gift of Germain; in the other a knotty ſtick; his little round hat ſhelters his face from the ardor of the ſun; his brown hair, floating in natural ringlets, hangs about his ſhoulders. He has, indeed, the gold of Dorance, but it is a treaſure which flatters him but little.—How much would he prefer ſimplicity and reſt!—he ſlowly continues his way; ſometimes he turns towards the cottage, now out of view.—His eyes, wet with tears, are lifted towards heaven—It is of heaven he now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects all—it is heaven that will be his guide, and will preſerve his youth from ſtriking upon the ſhoals of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience.</p>
               <p>Let us accompany Alexis in all his travels—let us mark for his fate every concern which a befriended, ſhelterleſs orphan of eighteen muſt neceſſarily excite in ſenſible ſouls!</p>
               <p>Alexis had now left the cottage one league behind him; uncertain what way to take, he ſtrayed at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

when hearing a ſingular noiſe near him under ground, it attracted his attention, and chilled his ſoul with terror. He ſtops—the earth ſhakes—the buſhes, which hide the entrance to a ſubterranean abode, are ſeen to move—a cavern opens—out of it comes a man, pale and bewildered, his eyes ſunk in his head, and covered with thick brows, ſeem extinguiſhed by lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor and diſeaſe—in ſhort, it is not an animate being—it is a ghoſt! a phantom!—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Alexis did not know how to believe the ſtranger's words.—A man of a ghaſtly aſpect, coming out of a cavern in the middle of a foreſt, alarmed his natural miſtruſt. And, ſetting aſide miſtruſt, what traveller is bold enough not to apprehend ſomething at ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a meeting?—Yet, the man was alone, unarmed, proſtrate, his voice was ſweet, and even effeminate; he was ſhedding tears, and imploring our hero's aſſiſtance.—What could make him to be feared?—Alexis was good, ſenſible, generous; he raiſed the ſtranger from the ground, and permitted him to follow him. "Come," ſaid he, "come with me, unhappy ſtranger; but, before you expect my confidence, firſt give me your own and, with the moſt ſcrupulous fidelity, give me a recital of your misfortunes, and what you have been doing in this foreſt"—."<hi>O Santa Maria!

I was five years old, and he intended to make me an Orpheus of the firſt eminence, deprived me of what is more than life to give my voice the power and ſound of a woman's.

This young, rich, and handſome chevalier, was paſſionately fond of muſic, and was highly delighted to hear me ſing. He came every night into my apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and I rehearſed before him the beſt ſongs of our great maſters, accompanying them on the harpſicord, I then taught muſic to Signiora Lauretta Mazarelli, the eldeſt daughter of Signior Mazarelli, deſcended of a noble and wealthy family.

The chevalier had no ſooner ſeen Lauret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, than he fell deſperately in love with her. He made me the confidante of his paſſion, and by dint of intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and preſents devoted me ſo much to his ſervice, that I became the ſlave of his commands. Lauretta, who was alſo dying for the chevalier, having made me the ſame propoſals, I was, in ſpite of myſelf, involved in the intrigue, without either daring or being able to keep out of it, for Signora Lauretta, a woman of an impetuous, ſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

circumſtances which reſulted from it. Lauretta, ſince the arrival of her intended ſpouſe, who was of a more jealous diſpoſition, never left the houſe. She was cloſely watched, and I was the only perſon who had acceſs to her apartment to give her the uſual leſſon. I contrived, in order to get her out of it, a peculiar ſtratagem, which might have turned out very bad for me, had not I made uſe of all the prudence and ſkill I was maſter of.</p>
               <p>Lauretta, by my advice, laid down, and feigned an indiſpoſition. I came to her father's houſe, about ſix in the evening, and, having covered my face with a handkerchief, under pretence of a violent tooth-ach, went up to her apartment. Half an hour after, I went out and told her women, who were in an adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing room, that their miſtreſs was faſt aſleep, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nobody would enter her apartment, and, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf for neglecting to bring an intereſting piece of muſic, I returned, and inſtantly gave my clothes to Lauretta, and went to bed in her place. Lauretta, in this diſguiſe, put her handkerchief over her face, paſſed through the middle of her women, who did not know her again, left the houſe, and ſtept into a poſt chaiſe, which waited, with the chevalier, in ſome adjacent lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtreet. <hi>Bene, Signor, bene</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Well, ſir, well.</note>! Signora was gone, but I was left in the lurch, and to get out of it put me at no ſmall loſs. Half an hour after her elopement, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man entered the apartment, approached my bed, and aſked if I wanted any thing. I had put on the night cap of Lauretta, and, for one who was ignorant of the ſtratagem, it was impoſſible to diſcover the cheat. Alarmed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You muſt admire, Signior, the propitiouſneſs of all the circumſtances.

We admired this beautiful diſtrict, and the proud Apennie, the foot of which we had reached, Enraptured with the freedom they were about to enjoy, both lovers embraced me, and in the moſt flattering terms commended me for my

ſtratagem. Soon after, a poſt chaiſe, much lighter than ours came up with us. A man, quite furious, came out—it is Alforo! "Traitor," cried he to the chevalier, "infamous raviſher! ſurrender thy prey, or thy life!"</p>
               <p>The chevalier alighted, and began a bloody combat with Alforo. During the engagement, four men whom he had brought with him, ſeized Lauretta, who had ſwooned away dragging her with them, and put her into their chaiſe. I flew to her aſſiſtance; Mandeville's ſervants followed my example, and our dexterity had ſuch an effect on our antagoniſts, as to hinder them from accompliſhing their deſign.</p>
               <p>Alforo received a mortal wound from the cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, who, while the former endeavored to join his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, came to defend us, and we put them to flight; but the barbarous Alforo, before his ſtrength left him, plunged his dagger into the heart of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Lauretta. "Die with me, perfidious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man!" ſaid he, "Thou ſhalt not be my rival's"</p>
               <p>The chevalier ſaw the blow, and flew to his miſtreſs; ſhe looked at him, and died!</p>
               <p>"O gods!" exclaimed Mandeville, "O gods! could you permit this?" at theſe words he ran his ſword re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly through Alforo's body; but to what purpoſe? to mutilate a cold and ghaſtly corpſe.</p>
               <p>Oh! what was my ſituation at this dreadful ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle! The very idea ſtill ſhakes my frame! I fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my friend who was going to make away with himſelf, and having wreſted the fatal weapon from his hands, I, with the aſſiſtance of his ſervants, put him into our chaiſe, and drove, with the greateſt diſpatch, from the bloody ſpot. The chevalier was bereft of all his ſenſes: having recovered them, he blamed us for leaving the body of his dear Lauretta; but we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him the dangers which would have attended a ſimilar proceeding, as we might have been caught in ipſo facto, carrying off two dead bodies, whoſe aſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be laid to our charge. Mandeville yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to our arguments; but, during the whole journey he did nothing but weep.</p>

The road we had taken, could certainly not conduct us to France; we therefore changed it, and finally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Provence, where we took the road to Paris.

It was in that delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful retreat we both ſtudied philoſophy, and brought it about by dint of ſtudy and application, to convince ourſelves of theſe two maxims, which ought always to live with their fellow citizens in ſociety.</p>
               <p>All men—But, ſignior, before I enter any diſcourſe with you upon moral ſubjects, I ought to give you an account of my laſt adventures, to remove all ſuſpicions about the manner in which you met with me, and the better to gain your confidence.</p>

One day, walking alone in his garden, and reflecting upon his paſt misfortune, he found, by chance, a piſtol in his pocket. This piſtol had been put in by a ſtupid valet de chambre, who believed he had heard his maſter give him orders to do it. What does it ſignify? ſaid the chevalier to himſelf;—I think on the misfortunes which croſs our life, and now find a piſtol in my pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et—It is perhaps a decree of heaven!—Yes, without doubt, heaven will have me die by this piſtol, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent!</p>
               <p>The chevalier was on the point of blowing out his brains, but the idea of not having made a juſt diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his property, made him return to his cloſet: he made his will, went out, hid himſelf in a wood of his park and lodged the fatal contents of the piſtol in his mouth.</p>
               <p>We heard the exploſion at the caſtle; but thinking the Chevalier was hunting, we minded it no farther. A

                  </gap>ew hours after, the gardener came in, quite frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the report, that he had ſeen his maſter lying on the ground in the wood. We went out in haſte, and found the body of the unfortunate Mandeville welter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his blood.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs what I felt in that cruel moment. I loſt the uſe of my reaſon for a whole month.</p>
               <p>The chevalier had left me a conſiderable ſhare of property by his legacy; I received it, and went to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris to baniſh from my imagination the terrible phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which continually tormented it.</p>
               <p>In the metropolis I ſaw company, and in a little time, ſpent my whole fortune. You will think ſignior, that I ſquandered it away in balls, feaſts, and parties of pleaſure. No, I did not!—I obliged friends, who afterwards proved ungrateful to me; becauſe it was apparently to be ſo. I lent, I gave away to every body, and ſoon found myſelf without reſource. I did not, however, regret the uſe I had made of my property, I ſaid to myſelf, all men are born with wants; my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals expoſe them to me, I beſtow, they take; all this is very natural, but they think themſelves under no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to me; I did not aſſiſt them with that motive.</p>
               <p>Wo to the intereſted man who only ſerves people to render them grateful! but I am myſelf reduced to neceſſity, and they whom I obliged will not aſſiſt me. Well! they are of another way of thinking; it muſt apparently be ſo. Moreover, they hinder me from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they have done. I need but beg for relief, and there is no doubt but I may find ſome feeling ſouls who will open their purſe to aſſiſt me. Oh! ſuch perſons are very rare! and why ſhould there be none? I am born indeed with that ſenſibility; I am the only being of my kind in nature; I will hope, I will wait; I may perhaps find ſome friend.</p>
               <p>Thus I reaſoned; though experience had taught me that I ſhould not have too firm a reliance on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man favor. So much the worſe for them, thought I, if they will not oblige their needy brother, of courſe they deprive themſelves of a moſt exquiſite pleaſure; and ſhould I be ſorry for them? heaven has thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſed them, but to me, it gave a different character;
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030364_0132_0FE59AF193F832A8"/>
ſuch is the order of things; all is intended, all is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged, all is premeditated in nature. We are not the maſters of events, but ſhould take them ſuch as they happen.</p>
               <p>After all, ſignior. I helped myſelf out as well as I could; I ſung, I gained money, and reſolved to make the tour of France, to gain wherewith to return to my country. It was in this wood where I was ſtopped and robbed by ruffians. Having told them I was an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian muſician, and what were the cauſes of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſound of my voice, they reſolved to make me their buffoon, and to take me to their cavern to amuſe them, and to divert their wives, with whom they could ſafely truſt me without danger. It is now a week, ſince I have been in that curſed cavern, ſignior; I did every thing to make my eſcape, but never could find an opportunity till this day.</p>
               <p>My hoſts ſtripped laſt night a rich Jew, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make merry upon the occaſion, began to drink brandy and ſpirituous liquors ever ſince the morning.

                  <p>ADVENTURES INCIDENT TO ALEXIS AFTER HIS LEAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING THE COTTAGE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALEXIS could plainly collect from this converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Carlo was a madman, whoſe head was ſtocked with ſyſtems, one more erroneous than anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. His way of thinking was even deſtitute of ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſolidity: what he ſaid this moment would be deſtroyed by what he ſaid the next; his opinions were ſo confuſed, that none of them were eſtabliſhed. He ſeemed, however, to be endowed with an upright heart. He prayed Alexis ſo humbly to be allowed to keep him company, he promiſed ſo firmly to follow him every where, and to join in mutually working for their ſubſiſtence, that, in ſpite of the remembrance of Dumont's perfidy, the lover of Clara conquered his miſtruſt, and conſented to Carlo's requeſt. It was then he had an opportunity to ſee all the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Italian. <hi>"Santa Maria!"</hi> cried he, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down upon his knees, "<hi>Divina croce di Gieſu, vi ringrazio!</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Divine croſs of Jeſus, I thank you!</note> O good and generous cavalier!—be my friend; be my maſter!—I will forget all my misfortunes.—If you ſhould one day marry, a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which a father's cruelty has deprived me, if you ſhould become a father, I will bring up your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I will carry them in my arms. <hi>O cariſſimi figlio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voli</hi>

This broken compound of languages made Alexis ſmile, while his companion continually lifted up his hands towards heaven, and diſtorted himſelf into a hundred different poſtures.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed a winding of the road, our two tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers deſcried ſeveral men advancing ſtreight towards them. Alexis could not help trembling, but Siocco, who was very ſharp-ſighted, begged him not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, that it was only a detachment of the <hi>cavaliers de marechauſſee,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">A very conſiderable body of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By this time the detachment was rather near, and Sciocco, who had been looking all this time, began to cry out, <hi>"O Dio!</hi> whom do I ſee in the middle o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Alexis at this diſcourſe began to be ſenſible of the danger he was in. They betook themſelves from the highway, but the guards, to whom the ruffian had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Siocco, clap ſpurs to their horſes, overtake them, and ſeize them in the king's name.</p>
               <p>Let the reader judge of our hero's grief: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his innocence; but the guards are inflexible; they load them with chains. The robber, who had betrayed them, inſulted them in the moſt approbrious manner. "Hah! hah! Sciocco;" ſaid he, "the pretty buffoon of our charming company; ſo you find at laſt a comrade?—He is quite a child: he began the buſineſs too ſoon."</p>
               <p>Alexis, overwhelmed with grief, could not utter a ſingle word; tears rolled down his cheeks—he moaned—his eyes were directed towards heaven, and ſeemed to beg for ſome miraculous token of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Sciocco muttered, and ſwore ſolemnly, that neither his maſter nor he was guilty; he related to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

to him, <hi>"Mio caro maeſtro,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">My dear maſter.</note> heaven will have it, it was apparantley to be ſo."</p>
               <p>Meantime four of the horſemen leave the main bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their comrades, who continue their march, and lady hold of the two unfortunate friends without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and drag them to the town of St. Marcellin, which they reached towards ſunſet.</p>
               <p>They were, without any formality, committed to priſon, with the conſolatory notice, to hold themſelves ready for the next day, to undergo an examination, and to be put to the rack.</p>
               <p>Behold Alexis alone, ſhut up in a narrow dungeon next to Sciocco's! Behold him, that unfortunate youth, accuſed of the baſeſt of crimes, confounded with the moſt infamous wretches—What has he done? What fate awaits him?—Ah! it is much to be feared he will ſoon be inclined to believe in predeſtination.</p>
               <p>Alexis, ſtretched out upon the ſtraw, melting in tears, revolved all his former adventures in his mind, accuſed his father, Candor, Sciocco, nay, heaven itſelf! Thus he ſpent more than half the night, when a ſweet voice abated his deſpair, and reſtored a little clam to his ſoul. "Alexis," cried the voice, "are you here? Is this your dungeon?"—"Alas, whoſoever you be, ſave me, make my innocence known!"—"A woman who has ſeen you, and pities your youth, has it in her power to deliver you if you promiſe to be grateful."—"Ay, all my life, all my life!"—"Stop then, be of good cheer," The voice is ſilent.</p>
               <p>Alexis, ſurpriſed at this event, did not know wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he ought to accept of liberty thus offered him. "I may be thought guilty," ſaid he to himſelf, "if I fly daſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardly. O my God! what am I to do? I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I will go. But that woman! what is her motive to deliver me whom ſhe does not know? What intereſt can ſhe have?—Suppoſe it is a ſnare! Ought I to truſt her?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:030364_0139_0FE5D2E0357D8AE0"/>
Alexis was now more tranquil, and waited patiently for the angel of conſolation, who had made his ſorrow ſubſide, when he heard the door of his dungeon open. A young, handſome, and well-dreſt woman, provided with a dark lanthorn, approached him, and laying hold of his hand, ſaid, "Come, follow me, unfortunate young man; I cannot believe you guilty; my heart ſcorns ſuch a ſuppoſition—Oh! did you but know what an impreſſion you have made upon it; but don't let us loſe time." "Oh, moſt generous of women! "cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Alexis, "my friend is as innocent as I."—"Save him; let me be under that double obligation to you!"—"I will, with all my heart; but remember, young man, what I do for you."</p>
               <p>The ſenſible deliverer opens the next dungeon. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis called to Sciocco with a low voice, Dear Carlo, come, we are ſet free."—<hi>Santa Maria!</hi> who can—"—"Hold your tongue, fool; you undo us."</p>
               <p>Alexis was forced to ſtop the Italian's mouth with his hand, as his mad declaration might eaſily have fruſtrated their deſign by a diſcovery. They both fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their benefactreſs, who went up ſeveral ſtairs, opened different doors, and conducted them to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment decently furniſhed, where ſhe ordered them to be ſeated. "Alexis, I will ſave you," ſaid ſhe "and accompany you in your flight: hear only a few words; I am the wife of the keeper of this priſon. My huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band diſliked and ill treated me. I ſaw you yeſterday, and you made a very ſtrong impreſſion upon me.—Let me fly from the man I abhor; and permit me to follow one I—I pity. But promiſe never to leave me."</p>
               <p>Alexis was at a loſs how to anſwer; but Sciocco, whoſe joy was extreme, gave way to his rapture.—Should we leave you, <hi>generoſa dona!</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Generous woman.</note> we! Oh! my maſter and I ſwear forever to ſhew the moſt perfect gratitude, the moſt—"—"That is enough!" broke in the miſtreſs of the jail; "but let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> be gone."</p>
               <p>Alexis had now loſt all his joy. The woman who would leave a huſband to follow him, appeared in his eyes, contemptible: and if he did not expreſs his
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030364_0140_0FE5D2BD17FA4670"/>
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, it was becauſe the great danger into which he ſaw himſelf involved, kept him in ſullen apathy. The woman, who conſidered his ſilence the common effect of natural ſhyneſs, and was ſatisfied with Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occo's anſwer, had riſen to ſet off, but Alexis tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and repented already of his proceedings: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted his dungeon, and would fain have returned to it. He reluctantly followed his guilty deliverer, quite loſt in thought, and deaf to the ejaculations of Sciocco, who whiſpered, "Well, heaven is juſt, <hi>mio cara ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co!</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">My dear friend.</note>—The order of things was in confuſion, but now all is ſet to rights.—What a change! What a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!"</p>
               <p>Our three fugitives deſcended the private ſtairs, which led them into a little lane. A carriage waited for them, they got into it, and drove away. Having travelled two nights and one day, they reached Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, where they alighted at an inn, and reſolved to reſt themſelves for a few hours.</p>
               <p>During the journey this inamorata had aſked Alexis a thouſand queſtions, which he anſwered with the utmoſt ſincerity; but Sciocco in order to ſave Alexis the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a tedious recital, related our young hero's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and how he had met with him in the foreſt of Chambarou. The woman, little ſatisfied with his account, begged Alexis to recount his misfortunes himſelf; he complied, omitting certain particulars, and above all expatiated upon his reſidence in the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and his paſſion for the fair Clara; a paſſion which he ſaid death alone could extinguiſh.</p>
               <p>The keeper's wife, ſurpriſed at this avowal, perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, by the moſt forcible arguments to renounce that paſſion, which in all appearance, could never be crowned with ſucceſs; and in order to affect a change in his mind, ſhe made a plain declaration of her own.</p>
               <p>Alexis could no longer reſtrain his indignation: "What, madam," ſaid he, "you are married, and you dare think of loving me?"—"What of that, my dear? I have always been remarkable for my levity in all the circumſtances of my life. My huſband court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for a week, and tired of being a virgin I marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

him—I took a diſlike to him a month after, and left him—He came ſometimes to ſee me in a convent to which I had retired, and with perſuaſions I returned to his houſe. His conduct to me was very cenſurable and ſcandalous—A fortnight after I ſet off with a young man, as lovely as can be, who, in his turn, left me at Paris, where he had brought me. Thus unable to do better, I returned to St. Marcellin, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to forgive my huſband, who received me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. We have now lived together for ſix long months; and he has vexed me in a thouſand different ways; It was too much for me to bear, to live ſix months with a huſband I hate!—I ſaw you, you took my fancy, and I have ſet you at large."</p>
               <p>"No madame," anſwered he, "if my heart is the reward of the kindneſs you have done for me, I ſhall be ungrateful; I judge ſo by my feelings; you may claim my friendſhip and gratitude, but my love, never." "Traitor, remember your promiſe, and the ſacrifice I made for you! You ſhall love me, or die by my hands!"—"What a fine way of ingratiating one's ſelf! What a woman!"—"You don't know me yet;" an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the jailor's wife, "I am capable of every thing—I ſhall devote you the victim of my rage, not as a traitor, by poiſon, or piſtols, but by facing you in fair combat. Dare to reſiſt a woman!—If you will not requite me, take ſword or piſtol, becauſe I care not for either, and take the field with me!"—"Oh madam, are you in good earneſt?"—"Coward, thou trembleſt! Know that I have been educated to be the ornament of my ſex!—I can as well mount a horſe as fight a duel—I can handle the ſword as clever as any French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But Alexis, Alexis, give me your heart, lovely youth! give it me, and do not leave me to deſpair."</p>
               <p>Alexis, aſtoniſhed to the higheſt degree, was ſtruck dumb. Sciocco alone kept up the converſation with the intrepid amazon; he undertook, by phyloſophical argument, to convince her, that ſhe interrupted the order, and deſtroyed the balance of nature; that a woman ought to keep within the bounds preſcribed to her ſex; and that only by a moſt ſupernatural predeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination ſhe ſhould act the part of a Hect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It was during this converſation that our fugitives entered one of the Foxbourgs of Avignon, and alighted at an inn.</p>
               <p>The jail keeper's wife, quite in a furious fit of amor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tranſport, propoſed that Alexis ſhould either yield to her deſires, or accept a challenge to fight a duel. Sciocco offers to ſtand ground for his maſter. "No!" anſwers the termagant, "No, ſignor, if I fight, it is always with a man."</p>
               <p>This ſcene, in fact comical, appeared in quite a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent light to Alexis. His virtuous heart rejected ſo diſgraceful a connexion.</p>
               <p>But let us return to Clara, the unfortunate Clara, who, upon loſing her lover, is acquainted with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of her birth, and obliged to live with the enemy of her father!—let us enter her very apartment, and ſympathiſe with her.</p>

"Oh!" cried ſhe, "he flies from me to plunge the dagger in the breaſt of him who gave me life!—O cruel Candor! It is you who requires that horrid ſacrifice by the hand of he ſweeteſt and lovlieſt of men!—It makes me tremble ſtill!—The raitor has brought me up with no other deſign than to devote me ſome day to his fury, to revenge in me my father's wrongs!—O Candor, thee I loved, but Dorance I hate, I deteſt. Candor is my benefactor—Dorance my moſt implacable enemy. Good God! what horrors await me! Candor, if he finds that Alexis does not return, will not he ſpill my blood? O heaven, I will prevent it, I will leave this

cottage which has, till now, been dear to me. But how can I eſcape?"</p>
               <p>Clara, determined to leave Candor, and to go every where in purſuit of her lover, invented a thouſand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients to effect her elopement, which reaſon deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by degrees. There was but one that ſeemed prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable.</p>
               <p>After having well deliberated on it, ſhe began, with great trouble, to take off the ſtaple of the lock of her apartment. She then waited till night, which was the moſt favorable time to carry her project into execution. All day long, Candor and Germain endeavored to conſole her, and to prove that ſhe would ſoon ſee her Alexis again. At night Germain came, as uſual, to lock the door; but in vain did he give himſelf that trouble; he turned the bolt of the lock, which having nothing to receive it, could anſwer no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Clara went down ſtairs, and ſtaid till the two old men had deſcended into the ſubterraneous temple. She recollected that Alexis had been led almoſt to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it through a cavern, whoſe entrance was from the foreſt. She had alſo remarked, on the preceding night, the door which led to this ſubterraneous temple. She intended to hide herſelf in the cellar till the two old men ſhould have left it, and to eſcape through that ſame door.</p>
               <p>She deſcended quietly into the temple, the door of which had been left open, and hid herſelf behind a pillar, and was witneſs to all the extravagancies of Candor and his old ſervant. After having offered their complaints to the aſhes of Adela and her ſon, they both retired. No ſooner Clara ſaw them depart, than ſhe opened the door of the ſubterraneous cavern, which ſhe could eaſily effect from within, but, groping in the dark, ſoon found herſelf obliged to ſtop, ſeized with horror and fright.</p>
               <p>She recollected there was in the temple a lamp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways burning before the tomb; ſhe returned with a deſign a fetch it away; but, all on a ſudden, the ſilence of the place, the horror ſhe felt before the dead, brought a thouſand tremendous phantoms to her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. She ſtopped, and kneeled down upon the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030364_0144_0FE5D2C424B68B58"/>
ſteps of the monument; ſhe thought ſhe heard a voice break through the marble which covered the coffin. "Oh! my mother!" cried ſhe, "is it you I hear?—Are theſe the woeful moans of my unhappy mother? Speak, what will you have me do? Do your ſacred manes riſe againſt the project of an imprudent daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? What do you foretell me? What muſt I do?"</p>
               <p>Clara could ſcarce reſpire; her chilled heart beat no longer. A ſword ſtained with gore, a parcel of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers offer themſelves to her ſight. "It is the ſword that flew Adela!" ſhe cried, "and theſe papers ſay, "<hi>Adieu my dear Duverly, come ſoon to join your Adela."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Clara put the bloody ſword and the parcel of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the ſepulchral urn from whence ſhe had taken them. But diſcovering an empty tomb in the corner, it attracted her ſad curioſity upon it ſhe ſees the words: <hi>Unfortunate family! thou ſhalt be revenged.—This tomb is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined for the daughter of my enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though perſuaded that this tomb was erected when the cottage was firſt built, her terrors and apprehenſions were revived again. She took her mother's letters, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lamp, and entered the cavern, through which ſhe purſued her way.</p>
               <p>Thus alone, bewildered 'midſt the ſhades of night, ſhe goes, like Hypermneſtra, in ſearch of her lover. She now leaves the cavern, and enters the foreſt which ſurrounds it.</p>
               <p>Profound darkneſs ſtill maintained the empire of night; the foreſt was all in awful ſilence. The trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Clara ſtrayed in this wilderneſs, with her thoughts on the dangers that threatened her in a place full of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and precipices. She reflected that the light of her lamp might attract ſome of thoſe ruffians, and expoſe her to their cruelty; ſhe extinguiſhed it, and ſet it on the ground. She was determined to return to the cavern to paſs the night, when ſhe perceived, at a great diſtance, a light which the lamp had hindered her from ſeeing before. She turned pale and ſtopped. The light advanced ſtraight towards her, Luckily her preſence of mind did not forſake her; uſed to moſt bodily exerciſes, perceiving a tree, ſhe climed up and ſat down upon a bough.</p>
               <p>

Two men drew near, one holding a lantern, the other a parcel. "Well, <hi>Handofdeath,</hi>" ſaid one, "we have walked pretty well; we are now near the cavern." "I think it is time, Mr. <hi>Breakpate,</hi> to end our journey; it begins to tire my old legs. Theſe two thouſand louis d'ors are d—d heavy! Sit down under this tree." "Mr. Handofdeath, now tell me a little of the ſtory about that man; how the devil, my boy, could you alone rob him of ſuch a load of money?" "Hark'ye and I'll tell ye. I came back laſt night from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery on which my comrades had ſent me, and there was a man riding full gallop upon the highway, with a portmanteau behind him. I felt ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ow of ſpirits and courage, that I hid myſelf behind a tree, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to have a go at him. The moment he paſſed me. I fired my piſtol, his horſe fell, the rider very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally followed, and I fell upon him. Come, my friend, ſaid I, give me what you have got in that bag, and don't be long. "Pray, Mr. Highwayman," ſaid he, "I hope you won't rob another thief!" What do you mean by another? ſaid I. "Why I was a banker," ſaid he, "and am now a bankrupt for a very large ſum. I have about eight hundred thouſand livres in bank notes, and about two thouſand louis d'ors in caſh. I can aſſure you, upon my honor, I ſtole it all! One wolf ſhould not devour another. Pray have pity on your comrade." I could not help laughing at the fellow's ſpeech. "Mr. Banker, ſaid I, you ought to be very thankful for being a thief like me; if you was an honeſt man, I would murder you—but, as I find you are a partner in trade, I have ſome regard for you, by the bye though, you muſt give me a bit of your luck—I want the caſh, and you may keep the papers."—"O heaven!" ſaid he, "what the whole ſum?" Aye, aye, replied I, and be thankful for your good fortune, or I'll—As ſoon as my man found me clap a piſtol to his head, he was in a terrible hurry to unpack the parcel to give it me. I put up with that ſubmiſſion, and gave him the watch word for the other robbers, and away I came. He thanked me very civilly, and made his way on foot. I wou'dn't, d'ye ſee, take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the man; iſn't that conſcience? Now, Mr.

Breakpate, I met you coming along, you aſked me what I had got? I owned it all; but we muſt keep the ſecret between us. Zounds! have we any buſineſs to divide the money among our comrades? Have they help'd to the glory of the day? No! So let's hide the caſh ſome where, go back to the cavern, and when we want it, we know where it is." "That's your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ort, my brave boy!" "Well, where ſhall we hide it." "The beſt way I ſhould think, would be beneath ſome tree, and mark it properly. "Stop, do you know this ſpot well?" "Yes, that I do; there are four high-ways all around, and a path that leads to the old mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's cottage." "O yes, you are right; I have heard ſay the old dunny has got a very pretty daughter!" "Who knows that? as yet we never ſaw any body come out of the place;—Don't you think there would be ſome way to get into their quarters to make booty?" "The devil a booty you'd make; the old fellow lives as a hermit; ar'n't there walls, ditches, and every thing to keep us out?" "So it is quite a ſtrong hold?" "Aye, and a good one, "I'll warrant you,—come don't let's forget our yellow boys;—This is a fine tree; won't it do to protect the caſh?" "To be ſure!" "Come then, bear a hand ſteady to work."</p>
               <p>Handofdeath and Breakpate tore a branch from the tree on which poor Clara ſat. They made a kind of ſtake of the branch, and dug a hole large and deep enough to contain the bag. They accordingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited the money, and covered it with earth; after which they marked the tree with four or five notches, and withdrew, not without having well examined the place and its environs.</p>
               <p>What Clara felt during the converſation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of theſe two villains, may eaſily be judged. What they ſaid about the cottage, had above all, frightened her to an extreme. She was afraid le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She dug out the treaſure with the ſame ſtake they had interred it with; but finding the precious burden too heavy, neceſſity taught her an expedient. She fancied to make it lighter by dividing it. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this notion, ſhe put a certain ſum into her ſhoes, her boſom, and all her pockets. Thus provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe commenced her march. She took her way from certain hints, dropped by the robbers, and her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was pregnant with pleaſing thoughts, and the hope of again meeting with Alexis.</p>

                  <p>ADVENTURES INCIDENT TO CLARA AFTER HER LEAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING THE COTTAGE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE curtain of night was drawn, and Aurora, in bright array, purſuing darkneſs from the gates of the eaſt, uſhered in the bright god: all was awakening all reviving in nature. From all parts the birds tuned their melodies to celebrate the return of day.</p>
               <p>Clara continued cheerfully her road to St. Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, in order to proceed from that city to Valence, where ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to enquire for Alexis. She arrived at St. Marcellin the morning, and ſtopped at the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Here ſhe found the whole town in an uproar concerning the elopement of the jailor's wife with two priſoners. This news was communicated to Clara, who thought it ſcarcely worth her hearing. All her eagerneſs, all her wiſhes, tend to inform herſelf of Alexis. Alexis! anſwered the people. Alexis! yes, you are right, he is one of the thieves.—Is not he a young man, of ſuch an age, of ſuch an appearance? He—He muſt certainly be the man?—the jailor's wife fell in love with him, and they went off together.</p>
               <p>This was more terrible than a thunder ſtroke to poor Clara. She dropped down; her landlady, who relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtory, came to her aſſiſtance.—Pray, my dear creature, do you know that Alexis?—If you do, I
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030364_0148_0FE5D28B76A36188"/>
would adviſe you to get out of the way.—You might be taken up, and get yourſelf into trouble.—Well, madam, I will be gone, not to elude the unjuſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of juſtice, but to quit the fatal place where my friend has betrayed me.</p>
               <p>The landlady could not comprehend her meaning, Clara, forbearing all farther elucidation on the ſubject, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, that very inſtant, the town of St. Marcellin, where every thing ſhe had heard ſtruck her with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She took the road of Aubervive, and rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon all the circumſtances of the report made to her with reſpect to Alexis.—Alexis taken up for a thief—is it credible?—I doubt not but he has been miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for another: but his having eloped with another woman, his having yielded to the propoſals of that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he could know only a few hours—this is aſtonishing.—Could he ſo ſoon forget his Clara?—De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful man! I will renounce, I will forget him, and ſeek ſome corner of the world, where, far from the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I may languiſh out a miſerable exiſtence.</p>
               <p>Clara, though well perſuaded of her lover's infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, perſiſts in her deſign of directing her journey to the capital, where ſhe thought to find her fickle ſwain with his new conqueſt.</p>
               <p>Having ſlept that night at Aubervive, ſhe proceeded the day following, to Vienna. In the courſe of her march, ſhe entered a little remote hermitage upon her right. It conſiſted of a chapel, committed to the care of three capuchins, who were ſo very poor as to be obliged ſometimes to ring the bells as a ſignal of their diſtreſs, and to receive alms from the adjacent villages.</p>
               <p>Clara fell on her knees before the altar, where a prieſt was officiating, and addreſſed her moſt fervent prayers to the maker of all. Soon her pious ejaculations were diſturbed by the remembrance of her misfortunes;—ſhe ſighed, while tears flowed plenteouſly from her lovely eyes.</p>
               <p>A lady of a middling age, and very well dreſſed, approached her—O, Good God, my child! what is the matter?—you weep!—Have you met with ſome mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune?—you have perhaps committed a ſin that cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es remorſe—Yes, madam, I have committed one—a
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030364_0149_0FE5D2C531038BE0"/>
very great one!—Alas, at your age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—but there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for all ſins, my little friend; you muſt obtain it by a ſincere penitence.—I have a ſpiritual director, father Stephen, an upright and virtuous man, open your heart to him, make a confeſſion of all your ſins, and let him, by his holy abſolution, reconcile you to the grace of almighty God whom you have offended—You anticipate my wiſhes, madam—Where is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stephen?—my burdened ſoul pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s to unload it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Alas! my little man, how happy I am! You ſhall ſee him directly! but ſtop here a moment.</p>
               <p>The old lady returned with father Stephen, who ogled much our young traveller. Come, my dear heart, be faithful and ſincere, ſaid ſhe—Father Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, you will come to dine with me to morrow, wo'n't you?—Bring with you that child.—You cannot continue your road to day, my angel; devout this whole day to piety—Let me not hinder you.—What a pretty lad!—what a pity that ſo lovely a ſheep ſhould have ſtrayed from the flock of the faithful. Well, do what is to be done; I will not bid you farewell; come back as ſoon as you have finiſhed; I ſhall wait.</p>
               <p>Clara took the capuchin aſide, and began to acquaint him with her being a woman, A woman! cried the director of conſciences, a woman! pray what is your name?—Clara.—A pretty name!—go on.</p>
               <p>The beloved of Alexis made a general confeſſion of the particulars of her education, her flight, and the perfidy of her friend. The father conducted her from church to the lady's houſe, and gave her on the road the moſt ſalutary advice. My child, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that giddy youth, you muſt give him up; ſo lovely a creature deſerves better ſentiments. Do you know where to go to?—I care not where; it is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to me.—Well, ſtay for a while with the old ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs d'Yrace, that is the lady's name who directed you to me, ſhe is a very ſenſible and charitable woman; it will give her pleaſure to accommodate you at her own houſe; ſtay there: but do by no means reveal your ſex to her; beware telling her that you are a woman in diſguiſe; ſhe is ſo ſcrupulous in point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that it would be much againſt you.—Follow my advice, I am your friend.</p>
               <p>

Clara promiſed not to diſcloſe her ſex to the baron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, and thus diſcourſing, they both arrived at her caſtle. The baroneſs was at the gate, and waited for them with the greateſt impatience. Well, my rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end father, have you purged his ſoul of the ſins which infected it? has it acquired the ſnowy whiteneſs of the lily, and the fragrancy of the roſe?—What is your name, my dear?</p>
               <p>Clara was confuſed; father Stephen anſwered for her. His name is Alexis—and, as the poor orphan is without friends, without ſhelter, I prevailed on him to ſtay for ſome time in your houſe, if you, madam, deign, to receive him.—With all my heart; it gives me great ſatisfaction—Ah! father Stephen, what a concern I feel for this poor youth!</p>
               <p>The baroneſs ſeized her hand, and conducted her to ſee her park, her caſtle, and the apartment which ſhe deſtined for her uſe.</p>
               <p>My dear, ſaid ſhe, you may ſtay with me for life, if you like, it only reſts with you; I ſhall take care to make every thing pleaſing and comfortable; but if your fancy is for the beau monde, you will not find it with me, for I ſee no other company than father Stephen, he is my intimate friend; we have been acquainted with one another ſo long—You will be highly benefited by his converſation.—Yes, madam, replied the friar, I will do whatever lies in my power to divert him, but you will not keep him ſhut up all day long? you will ſend him ſometimes to me, I hope; there is a fine fiſh pond in our hermitage; if he loves angling, he is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to amuſe himſelf; and beſides, my numerous collection of books are at his ſervice too; we ſhall read together in my little cell—what do you ſay to that, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis? Clara thanked them with unfeigned pleaſure, for condeſcending to comfort her in her wretched ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>The baroneſs conducted Clara to the Caſtle; the dinner was ſerved up, and the young pilgrim was plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the old lady and the friar, both ſhewed her the greateſt attention, both felt the ſame intereſt though excited by different motives.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:030364_0151_0FE5D2F4F3BD9B00"/>
At night, father Stephen, who was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the hermitage, retired with a kind of ſorrow, yet not before he made Clara promiſe to come next morning to ſee him in his little cell.</p>
               <p>The baroneſs, who was now alone with the ſuppoſed Alexis, aſked him many queſtions, which he anſwered as well as he could. He was very ſorry to ſee himſelf under the neceſſity of deviating from the truth, and had not the father, when taking leave, expreſsly deſired it, Clara would not have retained the ſecret, and borne a name which at once put her in mind of a lover, and his infidelity.</p>
               <p>Next morning ſhe waited on father Stephen, who longed to ſee her; he ventured to ſqueeze her hand, and to make ſome little advances with regard to the tenderneſs he had conceived for her.</p>
               <p>Clara, who thought no farther, left him full of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem and gratitude. She returned to the caſtle, where the baroneſs addreſſed her pretty near in the ſame terms, yet, with a little more candor and leſs captiouſneſs. She aſked her if ſhe had ever been in love? Clara, ſurpriſed at this queſtion, anſwered in the negative. At theſe words, the baroneſs ſeemed to be out of her ſenſes—She ſighed ſeemed enraptured, embraced her, and painted the happineſs which two ſympathetic hearts ſhould enjoy in a retreat ſo delightful as hers. The paſſion of the old fool roſe to ſuch a degree, that Clara, ſimple and innocent as ſhe was, perceived it, and was much alarmed. She was twenty times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of making herſelf known; but ſubmiſſive to father Stephen's command, had determined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult him upon what conduct he would adviſe her to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt in ſo delicate a juncture.</p>
               <p>She returned next morning to the hermitage, and recounted every thing that had happened. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had never thought his old friend capable of ſuch folly, and who was deſirous of accompliſhing his own deſign upon Clara, ordered her again to conceal her ſex, and to make the moſt vigorous reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the old woman's propoſals. He then touched upon his own feelings, and endeavored to be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit in his language. Clara, ſtill more ſurpriſed at
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030364_0152_0FE5D25CD75C3980"/>
the capuchin, than at the old baroneſs, returned, quite in confuſion, to her temporary abode.</p>
               <p>The baroneſs puſhed the buſineſs much farther that day. The friar came to dinner, took aſide Clara, and made a plain declaration of his love. Clara, being thus teaſed by theſe two hypocrites, took the wiſe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of quitting that dangerous aſylum, and its bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tyranny.</p>
               <p>She was ſo imprudent as to mention her deſign to father Stephen. The capuchin was ſtruck dumb for ſome time, but recollecting himſelf afterwards, he feigned to approve of Clara's project. Yes, my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaid he, you do well; your age, your charms, in a word, every thing in you, had for a time alienated my reaſon, and made me regardleſs of my duty; but now, reſtore me to myſelf, and to my ſacred function! fly, and let me forget you, if poſſible! Beware of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the baroneſs know what you are about to do; who knows but that violent paſſionate woman might detain you againſt your conſent. When ſhe ſhall be taking her nap after dinner, take your things, and ſet out. Mind you do not leave the high road; you are only two ſmall leagues from Lyons; you will be there to night; there you can take poſt, and go wherever you pleaſe. Adieu! my dear Clara! You ſee that I reſign all; the baroneſs would not be ſo reaſonable. Adieu. Alas! how ſorry I am.</p>
               <p>Clara was overjoyed to find the father willing not to interrupt her project; ſhe returned to the caſtle, and dined quietly with the baroneſs. After dinner, the latter, according to cuſtom, laid down on her couch to take a nap; Clara no ſooner ſaw her aſleep, than ſhe walked off with her things, and purſued her read to Lyons. Paſſing through a delightful meadow, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to reſt herſelf at the end of it, and reflect upon what ſhe ſhould do. The baroneſs, ſaid ſhe, when ſhe diſcovers that I am gone, will tax me with ingratitude, and not give herſelf any trouble to run in purſuit of me.</p>
               <p>The ſun began to viſit the weſtern hemiſphere, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle coolneſs pervaded the air, the earth opened her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to receive the evening dew, and the all fragrant

flowers exhaled a thouſand perfumes, when Clara, ſeated on a riſing turf, ſupported her head with one hand, reflecting what to do. She ſat there ſome time, and heard not the rattling of a carriage which ſtopped before her; this put an end to her reverie. A man dreſſed in black came out; it is father Stephen. Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, ſaid he, behold the power of love! I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the deſire of following you wherever you went; I have thrown off my ſacred habit; it is no longer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stephen, but a man enraptured with your charms, and who only wiſhes to live at your feet; let us not tarry: ſtep into this carriage with me; come, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother minute will undo us. Oh, heaven, ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>He immediately pulled a piſtol from his pocket, and applied it to his forehead. Clara ſeized his arm. She was moved, and knew no longer how to behave.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were in this wavering ſituation, they deſcried a carriage amidſt clouds of duſt; it drew near and the baroneſs alighted; ſhe approached, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided them with the keeneſt reproaches. Cruel, treacherous, faithleſs man, cried ſhe, what harm have I done thee, that thou ſhould'ſt carry off my Alexis? he forſakes me, and thou art the cauſe: My Alexis, return with me, return, and bring me not to deſpair.</p>
               <p>The friar looked very fooliſh; Clara bluſhed; and the baroneſs laying hold of one of her arms, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make her get into her carriage. Stephen, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Oh, that will not do, replied the baroneſs, pulling Clara to her ſide, he ſhall come with me; anſwered the monk, pulling her towards him, we ſhall ſee who is to be conqueror.</p>
               <p>Long would this diſpute have laſted, had not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forſeen event moſt propitious to Clara, ſaved her from the rapacity of theſe two vultures, and diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their criminal intentions. Thus heaven, which ſhe

invoked, came to relieve her; and ſent, in her trouble, a deliverer, a comforter, a man who will be forthwith moſt dear to her. Let us make a moment's digreſſion from this ſcene of ſtrife, and return to the identical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis, whom we have left at an inn, with his friend Carlo, and the wife of the jail keeper of St. Marcellin, who propoſed either a criminal intrigue, or a duel.</p>
               <p>The reader may ſee that the hero and heroine of our hiſtory are equally unfortunate, and that both muſt ſtruggle with vicious individuals who make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon their virtue and innocence.</p>

               <p>ALEXIS, quite at a loſs how to get rid of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male tormentor, received from Sciocco, whoſe fancy was ſo fertile in expedients and advice, a plan, by the obſervance of which he might eaſily, and with ſpeed, diſincumber himſelf: Signor, ſaid the Italian, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by flight you will be able to put yourſelf out of the reach of that bad woman, and <hi>per lo fare</hi>

                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Your moſt humble ſervant.</note> Alexis laughed at this ſtrange expedient, and left the conducting of the buſineſs to Sciocco. The latter found means, during breakfaſt, to adminiſter the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy to our Dulcinea with ſuch ſucceſs, that ſhe ſoon after complained of a violent head ach, and fell into a profound ſleep. Alexis and his companion, without loſs of time, repaired immediately to the royal poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>office.—They are aſked to what place they wiſh to go—Where you pleaſe, anſwered they—To Marſeilles?—Yes, to Marſeilles.</p>
               <p>A chaiſe is got ready for them, and they depart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we will not diſturb the ſleeping inamorata, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our two travellers.</p>
               <p>Next morning, they arrived at Marſeilles, and hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lodgings at an hotel ſituated at the entrance of the new town. They were, however, highly embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of caſh. The treaſure of Dorance, which was in the poſſeſſion of Alexis, had been taken from him by the officers of juſtice, when he was committed to jail at St. Marcellin. He was left deſtitute, and his comrade labored under the ſame predicament.</p>
               <p>Sciocco adviſed his friend to make the beſt of his abilities in muſic—Alexis accepted his propoſal. In conſequence, they advertiſe themſelves as muſicians deſirous to perform in a public concert.—There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is granted, a day appointed, two amateurs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and the houſe very full—Alexis performed a concerto on the harpſichord, Carlo ſung a rondeau in Italian, both were applauded, courted, and well paid.</p>
               <p>This <hi>debut</hi> made them bold, and they intended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for a ſecond appearance in public, but a favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble event furniſhed them with another kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were one morning performing ſome muſical <hi>morceaux,</hi> a perſon about forty years of age, and of a wealthy appearance, entered their appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—Let me not diſturb you gentlemen; go on, go on, ſaid he—I ſhould be very ſorry to interrupt you.—Sir, we are too deſirous to know what procures us the honor of ſeeing you.—Well, gentleman, we will ſit

               <p>I am the receiver-general of the farms of this city, and it is in my power to give places to thoſe I wiſh to ſerve—You ſeem to be maſters of your profeſſion—To-morrow each of you ſhall have a place in my office—You may take your function upon you; and as to the ſalary, I pledge my word you ſhall be well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—but I expect a mutual favor of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am in love with a very amiable young lady; you will be ſo good as to inſtruct her in muſic, hiſtory, geography, and all the ſciences you are verſed in; and then you will loſe no opportunity of making her ſenſible of my tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for I have a rival, a formidable rival—I have taken care of the young lady from her infancy to this very day, and my intention is to marry her, if her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ſentiments make her worthy of my choice—You ſee the whole of my propoſal has a lawful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and cannot hurt your delicacy—Whilſt, for one month, you endeavor to obtain her good graces in my favor, I ſhall not appear at the houſe—If ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be my ſpouſe, the nuptials ſhall be celebrated at the expiration of that term—If ſhe rejects my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with obſtinacy, give her this little coffer, locked up as it is now, and ſignify to her that I renounce her forever—I have choſen you, gentlemen, for conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this affair, becauſe your landlord has ſpoke in the higheſt terms of your prudence and honeſty; beſides, I am your neighbor; I live in the court before you—this vicinity will enable me to ſee you daily, to know what impreſſions you have made on her heart and mind—Well, gentlemen, will you ſubſcribe to my offers and propoſals?</p>
               <p>Alexis, who would not truſt the ſtranger, did not know how to anſwer his queſtion; but Sciocco was already ſpeaking, <hi>Si ſignor;</hi>

                  <pb n="154" facs="unknown:030364_0157_0FE59AF3BAC1F248"/>
The receiver general then withdrew. Alexis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided Carlo with a thouſand reproaches for having acquieſced in propoſals of ſo ſingular a nature. What, ſaid he, can you, Sciocco decide ſo freely and without my concurrence? Come, anſwer me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> you know that man or his miſtreſs?—It is, indeed, a pretty function he lays on us; but—it is a matter of marriage, replied Carlo—</p>
               <p>Sciocco was running on, but Alexis took no notice of his fooliſh arguments; he was thinking in what light he ſhould conſider an adventure, which gave riſe to his ſuſpicions, and foreboded nothing good.</p>
               <p>While Alexis made theſe reflections, and Sciocco continued his arguments, the receiver general entered the apartment. Come, gentlemen, ſaid he, let us go—let us ſee the inſenſible Sophia, and may I be indebted to you for the conqueſt of her heart, my gratitude ſhall be boundleſs—But mind, I leave you the little coffer, which you will deliver to her, if ſhe perſiſts in her cruelty—But let us not mention it before the time is come—I deſire either her hatred or her hand. But ſir, ſaid Alexis, why don't you keep the coffer at your own houſe?—you can give it us in due time as well as now. I inſiſt on your having it here, replied the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver—I intend going upon a journey which will laſt five weeks; of courſe, I ſhall not be able to give it you—My friends, I think it is as ſafe in your hands as in my own.</p>
               <p>Alexis would not venture any farther queſtions. They all three left the houſe, entered a ſpacious ſtreet, where the dwelling was ſituated. A governeſs made her appearance, and conducted them to the parlour, where the fair Sophia was amuſing herſelf with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming on the harpſichord. Sophia, ſaid the receiver, you know that I muſt go to Paris; my buſineſs will detain me there for ſome time—As I don't wiſh you to be without occupation, I beg you would be docile to the leſſons which theſe gentlemen will give you; I ſincerely hope to perceive, after my return, that they have operated ſome change in you.</p>
               <p>Sophia made no reply; it is thus you mind what I ſay? cried the receiver—Come, hold up your head,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030364_0158_0FE5D31C93995198"/>
and thank theſe gentlemen—What, are you going to cry? I am tired of your little airs, miſs; and I aſſure you, they ſhall not deceive me any longer—come, give us a ſong, and let us ſee what you can do?</p>
               <p>Sophia, after much begging, and intreating, ſung the following air, and accompanied it on the harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord:
<q>
                     <l>Of a ſwain ſadly mourning his doom,</l>
                     <l>My eyes the laſt anguiſh did ſee!</l>
                     <l>Cruel ſufferings had faded his bloom:—</l>

                     <l>Live happy, he cried, beauteous maid!</l>
                     <l>Think on Hylas, and baniſh alarms;</l>

                  </q>
               </p>

What means this ſong, miſs?—you ſing none but languiſhing ditties—I do not like it—I love gay, merry, and pleaſant airs—Come, come, theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will change all that—will you be attentive to them, Sophia? will you follow their advice? I love you, you know it well—I hope therefore you will make me ſome trifling amends for the pains I have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on your education—Who would have taken care of you Sophia, had not I pitied your fate?—you that was born poor, and bereft of your parents when a helpleſs infant in the cradle? you had no friend but me; Ah, Sophia, why not add to this title another more ſacred and dearer ſtill; a title which would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh my every wiſh? Sophia remained dumb ſtill; but that ſilence, and a motion of her head proved plainly how far ſhe was from granting him that title.</p>
               <p>Alexis and Sciocco were quite loſt in amazement; the receiver almoſt put himſelf in a paſſion and all three retired. You ſee, ſaid the latter, how ſhe hates me. It is becauſe you treat her a little too rudely, replied Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occo. Nay, rudely! that little fly creature has took a lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a giddy young ſpark, by whom I have been nearly knocked down an hundred times. Have you a rival! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have! he formerly had the impudence to viſit her, but ſince I threatened Sophia to ſend her to a convent if he ſhould renew his addreſſes, he has kept out of the way; I doubt not, however, of their meeting
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030364_0159_0FE5D28E478F8430"/>
privately, and keeping up a correſpondence, in ſpite of the vigilance of the governeſs, who is much devoted to my intereſt. Since ſhe has a lover, anſwered Sciocco, were I in your place, and did find him with her, I would give him a ſound drubbing. This is juſt what I mean to do; but let us change the converſation: you promiſe, gentlemen, to uſe your beſt efforts in my behalf, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

What of that, if it be impoſſible to bring her about, I am determined to abandon her; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which is in the little coffer will help her to take ſome reſolution, and I will do my beſt to forget her.</p>
               <p>Sciocco ſpent the day in convincing his friend that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the whole of the matter as highly advantageous to himſelf; but Alexis would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him. Next morning the receiver came to fetch and inſtal them in his office. In the afternoon they gave a leſſon to Sophia, which ſhe took with great careleſſneſs, and ſeeming tokens of diſguſt.</p>
               <p>A few days after Alexis perceived that the young lady had caſt ſome ſentimental glances upon him; he thought it a favorable opportunity to gain her confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to turn the converſation upon the receiver. Sophia, who had thus diſtinguiſhed our hero from his companion, ſqueezed his hand, whiſpering in his ear, Did you but know him, ſir, as I do! he is a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous man! Theſe expreſſions alarmed poor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis; he perceived that the diſcreet Sophia dared not to come to an explanation before Sciocco, and changed the ſubject of their diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The day following, while Sciocco was amuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſinging, and preludi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

How would I bleſs the ſuccouring hand that would free me from his tyranny! I have more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in you than in your friend; Come to night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; the governeſs, who is much attached to me, will let you in. Come, I pray; I will tell you all;

                  </gap> capable of; and when you are perſuaded of his treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and blackneſs, you will repent having known him.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe alarmed Alexis to the higheſt degree; he was all compliance. At night, wiſhing to get rid of Sciocco, he feigned indiſpoſition, and a want of reſt. Carlo wiſhed him a good night, and retired to his own apartment. But Alexis, inſtead of going to bed, put on a cloak, ran haſtily down the private ſtairs, and repaired immediately to Sophia, of whom he expected ſuch elucidations as would enable him to take proper meaſures of conduct with the receiver.</p>
               <p>The governeſs was waiting for him at the door. Sophia and he lock themſelves up in a room, where the perfidious pupil made a thouſand falſe reports to her young maſter, to injure the character of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector. To explain this, it is neceſſary to add, that Sophia, whoſe diſpoſition was the moſt falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, deteſted the man who had always treated her with fatherly regard and affection, and to whoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity ſhe owed numberleſs obligations: carried her perverſeneſs to a ſtill higher degree of cenſure, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by a ſet of mercinary domeſtics, gave daily proofs of the moſt ſcandalous and revolting conduct. She had been in love with a young ſpark, but Alexis had now made a more lively impreſſion upon her heart. She hoped, by tracing a touching picture of her own ſituation, and of the pretended vice of her protector, to ſoften our hero, and engage him ſo far as to elope with her.</p>
               <p>Whilſt Clara's lover, locked up with Sophia, liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the moſt blind and implicit credulity, to the lies of the latter, the receiver, who had paſſed by chance through the ſtreet in which his miſtreſs lived, had ſeen a young man enter muffled in a long cloak. He doubted not but her ancient gallant returned: rage and jealouſy overpowered his ſenſes. Hah! hah! ſaid he, is it thus I am duped? and that deceitful governeſs, whom I conſidered as my ſtouteſt adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent! Well, I ſwear to take vengeance upon the young ſpark, who has offended me ſo often; and, as to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, ſhe ſhall hear of me to-morrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:030364_0161_0FE5D25EF05C2080"/>
The receiver, perſuaded that his rival would ſtay all night at Sophia's, went quickly to Sciocco. Where is your friend? He is aſleep; he is not well. I ſhould be glad to ſpeak to him this moment. 'Tis impoſſible, he has retired to his bed-chamber; he is aſleep. Well, my dear Sciocco, I can't help it, you muſt come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with me, and help me to give a ſound drubbing to my inſolent rival, who has juſt got acceſs to Sophia, that treacherous Sophia! To be ſure, Signior, I am ſorry my maſter cannot be of the party; it would not be worth while to awake him for that; we ſhall do the buſineſs full as well without him; I will ſerve you with the moſt ſcrupulous fidelity.</p>
               <p>The receiver and Sciocco, taking each a good cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, lay in ambuſcade oppoſite Sophia's door, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to wait all night, if required, till the pretended rival ſhould leave the houſe, and fall into their hands.</p>
               <p>Sophia, who had all this while frightened Alexis reſpecting her protector, conjured him to ſave her, to take her with him, and to deliver her from a man whom ſhe hated more than death. It was in vain for Alexis to oppoſe her arguments, Sophia would hear no reaſon. Alas! my friend, ſaid ſhe, that man is capable of ruining me and even you, if he finds it his intereſt; it is a great misfortune for you to have known him, and I am ſtill more to be pitied, if I am conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live with him: Oh! help me, my generous youth! I don't care where I fly ſo I get rid of my ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant! Alexis was ſo much embarraſſed, that he knew not kow to act. He promiſed to think maturely of it, and to give her a deciſive anſwer next day, at the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual hour of her leſſon. Sophia, before he went away, ſhowed herſelf ſo kind to him, as to obtain a complete victory over his will. Alexis, however took his leave, quite moved at what he had been told.</p>
               <p>Well perſuaded that the receiver muſt be a man of the blackeſt character, he took the reſolution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the myſterious coffer, which he had received the morning before. Who knows, ſaid he to himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this coffer does not contain papers, jewels and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles, which might very likely undo me, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Amidſt theſe reflections, he went down ſtairs, left the houſe, and ſhut the ſtreet door after him. He had ſcarcely walked three or four yards, when the two companions ſally forth from their ambuſcade, fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and give him the moſt conſummate drubbing before ever he had time to look about him. Alexis turned round and perceived the receiver and Sciocco<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what becomes of him at that ſight! he dares not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth, and receives, quite mute, all the blows which Sciocco deals on him in a moſt maſterly manner. Had it not been for the interference of two ſtrangers, who put the aggreſſors to flight, Alexis would have fallen on the ſpot.</p>
               <p>Alexis, quite ſore, and ſeverely bruiſed, returned thanks to his deliverers, and crept to his lodgings; went up the private ſtairs, and betook himſelf to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>ALEXIS LEAVES MARSEILLES.—ADVENTURES AT THE INN.—A NEW SITUATION.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALEXIS, who ſuffered great pain, reflected upon this ſad accident. What have I done to that miſerable Italian? what could induce him to make ſuch an attempt upon my life? Oh heaven! on whom can I rely? That curſed receiver has ſurely ſeen me enter Sophia's houſe! he muſt have been kindled with fury; he muſt have fetched Sciocco, who, not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in my apartment, has eaſily given credit to ſome ſtory ſet up by his infamous accomplice: But can he, he that ſeemed to love me, have recourſe to ſuch extremities!</p>
               <p>Theſe were the meditations of poor Alexis; and wounded as he was, he would rather ſuffer death, than requeſt Sciocco to fetch him a ſurgeon. Thus he ſpent the night in groans and complaints. In the morning, Carlo, who thought him faſt aſleep, entered his apartment on his toes. Alexis, trembling at his approach, hid his head under the blankets, to avoid his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight. The Italian, who reſpected his reſt, waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030364_0163_0FE5D2F7A998E148"/>
the receiver, informing him that his dear maſter ſeemed to be much indiſpoſed. Well, we'll go and ſee him, anſwered the latter; but don't let us loſe time.</p>
               <p>They both repaired to the apartment of their unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate victim. What ails you, my dear Alexis, ſaid the receiver, are you not well? No, ſir, I am not; I ſuffer very much indeed! Oh, my God! ſend quickly for the doctor.</p>
               <p>Sciocco diſpatched inſtantly a ſervant of the houſe, and returned to his maſter's bed ſide.</p>
               <p>Why was you not with us laſt night, ſaid Sciocco, you would have helped us to chaſtiſe a certain little gallant. Aye, replied the receiver, I ſaw him enter at Sophia's; fury ſeized my heart; I came to fetch Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occo, and we two gave him ſuch a drubbing with our cudgels, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The phyſician's arrival broke off their converſation. Alexis requeſted to ſpeak in private with the diſciple of Eſculapius. Carlo and his friend quitted the apartment. Clara's lover opened the whole affair to the doctor, whoſe gravity ſeemed to excite confidence Sir, ſaid he at the concluſion, I cannot live with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>utchers!—take me, I pray, take me from them! With plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure! anſwered the doctor—ſhould you like to be brought to my own houſe?—Wherever you pleaſe, ſo I do not ſee my enemies.</p>
               <p>The doctor ſent for his carriage; it arrived, and Alexis got into it, in ſpite of Sciocco's complaints and remonſtrances—which, far from being liſtened to by our patient, only ſerved to redouble his indignation.</p>
               <p>Upon his arrival at the doctor's, he was carried to an apartment, the door of which was kept locked.—Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is was determined to ſee Sciocco no more—he forbad him his premiſes, and earneſtly entreated his hoſt not to introduce him.</p>
               <p>Poor Carlo was much grieved at the faults his maſter finds with him. How can you be ſo unreaſonable, ſaid
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:030364_0164_0FE5D2672C76DBB8"/>
the doctor, you that have put him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſuch a condition?</p>
               <p>After a deal of argument with the doctor, Sciocco diſcovered the cauſe of his illneſs, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to acquaint the receiver with what he had heard. The latter was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of his miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>The receiver, to be circumſtantially informed of the whole, called on Sophia that very moment.—Treacherous woman! ſaid he, I know all—Alexis has ſeduced you; you have both betrayed me!—O heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en! cried Sophia, throwing herſelf at his feet, who could tell you this? I implore your clemency for him; he is not guilty; 'tis me alone! what is he not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Perfidious woman! I have already taken venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him; and, as to you, I renounce you, I deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe you forever! I deſpiſe you too much to take the trouble of puniſhing you! But leave this town; get out of my ſight, for fear of ſome unlucky moment! Begone! ungrateful wretch!</p>
               <p>The receiver frowned once more at the guilty So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, left her apartment, and returned to his houſe. From a remnant of commiſſeration, however, upon her unhappy ſituation, he ſent her the little coffer full of gold; and delivered afterwards to Sciocco, the ſum of twenty-five louis d'ors, to pay his friend's phyſician; commanding him particularly never to reveal the name of the perſon who had done him that favor; he then took leave of Sciocco, ſtepped into his carriage, and departed for Paris;</p>
               <p>In vain Sciocco went hourly to the door of Alexis' apartment; in vain he endeavored to convince the doctor of his repentance and attachment to his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The doctor himſelf made uſe of all his influence in favor of the poor Italian. Alexis remained inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; every repreſentation ſerved only to aggravate his reſentment; Sciocco's crime became only more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial to his irritated mind; he openly taxed him with a deſign to murder him.</p>
               <p>Alexis was ſoon able to walk, and began to think of commencing his journey. Seeing himſelf well recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, he ordered his effects to be brought and wiſhed to
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:030364_0165_0FE5D2FE25ECD108"/>
pay the doctor. It is uſeleſs, ſaid the latter, I am paid. Paid! and who has paid you? That I muſt not tell, ſir; I promiſed to keep that ſecret. It was a fruitleſs attempt of Alexis to plague his memory to remind himſelf of the perſon who had rendered him this ſervice; he ſuppoſed it to be Sciocco; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, remembering the treachery of which he accuſed him, he reſolved to ſet out without either ſpeaking to him, or even ſuffering him to be admitted to his preſence.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this, one fine morning, the ſky be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerene and cloudleſs, Alexis took leave of his hoſts, begging they would not acquaint Sciocco with his departure, and ſet out on his journey to Paris.</p>
               <p>He would not take poſt at Marſeilles, for fear Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occo ſhould find out by inquiries, what road he had taken. The conduct of this friend hung ſo heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he walked quite drooped, and with a world of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>in; tears even guſhed from his eyes.—"Am I not the moſt unfortunate of men! ſaid he to himſelf,—whom can I truſt?—to whom can I have recourſe?"</p>
               <p>He was abſorbed in the moſt profound melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when Sciocco, who had watched for him, threw himſelf at his feet; He embraced, and bedewed them with tears. Alexis ſtarted, and ſtrove to avoid him, but the other hindered him by exclaiming with a moſt woful and contrite tone of voice, Oh, my dear pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron! hear me! forgive me! What doſt thou want, wretch? How dareſt thou to ſhew thyſelf to me after what you have been guilty of? Thoſe blows you mean! Oh! did you but know how often I curſed myſelf for them! I did not think I was ſtriking my good maſter! indeed I did not! Traitor, can you be ſo impudent! By heaven, I did not know you! Who elſe did you think it could be? The receiver is as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as myſelf; he ſaw a man, muffled up in a long cloak, enter Signora's houſe; he took him for the old gallant of the fair one; jealouſy overcame him with rage; he came to me, engaged me to be the joint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his wrath, and intended alſo to make you of the party; but I, who believed you was aſleep, did
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030364_0166_0FE5D31ED7C32528"/>
not chuſe to diſturb you. We ſet out, and find the ſuppoſed gallant, and it happened that the blows, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being the reward of a traitor, fell upon my poor maſter! Now, is it our fault? could we gueſs it was you who was with your ſcholar at an hour ſo unſeaſonable? 'Tis a lie! It is not a lie, ſignior, it is the plain truth; aſk the doctor who cured you; What, did not you and the receiver know me? I ſwear by all the powers, we did not!</p>
               <p>Sciocco dropped many a tear; Alexis, ſeeing him proſtrate at his feet, began to reflect, and accuſed none but himſelf of what had happened: Carlo aſked him with the moſt genuine ſimplicity, My dear patron, won't you tell me what buſineſs you had with the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel at ſuch an hour? What leſſon had you to give her?</p>
               <p>Alexis looked at Sciocco, and held out his hand to him, which the Italian kiſſed with heartfelt tranſports, exclaiming, Do you pardon me, dear Alexis? I think I ought, if you tell me the truth; Alas! I ſee all the fault lays on me! Yes, it does indeed! and on that good natured receiver, who miſtook you for his rival, and inſiſted upon paying the expences of your phyſician! Did he pay my phyſician? He did, ſir.</p>
               <p>Alexis embraced him, and recounted his ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with Sophia. Sciocco ſhewed him plainly how ſhe ſought to enthral him! and Alexis, ſtung with remorſe, could hardly forgive himſelf. They both purſued their road, and longed to ſee Paris, where Alexis hoped to hear of his father and Dumont.</p>
               <p>Since his departure from the cottage, he had gone through ſo many adventures, and ſuſtained ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, as had ſcarcely left him time to think on his dear Clara. Sometimes, however, he would ſhed tears at the remembrance of his parting from this dear object of his love: his imagination repreſented her, as it were, in a ſtate of forlornneſs; he heard her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, her reproaches, and this moving picture quite wrung his ſoul.</p>
               <p>We ſhall only ſtop with our travellers at Vienna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> where they happen to have a very ſingular adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, owing to the miſtruſtful temper of Alexis.</p>
               <p>In the duſk of the evening our two travellers, who
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:030364_0167_0FE5D2FF099E43D8"/>
might have gone a few leagues farther before night, found themſelves ſo much ſpent with the fatigue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of their journey, as to enter an inn with an intent to ſpend the evening, but not to ſleep there all night. They were conducted to an apartment, and ſat down to converſe with one another: ſuddenly they hear a ſtrange noiſe in the room: their door was ſhut, they were alone, and yet they heard ſomebody breathe near them, and a low reſtrained coughing. There is ſomebody in our room, cried Sciocco. Yes, replied Alexis, there is ſomebody hidden.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, they ſearch on all ſides, they open a cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and find a man laying on the floor, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling like a leaf. What buſineſs have you here? ſaid our two travellers, putting themſelves at the ſame time upon the defenſive. Ah! gentlemen, don't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do me! anſwered the ſtranger; I am a wretch, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the juſt vengeance of a man whom I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly ſacrificed; he is now at this inn; I ſaw him come in, and quickly hid myſelf in this apartment, the door of which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound open. You have other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, villain! I tell thee leave this room! Ah! by all that is dear to you, ſave me, extricate me! I am no villain; and if I am guilty of a crime, it is love only that made me commit it. Oh! ſuffer me to ſpend the night with you! you ſhall know who I am—you ſhall have an account of the whole affair! What, ſhould we ſuffer a ſtranger? If you turn me out, you undo me! If my enemy diſcovers me here, my life is loſt! Alas, let me owe you my preſervation generous ſtrangers! deign to keep me for this night; to-morrow, when my rival ſhall be gone, I will go too.</p>
               <p>Sciocco was very willing to befriend the ſtranger; but Alexis, afraid, perhaps not without reaſon, of all the bad conſequences which might have reſulted from harboring a man he had found hidden in his room, would by no means have acceded to his requeſt. In vain Sciocco attempted to prove that it was in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things, and of predeſtination; in vain the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger has recourſe to entreaties and tears. Alexis, who had ſo often been put upon, ſuſpects ſome fraud in the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:030364_0168_0FE5D31F9B9A9EB0"/>
buſineſs, opens the door, and calls the landlord.</p>
               <p>At the noiſe he made, the ſtranger attempted to eſcape; but another appeared before the door of the apartment, who ſtopped him, and cried, Hah! have I found the object of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ury, and immediately thruſt his ſword in his boſom. What became of Alexis and his friend at this ſpectacle of horror! They ſee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy victim fall, and impute his death to none but themſelves; and the houſe reſounded with the cries and complaints of the people who came in crowds. Alexis and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iocco, fearing to be compromiſed in that cruel affair leave the inn, and paſs through the crowds that had gathered round the houſe, and take, with the utmoſt precipitancy, the road to Lyons. Having marched to the diſtance of about three leagues, they are overtaken by two men on horſeback. One of them alighted, and addreſſed them in a moſt furious tone, So, you have been the accomplices of the wretch I have killed?—We!—Yes, you! he was hidden in your apartment. Villain! cried Alexis, fear the due ſearch of that juſtice, thou ſeemeſt to have evaded! Forbear inſulting an unfortunate young man, who will be ſorry all his life time for the crime which he has given thee an opportunity to commit.</p>
               <p>The cavalier and his valet make an attempt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack Alexis and Sciocco with their piſtols, but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſarm them, and begin a pugiliſtic combat, in which the four champions diſplay equal ſtrength and dexterity.</p>
               <p>The night was not very dark, and the battle being fought before a caſtle, made ſeveral perſons come to the windows to be ſpectators to an action moſt ſpirited and vigorous.</p>
               <p>Alexis and Sciocco knocked down their adverſaries, ſuffered them to riſe again, ſet too and worſted them. This ſingular combat would have laſted much longer, had it not been interrupted by a particular accident. It happened that Sciocco, elated with the hopes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant victory, exclaimed, Don't flinch! courage, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis!—Alexis! cried a lady, who was looking out of one of the windows of the caſtle; What, is it he? is it that dear lad? fly to his aſſiſtance!</p>

                  <pb n="166" facs="unknown:030364_0169_0FE5D300641B1E48"/>
That moment, a whole troop of valets, armed with cudgels, leave the caſtle, fall upon the four champions, and ſtrike both the aggreſſors and the aggreſſed. Our two heroes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs.</p>
               <p>Alexis received a blow in his face, which quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured him: the blood flows: he ſtops it with his handkerchief; Sciocco and the valets of the caſtle ſupport him. The ſubſidiary dame arrived, and took him by the hand, and made him enter the caſtle. What, is it you, my dear Alexis? Good God! you will not eſcape from me this time.</p>
               <p>Alexis is ſtruck with aſtoniſhment; he wonders who may be this lady that ſhows him ſuch concern.</p>

               <p>WHILST the ex-capuchin and the baroneſs were thus contending about Clara, a phaeton ſtopt on the high road. The generous ſtranger who was ſitting in it, heard the cries of Clara, and alighted from the vehicle. He advanced immediately with his valet, to the ſpot, where Clara hoped a ſpeedy relief from her perſecutors. What are you doing to this young man, cried he? (The reader will remember that Clara diſguiſed in men's clothes, had made the conqueſt of the baroneſs, under the name of Alexis) What is it to you, anſwers the father? Ah ſir, cried the poor victim, deliver me out of the hands of theſe two people, who will carry me off!—Traitor (ſaid the ſtranger, advancing cloſe up to Stephen's breaſt,) let him go or thy life is at ſtake.</p>

               <p>Clara fell upon her knees before her deliverer, and returns him thanks with the moſt heartfelt expreſſions: her candor and gentleneſs made her own the ſituation ſhe was in.—O moſt generous of mortals! ſaid ſhe, the perſon you have extricated from the hands of her cruel raviſhers is a woman!—A woman!—Yes, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who will ever remember with infinite gratitude the invaluable ſervice you have rendered her.—Alas! my good lady who could?—but pleaſe to ſtep in my phaeton, my age ought to warrant my good intentions, come with me, I am ready to carry you to any place you pleaſe to appoint.</p>

I ſhould ſcorn the leaſt thought tending to the contrary. I ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form firſt of all that my name is Clara. A young man whom I loved, and whom I ſtill do love, in ſpite of his treachery!—What do you love miſs?—I myſelf did love once! perhaps you were unfortunate as me.—Unfortunate, indeed! May I beg you to proceed?—I have left all that is dear to me, to follow Alexis; to follow my lover, and the firſt news I received of him, was of his inconſtancy.—Alexis you ſay is your lover's name, Alexis?—Yes, perhaps you know him?—I do not think it can be the ſame-pray, is he a muſician?—Oh! an excellent one. A handſome young man?—As can be. About nineteen?—Wants but a few

months. He is very mild, ſhy?—'Tis he indeed. Unfortunately deceitful and diſſembling. It cannot be he!—He told me he lived in a foreſt?—Ah! it is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis: you know my lover—ſir, where have you ſeen him?—At Marſeilles, miſs:—alas! his acquaintance has proved very fatal to me. For God's ſake, ſir, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain yourſelf!—How I pity you to love at all, that perfidious—Well?—It will grieve your heart. Oh! ſpeak ſir, pray ſpeak?—He deprived me of my miſtreſs's affections.—Is it poſſible?—Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible; I had an unlimited confidence in him;—him; I introduced him to Sophia; I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to have an eye upon her conduct; the traitor! he falls in love with her; they both unite their cunning to deceive me, and in a nocturnal meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſolve to elope together, to forſake me, to break my heart!—Ah ſir, ſir!—I ſee a young man enter my Sophia's houſe in the dark; I never ſuſpected him to be my friend Alexis! I watch him, in company with another perſon—he comes out of the houſe: I and my companion were armed with bludgeons. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge myſelf upon the unknown perſon, and in the morning am informed that the victim was no other than Alexis.—You cained him? Ah tell me, has he been much hurt?—He was forced to keep his bed a whole fortnight; but it ſeems you pity him my fair Clara, do not all theſe facts carry the ſtrongeſt convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your mind, muſt not he be a villain unworthy to approach a perſon as lovely as you?—Ah! let me reſpire, ſir! So many blows all at once? O Alexis! muſt I hear nothing of thee but thy perfidy! At St. Marcellin, he elopes with the gaol keeper's wife; at Marſeilles he projects an elopement with—O God! what a fickle man! how many miſtreſſes in ſo ſhort a time! Oh! Clara could not fix thy inconſtant heart; I am but too ſenſible of it; my abſence has effaced my image from thy ſoul, which thou ſaid love had engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on it forever!

               <p>Clara thanked the receiver (for it was he) with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, ſweetneſs, and innocence. She then gave a faithful account of her adventures; mentioned her father Duverly, and Candor, deſcribed the cottage, and by all this obtained the entire confidence of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, who was a man highly reſpectable. During this converſation, they arrived at Lyons, where they made a ſtay of ſeveral days, to ſee all that was curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and remarkable in that city. Nothing very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial having occurred in their way from Lyons to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, I ſhall not treſpaſs upon the reader's time with unintereſting details, and enter the metropolis with our two travellers, who alight at the hotel<note n="*" place="bottom">In France, the houſes of noblemen, and perſons in high of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice are diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of <hi>Hotels.</hi>
                  </note>of the marquis de Corſagne, the receiver's friend, who makes a conſpicuous figure in the remaining part of this hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>The marquis was about forty, tall, well made, and amiable. He had ſuffered ſo much by misfortune, that his countenance was overcaſt by a melancholy gloom, which nothing could diſpel.</p>
               <p>Arzelia, marchioneſs de Corſagne, had nearly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her ſeventh luſtre; ſhe had ſtill the appearance of a woman who had been diſtinguiſhed by exquiſite beauty; and though her eyes fluſhed no more with glances of juvenile vivacity, though her cheeks and features had been ſorrowed by torrents of tears, though ſhe had loſt the ſeducing attractives which at firſt ſight captivate the heart, yet her ſoul was refined, her temper gentle, and her mind ingenuous and upright. The loſs of her external charms only helped to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the brilliant qualities of her noble heart. Thus the panting roſe, faded by the ardency of a ſummer's

day, the fickle butterfly approaches, and quickly leaves her for another flower, whoſe full blown charms and ſweet perfumes attract the coquetting inſect; but the prudent bee is not deterred by the decayed appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the queen of flowers; ſhe reverently opens her calyx, ſure to find in it a nectar more precious than the uſeleſs perfume ſhe has loſt.</p>
               <p>The receiver whom we ſhall forthwith denote by the name of Du Monay, had intimated to Clara, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he preſented her to his noble friends, that it would not be proper to acquaint them with her adventures. Much have they ſuffered by misfortune, added he; ſuch a confidence would only ſharpen the edge of their grief; and with regard to the hiſtory of the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to that Alexis who never knew his family, all this appears ſo ſingular, ſo romantic, as might in all likelihood, leſſen the favorable opinion to which your merits lay ſo juſt a claim. Pardon my plainneſs Clara, you have given me leave to ſpeak with the tenderneſs of a father; I ſhall exerciſe the paternal prerogative; nay I do now, and in teſtimony of my friendſhip, I will introduce you to my friends, as my neice, as my brother's daughter; they know that I was to take her with me to Paris, but they know not that ſhe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Clara had not the leaſt objection to make Paris her place of reſidence; yet ſhe regretted the cottage. Many times thinking on Candor, ſhe accuſed herſelf of cruelty and ingratitude, and promiſed to return to a man, who had fulfilled every duty of a parent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her; but the bare idea of what he exacted from Alexis, the vengeance he had meditated againſt Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly, and her ownſelf, his daughter, made her ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhe trembled with indignation, and praiſed the powers above for having reſcued her from a blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty tyrant. Nevertheleſs, ſaid ſhe, to herſelf, one day, Alexis may return to the cottage, and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me there—The queſtion is will he ſeek me? This queſtion I will not decide. But who will anſwer, that this falſe man, not content with having thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted me to all the neglect of ſlighted paſſion, who will

anſwer, I ſay that he will not add barbarity to broken faith. Oh God! that he were to bring with him my father's head!—O heaven!—and ſhould I witneſs it! and ſhould I behold! No; I had rather ſtay in Paris. In my deliverer I have found a real father, and can the friends to whom he means to introduce me, be of an inferior ſtamp? No, I will never leave thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hearts; I will live happy far from my relations; but what ſay I?—Is not the place which gives happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the real boſom of the family?</p>
               <p>This was the wiſe determination of Clara: Arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the marquis' hotel, the porter ſhows our travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers into a beautiful ſaloon, where the marquis was reading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his ſpouſe amuſing herſelf on the piano forte. They no ſooner perceived M. du Monay, than they fly to his arms. It is you, my dear friend ſaid the marquis, it is you? how happy I am to ſee you again.</p>
               <p>The marchioneſs expreſſed no leſs the joy ſhe felt at this meeting, and M. Du Monay laying hold of Clara's hand, preſented her to the noble hoſts. Here you ſee, my neice Clara, my brother's daughter. You have offered me your houſe to receive her; that I make bold to accept your propoſal, there ſhe is; Arzelia, what can be more lovely?</p>
               <p>Clara bluſhed and caſt down her blue eyes: the marchioneſs begs her to be ſeated by her: yes, ſaid the noble lady, yes my dear, I adopt you as my daughter: our friend's niece will find again a father and a moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in us! what a pretty creature! Come modeſt Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, let us ſee thoſe pretty blue eyes; come embrace me.</p>
               <p>Clara flies to the arms of her new protectreſs, who, in conjunction with her conſort, laviſhed the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and affectionate careſſes upon her. Dinner was ſerved afterwards. Clara conquered ſomewhat of her natural timidity: ſhe ſung; the marchioneſs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied her on the piano forte, and the day was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpent in converſation, and the ſweets of friendly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations.</p>
               <p>M. Du Monay who only came to Paris to ſettle ſome affairs, ſet out a fortnight after to Marſeilles, whither his function called him. Previous to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:030364_0175_0FE5D305932FCDE0"/>
he recommended his dear neice to his good friends: but he might have ſaved himſelf that trouble. Clara by her gentleneſs and accompliſhments had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ingratiated herſelf ſo much, that the noble pair abſolutely conſidered her as their daughter.</p>
               <p>Clara ſaw, not without tears, the departure of her worthy friend; and though ſhe was fully aware of the happineſs ſhe would enjoy with her new parents, yet without him, ſhe looked upon herſelf as baniſhed to a deſert. In conſequence, ſhe deſired to ſpeak to him in private. Will you leave us, father ſaid ſhe?—I muſt my dear niece!—Oh! my beſt uncle, how ſhall I be able to endure your abſence?—In obtaining the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the generous hoſts, who will ſoon make you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get me!—No, never! never!—Farewell, Clara. My uncle!—Well!—You go to Marſeilles?—Yes. Have you any commands upon that city?—Oh! none at all—but—go on.—If in caſe he was there, never to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion my name to him!—To whom?—To the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Alexis; did he know where I was I am ſure he would write to me, and I—I would burn his letters. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peruſing them?—Yes, without peruſing them!—Very well, my girl, I underſtand you; I will not even tell him that I know you. O never mind, let him know what you have done for me—your generoſity, your friendſhip do me too much honor to conceal them; Well, let us come to the point! So you will not even let him know you are in being.—Ah you may tell him how happy I am, tell him, tell him—that I think no more on him, and that I am happy—very happy!—Well, I will not forget that—Ah! my daughter! you have not quite got the better of your love.—Me! I aſſure you!—Come good bye my Clara, write to me, and depend always—always upon my parental tenderneſs and affection.</p>
               <p>They parted; Clara was melting in tears; but the marchioneſs who ſurpriſed her in that condition, took her to an apartment, and tried to ſtifle her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by a thouſand little amuſements, which did not fail producing the deſired effect.</p>

                  <p>ALEXIS AND HIS FRIEND LEAVE THE BARONESS' CASTLE.—THE HERMITAGE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIRST of all it will be neceſſary to inform my readers (if they have not gueſſed it already) who was the lady of the caſtle, that could not without enthuſiaſm, utter the name of Alexis. He muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that Clara, by the ſame name, had made a conqueſt of the heart of the baroneſs of Yrace! It was before her caſtle, the battle between Alexis, Sciocco, and the ſtrangers had commenced; and it was that fooliſh old woman, who, upon hearing the name of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> young hero, had, miſtaken him for the Alexis who deſerted from her a few days ſince.</p>
               <p>Alexis ſtops the blood which guſhes from the wound he has received in his face, and the baroneſs not having examined him well, perſeveres in her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and orders him to be put into an excellent bed. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lia, ſaid ſhe to her woman, I could not ſee his wound without fainting! poor child! go and dreſs it—to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow morning I ſhall ſee how he does, and ſhall myſelf bring him his breakfaſt.</p>
               <p>In fact the <hi>femme de chambre,</hi> who had but newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſervice of the baroneſs, goes up ſtairs to Alexis's apartment, and by dint of applications to the patient's face, covered it ſo much, that his noſe, eyes, and mouth, were the only parts left viſible.</p>
               <p>Sciocco, who ſtood by his friend's bed ſide, gaped with aſtoniſhment; and though he did not know the motive of all this, yet he failed not to attribute it within himſelf, to the order of things and predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When every body had left the apartment, <hi>mio caro padrone,</hi> ſaid he, will you ſay now that hazard brought you to this caſtle? I don't know; I have ſomething elſe to think on, Sciocco. And what is that?—What a wretch! does not thy conſcience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030364_0177_0FE5D268047C8F40"/>

But how to truſt the ſincerity of a man hidden in a cupboard?—He had his reaſons for it!—He intreated me in ſo urgent a manner.—My God! it is I who have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him!—What harm could there have been to let him ſtay that night in my room? We would have watched, that is all. Ah! Carlo! what a weight I feel upon my heart! how poignant is my remorſe!—<hi>Dolce, Dolce, Signor!</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Sweet ſir.</note> do not accuſe yourſelf ſo much. Be it as it will, fate had ſome hand in the accident. Well, fate!

O, but I know better, where did he come from juſt now? where did you get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him? have you had any diſpute? who were the aggreſſors?</p>
               <p>The baroneſs would never have put an end to her queſtions; and Sciocco, who plainly ſaw that ſhe miſtook his maſter for ſome other perſon, was at a loſs what anſwer to make, ſo great was his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of being diſpoſſeſſed of his good birth. The ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs, who, for her own part, did not know what to make of Carlo's <hi>jargon;</hi> imagined that he was <hi>non compos mentis,</hi> and the blows he received in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat muſt have diſordered his ſenſes. After ſupper Sciocco returned to our hero's apartment, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the converſation which he had juſt had with the hoſteſs, aſked him what he thought of it. Alexis, who was not framed for falſehood, promiſed, that, on the next morning, he would diſcover himſelf to the baroneſs, and rather quit her houſe than ſuffer her any longer to remain in her miſtaken notions.</p>
               <p>At the break of day the old lady went up to her patient, whoſe face ſhe did not know, on account of the lint applied to it by Julia; ſhe ſat down by him, and addreſſed him in the following words: "So, you ungrateful little man, I have you again in my caſtle. I ought not to feel the leaſt concern for you, ſince you
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030364_0179_0FE5D2C6C0988EB0"/>
behaved ſo ſcandalouſly towards me; but—my indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence—my weakneſs—you know me;—you know well my feeling heart?" Madam, the reception you gave me, puts it out of all doubt: but permit me to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you?—I am not—Come, be of good cheer—what ſignifies that baſhfulneſs; that low voice? Indeed I hardly know you again.—I believe you, madam, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I never had the honor of being known to you.—Ah! you diſſemble; cruel creature! you are ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that fate has brought you to my feet; you mean to—but the artifice is too palpable; I have got thee a gain, little wretch, and never more ſhalt thou leave this place. It is all over, thou art with me for life.</p>
               <p>Alexis, frightened at this menace, was going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, when the baroneſs being informed that ſomebody deſired to ſpeak to her below, ſuddenly left the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was one of her farmers who had come to ſettle ſome accounts with her ladyſhip, which would not ſuffer her to return to her young patient. Scioc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co had exhauſted his whole rhetoric during that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, to convince Alexis that it was very lucky for him to be thus miſtaken for another. Alexis rejected his arguments. His ſuſpicious diſpoſition even made him find in the old lady's conduct, ſome ſecret end, which did not alarm him a little; he imagined that ſhe muſt have ſome violent deſign upon him. If not, ſaid he to Carlo, we are fallen in a den of ruffians. What can ſhe want of me? why does that woman threaten me with perpetual confinement? Oh! I will be free this very night! Is it poſſible you ſhould think ſo, <hi>mio padrone?</hi> Poſſible you ſay! don't you obſerve in the baroneſs and all her domeſtics, an air of ſavage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, an air ſo ſingular?—Why, I believe they look much like every body; only obſerve them, Sciocco. Joke apart, I am not eaſy in this place.—This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother inſtance of the effect of your prejudices, your fears, your ſuſpicions; But let us be ſhort;—why ſhould I be kept here in ſpite of myſelf?—ſuppoſe it is in the order of things. Sciocco, I perceive ſome fatal omens! Come, let us get out of this place.—But, your wound?—My wound, hey?—Only look how dangerous it is?</p>

                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:030364_0180_0FE5D32B72ED8960"/>
Alexis, at theſe words, throws off the dreſſing, riſes and taking Sciocco by the hand, they both deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the garden, walk acroſs it, find a little gate open from the field-ſide, and run as faſt as they can! The ſky became inſenſibly more cloudy, and a thick ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, which, covering the earth, ſeemed to indicate to our travellers a faſt approaching and inevitable ſtorm.</p>
               <p>After having ſtrayed for a while through windings, buſhes, ditches, &amp;c. the moſt vivid flaſhes of lightning rent the eaſtern ſky, and which were ſucceeded by the loudeſt claps of thunder; already ſome little drops of rain, preceded the torrents of hail and ſhowers that were to follow. Alexis and Sciocco continued their march with indefatigable haſte, yet the ſilence, the night, the awful horrors of nature, congealed their frame with involuntary ſhiverings; in vain did they attempt to advance farther in their courſe, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme weakneſs ſlackened their nerves, their knees tottered, they could neither breathe, nor ſupport the weight of their bodies. Well, <hi>imprudente cavaliere,</hi> ſaid Sciocco, you ſee now, to what we have expoſed ourſelves.—What can we do, anſwered Alexis, by way of conſolation, was it not in the natural order of things?—Certainly: but we could have avoided it, had we remained in a houſe where we have been treated with ſo much gentility.—Well, this brings, you over to my opinion.—Not it, indeed; I ſhall always adhere faithfully to my ſyſtem. There are events that cannot be avoided, in ſpite of all our efforts to the contrary; but there are alſo ſome that can be avoided, which we ſeem to ſeek by our imprudence, and which, in order that they may happen, are liable to certain conditions. For inſtance: the ſtorm to which we muſt be expoſed;—Might we not as well have heard it roar in bed at the houſe of the baroneſs, hey?—Go on with your muttering, I think you have great reaſon for it. What can the danger be to you? <hi>Veramente</hi>

Sciocco, terrified at the ſtorm, which was continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſing; began to weep bitterly! in vain, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis tried to conſole him, the Italian is always a ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing; he proteſts that this is the laſt moment of their life, and that both are deſtined to be conſumed by the lightning—Alas! cried he, how have I deſerved to periſh by celeſtial fire!—<hi>Santa Maria, aſcolta la mio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſione.</hi>

               <p>Whilſt the Italian offered up the moſt fervent vows to all the ſaints in paradiſe, the violence of the ſhower forced Alexis to look for ſhelter; and there ſeemed to be a light at no great diſtance from him. Come Sciocco, ſaid he laying hold of his hand, I ſee a place of ſhelter, of propitious ſhelter.</p>
               <p>He ſays, and advancing towards the ſpot whence the glaring of the light proceeded, they diſcover an antique ſtructure, with a little ſteeple on its ſummit. The door is open, and nobody appears—Our two trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellers enter that kind of a hermitage, and ſeeking ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery where for ſomebody to ſpeak to—they call out—Nobody anſwers the call—However, the hermitage appears to be inhabited: a lamp is ſuſpended from the ceiling, and ſeveral rough utenſils are ſcattered about. Alexis ſeemed to perceive an inſcription on the wall; he approaches:—O ſurpriſe!—his name ſtrikes his ſtill uncertain ſight;—Yes, it is Alexis, graved every
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:030364_0182_0FE5D2D1B5A8BD78"/>
where upon ſtone: theſe words, above all, ſtrike him in a ſingular manner:
<q>
                     <l>Should the dear youth, Alexis, alas be no more,</l>
                     <l>I never will ceaſe his fate to deplore:</l>

Every ſearch of Alexis proves fruitleſs, in vain he calls, nobody appears; thunder and lightning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant ſhowers, the terror of Sciocco, in a word, all augments his confuſion; he dares not reſt himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtone, and all he ſees reminds him of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: he gives himſelf up to the anguiſh of deſpair, and floods of tears guſh from his eyes.

               <argument>
                  <p>SCIOCCO RESOLVES TO TURN HERMIT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHY has Heaven, that endowed us with the faculty of the mind, made it ſubject to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different affections? Some are men of parts and not of judgment; others have too much foreſight and penetration; the former are only remarkable for a knowledge ſuited to the moment: the latter are ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, timid, credulous, and become exalted, if time is left them for reflection. So multivious is the caſt of the human mind!—prejudices make it falſe and captious; vanity renders it rediculous; timidity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes its powers; in a word, it is ſubordinate to the peculiarities of all the paſſions that can effect the heart. For inſtance: Alexis and Sciocco are both diſtinguiſhed by the gift of reaſon; but how oblique are their views! One cannot believe in good nature and frankneſs, and is furniſhed with a ſufficiency of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to ſupport his opinion. The other is too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding, too open, too much governed by falſe maxims and erroneous ſyſtems, and his principles are not ill-propped. All that happens to the one, does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him in his ideas; and all that is felt by the other does coincide with his way of thinking; both argue plauſibly, and both are miſtaken.</p>
               <p>O human frailty, how amazing are thy deviations!—Logic, morality, philoſophy, metaphyſics, all theſe high ſciences, are like ſo many perfidious guides, who will only involve the deeper into the labyrinth of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry. He that gives the beſt proofs, is not always he that ſees beſt: learning and eloquence are the only merits which raiſe him above the vulgar. He has uſed his efforts to conſolidate his opinion; he will ever bring you over to his party: but does it imply, that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is the juſteſt?—To illuſtrate this I ſhall adduce no other example than that of the two philoſophers, who ſpoke by turns; one in favor of abſtinence, and the other in favor of high living. A day being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030364_0184_0FE5D26B14AEB550"/>
for each to preach his doctrine; the people faſted on the day they left the former; and, as ſoon as they had heard the epicurean, gave themſelves up to the moſt brutal exceſſes of debauchery.</p>
               <p>Thus every one has a mind of his own, opinions of his own, and a peculiar way of viewing things; the beſt is that which is moſt conſiſtent with equity and reaſon. The man who gives all his admiration to the law of nature, is a man of learning, void of common ſenſe: he that follows and reſpects the civil law, is a philoſopher endowed with upright ſenſe and ſound judgment; yet, notwithſtanding, both are in the right: whence that difference?</p>
               <p>Alexis had now loſt a good deal of his miſtruſt, and if I am allowed to ſay, of his ſuſceptibility. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to live with men, and what is worſe ſtill, to be in want of them, he was ſenſible that he brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf all the misfortunes that had befallen him ſince he firſt left the cottage. The adventure of the drubbing, that of the man killed in the inn at Vienna, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that of the baroneſs, whom he had quitted too precipitately, made him acquire experience, and feel the ſting of remorſe; be it as it will, the receiver at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles whom he ſuſpected ſo much, was the moſt hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and generous man, of which he had ſelf evident proofs. His Sophia was a deceitful creature, whom he had fooliſhly conſidered as virtuous; the ſtranger at the inn neither was a thief nor an aſſaſſin; he had undone him, he had delivered him into the hands of his butcher!—How much did Alexis feel the weight of this crime!—What an inclination had he to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and oblige every body! Perhaps it is to be feared, that the murder has made too forcible an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon him. A miſtruſting character, if it be once corrected by the ſuperior force of example; if it feel too many rude ſhocks, will frequently become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to credulouſneſs and imprudence; extremes are never ſo diſtant as we might ſuppoſe them to be.</p>
               <p>On the other hand he lived with Sciocco, whoſe fooliſh good-nature, whoſe erroneous moral ſyſtem made him often loſe patience: compelled to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030364_0185_0FE5D308C04152A8"/>
his falſe opinions, he inſenſibly loſt his own, and this indignation of the mind has the ſame effect upon him as a wiſe and enlightened Mentor.</p>
               <p>We ſhall go farther with theſe reflections, which muſt be obvious to the reader who has followed my hero in his adventures and errors. If he be ſorry to find faults in him (faults which reſulted from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he was brought up, he will ſoon ſee him gentle, amiable, affable and judicious; but he muſt be taught a little more in the ſchool of adverſity, before he can reach that end.</p>
               <p>We have left him with his good friend Carlo, in the middle of a ſtormy night both ſheltered in a kind of a deſolate hermitage, where they ſee nobody; but where a thouſand inſcriptions on the walls, demonſtrate plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the hermit knows Alexis.</p>
               <p>However, the anchorite does not appear! Has he left his aſylum, is he dead, is he hidden in ſome cave? Alexis and Sciocco make the moſt diligent ſearch all over the place; they find themſelves alone, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alone, in the hermitage.—But why was the door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen? Who has lighted the lamp? Their wavering minds were loſt in doubts and conjectures: in ſhort, they are maſters of the place; they may wait till the ſtorm has ſubſided, ſpend the night in it, nay, make it their reſidence as long as they pleaſe. Sciocco propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his maſter to lay down to ſleep upon a bench. Alexis is willing, and they betake themſelves to reſt;—no ſooner had ſleep cloſed their eye lids, than a moſt tremendous peal of thunder made them riſe in a pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic from the arms of Morpheus. Poor Sciocco thinks the frail ſtructure is going to be hurled down—Alexis removes his fears; the Italian commences freſh prayers, and Clara's lover, ſpent with fatigue, cauſed by the ſmart of his wounds, ſoon enjoys a calm and profound ſleep.</p>
               <p>No ſooner dawn had diſpelled the tempeſtuous clouds, than Alexis awaking, and not a little ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſeeing a man in a fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I was going to proceed—it ſeems as if a ſecret voice had whiſpered to me, why doſt thou not inhabit it? Why not ſtay?—I looked around; What do I perceive in this corner? A habit, a pair of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, a cordon; in a word, the complete apparatus of a hermit! think how much I was ſurpriſed: I, who in company with you had ſearched every corner of the hermitage, and could not find ſuch a thing; I had not a moment's doubt, but the habit had fallen from heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en on purpoſe for me.

to continue their way, though they knew not where they were. They go out, not a little ſurpriſed at ſeeing before them a beautiful and ſuperb city, which ſeemed to be no farther than two leagues.

My friend, could you inform us to whom belongs the hermitage upon the right?—To whom, why to you, if you've a mind to have it.—How to us?—Don't you know that the hermit who lived in it, went away ſince yeſterday.—Did he, pray who was he?—A madman, who would have been whipt a thouſand times, had it not been for our attachment to the biſhop who protected him.—Did he ſtay long at the hermitage?—Not he! it is hardly a twelvemonth ſince he firſt ſettled in the place—A twelvemonth! what's his name?—Father—Father—indeed I can't tell you his name, I have forgot it; but hark'ee, if you go to Lyons, inquire for the Dolphin; he uſed that houſe a good deal!—Where is that inn!—Quite near the place of Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court; a child will tell you. Now, as you go there, gentlemen, I wiſh you'll take that there letter to my nephew, the firſt waiter of the houſe:—I would have ſent my wife, but we are ſo buſy, and it will not coſt you much time.

                  <p>THE TWENTY-FIVE LOUIS D'ORS OF JOHN PICOT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THEIR firſt care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon entering the inn, was to enquire for John Picot. John makes his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Sciocco delivers his uncle's letter, and Alexis, always occupied with his hermit, began to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. Oons, anſwered John, he was an odd fellow, that father Hilary; you juſt put me in mind of him; oh! I am very ſorry for him. Pray give me ſome particular account of that man?—Only think, ſir, that father Hilary, who with permiſſion of the Arch-Biſhop, has now been a twelvemonth in the hermitage you have ſeen; did nothing all that time, but lamented one Alexis; for whom he was highly concerned. I heard him often ſpeak of the young man; becauſe as my maſter was a very charitable ſoul, ſent him every day his victuals, and it was I who carried it. "Alexis," he ſaid many times, "Alexis you accuſe me; alas! I am innocent. If you are in diſtreſs, I am ſo too, and perhaps much more than you. What muſt you have thought of my conduct towards you? poor youth, how fond he was of me! how he reſpected me. I ſhall never ſee you again; I am but too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that I ſhall die far from you: ah! what a world of torments!" It was thus father Hilary would always fret. A few days ago, the very Alexis whom he loved ſo much, put up at this inn, with a ſtranger, whom I believe, was his father. At firſt, not knowing his name, I took no notice of him; the young man and his friend, ſtayed here about a ſe'n-night to ſee the city. I attended them to every place curious or remarkable, it was only the day before yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, at the very moment they ſet off, that I heard the old gentleman call the lad Alexis. Alexis, ſaid I Alexis; good God ſhould that be the unfortunate youth whoſe deplorable fate father Hilary ſo often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moans. I waited on father Hilary, and deſcribed the ſtranger—he knew him. "It is he," cried the old man, "It is he; he goes to Paris; I will follow him
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:030364_0191_0FE5D3114C1FDDD8"/>
and find him there;—O ſupreme happineſs! my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly youth, are we to meet again."</p>
               <p>Father Hilary begged me to bring him ſome clothes: I gave him my own; he throws his habit in a corner, dreſſes himſelf in great haſte, thanks me, and takes leave of his abode. "O precious manſion," ſaid he, "floors which I have ſo often ſprinkled with my tears; walls bear a thouſand times the name of my friend, and repeat it on all ſides to my eyes, fare ye well! I quit you, hallowed premiſſes, where I lived far from honors, far from thoſe who have uſed me ill;—Be ever a ſhelter to the erring or fatigued wanderer; receive him, let him find ſhelter under thy ruſtic roof, againſt the ſtorms or heat of the day: ſpeak to his eyes, tell him, that you were the receptacle of an unhappy man, and may this temple, ſacred to friendſhip in deſpair, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ſympathizing viſitors, how ſweet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate it is to be born with a feeling heart."</p>
               <p>At theſe words he lights his lamp for the laſt time, to illuminate once more his hermitage. I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, thee, ſaid he, upon my journey,; the idea of its being uſeful to ſome erring traveller will keep up my ſpirits;—From this you ſee, ſir, that father Hilary was not altogether right in his underſtanding. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he was a good ſoul, and very fond of me. How often would he ſay, young man you fully comfort the afflicted; you will be happy, my friend you will be happy: In ſhort, to ſatisfy your curioſity, I have to inform you, that father Hilary, dreſt as ſimple as I am now, ſet out yeſterday about four in the afternoon, Being too poor to take poſt, he is obliged to perform the whole journey to Paris on foot, and beg alms of the charitable: he hopes to find his Alexis in the capital, and will ſpare no pains to diſcover him. Now, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, is this all you deſire to know? I can give no farther information, as I know no more. Moreover, am I at loſs, about the mutual concerns between the hermit and Alexis; but I find the latter is very ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, oh, very amiable.</p>
               <p>The diſcourſe of John ſurpriſed Clara's lover, in a ſingular manner. Who, ſaid he to himſelf, can be that other Alexis, that overturns all the world like me, and
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030364_0192_0FE5D26DC60B12C8"/>
precedes me wherever I go, for I have not the leaſt doubt of his being the ſame that was with the baroneſs in the caſtle; ſhe miſtook me for him; did there ever happen ſo ſtrange an adventure?—That ſecond myſelf, may be equally unfortunate: Is then our very name the emblem of wretchedneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? Father Hilary—I know nothing of a father Hilary—His language is, however ſtrictly relative to my ſituation. Should it be my father? or what is more probable, my poor friend Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont—Dumont? yes, yes, it muſt be he, it muſt be he, it muſt be Dumont—<hi>Alexis, you accuſe me—poor, poor youth! how fond he was of me!</hi>—It can be no other than Dumont—But that ſecond Alexis, whom Picot deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to him, and in whoſe purſuit father Hilary has gone—My mind is quite confounded in this maze of probabilities. What a cruel enigma, who will clear it up? who will explain it to me?</p>
               <p>Alexis and Sciocco, go up ſtairs to the apartment which has been prepared for them. Next to them on the ſame floor, lived an old man of a very reſpectable appearance; he paſſes and greets his new neighbors, but hearing the name of Alexis mentioned, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches quite ſoftly, to liſten to their converſation. Little by little, penetrated with the moſt lively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern—he enters, and addreſſes our two friends with theſe words: "Excuſe an old man's curioſity, amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrangers, I heard you more than once pronounce the name of Alexis—Don't you know that young man, who was here a few days ago?" Indeed, ſir, this very queſtion we meant to aſk you—I do not know him, and am very ſorry for it. Hear my ſtory, "I have now been three weeks in this inn, and intend leaving it ſoon. The young man we are ſpeaking of, came to live in your chamber, with a ſtranger much older than himſelf. I have ſeen that lovely Alexis, and his aſpect excited a very ſingular ſentiment in me, for which I cannot account—His features put me in mind of thoſe of a woman whom I loved once: It was juſt as if I had ſeen her before me!—The ſame eyes, the ſame mouth, the ſame tone of voice; in a word, Alexis is her living portrait. You judge what I muſt feel at this ſtriking reſemblance. A hundred
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030364_0193_0FE5D2D02CCECB70"/>
times I ſought an opportunity to ſpeak to him; it nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er offered itſelf, and he ſet out without my being able to aſk him a ſingle queſtion. Juſt now, gentlemen, you ſpoke of him, and I could not refrain my curioſity; yet, excuſe me, I am ſenſible of my indiſcretion. I will withdraw myſelf." "No ſir," anſwered Clara's lover, detaining the old man, "no, ſtay—I am as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as you to know that young man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I muſt tell you, he bears my name, and I have now been ſeveral times taken for him." "Methinks you, gentlemen, know no more of him than I do: yet, be as it will, he is an engaging being—Alas! thou whom I adore ſo paſſionately, ſhould it be thee: ſhouldeſt thou return in the form of an angel to charm all mankind?—O how that Alexis ſtruck me; good God, how he ſtruck me."</p>
               <p>It would be doing an injury to the reader's penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to remind him it was Clara, who during her ſtay at Lyons with the receiver, and always going by the name of Alexis had created that ferment in the mind of the old man, John Picot, and the hermit. I ſhall therefore dwell no longer on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>This was the converſation which paſſed for ſome time between Alexis, Sciocco and the old man, hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the latter retired, and the Italian going below to order ſome little matters, Alexis was quite alone. A moment after, being deeply engaged in thought, he believed he heard the voice of Sciocco, expoſtulating in a ſpirited ſtrain with John, in an adjoining paſſage. "What," ſaid John, "is your maſter ſo rich as not to be in need of twenty-five louis d'ors?" "Quite the reverſe, <hi>Signor generoſo;</hi> twenty-five louis d'ors, in this preſent moment, would be of the greateſt ſervice to us. Nevertheleſs we intend to-morrow, to demand a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit concert in the city, that will fetch us rather better than twenty-five louis d'ors.". "But pray don't I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate your wiſhes by offering them thus to you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, without any father ceremony?" "<hi>Certamente,</hi> if my maſter had no objection; but I know him; the expedient will vex him, he will never agree to it."</p>
               <p>Here the two interlocutors ſpoke lower, ſo that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis could not hear the end of their converſation but
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030364_0194_0FE5D2D54B675F60"/>
little as he had heard, did not fail to cauſe him ſome inquietude—"What are thoſe twenty five louis d'ors propoſed to Sciocco? How can he take them, he that knows how much I ſcorn obligations? Is it John? How can that lad be maſter of ſuch a ſum; on what terms does he offer it?"</p>
               <p>Already his imagination was ſet to work, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a thouſand ſuſpicions, all without foundation, when Sciocco, who entered, interrupted him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. He thought to ſee Carlo conſtrained and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed—He dares not look at his maſter, who, for his own part examined him, without aſking him the ſmalleſt queſtion. The good natured Sciocco endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to ſpeak; he is unable. Finally while Alexis is walking up and down in the chamber, Sciocco ſeizing the moment when he turned his back, pulls ſomething out of his pocket, and thurſts it carefully into the little bag, which contains their effects. He goes out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with the ſtrongeſt perſuaſion, that what he had done eſcaped his friend's obſervation; yet Alexis had obſerved all; a glaſs reproducing objects, ſhows him Sciocco hiding with anxious care a parcel. What can it be? Alexis wiſhed not to inſiſt upon knowing the cauſe of his friend's embarraſſment, and during his abſence, he ventures to ſearch the bag. This may probably be conſtrued as an act of indiſcretion; but was not Alexis miſtruſting, fearful, and timed? Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occo who, till then, had ſecreted nothing from him, had juſt manifeſted a diſſimulation, which alarmed him. After all, Alexis without deliberation, ſearches the bag, and finds a rouleau of twenty-five louis d'ors, which he had heard mentioned!—Judge of his aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.</p>
               <p>He had ſcarce time to put the myſterious rouleau in its former place, than the little old man, his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, enters the chamber, quite out of breath. Ah, ſir; Ah my neighbor—What is the matter, ſir?—I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Alexis falls down in a ſwoon; the old man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to give him aſſiſtance; he calls out for help; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body

appears. Alexis, by dint of care, brings, back the unfortunate youth, who, not doubting that John and the Italian committed the theft, knew not what to ſay or do in that ſad criſis; nevertheleſs, he is alone with the ſtranger, whoſe phyſiognomy is equally hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and reſpectable! the place; his confidence; and emotion of heart, all encourages Alexis: he throws himſelf at the ſtranger's feet. Sir, O ſir, don't undo him: it is he: Heavens, ſhall I go on! Take this twenty-five, ſir! it is his ſhare; don't undo him!</p>
               <p>The old man was quite at a loſs how to interpret the confuſion of Alexis: ſome words, however take the veil from his underſtanding; What! unhappy young man ſays he, ſhould it be poſſible for you to be guilty? I! O heavens, what I! It is the other, it is the Italian I have with me. How did you know it? Sir, in pity, don't run me down ſo much; I am vexed enough—I am innocent, I declare upon my honor.</p>
               <p>The old man, moved with horror and compaſſion; knew no longer Alexis, the ſtamp of candor and prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is imprinted on the youth's countenance. The ſtranger ſtares at him, tells the five and twenty louis d'ors, which he holds out with a wavering hand, and prepares to aſk him for the accomplice that has the remainder of the ſum, when Sciocco, without the leaſt ſuſpicion enters the room, with an air of gaiety and ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction. Come hither, thou wretch, cried Alexis with a low voice, enter, ſhut the door, and own the vileſt and baſeſt of all crimes! What crime? What crime, villain, replied the old man, ſhaking him by the collar! tell me this moment the name of thy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, or thou art loſt! <hi>Perdio lei Signori,</hi> I don't know what you mean; Ah! thou playeſt the ignorant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous thief! Thief! I am no thief! He dares ſtill to deny the fact! and thoſe twenty-five louis d'ors? They are mine. Thine? To be ſure; John gave them to me. Well, John has committed the theft! But pray, what are you talking of theft? I tell you, John got a prize in the lottery, and gave me that ſum. Very well, reſumed the old man, ſo he got it in the lottery? we ſhall ſee that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:030364_0196_0FE5D332EEE05208"/>
The old man leaves the room; in vain do Alexis and Sciocco uſe their utmoſt efforts to retain him; he is gone. Being thus leſt by themſelves, Alexis, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with grief, loads the innocent Italian with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, the latter falls down on his knees, and ſwears by all the ſaints in Paradiſe that he is innocent. They were both in that cruel agitation, when a great tumult aroſe before the gate of the inn, and completed their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. People call out <hi>ſtop thief! ſtop thief!</hi> ſoon the mob gathers—the thief is taken, brought to the inn, and known for having committed frequent depredations, not without violent ſuſpicion of being guilty of the preſent. At laſt he confeſſes, among other things, to have ſtolen the fifty louis d'ors of the lodger, whoſe room was marked with No. 12. He returns the ſum, it is brought to the old man, who, aſhamed of the affront he had given his neighbors, returns to their chamber, leading by the hand John the waiter, whom he had alſo much inſulted—They embrace each other, the old man begs a thouſand pardons, for his uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble behavior, and John is requeſted to explain to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, this matter, which ſtill puzzled him. He acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf of their deſire as follows:</p>
               <p>You well know that Mr. Sciocco delivered me, this morning a letter from my uncle the farmer: here is that very letter; hear it and judge:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>I cant give you any clever news, but that you have won in the lottery two thouſand four hundred livres. I here return you the policy which you know you left with us. Here it is: go immediately and get your money of the receiver, and remember the prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe you made when you took your numbers! did not you ſay, if I am lucky, I will give the fourth part of my gain to the firſt poor traveller that comes to our inn. Now, d'ye ſee, you have got good luck, ſo keep your promiſe, John; it is to Almighty God, you have made it, and he, you know, does puniſh the faithleſs man. But without all this, an honeſt fellow will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtick to what he ſays. Therefore, I wiſh you well with all my heart, and ſo does your aunt Jacklin.</p>

I did not wiſh my uncle to remind me of my prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe, to fulfil it. In conſequence I went to the receiver, who told me down the ſum, and thinking on you my good gentlemen, I took Mr. Sciocco in private, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him the part I had deſtined for him. At firſt he ſtarted a world of objections, remarking, how his friend's delicacy might be hurt by ſuch a proceeding. But, what occaſion have you, ſaid I, to tell him ſo ſoon, but keep that ſum in ſtore, againſt ſome unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen accident; he liked my notion, and has favored me in accepting the offer. This, gentlemen, is ſtrictly true; yet, I cannot help owning, that this explanation coſts me much, and that I ſhall always have at heart the affront put upon me at this day!—Oh, did my poor uncle know it—It would break his heart.</p>
               <p>Thus ſpoke the honeſt the virtuous Picot, and the Italian, who, on the other hand, was not leſs affected, could not conceive how his <hi>

               <p>The old man could hardly put an end to his excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and offered his purſe, by way of reparation to thoſe he had inſulted. John Picot above all, who ſhed a torrent of bitter tears, had moved the ſieur to ſuch a degree, that he addreſſed him in the following words, with an air of real contrition: Lovely young man, you that deny forgiveneſs, give me but time to manifeſt my repentance? Come with me, be my friend, my confident, and leave me the care to make your fortune—Anſwer me, John, will you ſerve me?—Will you be a ſecond to myſelf? I will offer you no ſalary, my heart and equity ſhall fix it.—Come too, come amiable travellers!—I am rich, very rich indeed. We ſhall never leave one another; we ſhall live in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly union.—Ah! may my hoary age, comforted by you, forget the errors and misfortunes of my youth!</p>
               <p>Alexis, Sciocco and John made no anſwer. At laſt, the ſtranger, whoſe phyſiognomy was meek and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable, begged with ſuch energy and effect, that they could no longer withſtand his generous intentions.</p>

               <p>OUR four friends, after having ſworn the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable union, reſolved to ſet out for Paris the very next morning. John, whom the generoſity of the old man had again moved to tears, went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to take leave of his uncle Joachin. The ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger returned to his room, to pack up his portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaus, and Alexis being left alone with Sciocco, was much at a loſs what to think of him. Luckily, and through the old man's diſcretion, the affair of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

All appearances were certainly againſt the Italian; the timid and miſtruſting Alexis, knew not how to act in ſo delicate a juncture; and had it been the fate of Sciocco to be actually guilty, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards an humane and generous ſtranger, was, in all reſpects calculated to extricate him from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But it happened to turn out otherwiſe; Scioc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co was innocent; Alexis had been too haſty, too miſtruſting; of this he was ſenſible, He bluſhed, and dared hardly to lift his eyes towards the injured Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo—How little did he know him!

It wanted no leſs than this leſſon of a good heart, to make Alexis ſtill more ſenſible of his wrong. The more Sciocco attributed it to predeſtination, the more the other laid to his own charge all that had happened to him; the effect of the contradiction of human principles: one defect is always corrected by another of an oppoſite nature: miſtruſt and timidity vaniſh, if ſuperſeded by a noble confidence, the ſoul of all good undertakings.</p>
               <p>But let us loſe no time in reflections. Alexis has bluſhed—He has ſworn within himſelf to be more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and leſs inclined to ſuſpicion in future. Let us now beſtow our attention on the ſeries of his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

Alexis alighted with John for the purpoſe of walking in the evening air. A buſtle before the gate of the inn attracts their notice; they approach and look—It was the hoſtlers and ſervants of the inn, ordering away, with the greateſt inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a poor traveller, who requeſted permiſſion to reſt himſelf in the ſtables for that night.

Ah! dear Alexis, know your old friend; your faithful Dumont.—Dumont, you?—Yes, I am the ſame:—Good God, what a happy meeting! O heaven! thou haſt heard my vows.</p>
               <p>Dumont and Alexis are locked in each others arms: Alexis, who remembers the treachery of his tutor, ſees but a friend in this moment.</p>

The old man and Sciocco have left the poſt chaiſe; John ſhews them the affecting ſcene. Soon after they all five enter an apartment of the inn, order an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſupper, and enjoy the bliſs of the re-union.</p>
               <p>Dumont and his pupil, are ſtimulated with a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal eagerneſs to know each other's adventures, which they are equally deſirous to hear.</p>
               <p>The meal is ſerved, every one eats with the keeneſt appetite; and the deſert being brought in, Dumont, impatient of deſtroying the ſuſpicions which his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil might have entertained of his fidelity, haſtened, while all was attention, thus to commence his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, you too well remember, my dear Alexis, the cruel ſpectacle to which your father expoſed you at the inn at Valence. At his threats and his impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, you dropped down, and when you opened your eyes to the light, found yourſelf alone: well, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to me; you ſhall hear the moſt extraordinary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your imagination could ever judge. Hear me, Alexis, and condemn me not.</p>
               <p>While you laid ſenſeleſs on the floor, and I was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you all the aſſiſtance which friendſhip and human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity can afford, your father ſaid to me, in a ſavage tone of voice, You blame me, Mr. Dumont?—Come down for a moment, come down, and you ſhall find in my carriage, a perſon who will give you an account of the misfortunes this unhappy boy has brought upon me. But, ſir, can I leave him in ſuch a ſituation? He ſhall have every aſſiſtance: do come down ſtairs, I conjure you.</p>
               <p>Here he turned to the landlord: ſir, ſaid he, do not leave him. Come, then, Mr. Dumont! it is but a ſtep or two. I was heſitating whether I ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, or ſtay with you. At laſt, (who would have ſuſpected his cruelty?) I followed him down ſtairs, trembling, well perſuaded that I ſhould return with him, or alone: we advanced to a poſt chaiſe, which was waiting within a gunſhot from the inn. In it ſat a woman in years, and rather of a fineſter appearance. Step in, ſir, ſtep in, ſaid ſhe, it is only for a moment. I muſt tell you—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:030364_0201_0FE5D3A2256FE878"/>
She added many things: I would not hear her; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy about you, and about what they could want of me, I was ready to return to the inn; but time was not left to me; your father ſteps in, lays hold of my hand; three tall fellows in livery puſh me in the chaiſe, ſhut the door, and the poſt-boy raiſes clouds of duſt, ſo hard did he drive.</p>
               <p>I ſolemnly declare, that hurried away with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, I had no ſtrength to call for help; my firſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were horror and indignation. I looked at your father, and ſaid to him, with a bitter ſmile, Barbarous man! Is this the odious deſign you had upon me? You tear me from the unfortunate Alexis! Ah! he cannot ſurvive it!—Compoſe yourſelf, Mr. Dumont, Ah! did you know!—All your ferocity, unnatural father! I would, indeed, never have thought it!—Sir!—Oh! permit me to indulge my grief!—What do you want of me? What means that violence which you exerciſed upon me? have you any rights over me?—Ah, is it not enough to let looſe your rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſon?—His ſon! ſaid the lady, he is not his ſon. Oh, I am pretty ſure, madam, that you are not his mother, but his moſt cruel enemy!—I his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy! the enemy of that child! why, I don't know him. Had the gentleman followed my advice, he would have taken him along with us; I would have brought him up, I would.</p>
               <p>I glanced my eye with furious indignation upon the lady, and turning round to your father, conjuring him with tears in my eyes, to let me go back to you; I repreſented your ſituation, your grief, and ſucceeded in moving him a little. Mr. Dumont, ſaid he, what you aſk I cannot grant—You have been ſeen walking in the royal botanical gardens, you are known, ſearch is making after you both—Your life is in danger if you ſtay with him. I ſcorn it, ſir—His own life if he is alone, is not as much expoſed as it would be in your company—I cannot conceive it—That child is the torch of diſcord, which the gods have ſent in their wrath, to be the ſcourge of his unhappy parents!—Forget him, Mr. Dumont, and leave him as we do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> far from thoſe whoſe life he has embittered. It is yet
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030364_0202_0FE5D3BE21B72638"/>
a remnant of pity that makes me deſire you to leave Paris. You was undone, and ſo was he, had not I tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that precaution: He lives, let us conſign him to fate!—But, ſir, make me the confidence—Of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets?—Oh, no, Mr. Dumont! no, nobody ſhall know them—The grave will ſoon contain them and me!—What an aſtoniſhing myſtery—Impenetrable, my dear ſir!—Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

What, is he in danger, ſir?—Not ſo much; you have been diſcovered and would have been deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed!—I! good God, who are thoſe wretches!—Alas! I cannot divulge their names, and that makes me unhappy.</p>
               <p>Your father, my dear pupil, ſaid things which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed me ſtill more. The half confidence he made me, ſo captivated my eager curioſity, that I could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceive a poſt-chaiſe, flying with the rapidity of a dart, nor even the approach of night—We had juſt left a little village, when an unknown voice called out to the people behind the carriage: Hey, is it you, Champaign? Yes, anſwered the valet. It is they, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the voice to the cavaliers. This inſtant, they alight from their horſes, lay hold of the doors of the chaiſe, open them, and one of them ſaid very bluntly to your father, Hey, marquis, have you got that dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling child? you muſt either deliver him to us, or die inſtantly, you—Ah! my brother, cried the lady, ſtop! Is it you, my ſiſter?—Coward, replied your father, in a rage, ſtay, I'll alight; dare you take away my life? rather beware of thine.</p>
               <p>Your father, I, and his people, leave the carriage. We began with the ſtrangers, who were four or five in number, a bloody combat enſued, of which I could not ſee the iſſue, my ſkull being wounded with a ſword, in conſequence of which I fell down weltering in my blood.</p>
               <p>To all appearance, I laid for a long time ſenſeleſs on the ground; when I recovered my reaſon, it was
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030364_0203_0FE5D370654AFF40"/>
in the dead of night. I ſaw neither your father, nor the lady, nor any of the aſſaſſins near me, except ſeven or eight ſhabby fellows who carried me on a litter. They informed me on the road, that I was then half a league from Lyons; that the archbiſhop of that place, who paſſing by in his carriage, had heard my moans, one of his ſervants had been diſpatched, and informed him that thoſe groans were uttered by a wounded perſon, who could only be removed upon a litter. The arch biſhop had no ſooner reached Lyons, than he ſent people to bring me to the infirmary of the archbiſhoprick. I was actually carried there, and the archbiſhop came himſelf to know who had put me in ſuch a condition on the road. I thanked him for his humanity, and gave him ſome evaſive anſwers, to conceal the real cauſe of my wound.</p>
               <p>Is not the ſudden intruſion of theſe ſtrangers, and their combat with your father, a problem to you?—Well my dear Alexis, it was and ſtill is one to me. To all appearance they were your enemies; they were in purſuit of you, becauſe they thought to find you in the poſt-chaiſe, and one of them was the brother of the lady who accompanied us. But when I reflect upon your father's myſterious diſcourſe, and upon the ſnare laid for us in the inn at Valence, from which he delivered me, I could no help concluding them to be the very wretches whom alone we had reaſon to fear. Beſides, he that wounded me was no ſtranger to my perſon; for as much as I am able to recollect, he ſaid in giving me the blow, <hi>prithee where's thy pupil?</hi> I fell, and they left me, becauſe they thought I was dead. All that I can ſay is, that I can remember to have perceived among them the young man we met in the botanical garden, and who ſtared at us, ſaying to his father, <hi>It is, my father, here he is,</hi> &amp;c. Do you remember it, my Alexis?—Heavens!—Yes, ſurely, he was one of them.</p>
               <p>I was taken care of at the infirmary of Lyons; the metropolitan, from time to time came to viſit me, and to ſee me properly tended and treated.</p>
               <p>Having got well, I went out to take the air in the environs of Lyons, the ſituation of which is truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.

I diſcovered in one of my rural excurſions a little chappel; whoſe ancient and ruinous appearance ſtruck me much.—Being informed by a peaſant, of its having once been the retreat of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> hermit, I took it into my head to make it my reſidence.—I had loſt all hope of ever ſeeing you again, becauſe one of the people who waited on me, during my ailment, and a relation to the inn keeper at Valence, at whoſe houſe I had left you, having wrote to him with regard to you, and was anſwered, that ſame day that you had left the inn, and he did not know what was become of you.</p>
               <p>Having thus loſt every hope of ſeeing you again, and life being a burden to me, I communicated part of my misfortunes to the arch-biſhop, and intreated him, in the moſt earneſt manner to permit me to inhabit the hermitage I had ſeen. The prelate ſeemed at firſt to ſtate objections againſt my project; but ſeeing me ſo firmly reſolved, he not only granted my requeſt, but added a conſiderable donation, which was ſoon aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the charity, or curioſity of thoſe whom my edifying way brought to the hermitage. The maſter of the Dolphin inn was one; and John, who is here before us another. This worthy young man walked every day one league to bring me victuals; he often converſed with me; I truſted my ſorrow to his ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and he conſoled me as much as he was able—my good and ſenſible friend, be ſure heaven will reward thy kindneſs.</p>

As to Duverly, whom you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in your narrative—he is no more, that treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friend.—Are you ſure?—Yes, very ſure.—Alas! ſo Clara's father is dead!—Her mother has preceeded him, I have been told, long ago.

               <p>Theſe three friends ſwore to accompany Alexis whereſoever he ſhould go;—their departure for the cottage was of courſe fixed for the next morning.</p>
               <p>Alexis eaſily perceived in the old man an air of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint which aſtoniſhed him; but this he attributed to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In ſhort, our hero was happy: he had ſound again his faithful Dumont; he had found him as true to his attachment as he had been formerly. Moreover, the good natured Sciocco whom he loved, was alſo in his company, and two honeſt ſtrangers, one of whom had extricated him from a very critical ſituation, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the death of Duverly, and promiſing to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, himſelf, theſe tidings to Dorance—Thus, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the cottage, in hopes of ſeeing his dear Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, for he was ignorant of her departure.</p>

Love, its pleaſures and pangs, were diſcuſſed by Alexis and the old man; and the latter dwelt upon the ſubject with more ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſorrow than his young friend.

They were informed that the latter had returned to her husband, and were much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the man's good nature, who condeſcended with ſuch grace to receive his ſpouſe whenever ſhe thought it expedient or agreeable to favor him with her perſon.</p>
               <p>From Marcellin, (our ſtrangers having previouſly diſmiſſed the poſt-chaiſe,) preceeded gently on the road which leads to the foreſt of Chamboran. All five armed with piſtols, cutlaſſes, and ſtout cudgels, they feared no attack from the banditti who infeſted thoſe woody domains.</p>
               <p>Having thus walked to a diſtance of two leagues and upwards, upon paths well known to our Alexis, they deſcried a winding path, the draw-bridge, and the top of the cottage. They were exactly on the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                     </gap>i quoi;</hi> yet it was not quite diſpleaſing.</p>
               <p>M. de Preville's condition was far from being like that of Alexis; No ſooner did he perceive the cottage, and above all the great poplar that roſe its lofty top to the clouds, than he turned pale, and a cold ſweat quite chilled his frame—he dropped down ſenſeleſs on the moſſy ground.—Alexis endeavored to make him reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from his ſwoon; it was in vain, all his efforts joined to thoſe of his friends proved uſeleſs. Finally, they reſolved to carry him—to carry him—poor Alexis!—didſt thou but know what thou art doing.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that the confuſion and ſwoon of M. de Preville ſtruck his four friends with a moſt ſingular ſurprize. However deeply he might have been affected by Dorance, by Clara, even by the tragical exit of Adela, whom he owned to have known once, yet it ſeemed incredible that all this ſhould cauſe ſo violent a revolution in him—ſhould he have had a ſhare in the adventures of Dorance?—It was he!—Let us baniſh ſuperficial doubts, which we cannot clear up—let us enter the cottage, and not loſe ſight of our travellers. Thus they carried the unfortunate Preville to the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, which was drawn up. Nobody appeared, yet it was neceſſary for them to get admittance, which was certainly difficult, there being neither bell nor porter to ſavor their deſign. Long would they have waited, but for a circumſtance which turned out propiteous.</p>
               <p>Candor, ſince the flight of his dear Clara, which had affected him to an extreme, ſuffered not a ſingle day to elapſe, without mounting the wall of the foſſe, to ſee whether he could deſcry her coming from afar. Always in hopes of ſeeing again the lovely child, whom he cheriſhed as his own, he ſpent whole days upon a kind of terrace, ſhedding tears, and imploring provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to reſtore his dear Clara.</p>
               <p>"Great God!" ſaid he, inceſſantly, "thou who knoweſt my heart, thou who knoweſt how dear I held that offspring of crime, thee I call to witneſs the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my feelings!—I had, indeed, no other intention
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:030364_0210_0FE5D3C052EFFA08"/>
when I firſt brought her up, than to devote her a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to my vengeance; but how much have I abhorred that attrocious deſign!—the ſenſible, gentle, engaging Clara was my daughter; I had adopted her for ſuch; I forgot her father's treachery, my ſpouſe's perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I forgot all!—She is fled, ſhe is left a generous benefactor to follow her lover!—her lover whom I have inhumanly exiled!—with what deſign? to ſend him in purſuit of a man, whom it is impoſſible for him to meet with. Left alone to himſelf in this wide world, could Alexis diſcover the retreat of my enemy, the infamous Duverly?—Thus a vain deſire of revenge has robbed me of my friend, of Clara, of all that was dear to me! O my God, thou doſt puniſh me!—well have I deſerved the frowns of thy juſtice."</p>
               <p>Theſe were the affecting ejaculations which Candor ſent to heaven, when a noiſe at his feet juſt facing the draw-bridge, made him caſt his eyes downwards—What does he perceive?—Alexis!—Alexis!—can it be he?—Yes, it is the good natured Alexis, it is he—attended by four ſtrangers. Candor examines eagerly each face; he ſeeks his daughter—ſhe is not among them!—O grief!</p>
               <p>But who is that ſtranger, pale, feeble, ſupported by his young friend? Candor believes he knows his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! he tries to recollect—ſhould it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e Duverly?—Duverly! ſhould there be ſome colluſion between Alexis and him! do they both come to inſult him!—three ſtrangers follow them! What means this cabal.</p>
               <p>Candor heſitates for a moment whether or not he ought to open the cottage to this band—he is alone with an old ſervant as weak as he. But why ſhould he remain in ſuſpence? If he muſt periſh, his life ſhall be ſold dear to his aſſaſſins! It is Duverly! yes Candor knows him! What a fury blazes in his heart!</p>
               <p>While he was thus engaged in thought, Alexis, who perceived him, cried in a tone of ſweetneſs and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy: <hi>Father, let down the drawbridge—We are all your friends!</hi>—You all my friends?</p>
               <p>Candor calls Germain; they both let down the draw-bridge.—Alexis, Sciocco, Dumont, John Picot, and M. de Preville enter. M. de Preville, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered

               <p>Alexis looks around for his Clara; he does not ſee her, he turns pale, he is going to enquire for her of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but the latter ſaves him that trouble. What do you ſeek here, young man!—Have you avenged me?—Where is my enemy's head!—Upbraid me not, I pray, my father, this reſpectable old gentleman, who condeſcended to accompany me, will ſatisfy your curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity.</p>
               <p>Dorance, who ſees his doubts realized, ſtares boldly at M. de Preville, whoſe tongue denies its office; Alexis occupied in looking for his Clara, goes all round the place. Dumont, Sciocco, and John wait with terror the iſſue of an event which they begin to comprehend better: all four actors impelled by different ſentiments, repreſent a ſtrong characteriſtic picture, and for ſome minutes, the profoundeſt ſilence reigns among them.</p>
               <p>De Preville breaks it firſt. Well, Dorance, what do you fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Your duty, anſwered the unmaſked old man, doubtleſs, you have done your duty and fulfilled your promiſe: Dorance, ſaid he, to Candor, I come to ſurrender myſelf to thy juſt vengeance. My fate is in thy hands, take away my life and I will not murmur. I have deceived, abuſed, and baſely betrayed thee—under the maſk of friendſhip, I have given thee moſt cruel blows to thy generous and confiding heart—I have cauſed the death of a woman equally dear to us both—I ſtill offend thee, I ſee, by my diſcourſe; why doſt thou tarry? here is my breaſt, pierce it, it waits the mortal blow from thy hand; it waits—without a moan.</p>
               <p>Alexis throws himſelf down before Duverly, whom Dorance ſurveyed with the higheſt indignation.—Cowardly foe, ſaid he to Preville; how dareſt thou to brave and inſult me?—To inſult thee, what I?—O

Dorance! I wiſh thou couldſt pry into the innermoſt receſſes of my heart? I wiſh thou couldſt ſee it divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, lacerated, and bleeding with repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe!—Alas, aſk that guilty heart! It will tell thee, that even when it betrayed thee, it felt love, pity, and ſelf-deteſtation! Yes, Dorance, thee I have betrayed, but how muſt I ſmart for it!—Yet, think not I ſeek to avert the avenging dagger of thy auguſt fury; ſtab this heart, and I ſhall not utter a groan. Thou ſhalt not hear me ſay that youth and the violence of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable paſſion, have hurled me into the abyſs in which we both are fallen. I ſhall not remind you of our converſation at Grenoble, when you owned, you loved Miſs Myrſange, and that it was the deſire of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to unite you with her. Long before had I adored her; long before had Adela vowed to crown my love with mutual affection. What have not I done to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you from a marriage which I foreſaw to be preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the greateſt miſery for two friends—Adela ſwore ſhe never could be happy but with me—Her mother forced her to give thee her hand—Thou loved her with all the phrenzy of enthuſiaſtic love, and I too!</p>
               <p>We went to Paris; I uſed every effort to ſurmount a fatal paſſion, whoſe exceſs made me ſhrink with horror. I will hide the fatal ſecret in my boſom, remember—thou comeſt—thou teareſt from me—I am upon the point of confeſſing all—the name alone baffles my utterance—thou giveſt me encouragement, makeſt me hope, I liſten to thee—thou anſwereſt for me Adela's letter!—Ah! this was the firſt fault which led me to many others!—The ſtep was made; confidence was then unſeaſonable and would have proved deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to my own ſelf: love, efferveſcence, and ill placed ſhame, all, all forced me to the crime!</p>
               <p>You ſee, dear enemy, that I pretend not to juſtify my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; I am guilty—Thy miſery and that of thy family has been cauſed by me: I condemn myſelf; I have met with this youth, he related to me his adventures, thy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes and thy wiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am prepared to accompliſh them. I come to acquit thy vow, ſtrike, I tell thee once more, ſtrike; I would ſcorn pity!—Pity! wilt thou, villain ſpeak of pity? ah, I pitied my ſpouſe, the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

of women, after I had barbarouſly thruſt a dagger in her boſom! It was however the effect of the black ſuſpicion which thou haſt exiled in my heart?—Des Roches is the ſole author, that deteſtable termagant foſtered my paſſion for Adela, it is ſhe who furniſhed us with means of obtaining mutual interviews, it is ſhe who excited me to betray thee—ſhe no ſooner ſaw Adela's repentance and our ſeparation than ſhe forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to glut a paſſion, which ſhe ſaid, glowed in her breaſt for me. The tokens of indignation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which manifeſted at this overture, kindled her rage, ſhe was bent on my ruin, and would involve you and your ſpouſe into the gulf opened by her infernal vengeance. Having robbed me of letters—fatal let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which I ſhould have a thouſand times deſtroyed; ſhe ſent them to you, while I was in North Carolina, with the moſt calumnious imputations.—Poor Adela, terrified at a ſecret information ſhe received of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, imprudently ſeeks ſafety in flight, you purſue her.—You ſhudder! Oh, It is for me to ſhudder! It was my fatal paſſion which guided your hand—Oh, let me ſee that bloody tree where ſhe received the deadly wound! let me ſee if—This is not the only monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, barbarous man, which puts me in mind of thy perfidiouſneſs: come, deſcend with me into the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſubterranean, where I preſerve the precious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of my victims; come, but alone with me?—There I'll offer thee a ſacrifice to the manes of my ſpouſe and ſon! Let us go, I am prepared.</p>
               <p>Candor and Duverly laid hold of one another's hands, and forgetting to pull up the drawbridge, they advance towards the door of the ſubterranean tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Alexis and his friends attempt to ſtop them.—Let us alone, cried they!—Divine juſtice muſt be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Alexis, Dumont, John, even Germain himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their paſſage; but ſuddenly Sciocco calls them aſide; they expect to get ſome important advice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, <hi>Cuoni Cavalieri,</hi> ſaid Carlo, let them go down alone into the cave;—If they are not to periſh, they will not; but if it is decreed for either—</p>
               <p>Alexis, impatient of being thus detained, puſhes him back, and joins the two furious old men; Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,

               <p>I ſhall not repeat what farther converſation paſſed between the two enemies; their mutual reproaches and menaces are obvious to imagination.

                  <p>THE POINT OF RE-UNION IN THE COTTAGE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEVERAL days had elapſed ſince the departure of M. Du Monay, the receiver. The marquis and marchioneſs had every regard for Clara, whom they ſtill believed to be the receiver's niece, and cheriſhed her from this conſideration.</p>
               <p>The marquis, marchioneſs and Clara, took one day an airing in the delightful gardens of Luxembourgh, a place of faſhionable reſort. Having made ſeveral turns, they, in imitation of other ſtrangers, ſat down upon a chair, to reſt themſelves from the fatigues of their walk.</p>
               <p>A perſon, who appeared to be an abbe, was ſitting by Clara, and had gazed at her for a long time, ſo as to put her to the bluſh, and could not help expreſſing his curioſity in theſe words: Miſs, I beg you a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pardons for my indiſcretion; pray, had not I the honor of ſeeing you ſomewhere? Clara looks in his face, and ſeems to know him—ſhe bluſhes. The abbe perceived it. I ſee you recollect me, ſaid he.—Pray was it not at Lyons? no,—you are however much like a certain Alexis—Alexis! cried the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis and marchioneſs both at once.—Alexis! cried a
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:030364_0215_0FE5D3A9903834D8"/>
woman in her turn, who was ſitting a little farther!—Yes, replied the abbe, you are that Alexis whom I ſaw at the baroneſs d'Yrace! Father Stephen, whiſpered the trembling Clara, pray have done. What do you wiſh to ſay of Alexis? aſked the woman.—I have ſeen a young man of that name at Marſeilles.—At Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles, madam? ſaid the intimidated Clara. Have you known Alexis at Marſeilles? Alas, miſs, don't revive that deareſt remembrance. Deareſt, you ſay, madam? Should you be the young lady from M. Du Monay's? Who told you my tyrant's name? Yes, I am the unfortunate Sophia, who loved ſo much the young Alexis! Let us not be under a miſtake, ladies, ſaid the ex-capuchin. I ſpeak of the lovely Clara here before us; and you, madam, of that Alexis, who runs all over the world to ſeek a father whom he has never known? A father he has never known! replied the marquis with great emotion. Ah! what do you tell me? what name have you uttered?—Softly my dear, ſaid the marchioneſs, methinks our Clara has more knowledge of the whole affair: we ſhall beg of her for information:—Knowledge of Alexis, madam, I have indeed!—Good God! my huſband and I are much concerned for him; pray explain yourſelf.—Madam, neither the time nor place are ſuitable. I beg it as a favor, let us return to the hotel, and there I will give you a moſt faithful account of what you may wiſh to know, though I have the ſtricteſt injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the contrary from my uncle: forgive that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; I mean to ſay from my worthy benefactor.</p>
               <p>Clara and the noble pair riſe from their ſeats: Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra diſcovering her rival in Sophia, caſts a glance of indignation upon her, which the latter endeavors to interpret. By this time, father Stephen ſeeing he muſt looſe his prey, attempts to whiſper to Clara, and ſhe will not hear him; the ex capuchin, awed by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the marquis and his ſpouſe, proceeds no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he retires quite deſperately, and our three friends return to the hotel, where the marchioneſs, who had violently reſtrained her feelings, let fall a torrent of tears. You will not be ſurpriſed, my lovely Clara, ſaid ſhe ſobbing, at the impreſſion which the adventure
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:030364_0216_0FE5D3C5D3E67B80"/>
of the gardens make upon me, when you ſhall come to know. From the deſcription given of his perſon, it can be no other than your ſon, my dear lord! Your ſon! cried Clara with an exaltation of voice, your ſon! What, my lord, ſhould Alexis be your ſon? Yes, anſwered the marquis, fetching a deep ſigh, and here is his mother! Oh Alexis, Alexis! where art thou?—Come fly to their arms! Clara you augment our anguiſh; ſpeak, ſpeak, have pity on a father's pain.</p>
               <p>Clara, in a tranſport of joy, is unable to collect her ideas; ſhe lifts her eyes up to heaven, and utters vague exclamations; ſoon after, ſhe makes an apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for having, on account of Du Monay's inſtruction, concealed her hiſtory from her benefactors. They all ſit down, and Clara relates her own hiſtory, and that of Alexis, his reſidence and flight from the cottage; and concludes with owning that ſhe knew not what had become of her lover. He was at Marſeilles, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe; there he turned faithleſs! there he got ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that Sophia whom we have juſt left; but as he has not accompanied her, I know not where he can be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh my God! why does thy power not read him to this houſe?—Alas! how happy would he be!—and we how happy.</p>
               <p>Arzelia and her lord could hardly reſpire during the long narrative of Clara; the marquis eſpecially, who remembered his cruelties, his wrongs to ſo amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a ſon, and the vexations he had cauſed him through the malice of his enemies, could not forgive himſelf. It is I, exclaimed he; I am that unnatural father, who involved him into the abyſs of wretchedneſs!—Where is he? innocent youth: What is his fate?—O God, thou art witneſs to the ſearches and purſuits I have made ſince the bleſſed inſtant which re-united me with my ſpouſe!—I ſent emiſſaries, and went myſelf to a thouſand places, to ſeek a ſon who coſts me ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears! O Clara! if ever we find him, he ſhall be thy conſort!—Be both our children.—Ah! how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy art thou of his heart and affections.</p>
               <p>During theſe ſentimental emanations, the marchion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs became very penſive. All on a ſudden ſhe breaks in on her huſband's diſcourſe. My friend—my dear
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030364_0217_0FE5D3ABC2AC0948"/>
friend—an idea takes my fancy!—yes, hope influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces my mind, and fills my ſoul with conſolation! per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he has returned to the cottage; we may find him there! Madam, he certainly knows not that I have left it; he might, but no, he has forgot me; there was no place I paſſed through in my journey, but gave me the ſad news of his broken faith. At St. Marcellin, ah! the perfidious Alexis; perhaps he conſoles himſelf in ſome other quarter of the world with ſome new conqueſt. My daughter, believe a mother's heart! Your own was too intimately connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his! you were born for one another; he will return to the cottage, he will ſurely return: Oh! ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with my father's blood! What a baneful ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion! can a youth of ſo ſweet and timid a temper, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly himſelf with that attrocious murder? he is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing it, to be bleſt with his father's feelings. So he is graced with your virtues, my deareſt Arze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, he muſt ſhrink at the very name of crime.</p>
               <p>The marquis and marchioneſs, after having teſtified a thouſand tender concerns for the fate of their ſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſet out inſtantly for the cottage. If he is not there, ſaid they, we will wait for him. To live in a place which our ſon has inhabited will at leaſt be ſome conſolation for us. Clara knew not whether to accept or decline the journey—piqued at her lover's infidelity; eager to ſee again the hermitage, her Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and the beneficent Candor, of whom ſhe had no occaſion to be afraid, while under the auſpices of the parents of Alexis; her mind was divided between a thouſand different thoughts; yet the ſweet deſire of again ſeeing the cottage, and perhaps her lover too, overcame all her ſcruples.</p>
               <p>In leſs than a day every thing was prepared for the intended journey. They ſet off, arrive at St. Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, alight from their carriage, commit it to the care of a valet, and take the pleaſant road of the foreſt of de Chamboran, under an eſcort of four vigorous domeſtics armed with piſtols and cutlaſſes.</p>
               <p>After a long walk of two hours and upwards, they deſcry before them the walls of the cottage; the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge being ſtill let down and the door open, cauſed
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:030364_0218_0FE5D3951BD9A380"/>
Clara to be much ſurpriſed. Good God, cried ſhe, ſhould Candor, be dead, or has the place been taken by aſſault, and plundered? Already her mind was agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a thouſand ſuſpicions, when ſhe perceived ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tracts of the footſteps of a man, which were directed towards the cottage. This revived Clara's hopes.—Alas! ſaid ſhe, could we find him! oh! Alexis! ſhould theſe be the traces of thy feet.</p>
               <p>Clara looks around, ſhe examines all theſe marks—ſhe even believes to diſtinguiſh them for being thoſe of her lover's foot: childiſh reflections, a ridiculous illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, begot by a fancy wholly taken up with its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject!—Without doubt, this reflection muſt appear ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trifling to the readers; yet Clara could not be miſtaken:—let us then follow her.</p>
               <p>The drawbridge, which was let down, favored the acceſs of our little troop to the cottage. They enter the premiſes—look around on all ſides, and perceive nobody. Clara takes the van:—how her poor heart beats—ſhe enters the apartments—not a ſoul!—ſhe looks in the garden not a ſoul!—Where is then Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and Candor?—Ah! I hear them ſpeak, and very loud too—Heaven! the voice of Alexis! yes, it is his voice;—<hi>Clara is more your daughter than Duver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's! Have compaſſion, my father!</hi> Did Alexis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe words? Oh! I'm certain it is his voice, cried Clara, quite moved! His voice! replied the marquis and his ſpouſe; what, our ſon's voice?</p>
               <p>Now all three unable to gueſs whence the ſounds proceeded, liſten, without moving, and in the attitude of three ſtatues.</p>
               <p>At laſt, Clara cries, it is from the temple! Oh, come, come!—we ſhall find them there.</p>
               <p>The door was actually open. Clara, the marquis, and Arzelia, deſcended with precipation down the little ſtairs—ſuddenly the faint glimmer of the lamp replaces day-light; and leave them only a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect view of objects;—Alexis turns his head: Clara, cries he!—Alexis! there is your father!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here,</hi> I feel my inability of deſcribing with proper energy, the ſudden ſenſations of each of our reſpective heroes. My pen is not ſufficient to expreſs their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe

and tranſports. Can what happens in an inſtant, admit of a long and tedious narration? My readers will form, themſelves, an idea of this picture, if they pleaſe to remember, that Candor finds again his dear Clara; Duverly, his daughter; the latter, her father, her benefactor, and her lover; Alexis, a father, whom he had ſo long panted for; the noble couple, a ſon who had coſt them ſo many tears; in ſhort, Germain, Dumont, &amp;c. met again with dear friends of whom they had been ſo long deprived.</p>
               <p>What effuſions of heart!—what queſtions!—Are you here?—Is it you?—You, my father!—My dear ſon, &amp;c. They were all ſpeaking, and none did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.—All their faculties were ſuſpended; their ſouls felt too much for expreſſion; they were claſped in each others arms, in the ſweeteſt rapture.</p>
               <p>At laſt, Alexis, who was afraid leſt Dorance and Duverly ſhould reſume their former converſation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged every body to leave that diſmal place. They all gather and join in a body: Clara between the two enemies, Alexis between the marquis and marchion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs; Sciocco, loſt in admiration; Dumont and John both moved to the ſoul, cloſe the rear, and our heroes enter the garden, where they aſk each other for an account of their adventures. How happy am I, ſaid Clara to Alexis, to have brought back your father!—And how unhappy am I to have reſtored you to your own! Doſt thou deſerve ſtill, faithleſs man, that I ſhould ſhow the leaſt concern for thee!—Ah! do not rebuke me, Clara!—It was againſt my own wiſh I ſerved the cruel Dorance!—Pray, what is become of the goaler's wife, and that Sophia of Marſeilles? I do not comprehend you! I know all, ungrateful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexis, I know all—and am ſorry to have ever loved you.</p>
               <p>Alexis endeavors to unravel the meaning of this diſcourſe; but his father interrupts him: So I have found you my dear ſon!—Can you ſtill love a father who has ſo cruelly forſaken you in the inn at Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

you then found my ſon?—how, how, all theſe meetings are like ſo many miracles!—Oh! replies Sciocco, what an irrefragable proof of the law of events!—Why, ſays Dumont, there is nothing aſtoniſhing in theſe meetings: What is ſurpriſing, is when ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals find each other in a corner of the globe, where none of them had any buſineſs, where none of them was called; but when we have a point of re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?—Did we not all look for each other? Did we not all repair to this place becauſe we preſumed it fitteſt for us to meet than any other. Yes, replied Sciocco, <hi>è vero;</hi> but what makes it appear to me ſo very ſtrange, is, that we all arrived in one day. It is rather ſtrange, if chance had brought it about.—Otherwiſe you mean, that would have broke the great order which would be morally impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Dorance glanced on Duverly with looks expreſſive of fury and rage. This event which had ſuſpended Candor's reſentment, had not extinguiſhed it.—His ſoul indeed foſtered no more bloody and cruel projects, but he cannot bear the fight of his enemy.—Duverly, actuated by fear and ſelf diffidence da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Soon the whole troop reaches the grove, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends itſelf along the rivulet. There, every one ſets down, and every one is requeſted to give an account of his adventures: doubtleſs, thoſe of the father of Alexis were of the moſt intereſting nature. Neither would the marquis ſuffer any long intreaties. He places his ſon between him and his ſpouſe; they form a circle all around, and the marquis begins a narration, which the reader muſt have long ago de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>THE THUILLERIES AND PONT-TOURNANT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LOVE, intereſt and ambition are the three ſcourges which deſolated my life;—Love was my own crime; intereſt ſwayed my barbarous brother; and ambition became the motive of all the vexations which a father heaped upon me:—why do I ſay a father!—he was not my father, and had no claim to that title!—Nevertheleſs, I loved him, I reſpected him, and that timid reſpect has always hindered me from ſhaking off the heavy yoke, beneath which he would cruſh me. Alas! without his ſon, without the cruel chevalier d'Anfort!—But I ſee theſe exclamations are a mere enigma to you my friends; I ought to explain it and relate the hiſtory of my family; thence I will make a digreſſion upon my misfortunes—therefore attend to me.</p>
               <p>Aurora Bleville, my mother, was the daughter of the celebrated count Bleville<note n="*" place="bottom">The fictitious names of Bleville, Corſange, &amp;c. have been ſubſtituted out of reſpect for the families of my heroes, of which ſeveral diſtinguiſhed families are now in being.</note> ambaſſador at the court of Madrid in the preceding reign; ſhe could aſpire to the hand of the moſt diſtinguiſhed young noblemen who then graced the gay circles of the court, as much by her beauty and virtues, as by the powerful credit which her father enjoyed: but young ſtill, ſhe ſaw the count, and was no longer free to make a choice of her own. The count, on his ſide, fell deſperately in love with Aurora, and even carried his imprudence ſo far as to demand her in marriage. The ambaſſador, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at this proceeding, diſcarded the young noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, put his daughter in a convent, and compelled her a few months after, to tie the marriage knot with the marquis de Corſange, the king's favorite, of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable diſpoſition, and endowed with a thouſand bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant qualities; but for him Aurora felt an invincible repugnance; ſhe complied, however with a father's command, and gave proofs to her huſband, if not of
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030364_0222_0FE5D3967A49E000"/>
love, at leaſt of eſteem and friendſhip. I was the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of this marriage, and my mother feeling for me all the attachment of maternal fondneſs, began to be accuſtomed to her preſent ſtate of conjugal union, when ſuddenly a cruel incident revived in her the ſparks of her former paſſion, and its hopes. The king was at that time engaged in a war with Germany. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador and his ſon in law, who ſought by one another's ſide, were both, and at the ſame inſtant, laid dead on the field by a cannon ball. My mother, who ſaw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus ſuddenly rid of her father's and huſband's yoke, thought only of contracting a ſecond marriage: ſhe was then twenty-ſix, and count d'Anfort was thirty: both free, both equally in love, they ſaw one another again, and joined in wedlock: but the imprudent Aurora, by this match, alienated from her the friendſhip of my father's whole family. Nobody would ſee or aſſiſt me, when afterwards I was compelled by misfortune to have recourſe to them.</p>
               <p>Lady d'Anfort began to exact of her new huſband that I ſhould be brought up in his own eyes, and he neglected nothing to make me happy, and to render my education brilliant. The count promiſed all, and faithfully kept his word for two years: I mean, till his ſpouſe preſented him with a ſon of his own. It is he, my friends, who is the cauſe of all my misfortunes.</p>
               <p>The tenderneſs which the count and my mother felt for this ſon, the fruits of love, rather than that of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, ſingularly cooled them in their affections for me. A child as I was, I perceived and complained of it to my mother, who anſwered with ſullen ſteadineſs: "Well, ſir, you ſhall no longer be the object of that neglect; for to-morrow you are to be ſent to college, where you will ſtay till you have completed your ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies." I was thunderſtruck at theſe words, and ſpent the whole day in ſhedding tears, and on the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet out, attended by one ſervant. When I went to embrace my mother, I remarked that ſhe turned her back upon me—My heart was depreſſed, and I was upon the point of leaving the apartment, when my father-in-law, who ſaw my anguiſh, claſped me in his arms, and gently preſſed a little preſent in my hand,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:030364_0223_0FE5D37FB7F541A0"/>
telling me with an air of affection, that if I was ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and would behave well, he would give me liberty to come to his hotel once a month. Theſe words made me a little calmer: I ſlept into the carriage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired with my valet to the college of Navarre—the ſame college where I ſince put my Alexis!</p>
               <p>There I found a tutor waiting for me; a true pedant, quite made up of Latin and Greek, and who only added to my melancholy during all the time I had to ſpend in that priſon.</p>
               <p>I was then twelve years of age, and I began to think my mother's coolneſs was a real torment to me. Whence could it proceed?—had I behaved ill to her? and ſuppoſe this had been the caſe, ſhould ſhe not have made ſome allowance to a boy only twelve years old? Yet the count's careſſes had replaced her more than ever in my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lial fondneſs. From that moment I loved her as much as ſhe had diſpleaſed me before. Senſible hearts have no ſteadineſs in their opinions. A harſh expreſſion will grieve and diſcard them—the leaſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs makes their affections return even farther than it has been before; it is as eaſy to make them happy, as to afflict them.</p>
               <p>During the firſt year of my being at college, I had the ſatisfaction to go from time to time to the hotel d'Anfort;—the ſecond year, I was ſent for leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; the third leſs ſtill, and ſoon I became quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t of queſtion. I lived in the college, forgot, as it were, by all nature, left to the care of mercenary peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with no other compenſation than the company of a friend of the ſame age as myſelf, whom I had the good fortune to find there.</p>
               <p>This friend! forgive me my giving a tear to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Dulys was his name; he profeſſed the moſt ſteady at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to me: the ſame temper, the ſame affection, in a word, every thing united us; we were always together. On thoſe days which were fixed for the ſtudents to walk out, we leſt the crowd to our fellow-ſtudents to give
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:030364_0224_0FE5D35E130848B0"/>
ſcope to our reflections. In ſhort, the moſt tender friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip operated equally on our hearts. How he pitied my condition; how he could alleviate my ſorrows! But as I ſee my dear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>ver this circumſtance of my hiſtory, which will ſoon, in your eyes, overwhelm me with confuſion and guilt.</p>
               <p>Dulys was then fatherleſs; his mother, who loved him tenderly, lived at Dreux, and never came to Paris, but her ſon regularly ſpent the holidays with her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mrs. Dulys waited for that period with as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience as I felt ſorrow at its approach.—Alone in the college, bereft of my friends and parents, during two months of the year, I had no other medium than to ſtudy or to ſhed tears:—Youthful ſtage of life, with what bitterneſs haſt thou been annoyed!</p>
               <p>I had now been ſix years at college, when I was one day informed that a ſervant deſired to ſpeak to me. I go down, my heart palpitates for joy at the ſight of my ſtep-father's livery. Sir, ſaid the man, come quick with me! your mother is breathing her laſt. A thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt could not have ſtruck me as much as this news<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Heaven, what accident has happened?—What ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident?

               </p>
               <p>I felt ſo many ſenſations of grief cauſed by ſudden ſtarts of thought, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the marquis de Corſange.—I give him full authority over you; obey him as you would me, and remember that you would do me an outrage in the tomb, which is ready to ſwallow me, ſhould you be wanting in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards him!</p>
               <p>I preſſed my mother's hand, and bathed it in my tears; the count ſtood weeping at the bed ſide, and his ſon next him.—This is your brother, added my mother, pointing to the chevalier d'Anfort; I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you both to live in cloſe intimacy, and to love one another till death ſhall part you—do you promiſe me that?</p>
               <p>I ſtammered a few monoſyllables. Young d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort anſwers, Yes; his voice being intercepted by ſobs. His mother takes him in her arms attempts to embrace him, falls back on the pillow, and inſtantly expires! Notwithſtanding the awfulneſs and horror of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it grieved me to the heart that the laſt glance of my mother had been thrown on young d'Anfort. I envied him for it, and ſhowed him a hatred, which I could not ſuppreſs afterwards: this without doubt was my only offence; I charge myſelf with it, but I could not conquer it.</p>
               <p>Two days after my mother's death, the count, who ſhowed me many marks of friendſhip, embraced and promiſed me an eternal attachment; begging me at the ſame time to return to the college; whither I went accordingly with a heart bleeding with ſorrow. Dulys no ſooner ſaw me than he flew to my arms. I related to him all that had happened, and we agreed unanimouſly that it would be neceſſary for me to be upon my guard againſt the fate which awaited me, as my only dependence was now on a man whom I was a ſtranger to. Yet I felt ſome concern for that man; I reſpected him; I even went farther, I loved him, he had gained ſuch an aſcendency over me, that I fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dared not to ſpeak before him. What follows will ſhow you how fatal that timidity has proved to me.</p>
               <p>I remained two years longer at college; yet the count uſed to ſend for me once every fortnight.—Thus I ſaw him, and the more his kindneſs attached
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:030364_0226_0FE5D3415EA4BA00"/>
me to him, the more I deteſted the odious character of my brother. He was ſcarce fourteen, but his haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and impudence controuled all his actions. He ſcarcely deigned to look at me, called me always <hi>Sir,</hi> and rendered himſelf to be equally deteſtable to all thoſe who came near him. All his faults had a cauſe; my mother, who made him her idol, indulged him in all his whims from his earlieſt infancy; he reigned with deſpotic ſway over all the domeſtics, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prices of a child were to be a ſacred law to thoſe who were appointed to wait upon him. If chance ever made her mention my name to him, it was always to tell him, "My little d'Anfort, my darling child, I love thee more, yes, I cheriſh thee more than him, &amp;c." a hundred ſimilar expreſſions, of which I was informed, tended to foſter the boy's vanity, and to inſpire him with a ſovereign contempt for me.—His father, on the other hand, in ſpite of all the friendſhip he bore to me, made him the ſole object of his tenderneſs.—That good father even carried his love to weakneſs, nay ſo far, that the little maſter often behaved to him with diſreſpect. At laſt the father's indulgence became as exceſſive as the ſon's arrogance. We often quarrelled: but I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided differences with the moſt ſcrupulous care, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſaw they became very vexatious to my dear preceptor! the more ſo, as he always intereſted his conſcience in the boy's favor. At laſt the chevalier's inſult appeared to me rather contemptible than wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of my notice. I did not foreſee that my complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance in yielding would coſt me ſo much one day, and that my brother would ſoon aſſume ſuch rights over me, as have rendered my life truly miſerable.</p>
               <p>The count, ſince my mother's deceaſe, took to his houſe a very rich old maiden ſiſter, who treaſured up her conſiderable finances for his ſon. This woman doated ſo much on her nephew as to call him her jewel, her happineſs; ſhe could never find terms ſtrong enough to expreſs her fondneſs and affection. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſhe eſteemed me, and had much more regard for me, than ſhe ſaw the young gentleman would condeſcend to honor me with. In conſequence, I put up with all their oddities, and hoped that all this
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030364_0227_0FE5D386330A1DC8"/>
complaiſance to the jewel of the houſe would make it poſſible for me to live in ſome comfort.</p>
               <p>I was twenty, and had three times repeated my courſe of ſtudy, when the count would have his hotel to be my conſtant reſidence. I joyfully accepted his offer; and of all the profeſſions which he left to my choice, I gave the preference to a military life, though he ſeemed to adviſe me to take holy orders, foreſeeing that I could not then fail to leave, one day, my whole eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to his ſon, or the heirs of his body. Nevertheleſs, he would not force my inclinations, and purchaſed me a lieutenancy in the regiment of Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I was very well at my guardian's, where I had no other vexation than the tricks and malicious proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my brother; but for theſe I conſoled myſelf with my friend Dulys: he, like me, had finiſhed the courſe of his claſſical ſtudies, and was now ſtudying law to qualify himſelf for the bar. His mother had put him to board with a gentleman in the neighborhood, where we could ſee one another at all hours. The marquis and all the family were fond of him, and he was indeed the common friend of us all, except my brother, who could not bear him: but little did Dulys trouble himſelf about him, and we were all well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>My diſpoſition was ſedentary, gloomy, and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical.—I had no ruling paſſion nor taſtes: ſtudy and reading were my ſole delight. Dulys was of the ſame caſt; we would often ſpend whole days in reading and making reflections.—Women were one day the topic of oar converſation; Dulys particulariſed all the dangers to which marriage e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Doubtleſs, he argued like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced young man; but I liſtened to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the reſult of which was a mutual oath never to marry.—A fooliſh, ſenſeleſs promiſe, never made, but when the paſſions lay dormant in our breaſt!—Frail ſtructure, which the leaſt wind can overthrow!—To my ſorrow I felt it but too much afterwards.</p>

                  </gap>dmother, an old lady uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly rich, who was very fond of me, and had prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed many times to conſtitute me her ſole and univerſal heir. This counteſs, who was equally blind with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the chevalier d'Anfort, was glad to ſee that her intentions ſhould become uſeful one day, to that dear family. Being therefore ſick of a dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, ſome time after, ſhe ordered us all to her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and dictated, in our preſence the different articles of her will. Corſange, ſaid ſhe to me, the moſt tender friendſhip united me with your father; I have made you my ſucceſſor, I am rich, and owe my fortune to no one: to you I bequeath the whole bulk of my eſtate, but on condition of your ſigning a deed before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, by which you are to promiſe me never to marry, and leave your eſtate after your death, in reverſion to your brother, or his next heir, by due courſe of law.</p>
               <p>Bewildered as I was by my philoſophy, I conſented to all, and ſigned all. The counteſs expires; count d'Anfort demands a copy of my renunciation, and takes upon him the adminiſtration of this new eſtate, till I ſhould be of age. By it, I acquired an annual income of three hundred thouſand livres, and upwards.</p>
               <p>I leave you now to think, if, after this, my friendſhip was courted by the family of the count d'Anfort. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery body careſſed me, even the chevalier received or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from his father to treat me with more gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and politeneſs; in ſhort, as a perſon of high value.</p>
               <p>I had unknowingly ſigned my ruin, and repented not; Dulys too, who was as mad as myſelf, endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored to confirm me in my principles, and I was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py!

part of my adventures. Prepare yourſelves to hear a ſeries of horrors and unjuſt actions, brooded by the blackeſt and moſt baleful malignity.</p>
               <p>Miſs D'Anfort, my ſtep father's ſiſter, had a friend, who was baron d'Arceville. That friend, who had been a widower long ſince, lived with his only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at one of his manors. He frequently wrote to miſs d'Anfort, who had been very intimate with his late ſpouſe. One day ſhe received a letter from the baron, in which he mentioned among other things: "That as ſome urging affairs called him to the Weſt-Indies, he was obliged to ſit out within a month. As I dare not, added he, expoſe my daughter to the hazards of ſo long a voyage, and firmly rely upon our ancient friendſhip, I ſhall make bold to put her under your care, for the time I ſhall be abſent. I hope you will not refuſe me that ſervice:—We ſhall be in Paris by the end of this week at fartheſt.</p>
               <p>Miſs d'Anfort, enraptured with her friend's confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in her, ordered an apartment to be fitted up for his reception, and another for her young pupil. You ſhall ſee miſs d'Arceville, would ſhe ſay to us, every now and then; ſhe is ſo handſome, oh! ſo very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome! I have no children, ſhe ſhall be my daughter: how pleaſed ſhall I be!</p>
               <p>I liſtened to this diſcourſe with indifference, far from thinking that this ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the evening of that ſame day, a poſt chaiſe, which drove with the greateſt rapidity, ſtopped my carriage;—four men ſtepped out—they attack me, my reſiſtance was vain:—one of them wounds me, I drop down ſenſeleſs, and only recover to ſee myſelf, bereft of my daughter. Arzelia was no more with me, Arzelia had been carried off by thoſe four ruffians. Germain, my valet, who gave me every ſuccor in his power, ſaw her ſeized and put into the poſt-chaiſe, without being able to give her the ſmalleſt aſſiſtance. In ſhort, I have loſt my dear Arzelia. I know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe has been carried! I ſtept again into my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and here you ſee me forlorn and cruelly injured!—What a fatal adventure, cried miſs d'Anfort!—and what do you think of it?—I can form no judgment whatever with any probability—the young man who inſulted me was dead; I had laid him ſprawling on the ground—Who can then have taken away my poor Arzelia?</p>
               <p>The unhappy baron yielded again to his grief, and we endeavored to conſole him, but to no purpoſe: we could not pacify him, otherwiſe than by promiſing to accompany him to the miniſter, to whom he intended to diſcloſe the whole affair, and who alone had it in his power to ſolve the problem.</p>

alighted before the Thuilleries, where count d'Anfort begged us to ſtay, till he ſhould have terminated an affair with a perſon who lived in that palace.</p>
               <p>While the count was gone, I and the baron walked about in the gardens. The baron always repeated how grievous he was at his loſs, and I endeavored, though in vain, to diſſipate his ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Night advancing, and the count not coming back, the baron, impatient of ſeeing him, intended to enquire into the cauſe which detained him.

               <p>At theſe words d'Arceville advances towards the palace; the night began to be very dark.—I went to the place where he appointed me to wait for him. Meanwhile I felt a ſecret uneaſineſs which I could not account for.—Several men of a ſuſpicious appearance ſeemed to have dogged the baron and me all the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon in the gardens. Now the baron having left me,—the ſame people followed me continually.—What could they want—did they ſuſpect me of any thing? Were they peace officers, or enemies who had formed a deſign upon my life?—Such were the reflections I made, and I was even going to ſpeak to one of them who was cloſe to me, when a carriage ſtops: two men alight, join thoſe who followed me, ſtop my mouth, ſurround and throw me in the carriage, ſit down by me, and drive on with ſuch haſte, that I had no time to know where I was.</p>
               <p>This is what I call the adventure of the <hi>Pont-tournant.</hi> Follow me, I pray: you will hear of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of ſo extraordinary a nature, as will require no leſs than the confidence you have in me to give them the ſanction of your belief.</p>

                  <p>THE DELIGHTS AND TORMENTS OF LOVE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>JUDGE of my fright and conſternation! I queſtion my guards: none of them anſwer.—Defenceleſs as I was, I could not make the leaſt reſiſtance—I was forced to wait in ſilence, the iſſue of ſo extraordinary an event—But, how I ſuffered!—You may form yourſelf an idea of my ſituation, if you only put your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a moment in my place.</p>
               <p>As far as I am able to gueſs, we rode two whole days through the country; becauſe the doors of the carriage being ſhut, I could not ſee the cities, towns and villages through which we paſſed.—My guides of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me ſome victuals which I refuſed to accept: I begged them again to let me know what they wanted of me; but they were as mute as ever.</p>
               <p>At laſt we ſtopped, and a moment after, the carriage paſſed under ſome vaults, as I gueſſed from its hollow and rattling ſounds. We alighted, in the dead of night, in a ſpacious yard, before an edifice which had more the appearance of a caſtle than a private houſe.</p>
               <p>I aſcended ſome ſteps, and entered a hall exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well illuminated; here the cloth was laid, and the table full of the moſt exquiſite viands. One of my guides aſked me to ſit down to ſupper.—No, barbarous wretch, replied I; make haſte and ſtrike your victim! We have no ſuch thoughts, ſir; will you pleaſe to eat ſomething?</p>
               <p>Always ſuppoſing the ſervant's invitation to be iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical, I refuſed. He then conducted me to another room, where the moſt diſmal ſpectacle ſuddenly engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my attention. A coffin aroſe in the middle of the apartment, which was quite hung with black. A few wax candles lighted it; an aged and ghaſtly figure of a man, melting in tears, leaned on the bier. O my ſon! cried he, thou ſhalt be revenged, not by the juſt rigor of the laws, it would be too ſlow in ſerving my fury.—Barbarous ſtranger, I will puniſh thee in a
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030364_0233_0FE5D3604D9CE4D0"/>
manner—Yes, I ſhall ſtrike thee with the ſame blow which has pierced my heart!</p>
               <p>Theſe words almoſt forced tears from my eyes!—the old man hearing a noiſe, looks around, perceives me, makes a geſture of amazement, and ſays to his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let who conducted me to him, "Awkward fellow,—What buſineſs have I with this gentleman? How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent!—Go, let him be re-conducted as you have brought him."—He looks once more about, then turns his back.</p>
               <p>You cannot conceive how much theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew words calmed me!—I, who believed myſelf deſtined to be offered up a victim to the manes of that ſon I had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er known, ſaw myſelf at once freed from danger through a miſtake made by the ſervants!—Oh, what comfort diffuſed itſelf in my heart.</p>
               <p>My guide having laid hold of my hand, made me re-enter the parlor where the table was ſo well ſerved. He invited me a third time to take ſomething. Now, I would not have him repeat it again, being no more uneaſy, and having not ate ſince two days, I ſet down without ceremony to that ſingular table, and ſupped with a very good appetite. The valet, who waited on me, expreſſed the greateſt contrition for his miſtake; I wiſhed from the bottom of my heart he would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me alone, confident to get from him ſome intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of this ſurpriſing adventure.—It happened as I wiſhed: they covered my eyes with a blind; we both ſtepped in the ſame chaiſe which had brought me, and the coachman followed the road to Paris.</p>
               <p>I did not heſitate a moment longer to urge my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to tell me what he knew in reſpect to this affair; I begged and intreated, and concluded with offering him my purſe, a reward of an hundred lous d'ors, and a place in my-houſe, if he would leave his maſter and ſatisfy my curioſity. The valet, moved with all theſe brilliant offers, accepted them, and related the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtory:</p>
               <p>"You muſt know, ſir, that my maſter's ſon, on his return from Paris, was attacked, near the city of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by a gentleman attended by a ſingle lady and a ſervant. The gentleman ſought a duel with my young
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030364_0234_0FE59AFA4ECE5820"/>
maſter, who in conſequence of it was left dead on the field, and his antagoniſt continued quietly his way in his carriage. Being buſy in lifting my young maſter from the ground, I could only remark the carriage which fled with the murderer and a lady, his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—Quite diſconſolate at this fatal event, I brought the corpſe of my maſter to his father, and told him the whole affair. After having given vent to his grief, that unhappy father ſays to me, in a reſolute tone, Wilt thou know again the villain who has bereft me of my ſon?—Yes ſir, and his carriage too.—Well, then, let us ſet out.</p>
               <p>"This ſaid, he takes with him four or five ſervants; we get into a light chaiſe and poſted away with ſuch diſpatch that we perceived in the evening the carriage we were in purſuit of, which could not go faſt, becauſe one of the horſes was wounded. We attack the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer; he reſiſts vigorouſly. My maſter pierces him; he falls, uttering the name of his daughter. His daughter, cried my maſter, ſhe ſhall die! At theſe words, he ordered us to carry her off. We were on the point of laying alſo hold of the father, when ſome horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in full gallop made us afraid of being moleſted; we therefore returned to our chaiſe, and ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted our prey to the caſtle. Since that time ſhe has been confined in a dark hole. My maſter, who ſpends day and night in bewailing his ſon, will have her to be ſacrificed upon his coffin. How ſavage! Oh! you don't know him, ſir, he is a man extremely cruel, violent, and revengeful. This is not all yet; he has me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated a ſcheme of vengeance, a thouſand times more hineous. The day before yeſterday, he gave us orders to go to Paris, to fetch the father of that unfortunate young lady. Some of us having ſeen him in the royal gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the Thuilleries!—we watched him till night and probably induced to a miſtake by your ſhape or your dreſs, which was of the ſame color as his, we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried you off inſtead of him.—Wretches, it is Arzelia!—O heaven! proceed in your ſtory! What did he want of that unhappy father?—He intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with the death of his ſon, to ſtay his daughter before his own eyes; and then, perhaps, to
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030364_0235_0FE5D3C9AD6CE418"/>
confine him for life in the dark hole of his caſtle—What a monſter!—Oh! my friend, I beg thee, if we can ſave Arzelia, I will give thee two hundred louis d'ors, three hundred—nay, my whole fortune is at thy diſpoſal!—It is not an eaſy taſk, ſir; but never mind, we muſt make intereſt with the coachman.</p>
               <p>That inſtant my man ſtops the chaiſe: we were then in a remote and ſolitary diſtrict of the country. He therefore propoſed to to the coachman either to ſave Arzelia, or to prepare for immediate death. The propoſal was very categorical; the coachman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to take the reward which is offered to him;—and we returned with the greateſt expedition to the place from whence we came, which was only at the diſtance of one league from <hi>Nevers.</hi> The night was propitious to our undertaking. The two domeſtics en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the caſtle; the coachman had the keys of the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in which the innocent Arzelia had been thrown—he calls her, lays hold of her hand, and brings her to the carriage where I waited for her with the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. Every body being aſleep in the caſtle, the eſcape was effected without any obſtacle.</p>
               <p>How impatient was I to ſee the fair captive!—ſhe finally arrives with her two deliverers—we ſtep into the chaiſe, and leave the place with the utmoſt precip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not repeat the heartfelt thanks of the baron's daughter; her grief, her misfortunes, her beauty, nay, all in her gave me the moſt tender concern: I look at her and ſuddenly my liberty is gone; I felt a ſingular revolution in my being. My eyes, my tongue, my heart, all my faculties are captivated. Surpriſed at my ſituation, I ſearch for the object which cauſes it, and as quickly aſcribe it to the concern I felt for her perſon: vague excuſe of the heart, which for the firſt time feels the power of love! indeed, what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an impulſe of compaſſion, was actually the firſt ſhoot of a riſing paſſion, which was ſoon to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an imperious domination over my heart. The charming Arzelia felt on the other hand, the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. Whether from gratitude or ſympathy, ſhe bluſhed, caſt her beauteous eyes on another object,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030364_0236_0FE5D39E158FBEB0"/>
was afraid to look in my face, and could only aſk how her father did: this confuſion, which we felt mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed ſo much on the road, that when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Paris, the leaſt diſcerning eye muſt ſurely have perceived that our ſentiments were paſt beyond the limits of friendſhip. And ſuch events have proved them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile I took care to ſend back the carriage to the cruel proprietor of the caſtle, by a ſtranger, to whom I alſo delivered a letter. I wrote to Arzelia's enemy in an anonymous manner, and without giving him any direction; I informed him of my good fortune to reſtore a daughter to a father, ſignifying that ſhould he ever attempt the leaſt method of revenge, he ought to tremble for his life; as I had it in my power to ſurrender him to juſtice, being ſupported by two indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals who had witneſſed his enormities, and by the depoſition of the innocent victim whom he intended to ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>This was indeed the expedient I ſhould have made uſe of when I firſt left the caſtle, rather than to have liberated his prey by ſtratagem; but the remedy was too violent, and I feared for the life of Arzelia, though ignorant as yet of the great loſs I would have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>We found the hotel d'Anfort in the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation. The baron and my guardian having not found me on the appointed ſpot, went home; but how aſtoniſhed was all the family, when the whole night elapſed, and I did not return!—Four days more glid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner, and they receive no intelligence from me! What could have befallen me? All en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries proved fruitleſs. The count, believing I had been murdered, ſhed real tears of ſincerity: his ſon had already worn out his grief: miſs d'Anfort was quite diſconſolate; and the baron, bereft of his daughter, without hope of ever ſeeing her again, had ſet out for the Weſt-Indies on the night before my return. When he parted from Miſs d'Anfort, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended her, his poor Arzelia, if ever ſhe ſhould be brought to light again.—You will be her mother, added he, till heaven pleaſes to ſend me back to my
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:030364_0237_0FE5D3B5003DB8C8"/>
native land! This is the ſervice I exact of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But what do I ſay?—She is loſt to me, and to you alſo—my Arzelia is loſt!—Ah! no doubt ſhe is dead!—The monſters, who raviſhed her, have made her a victim of vengeance. Adieu! my friends; far from this abode I will terminate my wretched career, the world is a wilderneſs to me, ſince my poor daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has been ſnatched from my arms!</p>
               <p>The count and miſs d'Anfort, who were alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with a grief of their own, tried, though in vain, to detain their friends: he ſat out and left them to their ſorrow.</p>
               <p>What muſt Arzelia have felt, my friends, when ſhe heard the news of her father's departure? As to my relations, the adventure which I related ſeemed ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular to them, as to heighten their joy at ſeeing me returned. My brother, alone, ſeemed not much mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but my good friend Dulys! Oh! how he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced me! how he claſped me in his arms!—O heaven! that deprives me of a father and a mother! I had never taſted the ſweets of parental fondneſs;—but how did friendſhip compenſate for them!</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, miſs d'Anfort loſt no time: the baron had given her his addreſs at the iſland of Orleron; whether ſhe immediately diſpatched a letter, with the tidings of his daughter's return; he could not as yet have completed his voyage, but muſt have received the letter upon his diſembarkation, and his ſorrows were to be at an end. This conduct of miſs d'Anfort calmed every mind. Peace reſumed her empire in the hotel; but it was not of a long continuance. My brother did not ſee the fair Arzelia with indifference; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

me; and repented the cruel renunciation he had made me ſign. It was too late, the count had the deed in his own hands; he was my guardian, and maintained over me an authority which I was not able then to ſhake off; on the other hand, I loved, I reſpected, and always trembled before him.</p>
               <p>Muſt I tell you, my friends?—Love led us aſtray: I and Arzelia contracted a clandeſtine marriage.—A country houſe belonging to miſs d'Anfort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſubſervient to that purpoſe—Thither we were gone to ſpend a few days. One morning, the count, his ſon, and miſs d'Anfort being aſleep; Arzelia, her woman, Dulys and I, repaired to the chapel of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, ſituate at the diſtance of one league from miſs d'Anfort's country ſeat.—We made intereſt with the prieſt; and an attorney was preſent at the ceremony.</p>
               <p>Dulys and a friend of his ſerved as witneſſes, and we vowed eternal tenderneſs to each other: inconſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate meaſure! Ah! how dear have we paid for it!</p>
               <p>The whole affair was conſummated in leſs than two hours. At eight o'clock, we returned to the houſe and found every body up. They made very merry at our morning walk; blamed us for not having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it the night before, as they would have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied us; and here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he whole ſubject was dropped: young d'Anfort alone took umbrage at the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. From that moment, he ſet people to watch us, and ſoon he diſcovered, if not our clandeſtine marriage, at leaſt the intimacy which ſubſiſted between us.</p>
               <p>How enraged muſt he have been! he had been fruſtrated in all the declaration of love he had made to my ſpouſe; he deteſted me, he envied my property; in fine he wiſhed me to perform the promiſe I had made in writing: and he ſaw me loved in return, and prepared for ties, to which the baron, at his return, could not object, from a ſenſe of gratitude which he owed to me, who had ſaved his daughter from the jaws of deſtruction.</p>
               <p>All the tranſports of hatred, jealouſy, rage and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, ſeized upon his heart:—he began with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his father and aunt of all he knew, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried matters ſo far as to require them to put me in
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:030364_0239_0FE5D3B68DA8BC10"/>
confinement, and to throw Arzelia in a convent;—violent and impracticable proceedings, no doubt, but two moderate for the inſult which he pretended to have received.</p>
               <p>The count heard his ſon with all the coolneſs of a man of ripe and fair experience; he repreſented to him the unreaſonableneſs of having recourſe to ſimilar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, and adviſed gentler means. The young man at theſe wiſe counſels, wept, howled, plucked off his hair, and threatened to kill himſelf if his father would not treat me with the utmoſt rigor and ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity! The old man, intimidated, conſoled his ſon, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to diſcard his gloomy reſolution, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do every thing.—What weakneſs! In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, miſs d'Anfort received orders to ſpeak to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelia; and the count propoſed himſelf to take me to taſk.</p>
               <p>We were wholly ignorant of the chevalier's arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and I imagined our loves were a perfect myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery! What was my ſurpriſe, when one day my guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ordered me to his cabinet, and addreſſed me with the following ſpeech, in a prudent but moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate tone:</p>
               <p>"I know all, ſir, I know you adore miſs d'Arceville, it will meet every deſired return.—What is to be the end of that intrigue? anſwer me: a mere piece of gallantry: it will not do!—A marriage, you know, you have denied yourſelf that ſtate! What do you pretend, then, ſir? If you have the leaſt ſenſe of gratitude for the care I have taken of you, the leaſt ſentiment of reſpect for the authority which your mother conferred on me, I command you never to ſpeak to that young lady, and to ſet out immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Beſancon to join your regiment in winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.—By that time your juvenile follies will ſubſide, and you will perhaps forget Arzelia, who is deſtined for your brother!—For my brother, ſir?—Yes, for your brother. He ſhall firſt have my life!—Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent young man! dare you to threaten him before his father?—Do you know that I have it in my power to enforce means?—Be what they will, ſir, I fear them not; Arzelia loves me, I adore her: and you can if you pleaſe return me a premiſe which my
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:030364_0240_0FE5D3CA7217BEE8"/>
age has invalidated. The promiſe is fair, the laws ſhall decide it. Laws are not tyrants!—You behave yourſelf diſreſpectfully, audacious youth! Depart, fear my anger, or you are undone!—But, ſir,—Depart, I ſay, or I'll make you obey!"</p>
               <p>The count frowns at me, and leaves me to my grief—I go out in hopes to ſee my ſpouſe—I find her melting in tears. Ah! cries ſhe, ſpeak to me no more! our life is at ſtake! Miſs d'Anforth, I will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice myſelf for you! only wait my father's return.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, miſs d'Anforth appears: they both ſtep in a carriage and I ſee my unfortunate ſpouſe depart, without knowing whither ſhe is conducted, or if we ſhall ever meet again!</p>
               <p>I kindled with rage; and I endeavored to follow the carriage; the ſervants hinder me.—I run up and down the houſe, called aloud for my brother, and had he appeared, I believe his life would have been loſt.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, heaven preſerved me from that crime; it ſent Dulys to be my comforter. Dulys came, I told him all that had happened; and aſked his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. My friend, anſwered he, I have no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to give you, than to obey your ſtep-father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; go, and ſtay for ſome time at Beſancon. This will give me time to do for you what ever ſhall be in my power: I will endeavor to appeaſe every mind: depart, my dear marquis, and leave to my care your happineſs. I ſhall diſcover the retreat of your ſpouſe; I ſhall ſee her: ſhe ſhall hear of you, and an epiſtolary correſpondence ſhall be eſtabliſhed. We have both been guilty of imprudence with regard to that fatal renunciation; but it is not valid—it wants a clauſe;—it becomes uſeleſs to your tyrants.—I'll convince you of it ſome other time, now depart; this ſubmiſſion will perhaps have a better effect than your menaces.</p>
               <p>I ſet out loaded with the reproaches of the count and miſs d'Anfort. I arrived at Beſancon; and on the next morning received a letter from Dulys, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that my wife was confined in a convent, in the <hi>Rue d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

cajoled and threatened her into it, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak to her, but time would ſoon be productive of a change.</p>
               <p>This news overwhelmed me with deſpair; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my friend's letter, and was a little more eaſy.</p>
               <p>One day I received a very long letter from Dulys, which made me completely miſerable; I cannot help giving you ſome extracts from it, becauſe nothing can eraſe it from my memory.</p>
               <p>My friend, miſs d'Anfort has received letters from the iſland of Oleron, that baron d'Arceville was dead!—He was ſcarce arrived, but he received the letter, purporting his daughter's return; his joy was ſo exceſſive that he could only write theſe few lines, of which I ſend you a copy:</p>

                     <p>That faithful meſſenger is arrived: he delivered into miſs d'Anfort's hands, property to a very great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount. Thus Arzelia muſt ſolely depend on her for a maintenance. Alas! how I pity you!</p>

               <p>At this, my friends, I could not moderate my tranſ-Ports! I doubted no longer of Arzelia's infidelity, and reſolved that inſtant, to ſet off for Paris. There, ſaid I, by myſelf I will diſcover my marriage, and ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs from juſtice of the laws.</p>
               <p>I had now been eight months at Beſancon, and compelled by duty to ſtay one week longer. I fixed my departure for the Monday following.

reflection; ſhe perſeveres in her ſolicitations—I rebuke her again. I go, ſaid ſhe, but heaven will puniſh you! Heaven! exclaimed I, what a reſemblance! what a voice! Arzelia! Yes, ungrateful marquis! it is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelia!—I wiſhed to ſee if you would know me. But how!—in ſuch an appearance? To it I owe the bliſs of ſeeing you again.

               <p>Her ſuppoſition was juſt: ſhe goes with me to my lodgings, ſits down, and gives me an account of what had happened to her, which my tranſports of joy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted an hundered times.</p>
               <p>"Forced by the advice and threats of miſs d'Anfort, I followed her to a convent, where ſhe left me, giving orders to the mother abbeſs, not to ſuffer any body to converſe with me. The next day ſhe came to ſee me again, and was exact in her viſits every ſubſequent day. I wiſh you had ſeen her in our converſations, how ſhe extolled the chevalier's merits, and every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to repreſent you as vicious.

                  </gap>res. I hope you will not be his ruin. D'Anfort will much better ſerve your purpoſe. He is a fine youth of eighteen, well made, and his heart and mind are equally excellent—moreover, d'Anfort will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich: I ſhall make him my ſole heir; with him, my dear, you will be happier.</p>
               <p>"This diſcourſe rouſed my indignation; but I was too much afraid ſhe would gueſs our ſecret, had I then given her a deciſive anſwer. From that inſtant, Miſs d'Anfort imagined ſhe had conquered my heart for her nephew; and when ſhe informed me of the death of my father, ſhe dwelt chiefly upon that paſſage of the letter, where he ordered me, ſaid ſhe, to give the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier your hand. I ſaw him every day with her, and they became ſo aſſiduous and intruding, that I had ſcarcely time to peruſe your letters: I dared not to anſwer them, leſt I ſhould confide in a perſon that might betray me. The ſervant whom Mr. Dulys ſent might have been prevailed upon to take a bribe, and
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:030364_0244_0FE5D3D288DC2488"/>
we would have been undone.—I had alſo another motive to be cautious againſt my tyrants—dear huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, I am pregnant!—O God! Yes, my dear, I expect every minute to bring to light that precious pledge: and this made me eſcape from my priſon, and meet you here!—My dear ſpouſe, how was you able to effect that eſcape? Oh, it was a bold expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent! but it proved ſucceſsful.—An unfortunate and very poor old woman came often to beg alms of the nuns; ſhe conceived ſo great an attachment for me, as to ſpend whole days in my apartment: I liked her, and was much entertained with her wit and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I thought her a fit inſtrument to deliver my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſlavery. In conſequence I told her my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and from the concern which ſhe ſeemed to feel for me, I requeſted her to change her dreſs for mine, or rather to bring one like that ſhe had on, and to lend me her own. She agreed to my demand. Thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipped, and fearing to bring the poor woman into trouble on my account. I let her go out before me. When I ſaw through my window, that ſhe was at a good diſtance in the ſtreets, I ventured myſelf down ſtairs in the ſame dreſs, in hopes to make my eſcape. The good old woman uſed to come to and fro ſo often in a day, that the domeſtics were accuſtomed to it.—I ſtooped, pulled my cap over my noſe, and paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the porter, even took care to make a crooked bow, which made the fellow laugh. Well, mother, ſaid he, you juſt went out, how did you get in?—Without loſing a minute by giving him an anſwer, I advanced, and as ſoon as I was in the ſtreet, run as hard as I could to the poſt-office, where I prepared myſelf to ſet out without delay. The poſt-maſter made ſome difficulty, but dazzling him with my gold, he could no longer withſtand my demand. I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under this diſguiſe all the way, for ſear of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Now I ſee thee again, my dear huſband, I am no longer grieved."</p>
               <p>I embraced Arzelia, and begged her to take ſome ſuſtenance. Meanwhile I feared the purſuits of our tyrants. We of courſe determined to take other lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the next day, or rather to leave the town. But
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:030364_0245_0FE5D38AA37E26B0"/>
all theſe projects were ſubverted by our friend Dulys, who entered our apartment in the dead of night, and had but time to utter theſe few words:—Fly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate couple, the count and his ſon are at my heels!</p>
               <p>Arzelia ſwooned: I went to her aſſiſtance, but ſo violent was the effect of her panic, that ſhe was deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered of a child! how embarraſſing was my ſituation! I had no light, my door was open, I take my little Alexis in my arms!—Several voices cry: Where are they?—Where are they? Dulys leaves the room, to keep off my tyrants. I attempt to ſhut my door.—A man oppoſes me, enters, in ſpite of me, tears the child from my arms, and endeavors to run away. I become quite frantic, and ſuddenly take my ſword: <hi>Treacherous d'Anfort! Thou ſhalt be puniſhed!</hi> I purſue the man who carries off my child, overtake him at the bottom of the ſtairs, thruſt the ſteel in his body, and retake the new-born infant. Heaven! what terror ſtruck me!—I heard a dying voice: <hi>Cruel Corſange! Could'ſt thou ſlay thy friend, when he ſaved thee?</hi> It was the voice of Dulys! it was Dulys I ſtabbed!—O remorſe!</p>
               <p>Meanwhile this noiſe had ſpread the alarm among the ſervants of the inn; they come up ſtairs, followed by count d'Anfort and his ſon!—What muſt have been my feelings, when, lights being brought, I ſaw Dulys ſprawling on the ground, and weltering in his blood! Heaven! that dreadful ſcene is ſtill before mine eyes! My guardian and his ſon are moved; they ſtop and raiſe the unfortunate victim. He is put to bed; a ſurgeon is ſent for, he gives us ſome hopes, by aſſuring us that his wound was not mortal.</p>

The unhappy mother was ignorant of my crime: I took care to conceal it from her, and ſhe knew it only two months after.</p>
               <p>The count and his ſon remained at the inn as long as my ſpouſe was forced to keep her bed. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided ſeeing us, and we were rejoiced at it.

Our marriage was void by law; the count had a right to have it diſſolved; but, on the other hand, he was much at a loſs to prove the legality of the deed he had made me ſign, becauſe a gentleman of the law who had been conſulted, convinced him of its nullity, becauſe it had been made in haſte, and by an ignorant attorney. I certaintly promiſed never to marry; but then I was only twenty, and it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that I ſhould ratify the promiſe when I came to be of age. As ſuch, the deed would have been valid. The count, who knew all this, endeavored to intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date me, though he was conſcious that it was out of his power to hurt me; as for my own part, I was afraid leſt he ſhould diſſolve my marriage; we were, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, forced to adopt gentle means on both ſides.</p>

The day before my departure from Beſancon, he entered my apartment alone: "Corſange," ſaid he you are ſtill dear to me; I loved your mother: ſhe has entruſted you to my care; ſhe ordered you to obey me as you would have obeyed her; and even to grant me all your confidence. Undutiful ſon!—Have you reſpected her commands?—You have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a clandeſtine marriage, and violated the moſt ſacred engagements! Hear me, I will be candid with you: I am old; folks at my age are ambitious; I ought to have that ambition.—I cheriſh the moſt lovely ſon, his fortune and advancement lies cloſeſt to my heart; but you diſappoint my hopes. It is your brother!—Who can be dearer to you than he?—Did you but love each other, I would be happy. In a word, love and intereſt have ſeparated you; make me happy again: O! my ſecond ſon, make me happy again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Reſpected ſir, it is my earneſt deſire; but, what ſacrifice do you exact of me? "Hear me; your marriage is illegal, of this you cannot entertain the leaſt ſhadow of a doubt.—I have it in my power to diſſolve it; but I will not have recourſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. Live with your wife: I permit it; but give me up your ſon, dear Corſange, and be ſure that I ſhall train him up with the tenderneſs of a real father: the only thing I require, is to conceal from him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his name and family. This complaiſance in you will inſure you the poſſeſſion of your ſpouſe, and I promiſe to deſtroy the deed which now is in my hands. You know I can ruin you, and make you an object of poverty and diſgrace. Conſent to your happineſs, dear friend.—Every day you ſhall ſee that ſon; but never ſhall he know his father: this is the ſole reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triction I wiſh to lay him under."</p>
               <p>The old man's diſcourſe was captious; but it could not dazzle me. I pryed inſtantly into his policy, and was ſenſible that ſhould I be ſo weak as to yield up the offspring of my union, my ſpouſe would be ſnatched from me in the ſame manner, and that my compliance would become a manifeſt diſavowal of the deareſt titles conferred on me by nature and love; beſides, was it not, perhaps diſpoſing of my ſon's life? I did not

fear the count; but the chevalier was, in my opinion, capable of every crime; nevertheleſs, I found it then ſeaſonable to diſſemble. I ſeemingly acquieſced in my guardian's deſign, and promiſed to put my child under his care, after our return from Paris, where Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys kept him under his protection. D'Anfort, calmed by my ultimatum, communicated it to my brother, who was equally ſatisfied; ſo that we all four ſat out with apparent content. Arzelia, who conſidered it as the ſum of wretchedneſs to be parted from her ſon, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded my views, and we both hoped to find ſome ſubterfuge for not delivering our Alexis into thoſe cruel hands, which intended to deprive us of what we held deareſt on earth.</p>
               <p>What was our grief when we arrived in the metrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olis! Dulys! my dear unfortunate Dulys was no more! The fatigues of a premature journey, and the embarraſſments under which he ſaw himſelf for our ſake, had brought on a ſlow diſtemper; his wounds re-opened, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>An old houſekeeper of that relation, who had obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my grief, and heard ſome exclamations, took me in private one day: "Sir, ſaid ſhe, are you not uneaſy about a little child?" Alas! my good woman, could you give me any intelligence? "Here, ſir, my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's nephew entruſted me with this letter, a moment before his death, and ordered me not to give it to any perſon but you."

You will find it ſo in the pariſh book of the church of Vitry; but believe me, bring him up ſecretly, and make your tyrants believe he is dead; this is the laſt advice of your expiring friend Dulys—He might have been able to render you more ſervices ſtill dearer to his heart, if your hand—But I grieve you, I ſharpen the ſting of your remorſe.—Pray forget me, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give yourſelf my untimely end, as I forgive it you!

               <p>I imprinted a thouſand kiſſes on this letter, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired my friend's generoſity, who had ſtill my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt at heart, even when my barbarity cauſed his death!—How all this aggravated my guilt! How I abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red myſelf!—Arzelia ſhared my ſorrows, and we both gave tears to the moſt feeling and moſt generous man, who, perhaps ever exiſted on earth!</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, I was determined to follow the laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Dulys, and, however repugnant I found it to diſſemble, I yielded to neceſſity. In conſequence, I and Arzelia ſpread the report of the death of our friend and the child; and our ſorrow, of which Dulys was the ſole object, appeared ſo natural to count d'Anfort and his ſon, that they believed it, and made no farther enquiries.</p>
               <p>We lived five years in our hotel, <hi>Rue de Richelieu,</hi> not without finding that the count and his family had for us a great regard. In compliance with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, I and my ſpouſe inhabited each a different a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. I might as well have freed Arzelia from that reſtraint; but the fear of a law-ſuit, which we ſhould have been forced to ſtand, in order to have our marriage confirmed, made us wait till the death of the count d'Anfort ſhould remove that obſtacle.</p>
               <p>I was afraid of going too often to Vitry; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted my ſon's nurſe with the ſecret of his birth; and leſt the little innocent ſhould betray himſelf one day, I had him brought up by the name of Alexis, and would not permit the leaſt hint, with regard to his family, ſhould be given him. Thus I hoped to enjoy the ſweets of a tranquil life, when a certain circumſtance came to

rouſe my prudence, and overthrow all my projects. I was one day walking with the count and his ſon, in the yard of the hotel, when a milk-maid, who came from the kitchen, ſtops, ſtares at me, and cries out with a <hi>naivet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I ſay, my lord—I beg your pardon!—O good God!—if he was his father! Whoſe father? Why, we have a little child at Vitry—he is an orphan, and ſuch a pretty boy! he is abſolutely like my lord there! Sure, the woman is mad, replied I—What is there to be wondered at?—Many folks reſemble each other. I beg your pardon, my lord;—my little Alexis! he is ſo pretty!—Ah, you cannot think.</p>
               <p>The milk-maid was going to continue her chat, which wounded my ſoul, I take, without ceremony, the father and ſon, to another part of the premiſes, and endeavor to change the ſubject of the converſation; but my confuſion had betrayed me. A ray of light came to illuminate their mind; they began to ſuſpect the cheat, and growing cooler by degrees, left me, no doubt, to conſult what meaſures they ſhould adopt in that conjuncture. I was fortunate enough to read their deſign in their eyes, and, without loſing time, I mount on horſeback, fly to Vitry, take away my ſon, and bring him to the Royal Botanical Garden, neither knowing what to do, or where to hide him. It was twilight, and not choſing to paſs through the ſtreets of Paris with ſo precious a treaſure, I determined to enter the garden, and concert ſome means of conduct in my preſent dilemma. I was ſitting on the turf, in the little grove; my ſon was in my lap; I bathed him in my tears, and preſſed him to my heart, when an old lady ſtops, looks at me, and addreſſes me as follows, in ſo moving a tone, which tore my ſecret from me, even in ſpite of myſelf. Alas! my dear ſir, are you the father of this pretty child? Yes madam. What a lovely little creature!—But you weep, have you met with ſome ſiniſtrous accident? Oh! I have indeed!

               <p>This converſation, my friends, overwhelmed me with ſhame and confuſion! To claim the ſupport of a woman, who is the mother of the friend I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated! The mother of the friend whoſe proceedings were moſt generous! Far from denouncing my guilt to his family, he had that grandeur of ſpirit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion my name only to be my eulogium. O God! I was then in one of thoſe indeſcribable ſituations which can only be felt.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dulys ſeeing me turn pale, aſked me the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my confuſion.

Such a diſſimulation laid, however, hard upon my feelings.

               <argument>
                  <p>THE FATHER OF ALEXIS CONCLUDES HIS NARRATIVE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE count's whole houſe was now in confuſion: The chevalier, my inveterate enemy, juſt arrived from Vitry; he had threatened the good nurſe in ſuch a manner, as made her confeſs the whole affair. He heard, that a few minutes before his arrival, I had taken away my ſon, but was ignorant of the place to which I had conducted him. Having therefore had a council with his father and aunt, they unanimonſly reſolved, that Miſs d'Anfort ſhould conduct Arzelia to a caſtle, ſituate in the environs of St. Germain, and there keep her a priſoner till I ſhould have delivered up my ſon, the object of their common hatred and purſuits. I was not informed of this new diſaſter, till the two ladies were gone. Nevertheleſs, Arzelia found means to ſend ſecretly a few lines to me, in which ſhe hinted that it was time for us to free ourſelves from the controul of our tyrants; ſhe alſo ſent me a gold repeater, which ſhe begged me to look at every hour, that I might remember her.</p>
               <p>We were really intimidated to the higheſt degree: Why ſhould not we have courage to ſhake off the chains in which our three cruel tyrants held us fettered?—Indeed, the fear of ſeeing our marriage diſſolved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained us; this apprehenſion, and the deed of renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which I had ſigned, and of whoſe invalidity we were ſtill ignorant, bade us ſo much defiance, that we even dared not to conſult a lawyer, for fear of making ourſelves liable to a law-ſuit, whoſe final iſſue we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as very fatal.</p>
               <p>Thus I was forced to bear this ſeparation, without making the leaſt complaint; but I found means, by the adroitneſs of ſuggeſtion of Mrs. Dulys, to inform my ſpouſe my Alexis was ſafe. At night, when every body had retired to reſt in the hotel, I mounted my courſer, and fled to the caſtle d'Anfort, near St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. An avenue of trees conducted to its entrance, and was covered with gravel. I contented myſelf with
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:030364_0254_0FE5D3D7866FFAD0"/>
tracing in large characters upon the gravel the word <hi>well!</hi> I ſet out immediately after, reached the hotel before day break, and went to bed, not to incur any ſuſpicion. Every morning, Arzelia left the caſtle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of a walk, for which ſhe choſe the av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enue, alledging, that ſhe liked it better than the park. There ſhe read what I had written over night, and ſometimes made uſe of the ſame expedient to let me know her thoughts. It was utterly impoſſible for her to write, or to find means of conveying letters to me, becauſe miſs d'Anfort never left her an inſtant. Thus we lived, till the moment when I ſent my ſon to the college of Navarre, where I put him under your care, Mr. Dumont: I ſaw you; your phyſiognomy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced an honeſt man, and you have not deceived me!—It was then that affairs took a different turn at caſtle d'Anfort.</p>
               <p>Miſs d'Anfort, who could not conceive how I could live parted from my ſpouſe without ſeeing her, even without enquiring after her, (for ſhe was ignorant of my nocturnal excurſions) began to let her enjoy more liberty: ſhe changed her lodging, and aſſigned her another more gay and pleaſant, in the front of the firſt yard of the caſtle, quite adjoining to her own. This made my ſpouſe invent a ſcheme of receiving me by night, unknown to every body. It was a bold ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem; and the more ludicrous, as we made it ſucceed. After a written inſtruction of the intentions of my ſpouſe, which ſhe flung over the walls, I behaved in the following manner.</p>
               <p>Miſs d'Antfort uſed to ſend every day to St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, a large covered cart, loaden with the ſundry productions of her garden. James, the driver, a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, harmleſs boor, ſold them upon the market place, and returned to the caſtle every night at twelve. It came into our mind to make uſe of that man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ourſelves without his knowledge, the pleaſure of ſeeing and converſing with one another, and for that end concerted theſe meaſures:</p>
               <p>Champaign, my valet, diſguiſed himſelf one day as a countryman; he knew the inn at St. Germains, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> put up every night; thither he repairs,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:030364_0255_0FE5D36D928BC1C8"/>
enters in converſation with him, propoſes a bottle, and makes him boozy. At midnight, James wants to return; I will accompany you, anſwers Champaign, for I have now to go a league beyond the caſtle. While they are on the way, the clown leaves the cart a hundred yards behind him. I mount and ſquat in it. Before the gate of the caſtle, Champaign wiſhes his comrad a good night. Will you come this way, in the morning? aſks James. Yes, at four o'clock. Aye, we'll go together to my miſtreſs's great kitchen garden, it is not a quarter of a league from here, I take my cart there every morning, I ſpend the day with the gardener, and in the evening I go to St. Germain, where I get very good cuſtomers for the garden ſtuff. Well, if that's the caſe, we'll meet often, becauſe I come this way every day.</p>
               <p>Our men part, James conducts his carriage into the yard, unteams his horſes, takes them into the ſtables, and goes to bed. He is no ſooner gone, than a woman makes her appearance, and comes to me in the cart. It is Arzelia! What tranſports! What charming and painful moments! We could only entertain ourſelves with the tale of our woes. At three in the morning, Arzelia returns to her apartment. James comes back, puts his horſes to the cart, and carries me back as he brought me. Champaign ſtands waiting for him at the gate: mutual civilities are paſſing; and, drinking is the favorite topic. Whilſt they enter a public houſe de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ched from the highway, I jump out of the cart, and run to a neighboring inn, where my truſty Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign ſoon comes to join me. We both mount our horſes, and reach the hotel before ſix.</p>
               <p>You muſt grant, we expoſed ourſelves much! Well, we carried on the ſtratagem two whole years, with as much ſucceſs as on the firſt day. Honeſt James even contracted ſuch an intimacy with Champaign, that he would be ſorry to have miſſed him a ſingle night. This my Alexis is the enigma of the gold repeater, of which I made you a preſent; and, which I could not explain, without coming to ſuch illuſtrations, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity required us both to avoid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="unknown:030364_0256_0FE5D3DBEE3135E8"/>
Now, my ſon, I ſhall make a digreſſion to relate the cataſtrophe which made me be ſo barbarous to you; it was the inſtrument of my preſent happineſs. You ſhall ſee how forcibly maliciouſneſs operates upon a feeble heart, at the ſame time naturally inclined to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion.</p>
               <p>Before I enter upon my narration, I ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize the events ſecondary to it: events which did not reach my knowledge till long after. Count d'Anfort once having a reſtleſs night, riſes with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to walk about the premiſes; a mere motive of curioſity leads him towards the ſtables; he is ſurpriſed to find the door open, and ſtill more ſurpriſed upon entering, to find my own and ſervant's horſe miſſing; What is all this? is Corſange fled? The Count wakes all the domeſtics, intimidate them by his threats, and is informed that I leave the hotel every night, and do not return till ſix in the morning. The count, who wanted no penetration, ſuſpects me of going to St. Germain, and of having apparently found means to get acceſs to my ſpouſe. His indignation is kindled, he calls his ſon; both mount their horſes, and reach the caſtle about ſeven. They fail not to load Miſs d'Anfort with a thouſand reproaches, though the poor lady knew not why. Equally fired with indignation, ſhe promiſes to uſe all efforts to bring the matter to a diſcovery. James had often mentioned among the domeſtics, his good friend, who went every night with him to St. Germain, treated him with wine, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each new morn to regale him afreſh. Miſs d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſuſpected, that this good friend of James, could perhaps be myſelf or one of my men. She ordered James an eſcort of two tall and ſtout laborers for the enſuing night—Theſe have orders to ſeize James's good friend, and bring him before her. Theſe orders are executed:—Champaign is caught, and brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that old daemon, who knows him at firſt ſight. After many threats and offers of reward, ſhe tears from that faithleſs valet, a confeſſion of our nocturnal interviews:—ſhe alſo inquires for the place where my ſon was concealed; but Champaign can give no ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction on that part of his examination, becauſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:030364_0257_0FE5D3457055D338"/>
it is the only thing I have concealed from him. Miſs d'Anfort, in a furious tranſport, meditates a cruel revenge, and eaſily prevails upon that ſordid wretch to become her accomplice. Oh heaven! why are there ſouls ſo baſe as to become tools to the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal manoeuvres of the great, though ever ſure to fall either ſooner or later victims of their guilt. This was the lot of Champaign.</p>
               <p>Not ſuſpecting their horrid deſigns, I arrived at St. Germain at the uſual hour, and was not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at finding neither James nor my valet.—I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire without any ceremony, and am informed they went away half an hour before my arrival. Amazed at what could make them be in ſuch a hurry, I advance to the gate of caſtle d'Anfort, and ſtand waiting. Half an hour after, out comes Champaign. Ah, ſir, ſaid this wretch, I bring ſad news for you! How ſo? The counteſs had me called up by James, and told me this: Go Champaign, go and tell the marquis that I am heartily tired of the ſlavery in which I am held for his ſake. I beg him not to ſee me again, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he need not think of me any more, becauſe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune forces us to part. O heaven!—Is it poſſible? I wiſh to God it were not!—but, my dear maſter, to give you a convincing proof, I can ſhow you the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhe made me, to acknowledge, ſhe ſaid, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I had taken. "Here, Champaign," added ſhe, "here is a purſe of twenty-five louis d'ors, rely always on my gratitude; but have nothing more to do with this affair. All is over, I am determined to leave the marquis forever!"</p>
               <p>I leave you to think what impreſſion this diſcourſe of Champaign made upon me.—Far was I from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his treachery; and, beſides, his report, as to appearances, had too, much the tincture of truth, that I ſhould have called it into queſtion.—Grief over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms me; I break forth in reproaches and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations upon the perfidious Arzelia, and return home with a bleeding heart.</p>
               <p>Two days after, I receive, by a ſervant of miſs d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, a billet from my ſpouſe, to the following purport:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="unknown:030364_0258_0FE5D3DE2075DC38"/>
"All is over, my friend: follow the only reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advice I have in my power to give you; it is to fly from me till heaven pleaſe to diſpoſe matters more favorably."</p>
               <p>This laconic billet confirmed me in my fatal opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I imagine that Arzelia, impatient of ſlavery, would break her chain and renounce me forever!—What inconſtancy!—what perfidiouſneſs! For ſeveral months theſe cruel ideas have haunted my fancy, and I got rid of this ſituation only to be involved in a more deplorable one! Champaign, (for he was always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty) accoſts me one morning, and, with a moſt bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſmal air, ſays: Alas, ſir, how will you ſtand the blow I am going to ſtrike? What blow? Gather all the energy and ſtrength in your ſoul to hear me!—Arzelia—Well, Arzelia—has proved faithleſs to your bed. Faithleſs, traitor!—dareſt thou? Yes, ſir, your friend Dulys, who is dead, had gained her graces and affections. Villain, tremble! Don't be in a paſſion, my good maſter! I can prove it, prove it ſo as to ſtrike you into conviction!—James, whom I ſee every day, and who is now in our intereſt and confidence, has found two days ago in the place where Arzelia has been ſitting, this portrait and this letter, which he ſaw her kiſs ſeveral times.</p>
               <p>I was quite creſt fallen, when I really ſaw the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of Dulys, and at the bottom, the following words, in my wife's own hand writing: <hi>Him I ſhall never forget!</hi> Gods! What a ray of light ſtrikes the horizon of my underſtanding!—I haſtily peruſe the letter, it comes from Dulys himſelf; I know his hand!—What are the contents?</p>
               <p>"Take care to conceal the ſecret from every eye, moſt worthy and beloved lady!—Let this offspring of the moſt faithful union, be delivered to me alone.—Prevent every ſuſpicion of the marquis—his paſſion might be productive of the moſt fatal effects—indeed, who is intitled more than I to the right of receiving that lovely infant! Farewell, I have given you full inſtructions!—Take care, above all, that nobody diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers our ſecret correſpondence."</p>
               <p>An hundred times I re-peruſe that fatal letter; I look for expreſſions which might deſtroy my ſuſpicion,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:030364_0259_0FE59AFDC8956EF8"/>
I only find ſuch as ſerve to confirm it!—For, conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er well!—was it not a manifeſt proof of the treachery of Dulys and my ſpouſe? Such a letter, and from my friend's own hand; for his hand it was, and I had well examined it.—Suddenly, I recollect the ſpeed which Dulys made to reach Beſancon, his zeal in ſnatching the child from my arms, to carry it to Paris, as it were, without my conſent, and to have it chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and educated there! Add to this, the ſilence of my ſpouſe in the convent, and the very letters of my friend, which ſeemed to have no other tendency, than to alienate my own heart from Arzelia; all this was like ſo many proofs to corroborate the ſelf ſpeaking ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence before my eyes!—She never told me, that ſhe had the potrait of Dulys in her poſſeſſion,—All theſe reflections made ſuch an impreſſion upon me, that I found my affections ſuddenly detached from my ſpouſe and ſon. Methinks a veil dropped from mine eyes jealouſy fired my weak heart, and I was fooliſh enough to go and aſk my guardian queſtions on that ſubject, he having ſo often railed at me for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Dulys, and the intimacy which I ſuffered him to keep up with my ſpouſe. The count is a man of ſound judgment, ſaid I; he is incapable of baſe calumny!—I was upon the point of going up to his apartment, when I ſaw him come towards me. Pray, what means that kind of a tomb, ſaid he, which your ſpouſe has erected in a grove of her park?—My ſiſter made me remark it:—What, is Arzelia going mad? How, a tomb? Yes, indeed, one would think ſhe is a widow!—She ſpends right and day before it, moaning and uttering the name of Dulys! Yes, Dulys: he was a rare friend, I declare, well may ſhe be ſorry for him; but, by the bye, ſhe carries her ſorrow too far.</p>
               <p>When the count had ſaid theſe words, I withdraw for fear of hearing more, and my heart wrung with grief; I retire to my apartment, weeping moſt bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!—Every thought adds to my deſpair. When Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelia ſpoke of Dulys, it was always with ſuch warmth, with ſuch animation—he was the pattern of men, the moſt amiable and moſt perfect of mortals!—Alexis
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:030364_0260_0FE5D3DEEE51D578"/>
owed him his preſervation, &amp;c. all ſeemed to evince the poſſibility of Arzelia's crime.</p>
               <p>At laſt, my friends, I formed the barbarous project of getting rid of Alexis, who, on a ſudden, became odious to me; nothing could move me, neither his ſtrict reſemblance of me, which I deemed the effect of hazard, his tenderneſs, nor his virtues!—I ſent for Mr. Dumont, to meet me in Luxembourg gardens, and you know the orders, I gave him.</p>
               <p>Thus I lived for a conſiderable time without ſeeing my wife, or even without enquiring after her, and, my tyrants, to whom I had owned my having parted with the child, yet, without telling them what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, were tolerably ſatisfied with the appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſucceſs of their ſtratagem, till one day I ſaw them both come home very much fatigued. We have ſeen him, ſaid the chevalier to me, his eyes glancing with fierceneſs, we have ſeen to day Mr. Dulys' ſon! Where? In the royal Botanical Garden—He is very tall! but, brother, as you are ſo ſure that he is not your ſon, why do you ſuffer him to be thus in Paris? What is it to me where he is? Very true, but is not he chriſtened by your name? he may diſcover you ſome day, and force you to acknowledge him for your ſon; put him out of the way, join with us, we will ſend him to the Weſt-Indies. To the Weſt-Indies!—Never! Whence that blind tenderneſs?—he is either your ſon, or a ſtranger's! But ſir, what proof have I that he is not my ſon? Why did you reject him, then? Alas, I don't know—who will explain me that cruel enigma?</p>
               <p>You ſee, my friends, I was always wavering between doubt and certainty—You tremble! you deteſt me! well, I deſerve it! This circumſtance of my hiſtory does me no honor: it is my crime, my only crime! it will ever be my torment! Happy if my ſpouſe and ſon will ever condeſcend, if not to forget it, at leaſt not to call it to my remembrance?</p>
               <p>When I left the count and his ſon, I perceived they had ſome project.—My tenderneſs for Alexis returned and as I never loſt ſight of him, I engaged that ſame Champaign, that monſter of a traitor, to carry him a letter and purſe from me. Whether or not Champaign
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:030364_0261_0FE5D348B3B86AE0"/>
followed my advice, I know not. Nevertheleſs, the inſtant you left the capital, the count and his ſon had already got notice, that you was going to Valence. Is it poſſible for a man to be thus cruelly deceived?</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the criſis approached which was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide my fate, and re unite Arzelia with her ungrateful ſpouſe!</p>
               <p>Long ſince, miſs d'Anfort had foſtered a tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for me. This particular, which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to mention, has been partly the cauſe of all our misfortunes. That vindictive and jealous termagant had declared her paſſion twenty times; and twenty times I treated it with indignation, and contempt. Her paſſion, my diſdain, my union with Arzelia, all had rendered her my deadly fiend—ſo that ſhe took delight to be our torment, and uſed every effort to bring me to the point where ſhe deſired to ſee me.</p>
               <p>On the evening of the ſame day, when you left Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris to go to Valence, I was never more aſtoniſhed than to ſee her alight at my houſe! ſhe, who kept my ſpouſe a priſoner in her caſtle; ſhe, in a word, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as more deſpicable than her brother and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew. My dear Corſange, ſaid ſhe with an air of ſweetneſs, I doubt not you are ſurpriſed at my viſit; I come to do you ſome ſervice; only hear me.</p>
               <p>I know all; the count and his ſon have ſeen Alexis in the king's garden; you have ordered him inſtantly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uit Paris; he has taken the road to Dauphiny; in ſhort, I know all; but what you don't know is, that my brother has this very afternoon obtained a <hi>littre de cachet</hi> from the miniſter, to have him taken up with his preceptor for two vagabonds, and as ſuch they will be ſent to the Baſtile—Heaven!—Stop, I will ſave them, if you chuſe. Pray, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

How, madam! They are juſt gone to Valence. But what a barbarity!—With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my conſent? Let us not loſe a moment; I have got a poſt chaiſe waiting below.—Let us join them.—
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:030364_0262_0FE5D3E68D7C1E30"/>
I have uſed all my endeavors to break their reſolution, but to no purpoſe. Ah, madam, what concern can you have for a child, which is fully proved not to be my own? Very true; I have forced Arzelia ſince to own it;—but that youth is only unfortunate, and not guilty; ought we to undo him? Madam, I don't go to ſave him, but poor Mr. Dumont, his worthy preceptor, who is involved in his miſery! What, will you ſuffer him to be carried off? Let him depart, be his fate what it will!—but that honeſt man, who is attached to him much!—Well, let us ſet off, my dear; you do well!—Let them exerciſe their rage upon Alexis, and we will ſave the honeſt man in queſtion.</p>
               <p>So great was my perplexity, and ſo importunate miſs d'Anfort, that, without further reflection, I ſlept in the poſt-chaiſe; miſs d'Anfort places herſelf next me, my footman and Champaign mount behind, and the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whips away. It was but ſome time after I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my companion.—I expreſſed my ſurpriſe, but ſhe anſwered me with ſmooth language, and promiſed to diſcomfit all their intentions by her bare preſence, and to ſave the innocent Dumont from the hands of our enemies.</p>
               <p>I obſerved ſilence, and ſighed all the way. I hope, my friends, you will look with the eye of pity upon my barbarous conduct towards Arzelia and Alexis, and lay the guilt upon the authors of that infernal plot, who have taken the advantage of my weakneſs. I ſhall, therefore, draw a veil over my conduct at Valence, which I hold in horror and deteſtation.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the count and his ſon had ſuffered ſome delay on their journey; they only reached Valence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, where, to all appearances, they did not find Alexis. Enraged in the idea of my having ſaved their victims, they purſued me in my way to Lyons—my chaiſe is overtaken; Champaign who was behind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed us, and that very inſtant I ſaw myſelf ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſet of horſemen; among others, by the count, his ſon, and an <hi>Exempt of the Police</hi> with a proper eſcort. Traitor, cried I to the chevalier, convinced of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to carry off Dumont, "Coward! what has that
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:030364_0263_0FE5D3D591F7CEC8"/>
poor gentleman done to thee?—Alight, I muſt either have thy life, or thou mine!"</p>
               <p>That inſtant we began a bloody combat, in which I ſee my dear Dumont drop. Champaign, who attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſarm me, is ſlain by my hand, and my brother himſelf ſhares his fate—the cruel chevalier drops down lifeleſs!—The <hi>Exempt</hi> and his followers ruſh upon me; I am bound, hand cuffed, thrown in my chaiſe between miſs d'Anfort, who had fainted, and the count, in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, who loaded me with threats. The dead were taken up in haſte, and thrown in the other chaiſe; but whether from the obſcurity of the night, or from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and conſternation, my poor Dumont was left on the field, the miſtake was diſcovered ſome time after; but, upon returning to the fatal ſpot, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound he had been taken away!</p>
               <p>We proceeded to Paris, where I was thrown into an obſcure priſon, and my trial for the wilful murder of the chevalier d'Anfort was ſoon brought forward. I know not how it would have ended, but that Arzelia, upon receiving the tidings of that fatal cataſtrophe, went and threw herſelf at the king's feet. She gave the monarch an account of our adventures, who was moved, and promiſed to do her juſtice. The count and I actually received orders to appear before his majeſty. Each of us expoſed his own caſe; and that gracious prince, moved to tears, granted me his mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. He would not confine his clemency to this only; as ſovereign, he was moſt graciouſly pleaſed to order my renunciation to be torn, my marriage legalized, Alexis acknowledged, and, if ever I ſhould be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to find him, <hi>Louis</hi> enjoined me to preſent him at court.</p>
               <p>Count d'Anfort alone was unhappy; he was exiled to one of his caſtles, his ſiſter followed him, and we, loaded with royal favors, diſpatched ſeveral faithful emiſſaries in ſearch of Alexis.</p>
               <p>How incenſed was I againſt myſelf for my fatal jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy! That portrait <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

in the convent, was the mere effect of his zeal and del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icacy. Dulys ſaid, if Corſange comes to know that he is father, his paſſion, already too violent, will not keep within the bounds which prudence exacts in ſo cruel a juncture; in conſequence, he made proviſion to have Arzelia delivered of Alexis, at the houſe of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male acquaintance, near the convent, from which he had planned her eſcape, previous to the birth of my ſon. In ſhort, the generous Dulys had done all for me, and I dared to inſult his memory, in accuſing him and my ſpouſe!—Oh! how often have I bluſhed at this crime—how often have I felt the moſt gnawing remorſe!</p>

How the times are changed!—Now, thy father preſſes thee in his arms, thy mother ſmiles on thee, and thou returneſt their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der careſſes! O, my friends! O my Alexis! how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py am I to have been able to bring back thy Clara, thy lovely Clara! Mr. Du Monay who put her under our care, knew nothing of our adventures.—That friend, whom we had known in Paris, before his office of receiver-general of the king's farms, obliged him to fix his reſidence at Marſeilles, knew certainly ſomething of our misfortunes; but we had never made him an entire confidant of the whole; not that he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, but becauſe we wiſhed to keep in our breaſts ſecrets, the very remembrance of which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed us with woe.</p>
               <p>Now come, my Alexis, come to the feet of a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and humane king and ſovereign!—it was he who protected us, it was he who ſaved us from the juſt doom of frowning juſtice—and it is he who will be ſtill thy benefactor and ſupport!—Ah! happy would I be, if the venerable Candor were pleaſed to unite you with his daughter; and would thus unite in happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings whom dire fate has ſo long and cruelly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE marquis de Conſange concluded his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and all his hearers, who were ſingularly moved, began talking in divers ways upon events of ſo extraordinary a nature. Unfortunate father, ſaid the generous Dumont, you have been unjuſt indeed; but how has misfortune ſoured your temper!—The wretch ſuſpects every thing; once deceived, he thinks he always will be. The continual habit of ſorrow irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates his nerves, and renders him paſſionate, hard, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dead to feeling!

                  </gap> Such is my point of view, my principles and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Per lo caro Gieſu,</hi> replies Carlo, that philoſophy is good for nothing. Nothing can bid defiance to the machinations of the wicked: prudence in ſuch caſes frequently draws you into their ſnares: <hi>certamente,</hi> it is wiſer to fly from them entirely, than to avoid them, by watching their motions! You are right, ſaid the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis; better would it have been for me and my ſpouſe to have fled from our tyrants, and to have left a houſe.—You could not, <hi>Signor Corſanjo!</hi> You will pardon me, ſir, I could have done it very early in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Eh, no, <hi>perche,</hi> you was to ſuffer all thoſe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes! it was to be, it was written—predeſtination! Oh, predeſtination breaks in Alexis, are you going to begin your nonſenſe, Sciocco? <hi>Pardonate mi, tenero pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drone:</hi>—have not you yourſelf approved of it? How, purſues the marquis, does Mr. Sciocco think that all that happens to us has been preſcribed? <hi>Si veramente Signor.</hi> Let him run on, father, replies Alexis:—he will ſometimes only talk nonſenſe. His moral dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas are very nonſenſical, my ſon. Upon that footing there would be no criminals, every body would excuſe himſelf by predeſtination!—Heavens! what an error!—have you imbibed thoſe prejudices, my Alexis? No, my father, but I entertained others of a different caſt.
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:030364_0266_0FE5D3EA67E4C4C0"/>
Speak, then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give me an account of your adventures from the time you left the cottage.—You muſt have been concealed in ſome dark corner of the globe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had ſearches made after you throughout the kingdom. I was not concealed, father. Liſten all to me, my dear friends, and you too Clara.—I will ſoon cure you of the unjuſt ſuſpicions you had againſt me, with regard of my connections with the wife of the gaol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of St. Marcellin, and Sophia of Marſeilles.</p>
               <p>Alexis ſatisfied their curioſity, and when he had done ſpeaking, the marquis and marchioneſs embraced him again. They were all ſatisfied, Duverly and Dorance alone obſerved the profoundeſt ſilence.

Dorance had pity on him. Unhappy man, ſaid he, here is thy daughter, durſt thou give her that ſweet name? Yes, I ſhall dare, anſwers Duverly!—Yes, I ſhall give her that precious name; but not before I have avenged thy cauſe! Avenged! Yes: ſoon.</p>

               <p>This ſally of Sciocco excited the laugh in every one of the company: but Carlo was like to be angry; when he remembered that laughing was one of the ſweeteſt pleaſures of man, and ingrafted by nature: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All our heroes were happy; they ſpent ſeveral days in viewing the different departments of the cottage, and afterwards all ſet out together for Paris; the good-natured Candor and his old ſervant, regardleſs of their hoarineſs and infirmities, would be of the party. In conſequence, all the apartments of the cottage are carefully locked, the draw bridge is ſecured, and the journey commenced.</p>
               <p>How pleaſant was this trip! all was buried in oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: neither complaints nor reproaches were heard any more! All countenances were ſerene like all hearts, and the happineſs of ſeeing Alexis preſented to the king, became the general topic.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="unknown:030364_0268_0FE5D3EB2E4886A8"/>
Arrived in Paris, the marquis and his ſon repair im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Verſailles—they arrive before the king! Alexis trembling, dares not look up. Is this your ſon, Corſange? his majeſty aſked. Sire, it is he! He looks very ſhy,—Young man, be good-natured, modeſt, diſcrete, and I will never forſake you! Suppoſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to give him a regiment; what do you think, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, we ſhall ſee how he will manage it! Sire, all the blood in his veins is at your majeſty's ſervice. He ought to imitate the example of his grand-father, who died in my father's ſervice!—He was a brave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. I have known him myſelf, and am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to own, that fighting by his ſide, I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a ſoldier.</p>
               <p>The king ſpoke to them for ſome time longer with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he moſt condeſcending familiarity, and the commiſſion of a colonel being made out, and ſigned for young Corſange, his majeſty diſmiſſed them, loaded with praiſes and benefits.</p>
               <p>A few days after, the young colonel and his Clara ſtept to the altar, and were joined together in holy matrimony! how dear had they purchaſed that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs! Alas, if it muſt be paid with ſo many croſſes can we envy our mortal lot?</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Duverly, always agitated by remorſe, fell dangerouſly ſick, and ſoon expired in the arms of his friends, after having begged a thouſand pardons of Candor, who regretted him ſincerely. On his death-bed he made a will, by which he conſtituted the colonel and his lady, ſole heirs to his conſiderable eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, which he had much improved in America, where he had been reſident fifteen years. He neither forgot to ſettle an annuity upon the good John Picot, whom he bad ſo unjuſtly charged with theft, at the Dolphin inn at Lyons. Signor Carlo had alſo a ſhare of his property, for which he failed not giving thanks to Providence, who had ſo favorably conducted that event.</p>
               <p>Candor, alſo bent under the ſuperior weight of age and infirmity, ſoon after died compoſedly, and without a groan: Alexis cloſed his eyes, and bound himſelf to execute his laſt deſire. The old man had ordered in
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:030364_0269_0FE5D36F2AE2E5A8"/>
his laſt moments, his body to be transferred to the cottage, to repoſe near the aſhes of Adela and his ſon. Therefore, with the permiſſion of the rector, in whoſe pariſh he died, Colonel Corſange, his lady, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and friends proceeded to Grenoble with the remains of their late friend. Upon their arrival, the corpſe was depoſited for a while in a cathedral, till proper preparations could be made in the cottage for its reception.</p>
               <p>On the day following, thirty workmen were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to rebuild the cottage: two wings, and another ſtory were added to it; the windows were made wider, and decorated with balconies. Over the myſterious ſubterranean they built a chapel, which was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the biſhop of Grenoble. The form of the garden was alſo changed, but the rivulet, the little bridge, the grove, and the great poplar tree were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to remain. In ſhort, the young couple left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unimproved. They ſurveyed with pleaſure and emotion the theatre of their loves and adventures. How ſweet is the remembrance of the times when we were happy!—When we ſee places that have been dear to us, the heart dilates, and the ſight wanders to and fro, with a real ſenſation of delight!</p>
               <p>Thus the little rivulet, the bridge, the grove, and poplar tree, were the only objects not altered in the garden; all the remainder was tranſformed into a magnificent park, and the cottage into a ſumptuous and ſplendid caſtle. There was but one room in it, left in its original ſtate. It was the chamber in which Alexis ſlept the firſt night of his reſidence in the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and in which he was ſo much frightened, when he heard the key turn to lock him up, and from here he ſaw, through the window, funeral rites performed by Candor under the great poplar tree. Clara's huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was fond of that room: and ordered his books and muſical inſtrumens to be placed in it.</p>
               <p>When the inſide was completed, the outſide was alſo embelliſhed, the draw bridge was pulled down and a new one conſtructed, the foſſe was bordered with a fine breaſt wall, and before the entry to the caſtle, a fine
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:030364_0270_0FE5D34F9C91DBA8"/>
avenue was opened and prolonged as far as St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellin.</p>
               <p>So diligent were the ſearches made in the foreſt of Chamboran, that within a month's time, the greateſt part of the robbers which infeſted it were apprehended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Several precipices and caverns were filled up with ſtones and earth. Thus this place once ſo gloomy, ſad, and dangerous, became in a little time a real pleaſure-garden.</p>
               <p>When all was completed, ready, and in proper or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the remains of Candor were placed in the chapel, next to thoſe of his unhappy family. The colonel and his lady returned to Paris, leaving the marquis and marchioneſs at <hi>Caſtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The motives of the colonel's return to Paris were ſome regimental concerns: two days after his arrival a man, in a very ſhabby dreſs makes his appearance at his hotel; the porter would drive him away, but the ſtranger inſiſts upon an abſolute neceſſity of ſpeaking to the colonel, and demands immediate admittance. The ſervants, tired of his importunate behavior, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their maſter of his obſtinate requeſt. The ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Alexis runs quickly down ſtairs; trained up in the ſchool of adverſity, could he reject the unfortunate!</p>
               <p>He accoſts the ſtranger. Don't your honor know me? aſks the man. No, my friend; yet I recollect to have ſeen you ſomewhere. Pleaſe your honour, to recollect well. It is uſeleſs, I cannot now. Have not you been brought up at the college of Navarre? Yes: Don't you recollect the beggar you one day took into your apartment to explain to you a watch! Oh lord, is it thee, my good fellow? The very ſame, an' pleaſe your honor: I then foretold you what has happened ſince, and I dare ſay, you remember how I told you, <hi>If you are happy one day, you ſhall ſee me at your door.</hi>

From the public accounts, an' pleaſe your honor; your misfortunes and your father's are known to every body, ſo the report muſt have reached me too. Well, my friend, I am happy, and ſo ſhalt thou be; yes, thou ſhalt be happy too!</p>
               <p>From this moment, Alexis received the poor man in his ſervice, and had never reaſon to repent it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: the man had been a ſoldier, ſome fooliſh trick made him deſert, and he was always ſorry for it. The colonel obtained his pardon, received him in his own regiment, and made him immediately a quarter-maſter.</p>
               <p>Alexis would not confine his generoſity and gratitude to thoſe only who had obliged him: he received alſo Vincent, who had been his man while he was yet at college, among the number of his domeſtics. Even young d'Erreville felt the effects of his beneficence. The reader muſt recollect this fellow ſtudent who introduced Dumont and his pupil to his father, whoſe ſecretary had robbed them in the plains of Belleville. D'Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville had loſt his father. His mother had ſince been married to a giddy young blade, who had ruined her, and, that he and his ſiſter were obliged to live on the fruits of their induſtry. D'Ereville was recommended by Alexis, to an excellent place in the ammunition of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and his ſiſter was married much to her advantage. Alexis ruminated if there was nobody elſe whom he might have ſerved: he forgot nobody, and was cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by all, but eſpecially by his king, who ſoon raiſed him to the moſt exalted ſtation.</p>
               <p>Clara lived happy, and became mother to many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. She was as good a mother, as a tender and faithful ſpouſe.</p>
               <p>The marquis and marchioneſs lived with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the lateſt and happieſt winter of life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dumont, the friend of Alexis, ſuperintended the educatian of his ſons; he had renounced his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt mankind, by the habitual intercourſe with the upright and virtuous.</p>
               <p>As for poor Carlo Sciocco, I am ſorry to inform my readers he went as mad as a march hare, by ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

too much the metaphyſical ſtraights, and being not ſatisfied reſpecting the equilibrium of things, he would even ſcrutinize their nature, and the laws of the equilibrium. There were moments when he fancied all the ſaints in paradiſe before him, to reveal him, the principle of perfect harmony. Alexis, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſorry to ſee him in ſuch a condition, put him under the care of ſome ſubaltern officers, paying them a conſiderable ſum to board and maintain him.</p>
               <p>John Picot was made keeper of Caſtle Corſange, where Alexis and his family ſpent a certain time every ſummer; yet, notwithſtanding its recent ſplendor, and magnificence, Alexis and Clara were better pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with walking in the grove, or along the banks of the rivulet; that happy couple would never forget their former reſidence in this rural ſeat, and would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways call it their <hi>Cottage in the Woods.</hi>
