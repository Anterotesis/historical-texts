            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I SHALL conſider the Words as they lie in the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE <hi>Greatneſs is the Lord's.</hi> And that in a ſingular Manner and tranſcendent Degree. God is infinite in his Being and all adorable Perfections.<hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed; and his Greatneſs is unſearchable,</hi> Pſal. 145.3. The Nations when compar'd with him, are as a Drop of a Bucket, as the ſmall Duſt of the Balance: yea all Nations before him are as Nothing, and they are counted to him leſs than No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and Vanity.<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. 40.15,—17.</note> He is immenſe, and Omnipreſent.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jam. 1.17.</note> And as to thoſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes in which Creatures may reſemble him, they are in God original, eſſential, and without Limits; and ſo are predicated of him in an appropriate Senſe. Agreeably our Lord ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17. <hi>There is none Good but one, that is God.</hi> And, God is ſaid to be <hi>only wiſe.</hi> He is in the Abſtract Goodneſs, Wiſdom, &amp;c.

It is as high as Heaven, what canſt thou do? deeper than Hell, what canſt thou know? The Meaſure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea.</hi> And indeed his Works of Creation, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Redemption, bear clear Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the divine Greatneſs.

            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Power is the Lord's.</hi> Pſalm. 62, 11. <hi>God hath ſpoken once; twice have I heard this, that Power belongeth unto God,</hi> Conſider Power as it may ſignify <hi>Authority:</hi> So it belongs to God, and that in a ſingular Manner. God is the <hi>moſt High,</hi> over all, God bleſſed forever. He is the <hi>high and lofty One,</hi> that dwelleth in the high and holy Place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.15.

and in this Senſe it belongs to God, and that in a ſuperlative Degree, Dan. 4.35. <hi>And all the Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing: And he doth according to his Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth: And none can ſtay his Hand, or ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi> He works all Things after the Counſel of his own Will;<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. 1.11.</note> his Counſel ſhall ſtand, and none can diſannul it; this almighty Being made, upholds and governs the World, by the Word of his Power. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9. <hi>He ſpake, and it was done; he commanded, and it ſtood faſt.</hi> He acts above, yea contrary to the ordinary Courſe of Nature, in Miracles.

is ſtronger than that ſtrong One, and ſpoils him of his Goods. He gave his Apoſtles <hi>Power over Devils, Luke</hi> 9.1. And when he pleaſeth, he converts Sinners according to the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power: Turns them from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God. And he makes uſe of frail Men as Inſtruments in this great Work, that the Excellency of the Power may appear to be of God. And then God maintains the Work of his Grace in them againſt all Oppoſition from Earth and Hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation.</hi> In a Word, God is Omnipotent, and there is no Strength can prevail againſt him. With God all Things are poſſible, nothing hard or difficult. And this Power is never exhauſted, or in the leaſt diminiſh'd. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.28, 29. <hi>Haſt thou not known? Haſt thou not heard, that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the Ends of the Earth fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no ſearching of his Underſtanding. He giveth Power to the faint; and to them that have no Might, he increaſeth Strength.</hi> O let us then ſubmit to his Will in all

Accordingly, we have an Account of great Sums of Money already found, from which our Forces, under the General Lord ALBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MARLE, and Admiral POCOCKE, we hope will reap a rich Reward of their great Toils and Valour.
