            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Occaſion of the following Diſcourſes, of which the firſt is but a Preparative to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, was the Removal of a certain Perſon by Death, ſome ſmall Space of Time after the Laſt ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Solemnity, which has been the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter of much Diſcourſe, and the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of many Reflections.</p>
                  <p>I thought it was my Duty to improve that ſolemn Providence publickly, for the Edification and Vindication of ſuch as are truly pious, and for the Conviction of the Impenitent: This therefore I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in the Sermons following, which by the Advice of Friends are now ſubmitted to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040085_0003_101627E65EF66FF8"/>the Readers Judgment, with this Requeſt, that he would not condemn them, either in the Whole or in Part, before he weighs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially what is offered in them, by the Sanctuary Scales.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the awful Providence of God, reſpecting the aforeſaid Perſon, gave Birth to the ſubſequent Diſcourſes, I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not improper to preface them, with ſome brief Account of his Character, as alſo of the Manner of his being taken, and of his Diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>By the beſt Information I can get of his Neighbours, he had a very regular and Chriſtian like Converſation.</p>
                  <p>And when examined here, the <hi>Saturday</hi> before the Sacrament, he gave a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and ſatisfactory Relation of his gracious Experiences.</p>
                  <p>The Time and Manner of his being taken was as follows: Upon the Sabbath Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the Houſe of a certain Perſon near this Place, after the reading of a Chapter of ſacred Scripture, he was ſtruck with ſuch a Senſe of the Holineſs of GOD, as overwhelmed his Spirits, ſo that he fainted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040085_0004_101627E9F9C7C750"/>and fell to the Earth; after which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil beſet him with violent Temptations, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>That he was a Hypocrite, and as bad as</hi> Spira; the Shock of which his feeble Faith not being able to endure, he was imediately bereaved of the Exerciſe of his Reaſon, and then knew not what he ſpoke or acted. This was the Account he gave himſelf the <hi>Monday</hi> following, in the Afternoon, when he enjoyed (ſo far as I and others were capable of judging) the full Exerciſe of his Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſtoried about (as I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) that it was the Preaching of one or more Miniſters, which was the Cauſe of his Diſorder; But there is not the leaſt Shadow of Reaſon for this Aſperſion, his own Relations have acknowledged, <hi>That during the whole of his Illneſs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon none, as being the Cauſes of it.</hi> Surely if there had been any Thing in this, he would have made ſome Mention of it that Afternoon aforeſaid, when the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of his Diſtreſs were enquired into; but not one Word Was ſo much as hinted this Way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:040085_0005_101627EE13E6E8E0"/>
The Manner of his Death (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Perſon of Credit that was then preſent) Was hopeful; he ſeemed to enjoy, for ſome Space before his Diſſolution, the Exerciſe of his Reaſon, during which he penitently aſked Forgiveneſs of his Father, reſpecting the Faults he had committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ſo expired.</p>
                  <p>His Relations concur in aſſerting, that he eat but very little for ſome Days before he was taken (ſo as is before hinted) viz. nothing but a ſmall Cruſt of Bread and Water, Which with his Riding about Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles, for ſome Days ſucceſſively (his Place of Abode being about Fifteen Miles from the Meeting) it is probable Weakened his Conſtitution conſiderably, and ſo prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fuel for the Temptations of the Enemy to faſten with more Power upon him; this he himſelf complained of on the aforeſaid <hi>Munday,</hi> and therewith uſed the Pſalmiſt's Petition, <hi>Pſ. li. 8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Candid Reader, give me Leave to add one Word more, and I ſhall conclude; I pray God that thou and I may be aſſiſted of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040085_0006_101627EF9EF78168"/>him to learn ſuitable Inſtructions from, and take ſeaſonable Warning, by ſuch awful Examples, leſt We our ſelves be made ſuch.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Good both Moral and Phyſical is the proper Object of the Will or rational Apetite, ſo Truth is the proper Object and Food of the Mind. But it is mournful to behold the awful Infatuation and Diſorder, which have now ſeized all the noble Powers of rational, once
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040085_0008_101627F4C43777C0"/>innocent, but now degenerate Creatures! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, how imperiouſly do their Wills tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over their enſlaved Minds! How eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do they court real Evil under the Guiſe of Good, and greedily embrace temporary and periſhing for durable and eternal Gain! And thus like the Dog in the Fable, while they graſp at fleeting Shadows, they loſe the enduring Subſtance! But the fatal Original of this Folly and Diſorder, is owing to the Defects, Darkneſs and Infatuation of the <hi>Mind;</hi> which not only through the corrupt Byaſs of the <hi>Will,</hi> but alſo becauſe of its own native Weakneſs and Ignorance, is eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by the ſophiſtical Arts of Satan and his Emiſaries, to aſſent to Error and Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, under the Pretext of Truth. Dreadful Inſtances of this we have in our Text and Context, in which is contained a Deſcription of the <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> and his deceived <hi>Followers;</hi> as alſo of their deſerved Ruin and final Overthrow. Some of which I ſhall mention. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is called <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>That Man of Sin;</hi> which ſeems to ſignify, that he is not only notoriouſly wicked himſelf, but commands and commends Impiety in others. And do not the <hi>Popes of Rome</hi> command the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints and Angels? Have they not contrived, enjoyned and praiſed the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040085_0009_101627F6ED7FCFD8"/>Murder of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of all Orders? And do they not connive at the moſt execrable Uncleanneſs to advance their worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another <hi>Character</hi> is this, <hi>That he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God or that is worſhiped. v.</hi> 4. Have not <hi>Popes</hi> had the Impudence not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, with the greateſt Degrees of Diſdain <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors,</hi> who are called Gods, becauſe they are his Vicegerents, in Reſpect of civil Power and Authority, and thereby are dark Shadows and faint Repreſentatives of his Glorious Sovereignty, but even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Authority of God himſelf, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanding and caſhiering his poſitive Laws and Inſtitutions, and even tearing one of the Commandments out of the Decalogue?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third <hi>Character</hi> is, <hi>That he as God ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. v.</hi> 4. As God is worſhiped in the Aſſemblies of his People, is not the <hi>Pope</hi> ſo worſhiped in the <hi>Papiſt's</hi> Churches? Do they not ſtile him <hi>our Lord God the Pope,</hi> in their blaſphemous <hi>Miſſals?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth <hi>Character</hi> is, <hi>That he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in a Myſtery of Iniquity. v.</hi> 7. <hi>i. e.</hi> Wickedneſs cloaked with a fair Pretext of Piety. And will not the <hi>Pope</hi> and his bloody blind Votaries pretend a great Deal of Zeal &amp;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:040085_0010_101627F879114890"/>and Devotion, when they are going to cut your Throats, or pick your Pockets.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth <hi>Character</hi> is, <hi>That his coming is after the Working of Satan, with all Power and Signs and lying Wonders, and with all Deceiveableneſs of Unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh. v.</hi> 10. It is too notorious to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that <hi>Popes</hi> and their Adherents have almoſt in every Age, ſince their Antichriſtian Kingdom has been erected, pretended a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to work Wonders and Miracles; but their Wonders are lying Ones, moſtly wretched Untruths, or jugling Tricks, and fraudulent Impoſitions upon the poor ignorant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded People; or if there was any Reality in any of them, it was through the Working of <hi>Satan. Others may call them pious Frauds</hi> (ſays <hi>Henry) but the Apoſtle called them Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and Wicked Frauds; and indeed all Fraud which is contrary to Truth, is an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thing;</hi> as the ſame Author obſerves.</p>
                  <p>After the Apoſtle had ſpoken thus much, concerning the <hi>Characters of Antichriſt,</hi> he comes to deſcribe the <hi>Properties</hi> of his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> one of which is mentioned in the Words I am now to inſiſt upon, and it is this, <hi>That they receive not the Love of the Truth that they might be ſaved.</hi> This, in order to vindicate God's Juſtice and Holineſs, in his penal Proceſs againſt them, is repreſented to

To ſhew how heinous this Sin of not <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Love of the Truth</hi> is in it ſelf, and how offenſive to God, as well as deſtructive to us. And (2.) to ſignify the Stupidity of Sinners who need ſuch repeated Warnings, in order to fix neceſſary Impreſſions of their Guilt and Danger becauſe of Sin upon them.</p>
                  <p>Two Words only of the Text under our preſent Conſideration, <hi>viz.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Metaphiſical Truth</hi> is, when the Form or Appearance of a Thing anſwers what it repreſents.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Logical Truth</hi> conſiſts in our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Thing according to its Nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Ethical Truth</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>Conformity</hi> of our outward <hi>Expeſſions</hi> to our inward <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,</hi> or in the Harmony and Agreement of the Speeches of our Lips with the Dictates

2. The Goſpel is called <hi>Truth,</hi> becauſe of the Simplicity and Candour of its Doctrines, which give a juſt Repreſentation of Things, according to their different Natures and final Iſſues. Sin is there repreſented in its native Horrors, and Holineſs in its proper Charms and alluring Attractives, and the Fruits of both ſet in a true Light. Its Hiſtories are an honeſt and true Relation of Matters of Fact, as the Simplicity of the Style, and conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Harmony of its different Narratives wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Its <hi>Precepts</hi> are a juſt and true Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Claims of Right, which God and our Neighbour have to our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Service: A tranſcript of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and agreeable to the moral Perfections, of that Glorious Being to whom they owe their Original.</p>
                  <p>Its <hi>Promiſes</hi> are not like the fabulous <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiums</hi> of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Poets, (tho' natural Men treat them as if they were no better) but True and Faithful. Deut. VII. 9.10. <hi>Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth Govenant and Mercy with them that love him, and keep his Commandments to a Thouſand Generations; and repayeth them that hate him to their Face to deſtroy them, he will not be ſlack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his Face.</hi>
                  </p>

Its <hi>Threats</hi> are no Romances or Bugbears, but ſuch deſerved Penaltys, ſuited to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Aggravations of Crimes, (whatever ſecure Sinners dream to the contrary) as that God who is Juſtice and Truth it ſelf will ſurely inflict, <hi>the Heavens and Earth may paſs away, but not one Word that ever God has ſpoken, ſhall paſs away without its juſt Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment,</hi> one <hi>Jot</hi> or <hi>Tittle</hi> of his Truths ſhall never fail, <hi>Mat.</hi> V. 18.</p>
                  <p>Its <hi>Terms</hi> are no flattering Impoſitions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Diſciples credulity, like the Turkiſh Tales, but a genuine and true Relation of the worſt they muſt ſuffer for his Sake.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Arabian</hi> Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> firſt divulged his religious Hypotheſis at <hi>Mecha,</hi> he ſuited his Principles to corrupt nature's Dictates, and ſiniſter Inclinations, and made theſe Things the great incentive to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them; which were moſt ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to human Paſſions, and moſt ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to Temporal Intereſts: He promiſed a carnal Paradiſe after Death and Honours Profits, and Preferments in Life, as the grand Motives to engage the rude Populace to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to his erroneous Opinions, he indulged the carnal and cruel Appetites, with the unreaſonable liberty of abhorred Polygamy, and the moſt Savage Barbarity: By which art full Device, attended with the Terror of

But our Glorious <hi>JESUS</hi> not intending a Kingdom in this World took not ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to erect it, as were hatched in the Womb of carnal Wiſdom. Nay, on the contrary the Terms our Lord propoſed were ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the corrupt Inclinations of Nature, ſo croſs to Men's Honour and Intereſts, that they ſeem'd to have a Natural and ſtrong Tendency to drive the whole World away from him, inſtead of gaining any to him, our Lord propos'd no temporal Paradiſe to his Diſciples here, nor a carnal One here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; but on the contrary informed them that they muſt expect a continu'd Scene of Affliction and Sorrow in this World. <hi>Joh.</hi> XVI 33. <hi>Acts</hi> XIV. 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> XVI. 20, As alſo, that they muſt deny their Luſts, Wills, Honours and temporary Intereſts, and that on the Account of a Spiritual and (at preſent) inviſible Glory and Happineſs, to be enjoy'd in the next State. <hi>Luke.</hi> IX. 23.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:040085_0016_10162808C5902220"/>This duly conſidered, together with the ſpeedy and vaſt Progreſs, the Goſpel made in the early Ages of Chriſtianity among the politeſt Nations, and that without the Helps of civil Power, or human Literature, yea, againſt the utmoſt Force, of both, ſhews with meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Brightneſs the divine Birth of that Goſpel we proſeſs, whoſe holy Laws and equal Terms are ſo contrary to the corrupt Luſts and natural Inclinations of Mankind, that unleſs they had been accompanied with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Energy, none would (in the Face of ſuch Danger as the primitive Chriſtians were expoſed to) have complied with them, and ſo the Chriſtian Name would have been long ago extinct, and therefore none now in being to profeſs the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> What! to give up and entirely abandon all theſe Luſts and Intereſts, which we naturally love above our Lives, yea, our Souls, and expoſe our ſelves to a Series of Shame, Pain and Suffering, and all for the Promiſes of a future and unſeen World!

That his <hi>People were deſtroyed for lack of Knowledge:</hi> And, alaſs, there is too great Reaſon for the ſame Complaint at this Day over a great Part of this miſerable Land! who not being by Catechiſing inſtructed in the firſt Truths of the Chriſtian Religion in their early Years, are ſuffered to wander endleſsly in the wild Mazes of thoſe ſmoth deceitful Doctrines their Corrupt Natures dictates, and ſo are ignorant of, and averſe to, the plain fundamental Truths of that Religion they profeſs, and therefore paſs a Judgment upon what they hear, rather according to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Byaſs of their Fancy and Caprice, than the Rules of Scripture and Reaſon. And thus truly the Praiſe or Diſpraiſe of the moſt are equally inſignificant and trifling; for they can give as little Reaſon for the one as the other: But becauſe it is the Faſhion, they muſt paſs their Verdict forſooth, and that is but a random Shot directed rather by their Palate than their Judgment or Reaſon. This lamentable Ignorance is the great Cauſe why ſo many get ſo little Good by what they hear, as our Lord informs us in his Explication of

                  <p>Another Argument confirming the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a divine Providence, may be drawn from the Order and Harmony, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually preſerved, both in the natural and moral Creation.</p>
                  <p>It's ſurprizing to behold, how all the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Creatures in the ſpacious Univerſe, are exactly fitted in their Form and Texture, to anſwer the various Uſes for which they are deſign'd! And that notwithſtanding the contrary qualities of which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; they ſhould conſpire to maintain a general and ſteady Concord!

And ſo neceſſary is the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the aforeſaid Union; that without it the Frame of univerſal Nature would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſolve, and crumble into it's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chaos and Confuſion. He that duly
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:040085_0071_10162890EED25018"/>conſiders thoſe Things, will be obliged to confeſs, that <hi>non caeco impetu volvuntur Rotae. i. e.</hi> That the Wheels of Providence are not rowl'd by blind Chance. For that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe or croſs Motions of unthinking Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould conduce to attain one uniform end and that worthy of the wiſeſt Agent; muſt needs be aſcribed to an infinite Mind, who ſits at the Helm of Government, fixes the Springs, and guides the Wheels of Motion.</p>
                  <p>And if we conſider Mankind, either in their private, civil, or religious Capacities; the reality and Neceſſity of a ſuperintending Providence, will appear conſpicuous.</p>

And what reaſon can be aſſigned for many Duties of Religion, if we believe not, that God has the ſupream diſpoſal of all Events. How can we rationally truſt in him in the midſt of Danger for Protection, Pray to him in want for ſupply, or Praiſe him for Mercies already vouchſafed? — But not to inſiſt,</p>
                  <p>As Man in his <hi>Creation,</hi> was the <hi>Crown</hi> of all the viſible Works of God. So in his <hi>Preſervation</hi> and Government, he is the ſpecial Object of God's providential <hi>Care.</hi> But when theſe once favourite Creatures continue to violate their Creators Laws; and obſtinately to reject the repeated offers of his Love; it pleaſes the juſt <hi>Jehovah</hi> by his righteous Providence, to make them (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) terrible Inſtances of his awful ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; in leaving them to a judicial Blindneſs and obduration here, as a preparative for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Damnation hereafter. This we have repreſented in the ſtrongeſt Terms, and moſt dreadful Colours, in the Text, which is the ſubject of our preſent Meditations. In which we may note two Things, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3.

Satan the Father of Lies</hi> and Falſhood. <hi>John VIII</hi> 44. Or the deceitful Heart of Man. <hi>Jer. XVII.</hi> 9.

XIV</hi> 12. And by tempting their <hi>Ambition,</hi> to think otherwiſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then in Truth they are. <hi>Gal.

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:040085_0075_10162896D2148658"/>ſee, ſhould be made blind: That ſuch who ſhun the Light, ſhould be puniſhed with darkneſs; and that as a judicial preparative for eternal Damnation. Which is,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The natural Iſſue, and fearful Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former Providences, as our Text expreſſes in the cleareſt Manner, <hi>that they all might be damned.</hi>— Here the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, certainty, and judicial deſign of their Damnation is mentioned.

                  <p>But to make this awful Truth more plain, I ſhall further endeavour to ſhew what is <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> by God's <hi>ſending ſtrong Deluſion;</hi> and what is <hi>implyed</hi> in it. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>(1) That there is an abſolute neceſſity of a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> to atone for the Creatures offences; which is evident, (1.) From the infinite

                     <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin, conſidered objectively, (2.)

And this (3.) Every Creature is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly uncapable to perform, being both <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>imperfect.</hi> That there ſhould be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Proportion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>in degree, between the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed, and the Satisfaction paid; is ſo evident from the Principles of natural Reaſon, and diſtributive Juſtice? that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing need be ſaid in Confirmation of it, to ſuch as are not willfully blind. Now Sin being committed againſt an infinite Majeſty, neceſſarily contracts an infinite guilt; which how is it Poſſible for any <hi>finite Creature</hi> to make full Satisfaction for? Surely, <hi>ultra poſſe, non datur eſſe;</hi> the effect can not exceed its cauſe. Again let it be conſidered that every Creature is imperfect, which their practiſe but too evidently proves: And therefore cannot for the Reaſon aforeſaid, perfectly obey a righteous Law; which is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding required on pain of Death. <hi>Gal.

Thus our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obedience being due to God, as our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, Preſerver, and Benefactor, cannot be a Compenſation for our paſt diſobedience: For the Payment of one Debt, which is Natural, will make no Satiſfaction for another which is contracted. But then. (2.) Another foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental <hi>Truth</hi> is this That the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſuitably qualified by his active and paſſive Obedience, to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the Demands of the Law, and divine Juſtice; and thereby to bring in an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs, and that Salvation is in no other. <hi>Dan.</hi> IX. 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> V. 9. <hi>Joh.</hi> XI. 25. <hi>Act.</hi> IV, 12. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> II. 22. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> IV. 2.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> III. 16.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> X, 14.</p>

Tho' the Truth is in many Places they are like to meet with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in the latter, after all the Pains they can take to humour and pleaſe a carnal People; and for my own Part I cannot but wonder that carnal Men who are well in their witts, ſhould thruſt themſelves into the Miniſtry when there is no Proſpect of Gain by it, either in this or the next World?

                  <p n="1">1. When <hi>Attending</hi> upon (but unworthily) <hi>the Ordinances of his Worſhip,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. XI.</hi> 30. <hi>For this Cauſe many are weak, and ſickly among you; and many ſleep.</hi> (i. e.)

<pb n="128" facs="unknown:040085_0123_1016291750FB59E0"/>of the Death of the righteous; wherein it is frequently (becauſe of its pleaſantneſs the Sting of Death being removed) compared to Sleep, <hi>Theſ.</hi> IV. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. 20, 51. You may note three Things worthy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, in that forecited Place of Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor. XI.</hi> 30, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) That not a few but many of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> were ſickly after their unworthy Participation of the Lords Supper. and (2,) That not a few but many were actually removed by Death, upon the aforeſaid Account. and (3) That thoſe very Perſons, ſo puniſhed, were truly Pious, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>But when we are judged, we are Chaſtned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the World.</hi> Thus you ſee it is no new Thing (Whatever ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imagine) for not only one but many Perſons to be ſuddenly removed by Death, after Sacramental Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>That is an awful Inſtance of <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who were ſlain by Fire in the very Act of Worſhip; for offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>ſtrange Fire, which the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them not.

                     <q>That it is a dangerour Thing in the Service of God to decline from his own Inſtitutions; we have to do with a God who is wiſe to preſcribe his own Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, juſt to require what he has preſcribed, and powerful to revenge what he has not preſcribed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Memorable likewiſe is that Inſtance of <hi>Uzziah</hi> a religious Prince, who for invading the Prieſts Office in burning incenſe, (which ſprung from his Pride whatever pious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences he might have to palliate it) was ſtruck in the very Act of his Worſhip with Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which continued with him to his Death, 2. <hi>Chron.

                  <p n="2">2.

<note n="(s)" place="bottom">Vide Pol. in Loc.</note> thus did this pious Man's Sun ſet under a Cloud; thus was the folly and wickedneſs of thoſe Sons of his, whom he had indulged his Ruin at laſt.

He therefore often ſuffers them to enjoy an unſullied Character, and the wicked World becauſe they are of the ſame ſtamp, Father and Family with themſelves, only a little better Poliſh'd, like them very well; and cry them up for fine Men, very fine Men to be ſure; while in the mean Time they are nothing but bloody Cut-throats, and ſneaking hirelings: <hi>ſee</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> XVIII. 5, 7. — <hi>Joh.</hi> XV. 19.</p>

                  <p>Now Brethren is not this a dark gloomy and ſtumbling Providence?

                  <p>More <hi>generally</hi> the Deſign of ſuch dark Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences is to vindicate the divine Soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity over all, to magnify the Riches of his pure Grace upon ſome, and his ſtrict Juſtice towards others, according to his invariable and eternal Purpoſes; of which Providence is but the Executor. 1. <hi>Pet.

                  <p>More <hi>particularly</hi> as to good People the Intentions of the aforeſaid Providences, ſeem to be theſe following, namly</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>excite</hi> their <hi>fear,</hi> becauſe of God's Holineſs and their own meanneſs, that they may <hi>enter into the Rock, and hide them in the Duſt, for ſear of the Lord, and for the Glory of his Majeſty.</hi> It is in this Reſpect the Pſalmiſt crys out, <hi>Pſ. CXIX.</hi> 120<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>My Fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> As alſo that they may be made awfully Senſible of the Solemnity of his ſacred Ordinances, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, and ſo inclin'd to ſpeak in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> and <hi>Jacob's</hi> Language; mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> XVIII. 27.30. and <hi>Gen.</hi> XXVIII. 17. It was doubtleſs to vindicate the divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from a ſordid Contempt, and prophane irreverence, that the thouſands of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:040085_0134_101629320C4B9928"/>ſtruck with a ſolemn dread, by the Death of <hi>Uzzah.</hi> And no doubt this was the Cauſe why ſo many of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church were ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with ſickneſs and ſwallow'd up of Death, immediately after the Sacramental Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>excite</hi> their <hi>Faith,</hi> dark Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces give room for the Exerciſe of that noble Grace, which it is our Honour, our Duty, and our Intereſt to live by. <hi>Heb. X.</hi> 38. This inclines a gracious Perſon with <hi>Abraham</hi> not to ſtagger at the promiſe, but to <hi>Hope againſt Hope,</hi> (i. e. againſt human probability or the preſent Aſpect or Courſe of Things) upon that ſtable and faithful Foundation the Word of God. <hi>Rom. IV.</hi> 18, 20. <hi>Heb. X.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Alſo with <hi>Moſes</hi> in the midſt of danger, when no Way opens for eſcape, to wait patiently for the Salvation of God. <hi>Ex. XIV.</hi> 13.</p>

III.</hi> 17, 18. The Exerciſe of this noble Grace of Faith was no doubt the great deſign of that trying Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Abraham,</hi> reſpecting his ſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould ſlay him who was the Son of the Promiſe, his only Son, the Son of his eager Deſires and blooming Hopes, the Staff of his
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:040085_0135_10162935FA50C988"/>aged Years, and thereby at once break the Laws of Nature and of God, expoſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Reproach of Heathens, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the continual revilings and abhorrence of the Wife of his Boſom. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe ſurprizing Difficulties, he diſputed not the divine Precept, queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not the divine Promiſe, but obey's! See dear Brethren how conſpicuouſly divine Wiſdom ſhines in bringing to paſs this dark and trying Providence, the iſſue of which tends ſo much to illuſtrate the Honours of the divine Goodneſs and faithfullneſs, and to render perpetually apparent the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Strength, and tranſcendent Beauty of his Servants Faith, and Obedience; which ſo well deſerves our higheſt Admiration, and ſo juſtly demands our laborious Imitation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Deſign of thoſe dark Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, is to try the Love of Gods People, the Lord Jeſus ſpeaks to his People, by them, as he did to <hi>Peter, Joh. XXI.</hi> 15. <hi>Simon Son of Jonas, loveſt thou me more then theſe,</hi> (i. e.) do you Love me more then all your Friends and dear Relations?

                  <p n="4">4. Another end of thoſe ſtumbling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, is to <hi>excite deſire</hi> in God's People after Heaven, if they enjoyed a continued Scene of Honour, Eaſe and Proſperity in this World, it is probable they would be too thoughtleſs of the next; too little affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Glories of it, either in longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, or in a delightſome expectation of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying them But when thoſe Lillies find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perpetually environ'd with piercing Thorns, attended with a Train of ſucceſſive Diſaſters, that oftentimes like <hi>Noa's</hi> Dove upon the watry World, they cannot find a reſting Place; for <hi>without are fightings, and within are fears.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.

This makes the Thoughts of a reſt above ſweet to their oppreſſed Hearts, as the Expectation of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> was to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> wearied in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts Labrinths; or as the Hopes of a calm Harbour is pleaſant to the perplexed Mariner, where he may find a ſafe Sanctuary from the bluſtring Winds, a ſecure retreat from the enraged Deeps.</p>
                  <p>This makes them groan within themſelves <hi>waiting for the Redemption of their Bodies</hi> Rom. <hi>VIII.</hi> 23.</p>

5. Another Deſign of ſuch dark Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences is doubtleſs to excite the People of God to <hi>earneſt Labour</hi> in order to know ſo much of the Mind of God in them, as is neceſſary to direct them how to behave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; and to perform the Duties of the preſent Time and Day; which is beſt attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by comparing the Rod with the Word. <hi>Mic.

                  <p n="6">6. To excite Gods People to, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them in, the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Patience, Rom.

For they preached much Terror to whom it belonged, the Speeches of Chriſt to the Phariſees were big with Terror, and even the Scriptures themſelves muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for this Reaſon; for they are full of Terror againſt wicked People.

But here you need not expect a particular Deſcription of the damned State for that (in full) the miſerable Subjects of it can only give, from their own wofull Experience.</p>
                  <p>The beginning or firſt Fruits of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which impenitent Sinners feel in this Life, are awfull; for all of them are in a State of Sin, Death, Wrath, Ignominy, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Extreme Miſery. <hi>Rom VII.</hi> 5. <hi>Epheſ.

After the Soleninity of the judicial Proceſs is over, and the final Sentence paſſed; away the wicked Muſt pack to their curſed <hi>Tophet,</hi> to feel the Completion of it.

Which I come now to give ſome brief Account of in reſpect of their <hi>Nature, Degree, and Duration.</hi>
                  </p>

1. The Nature of the damned's Torments, appears in two Things, <hi>viz.</hi> Their privative and poſſitive Miſeries, or in the evils of loſs and Senſe they are expoſed to, thus the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of the damned are generally, and I think juſtly deſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>privative miſeries</hi> of the <hi>Damned</hi> are principaly theſe following, namely they ſhall be perfectly and eternally ſeperated from all Union to, Communion with, and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bleſſed God; who is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the firſt Truth and Supreme Good, the great ſource and Spring of Happineſs; <hi>whoſe Favour is better then Life,</hi> and whoſe Frowns are worſe then Death. And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence bereaved of thoſe holy Qualities, and delightful Enjoyments which are the proper and natural Iſſues of his gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; as well as perpetually Baniſhed from the Seat of his glorious Reſidence, where thoſe are exerted and poſſeſſed in the Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Beauty and Delight; and finaly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from that Bliſsful Fellowſhip and ſocial Worſhip, with Saints and Angels, which are equally the Ornament and Entertainment of the Courts above.</p>
                  <p>In this Liſe the wicked for the moſt Part, are not ſenſible how vaſt the Loſs of a God is; their Minds are ſo miſerably darkned by Sin, that they have no ſuitable Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:040085_0166_1016298189E324A8"/>of his Glory and greatneſs; infinite Excellency and tranſcendent allſufficiency. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> II. 14.</p>
                  <p>Again they are ſtrangely diverted, from contemplating upon the divine Perfections, by the Amuſements of worldly Buſineſs and ſenſitive Pleaſure; to which they have a ſtrong Byaſs, and Inclination of will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. <hi>Rom.</hi> VIII. 5. <hi>For they that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, do mind the Things of the Fleſh:</hi> Natural Men are ſo fleſhly, ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into Beaſts; that they purſue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally as their chief good (notwithſtanding their falſe Pretenſes to the contrary) thoſe Gratifications that are common to them; thay have ſo far extinguiſhed the ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the divine Image, and forgot the Dignity of the human Nature, that they eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſue the ſame Deſign of Life with Brutes, and the chief Difference between them (in this reſpect) is that they are more artful and miſchievous then they, in the proſecution of it. They greedily endeavour to glut their fleſhly Souls with carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and when diſappointed in one Object they run to another with impatient haſte, and thus they ſpend their wretched Lives in fruitleſs Labours and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>Rom.</hi> VI. 27. And by this hurrie are kept from the neceſſary Knowledge of;
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:040085_0167_101629841EA4E8E0"/>and ſuitable Meditation upon the ſupreme Being.</p>
                  <p>But the Damned will have a confounding Senſe of the Loſs of a God in Eternity, when their Minds being freed from their preſent Diverſions, Amuſements, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, ſhall be experimentally and judicially enlarged, to Frame a juſter Eſtimate of the divine Goodneſs, and Excellency both Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and communicative; and conſequently inclined to dwell for ever upon the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts of their being ſeperated eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly from them. The bleſſed God being the fountain of all deſirable Good both Moral and Phiſical, the Soul that is ſeperated from him can have no more ſolid Delight and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, ſuited to its noble Nature and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of its exalted Deſires; then the Body of animal Life when ſeperated from the Soul.</p>
                  <p>And are not natural Men in general as ſtupidly and inſenſible of the other Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before hinted? They have no <hi>Piſga's</hi> proſpect (by faith) of the celeſtial Canaan nor any taſte or reliſh (being carnal) of thoſe pious pleaſures which are the natural Reſult of the divine Life. And do they not ſecretly diſlike the Converſation of the Saints, becauſe of their ſtrict Holineſs, pious and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſes, which ſometimes gripe their guilty Conſciences; and therefore they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:040085_0168_101629866470A0E8"/>ſhun them when moſt Zealous, leaſt their carnal eaſe ſhould be broken and their falſe Hopes unhinged? And are not their Houſes inſtead of Being <hi>Bethels</hi> wherein Gods Name is worſhipped, rather <hi>Bethavens</hi> wherein it is prophan'd? But in Eternity the Tables will be turned, they ſhall ſee ſuch Dawnings of Glory and joyous Triumph, in the ſhining Appearance of the Saints and Angels; as will much heighten their Eſteem of the Beauty, Splendor, and Delights of that Paradiſe, which is made the Seat of their perpetual Reſidence; and from which them ſelves are forever Excluded; this will ſtrike their ſofteſt Paſſions, and extort their never ending Lamentations! <hi>ſee Luk.</hi> XIII. 28. <hi>There ſhall be Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth</hi> (ſays the bleſſed Jeſus) <hi>When ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Jſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And tho' their Love to the Saints, will be much the ſame then that it is now, <hi>viz.</hi> The Perfection of that hatred; yet for the ſake of their own ſafey they will be deſirous to croud in among them whom they now ſo much diſdain, but to no purpoſe, the Door is ſhut, the Gulph is fix'd, they ſhall not find acceſs, <hi>Luk. XIII.</hi> 25. — 27. <hi>Luk. XVI.</hi> 26. And to conclude this Head, is it not juſt that thoſe
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:040085_0169_10162989B5EFE068"/>who would not worſhip God here ſhould be be deprived of the Opportunity of it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after? You filthy Sinners, who are not afraid or aſhamed to out do both Pagans and Devils, in rending the venerable Name of God by your horrid Oaths, and Blaſphemy's, know to your Terror, that you will have enough of this wretched Work to do in Hell, which you have accuſtomed your ſelves too much to on Earth, among the damned Ghoſts and Damned Angels throughout Eternity.</p>

When you ſee the Hand of God upon ſome Profeſſors of Religion, afflicting them with Diſpair, Madneſs, or Death it ſelf, then let your Fleſh tremble for fear of GOD, and be afraid of his Judgements, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the righteous God hath not hitherto blaſted your rational Powers, and utterly bereaved you of that Reaſon, which you have ſo long abuſed, to the Diſhonour of its kind Author, and the unſpeakable Diſadvantage of its indolent Poſſeſſor. You may alſo admire, unhappy Sinners, the ſparing Mercies of a provoked yet patient God, that he has not ſunk you with <hi>Cain, Judas</hi> and <hi>Spira</hi> in the Gulf of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, who have for ſo long a Tract of Time been laying up ſo much <hi>Fuel</hi> for it, by ſinning againſt a gracious God. Admire, Sinner, that the Breath of that Life which has been ſo long employed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting the great Deſign of it, has not been blown out long agoe in obſcure Darkneſs. — Might not the juſt God have cauſed the Earth to open beneath thy Feet, and ſwallow thee in Death, in the Midſt of thy Luſts, as he did to <hi>Coran</hi> and his Companions? Has the Devil had ſuch Power over the Bedies of pious People for a Time, as has been proved? Then admire, wicked Sinner, that he has not hitherto torn thee in Pieces, or that he doth not even this Moment Sieze thee, and drag thee quick to Hell! — What Fence haſt thou to guard thee from his cruel Gripe? None at all, unhappy Creature! but thy falſe Hope! and that is not worth a Ruſh! You'll ſay, that God is ſtronger than the Devil; that is true indeed; but ſo much the more terrible is your Caſe, who have him for your Enemy O, but you truſt in him for Protection; anſwer, it is Falſe! it is falſe! if you had true Faith in God the Temper of your Hearts

But Sinner beware you perſiſt no longer in thoſe Paths of Death you have ſo long trod, otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect terrible Judgments ſuch as our Text mentions, which may be juſtly to you as the Hand writing on the Wall was to <hi>Belſhazer.</hi> — I conclude with that memorable and ſolemn Saying of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> IV. 17. <hi>For the Time is come that Judgment muſt begin at the Houſe of God, and if it firſt begin at us, what ſhall the End be of them, who obey not the Goſpel of GOD.</hi>
