            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE ſubject of finance ſeems to be ſo little underſtood in America, that we find almoſt as many opinions as there are men who undertake to reaſon upon it ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematically, eſpecially upon the large ſcale upon which it ſeems neceſſary now to take it up. But it is a ſubject in which we are all deeply intereſted, and our affairs, though in other reſpects they are in as proſperous a condition as we could have expected, have run ſo extremely wild in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that every one perceives we have ſtrayed from the proper road, and ſeems anxiouſly inquiſitive how to recover it again.</p>
            <p>The rapacious violence of the Britiſh Court threw us ſuddenly into one of the moſt deſperate ſituations imaginable. On the one hand we ſaw nothing but the moſt abject ſlavery, from which the minds of a people accuſtomed to think themſelves free, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, if they had no other aſylum than death: On the the other, a mazy wilderneſs of inexplicable difficulties.

               </gap>ſite for a circulating medium. Hitherto money cannot be ſaid to have had a fair circulation; for almoſt all the money expended by the public has been created and iſſued as occaſion required, without ever returning again into the public treaſury. But as the creation of money is to ceaſe, and it will in future travel its full round in circulation, I ſhould ſuppoſe that commerce would find full employ for the uſual quantity—ſay twenty five millions of dollars. The quantity now in circulation is is about one hundred and ſixty mill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, and if the depreciation is to be computed in mathematical proportion to the exceſs of the quantity, it ſhould at this rate be but latle more than ſix for one. This mode of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, however, is not always juſt, eſpecially while the exceſs is increaſing: but this will be conſidered under another head in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the imaginary cauſes of depreciation: I here ſpeak mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the natural cauſe.—exceſs of quantity. We have the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Congreſs that the quantity ſhall not ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, yet, as it MAY happen, it may be fair to calculate upon it: the exceſs we may ſuppoſe will then be as eight for one. This I call the natural cauſe of depreciation; the cauſes which follow I ſhall for the ſake of diſtinction call imaginary.</p>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe of the great depreciation of money is its not being eſtabliſhed on proper funds to be redeemed at certain periods.</p>
            <p>The money has been iſſued on the mere authority of Congreſs,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016247_0004_0F9BD012CDB08440"/>who it is ſuppoſed have not in themſelves the power of redeeming a ſingle dollar of it. I do not mean to call in queſtion the authority of Congreſs to emit money, nor the propriety of their doing it. The circumſtances of the occaſion will probably juſtify it, and their conſtituents in the ſeveral States have, by le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſlative acts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliedly approved it; but they have not yet by direct and open acts aſſumed the redemption of it. That certainty which is uſual in ſuch caſes, and which the nature of the buſineſs requires, has not therefore been given; and to this want of certainty much of the preſent extravagant degree of depreciation may be imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted.</p>
            <p>A third cauſe of the depreciation is the want of a proper plan for raiſing future ſupplies to carry on the war without increaſing the quantity of money in circulation.</p>
            <p>Congreſs have been pleaſed to declare that they will not on any account extend their bills of credit to more than two hundred mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars, and it is not doubted but that they mean to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by their promiſe. But we know that the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r is not yet at an end; that large ſupplies of money will be neceſſary; that the remaining forty millions which they reſerve the liberty of emitting muſt ſhortly be expended, unleſs aided by other means; that taxes will not afford ſufficient aid in due ſeaſon; and that there does not appear that willingneſs in the money-holders to lend, on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent footing, which is neceſſary to inſure a ſufficient quantity: Neither does it appear that the Loan-officers are authorized to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the neceſſary quantity if it ſhould be offered. How then is the treaſury to be famiſhed? Congreſs, it is true have been pleaſed alſo to declare that <q>further ways and means of providing for the public exigences are now under conſideration, and will ſoon be laid before their conſtituents.</q> But what theſe ways and means are, when they will appear, and how far they will be effectual, are yet unknown to the public.</p>
            <p>Some effectual meaſures have long been expected, and we have been told for many months paſt that ſuch meaſures have been under the conſideration of Congreſs. When this expectation commenced, the whole amount of the depreciation of money, natural and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, was but four or five for one of ſterling. It is now —I dare not ſay how much. Has it kept pace with the quantities emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſince that time? It has abundently out run that proportion. Have our external affairs grown worſe in the mean time? On the contrary they have flouriſhed even beyond our hopes. What then can have occaſioned this dreadful panic—this diſtruſt of ourſelves which is driving us headlong to the brink of a dangerous preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice? What have we to fear? The circumſtances of our exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemy render them leſs an object of terror than of the ſofter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of humanity; and Providence has raiſed us up friends, and ſtrengthened our hands in a manner that gives us the faireſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016247_0005_0F9BD0135DC02E30"/>of ſeeing our independency eſtabliſhed on as firm a baſis as human affairs admit of, and of enjoying the bleſſings of PEACE, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al miſconduct in the management of our affairs? We all know that ſchemes of finance are a delicate ſubject, and that our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Meaſures that, co-operating with others in a general ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, might be very uſeful and proper, often prove miſchievous when put in practice ſeparately. I need produce no other proof of this than the ſcheme of calling in the emiſſions of May 1777, and April 1778. May we not with propriety, reſpecting our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſay that, by leaving undone thoſe things which we ought to have done, and by doing thoſe things which we ought not to have done, that faith which is the evidence of things not ſeen hath loſt us due influence, and there is no health in that confidence which is neceſſary to give due vigor to public meaſures?</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have conſidered the grand leading cauſes of depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. Let us take a curſory view of ſome of the branches which have ſprung from them. Theſe are too numerous to be minutely conſidered in an eſſay of this kind; and, viewed ſeparately, they may appear of trifl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng conſequence; but their aggregate effect is wonderfully great. One of the largeſt of theſe branches, which is again abundently ramified, is that intermediate traffic which has been ſo much complained of as a pernicious evil, between the firſt poſſeſſor of commodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, whether by importation, manufacture or otherwiſe, and the conſumer. This is in fact a natural effect of a continued courſe of depreciation; but, like the acceſſions of a ſnow-ball rolling down the ſide of a mountain, it increaſes the magnitude and velocity of its cauſe, and thus in turn itſelf becomes a cauſe. Much of this intermediate traffic is carried on merely for the ſake of private gain, regardleſs of other conſequences; but much is alſo done ſolely to avoid loſs. It is unneceſſary to attempt to enumerate the many arts and practices exerciſed by thoſe who are engaged in this kind of trade, or the various motives which, under the preſent circumſtances of the times, induce ſo many to become partakers in it: they are known to every intelligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Neither would I mention the general depravity of morals which at preſent ſeems to prevail in commercial tranſactions, but for the ſake of introducing an obſervation in which I find I differ from many I converſe with; and that is, that this depravity of morals ought to be conſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016247_0006_0F9BD01416176158"/>on the depreciation, but they have ſpent their force, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is become too contemptible to deſerve much ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>k of the people in the middle States with a ſerious apprehenſion that it would be put in practice. It operated like a report of a plague in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I have been told of inſtances of the notes of private perſons payable a few years hence, for leſs than a fourth of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and without any ſtipulation for a particular kind of money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preferred to the full ſum in ready money, on the ſtrength of this apprehenſion only. And though thinking men may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have harboured an idea ſo glaringly unju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s force. Is it poſſible ſo diſhonourable an idea could ever gain admittance in Congreſs? It ſurely is not. But their long delay of the meaſures neceſſary to contradict it, let a ſuſpicion take place which ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the pernicious apprehenſion, which has not yet ceaſed its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The multiplicity of buſineſs they had before them, and the obſtructions and difficulties they have met with on other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were not known abroad, and this delay was not fairly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid will be ſufficient to ſhew the propriety of the obſervation above hinted, that the degree of depreciation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, while it continues increaſing, will always exceed the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its exceſs in quantity. And I think it may be fairly infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that, as ſoon as the quantity of money ceaſes to increaſe, and what is in circulation ſhall be properly funded ſo as to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſecurity that it will be fairly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>edeemed at certain periods, theſe excreſſent cauſes of depreciation will ceaſe to operate, and money will ſoon be liquidated at its true value in proportion to the quantity in circulation.</p>
            <p>Before I ſtate my own plan for effecting this deſirable purpoſe, I beg leave to offer a few thoughts on ſome of the propoſitions I have met with in reading and in converſation.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to be generally agreed that our future ſupplies muſt be raiſed by taxes and loans. The difficulty ſeems to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in finding out in what way they are to be raiſed by either or both of theſe means, in ſufficient quantity and in due ſeaſon. Some are for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on taxes alone; but this I fear would leave us in the lurch.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016247_0007_0F9BD014D2A331C8"/>We all know that taxes are the dermier reſort, and that our public de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e diſcharged principally by them: but neceſſity has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the practice in all civilized countries, and more eſpecially thoſe of extenſive territory and inhabited by freemen, carrying on a war with money to the extent of their abilities, to anticipate their taxes by loans in ſome ſhape or other. And I conceive it to be ſo plainly impracticable for us in our preſent circumſtances to raiſe the neceſſary ſums in due ſeaſon by taxes only, that I ſhall ſpend no time in argument upon it. I ſhould nevertheleſs wiſh to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e taxation go on to as great an extent as the different Legiſlatures ſhall judge practicable within their r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It has been propoſed, and I am informed has obtained ſerious conſideration, that the diſterent States ſhould be called upon for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reſpective quotas of the neceſſary ſupplies of money, to be paid in quarterly or monthly, leaving it to the reſpective Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to raiſe it by taxes, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s future uſefulneſs; and, to whatever length it is carried for continental purpoſes, it ought to be kept as nearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual as poſſible in the different States. But of this I ſhall ſay more hereafter. As to loans I fear it is too late for this ſcheme to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The difficulty lies in the uncertain value of money. If there was no conſiderable degree of depreciation, or if the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation was ſettled at any certain rate with a probability of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing fixed for a courſe of time, the different States might make loans on an equal footing and on terms of certainty; but in the preſent ſituation of things I do not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e how they can do it without playing a very high game of chances, in which the odds will be greatly againſt the State. Money is now at a rate of depreciation vaſtly beyond what we may ſuppoſe it will remain at when matters come to be explained, and the neceſſary confidence in its final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption at a proper time again takes place. If then a State ſhould borrow from an individual at this high rate, ſay twenty for one, and money ſhould appreciate to ten for one at the time of repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would not the lender double his money? He is to receive the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me nominal ſum that he lent, which is become of double the value. For a State to fix a certain rate of depreciation at which to borrow, will be attended wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ry State, acting for itſelf, will probably differ from the reſt in fixing the rate; and whatever it may vary from the general rate which ſhall prevail at the time of repaying the loan, will be either profit or loſs to the State, and the reverſe to the lender, unleſs the lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016247_0008_0F9BD01597C84D78"/>the contract againſt any chance but that of gain. So far as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective States may borrow for their own ſeparate purpoſes, theſe chances are of leſs conſequence, becauſe as they lay out the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at its value at the time of borrowing, they reap the ſole bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or diſadvantage of its appreciation or depreciation, and gain in one way what they may loſe in another; but if they turn the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed money into the Continental <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> reaſury it is otherwiſe; the State runs the whole riſk, and the Continent receives the money at a certainty, that is, its nominal value. For theſe reaſons I do not think the States will ſeparately contract loans for Continental pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, unleſs Congreſs ſhall fix a rate by which they may do it on a plan of equality both as to the terms, and the quantity. Loans, eſpecially in the preſent fluctuating ſtate of money, appear to be properly a Continental buſineſs, and the contracts ſhould be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately between Congreſs and the lender, which will preſerve uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the plan, and equality in the chances of profit and loſs to the different States, and thereby prevent thoſe new ſcenes of job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and ſpeculation which would probably be conſequent upon loans on a great variety of terms, and which would hardly fail to create much jealouſy and diſcontent.</p>
            <p>Some have propoſed the levying in kind the articles wanted for public uſe. However plauſible this may appear in theory, it would in my opinion moſt certainly fail in practice. It may be likened to the laying aſide a regular army, and depending ſolely on the militia in monthly rotation to oppoſe the enemy. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be in ſome degree practicable, it would, ſo far as it went, deſtroy that uſe for money on which its value in a great meaſure depends, and render it more difficult to procure ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as muſt neceſſarily be purchaſed with it.</p>
            <p>I have, moreover, heard it alledged that the buſineſs reſts with the different States, and with the people at large, and that they do not manifeſt a proper diſpoſition to exert themſelves. I am far from thinking this allegation well ſounded: I believe on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they are heartily diſpoſed to uſe the neceſſary exertions if they were put in a way in which they might confidently ſuppoſe they were acting in concert. But to what purpoſe are the exertions of individuals acting ſeparately and unconn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>edly, and perhaps counteracting each other? How can it be expected they will act vigorouſly under ſuch diſcouragements? And who can with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety mark out the way in which their efforts ſhall effectually tend to one point, but that body in whom the ſovereignty of the whole is lodged? Congreſs, with reſpect to the United States, is as the Legiſlature of a particular State to the individuals of which it is compoſed; and though they may not, perhaps, in all caſes <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> with the force of a law, they may <hi>recommend</hi> with ſufficient force to effect the purpoſe. Shall the buſineſs be delayed becauſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016247_0009_0F9BD01651B5A930"/>the beſt mode poſſible cannot be agreed upon? This, in our preſent ſituation, would be like mariners diſputing which way they ſhould ſteer, and leaving the ſails flapping while the veſſel is drifting on a le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-ſhore. Some one way muſt certainly be the beſt; but any one of ſeveral that are ſuppoſed to be in our choice, would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to remain either idle or at croſs purpoſes: and this way whatever it may be, muſt be directed by Congreſs.</p>
            <p>One propoſition more I beg leave to obſerve upon; becauſe, however plauſible and ſpecious in appearance, I take it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with a moſt dangerous and deſtructive poiſon, and extremely ſalacious: I mean what comes under the idea that the public debt is diſcharged, or diminiſhed <hi>pro tanto,</hi> by the depreciation of money operating as a tax on the poſſeſſors of it, and on thoſe who have received and muſt receive it in payment of debts? And is this an equal and juſt tax? Let us enquire on whom, and in what proportion this tax falls. It will be found, ſo far as it has yet ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, to have fallen chiefly upon the <hi>aged,</hi> the <hi>infirm, widows, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rphans, public inſtitutions,</hi> the <hi>army, officers of government,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>zealous actors in and ſupporters of the revelation,</hi> many of whom are already reduced from eaſy, yea affluent circumſtances to the moſt diſtreſſing poverty by the wonderful magic of this cunning mode of taxation; while a large proportion of thoſe who are to enjoy the benefit of the prize we are contending for, have ſtudied to withhold both their property and their perſonal ſervices, and to keep themſelves uppormoſt on the wheel, turn which way it might. But this is not all; for in the end it will be found that the greater part of the profit of this injuſtice has redounded to crafty and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing individuals, many of whom have obtained it by means about as honourable as ſecreting their neighbours goods depoſited in their cuſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y in time of a fire, or concealing a purſe accidentally found in the ſtreet. The public in fact have derived no benefit from it, and if it had, would any honeſt member of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity wiſh to be exempted from paying his proportion of taxes by ſuch means? As well might he wiſh the army to levy its own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the unfortunate part of the country through which it might happen to paſs. The ſpecious ſuppoſition that the public debt is to be computed at the preſent rate of depreciation, or at whatever rate it may arrive at, is a mere deluſion. It appears to me clearly that whatever ground we have paſſed over in the courſe of depreciation, muſt at ſome time and in ſome ſhape or other, be retrodden in a courſe of appreciation, that is, in diſcharging the public debt; for, as the quantity is diminiſhed, the reſidue will riſe in weight as long as any depreciation remains. The great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to thoſe who have been the moſt ſeverely oppreſſed by the depreciation is, that they will not in turn be peculiarly benefited by the appreciation: their private loſſes have become the private
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016247_0010_0F9BD01710A707F0"/>gain of other individuals who can be no otherwiſe reached by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral laws than as their extraordinary wealth makes them greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of taxation; and therefore if any relief is given to private ſufferers, it muſt be by ſpecial acts, and not by general regulations.</p>
            <p>If theſe obſervations are juſt, it is clear that the public have not been benefited by the depreciation of the money; and I think it ſtill more clear that all the debt created at a depreciation beyond the natural degree ariſing from the exceſs of quantity of the money in circulation, muſt be contracted at a diſadvantage to the public. Whenever depreciation ceaſes its progreſſive motion, thoſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cauſes, which have ſwelled it to its preſent enormous ſize, will ſubſide, and, like a river which hath been ſwelled by exceſſive rain, it will retire within its proper banks and be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to us natural ſize; and conſequently all the debt muſt be paid off in the different gradations from that mark to the original value, that is, an equality with gold and ſilver. It may be ſaid that, by means of a bank in Europe, a deep ſtroke may be made in the public debt at the preſent rate of depreciation. This I would readily admit if we had now ſuch a bank exiſting: But I know of no other way to create it but by a foreign loan: that loan is not yet negociated, and of courſe it will require a good deal of time, ſuppoſing ſuch a loan practicable, to get the bank eſtabliſhed; and I much fear that by keeping our affairs afloat in their preſent wild, unſtable condition during that time, we ſhould ſuffer greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief than the profits of the ſcheme would compenſate. The thought puts me in mind of a man who to gain half a crown in a bargain would expend five ſhillings in liquor to intoxicate the other party and bring him to a proper temper for his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>From what I have ſaid I truſt it will not be underſtood that I am an advocate for the appreciating of money farther than may be neceſſary to bring it to a ſteady, known, and certain value; but to this point I think it is our indiſpenſible duty to bring it as ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily as poſſible. To eſtabliſh this poſition, I could, if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, add a variety of political as well as moral arguments; but I preſume it is too obvious to need illuſtration. I ſhall therefore proceed to ſtate the plan which appears to me moſt likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this effect. In doing this I ſhall lay aſide the idea of a foreign loan; not that I am oppoſed to it, for I think, judiciouſly managed, it might be uſed to good purpoſe, but becauſe it is not within our reach for immediate uſe.</p>
            <p>The plan I propoſe conſiſts of the following parts:
<list>
                  <item>1. Funding the bills of credit emitted.</item>
                  <item>2. A domeſtic loan for current ſupplies, and</item>
                  <item>3. Taxation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And 1ſt as to funding the bills emitted: I would propoſe that it be recommended by Congreſs to the ſeveral legiſlatures to paſs laws
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016247_0011_0F9BD017D35C11E8"/>acknowledging their ſeveral quotas reſpectively as a debt upon the State, and making proviſion for redeeming it by taxes at certain periods, to commence at a given time after the war ſhall be ended. This would fix it on a ſolid foundation, and add greatly to the confidence of the people in its intrinſic as well as extrinſic value. What I mean-by its intrinſic value is, the ſum it will be worth at the time of its redemption, deducting compound intereſt from the time of reckoning till that period. By its extrinſic value I mean its uſefulneſs as a medium of commerce in the mean time. This depends ſo much on general opinion, or, in other words, a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it will be fairly redeemed at a certain period, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be left undone which would tend to ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh this confidence. The reaſon why I propoſe that the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of redemption ſhould commence at ſome time after the war ſhall be ended, will appear in the next ſection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A domeſtic loan for current ſupplies. I would propoſe that an eſtimate be made of the ſum that will probably be wanted for fix, nine, or twelve months; and that a loan be opened for this ſum at a certain rate of depreciation, to be meaſured either by the price of exchange for ſterling money, or livres of I rance, or the price of wheat or ſome other ſtaple commodity of the country. But as ſcarcely any one commodity can be found that will bear ſo even a price univerſally throughout the United States as bills of exchange, I ſhould think the price of exchange the beſt ſtandard. Let it be computed as nearly as may be, what is the true degree of depreciation of money from the exceſs of quantity and ſuch other circumſtances as are not at preſent removeable; that is, at what rate the value of money will be liquidated in the courſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, when confidence ſhall be reſtored in its foundation and ſtability, and let this be the rate at which it ſhall be borrowed. Where this line will fall is not aſcertained; nor do I think ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs on the preſent occaſion, neceſſary. I muſt, however, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a rate in order to explain my meaning the more fully; but whether I take it a few degrees too high or too low, is not material; the ſcheme may be accommodated to any number that ſhall be thought beſt. For the preſent then, let us ſuppoſe this line of depreciation to be at eight for one.</p>
            <p>This will hold up a view of profit to the holders of money that will probably inſure a ſpeedy ſupply. And this I think neceſſary, becauſe, to this purpoſe, the public and individuals who are to lend the money, have diſtinct and ſeparate intereſts from each other. In vain will it be ſaid, that theſe perſons are part of the community, and ought to contribute all in their power to its welfare. The community and they are placed in oppoſition to each other as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting parties, each conſulting its own intereſt in the bargain, and trying to make it as favourable to itſelf as it can. So far as relates
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016247_0012_0F9BD0188F9282E0"/>to pecuniary matters, the patriotiſm of every individual is ſatisfied if he contributes his proportion in the way pointed out by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is in perſonal and mental ſervices that patriotiſm exhibits its extraordinary efforts. Loans are therefore to be obtained only by holding up terms of advantage to the lender. Such terms do not always imply the diſadvantage of the borrower, and even where they do, it may be more than balanced by avoiding greater evils, or obtaining proportionate benefit. It is moreover to the honor as well as to the intereſt of the public, to offer ſuch terms as will <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> rather than <hi>ſolicit</hi> the requiſite ſupplies.</p>
            <p>In order to give every one an equal chance of ſubſcribing to the loan, let the ſum wanted be divided in due proportions ſo that every State may take its quota, provided it be ſubſcribed within a certain limited time,—ſay two months, after proper notice that the office is open: and if the quota is not ſubſcribed in that time, let other States, whole inhabitants are more willing to ſubſcribe, have the benefit of doing it. And the better to accomodate the ſubſcribers, allow them a certain reaſonable time after ſubſcription for paying in part of the money; and let the Loan-officers be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized and directed to appoint deputies in different parts ſo as beſt to accomodate the people.</p>
            <p>For every eight hundred dollars ſubſcribed and paid in, give the ſubſcriber a bill or certificate for 500 livres of France, bearing intereſt at ſix per cent, per annum, redeemable in current money either at the rate of eight dollars for five livres, or at the current rate of bills of exchange on France at the time fixed for payment, at the option of the poſſeſſor of the certificate: the intereſt to be paid annually in the like manner. It may be beſt that Congreſs ſhould reſerve the liberty of redeeming theſe bilis at any time after one year, giving reaſonable (ſay three months) notice of ſuch their intention, in order that they may check the appreciation of money if it ſhould be likely to paſs the line at which they have borrowed. And for this purpoſe and as a farther check on the value of money, I would propoſe that all the money which the different States can turn into the Continental Treaſury by taxes during the war, be reſerved by Congreſs as a fund to be appropriated as they may find occaſion from time to time, to the payment of intereſt, the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe loan-bills, or the reducing of the quantity of money in circulation. By theſe means money may be kept at a ſteady certain value, which I take to be an object of great importance and worthy of the firſt attention. Whatever ſurplus of the taxes may remain, may then be uſed in common expenditures and thereby leſſen the occaſion for future loans; but I would wiſh to ſee the firſt loan calculated for a full ſupply without any reliance on taxes for current expences, as well to avoid diſappointment, as to inſure the liquidation of the value of money to a certainty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:016247_0013_0F9BD0194F8EC5D8"/>
If to this plan of borrowing when digeſted and put into form, Congreſs ſhould ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a recommendation to the Legiſlatures of the reſpective States to paſs laws or reſolutions to aid the carrying it into execution, it would almon infallibly inſure it ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Taxation. This is a buſineſs that lies chiefly with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures of the reſpective States, and each may differ from another as to the means and manner of raiſing its quota, without injury to the buſineſs of the Continental Finances. I therefore take no farther notice of it in this place, than as I conceive it to come within the duty of Congreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who may with propriety recommend as to the time, and the quantity of money to be raiſed for Continental pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Such recommendations ſeem indeed to be neceſſary in order to keep the different States as nearly as may be on an equal footing in this reſpect; for though it may, and probably will prove bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to thoſe Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s, which, by early exertions, ſhall run foremoſt in diſcharging their quota of the public debt; yet many conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, which need not now be mentioned, point out the propriety of keeping them nearly equal. I ſhould therefore think it moſt adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>able in Concreſs to calculate their requiſitions upon a ſcale that even the hindmoſt may probably cenform to, barring extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary circumſtances ſuch as the preſent ſituation of Georgia; at the ſame time not diſcouraging thoſe who may chooſe to exceed it.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs before I conclude, to take notice of ſome objections which I have heard ſuggeſted againſt any plan of this kind.</p>
            <p>Some gentlemen are ſo extremely tenacious of the honor of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that they ſeem diſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to hazard any conſequences, rather than any public acknowledgment ſhould be made, even by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that money is depreciated; as they ſuppoſe ſuch acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment would be a breach of public faith. This I take to be nicety in the extreme. I would by all means be as tender of the national honor as is conſiſtent with its health; but I would not nurſe its complexion ſo far as to neglect its ſtrength and uſefulneſs. If the propoſed plan of borrowing had any tendency to injure former contracts, there might be ſome weight in this objection; but it is propoſed merely as a ſeparate, independent and temporary affair, having neither relation to nor connection with the former contracts ſubſiſting between the public and individuals, farther than as it may tend to enable the public to comply with its engagements. The bills of credit may nevertheleſs, in due ſeaſon be redeemed in the ordinary courſe by taxes, at their nominal value, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to depreciation, and former loans may be paid off on the ſame terms and in the ſame manner as if this ſcheme had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. It may indeed haſten the time at which they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed on proper terms, and the lenders may, in the mean time, receive their intereſt at leſs diſadvantage, but I ſee not how it will
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016247_0014_0F9BD01A15708680"/>otherwiſe affect them, What ground then have we for the exerciſe of this falſe pride? And whither would it lead us, but to ſtruggle on in our preſent courſe till we get ſo deeply entangled that we can by no means extricate ourſelves but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cutting the cord, and by a general craſh annihilating our infant national character.</p>
            <p>Some are oppoſed to all loans whether foreign or domeſtic, and are for relying altogether upon taxes. Theſe I would leave to be combated by thoſe who are for throwing the whole burden of our taxes upon poſterity, as I look upon both the propoſitions to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eligible extremes</p>
            <p>It has been ſuggeſted that a domeſtic loan would not check the depreciation, becauſe the loan certificates, being negoctable, would operate as an increaſe of the circulating medium. I am of opinion they would have rather a contrary effect. It will take ſome time to reduce and ſettle money at its ſtandard value; during that time the certificates would be of ſo much more value than the bills of credit that no one would offer them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n lieu of money. This ſtandard value of money when ſettled will nor be better than the mere principal of the certificates; the growing intereſt will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep the latter more valuable, and they will remain locked up as a precious kind of property, or become objects of purchaſe which would enhance the value of money by increaſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s uſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations ſuppoſe an apparent appreciation of money, and hence ariſes another objection, viz. That it increaſes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional debt by ſo much as the money appreciates in value. The idea on which this objection is founded I take to be illuſive. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly conſidered, the meaſures propoſed, ſuppoſing them to have the defired effect, will not work any real appreciation: it will only reduce money to its natural and proper ſtate, like an ingredient thrown into fermenting or boiling liquor to ſubſide the froth and reduce its ſurface to a proper level. Will any one pretend that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe money is at preſent blown up by unnatural cauſes, as it were, into a bubble, we are to ſeize the occaſion and meaſure its contents by its ſurface? As well might we take the depth of water in a river by meaſuring from the top of the ſurge in a ſtorm.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid alſo that theſe terms will afford too great an advantage to the money-holders, who have purchaſed it, and therefore can afford to part with it, at a much greater rate of depreciation; and that, as prices will not ſuddenly come down to the proper rate, it will be too great a ſacrifice of the public intereſt to borrow money at a depreciation of eight for one, and iſſue it at fifteen or twenty. —Arguments of this kind are like placing a farthing ſo near the eye as to obſcure a broad piece at a diſtance: And beſides, they prove too much. A conſiderable part of the money emitted has been iſſued at a par with gold and ſilver, and at different rates of depreciation within the fine now propoſed to be drawn. Would not this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016247_0015_0F9BD01AD123C1A0"/>hold up to the individuals who received it at theſe rates, a claim of compenſation for all the depreciation ſince they received it? The public treaſury muſt be ſupplied; and the means neceſſary to obtain that ſupply muſt be uſed. This appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſacrifice on the part of the public (though in effect it amounts to little) appears to me abſolutely neceſſary as the only means by which a ſufficient ſupply can be raiſed in due ſeaſon. I doubt not but that a conſiderable ſum of money might be raiſed on a more ſcanty plan; but unleſs a ſum ſufficient for the purpoſe is procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would fail of the proper effect. And ſhall we riſk our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on doubtful experiments when a failure might prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal? Great affairs muſt be managed on a large and liberal ſcale. Many conſiderations which claim our attention in the oeconomy of our private affairs, ceaſe to pertain to oeconomy in larger concerns. Too great an attention to ſmall ſavings in national affairs not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occaſions the loſs of great advantages.</p>
            <p>The evils ariſing from the inſtability and want of force in money are too numerous to admit of particular mention, and too glaring not to be ſeen. Turn which way we will they preſent themſelves to our view. All our public dapartments are labouring in the midſt of difficulties which daily threaten their total obſtruction; theſe I apprehend will in a great meaſure vaniſh the moment the propoſed ſcheme ſhews its power of ſucceſs. We may want large ſupplies of articles to be purchaſed for years to come, the prices of which will depend on the value of money: If therefore this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure will place money on ſuch a footing as to reſtore its activity and uſefulneſs as a medium, and reduce prices to a ſettled ſtandard, how much more valuable is the object than the expence of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it? Thouſands of thoſe who now devote themſelves to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purſuit than ſpeculating in a deſtructive intermediate traffic be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the importer and the conſumer of goods, would be turned to uſeful employments, or at leaſt become harmleſs members of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. A great part of that legion of ſubalterns now neceſſary to effect the buſineſs of the ſtaff departments of the army, inſtead of being incumbents upon, would become more uſeful members of the community. The neceſſary ſupplies for the army, which are now with difficulty found in their various receſſes, reluctantly parted with by their reſpective owners, and drawn to the proper magazines at an amazing expence of labour as well as money, would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for ſale in plenty at the moſt convenient places for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Commerce would again reſume its natural courſe, in which alone it can flouriſh, and every individual of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the wonted eaſe would be accomodated by ſupplying his wants, and diſpoſing of ſuch commodities to advantage as he might have to ſpare. Induſtry, the only true ſource of wealth and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016247_0016_0F9BD01B9CE16308"/>ſtrength, would be excited, and the neceſſaries and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of life would abound even in the midſt of war.</p>
            <p>But a conſideration of more immediate weight in our preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances is the probability of its ſhortening the duration of the war. The remaining hopes of conqueſt, which for ſome time paſt have had little elſe but the derangement of our finances to keep them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the minds of our enemies, would expire on our effecting a proper reformation in this reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They would then probably give over the deluſive purſuit and ſeek for peace; or at leaſt apply their force to other objects ſo as to relieve us from the great exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their continued invaſions have hitherto occaſioned.</p>
