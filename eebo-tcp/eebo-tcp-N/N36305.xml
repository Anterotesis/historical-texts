            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Laſt Words, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I WAS born in the back parts of Virginia, where I lived by the name of Peter, till I arrived to the age of manhood. My maſter, was called Lawyer Jones, who treated me like a ſlave. I began early to take things from my maſter, &amp; when I was found out, he whipped me, or ordered the negro driver to do it; but ſtill I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtealing, and lying to hide it. At length I ran away from my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and kept in the woods by day, and by night ſtole bread, meat, and other things from the neighbours. I was caught &amp; whipped ſeveral times. I then went to another county, where I continued near a year, living with Mr. William Scott, as a waiter. Here I followed my old practice of ſtealing, and kept a woman. Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying my maſter, he threatned to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:047425_0003_1023A39F377FB3E0"/>
whip me; but I ran away, and went to Mr. William M'Donald's in Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phries county, where I continued my practice of taking things and lying with women. Thence I went to Louden county, changing my name every time I changed my place. Here I went by the name of Shadrach, and hired myſelf to Mr. Abraham, Milton, a waggoner. I continued in this county about 3 or 4 years, taking things that were not my own, and lying with women, by whom I had children. From thence went to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, and ſhipped by the name of Edmund, with Samuel Love, and Hugh Stuart, merchants, for Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool in England. While the ſhip was unloading, ſome flour was miſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I being ſuſpected and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned puniſhment, tho' innocent of the crime, ran away and engaged on board an English ſhip, went to Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and thence came to Wiſcaſſett. On the paſſage I took things, but was not found out. At Wiſcaſſett I ſtole
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:047425_0004_1023A3A0C9B06090"/>
bread, &amp;c. out of the ſhip, which I ſold, and was detected. I ran away from the ſhip and was caught; but running away a ſecond time, I went to Swan Iſland on Kenebeck river, and thence to Hallowell, where I ſtroled about from place to place, having no home or employment for ſome time. Here I ſtole wheat and ſome meat from Col. Dutton, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtole from the neighbours. About this time I married Lydia, and lived in Hallowell on the eaſt ſide of Kenebeck river. Now my life was dreadful—Drinking, ſtealing and gaming.</p>
            <p>After about a year I moved to Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalborough, where I continued my wicked courſes for more than a year longer, until I committed the laſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid crimes againſt God, upon that poor PAMELA TILTON.—On Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the 18ht of May, the ſun about two hours high in the afternoon, I began to carry ſome of my ſtuff to a houſe to which I had before deſigned
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047425_0005_1023A3A39C8813C0"/>
to move, and ſeeing the track of a girl, as I ſuppoſed, thought that if I could meet with her, I would have my will of her. I ſoon ſaw her in a place where two ways met, and ſtept aſide till ſhe came near; then throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf into the way or road, ſpoke and ſaid how do you do, let me lie with you: She anſwered, "no I was not brought up to ſuch things." I then took her by the arm and carried her into the woods: She ſcreamed and to prevent her noiſe, I took hold of her throat, threw her down and committed a crime againſt innocence. She then aſked me to ſhew her the way home, or out of the woods: After I had my will of her the ſecond time, ſhe begged me to carry her to her father's bars. To this I conſented, if ſhe would not bring me out, but I carried her the wrong way. When ſhe ſaw an opening (for it began to be dark) ſhe aſked me if it were her father's and ſaid "I am afraid you are going to carry me into the wilderneſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047425_0006_1023A3AB59F172F0"/>
to deſtroy me." I promiſed the<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

I told her that I would ſhew her the way home, if ſhe would not expoſe me: She ſaid that ſhe would not; but fearful that ſhe would diſcover my crime, I took her by the throat, ſtrangled her, and endeavoured to hide the body under a log by covering it with ſome bark and rotten wood. But how ſhall I deſcribe my feelings on my return home! Oh how dreadful they were! I could not reſt all night. The next morning I went to the place where I had hidden her body, in order to conceal it better; and as it was not far from the road I travelled in to move my goods, I could not help looking that way towards the body and thought if ſhe ſhould be found, the neighbours would miſtruſt me.—Search being made, the body was found on the next Tueſday: I was near and went to the place where the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> guilt obliged me to confeſs, and I was committed to goal. I attempted every means to eſcape from priſon, and had like to have got out.</p>
            <p>On Friday, a little more than a week before I was araigned at the bar, I was in great diſtreſs of mind; and though I tried to ſleep I could not; my diſtreſs of mind ſeemed to parch me up; I thought the Lord had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me; that there was no mercy for me, who was ſo guilty; then I believe I got into a drowſineſs, and it ſeemed as if my breath was taken from me, and when I came to myſelf, it ſeemed as if my ſpirit would fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the Devil was with me and ſaid "if you had killed your wife I ſhould have had you." I anſwered no? Then I thought I heard a voice, ſaying, "the Lord will have mercy." I tried to pray, but all my prayers
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047425_0008_1023A3AFD774DA30"/>
rather made me worſe than better. I continued ſtriving to pray, and as I uſed to mock folks, and make games at them, ſo I thought I was mocking God. For ſome time t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thought the Lord would have th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mercy on me, who had no mercy <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> my fellow creature that was better than I; and as it was near day I thought I would lie down and try to ſleep; but I could not reſt; there was no comfort or peace for me: I tho't no perſon was ſo bad as I my whole life filled with ſin, ſtealing, lying, whoring and drinking, and now murder. At length I got up, and endeavoured to pray, but my heart was hard as a ſtone, and it ſeemed bound up; ſtill I thought I would keep praying to the Lord whether he had mercy on me or not.</p>
            <p>On Saturday morning it ſeemed as if I had more deſire to pray and plead with God than before; and in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon it ſeemed as if my heart was in ſome degree melted, and there was
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047425_0009_1023A3B3E7FEA5C0"/>
ſome hope. I heard ſomething like a voice, ſaying "verily verily give him a new heart," and it ſeemed as if a man was in me working downward, and clearing or cleanſing my heart. I thought I could breathe out my heart to God, and could ſee a light ſhining from heaven, brighter than ſnow, and in the light it ſeemed as though a great many angels were ſinging, which drowned my groans and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and I cried O Lord! and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and I ſaw in a corner of the priſon, ſomething red like fire, and thought it was the Devil. I found I had another feeling, and I cried to the Lord. I now felt reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but was doubtful whether it could be true that the Lord had mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me, and wanted to ſee the light again.</p>
            <p>On Lord's day morning I felt more contented; but could hardly believe what I ſaw, and felt. I looked out of the grates, and all things looked ſtrange, as it in another place; the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:047425_0010_1023A3B58FF8FD40"/>
birds ſeemed to come near the Goal and ſing. Putting myſelf in the ſame place where I firſt law the light, I prayed, and ſaid, O Lord, for thy dear Son Jeſus ſake, who died for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, have mercy on me! And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the ſame angels began to ſing again; and I believed in the Lord, and loved every body. I felt cool and calm; all the dread and fear which I had ſuffered were gone.</p>
            <p>When I was brought to the bar, a gentleman ſpoke to me, and adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to plead <hi>not guilty:</hi> Oh! I thought he wanted me to lie againſt God; and I conſidered how dreadful it was for a man that could read to give ſuch advice. When the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was read, and the judge aſked me whether I was guilty or not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I felt very calm, and anſwered, guilty. And when I was brought the next day to hear my ſentence, I felt perfectly reſigned and thankful to the court, God knows their ſentence was juſt. I now wait for the laſt ſtroke
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:047425_0011_1023A3B9A6569728"/>
of death. I can truſt my ſoul in the hands of the Lord, and am willing to do, or ſuffer any thing God ſhall lay upon me; and if he ſhould caſt me off, it will be right for I deſerve it.</p>
            <p>And now, as a dying man, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the charity, of Chriſtian neighbours, my diſtreſſed wife <hi>Lydia,</hi> whom I leave with two ſmall child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, deſtitute of every thing to help themſelves with, and ſhe big with child. And I deſire the prayers of all good people to God for them and myſelf.</p>
