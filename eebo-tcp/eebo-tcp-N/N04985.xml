         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The INTRODUCTION.</p>
            <p>PREVIOUS to my Entrance upon the <hi>Vindication</hi> itſelf, I would obſerve, that I have credible Information, that that <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> is highly recommended by many; and has had, a few Days after the firſt, a ſecond <hi>Edition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> who is the <hi>Author</hi> thereof, is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to examine my Sermon with the ſevereſt <hi>Scrutiny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I am miſtaken in any Particular in it, I am willing to receive better <hi>Light</hi> and Information from any <hi>Quarter,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Fas eſt, et ab hoſte deceri.</note> and to alter my <hi>Opinion</hi> upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction by <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> for it is TRUTH and the PUBLICK SAFETY, and not <hi>Victory,</hi> I ſeek.</p>
            <p>And doubtleſs, the aforeſaid <hi>Gentleman</hi> has a Right to expreſs his Sentiments as well as any others: Nor can I think that <hi>Truth</hi> will loſe Ground by proper <hi>Enquiries;</hi> we are all <hi>Men,</hi> and therefore <hi>fallible Creatures,</hi> liable to manifold Miſtakes<note n="†" place="bottom">Homo ſum, et humanum nil a me alienum puto.</note>.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time I can't but admire at the Title of his <hi>Performance!</hi> He is pleas'd to call it, <hi>A Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Doctrine of Chriſtianity; as held by the People called</hi> QUAKERS; which ſeems to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that I had attack'd that <hi>Society</hi> in particular in my Sermon, which I have not done, nor any other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:006247_0006_10281FE9B5B40FE8"/>I had no <hi>Party-View</hi> in that <hi>Diſcourſe:</hi> No! my <hi>Deſign</hi> was, and ſtill is <hi>Catholick;</hi> namely, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, according to my Capacity, <note n="*" place="bottom">Pro viribus.</note> the common <hi>Safety</hi> of all the <hi>Societies</hi> in the <hi>Colony;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not intermeddle with <hi>Party-Diſputes</hi> in the Courſe of this Debate, any farther than I judge neceſſary to open the <hi>Cauſe</hi> in <hi>Controverſy,</hi> whatever Provocation has been given thereto notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: No! I reſolve to keep to the generous <hi>Plan</hi> upon which I have embark'd, and to contend by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Argument,</hi> for the <hi>Protection</hi> of our <hi>Author,</hi> and the <hi>Society</hi> to which he belongs, as well as others, how diſpleas'd ſoever perhaps he is, or may be, with my <hi>Concern</hi> and <hi>Endeavours</hi> that Way!</p>
            <p>Surely this <hi>Gentleman</hi> muſt needs know, that there are divers Perſons in this <hi>Colony,</hi> and that of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Denominations,</hi> beſides the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> as well as many of them? Why therefore ſhould he apply the Sermon to them parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, more than to others of the ſame Way of thinking in that Point?</p>
            <p>When I think it my <hi>Duty</hi> to attack any <hi>Society</hi> in particular about their <hi>Principles,</hi> I will endeavour to defend my <hi>Charge</hi> as well as I can; but till then, I deſire to be excus'd.</p>
            <p>As to this <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s Intention in the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance aforeſaid, I charitably hope it is as he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it in his Preface.

            </p>
            <p>My Purpoſe at preſent is to enquire into the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Cauſe in Controverſy, and to reflect no more upon our <hi>Author</hi>'s Management of it (and that with <hi>Reluctance</hi> and Regret) than <hi>Juſtice</hi> to the aforeſaid important <hi>Cauſe</hi> neceſſarily requires.</p>
            <p>Perſonal Reflections are certainly of little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Controverſy: <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould be received for its own ſake, with <hi>Candour</hi> and Readineſs, by whomſoever it is propoſed, let their <hi>Denomination</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> be what it will, ſeeing the Qualities of the Perſon ſpeaking or writing, cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nature of the <hi>Truths</hi> they communicate, or in the leaſt alter them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Method</hi> I propoſe for my <hi>Reply,</hi> is juſt to examine the <hi>Force</hi> of the <hi>Objections</hi> offered againſt the <hi>Arguments</hi> of my Sermon.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> begins his <hi>Animadverſions,</hi> by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Deliverance to which my <hi>Text</hi> refers, was <hi>miraculous</hi>—wrought without any human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance or Force.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Who has ſaid any Thing to the Contrary? It was not from any Suppoſition of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s fighting, at that Time (tho' they were prepared for it, and under Arms) that I drew any Inference in Favour of my Sentiment; but from the FIGHTING of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s GOD, and the juſt TITLE aſcrib'd to him on that Occaſion, <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>is a</hi> MAN <hi>of</hi> WAR.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> again obſerves very juſtly, that the Command to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when cloſely purſued by their Enemies, was, <hi>Fear ye not, ſtand ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of God, the Lord ſhall fight for you:</hi> But wasn't there good Reaſon for their Standing ſtill, when God promiſed to fight for them in a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Manner? Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> obſerves, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſtanding ſtill, denotes the calm Poſture of their <hi>Minds,</hi> and not of their Bodies <note n="§" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Annotat. in Loc.</note>: But if any incline to extend the Senſe further, even to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I ſhall not contend; no, tho' they themſelves ſhould conform thereto in their own Practice, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they can get a Promiſe from God, that he will fight miraculouſly for them.</p>
            <p>But by the by, I confeſs I am ſurpriz'd! that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Children of Men, ſhould be ſo bold, as to repreſent that to be <hi>Evil</hi> in itſelf, and abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which they may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive God himſelf has done, <hi>The Lord ſhall fight for you, Exod.</hi> xiv. 13. as if it was wicked and contrary to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to be like <hi>God;</hi> O ſtrange unaccountable Notion! I forbear to give it the Name, which, in my Opinion, it really deſerves!</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Author</hi> proceeds to ſay, <q>Tho' ſome Wars were commanded of God, under that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and therefore theſe Appellations, <hi>A Man of War, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> &amp;c. were then ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and proper, yet I cannot, ſaith he, perceive that they diſcover any Approbation <hi>of War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006247_0009_10281FF5D290D2A8"/>
and carried on at the mere Will and Pleaſure of Men,</hi> I rather take them to denote the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Power and Superiority,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Juſtneſs</hi> and Propriety of an <hi>entire Dependance upon God.</hi>
               </q> And then the Caſe of <hi>Gideon</hi> is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, who at the Command of God, reduced his Army from 32,000 to 300, and put the mighty <hi>Hoſt</hi> of the <hi>Midianites</hi> to Flight; <q>Here (ſays our Author) tho' the Uſe of outward Means was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, a ſtrong and entire Dependance upon God was required, even in that Day: Can ſuch a Dependance be leſs neceſſary in a Day of Goſpel Light?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here obſerve, that our Author acknowledges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, in the above Paragraph, theſe three Things, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>

                  <item>2. That the aforeſaid Appellations of <hi>Man of War, &amp;c.</hi> were ſuitable and proper then.</item>
                  <item>3. That tho' the Uſe of outward Means was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, a ſtrong and entire Dependance upon God was required even in that Day.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the aforeſaid Conceſſions, I would propoſe the following Queries, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1, Can it be reaſonably ſuppoſed that the Almighty can command at any Time what is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Nature or Approbation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 2. Is the Almighty God changed now in his <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> from what he was under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation? Doesn't the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That <hi>He is far from the Shadow of Change?</hi> Now if the Almighty does not, cannot change, in the aforeſaid Reſpects, then I query,</p>
            <p n="3">3. How comes our Author, Page 3, 4. after he had mentioned my Endeavour to prove from my Text, and ſome other Appellations given to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006247_0010_10281FF967AB9808"/>
in the Old Teſtament, <hi>viz, The Lord of Hoſts, The God of the Armies of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> to prove from thence that War was agreeable to him, to inſert under the Margin this Text, <hi>Lam.</hi> iii. 33. <hi>The Lord doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men;</hi> if it be not to prove a Change in God's Nature, is it not impertinent to the Point un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Debate? And if it be, how ſhocking is the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine our Author advances? For if <hi>God</hi> changes in his <hi>Nature,</hi> he muſt grow better or worſe; if better, he was imperfect before the Change; if worſe, he is imperfect after it; and conſequently either Way he cannot be God!.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 4. How comes our Author to paſs by in entire Silence the Argument I advanced in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon he oppoſes, to prove that <hi>War</hi> is approved of by the Almighty, which is this (Page 6) <q>And can we think Sirs, that the Almighty would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a Name contrary to his Nature, or ſuffer himſelf to be called by any Thing he diſlikes or deteſts?</q> If our Author thinks that <hi>Defenſive War</hi> is contrary to the Divine Nature, why didn't he anſwer that Queſtion in the Negative, and ſpeak out fairly?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 5. Why does our <hi>Author</hi> in the aforeſaid Paragraph change the State of the Queſtion, and ſpeak of a War <hi>begun and purſued at the meer Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Will of Men?</hi> Have I not in ſtating the Queſtion under Debate, expreſly oppoſed ſuch a wicked <hi>offenſive War,</hi> in theſe Words; (Page 6, 7) <q>That Kind of War is not approved of by God, which is commenced merely to gratify the <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Avarice</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi>—Such <hi>Wars</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly unlawful; and likewiſe all ſuch as are begun without a View to <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and carried on without <hi>Compaſſion</hi> and <hi>Humanity.</hi>
               </q> Is this candid Management? But I proceed:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:006247_0011_10281FFAF7E96A60"/>
               <hi>Query</hi> 6. Why does our <hi>Author,</hi> in the aforeſaid Paragraph, in order to remove the Force of my Argument from the aforeſaid Appellation (mention'd to prove God's Approbation of War) inſinuate ſome <hi>Contrariety</hi> between God's <hi>Approbation</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> and his <hi>Greatneſs, Power, Superiority, Sufficiency,</hi> and our <hi>Dependance</hi> on him: If ſuch a Contrariety be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated, how is his Gloſs ſupported? And if it be, how can it be prov'd contrary to the expreſs <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of the Almighty for <hi>War</hi> at that Time? Isn't it eaſy to conceive a ſweet <hi>Harmony</hi> in theſe Things? namely, God's being entitled a <hi>Man of War;</hi> his commanding <hi>Defenſive War;</hi> his approving what he commands; his preſiding over all <hi>Wars,</hi> by his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> and therefore a Neceſſity of our entire and continual <hi>Dependance</hi> upon him, in the Uſe of <hi>Means</hi> for <hi>Succeſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 7. What does our <hi>Author</hi> bring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Gideon</hi> for? Is it to prove what no Body denies, namely, the Almighty <hi>Power</hi> of God; the Neceſſity of entire <hi>Dependance</hi> on God, in the Uſe of <hi>Means;</hi> if ſo, it is impertinent to the Point in Debate, and unkind Dealing; for it inſinuates, that ſuch as are now for <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> queſtion the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and oppoſe an entire <hi>Dependance</hi> upon his <hi>Providence.</hi> This Inſinuation he farther manifeſts in the Cloſe of the aforeſaid Paragraph, in theſe Words, <q>Can ſuch a Dependance be leſs neceſſary in a Day of Goſpel-Light?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now that ſuch an Inſinuation is unreaſonable, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his own Conceſſion beforementioned, whereby he acknowledges a <hi>Permiſſion</hi> of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means (<hi>viz.</hi> of War) and yet that a ſtrong and entire Dependance upon God was at the ſame Time requir'd. Well, if both theſe Things were requir'd and conſiſtent then, why not now?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006247_0012_10281FFC853D6E40"/>Farther: That the aforeſaid Inſinuation is unjuſt, appears from the following Paragraph of the Sermon which he oppoſes, <hi>Page</hi> 39; <q>But, <hi>Sirs,</hi> allow me to obſerve, that tho' outward <hi>Means</hi> are neceſſary and excellent in their Place, yet they are not like to be crown'd with <hi>Succeſs,</hi> except we look above them to <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance;</hi> except we <hi>repent</hi> of our <hi>Sins,</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> our <hi>Lives!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But if our Author brings the Inſtance of <hi>Gideon</hi> to prove that the <hi>Mean</hi> of <hi>War</hi> is not at Times ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or requir'd by the <hi>Almighty,</hi> he contradicts what he acknowledges, and oppoſes the Inſtance he produces: For tho' <hi>Gideon,</hi> by God's Command, reduc'd his <hi>Army</hi> to a ſmall Number, yet i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And likewiſe he labour'd to alarm their <hi>Fear,</hi> by the ſounding of <hi>Trumpets,</hi> the Claſhing of <hi>Pitchers,</hi> the <hi>Blazing</hi> of <hi>Torches,</hi> and by the <hi>Shouts</hi> of his <hi>Soldiers, every one crying aloud, The Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 8. Why does our Author, in the Inſtance of <hi>Gideon,</hi> at firſt ſpeak of God's commanding and directing him, and his obeying; and yet a Line or two afterwards, when he comes to make mention of the Uſe of outward Means, Why does he change the Form of Expreſſion into the ſoft Word <hi>permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi> 'Tho' the Uſe of outward Means was <hi>permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>' Had he no Deſign in this?</p>
            <p>But I muſt haſten to the next Paragraph, which ſpeaks of God's prohibiting <hi>David</hi>'s building the <hi>Temple.</hi> For Anſwer to this Objection I refer the

Reader to two Sermons upon <hi>Exodus</hi> xv. 3. now in Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi>'s Preſs, and ſhall only add a little by Way of <hi>Reply,</hi> to two Particulars in the latter Part of the aforeſaid Paragraph, (V. P. 5,) where our Author,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt Enquires, in the following Words; <q>If a Ceſſation from War was neceſſary for the building that outward Temple, How much more ſo is it, for the Gathering of all Nations to be Members of the Church of Chriſt?</q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006247_0016_1028200C440CF4F0"/>Our Author obſerves upon the aforeſaid Words as follows, in his V. Page 6. <q>The only <hi>Mean</hi> here is <hi>War,</hi> and whether the Expreſſion ſuits with the Belief of an over-ruling, omnipreſent <hi>Providence,</hi> without whoſe Permiſſion no Evil can happen, and who alone hath the Controul of every Thing, I would have a little to be thought upon.</q>—</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that the Senſe our Author puts upon my Words (The only Mean) is forced, as may appear from the very Paragraph of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that immediately precedes what he has cited, (except one) in which I ſpeak thus: <q>
                  <hi>War</hi> is no doubt lawful, and conſequently approved by God, when undertaken by the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſome great <hi>Injury</hi> or Wrong, which much affects the <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> of a Nation or People, after all ſofter Means fail of Succeſs;</q>
               <hi>i. e.</hi> All human <hi>outward Means;</hi> this Senſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Sermon naturally leads to. Now, there being a Connection between this and the other Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, the Senſe of the Words (Only Mean) muſt be the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> The only <hi>human</hi> or outward <hi>Mean;</hi> it was about ſuch, and ſuch only, that I was reaſoning, and therefore it was a Force upon the Words to put that Senſe upon them, which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has done. This will appear more plainly from what I have ſaid in the Improvement of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (S. p. 39) where it was proper that I ſhould ſpeak of <hi>ſpiritual Means;</hi> the Words are theſe;</p>
            <p>
               <q>But Sirs allow me to obſerve, that tho' <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means</hi> are neceſſary and excellent in their Place, yet they are not like to be crowned with <hi>Succeſs,</hi> except we look above them to God for Direction and Aſſiſtance; except we repent of our Sins, and reform our Lives.</q> Here I plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between outward and ſpiritual Means, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert a Neceſſity of, and yet an Inſufficiency in both,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006247_0017_1028200DF2DDD9C0"/>
without the Concurrence of Providence, to anſwer the End deſign'd.</p>
            <p>Yet our Author is pleaſed to put a hard Senſe upon the Words aforeſaid, and thence takes Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to queſtion my Belief of an overruling, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Providence, and ſo gravely ſets about the Proof of it for my Conviction <note n="†" place="bottom">Calumniare fortiter, &amp; aliquid adherebit.</note>. O unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! This is the firſt time in my <hi>Life</hi> that I have been charged with <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> for he that denies a Providence, of Conſequence denies a <hi>God!</hi> He leaves out one Half of the Paragraph, and caſts Duſt upon me, in the Room of an Anſwer to the other. Now, whether ſuch a Method of managing Controverſy be a Sign of a good <hi>Cauſe,</hi> or of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did <hi>Conduct,</hi> I leave to the <hi>Reader</hi> to determine, and proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p>The next Objection, which is <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 8. Here our Author cites Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Annotations on <hi>Sam.</hi> xxx. 7. and labours to make that learned and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent Man's Writings ſerve a Purpoſe contrary to his profeſſed Sentiments, but in vain: All that can be reaſonably inferred from Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Gloſs is this. That it was their Duty under that Diſpenſation to conſult the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> upon the High-prieſt's <hi>Breaſtplate,</hi> for immediate Information and Direction in ſome difficult Caſes.</p>
            <p>Upon the aforeſaid Inſtance our Author ſpeaks thus, <hi>p.</hi> 8. <q>If then it had been an Error, not to have enquired of God, in ſo pinching a Caſe as this, the Conſequence fairly deducible is, That ſhould we be in the like Circumſtances, we muſt make the like Enquiry, and receive the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Command, otherwiſe <hi>David</hi>'s Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not be wholly followed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, That if we were under the ſame <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> the Conſequence would be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006247_0018_10282012593C9240"/>
juſt and fair, that in the ſame Circumſtances we ſhould make the like Enquiry; but otherwiſe the Conſequence is not fair; from different Premiſes the ſame Concluſion cannot flow, and ſo the Caſe is here.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> we have no temporal <hi>High-prieſt,</hi> with the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> upon his <hi>Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,</hi> from whom we may expect immediate and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racular Anſwers about Things to come; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not poſſible for us, in this State of Things, <hi>wholly to follow</hi> David's <hi>Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor have we any Neceſſity for, or Promiſe of immediate objective <hi>Revelation,</hi> in place of the <hi>Jewiſh Urim,</hi> in the ordinary Times of the Goſpel, from Chriſt our <hi>High-prieſt,</hi> in any Matters what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, whether temporal or ſpiritual, by <hi>Viſions, Voices,</hi> &amp;c. ſeeing <hi>the Prophecy is ſealed,</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of <hi>Scriptures</hi> is compleated, and <hi>able to make the Man of God perfect, and thoroughly furniſhed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is enough, that we have in place of the <hi>Urim</hi> a greater Meaſure of the Influences of the holy Spirit than the pious <hi>Jews</hi> ordinarily enjoyed, enlightening our Minds in the Uſe of appointed Means, to the right underſtanding of the Meaning of the holy Scriptures, and enabling us to believe their divine Authority; and ſo impreſſing the Truths contained in them upon our <hi>Hearts,</hi> as to transform them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the divine <hi>Image,</hi> and reform our Practice, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the divine <hi>Law:</hi> This I call <hi>ſubjective Revelation,</hi> which is neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Apoſtles were immediately inſpired, or had an <hi>objective,</hi> infallible <hi>Revelation</hi> of new <hi>Truths,</hi> in the ſame extraordinary Manner which the Prophets of old had; and it was neceſſary it ſhould be ſo in the Beginning of the Chriſtian <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> ſeeing they were to commit to Writing a <hi>Rule</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006247_0019_10282014111B0740"/>
the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages, which they could not do infallibly without immediate <hi>Revelation;</hi> and of this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Endowment</hi> they could give certain rational Evidences, by working real <hi>Miracles;</hi> without which, we have no Reaſon to believe the Claims of any thereto.</p>
            <p>But in the ordinary Times of the Goſpel, after the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of Religion were ſufficiently confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by miraculous Works, and the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> fully committed to Writing, there is no Need of extraordinary <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> or miraculous <hi>Works,</hi> the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the ſanctifying Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the bleſſed <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Diſpenſations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Providence,</hi> together with the ſober Uſe of our own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> are ſufficient to direct us in every Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we owe to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover it may be obſerved, that <hi>David</hi> did not in the aforeſaid Inſtance, conſult the <hi>Ephod,</hi> whether it was lawful to go to War in general, but whether it was expedient for him to purſue the <hi>Amalekites</hi> at that Time in particular, and what would be the <hi>Iſſue</hi> of it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxx. 8. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid enquired at the Lord, Shall I purſue after this Troop, ſhall I overtake them? and be anſwered him, purſue, for thou ſhalt overtake them, and without fail recover all;</hi> agreeable hereto is the Inſtance of <hi>Keilab,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiii. 9.—13. where <hi>David</hi> only conſults the <hi>Ephod</hi> concerning <hi>Events,</hi> and receives Anſwers accordingly.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing the <hi>Government</hi> of our <hi>Nation</hi> is no <hi>Theocracy</hi> (nor the Government of any other) as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> certainly was; if the Conductors of the <hi>State,</hi> muſt enter upon no Buſineſs of great <hi>Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and Moment, till they get an immediate Anſwer concerning the <hi>Event,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> did from the <hi>Urim,</hi> our national Affairs wou'd ſoon be embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006247_0020_1028201BDC089708"/>
in a Maze of inextricable Difficulty, and brought to Deſolation and <hi>Ruin!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Suppoſition that ſome did by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> really obtain a certain Knowledge of ſome future <hi>Events,</hi> and of the Expediency of Performing this or that <hi>Duty</hi> at ſuch a Time; yet if they cou'dn't prove the Reality of it to others, by miraculous Works, their bare Declaration cou'd give no reaſonable Satisfaction to others that wanted ſuch a Revelation, and ſo muſt needs fail of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of the Publick.</p>
            <p>Nor do we find that the <hi>Jews</hi> always conſulted the <hi>Urim,</hi> reſpecting every of their Battles; and we know not that <hi>Abraham</hi> had any to conſult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his famous Fight with <hi>Chederla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mer</hi>—Yet he was at no Loſs about his Duty, in that Affair, but directly obey'd the Call of Providence.</p>
            <p>Our Author ſilently paſſes over what I have ſaid in the 9 <hi>p.</hi> of the <hi>Ser.</hi> reſpecting the prudential Care that People take, in ſecuring of their temporal Goods; and the Advice of King <hi>Aſa</hi> to fortify their Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as the Inference drawn from it, of preſerving our Lives, which are a more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Depoſitum (<hi>S. p.</hi> 10) and proceeds to confute my Argument from the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which he has tho't proper not to mention, and only finds Fault with my ſaying, that it was from God; and then labours to remove the Force of the Argument, by a Diſtinction.</p>
            <p>Now in order to have a juſt View of this Matter, it will be neceſſary to cite my Argument and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and then propoſe a few Queries.</p>
            <p>The Argument in the Sermnon, is as follows (<hi>p.</hi> 10) <q>It is true, Man was originally created for the maintaining of Peace with his Fellows, and to this all the Laws of Nature, reſpecting others, have a primary Regard; yet when milder Meaſures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006247_0021_1028202101195F40"/>
ſcreen us from intollerable Injuries, the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> directs to fly to Force as the laſt Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the laſt Reſource; for the <hi>Obligation</hi> to the Offices of <hi>Peace</hi> is mutual, and binds all alike. Nature hath given no Man a Priviledge of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Laws at Pleaſure towards others, and yet obliged them to maintain the <hi>Peace</hi> towards him: No; the Duty being mutual, ſhould be mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed; and he that violates the Laws of Peace, and ſeeks another's Deſtruction, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to his own Wickedneſs, all the Miſery which another is neceſſitated in his own Defence, and in Purſuit of the Principle of it, to inflict upon him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author's Anſwer is expreſſed thus, <q>The firſt Proof propoſed in the Sermon, that War in the foregoing Inſtances is lawful, is from the Light of Nature; and I ſhould not have attack'd the Arguments drawn from thence, had not the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof aſked, <hi>"Who is the Author thereof but God himſelf?"</hi> The following Diſtinction ſeems therefore neceſſary to be made: God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man good, upright and holy, and had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this State, there never would have been <hi>any War, and conſequently no Need of Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:</hi> But Man falling, thro' Diſobedience, his Nature became corrupted, his Faculties depraved, and the whole intellectual Syſtem diſordered; thus began ſhedding of Blood, and the Earth was early filled with Violence. This was the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Conſequence of Sin. I hope this Writer will not venture to ſay, that God was the Author of Nature thus corrupted; the Nature, and the Light of Nature, that he was Author of, was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>perfect;</hi> but the Corruption in Nature, from whence proceeded Violence and Bloodſhed, was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of <hi>Satan.</hi>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006247_0022_102820229FC0BD08"/>To which I reply, as follows; Is it ſo, accord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to our Author's Acknowledgment, that had Man continued in his primitive, good, upright and holy State, there never would have been any <hi>War,</hi> and conſequently NO NEED OF SELF-DEFENCE; then it naturally follows, from his own Method of Reaſoning, that there is now Need of SELF-DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FENCE: Seeing, as he juſtly obſerves, Man is fallen and corrupted. By War, our Author ſeems here plainly to mean <hi>Offenſive War,</hi> and gives a brief, but ſubſtantial Hint of the Neceſſity of <hi>Self-defence</hi> (and conſequently of <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> which is the ſame) againſt it. This is wholſome Doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and the very Sum of all that I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for in the Sermon; the natural and eaſy Senſe of the Words aforeſaid, is this; If innocent Man had continued in his original Integrity, there would have been no Violence committed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no Need of Defence againſt it; but now Man is fallen, degenerate and corrupted, inclin'd to commit Acts of Violence, and to ſhed Blood, and therefore there is a Neceſſity of <hi>Self-defence,</hi> to ſcreen us from that Violence; and thus our Author indeed reaſons well in that Particular, but in the mean time gives up his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But this Conſequence he ſeems to oppoſe, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what confirms it, namely, That Violence proceeded from the Corruption of Nature, and was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan; very true, all unjuſt Violence, or <hi>Offenſive War</hi> (which is the ſame Thing in other Words) proceeds from thoſe criminal Cauſes, and therefore there is a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Self-defence,</hi> or of <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ſuppreſs that <hi>Violence,</hi> that Iniquity: Now inaſmuch as <hi>Self-defence</hi> does oppoſe and tends to ſubdue it, it muſt needs proceed from a contrary, and therefore a good Cauſe; unleſs our Author ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006247_0023_10282025C59B5D20"/>
that the ſame Cauſe will produce contrary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which is abſurd and impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Our Author is pleaſed to expreſs ſome Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, in the aforeſaid Paragraph, by ſaying that he hopes I will not venture to ſay, that God was the Author of Nature thus corrupted; after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging my Obligations to the Gentleman, for his charitable Sentime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts,</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, That Nature, and the Corruption of Nature, are two diſtinct and different Things; GOD is the Author of the former, but by no Means of the latter: By <hi>Nature</hi> I underſtand our very BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS; and by the Corruption of Nature, any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity to the moral Law of <hi>God,</hi> that cleaves to them in Man's fallen <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is likewiſe a great Difference between the Light of Nature, even in Man's fallen State, and the corrupt Inclinations of Nature; theſe often op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe each other in Things moral, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the ſame; this inward <hi>Conflict</hi> between <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Luſt,</hi> divers <hi>Pagans</hi> perceived and lamented<note n="§" place="bottom">Video meliora proboque, deteriora Sequer. Nitimur in veti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ſemper cupimuſque negatum.</note>! Hence I may ſay juſtly, that our Author didn't do well in blending th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe Things together, in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Paragraph, by which his unwary Reader is apt to be impoſed upon.</p>
            <p>But to make this Matter ſtill more plain, and eaſy to be underſtood, let it be obſerved, that I ſhewed in the Sermon what I meant by the Law of Nature (which this Gentleman has taken no Notice of) namely, ſomething that was ſubſtantially the ſame with the Moral Law, <hi>p.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed GOD when he made Man, to impreſs upon his Mind, a Knowledge of the <hi>Offices</hi> which it was proper for him to perform towards GOD, his <hi>Neighbour</hi> and <hi>himſelf;</hi> this Knowledge was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006247_0024_102820299A4DFE58"/>
impair'd by Man's Apoſtacy, yet there are ſtill ſuch Remains of it in the human Mind, as ſhew (if ſuitably attended to and improved) the principal moral Duties required of us; this I conceive the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 14, 15. <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the Things contained in the Law (i. e.</hi> the moral Law revealed in the Scriptures) <hi>were a Law unto themſelves, which ſhew the Work of the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their Hearts,</hi> or ſome remaining Notices of it engraven upon their rational Nature; <hi>Their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences bearing Witneſs, and their Thoughts the mean while accuſing or excuſing one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now tho' this Light of Nature be in a fallen corrupted Creature, yet it came originally from GOD, who is <hi>the Author of every good Gift;</hi> and hence <hi>Solomon</hi> calls the <hi>Spirit of Man the Candle of the Lord:</hi> It is true it is leſs in Degree and Influence than that which <hi>Adam</hi> enjoyed, yet it is and muſt be of the ſame Kind, inaſmuch as it oppoſes the ſame moral Evils, and directs to the ſame moral Good, as far as it reaches.</p>
            <p>It is called the Light and Law of Nature in a good Senſe (which the Word Nature is capable of, as well as a bad) becauſe the firſt Man received it together with his Nature or Being in Perfection, and we the <hi>Remains</hi> of it with ours. This Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Scripture before mentioned confirms; <hi>The Gentiles did by Nature (i. e.</hi> not by the Inclinations of Nature, which, at leaſt, generally tend to Evil, but by the Light of Nature which directs to and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of moral Good<note n="§" place="bottom">

The Gods never make any Laws that are unjuſt; on the contrary, other Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators, can ſcarce make any that are juſt.</q>

            <p>What tho' ſhedding of Blood and Violence in <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> be the unhappy Conſequence of Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> There would have been no need thereof if Man had not ſinned, yet it will not follow, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor imagines, that it is therefore ſinful; then by the ſame Way of Reaſoning, human Laws, and Phyſick, and ſhedding the Blood of Criminals by the Magiſtrate are <hi>ſinful,</hi> and ſhould be carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which is falſe and abſurd! Our Author's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument concludes too much, and therefore nothing at all to his Purpoſe: All thoſe Particulars but now mentioned, tho' they be the Conſequences of the <hi>Sin</hi> of Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> they wou'dn't have been neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if Man had not <hi>ſinned;</hi> yet they are not the

proper Effects of Sin; it is not <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> and right <hi>Reaſon</hi> that direct to the regular Uſe of them; and therefore inaſmuch as the Fall of Man renders them neceſſary, it is an Argument for, and not againſt them.</p>
            <p>The Light of Nature directs to <hi>Health</hi> in the firſt Place, by the Uſe of all proper Means, and chuſes it as the moſt agreeable State; but in Caſe of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, preſcribes the Uſe of Phyſick, tho' diſagreeable to our Inclinations, becauſe medicinal and neceſſary for the Recovery of our <hi>Health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, undoubtedly, the ſame Light and Law of Nature directs to purſue Peace with our <hi>Neighbours</hi> in the firſt Place, and chuſes it as the moſt deſirable Condition; but when this is loſt, thro' the <hi>Injuſtice</hi> of others, in important <hi>Inſtances,</hi> and cannot be recovered by gentle <hi>Methods,</hi> the Light of Nature directs to the Uſe of Force to obtain it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Civil Law, or by <hi>Self-defence,</hi> and <hi>War</hi> as the laſt <hi>Remedy,</hi> which we are drove to with <hi>Reluctance,</hi> and by extream <hi>Neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, our <hi>Author</hi> obſerves in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Paragraph, <q>That the Light of Nature which God was the Author of, was <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>innocent:</hi>
               </q> Which implies, that the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in Man's fallen State, is ſinful and guilty; and this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in the following Words; <q>For it is not from the <hi>degenerate fallen Light of Nature,</hi> that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be drawn, for the Formation of Chriſtian Principles, neither are any from it of any Weight in Oppoſition thereto.</q>

and deliberately killing himſelf: So that the Caſe in the Sermon does not reach this Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs we can ſuppoſe, he who does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to defend himſelf, is unactive from a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deliberate Deſire of being killed.

            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, as follows, namely, That theſe <hi>Arguments,</hi> in my Opinion, ſupport the Charge in the preceding Paragraph:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to ſeek the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. The reaſonable <hi>Self-love</hi> that is recommended in the divine Oracles.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The natural <hi>Deſire</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> implanted in the <hi>human Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe our Author acknowledges by his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and only offers three Exceptions againſt the Conſequence I draw from them. The</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of which is a <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, I ſuppoſe, from ſome <hi>Law Book;</hi> which is this, <q>A Self-murderer, is he that commits Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, by willingly and deliberately killing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That our Author by his own <hi>Pen</hi> proves the <hi>Charge;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Definition</hi> he offers of <hi>Self-murder,</hi> is applicable in ſome Degree to the <hi>Neglecters</hi> of <hi>Self-Defence: For,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In Purſuance of this <hi>Principle,</hi> they are here ſuppoſed to neglect that <hi>Mean</hi> willingly, when the Uſe of it is neceſſary and ſeaſonable.</p>

            <p n="5">5. That he who ſuffers ſuch, whom he has Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude have a murderous Intention to aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinate him, and conſequently without <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> to kill him, may be ſaid <hi>interpretatively</hi> to conſent to their murderous <hi>Deſign;</hi> becauſe he oppoſes not, by all proper <hi>Means</hi> in his <hi>Power,</hi> the Execution of it. But to proceed:</p>
            <p>The ſecond Exception of our <hi>Author</hi> againſt the Charge aforeſaid, is his Reaſoning from the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Murder already mentioned, in the following Manner, <hi>namely,</hi>
               <q>That the Caſe in the Sermon does not reach the aforeſaid Deſcription, unleſs we can ſuppoſe, he who does not endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, is unactive, from a wilful and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Deſire of being killed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That he who willingly and deliberately uſes a <hi>Mean,</hi> and that from a fixed <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> that has a natural Aptneſs to anſwer a certain <hi>End,</hi> does at leaſt <hi>virtually</hi> aim at the <hi>End</hi> to which the Mean tends, and ſo is chargeable with the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, whether he actually aims at the End or not; becauſe he is a <hi>rational Creature,</hi> who ought to act with <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Deſign.</hi> If he doesn't actually aim at the <hi>End,</hi> to which the <hi>Mean</hi> he uſes has a natural Fitneſs, it argues Weakneſs of <hi>Mind,</hi> to chooſe <hi>Means</hi> that verge to an End he diſlikes: However, if the aforeſaid Perſon doesn't aim at his own <hi>Death</hi> actually, notwithſtanding of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Inconſiſtency that attend his <hi>Conduct,</hi> yet the <hi>Malignity</hi> of the <hi>Crime</hi> is no doubt leſſened in <hi>Degree,</hi> becauſe that lies much in Intention. In the mean time, as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> informs us, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006247_0035_1028204E246CDFF8"/>
beareth the Sound of the Trumpet, and taketh not Warning, if the Sword come and take him away, his Blood ſhall be upon his own Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſing a pious Perſon abſtains totally from <hi>Food,</hi> with a religious Deſign, to be conformed to the <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Faſting,</hi> and preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expecting to be miraculouſly ſupported without <hi>Food</hi> for Forty Days, dies in that Space, woudn't he be guilty of <hi>Self-murder</hi> in ſome Degree, tho' his Crime is not ſo heinous and aggravated, as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his own <hi>Death?</hi> But I proceed to the third Exception, which is this: <q>It is without doubt, ſays our <hi>Author,</hi> every Man's <hi>Duty</hi> to uſe proper <hi>Means</hi> for the Preſervation of <hi>Life;</hi> but if any Man thinks that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath forbidden him the Uſe of <hi>military Preparations,</hi> and yet will uſe them, they are to him very improper <hi>Means.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here obſerve, that in the aforeſaid Paragraph our <hi>Author tacitly</hi> acknowledges the Lawfulneſs of <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Preparations</hi> in themſelves, as <hi>Means</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Life; and that it is every Man's Duty to uſe them, who reckons them lawful; which is indeed a giving up of his whole <hi>Cauſe.</hi> Great is the Power of <hi>Truth</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Magna eſt veritas, &amp; prevalebit.</note>. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. He concludes, <q>That any One who is convinced that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath forbidden him the Uſe of military <hi>Preparations,</hi> they are to him improper Means.</q> It is very true, they are ſo, at that Time, till he is better inſtructed; for doubtleſs it is a Sin to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and therefore it is a neceſſary <hi>Duty,</hi> in ſuch a Caſe, to uſe with Speed and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, all proper <hi>Means</hi> to obtain <hi>Light</hi> from <hi>God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi>'s citing <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 26. and <hi>Poole</hi>'s Annotations upon the Place, to prove that we <q>Shou'dn't act contrary to <hi>Conſcience,</hi> in order to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006247_0036_1028204FC385EE88"/>
eſcape <hi>Sufferings</hi> upon a <hi>religious Account,</hi>
               </q> is quite foreign to the <hi>Point</hi> in <hi>Queſtion,</hi> which is ſtrictly and properly a <hi>civil</hi> and not a <hi>religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> Who denies that we ſhou'dn't ſuffer patiently upon the <hi>Score</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> when called thereto by divine <hi>Providence?</hi> If the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> under which we live, ſhou'd <hi>perſecute</hi> us, becauſe of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> no doubt we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it with Calmneſs and Meekneſs; but this is very different from our being <hi>paſſive</hi> under the <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> of a foreign <hi>Foe,</hi> who comes to <hi>rob</hi> us of our <hi>Goods,</hi> and therefore jumbling thoſe Things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that are ſo very different, ſerves only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the unwary <hi>Reader!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our <hi>Author</hi>'s following Paragraph, is very unjuſtifiable, namely this, <q>That if any ſincere Chriſtian underſtands it to be his <hi>Duty,</hi> not to make any <hi>Defence</hi> at all, his forbearing to uſe any, will never incur Guilt.</q>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Tho' <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Evil</hi> of any <hi>Crime,</hi> and a falſe <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> conſequent upon it, do, if the <hi>Ignorance</hi> is not <hi>affected</hi> and wilful, leſſen its <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity,</hi> yet they cannot totally remove it.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> are the ſupream <hi>Rule,</hi> which we are bound to ſearch and underſtand, eſpecially in Things of great Moment, and to which we ought to be conformed, both in <hi>Sentiment</hi> and <hi>Practice, Iſa.</hi> viii. 20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 16, 17. and <hi>Conſcience</hi> is but a ſubordinate or <hi>ruled Rule; For God is greater than our Conſcience, and knoweth all Things,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Things of a <hi>moral Nature,</hi> are either good or
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006247_0037_10282052D4F3FBB0"/>
bad in themſelves, antecedent to, or before our Tho'ts about them; nor can our Opinion alter their <hi>Nature.</hi> If our <hi>Ignorance</hi> or wrong <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> do juſtify wholly a continued <hi>Neglect</hi> of <hi>Duty,</hi> or <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Omiſſion;</hi> by a Parity of Reaſon, they may juſtify a <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Commiſſion;</hi> and if one, why not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? And conſequently the Guilt of all Crimes, yea the greateſt, will be removed by what is criminal, which is very abſurd!</p>
            <p>This Notion will juſtify <hi>Saul</hi>'s perſecuting the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from <hi>City</hi> to <hi>City,</hi> even unto <hi>Death! For he verily tho't with himſelf, that he ought to do many Things contrary to the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of Nazareth, Acts</hi> xxvi. 9. which is very ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!</p>
            <p>This Notion likewiſe juſtifies all the <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> or <hi>Sufferings</hi> upon a <hi>religious Account,</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have endured, at any Time or Place, ſince they have appeared in the World; in caſe that thoſe who oppreſſed them, tho't it their <hi>Duty</hi> ſo to do, which Charity obliges us to hope they did, at leaſt ſome of them.</p>
            <p>Now why does our Author appear as an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> for the <hi>Quakers</hi> unattack'd, and yet in the mean Time, hold a <hi>Principle,</hi> that in its natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, juſtifies all their unreaſonable Sufferings? Is this rational? Is this conſiſtent?</p>
            <p>Our Author takes Notice of another Paſſage in the Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>viz.</hi> this, <q>Well, if <hi>Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> be a heinous Sin, it will follow by the Law of Contraries, that Self-defence is an important Duty: Surely he who is unjuſtly attacked, and does not endeavour by ſuitable Means to preſerve his Life, eſpecially if there be any probability of Succeſs, in ſo doing betrays it, and ſo is guilty of <hi>Suicide;</hi> a Crime of the firſt Magnitude and deepeſt Dye!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Upon this Paſſage (faith our Author) I would
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006247_0038_10282055DB9CC190"/>
remark, that frequently the moſt ſuitable Means to preſerve Life, when attacked, is to deliver up that for which the Attack is made.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. Sometimes the <hi>Attack</hi> is with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Deſign to <hi>murder:</hi> and then if that be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up, for which the Attack is made, the <hi>Life</hi> itſelf muſt be given up.</p>

            <p>But our Author proceeds to ſay, <q>If however I were thus attacked by <hi>Villains,</hi> who were ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to determine to take away my <hi>Life,</hi> were I in the meek and peaceable Diſpoſition, which the Goſpel inculcates, I believe that would have ſuch an Effect upon the worſt of Men, that it would diſarm their Malice; but if it did not, my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting calmly, and reſigning my Life, rather than running the Riſque of taking away another's, would be ſo far from <hi>Suicide,</hi> that it would be acting agreeable to the Nature and Temper of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and conſequently <hi>highly rewardable.</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">What our Author Means by <hi>highly rewardable,</hi> I don't certainly know; I would hope that he is not for the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine of the Merit of good Works, I acknowledge that the Doctrine of abſolute <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> deſerves a Reward, but of a different Kind from what he, I ſuppoſe, intends.</note>

            <p>To which I reply, that there are theſe <hi>Defects</hi> in the aforeſaid Paragraph, which render it inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, <hi>viz.</hi>

Neglect of <hi>Self-defence</hi> upon a proper Occaſion, is agreeable to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4.

            <p>To what has been ſaid, I ſhall only add, That our Author, in his <hi>Gloſs</hi> aforeſaid, has been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, or rather happy, in his Manner of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as to give up the <hi>Cauſe</hi> for which he contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for by his <hi>Pen</hi> he has acknowledged the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of <hi>Self-defence,</hi> in theſe Words, (<hi>V. p.</hi> 14) '<hi>Whilſt the Owner of the Houſe was making a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary 'Defence:</hi> Sound Doctrine indeed; <hi>Truth</hi> will out ſometimes: Now if the <hi>Gentleman</hi> wou'd but ſtand by this, our Controverſy would ſoon come to a comfortable Period; which I am not without Hopes it will.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Our Author anſwers, <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 14. <q>That we have no Account of the Diſciples ever uſing <hi>Swords</hi> after Chriſt's Aſcenſion; and we have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral very ſtrong Intimations that they did not, which ſufficiently demonſtrates that they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Text</hi> in its preſent literal Acceptation.</q>
            </p>

               <q>It is probable at leaſt, ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> that ſome of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> wore <hi>Swords</hi> in travelling, in the Sight, and with the Knowledge of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> during the whole Time they accompanied him; which <hi>Joſephus</hi> informs us, other <hi>Galileans</hi> alſo did, in their <hi>Journey</hi> from their own Country to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the Roads being much infeſted with <hi>Highwaymen</hi>) and who alſo tells us the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>. Hence it came to paſs, that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> told his Diſciples, ſuch a Time was at hand, <hi>That they ſhould ſell even their Garments, to buy Swords,</hi> the Apoſtles preſently anſwered, That there were two <hi>Swords</hi> in their Company, and in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany there were none but the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </q> They un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their Maſter as ſpeaking of <hi>temporal Swords,</hi> and he did not reprove them. Perhaps it may be

ſuggeſted, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſaying, it was enough, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a <hi>Reproof;</hi> I anſwer, no, not at all; for two Swords were enough for that little Company for the preſent to guard them from the <hi>Robbers,</hi> while they kept together; but when they parted, and travell'd two and two in Company, it was but proper they ſhould have more.</p>
            <p>As to the Gloſs of thoſe Gentlemen (who carried on the Annotations begun by Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>) which is mentioned by our <hi>Author,</hi> tho' they are inclined to take the Paſſage in a ſpiritual Senſe, yet they ſignify that others were of another Mind, and only ſay, that it was difficult to reconcile their Senſe of the Words to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Practice, and to the laſt Words of our Saviour, <hi>It is enough:</hi> But they don't ſay it is <hi>impoſſible;</hi> and if they had, they would have been very much miſtaken. For my part, I can't but think a much greater <hi>Difficulty</hi> attends their Senſe of the Words. Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis</hi> upon the Place ſpeaks thus: <q>He does not ſo much exhort them to oppoſe Force by Force, as from a Foreſight of the Enmity they were to be expoſed to, to repreſs their private Animoſities or Reſentments <note n="*" place="bottom">Non tam bortatur eos, ut vim vi repellant, quam ut appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſione communis contra ipſos inimicitiae, propriam inter ſe animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem reprimant.</note>:</q> This includes the Senſe I have been pleading for.</p>
            <p>But famous GROTIUS is ſtill more expreſs, and takes the Words abſolutely in their plain literal Senſe; <q>Let him, ſaith he, by all Means get a <hi>Sword;</hi> if it cannot be had otherwiſe, even by the <hi>Sale</hi> of his <hi>Garment;</hi> whoever has a <hi>Purſe,</hi> let him take it, with the <hi>Scrip,</hi> and whoever has no Sword, let him rather ſell his <hi>Coat</hi> than want One; for this is the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of Mankind, when <hi>Violence</hi> is fear'd <note n="†" place="bottom">Omnino gladium ſibi comparet, veſte divendita, ſi aliter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parere non poteſt, quiſquis crum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1. Is it not moſt ſafe to take Places of Scripture in their literal Senſe, when it involves no Abſurdity, and is not contrary to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of <hi>Faith?</hi>
            </p>

But now he that hath a Purſe, let him take it; and likewiſe his Scrip, and he that hath no Sword, let him ſell his Garment, and buy One.</hi> If the <hi>Sword</hi> be taken in a ſpiritual Senſe in the latter, why not the <hi>Purſe</hi> and <hi>Scrip</hi> in the former?

                  <hi>War</hi> was lawful under the <hi>Old Teſtament Diſpenſation,</hi> and therefore is lawful under the <hi>New.</hi>

               <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>I anſwer; If our Author had not dealt unfairly with my Paragraph, in breaking the Connection of the <hi>Jewiſh Diſpenſation</hi> and <hi>moral Law</hi> apparent in it, which I formed with <hi>Deſign,</hi> and ſo put a Senſe upon it contrary to what he might ſee was my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the next Page, where I expreſs the <hi>Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> I had in View in writing the aforeſaid Words; <hi>namely</hi> this, <hi>in Things of a moral Nature:</hi> I ſay, if he had taken notice of that, it would have ſpoiled his vain <hi>Triumph</hi> about <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> next proceeds to animadvert upon my <hi>Argument</hi> from the ſixth <hi>Command,</hi> S. p. 14. which is this: <q>The <hi>ſixth Commandment</hi> does undoubtedly imply a lawful <hi>War;</hi> for if we muſt not kill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, much leſs ourſelves; and if we muſt have no Hand in our own <hi>Death,</hi> we muſt defend our Lives againſt <hi>Violence,</hi> which ſometimes cannot be done without <hi>War.</hi> Now, the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> never came to deſtroy the <hi>moral Law,</hi> or the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which is in Subſtance the ſame, but to fulfil it: <hi>Do we make void the Law by Faith</hi> (or by the Doctrines of the Goſpel) ſays the Apoſtle?

No! Well, ſeeing he grants the <hi>Premiſſes,</hi> from which I argue, and offers nothing in particular againſt the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the <hi>Conſequence,</hi> it will hold good, he cannot avoid it. If the aforeſaid <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> be not plain and ſelf-evident, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences or Deductions from them juſt and clear, I know not what is.</p>
            <p>Well, but our Author doesn't like it: Why ſo? Hear his own Words, <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There are ſuch ſtrange <hi>Abſurdities</hi> in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>declaiming,</hi> and drawing Concluſions, a Man muſt be very blind that cannot ſee them. A poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Precept</hi> is made to imply its direct <hi>Reverſe:</hi> A Commandment not to kill, is implied to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize Killing: And in Conſequence thereof the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſuppoſed to approve of <hi>War.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be agreeable to his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Doctrines,</hi> the Reader is deſired to conſult.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply as follows, Stay, <hi>Sir,</hi> and cool a little; why ſo haſty? why ſo hot? Take care that the Charge of <hi>declaiming</hi> does not turn upon your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which it will do unavoidably, if you don't give good Reaſon for your Cenſure.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore examine the Strength of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Reaſonings againſt the Conſequence aforeſaid. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſays, <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 16. 'A <hi>poſitive Precept</hi> is made to imply its direct <hi>Reverſe.</hi>'</p>
            <p>I anſwer no, not at all, unleſs it be in <hi>Sound,</hi> not in <hi>Subſtance</hi> or <hi>Reality:</hi> 'Tis true, it forbids the killing of any unjuſtly, and yet at the ſame time <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins,</hi> or allows of the juſt killing of <hi>Criminals</hi> by the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> but inaſmuch as this <hi>killing</hi> and not <hi>killing</hi> reſpect different <hi>Perſons,</hi> and contrary <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> it implies no Contradiction.

GREAT GUN upon himſelf, not to hurt him, but to convince him of his Miſtake, and ſee how he will like it. <q>There are ſuch ſtrange Abſurdities in this Manner of declaiming, and drawing Concluſions, a Man muſt be very blind that cannot ſee them.</q>
               <hi>E. G.</hi> The ſixth Command, with its Threatening, according to our Author's Judgment, is thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> but if thou doſt, thou ſhalt be <hi>killed</hi> by the Hand of the Magiſtrate (if he does not deny all civil Government, he muſt own this) then the Conſequence comes upon himſelf; he makes <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precept</hi> to imply its direct <hi>Reverſe;</hi> in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment not to <hi>kill,</hi> he imagines that an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of killing is implied; I leave it to our Author's <hi>Prudence</hi> to clear himſelf in what Way he ſees beſt.</p>
            <p>As to his Query afterwards, <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 16. <q>And in Conſequence thereof the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to approve of War. Whether this be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Doctrines,</hi> the Reader is deſired to conſult.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, The bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and confirmed the <hi>moral Law;</hi> this he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf informs us, <hi>He came not to deſtroy, but to fulfil;</hi> he likewiſe ſolemnly aſſures us, <hi>That till Heaven and Earth paſs, one Jot, or one Title, ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law—and that whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of the leaſt Commandments, and ſhall teach Men ſo, he ſhall be called the</hi> LEAST <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. v. Now, was not the <hi>Life</hi> of Chriſt agreeable to his <hi>Doctrine?</hi> Yes ſurely.</p>
            <p>If our <hi>Author</hi> doesn't like this Anſwer, he muſt chuſe one for himſelf; for the aforeſaid Query con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him in Effect as much as me.</p>
            <p>I may likewiſe for the ſake of Brevity, leave his other following Query to himſelf to Anſwer, in a Conſiſtency with his Doctrine of <hi>killing Criminals</hi> by
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006247_0050_1028207EEEBD2238"/>
the Magiſtrate, or his Order, which is the ſame Thing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Where there is one (ſaith our Author, <hi>V. p.</hi> 16) who take it in its firſt Senſe (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Sixth Command as forbidding War) ſlain, are there not many Thouſands of the latter killed in the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Fighting?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, It may be ſo; but in the mean Time, if thoſe that hold the Doctrine of abſolute Non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, are not ſlain, they have Reaſon to thank thoſe under GOD for their <hi>Protection,</hi> who hold <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> and therefore ſhou'dn't ſlight them, and condemn them upon that Account!</p>
            <p>Farther, if our <hi>Author's</hi> Obſervation be juſt, as it probably is, then the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of abſolute <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> is a <hi>Fleſh-pleaſing</hi> Doctrine; ſeeing that it tends to ſave the <hi>Caſh,</hi> and (in ſome Senſe) to protect the <hi>Buff,</hi> tho' ingloriouſly; I confeſs it paſſes my Underſtanding to perceive much <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> and <hi>Self-denial</hi> in ſuch Matters; but I leave it to every one to judge for himſelf; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>Our Author complains of my Explication of <hi>Prov.</hi> xxii. 3. in his <hi>V. p.</hi> 16. and obſerves, <q>That I make hiding one's ſelf, and preparing for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſo exactly alike, that they are taken the one for the other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, They are, in my Opinion, alike; for he that rightly prepares for <hi>Defence,</hi> provides a <hi>Hiding-place</hi> from the Enemy, a <hi>Fort</hi> and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>War,</hi> to ſcreen him from their <hi>Vengeance;</hi> and are not theſe Things the Intention of a <hi>Hiding-place,</hi> viz. to <hi>conceal</hi> and <hi>protect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I may enquire how can a prudent Man, who, according to the common Courſe of Things, foreſees temporal Danger and Calamity approaching,

            <p>But our Author proceeds to mention the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paragraph of my Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now if the Almighty has approved of War formerly, and there is ſtill the ſame Neceſſity of it, under the Goſpel-Diſpenſation as before, it will follow, that it is equally lawful now: It is abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the bleſſed God, who is infinite in Wiſdom, and unalterable in his Nature, would determine contrarily at different Periods of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006247_0052_1028208785831E18"/>
Time, concerning a Caſe that is ſubſtantially the ſame!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which our Author remarks as follows, <q>If this Manner of Arguing proves any Thing, it proves Offenſive War, as lawful as De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ive. God approved of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> taking away the Poſſeſſions of many Nations: He commanded them to deſtroy ſome utterly; is it therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually lawful to do ſo now, whether we have this Command or not?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, That Almighty GOD never commanded <hi>Offenſive War</hi> (properly and ſtrictly ſo called) Perhaps this may be reckoned by ſome a <hi>Paradox;</hi> but I think it is a plain Truth; the aforeſaid Inſtances are not <hi>Offenſive War,</hi> which is the unjuſt <hi>Invaſion</hi> of another's <hi>Right;</hi> for the bleſſed God, who is the abſolute and original <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor</hi> of all, transferred the civil <hi>Right</hi> of thoſe Nations, which they forfeited by Sin, to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> previous to, or before their taking Poſſeſſion thereof; and, as abſolute <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and a righteous <hi>Governor</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> gave his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Commiſſion to puniſh them, and put them to Death. In the former Inſtance, they did but take forcible Poſſeſſion of their own Country and Goods; and in the latter, they were but <hi>Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of <hi>judicial Puniſhment</hi> under a proper <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and therefore there was nothing of <hi>Offenſive War</hi> in thoſe Things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Almighty</hi> never did, nor, to ſpeak with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, ever can, in a Conſiſtency with the <hi>Purity</hi> and Perfection of his <hi>Nature,</hi> enjoin ſuch a <hi>wicked</hi> and abominable Thing as <hi>Offenſive War!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true the Manner of conveying the aforeſaid <hi>civil Right,</hi> and <hi>penal Authority,</hi> was extraordinary and immediate, peculiarly ſuited to that Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006247_0053_1028208D1834F9C8"/>
which was a <hi>Theocracy, God</hi> himſelf being their <hi>King,</hi> in an extraordinary and immediate Way; a Priviledge which no other Nation ever had, or, ſo far as we know, are like to have.</p>
            <p>And therefore not only <hi>civil Rights,</hi> and <hi>judicial Power</hi> and Authority, are conveyed always <hi>mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to other Nations, by ordinary human <hi>Means,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different <hi>Laws,</hi> Conſtitutions and Cuſtoms of Countries; but alſo the claiming the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Rights,</hi> and exerciſing the aforeſaid <hi>Authority,</hi> muſt be <hi>mediate</hi> alſo, regulated by human <hi>Reaſon,</hi> agreeable to the <hi>Laws</hi> of different <hi>States</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence if the <hi>Almighty</hi> ſhould in an extraordinary and immediate Manner, give to any a <hi>Right</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> there wou'd be Need of infallible and immediate <hi>Revelation,</hi> to aſſure us of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nor could we ſafely act before it, in either of of the above Inſtances.</p>
            <p>But there is no Need of immediate Revelation, to inform or aſſure us of theſe <hi>civil Rights,</hi> or <hi>civil Authority,</hi> which are convey'd to us in an ordinary <hi>Channel,</hi> we are apt to know them full well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
            <p>Nor need we any new <hi>Revelation</hi> to inform us of a <hi>Truth</hi> that is engraven with indelible Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon our rational Natures, as with the Point of a <hi>Diamond,</hi> and written with a <hi>Sun-beam</hi> upon a great Variety of Pages in the ſacred Volume; namely, That we ſhould <hi>defend</hi> ourſelves and <hi>Properties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do we need a new <hi>Revelation</hi> to inſtruct us, when to prepare for, and endeavour the aforeſaid <hi>Defence,</hi> the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> together with our own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> will eaſily, when attended to, point out the <hi>Time,</hi> as they do in other temporal Caſes.</p>
            <p>As to our <hi>Author</hi>'s hard Conſtruction upon theſe Words, '<hi>Only Barrier,</hi>' in my Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>V.

               </gap>e; the Sentence in the original Manuſcript runs thus; 'Which is <hi>ſometimes</hi> the <hi>only Barrier;</hi>' but if the aforeſaid Word hadn't been corrected, our Author might eaſily know, from the <hi>Series</hi> of the <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> my Meaning to be only this, That ſometimes <hi>Self-defence</hi> is the only human or outward <hi>Barrier</hi> againſt <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Violence;</hi> now ſeeing the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> oblig'd him to put the moſt favourable Senſe upon the Words that they can in Reaſon bear, I leave it to the Reader to judge, whether ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement be a Commendation of our Author's Cauſe or Candour.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; my <hi>Opponent</hi> mentions another Paragraph of the Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 15. <hi>Vin. p.</hi> 18. which is this;</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is ſtrange to think, and hard to reconcile it with any juſt Notion of divine Goodneſs, that Almighty God, ſhou'd under this laſt and brighteſt Diſpenſation of his Grace towards the Children of Men, inſtead of enlarging diminiſh our <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and that in ſo tender and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Point! Indeed, methinks ſuch a Notion tends to caſt a diſhonourable and inglorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the divine Benignity and Goodneſs; and the moſt illuſtrious Diſplay of it, that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given to the Children of Men, by the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which he remarks as follows; <hi>V. p.</hi> 18. <q>What Priviledges are here meant, thoſe of <hi>Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for our Poſſeſſions, <hi>gaining Riches,</hi> enjoying Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho' Riches acquired by honeſt Means, may not be inconſiſtent with the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Chriſt; and tho' we may poſſeſs in the

World many near and dear Enjoyments, yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Teſtimony</hi> ought to be <hi>preferred</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Things, if we would render ourſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in his Sight, <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 26.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that there are theſe following <hi>Blemiſhes</hi> in the aforeſaid <hi>Paragraph,</hi> as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Miſrepreſentation</hi> of the <hi>Point</hi> in <hi>Debate;</hi> here it is hinted as if what I was contending for, was, in Part, <hi>gaining Riches,</hi> which implies an <hi>Offenſive War;</hi> now this was expreſly guarded againſt, in ſtating the Queſtion in the Beginning of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in the Negative there mentioned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>begging</hi> the <hi>Queſtion</hi> in <hi>Controverſy,</hi> which ſhou'd be proved; for he here takes that for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which I deny; namely, That the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>abſolute Non-reſiſtance,</hi> is the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and then reaſons upon it, to the Terror of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which is very unfair.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the <hi>Application</hi> of <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 26. to his Purpoſe, he makes the Doctrine of <hi>abſolute Non-reſiſtance,</hi> or the <hi>Neglect</hi> of one outward <hi>Mean</hi> for <hi>Self-defence,</hi> one <hi>Term</hi> of Chriſtianity; inſinuating, that one can't be a Diſciple of Chriſt without it, or true Chriſtians, and reſign'd to the Will of God, which is very uncharitable!</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p>Upon which our Author remarks in the following Manner, <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The firſt of theſe Queſtions I really think not applicable to the Point in Diſpute; becauſe there is not any Part of the <hi>moral Law</hi> which <hi>enjoins War:</hi> And the Reaſon why <hi>Meroz</hi> was ſo ſeverely <hi>curſed, Poole</hi> ſays, was to ſhew the Sinfulneſs and Unreaſonableneſs of their cowardly Deſertion of this Cauſe, becauſe it was the Cauſe of God; and they had the Call of God to it, whom they knew to be able eaſily to cruſh that Enemy whom they dreaded, and who had promiſed to do it: So that upon this View of the Caſe, there is this only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Parallel,</hi> That it is a <hi>Sin to neglect going to War in the Cauſe of God, when he calls to it:</hi> This, therefore, cannot at all operate againſt thoſe who refuſe Fighting, becauſe they apprehend God hath forbidden it.</q>

            <p>To which I reply, by offering the following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our <hi>Author begs the Queſtion</hi> in <hi>Debate; namely,</hi> That not any Part of the <hi>moral Law</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins <hi>War.</hi> Whether a <hi>Defenſive War</hi> be not implied

in, and conſequently enjoined by the <hi>ſixth Command,</hi> I leave to the Reader to determine, after a View of the Reaſonings I have before offered upon that Head, together with what is ſaid in the Sermon to the ſame Purpoſe upon the fifth Command, p. 15, 16, 17, which our Author has thought proper not to meddle with, for what Reaſons he knows beſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My <hi>Opponent,</hi> in the aforeſaid Paragraph, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as I conceive, gives up the <hi>Cauſe</hi> for which he contends; for he acknowledges that this is proved by the <hi>Parallel</hi> of <hi>Meroz,</hi> namely, <q>That it is a Sin to neglect going to War in the Cauſe of God, when he calls to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And only endeavours to ſcreen himſelf from the Conſequence of the aforeſaid Conceſſion, by this ſlender Pretext, <hi>namely,</hi>
               <q>This cannot at all operate againſt thoſe that refuſe fighting, becauſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God hath forbidden it.</q> This Argument I have before conſidered—to which I refer the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſhall only add a few Words, together with the Sentiment of <hi>Grotius</hi> upon this Head.</p>
            <p>The aforeſaid Pretext or Apology, directly tends, ſo far as I can ſee, intirely to overthrow all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick or <hi>inward Goodneſs</hi> or <hi>Badneſs</hi> of <hi>human Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and conſequently to make both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> a mere <hi>Noſe</hi> of <hi>Wax!</hi>

            <p n="3">3. From Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Annotations upon the Caſe of <hi>Meroz,</hi> which I had not cited in my Sermon, nor don't remember I had read, our Author is pleaſed to take Occaſion to reflect under the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 20. upon many of the <hi>People</hi> of my <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> as <hi>cowardly,</hi>
               <q>when many of the ſame <hi>Profeſſion</hi> with this <hi>Sermon-writer</hi> hid themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that it ſeems ſomething ſtrange and extraordinary in this <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s Conduct, who appears as a <hi>Patron</hi> for the Doctrine of <hi>abſolute Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> that he ſhould not only enter into an <hi>Offenſive War</hi> with me, and ſlight me unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, but likewiſe caſt <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> upon many Perſons, whom I have the Honour of being related to by <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> who were long ſince dead, and in their <hi>Graves,</hi> and ſo could not poſſibly offend him <note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>I do declare, that I had it not in the Thoughts of my <hi>Heart,</hi> to offer any <hi>Charge</hi> againſt the People of his <hi>Profeſſion</hi> about <hi>Cowardice,</hi> and therefore was not a little ſurprized to meet with our Author's <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions</hi> upon this Head!</p>
            <p>But ſeeing this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is pleaſed to inſinuate a <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Cowardice</hi> againſt many of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with me (and brings ſome <hi>Authors</hi> of his own

Perſwaſion to prove it) I would only obſerve in their Vindication, that the <hi>Inſtance</hi> alledged of their <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> themſelves (in a Time of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> is no Proof of it; foraſmuch as it is but agreeable to the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> who counſels his <hi>Diſciples, when they are perſecuted in one City, to fly to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And pray, have not divers of both our <hi>Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> actually done ſo (for Subſtance) at the Time of the firſt Settlement of this Country? Did they not fly from their native Soil on <hi>Canvas</hi> Wings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the great <hi>Atlantick,</hi> to this then howling <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Wilderneſs,</hi> in order to find a ſecure <hi>Retreat,</hi> from the Tempeſt of <hi>Perſecution?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this Inſtance of our Author's Conduct calm and conſiſtent? I will aſſure him, that the <hi>Sermon</hi> he is diſpleaſed with, was not framed to ſerve the narrow and comparatively mean <hi>Deſigns</hi> of a <hi>Party,</hi> but to promote the common <hi>Benefit</hi> of all the <hi>Societies</hi> of the <hi>Province,</hi> in their <hi>Protection</hi> from impending <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Calamity!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed: Our Author, in order to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <hi>God</hi>'s commanding <hi>War,</hi> under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to his (ſuppoſed) prohibiting it now, propoſes this Expedient, <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 20.21. <hi>namely,</hi> he <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches his Readers to remember, that <hi>he ſuffered and required many Things of the</hi> Jews, <hi>becauſe of the Hardneſs of their Hearts,</hi> which was not to continue in his Church, after the bright Diſcovery of his <hi>Goſpel</hi> was manifeſted.—Is it therefore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe, that this univerſal, glorious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, admits of War and Fighting, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch Nations as profeſs to be under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the ſame Lord and Lawgiver?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, in order to ſhew that the aforeſaid <hi>Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> will not anſwer his <hi>Deſign,</hi> I ſhall firſt mention Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Interpretation of the Place of Scripture
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006247_0060_102820A457A43B18"/>
his Words refer to, <hi>namely, Mat.</hi> xix. 8. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Moſes, becauſe of the Hardneſs of your Hearts, ſuffered you to put away your Wives, but from the Beginning it was not ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poole</hi> obſerves thus upon the aforeſaid Words: <q>The Subſtance of our Saviour's Anſwer ſeemeth to be this, <hi>Moſes</hi> gave you no poſitive <hi>Command</hi> in the Caſe, he could not make a <hi>Law</hi> directly oppoſite to the Law of my <hi>Father.</hi> But <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw the Wantonneſs and Wickedneſs of your Hearts, that you wou'd turn away your <hi>Wives</hi> without any juſt or warrantable Cauſe; and to reſtrain your Extravagance of <hi>Cruelty</hi> to your <hi>Wives,</hi> or diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly turning of them off, upon any Occaſion, he made a Law that none ſhould put away his Wife, but upon a legal Cognizance of the Cauſe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her a Bill of Divorce: And you by your <hi>Traditions</hi> have expounded that Law beyond <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his Intention, and made a Bill of Divorce, grantable in Caſes which he never tho't of, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in that Law: But the <hi>Meaſures</hi> of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> are neither to be taken from <hi>Moſes</hi> his temporary <hi>Toleration,</hi> and much leſs from your <hi>Traditions</hi> and Expoſitions of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but from the original Inſtitution of Marriage, and from God's original Law in Relation to it.</q> The above Expoſition of the Place, I apprehend to be juſt and genuine.</p>
            <p>I wou'd therefore obſerve, that the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>V.</hi> goes upon a wrong <hi>Foundation</hi> in the aforeſaid Paragraph; and hence his Superſtructure cannot be good<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Stabit opus melius, ſi bene fixa baſis, i. e.</hi> If the Foundation be well laid, the Superſtructure will ſtand the better; but on the Contrary, <hi>Debile fundamentum fallit opus.</hi> A weak Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ruins the Fabrick.</note>. He ſaith that HE, meaning GOD, for of him he ſpeaketh, as will appear to every Eye, by the Connection of theſe Words with the foregoing Part
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:006247_0061_102820A7C1894B98"/>
of the Paragraph, <hi>ſuffered and required many Things;</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith it was <hi>Moſes</hi> that <hi>ſuffered,</hi> not <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> the <hi>Jews to put away their Wives,</hi> which was but one Thing; this is a ſtrange complicated Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
            <p>It is admirable that our <hi>Author</hi> ſhou'd aſcribe to <hi>God</hi> by Way of <hi>Command</hi> (for does'nt the Word <hi>Required</hi> ſignify as much) what was only a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary <hi>Permiſſion</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thus contradict our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s expreſs <hi>Declaration,</hi> in no leſs than three Particulars at one <hi>Daſh;</hi> but I hope it was thro' Inadvertency that our <hi>Author</hi> fell into this unhappy <hi>Miſtake,</hi> and that when he conſiders the Matter far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he will correct it.</p>
            <p>In the mean Time, can it be tho't, with the leaſt Shadow of Reaſon, that from ſuch a <hi>Foundation,</hi> any good <hi>Concluſion</hi> can be drawn againſt <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> which GOD the Father, and GOD the Son, repeatedly commanded, approved of, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with their <hi>Preſence</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">See the Sermons upon <hi>Exodus</hi> xv. 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe probable that our <hi>Author</hi> meant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>Jewiſh Ceremonies,</hi> but theſe Things being <hi>Shadows</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt of Conſequence expire and evaniſh, when the <hi>Sun</hi> the <hi>Subſtance</hi> came; but where is there any Ground to believe, that <hi>War</hi> is a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and if ſo, wou'dn't it conclude what my Opponent doesn't like, namely, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an eminent <hi>Warrior,</hi> ſeeing that the <hi>Type</hi> is eminently included in the <hi>Antitype.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther, the <hi>Jewiſh Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> were Things in themſelves indifferent and innocent, antecedent to, or before the divine <hi>Precepts</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and therefore might by divine <hi>Sovereignty</hi> be for a Time enjoined, without any Contradiction to the <hi>Purity</hi> and other <hi>moral Perfections</hi> of the divine <hi>Nature;</hi> but the Caſe is not ſo as to War, it can be
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006247_0062_102820A9A28A8398"/>
no Matter of Indifferency in itſelf, for it conſiſts not in the ſhedding the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Beaſts,</hi> but of <hi>Men;</hi> and therefore if it be not <hi>morally Good,</hi> it is <hi>morally</hi> EVIL in itſelf, before the divine <hi>Precept</hi> reſpecting it: Elſe there is no ſuch Thing in any Inſtance, and all <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> are empty <hi>Names,</hi> and meer <hi>Cyphers,</hi> that have no Foundation in the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Things;</hi> and thus the very <hi>Baſis</hi> of all <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> is ſapp'd: A doleful Stroke indeed!</p>
            <p>For what can more deeply concern the Manners of Men, than the taking away the <hi>human Life?</hi> Which puts a final <hi>Period</hi> to our State of <hi>Trial,</hi> and fixes unalterably our everlaſting <hi>Condition:</hi> Hence one of theſe two Things follows, either that <hi>God</hi> Almighty commanded, encouraged and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of frequently, what is in itſelf <hi>morally Evil,</hi> or elſe that <hi>Defenſive War</hi> is in its own <hi>Nature, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Good,</hi> and conſequently lawful now.</p>
            <p>As to the latter Part of the aforeſaid Paragraph, I anſwer in the Affirmative; that it is, in my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the univerſal glorious <hi>Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel-Diſpenſation</hi> admits of <hi>Defenſive War</hi> and <hi>Fighting,</hi> when Neceſſity requires, even between <hi>Nations</hi> that profeſs to be under the <hi>Government</hi> of the ſame <hi>Lord</hi> and Lawgiver, for theſe Reaſons;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is under the aforeſaid Limitations <hi>morally Good,</hi> as, I hope, appears from what has been already ſaid. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe being ſo, it cannot of itſelf have a Tendency to Contention or Confuſion, or any Thing that is <hi>Evil;</hi> what is Good, cannot in itſelf tend to what is bad; except it be ſuppoſed that a <hi>Cauſe</hi> produces <hi>Effects</hi> contrary in <hi>Kind</hi> to itſelf; which is abſurd, and contrary to the very <hi>Nature</hi> of Things! For thus, upon this <hi>Hypotheſis,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006247_0063_102820AD3165FF00"/>
Light</hi> would produce <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and Darkneſs Light.</p>
            <p>Nay, it is ſo far from this, that the Doctrine of <hi>Defenſive War</hi> directly tends to keep the worſt of Men from <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> by affecting their <hi>Fear,</hi> with a <hi>View</hi> of the <hi>Penalties</hi> they are like to incur thereby; this tends to teach Men <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as pious <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the Men of <hi>Succoth,</hi> with the <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> of the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas the contrary Opinion, by removing the Arguments of <hi>Fear</hi> and Terror from the Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which generally have the moſt Influence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from the <hi>Evils</hi> they <hi>love,</hi> tends to give an ungovernable <hi>Looſe</hi> to their <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,</hi> and ſo opens a <hi>Door</hi> to Violence and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and every evil Work, and therefore in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent degenerate <hi>State</hi> of Mankind, it is of dangerous and pernicious Conſequence!</p>
            <p>Not to add that this Method of affecting the <hi>Fear</hi> of Men, by the threatning of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> againſt Tranſgreſſors, proportioned to their Crimes, and of inflicting it when there is Occaſion, and in this Way endeavouring to deter them from Iniquity; I ſay this is the very Method which the bleſſed <hi>God</hi> himſelf takes with Mankind, in his <hi>Word</hi> written, and by his <hi>Providence,</hi> of which there are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Inſtances; Doesn't the Almighty <hi>hedge up</hi> frequently <hi>the Way of Sinners with Thorns,</hi> to keep them within proper Bounds? Does'n't the allwiſe <hi>God</hi> in the holy Scriptures denounce <hi>Threatnings</hi> of temporal Puniſhments, againſt Tranſgreſſors? And doesn't he at Times inflict them, and therefore from hence, may he not be juſtly called even now, <hi>A Man of War?</hi> And does it not eaſily follow, from what has been ſaid under this Head, that all ſuch who oppoſe <hi>a juſt War</hi> as unlawful under the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> do conſequently (tho' I truſt not deſignedly)
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006247_0064_102820B31E63B960"/>
reflect upon the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God's <hi>Government</hi> over the Children of Men, and labour to make us unlike our <hi>Maker,</hi> imagining that the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> conſiſts in this Inſtance, in our being unlike God; a ſtrange Sort of <hi>Perfection</hi> indeed! For my Part, I cannot but think that JEHOVAH is the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>Pattern</hi> of all <hi>Excellency,</hi> and that the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>intelligent Creatures,</hi> conſiſts in Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him; but it ſeems our <hi>Author</hi> is in this Inſtance of a different Opinion!</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Reaſon why I think the <hi>Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Diſpenſation admits of <hi>Defenſive War</hi> and <hi>Fighting</hi> is, becauſe the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> enjoyed the <hi>Goſpel</hi> as well as we, the very ſame for <hi>Subſtance,</hi> as I have proved at large in the 16 <hi>p.</hi> of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> and in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> which he has tho't proper not to meddle with, for what Reaſon he knows beſt!</p>
            <p>Our Author proceeds to cite another Paragraph of the Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Can we think, my Brethren, that <hi>God</hi> would enjoin and approve of any Practice formerly, that was contrary to the <hi>moral Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoy'd? Surely No! That is contrary to his unalterable <hi>Purity,</hi> of which the <hi>moral Law</hi> is a legible <hi>Copy</hi> and <hi>Exemplar.</hi> Well, if a juſt <hi>War</hi> was not contrary to the <hi>moral Law</hi> under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, and before it, why ſhould it be ſo now, in the like Circumſtances of <hi>Neceſſity?</hi> And if it be not contrary to the <hi>moral Law,</hi> the ſtanding and unalterable <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Conduct,</hi> why ſhould any ſcruple it, or oppoſe it now?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which our Author remarks as follows (<hi>V. p.</hi> 21)</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have already obſerved, that the <hi>Almighty</hi>'s enjoining and approving of ſome Wars formerly, does not authorize any <hi>Wars begun and carried on at the mere Will and Pleaſure of Men.</hi> The <hi>like
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006247_0065_102820B6DCA9A198"/>
Circumſtances of Neceſſity</hi> muſt be, when we have the divine <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Direction,</hi> and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. If it be a Doubt why the dark and diſtant Proſpects of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> had, did not diſcover to them in general, that the Time ſhould come when outward <hi>War</hi> ſhould be laid aſide, the ſame Difficulty recurs with reſpect to <hi>Sacrifices, Burnt-Offerings, Circumciſion, &amp;c.</hi> and yet ſome of the inſpired Prophets foreſaw that Time. If it be objected, that <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. were Types and Figures; ſo, in my Opinion, were the outward Wars and Fightings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and are conſidered in that Light, by reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Writers of many Denominations. That the <hi>moral Law</hi> is the ſtanding and unalterable <hi>Rule</hi> of our Conduct; I grant <hi>as far as it reaches:</hi> But it is not from thence that a Scruple about Fighting ariſes. The bleſſed <hi>Jeſus hath taught ſome Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> both by the <hi>immediate Dictates of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and the Expreſſions of his Will, <hi>when perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> that the beſt Way to keep the Commandments, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> and <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour,</hi> is <hi>not to harbour any Ill-will or Revenge againſt any, but to love Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, That our <hi>Author</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Paragraph,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Shifts the Queſtion in Controverſy; I never pretended to defend <hi>War, begun and carried on at the meer Will and Pleaſure of Men,</hi> or according to their Humours and corrupt Luſts: No!</p>
            <p n="2">2. He gives a wrong <hi>Turn</hi> to thoſe Words, <hi>'The like Circumſtances of Neceſſity,'</hi> contrary to their natural and uſual Acceptation, as if they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the <hi>Time</hi> when we have an immediate <hi>Command</hi> (ſuch as the <hi>Jews</hi> had in ſome Inſtances by the <hi>Urim</hi>) he muſt mean this, or ſay nothing to his Purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:006247_0066_102820BB44712D30"/>
whereas the Words only ſignify our being in the like <hi>Danger</hi> or <hi>Diſtreſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt we ſhou'd conſult the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> in our <hi>Wars,</hi> which contain our ſtanding <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Conduct,</hi> and conſider <hi>God's Providences</hi> towards us, and <hi>pray</hi> to him for <hi>Direction,</hi> and in this Way we may expect to know the <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> did by the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> nor did they in all Caſes conſult that <hi>Oracle,</hi> but in difficult only; <hi>When they heard that the Two Tribes and a Half had built an Altar by Jordan, the whole Congregation gathered themſelves together at Shiloh, to War againſt them;</hi> but ſo far as we can learn, did not conſult the <hi>Urim, Joſh.</hi> xxii. 12.

            <p>To imagine that the <hi>Jewiſh Wars</hi> were <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> of the ſpiritual <hi>Wars</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> againſt <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> as it wants a ſcriptural <hi>Foundation,</hi> ſo it is attended with this Abſurdity, <hi>viz.</hi> It either ſuppoſes that the pious <hi>Jews</hi> had no <hi>ſpiritual War,</hi> which is falſe; or elſe that the Type and Thing ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified (for Subſtance) exiſted together, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd!

            </p>
            <p>Why ſhould it be ſuppoſed, that <hi>War</hi> is any Part of the <hi>ceremonial Law,</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> peculiarly given to

            </p>
            <p>But if it be for Argument ſake ſuppos'd, will our <hi>Author</hi> ſay that it is lawful in any Caſe, to offer <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> And where do we find that ever <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was permitted to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles?</hi>

               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:006247_0068_102820C1231070C0"/>Now ſeeing the <hi>Almighty</hi> commanded both <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Defenſive War</hi> under the <hi>Jewiſh Diſpenſation,</hi> then either they can conſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or God commanded inconſiſtent Things at the ſame Time; but ſeeing the latter is abſurd, and conveys a <hi>horrible Notion</hi> of the <hi>bleſſed God</hi> as an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Being!</hi> the former muſt therefore be true.</p>
            <p>Farther, let it be obſerved, that <hi>Love to our Neighbours as ourſelves,</hi> was as expreſly enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the <hi>Jewiſh Diſpenſation</hi> as now: See <hi>Levit.</hi> xix. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, I am the Lord;</hi> and therefore it is conſiſtent with <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> for that was at the ſame Time enjoined, or elſe the aforeſaid abſurd and terrible Conſequence will follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded contrary Things at the ſame Time!</p>
            <p>Moreover <hi>Revenge</hi> was as expreſly forbid under the <hi>Jewiſh Diſpenſation,</hi> as under the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> xix. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not avenge or bear any Grudge againſt the Children of thy People; Prov.</hi> xxiv. 28, 29. <hi>Be not a Witneſs againſt thy Neighbour, without Cauſe—Say not I will do to him as he hath done to me, I will render to the Man according to his Work.</hi> Hence one of two Things neceſſarily follows; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>private Revenge</hi> is a Thing different from, and contrary to <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> or that <hi>Almighty God</hi> both commanded and forbid the ſame Thing at the ſame Time; for while he forbad <hi>Revenge,</hi> he commanded <hi>Defenſive War;</hi> the Abſurdity of which every Eye may ſee!</p>
            <p>Meer REVENGE, which propoſes no <hi>Aim</hi> but the <hi>Grief</hi> or <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of him who hath hurt us, is contrary to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But the Caſe of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in the <hi>Execution</hi> of <hi>Criminals,</hi> is quite different, as I obſerved in the S. <hi>p.</hi> 32. <q>He <hi>loves</hi> them as <hi>Fellow Creatures,</hi> and <hi>compaſſionates</hi> their <hi>Miſeries</hi> from a Principle of <hi>Humanity;</hi> and yet in the mean Time he muſt put them to <hi>Death,</hi> not out of perſonal <hi>Revenge,</hi> but to promote <hi>Juſtice</hi> and the good <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> And thus it is in reſpect of <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> directs to fly thereto, as the laſt Remedy, of Neceſſity, <hi>S. p.</hi> 10. The Severities exercis'd thereby, ſhould be only when the Caſe comes to <hi>Extremity,</hi> and our own <hi>Safety</hi> abſolutely requires it, and only then <hi>as far</hi> as it does require it, and that with <hi>Reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion, S. p.</hi> 29.</q> So that a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Deſire of <hi>Revenge,</hi> is neither the <hi>Principle</hi> that animates <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> nor the Scope to which it is directed; but a juſt <hi>Regard</hi> to <hi>God's commanding Authority,</hi> is the <hi>Source</hi> from which it ſprings, and the <hi>Protection</hi> of our own, as well as our dear <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives Perſons</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> from unjuſt <hi>Violence,</hi> is the <hi>End</hi> to which it tends, and in which it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates!</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Execution</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> upon <hi>Criminals</hi> by the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> either after an ordinary <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Trial,</hi> or by the extraordinary <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> is called <hi>Revenge</hi> only <hi>improperly,</hi> and in a large Senſe; becauſe of the <hi>Effect</hi> thereof, which ſomewhat reſembles it. But in the mean Time it differs as much in its <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> from what is <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> called <hi>Revenge,</hi> as <hi>Light</hi> from <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and therefore can conſiſt with <hi>Love:</hi> The due Conſideration of theſe Things, wou'd

prevent our being impoſed upon, by a meer Sound of <hi>harſh Words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author next proceeds to a Paragraph in the <hi>Sermon, p.</hi> 20. with which the 18 and 19 <hi>p.</hi> have a Connection, which ſeeing he has tho't proper, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for prudential Reaſons, to give but a brief Hint of, I will take the Liberty to cite more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <q>And ſhould not the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> protect his <hi>Subjects</hi> from unjuſt <hi>Violence?</hi> Is not this the <hi>Deſign</hi> of their <hi>Office, that under them we may live quiet Lives,</hi> and that they may be to us a <hi>Hiding-place from the Wind, and a Covert from the Tempeſt</hi> of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion! Why elſe is the <hi>Sword</hi> committed to them, and can they always <hi>protect</hi> us without <hi>War,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſing Force to Force? No ſurely!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now unleſs the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> puniſhes <hi>Criminals</hi> in his own <hi>Community,</hi> and ſcreens his <hi>Subjects</hi> from a <hi>foreign Force,</hi> what is his <hi>Office</hi> but an empty <hi>Name,</hi> a meer <hi>Cypher,</hi> of no Moment and Conſequence to <hi>Society?</hi> Nor is it reaſonable he ſhould expect <hi>Support, Honour</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> from his <hi>Subjects,</hi> if they in Conſequence hereof, do not obtain <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> from him. In the mean Time it ſhould be carefully obſerved, that the <hi>Magiſtrate's Office,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Duties</hi> of it, does not belong to the <hi>political Laws</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were alterable, but to the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely by the Word PARENT in the Fifth COMMAND, we are not only to underſtand natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but political Parents; the MAGISTRATE is the FATHER of his COUNTRY by OFFICE, and then only indeed does he merit that honourable <hi>Character,</hi> and act up to it, when by forming and executing wholſome penal <hi>Laws,</hi> he ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Injuſtice</hi> among his <hi>Children,</hi> when by prudent and neceſſary Preparations, and when Neceſſity

requires, by vigorous and valiant <hi>Efforts,</hi> he guards them from a foreign <hi>Enemy!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> may, and ſometimes muſt uſe <hi>Force</hi> in ſuppreſſing <hi>Tumults,</hi> and puniſhing <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents</hi> in his own <hi>Domains,</hi> and among his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Subjects,</hi> elſe all <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> muſt ceaſe, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

May he according to the expreſs Word of God, puniſh <hi>his criminal Subjects</hi> with <hi>Death,</hi> in ſome Caſes, agreeable to that famous Scripture, <hi>He that ſheds Man's Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed;</hi> and ſhall he not inflict it upon others equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty, eſpecially when this becomes neceſſary to <hi>defend himſelf</hi> and his <hi>Country</hi> from <hi>Deſolation</hi> and <hi>Ruin?</hi> Can it be reaſonably imagined, that a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould ſhew greater <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency</hi> to Foreigners and <hi>Strangers,</hi> than to his own <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> to whom he is under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Obligations,</hi> both natural and political?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Nor has our Lord Jeſus, in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſanulled the Magiſtrate's <hi>Office,</hi> which is ſo needful to <hi>Society;</hi> No! But on the contrary honoured and eſtabliſh'd it, by his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Example;</hi> he enjoined his Diſciples, <hi>To give to Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's, to give Honour to whom Honour is due, and Tribute to whom Tribute; to be ſubject to the higher Powers, and that for this Reaſon, becauſe there is no Power but of God, and the Powers that be, are ordained of God;</hi> and he himſelf paid <hi>Tribute,</hi> yea rather than this important <hi>Duty</hi> ſhould be neglected, he procured <hi>Money</hi> by a <hi>Miracle.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us hear how our <hi>Author</hi> anſwers to the aforeſaid <hi>Argument,</hi> which I look upon to be the Chief that I have offered, upon which the whole

Cauſe very much reſts; his Anſwer is as follows (<hi>V. p.</hi> 22, 23)</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Upon which I remark, that whenever</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is convinced that the Doctrines of Chriſt forbid War, it will be as much his Duty, as any other Man's, to render Obedience to thoſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. However the People called Quakers, do not undertake to condemn their Superiors engaging in War, in the preſent unhappy State of human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: <hi>We rather</hi> think it probable, <hi>that as they have ſhewn a noble and Chriſtian Diſpoſition, in granting Liberty and Protection to ſuch as are of tender Conſciences,</hi> it may pleaſe God to bleſs their Arms with Succeſs, <hi>and reward them for their Kindneſs to his People, who deſire to live in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the inward Appearance of his Spirit, which leads to</hi> Purity <hi>and</hi> Perfection: <hi>And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Advice of the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, <hi>we find it our</hi> Duty, to put up Prayers for Kings, and them that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty, <hi>1</hi> Tim. <hi>ii. 1, 2.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if it be the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>'s <hi>Duty,</hi> to <hi>render Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that <hi>forbid War,</hi> when <hi>convinced,</hi> then he muſt either quit his <hi>Office,</hi> or bear the <hi>Sword,</hi> the <hi>Enſign</hi> of it, in vain; for in this Way, the <hi>End</hi> of that <hi>Inſtitution</hi> cannot be anſwered; but the latter is abſurd; namely, to carry an empty Title, a <hi>Name</hi> without the <hi>Thing,</hi> and therefore the former muſt take Place; and hence it follows, That if all <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced as aforeſaid, they muſt all, wou'd they act with Decency and Conſiſtency, quit their <hi>Places,</hi> and then there wou'd be no <hi>Government</hi> at all!

            <p n="2">2. Why doesn't our <hi>Author</hi> anſwer to my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the <hi>fifth Command,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>'s <hi>Office,</hi> which I ſignified in the <hi>Sermon</hi> ſhou'd be <hi>carefully obſerved?</hi> Is it included or not, in that <hi>Precept?</hi> Why doesn't our <hi>Author</hi> ſpeak out his Mind plainly? Is it the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>'s <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>protect</hi> his <hi>Subjects</hi> or not? If nay, then his <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> is a meer <hi>Bubble,</hi> which only deſerves to be laugh'd at; if yea, then <hi>Defenſive War</hi> is included in the <hi>moral Law,</hi> and conſequently is lawful now; unleſs it be ſuppos'd, that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> oppoſes and deſtroys the <hi>moral Law,</hi> which as it is contrary to the expreſs <hi>Declaration</hi> of Chriſt himſelf, elſewhere cited in this <hi>Reply,</hi> ſo it tends to tear up by the <hi>Roots</hi> all <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> at one diſmal <hi>Daſh!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our Author had faulted any Part of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Train</hi> of <hi>Reaſonings</hi> about the <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> he ſhould have declared it; but ſeeing he has not, his Silence gives Conſent to the whole, which therefore concludes to the <hi>Overthrow</hi> of his <hi>Cauſe!</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is wholeſome Doctrine indeed, with which I cordially concur, and am glad to have ſuch a <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> in favour of the late <hi>excellent</hi> ASSOCIATION; in the mean Time allow me to propoſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Queries; namely,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:006247_0075_102820D9B79BB7C0"/>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1. If this be the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Sentiments, do they not firmly hold the Lawfulneſs of <hi>Defenſive War</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 2. Then how comes our <hi>Author,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears under the <hi>Character</hi> of their <hi>Apologiſt</hi> (before an <hi>Attack</hi>) to contradict them ſo much in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Performance? In his Preface he declares, that <hi>War</hi> is <hi>abſolutely forbid</hi> by the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi>
               <q>I thought, <hi>ſays he,</hi> the Sermon was to prove that agreeable to the Doctrines of Chriſt, which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely forbid thereby.</q> Now, what was the <hi>Scheme</hi> of the <hi>Sermon</hi> to prove but <hi>Defenſive War?</hi> The <hi>Title</hi> and whole <hi>Frame</hi> of it ſhew this. And <hi>V. p.</hi> 23. he calls it an <hi>Evil,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a forſaking of the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> his Words are theſe; <q>Thus the Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Goſpel being forſook for worldly Pomp and Power, inſtead of the loving and forgiving Temper, which it enjoined, it was miſconſtrued to allow of Violence and Oppreſſion in this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> from the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> many <hi>Evils</hi> which the primitive Chriſtians were redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, come to be reckoned neceſſary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; and, ſpeaking of the primitive Friends, he ſays, they were convinced by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Sinfulneſs of War.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, ſo great is the <hi>Evil</hi> ſuppoſed to be, that our Author informs us, <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 3. That ſuch who hold it <hi>doctrinally,</hi> are to be excluded from <hi>Church Fellowſhip;</hi>
               <q>And they eſteem it, ſaith he, their <hi>Duty</hi> to teſtify, that ſuch are not in <hi>Unity</hi> with them, who, making Profeſſion of this inward Principle, manifeſt a Conduct contrary to it.</q> If ſo,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 3. How can he or they forbear condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo great a <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> as he repreſents <hi>War</hi> of all Kinds to be, if they are of the ſame <hi>Opinion</hi> with him? And much more, how can a Bleſſing
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:006247_0076_102820E0522BF270"/>
from <hi>God</hi> be expected upon what is ſuppoſed to be an <hi>abominable Iniquity,</hi> and that Bleſſing <hi>prayed</hi> for? I profeſs, it ſurpaſſes the Reach of my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to reconcile theſe Things together!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 4. Is there no Appearance (at leaſt) of great <hi>Uncharitableneſs</hi> in the aforeſaid Paragraph, in confining Perſons of <hi>tender Conſciences,</hi> and <hi>true Chriſtianity,</hi> to the narrow Pale of the <hi>Quaker So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> or peculiar Principles? <hi>To his People, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live in Obedience to the inward Appearance of his Spirit, which leads to Purity and Perfection?</hi> Now, who can we underſtand by thoſe Terms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our Author's <hi>Vind.</hi> but ſuch as are for immediate <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and againſt <hi>Defenſive War?</hi> Isn't Gratitude expreſſed for <hi>Liberty</hi> granted to thoſe, and to no others; and a <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Succeſs</hi> upon our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi>'s <hi>Arms,</hi> grounded alone upon that <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Isn't this ſtrange and hard to account for?</p>
            <p>But, bleſſed be <hi>God,</hi> whatever our Author may imagine to the contrary, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Sheep</hi> are not cooped up in one <hi>Fold,</hi> but ſcattered in many; we have Reaſon to rejoice that the Lord is to be our Judge, and not ſhort ſighted Creatures.</p>
            <p>Here I would beg Leave to tranſcribe the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> upon that famous <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> cited by our <hi>Author,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort therefore, that firſt of all Supplications, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Interceſſions, be made for all Men; for Kings, and all in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty. For this is</hi> GOOD AND ACCEPTABLE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD OUR SAVIOUR. Hence, ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi>
               <q>We are taught three Things; 1. That it is pleaſing to God that <hi>Kings</hi> ſhould become <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> 2. That being converted to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> they ſtill continue <hi>Kings;</hi> which <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> thus expreſſed, We pray that Kings and Princes may, together with their royal

And in the Book intitled, The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of <hi>Clement,</hi> the Church prays, <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ta tele,</hi> for Chriſtian Magiſtrates. And 3. That it is acceptable to God that Chriſtian <hi>Kings</hi> ſhould contribute their utmoſt to the <hi>Quiet</hi> of others. But how he explains this in another Place, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii. 4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to thee for Good; if thou do Ill, be afraid, for he beareth not the Sword in vain; for he is God's Miniſter, an Avenger to execute Wrath upon them that do Evil. Under the Right of the Sword is figuratively comprehended eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſort of Puniſhment</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The next Particular taken notice of by my <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is what I have ſaid upon the Counſel of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> to the Soldiers, S. p. 20. the Force of which he endeavours to evade by three Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. 1. He ſays, 'They were <hi>Roman Soldiers.</hi>' Anſwer, What then? Should not they be told their Duty for that Reaſon? 2. <q>If abſtaining from War be the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>S. V.</hi> p. 23) that is a Point the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be learnt, is it likely or reaſonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that <hi>John,</hi> upon the Pagan Soldiers firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plcation, ſhould declare that to them?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer, Here our <hi>Author,</hi> as uſual, begs the <hi>Queſtion</hi> in <hi>Diſpute.</hi> I deny abſtaining from War totally to be any <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> at all; it is ſo far from a <hi>Perfection</hi> in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tells us what he would do. Anſwer, What is that to the Purpoſe? It is what he ſhould do we enquire after, and not the other. If he would not reprove Men for what he reckons ſinful, who can help that? Farther, he enquires, towards the Cloſe of his Paragraph, p. 24. Can War ſubſiſt
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:006247_0078_102820E9EB636430"/>
without Violence? Anſwer, Yes, without private Violence or Ravages. The <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, tho' they allowed <hi>Soldiers</hi> to take Prey from Enemies, yet did not permit the leaſt Injury to Friends <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Annot. Bez. &amp; Calv. in Loc.</note>.</p>
            <p>If theſe Words, <hi>do Violence to no Man,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a conſiſtent View with the other Part of the Advice, <hi>to be content with their Wages,</hi> it can reaſonably be ſuppoſed to mean no more, than to abſtain from <hi>private Plunders</hi> and <hi>Ravages,</hi> an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> which <hi>Soldiers</hi> are at Times under ſtrong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to!</p>
            <p>Or that they ſhould beware of engaging in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt War,</hi> or of exerciſing Inhumanity and Cruelty towards thoſe they conquered by a juſt One, ſeeing his adviſing them to be content with their Wages, is a tacite Approbation of that Work for which they received them.</p>
            <p>The Abuſes of War by ſome can be no juſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the regular Uſe of it. It is true, it is attended with diſtreſſing Circumſtances; but it is as true, that the utter Rejection of it, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <hi>paſſive</hi> under the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Ravages</hi> of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>Banditti,</hi> is much more ſo; and indeed this makes us <hi>criminal,</hi> as well as <hi>miſerable!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> next attacks my Argument from the Inſtance of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> S. p. 21. This he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to confute, <hi>V. p.</hi> 24, 25. The Grounds he goes upon are two, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His uſual <hi>begging</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion</hi> in <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi> he takes it for granted, that the Denial of every kind of War is a Point of <hi>Perfection</hi> in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which I abſolutely deny; and upon this <hi>Foundation,</hi> which he has offered no Arguments in his whole <hi>Performance</hi> to eſtabliſh, he proceeds farther to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that our Lord knew the beſt Method to deal
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:006247_0079_102820EDCEBE3F08"/>
with frail Mortals, was to lead them by Degrees to <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer;</hi> This is not applicable to his <hi>Argument,</hi> unleſs he had firſt proved, that the rejecting of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive War</hi> was a <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He labours to divert the Force of my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by obſerving, that if the <hi>Sermon-writer</hi> could have proved, that after this Miracle, which our Lord wrought, that if the <hi>Centurion</hi> had retained his <hi>military Employ,</hi> there would have been ſome Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for my Argument.</p>
            <p>I reply, it is a <hi>Miſtake;</hi> an Argument of Right is vaſtly better than from <hi>Fact,</hi> in fallible, imperfect <hi>Creatures:</hi> I enquired what was his Duty to do, and not what he did; it is not by the <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> but by the <hi>Laws</hi> of God, that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our Conduct!</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſeeing our Author's <hi>Opinion</hi> ſuppoſes the <hi>Repeal</hi> of an eſtabliſhed <hi>Practice,</hi> it is his Buſineſs to ſhew, that the Centurion did not retain his <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Office:</hi> We do not find that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid a Word againſt his Continuance in it; No! but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he elſewhere <hi>commands to render to Ceſar the Things that are Ceſar's;</hi> among which was the TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BUTE MONEY, wherewith the SOLDIERS were SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PORTED. Now, if this had been ſimply unlawful, would CHRIST have enjoined it for that End, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Reproof,</hi> yea, and paid the <hi>Tribute Himſelf?</hi> Doesn't CHRIST'S PRECEPTS and PRACTICE, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the TRIBUTE MONEY, plainly imply his <hi>Approbation</hi> of a juſt or <hi>Defenſive War?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Argument</hi> is not drawn from the <hi>Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s not laying down his <hi>Office,</hi> but from Chriſt's not enjoining him ſo to do.</p>
            <p>The next Argument in the <hi>Sermon</hi> that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> is pleaſed to animadvert upon, is that from <hi>John</hi> xviii. 36. <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World, elſe
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:006247_0080_102820F1E73B8C70"/>
would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Jews,</hi> S. p. 22.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author,</hi> to compaſs his End, cites Mr. <hi>Poole</hi>'s Annotations on the Place; which, tho' they ſhew that it was not the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Diſciples</hi> to <hi>fight</hi> for his <hi>Protection,</hi> in his preſent extraordinary <hi>Situation,</hi> or to promote his <hi>ſpiritual Kingdom;</hi> yet they confirm the Point I had in View in my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>For was there ever an earthly Prince apprehended and bound, for whom none of his <hi>Servants</hi> would take up <hi>Arms?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> deſires me to conſider, whether Chriſt's directing us to <hi>pray, That his Will may be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven, does not much more clearly expreſs an Injunction to live in Love and Peace?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Defenſive War</hi> is conſiſtent with <hi>Love,</hi> as I have before ſhewn; if not, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Magiſtrate? See this Matter opened in the Sermon, p. 31, 32. which it ſeems our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thought it prudent to paſs over in Silence;—and is it not the Deſign of <hi>Defenſive War</hi> to procure <hi>Peace</hi> by <hi>Conſtraint?</hi> Moreover, the <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> are Warriors, as appears from the preceding Sermons!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> is one Thing, and human <hi>Society</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the former is ſpiritual, the latter temporal; and therefore ſpiritual Weapons are ſuited in Nature and Kind to the one, and temporal to the other: How unreaſonable is it therefore to ſuppoſe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt's <hi>Reign</hi> in the Soul, which is a ſpiritual Thing, cannot be promoted or maintained by <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Means</hi> (directly or immediately) that therefore a <hi>temporal Kingdom</hi> cannot, or ſhould not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, or preſerved by them, under God, which are of the ſame Kind with it, and ſuited to it! This is juſt, in other Words, to ſay, Becauſe that unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Means will not anſwer the End, therefore ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:006247_0081_102820F369F0D100"/>
will not! According to the aforeſaid plain <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> of our Lord, the <hi>Subjects</hi> of a <hi>temporal King</hi> may, and ought to fight, in the Defence of their <hi>King,</hi> their <hi>Country,</hi> and <hi>civil Privileges;</hi> and that for this <hi>Reaſon,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Mean</hi> is ſuited to the <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to open this Matter a little more, let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that there are two notable <hi>Societies</hi> among Men, namely, <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> which, tho' they appear mixed and confuſed, becauſe the ſame Perſons are frequently Members of both, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding diſtinct and different from each other; they tend to different <hi>Ends</hi> by different <hi>Means,</hi> and have reſpectively different <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Power.</hi> The <hi>End</hi> of eccleſiaſtical or religious <hi>Society,</hi> is everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Happineſs;</hi> but the End of civil <hi>Society,</hi> is the Peace and Safety of the <hi>State:</hi> Theſe <hi>Ends</hi> being very different, it is no Wonder if the <hi>Means</hi> condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to them be ſo likewiſe. To eternal Happineſs none can come, except by an unconſtrained and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience to the divine Precepts, iſſuing from Faith and Love, which it is the great Buſineſs of <hi>Religion</hi> to promote: But, on the other hand, it is no Matter to the <hi>State,</hi> whether its <hi>Laws</hi> are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd <hi>freely</hi> or not; if they be but <hi>obey'd</hi> outwardly, it is enough; this <hi>Obedience</hi> it is their proper <hi>Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to procure, which may be effected by the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> In ſhort, the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> extends to Mens <hi>Bodies,</hi> but that of the <hi>Church</hi> reſpects the Soul: The former may, and therefore ought to be compelled to <hi>Obedience,</hi> thro' a Dread of Puniſhment and Death; but the latter cannot be forced by outward <hi>Violence;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Church</hi> can have no Power over it, nor reclaim Delinquents any other Way, but by <hi>Reproof, Counſel, Entreaty,</hi> and in caſe of perſevering <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them unworthy of their <hi>Communion.</hi> The <hi>Laws</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:006247_0082_102820F505202240"/>
of civil <hi>Society</hi> reſpect the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> but the <hi>Canons</hi> of Churches are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to promote and preſerve <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> of <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> From theſe <hi>Principles</hi> it eaſily and clearly follows, that the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is only ſpiritual, and the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> only temporal.</p>
            <p>Now our Lord Jeſus by the Text aforeſaid, plainly informs us, that he came not into the World to exerciſe the <hi>Power</hi> and Dominion of a temporal <hi>Prince; Auguſtine</hi> upon this Scripture ſpeaketh thus, <q>Hear ye <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> hear ye earthly <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> I hinder not your <hi>Domination</hi> or civil Rule in this World<note n="†" place="bottom">Audite ergo Judaei et Gentes—Audite omnia regna terrena; non impedio dominationem veſtram in hoc mundo. <hi>Tract. 15. in</hi> Joannem.</note>.</q> Our Lord did not only by <hi>Words,</hi> but by <hi>Deeds</hi> declare, that he came not to aſſume a civil <hi>Authority</hi> over temporal Things, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by his <hi>Flight,</hi> leaſt he ſhould be choſe a <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and alſo by his refuſing to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the <hi>Office</hi> of a civil <hi>Judge</hi> upon their temporal Affairs; when he was entreated to divide an <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> he reply'd, <hi>Man, Who made me a Judge or Divider over you?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Go to thoſe to whom that <hi>Power</hi> is committed; hence <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> upon this Place, ſaith, <q>He juſtly declin'd intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling in their temporal Affairs, who only deſcended to promote heavenly, nor did he think it proper to commence a <hi>Judge</hi> of their <hi>Debates</hi>

            <p>But I haſten to the next <hi>Argument</hi> (or rather <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration</hi> of what has been reaſon'd upon before) which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> takes Notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> Acts x. S. <hi>p.</hi> 23.</p>

               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:006247_0083_102820FA9826BD40"/>Upon which he aſks this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> 'Is <hi>Cornelius commended</hi> for his <hi>military Office?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer, No! I offered no ſuch Argument, and therefore his Query is impertinent, but ſeems artful, and calculated to turn my <hi>Argument</hi> out of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Channel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He obſerves that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had the <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>devout Man</hi>—before he was inſtructed in the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>

            <p>In the next Place, our <hi>Author</hi> endeavours to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate my Anſwer, to an Objection that might be formed, from theſe Words of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 2 Cor.

            <p>I anſwer, the Conſequence is unfair, and not bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed on the Words he cites. The Apoſtle doesn't ſay that they didn't <hi>war in the Fleſh,</hi> but only, that they <hi>didn't war after the Fleſh;</hi> i. e. for <hi>fleſhly</hi> or wicked <hi>Ends,</hi> from <hi>fleſhly</hi> or wicked <hi>Principles,</hi> and in a <hi>fleſhly</hi> or wicked <hi>Way,</hi> as the Word <hi>Fleſh</hi> is ſometimes taken in a good Senſe in Scripture; and hence <hi>all Fleſh is ſaid to be Graſs;</hi> ſo ſometimes in a bad; and thus he that is ſaid <hi>to be born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh.</hi> Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> in his Annotations upon the Place, favours the Senſe I have given; his Words are theſe; <q>Tho' our Souls are in a State of Union to our <hi>Bodies,</hi> yet we war not after the Fleſh, neither as fleſhly Men, or in a fleſhly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor yet for fleſhly <hi>Ends;</hi> the Men of the World war for their Honour and Glory, or for Revenge and Satisfaction of their Luſts, or for the Enlargement of their Territories and Dominions; but we do not thus?,</q> No! that is a wicked, <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive War,</hi> which our Author does well to oppoſe. Does the aforeſaid Text ſpeak any thing againſt a
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:006247_0091_102821154A148160"/>
lawful War? No! only directs us how to conduct all Actions to the divine Acceptance; and therefore our Author's Charge of Abſurdity wants a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! But not perceiving this himſelf,</p>
            <p>Our Author proceeds to confute a Paragraph in the Sermon, p. 25, 26. which ſignifies, that it is preſumptuous to expect an <hi>End</hi> without the Uſe of <hi>Means</hi> ſuited to it; <q>To expect a <hi>Crop</hi> by the <hi>Dint</hi> of our <hi>Supplications,</hi> without <hi>plowing;</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> from unreaſonable Men, without uſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Means</hi> for <hi>Defence,</hi> are equally unreaſonable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> offers ſeveral Things to overſet the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Paragraph, the Force of which I ſhall as briefly as poſſible examine. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He obſerves, <hi>V.</hi> p. 31. <q>That the <hi>Means</hi> which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> allows for maintaining and keeping of <hi>Peace,</hi> are, in the firſt and chiefeſt Place, the Practice of Chriſtian <hi>Virtues.</hi>
               </q> Very true, they are excellent in Nature and Tendency, and it were to be wiſhed that they prevailed more in the <hi>World</hi> than they do; <hi>offenſive War</hi> is not like to come from that Quarter, where they have the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant!</p>
            <p>But does our <hi>Author</hi> think, that <hi>when a Man's Ways pleaſe the Lord,</hi> that he will <hi>always</hi> make his <hi>Enemies</hi> to be at peace with him? If ſo, then what ſhall we think of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> And what of theſe Sayings of <hi>Jeſus? That his Diſciples muſt bear his Croſs, and be hated of all Men for his Name's ſake, and that the World ſhall hate them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to any good Underſtanding that has ſubſiſted between this <hi>Province</hi> and any <hi>Pagan</hi> Nations, it is to be acknowledged with all Thankfulneſs, as a great and undeſerved <hi>Mercy of God!</hi> yet I cannot think that it is any certain <hi>Argument</hi> of the ſuperior <hi>Piety</hi> of the firſt <hi>Planters</hi> (tho' I have no Inclination or
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:006247_0092_1028211B5D6129F8"/>
Intention to reflect upon them, being unacquainted with their <hi>Character</hi>) and my Reaſon is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wiſe Man obſerves, <hi>That we cannot know either Love or Hatred, by all that is before us; and there is one Event to the Righteous, and to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a State of <hi>Trial,</hi> and not of <hi>Rewards;</hi> and hence it is that <hi>Events</hi> are promiſcuous, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, there can be no certain Concluſion drawn rationally from them, concerning the States of Men.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the ſuperior <hi>Piety</hi> of the firſt <hi>Settlers</hi> of this <hi>Province,</hi> and their good <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Harmony</hi> with <hi>numerous warlike Nations;</hi> yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Particulars ſingly, nor both complexly, will prove that they were right in all their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Sentiments,</hi> becauſe a gracious God, when the Intention is ſincere, may, and does ſometimes overlook and forgive <hi>Miſtakes</hi> in <hi>Principle,</hi> about Things not eſſential to <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as <hi>Failures</hi> in <hi>Practice,</hi> naturally conſequent thereupon, and vouchſafes his favourable <hi>Smiles,</hi> notwithſtanding; which is indeed a great Argument of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and Condeſcenſion, and of the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of his <hi>Grace,</hi> but no certain <hi>Evidence</hi> of the Juſtneſs of the <hi>Sentiments,</hi> or <hi>Regularity</hi> in the Practices of Men of any Denomination in this or that Inſtance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I am credibly informed, that the good Underſtanding which this Province has had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> has been only with the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> with which the other <hi>American</hi> Colonies have had Peace likewiſe; ſo that there is nothing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Matter.</p>
            <p>Not to ſay that the aforeſaid good Underſtanding has been doubtleſs maintained by the Uſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means, ſuch as <hi>Treaties,</hi> and repeated Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But now I am told that the <hi>State</hi> of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with ſome of the <hi>Indian Tribes</hi> is <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:006247_0093_10282122A95EA320"/>
which ſhould alarm the Inhabitants of this Province, to prepare for their <hi>Defence</hi> againſt ſuch <hi>ſavage Enemies,</hi> whoſe <hi>Barbarities</hi> in <hi>War</hi> are too ſhocking to relate!</p>
            <p>But tho' the Practice of <hi>Humility, Meekneſs, Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> &amp;c. are very good to continue <hi>Peace</hi> where it is; what ſhall be done to procure it where it is loſt, if <hi>Defenſive War</hi> be denied? Muſt we tamely deliver up our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> to the <hi>Luſts</hi> of Men, without Controul? No! our <hi>Author</hi> ſeems to acknowledge the contrary, by ſaying,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>And the Truſt repoſed in the <hi>civil Power,</hi> for the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of <hi>Evil-doers,</hi> &amp;c. faithfully diſcharged, we ſhould be ſo bleſſed and favoured with the peculiar Care of <hi>Heaven,</hi> that no violent Men ſhould be permitted to make a Prey of us;</q> This is ſound Doctrine indeed; but pray how can the <hi>Truſt</hi> repoſed in the <hi>civil Power</hi> be <hi>faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,</hi> without preparing for <hi>Defence</hi> againſt an <hi>Enemy,</hi> and actually wielding the <hi>Sword</hi> for that Purpoſe, when there is Occaſion? Without theſe, to talk of the <hi>civil Power's diſcharging its Truſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> is, in my Opinion, unintelligible <hi>Jargon</hi> and <hi>Gibberiſh;</hi> and if theſe Things be allowed, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives up his Cauſe. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Author thinks, that to expect a <hi>Crop</hi> by the <hi>Dint</hi> of our <hi>Supplications,</hi> and to expect <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> on account of our <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> are not ſimilar Caſes. Why ſo? 1. Becauſe that the <hi>Means</hi> to procure a <hi>Crop,</hi> are neceſſary, <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to the <hi>Creation,</hi> but <hi>War</hi> is ruinous and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to it. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Very true; <hi>offenſive War</hi> is ſo; and therefore <hi>defenſive</hi> being its contrary, is excellent and neceſſary to preſerve the <hi>Creation</hi> from <hi>Ruin!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Some have learnt of their Lord not to fight, <hi>V. p.</hi> 32. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> We have no ſufficient Ground to believe a Claim to immediate <hi>Revelation</hi> in any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:006247_0094_1028229C86839A40"/>
they prove it by <hi>miraculous Works;</hi> and when this ſuppoſed <hi>Revelation</hi> enjoins any Thing in itſelf unreaſonable, and oppoſes any <hi>moral Duty,</hi> which I think I have proved <hi>Self-defence</hi> to be, we have good Ground to believe it is a <hi>Miſtake;</hi> for the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is conſiſtent with himſelf in all his <hi>Precepts:</hi> And indeed ſuch a dangerous <hi>Miſtake</hi> ſhould warn, and invite us to keep cloſe to the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> to <hi>the ſurer Word of Prophecy,</hi> as well as to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue highly, and uſe humbly, in Subordination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that <hi>Reaſon</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath graciouſly given us, leſt we fall into many more.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Author</hi> proceeds to enquire, <hi>V. p.</hi> 33. <q>Is it not more conſiſtent with the <hi>Duty</hi> of a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of the Meek, Self-denying <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to recommend Piety and Prayers, as the only acceptable <hi>Means</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obtain the Protection of <hi>Heaven?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer in the Negative, No! a Miniſter of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſhould tell the Truth, and <hi>deliver the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of God.</hi> A <hi>Watchman, when he ſees the Sword coming upon a Land, ſhould blow the Trumpet, and warn the People, otherwiſe their Blood will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at his Hand!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> proceeds next to conſider what I have ſaid upon the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ii. 4. upon which he ſpends ſeveral Pages, <hi>V.</hi> 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. He cenſures my Interpretation of the Prophecy, and thinks it was deſigned to ſignify an utter Excluſion of all <hi>War</hi> of every Kind; and therefore concludes it ſinful for pious People to be concerned in <hi>War</hi> at all; this I take to be the Subſtance of what he has ſaid. I have in the Sermon aſſerted, that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> inclines all that receive it in Truth, <hi>to live as much as is poſſible in Peace with all Men:</hi> That it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an <hi>internal Peace,</hi> and that probably there will be a <hi>Time,</hi> before the End of the World, when the Power of <hi>Religion</hi> ſhall prevail more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:006247_0095_10282127C181FC80"/>
than at preſent, and outward Peace flouriſh, as the Conſequent of it. <hi>See S. p.</hi> 26, 27.</p>
            <p>The Difference then between us lies in this ſingle Point, of the Lawfulneſs of uſing <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> till that Time comes when there will be no Occaſion for it; I aſſert this, and he denies it; let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine the Grounds of his <hi>Negative.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>The <hi>Cauſe,</hi> ſaith our Author, is the judging of <hi>Chriſt</hi> internally in Individuals, and the <hi>Effect,</hi> that wherever this judging is experienced, there is ſuch a Ceſſation from all War, <hi>A good Tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not forth corrupt Fruit,</hi> Luke vi. 43. But <hi>War</hi> is a corrupt Fruit, becauſe it hath Luſt for its Original.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Very true, <hi>Offenſive War</hi> is ſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that are pious will not bring forth ſuch Fruit; as our Author well obſerves; No! but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; and this, methinks, ſhould be in <hi>Works,</hi> as well as in <hi>Words.</hi> I am ſo far from a Deſire of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening our Author's <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to <hi>ſinful War,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Offenſive,</hi> that I heartily wiſh it was much <hi>ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and that he might get ſuch Light, as to concur with others in Preparation to cruſh that <hi>Cockatrice,</hi> under God, by main <hi>Force,</hi> if milder Meaſures will not do, which we ſhould be glad they would, and ſo prevent the Neceſſity of <hi>ſhedding human Blood;</hi> this is a Diſpoſition truly ſublime, as he juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Author</hi> offers the <hi>Jewiſh Objection</hi> againſt my <hi>Opinion, V. p.</hi> 35. which he is pleaſed to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce with an Air of <hi>Diſdain;</hi> how will our <hi>mighty Pleader</hi> for <hi>War</hi> anſwer this Objection? Mr. <hi>S.</hi> has to Appearance uſed ſlighting <hi>Terms</hi> in ſeveral Parts of his Performance, this <hi>Sermon-writer,</hi> &amp;c. not conſidering, perhaps, that he is guilty likewiſe of that <hi>awful Crime</hi> as well as me, ſince he has enter'd into an <hi>Offenſive War</hi> againſt me; and in this Place, by
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:006247_0096_10282129A6CC53C8"/>
the Figure <hi>Antiphraſis,</hi> he repreſents me as very weak!</p>
            <p>Well, I own the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of his <hi>Charge,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any <hi>Defects</hi> that may attend this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> are to be aſcribed thereto; and if there be any thing of a different <hi>Kind,</hi> it is to be aſcribed to the Kindneſs of a gracious <hi>God,</hi> and the goodneſs of my <hi>Cauſe,</hi> that have helped a <hi>weak Inſtrument!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, as to the <hi>Jewiſh Objection,</hi> ſo far as I can ſee, his Opinion does not in the leaſt weaken it, for as much as the Prophecy reſpects a <hi>national Peace,</hi> which does not obtain; and therefore what becomes of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> if it certainly intends an external as well as internal Peace, as an immediate Conſequent of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s coming?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our <hi>Author</hi> finds Fault, <hi>V. p.</hi> 35. with my ſaying that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſubdues Mens Corruptions in a <hi>Meaſure;</hi> he would have had me to have omitted theſe Words, in a <hi>Meaſure;</hi> but I aſſure him, that I don't know how to leave them out, nor does he do ſo, as to himſelf, in his <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For Humility and Meekneſs, ſaith he, are quite oppoſite to <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Fighting,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Pride and Covetouſneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Very juſt, and therefore we ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in others, that Monſter, <hi>Offenſive War;</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our <hi>Author,</hi> as I conceive, doesn't oppoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in <hi>Degree;</hi> there ſeems to be his great <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>'</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Author</hi> is pleaſed to query, Does not the Intimation, that the <hi>Goſpel received in the Love of it,</hi> only in a <hi>Meaſure</hi> ſubdues Mens Corruptions, <hi>imply a Deficiency in the Power?</hi> And can it be conſiſtent with our Lord's Doctrine, <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To the former Queſtion, No! I'll make bold to take himſelf for an Inſtance. In his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:006247_0097_1028212D44C79E18"/>
he acknowledges <hi>that he has not yet attained, nor is already perfect:</hi> I am apt to think our Author ſpeaks the <hi>Truth</hi> here, and that his preſent <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> is a Proof thereof. Now, one of theſe two Things follows from theſe two Paſſages of our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;</hi> either that he has not received the <hi>Goſpel</hi> in the <hi>Love</hi> of it; or that his Imperfection argues no Deficiency of Power in <hi>God</hi> or his <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No! the Wiſdom of <hi>God</hi> appears in ſuffering our preſent State to be attended with <hi>Defects;</hi> hereby conſtant Occaſion is given for Self-abaſement, prizing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and continual <hi>Dependence</hi> upon him, as well as longing for that Time and Place, when and where <hi>that</hi> WHICH IS PERFECT SHALL COME, <hi>and that which is in Part, ſhall be done away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bringing in <hi>Poole</hi>'s Annotations, to patronize the Doctrine of <hi>Perfection,</hi> is no Argument that our Author has attain'd it himſelf; for it is an <hi>Attempt</hi> to make him ſpeak contrary to his real <hi>Sentiments</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>See his Annotations upon 1 <hi>John</hi> xviii. <hi>If we ſay that we have no Sin, we deceive ourſelves, and the Truth is not in us.</hi>
                     <q>If we either profeſs it as a Principle, or think in our Minds, or do not bear in our Hearts, a penitential remorſeful Senſe, correſpondent to the contrary Apprehenſion—<hi>We deceive ourſelves, i. e.</hi> The Frame and <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Goſpel <hi>Doctrine</hi> (as 2 <hi>John</hi> i. 2.4) cannot be duly entertain'd, lies not evenly and agreeably with itſelf in our Minds, or hath no Place with Effect in us, as <hi>John</hi> viii. 37.'

            <p>In <hi>V. p.</hi> 37, 38. our <hi>Author</hi> propoſes this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <q>When the <hi>Flame</hi> of an unjuſt <hi>War</hi> broke out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Followers of Chriſt, did they reſiſt? did they defend themſelves?

            <p>I anſwer, That our <hi>Author</hi> changes the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> in the aforeſaid Particular; there is a wide Difference between <hi>private Perſons</hi> ſuffering <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> upon a <hi>religious Account,</hi> with Meekneſs, which is their <hi>Duty,</hi> and a <hi>Nation</hi>'s ſuffering tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Enemy to <hi>rob</hi> them of their <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi>

upon a <hi>civil,</hi> which is their <hi>Sin!</hi> This <hi>Fallacy</hi> being removed, the <hi>Sermon</hi>'s <hi>Concluſion</hi> ſtands good.</p>
            <p>But to return from this <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> which I have been led into by Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> I ſhall beg Leave to offer ſomewhat more upon the <hi>Prophecy</hi> aforeſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> ii. 4. Suppoſing that the <hi>Deſign</hi> thereof was outward <hi>Peace,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> when Neceſſity requires, does not oppoſe it, for this only allows the <hi>Liberty</hi> of uſing <hi>Force,</hi> in Caſes of Extremity, after all mild Meaſures are uſed, and prove ineffectual; and in the mean Time incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, a <hi>peaceable loving Temper</hi> of <hi>Mind</hi> towards others; now how can that hinder <hi>Peace,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates it upon the Good, and conſtrains the Bad to it, by Arguments of <hi>Fear?</hi> or, in other Words, how can that hinder <hi>Peace,</hi> which promotes it?</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are truly pious, are ſo diſpoſed to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> that they do not give Cauſe for <hi>War,</hi> by their Conduct; No! it is the Wicked and Impenitent who <hi>oppreſs,</hi> and thereby give <hi>Cauſe</hi> for <hi>Defenſive War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it appears, that in order to promote a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Peace,</hi> there is no Need of Mens quitting the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Defenſive War;</hi> no, but only of a <hi>Change</hi> of the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>wicked Men;</hi> for it is from them, that that <hi>Monſter</hi> of <hi>Offenſive War</hi> proceeds!</p>
            <p>If a <hi>peaceable Diſpoſition</hi> cannot conſiſt with the Doctrine of <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> then it will follow, that thoſe <hi>pious People</hi> before the <hi>Law,</hi> and under the <hi>Law,</hi> that held it, which they all did, ſo far as we know, were not of a peaceable Diſpoſition; but the latter is falſe, and therefore the former. Was not <hi>Abram</hi> of a <hi>peaceable Diſpoſition,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and a Multitude of others, of whoſe <hi>Piety</hi> we have the infallible Teſtimony of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 13.

My Soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth Peace. I am for Peace; but when I ſpeak, they are for War!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can any Now-a-days, who are for the Doctrine of <hi>paſſive Obedience,</hi> and abſolute <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> pretend to exceed <hi>Abram</hi> in <hi>Faith, Moſes</hi> in <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Joſhua</hi> in <hi>Integrity,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in holy <hi>Zeal</hi> and Deſires after <hi>Peace?</hi>

                  <hi>It is probable our Author tho't he ſhou'd make his Objection too ſtrong, if he had given the Reaſons which the Text u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for enforcing Obedience to theſe Doctrines,</hi> That ye may be the Children of your Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil, and on the Good, and ſendeth Rain on the Juſt, and on the Unjuſt—Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven is perfect.</q>

            <p>And yet our <hi>Author</hi> elſewhere, <hi>p.</hi> 31. approves of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>'s <hi>Office,</hi> and the Execution of it, in puniſhing Tranſgreſſors, in theſe Words; <q>And the Truſt repoſed in the <hi>civil Power,</hi> for the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Evil-doers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> faithfully diſcharged, we ſhould be ſo bleſs'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> To reconcile theſe Things together, I freely confeſs, vaſtly exceeds the Reach of my Underſtanding!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. In Anſwer to what I had ſaid in the Sermon, <q>That if the aforeſaid Scripture, <hi>viz. Mat.</hi> v. 44. be taken in a literal Senſe, going to Law is as much contradicted thereby, as <hi>Defenſive War;</hi> but the former is abſurd, and therefore the later.</q>
               <hi>S. p.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> anſwers in the following Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Where is the Abſurdity? There are many pious Chriſtians, that look upon the Precept to extend thus far, and therefore do not ſue at Law at all:
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:006247_0107_1028215A5B893D78"/>
And if there are others who think it may be done, without contradicting the Text, provided it be done in Uprightneſs, and without any Hatred, Malice, or Revenge: Yet the Practice of theſe, doesn't in the leaſt make void the Authority of the Precept, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               <hi>V. p.</hi> 40, 41.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, that the aforeſaid Anſwer ſeems to me to be very ſtrange and evaſive; for 1. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> aſſerts, that there are many pious Chrſtians, who look upon the Precept to extend thus far; how far pray? why ſo that they do not ſue at Law at all; <hi>i. e.</hi> if our Author wou'd ſpeak out, they think it wrong for them to go to Law, and ſo incur the Abſurdity mentioned in the <hi>Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>If there are others, ſaith our <hi>Author,</hi> who think it may be done, without contradicting the Text, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet the Practice of theſe, doesn't make void the Authority of the Precept, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Theſe Expreſſions are ſo dark and dubious, that it is hard to come at our Author's Meaning, which ſeems to be this, that there are ſome Chriſtians by Profeſſion, whoſe Sincerity he queſtions, that think they can ſafely go to <hi>Law,</hi> and if they do ſo, with a right <hi>Temper</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> it doesn't leſſen the Authority of the Precept afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
            <p>From this Paragraph, I would obſerve two Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our <hi>Author</hi> ſeems to queſtion the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous State of all thoſe that go to <hi>Law;</hi> this Senſe his Words in their Connection eaſily bear; which is ſcant <hi>Charity,</hi> and not very conſiſtent with his own Approbation of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>'s <hi>Office!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He allows that Perſons, who think it is right, may go to <hi>Law</hi> without <hi>Hatred,</hi> and if ſo, why not with ſuch a Diſpoſition to <hi>Battle</hi> for their <hi>Defence?</hi> And ſo his Cauſe is in Effect given up!</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:006247_0108_1028215C3ADA6030"/>3. Our <hi>Author</hi> doesn't tell us, which of the two Companies aforeſaid he is of himſelf, which it was but proper for him to do. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. Is borrowed from Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, V. p.</hi> 41. whole Words are theſe, <q>For it is as eaſy to reconcile the greateſt Contradictions, as theſe Laws of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with the wicked Practices of <hi>Wars</hi>—Whoever can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile this, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil,</hi> with reſiſt Violence by Force, may be ſuppoſed alſo to have found a Way to reconcile <hi>God</hi> with the <hi>Devil, Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> Light with Darkneſs, and Good with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Reaſoning concludes well againſt <hi>Offenſive War,</hi> between which and <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Mankind,</hi> as well as <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> there is doubtleſs an unreconcilable Contradiction!</p>
            <p>But ſeeing <hi>Defenſive War</hi> is contrary to <hi>Offenſive,</hi> in <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> as well as <hi>Manner,</hi> it muſt needs therefore be agreeable to <hi>Love, Goodneſs,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Precept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> intends by the aforeſaid Reaſoning, to ſignify, that both <hi>Offenſive</hi> and <hi>Defenſive Wars</hi> are contrary to the <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I may juſtly turn his own Argument againſt himſelf, and ſay, whoever can reconcile theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, <hi>viz.</hi> Offenſive and Defenſive War, (and reconciled they muſt be, before they can join in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Love,</hi> the <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Temper</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>) may be ſuppoſed alſo to have found out a Way to reconcile <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Devil, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt, Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs, Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr, <hi>Barclay</hi> was doubtleſs a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> but ſeeing he was but a <hi>Man uninſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:006247_0109_1028215E04B1C458"/>
he might be miſtaken in ſome Points, as well as other Men.</p>
            <p>If we take the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> in the former Senſe, we have him for a <hi>Patron</hi> of <hi>Defenſive War;</hi> but if in the latter, he is inconſiſtent with himſelf, and runs into the ſame unſurmountable Abſurdities, which he reproves others for, without Foundation!</p>
            <p>Our Author proceeds to confute a Paſſage in the <hi>S. p.</hi> 30, 31. where I ſay, <q>That killing of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, is more conſiſtent with <hi>Love</hi> to them, than <hi>Self-murder</hi> is with <hi>Love</hi> to ourſelves;' the Reaſon of which I there repreſent to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> A greater Degree of <hi>Love</hi> we ſhould bear to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hence this Concluſion is drawn, that when the Safety of others and our own come in Competition; we muſt rather ſecure our own.</q> Well how does our <hi>Author</hi> confute this? Why, in the following Manner, <hi>V. p.</hi> 43.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But are either of theſe Caſes in the leaſt Degree conſiſtent?—Are they not rather as oppoſite as Eaſt to Weſt? A Man can never deſignedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure what he really loves, and it is his Duty to love Enemies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that the aforeſaid <hi>Anſwer</hi> ſhifts the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and leaves out en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the <hi>Reaſon</hi> upon which my <hi>Argument</hi> is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed; <hi>e. g.</hi> The Queſtion is not whether we ſhou'd <hi>love</hi> our Enemies, and avoid <hi>killing</hi> them, as much as can conſiſt with our own <hi>Safety</hi> (for that I had frequently aſſerted in the <hi>Sermon,</hi> ſee p. 28, 29, 30) but whether we ſhou'dn't <hi>love</hi> ourſelves in a <hi>greater Degree,</hi> and in Conſequence hereof, when their <hi>Lives</hi> and ours come in Competition, ſo that one muſt be loſt, we ſhou'd rather ſecure our own. This Foundation of my Argument he drops entirely. At this Rate of proceeding, our <hi>Author</hi> may with Eaſe confute any <hi>Book,</hi> that ever was compoſed!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:006247_0110_1028216985BDC1D0"/>But our <hi>Author</hi> proceeds to ſay, <hi>V. p.</hi> 43. as follows; <q>The Paragraph in p. 31. wherein the <hi>Sermon-writer</hi> undertakes to prove, that no more is meant by Chriſt's Command to <hi>love</hi> Enemies, than was enjoined under the <hi>Jewiſh Diſpenſation,</hi> is (in my Opinion) a Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Pray <hi>Sir</hi> cool a little; <hi>Sophiſtry;</hi> why ſo? Cannot be reconcil'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Why ſo? Where is the Proof?—Here we have warm Words, and nothing elſe!</p>
            <p>But becauſe great <hi>Streſs</hi> in this Argument is laid by the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the other Side of the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> upon the aforeſaid Words of our <hi>Saviour, againſt reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil, Mat.</hi> v. which I think they miſunderſtand, I will therefore take the Liberty to enlarge more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this important Part of the Argument.</p>
            <p>And here let me enquire, if the Words of <hi>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Evil,</hi> be taken in their ſtrict, literal Senſe, without <hi>Limitation,</hi> then why not the following <hi>Precepts</hi> about <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>borrowing?</hi> Either all ſhou'd be underſtood abſolutely and literally, or none of them.</p>
            <p>Is it not unreaſonable to imagine, that we ſhould be obliged, by the <hi>Laws</hi> of Chriſtianity, to give to one that aſk'd, that we knew either did not need it, or in all Probability would make a bad Uſe of it, or to give without our being able to afford it, to the Prejudice of our <hi>Families?</hi> In one of theſe Caſes we ſhould encourage another in <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and ſo be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of their Sins; and in the other, oppoſe a juſt, natural Affection to our <hi>Families,</hi> and ſo, as the Apoſtle obſerves, be <hi>worſe than Infidels!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Man by an unjuſt <hi>Law-ſuit</hi> takes away our <hi>Coat,</hi> is it reaſonable to take this Paſſage of <hi>giving

him our Cloak alſo</hi> in a literal Senſe? Isn't this to encourage him in Wickedneſs, not only to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <hi>paſſive</hi> under the Wrong, but to give him as much more of our Goods gratis? Can it be thought the <hi>Laws</hi> of an allwiſe <hi>God,</hi> rightly underſtood, wou'd thus fight againſt each other? Shou'dn't we interpret Scripture according to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> in ſuch a Way as to make it Self-conſiſtent?</p>
            <p>If the following <hi>Precepts</hi> do oblige to <hi>give</hi> and <hi>lend,</hi> at the meer <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of the <hi>Aſker,</hi> or <hi>Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> without any Regard had either to their Wants; or our Abilities, then their <hi>Luſts</hi> or unreaſonable Deſires, are to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of our Proceeding in the aforeſaid Points, and not <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and if the Caſe be ſo, how then is <hi>Religion a reaſonable Service?</hi> How then can we order our Affairs with <hi>Diſcretion?</hi> How then can we be ſaid to have any <hi>Property</hi> in our <hi>Goods,</hi> ſeeing we are obliged, upon the aforeſaid <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> to <hi>give to every Aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Borrower, and not to turn away?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An impudent <hi>Beggar</hi> may come an hundred Times in a Day, or more, and clear us of all our <hi>Caſh;</hi> an unreaſonable <hi>Borrower</hi> may come as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſtrip our <hi>Houſes</hi> in the like Space, ſo that we ſha'n't have a <hi>Stool</hi> to ſit on, or a <hi>Bed</hi> to lie on; and may they not alſo, in the like Space, ſtrip our <hi>Perſons,</hi> ſo that we ſha'n't have a <hi>Rag</hi> to cover us?</p>

            </p>
            <p>Well, if to avoid the aforeſaid Conſequences, the <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Giving</hi> and <hi>Lending,</hi> muſt be taken in a limited, reſtrained Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſignify a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, beneficent Temper and Diſpoſition of Mind, regulated in its Exerciſe by Reaſon, judging of our own and others Circumſtances, ſo as not to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all we have, to <hi>lazy Lurches,</hi> ſturdy <hi>Beggars,</hi> unconſcionable unmannerly <hi>Borrowers;</hi> then why ſhou'dn't we take the <hi>Precept</hi> about <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> in a limited Senſe too? Isn't the <hi>Reaſon</hi> the ſame, the <hi>Form</hi> of Expreſſion the ſame, and the abſurd and perilous Conſequences more than equal? Or are our <hi>Perſons</hi> leſs worth protecting, than our <hi>Caſh</hi> or <hi>Goods?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to add, that there is nothing annexed to this <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>Giving,</hi> which intimates a <hi>Reſtriction,</hi> but it is only to be inferr'd by the <hi>Dictates</hi> of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Equity;</hi> whereas the <hi>Precept</hi> reſpecting <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> has its <hi>Explication</hi> adjoin'd, which implies a <hi>Limitation,</hi> viz. that of <hi>Smiting us on the Cheek,</hi> which can intend no more than ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and tolerable Injuries; is it not therefore exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unreaſonable in any, to Hold the Limitation of the former, and not of the latter?</p>
            <p>Moreover, to illuſtrate this Caſe yet further, let it be obſerved, that we are commanded by our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>

in the ſixth Chapter of <hi>Matthew, To take no Thought for To-morrow, what we ſhall eat, or what we ſhall drink, nor yet for our Bodies, what we ſhall put on, ſeeing that God, who clothes the Lillies, and feeds the Sparrows, will abundantly provide for his Children, who are much better than many Sparrows.</hi> The Form of Expreſſion here is as <hi>abſolute</hi> as the other about <hi>not reſiſting Evil;</hi> and yet if it is taken literally, without any Limitation, it deſtroys at a <hi>Stroke</hi> all human <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> all prudent Foreſight; for have the <hi>Lillies</hi> and <hi>Sparrows</hi> any of theſe?</p>
            <p>Now, if the aforeſaid <hi>Precept</hi> be taken abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, can any <hi>Merchant</hi> carry on his Buſineſs? Can he, without any Thought of To-morrow, buy <hi>Bills,</hi> and ſend them to <hi>England?</hi> Send Veſſels to Sea, and never think of the Time of their return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>Or can a <hi>Shopkeeper</hi> carry on his <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Goods,</hi> without any Thought of ſelling them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? Or ſell them, without any Thought of the Time of Payment? Or if he did ſo, would it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? Muſt not he ſhut up Shop?</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Tradeſman</hi> muſt not think of To-morrow, how ſhall he inform his <hi>Cuſtomers</hi> when they may expect their Work? Or if they want ready Money, how ſhall he tell them of a Time of Payment?</p>
            <p>And how can a <hi>Farmer</hi> carry on his <hi>Huſbandry</hi> according to this Notion?

            <p>Now, that <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Fighting</hi> are in ſome Caſes <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>civil Government,</hi> appears both from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> hence a <hi>Sword</hi> is aſſigned, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and he is ſaid <hi>not to bear it in vain; i. e.</hi> when he acts up to his <hi>Office,</hi> he is, as the Apoſtle obſerves, <hi>a Terror to Evil-doers, a Revenger to execute Wrath,</hi> and that in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to <hi>Bloodſhed</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> upon him that <hi>doth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> Rom. xiii. Now, if theſe Things do not imply <hi>Force,</hi> what does?</p>
            <p>All acknowledge that <hi>Laws</hi> are neceſſary to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> now, can theſe be put in Execution upon <hi>Criminals</hi> always without <hi>Force,</hi> without <hi>Fighting?</hi> Then certainly they are grown much better hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of late than formerly!</p>
            <p>What has come to paſs, may again, in the like Circumſtances. Does not Hiſtory inform us of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Tumults</hi> and Inſurrections that have been? And in ſuch Caſes, if the <hi>Sword</hi> be not drawn, and uſed, will not the Magiſtrate be trampled under Foot, his <hi>Office</hi> contemned as a ſilly <hi>Cypher,</hi> all <hi>Order</hi> be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, <hi>Juſtice</hi> perverted, <hi>Property</hi> unhinged, and a univerſal <hi>Chaos</hi> ſucceed, in which the <hi>Honours,</hi> the <hi>Goods,</hi> the <hi>Lives</hi> of the Innocent, are made a <hi>Prey</hi> to lawleſs and rapacious <hi>Violence!</hi> If a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> pronounces <hi>Sentence</hi> againſt a <hi>Criminal,</hi> and no Force is to be uſed for the <hi>Execution</hi> of it, would not the Criminal, in all Probability, eſpecially if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of this, inſult him with the greateſt Rudeneſs,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:006247_0116_1028217DD459D2D8"/>
               <hi>kick</hi> him and <hi>cuff</hi> him on the <hi>Bench,</hi> for daring to offer ſuch an Affront to a Perſon of his Dignity and Extraction?</p>
            <p>Suppoſing, what has often happened, that a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, legally condemned, ſhould fly from <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and refuſe to be taken, and, being <hi>armed,</hi> would declare that he would not be taken alive, what is to be done in this Caſe? Is <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> to be uſed or not, to bring him to Puniſhment? If not, then civil <hi>Laws,</hi> and civil <hi>Government,</hi> are but a meer <hi>Sham,</hi> not worth a <hi>Ruſh,</hi> for the <hi>Protection</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> and <hi>Execution</hi> of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> a poor, contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> of no <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> a fit Object for <hi>Deriſion</hi> and <hi>Ridicule!</hi> If yes, then <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> are lawful to defend <hi>Property,</hi> and execute <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which is the Point in Queſtion!</p>
            <p>But what if the Number of <hi>Villains</hi> be greater, who join in Confederacy to affront <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to wrong a Community, either in their <hi>Lives</hi> or <hi>Properties,</hi> or both; does not it neceſſarily follow, upon the ſame <hi>Plan</hi> of Reaſoning, that a greater <hi>Force</hi> of Men in Arms be ſent to bring them to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</hi> For can the <hi>Number</hi> reaſonably exempt them from the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of the Law, ſeeing it does not leſſen the Crime of each? No! but on the contrary their Confederacy encreaſes their Crime, as well as the <hi>Danger</hi> of the publick <hi>Safety;</hi> and therefore they muſt be oppoſed in Arms, except it be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that leſſer Crimes ſhould be puniſhed, but not greater; leſſer Dangers guarded againſt, but not greater; which, if it be not abſurd, I know not what is!</p>
            <p>Well, has a <hi>foreign</hi> Enemy any better <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>rob</hi> and <hi>murder</hi> us, than <hi>Rogues</hi> of our own <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> If yea, let it be produced; if nay, then why ſhould not we oppoſe them with equal Care and Force, in order to maintain the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>King,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If the forming of good <hi>Laws,</hi> and annexing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Penalties</hi> to them, be agreeable to <hi>God,</hi> and good Men; why not the Execution of thoſe <hi>Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> upon <hi>Delinquents,</hi> without which they are but inſignificant <hi>Scarecrows,</hi> of no Moment or Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p>If we regard good <hi>Laws,</hi> is this Regard well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, by our tamely ſuffering them, without Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to be trod under Foot, and conſequently the Government and Privileges built upon them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned and deſtroyed!</p>
            <p>Pray what is <hi>civil Government,</hi> but the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Individuals,</hi> for the effectual <hi>Protection</hi> of <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> from <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Violence?</hi> What is it but a <hi>Union</hi> of many, to do that for the publick <hi>Good,</hi> which is not in its own <hi>Nature</hi> ſinful for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons to do, who are not united to <hi>Society,</hi> but what they frequently have not <hi>Power</hi> to do; to remedy therefore this Inconvenience, is the <hi>Deſign</hi> of <hi>ſocial Union,</hi> whereby a ſufficient <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> is by common Conſent treaſured up, for the Good and <hi>Security</hi> of all the Members of that <hi>Body;</hi> which <hi>Power</hi> is to be uſed to the aforeſaid valuable <hi>Purpoſes,</hi> upon proper Occaſions, as the publick <hi>Managers</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that Perſons who are <hi>wronged,</hi> or in Danger of being ſo, and unable to right or guard themſelves, reaſonably fly to the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and <hi>Protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I think is a juſt Repreſentation of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of <hi>civil Government;</hi> and therefore I ſee not how it is poſſible for the Wit of Man to reconcile to it the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of abſolute <hi>Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi> for if it be unjuſt in itſelf for a <hi>private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="unknown:006247_0118_1028218C98501F00"/>
to <hi>reſiſt</hi> in all Caſes, it muſt be ſo alſo for a greater Number, as our <hi>Author</hi> has well obſerved, <hi>V. p.</hi> 39, 40. It muſt be ſo likewiſe for the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;</hi> for a <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Individuals</hi> can never alter the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Things,</hi> or make that which is in itſelf <hi>unjuſt,</hi> to be <hi>juſt,</hi> as our <hi>Author</hi> fairly reaſons in the aforeſaid Pages, but from a falſe <hi>Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can the <hi>Almighty,</hi> to ſpeak with Reverence of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> in a Conſiſtency with the <hi>Purity</hi> and Perfection of his <hi>Nature,</hi> give <hi>Authority</hi> to do what is in itſelf <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>unjuſt;</hi> and therefore this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence eaſily and unavoidably follows, That <hi>civil Government,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of abſolute <hi>Non-Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> are <hi>Aſuſtata,</hi> incompatible, irreconcilable <hi>Contradictions!</hi> And likewiſe,</p>
            <p>Hence it follows, that ſuch as are for any one of them, muſt, if they would conſiſt with themſelves, give up the other.</p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Colourings</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Addreſs,</hi> the <hi>Subtleties</hi> of <hi>indefinite Terms, Evaſion</hi> and <hi>Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> may caſt a <hi>Miſt</hi> of ſeeming <hi>Confuſion</hi> over theſe plain Things, ſo as to miſlead the Unwary, Partial, and Injudicious; but they can never blend them together, or really weld them into one Piece, without a <hi>Botch</hi> that may be diſcerned without the Help of <hi>Spectacles!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may add, that ſuch who think it ſinful to <hi>reſiſt</hi> in any Caſe, and yet approve of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>'s <hi>reſiſting</hi> in ſome Caſes, do virtually approve of, and thereby become acceſſary to what they themſelves condemn as ſinful; which, whether it be either inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or conſiſtent, let the Reader judge.

            <p>Give me leave to offer a Word to our Author, by Way of Query, reſpecting divers uncharitable Sentences in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> SOME of which I have mentioned in this <hi>Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> Isn't judging the <hi>States</hi> of others, on Account of a ſuppos'd or real <hi>Miſtake</hi> in <hi>Principle,</hi> reſpecting Things not <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Chain</hi> of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the 14th Chapter of his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> and in very Deed, a <hi>Degree</hi> of real <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for <hi>Religion?</hi> And does this <hi>Perſecution</hi> conſiſt well with <hi>paſſive Principles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing that vaſtly the greater Part of the Chriſtian <hi>World</hi> are for <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> and many of them live ſober and regular Lives, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with experimental <hi>Religion,</hi> and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they have herein the Concurrence of all the Reſt of <hi>Mankind,</hi> does it look ſo decent and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like as cou'd be wiſhed, to treat them with an Appearance of <hi>Slight,</hi> and to condemn their <hi>States?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no Doubt a great Duty to depend on divine <hi>Providence,</hi> in the regular Uſe of all appointed Means; but if we may, without <hi>Preſumption</hi> and Impunity, depend in the Neglect of one Mean,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:006247_0121_102821926F2A5B28"/>
may we not, by a Parity of Reaſon, in the Neglect of more, and conſequently of all, and thus become intirely unactive, when we come to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Virtue;</hi> a ſtrange Sort of Perfection indeed, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Sloth</hi> and Indolence!</p>
            <p>But before I conclude this <hi>Reply,</hi> I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſider thoſe <hi>Inſtances</hi> which our <hi>Author</hi> has brought from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> for the Confirmation of his <hi>Opinion,</hi> and that with a ſufficient Degree of <hi>Confidence,</hi> that the <hi>primitive Church</hi> was upon his Side of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon this Point, I would obſerve, that I had not meddled with the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the <hi>Sermon</hi> he is pleaſed to animadvert upon, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the <hi>Merit</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> in Controverſy, does not depend upon their <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> but upon the Suffrage of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon:</hi> They were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Men as well as others, and had no other <hi>Rule</hi> to direct their Sentiments and Conduct, but what we have; no <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or human <hi>Authority,</hi> can alter the Nature and Reaſon of Things; or juſtly commend to our Eſteem and Acceptance, what is erroneus or abſurd!</p>
            <p>I have not mentioned theſe Things from any Diffidence reſpecting the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as tho' they were not for <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> No! But to fix the <hi>Streſs</hi> of the <hi>Controverſy</hi> upon its proper <hi>Baſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the Beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi> (if I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber right) in the <hi>Diſputes</hi> between the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the latter often urged, that the <hi>Fathers,</hi> together with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſhou'd be appeal'd to as determining <hi>Judges</hi> thereof, but the former juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected the Propoſal.</p>
            <p>After ſome Enquiry, I cannot yet find, that our <hi>Author</hi> had any Ground of <hi>Triumph,</hi> in Reſpect of the <hi>Fathers:</hi> However, after having offered my Reaſons, I freely leave this Point to the Judgment of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:006247_0122_1028219DEE7F4260"/>
the impartial <hi>Reader;</hi> to this End therefore let it be obſerved, That in order to have a juſt View of the <hi>Sentiments</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> concerning <hi>War,</hi> it is neceſſary, in my Opinion, to underſtand and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>The aforeſaid Particulars ſhed an eaſy Light upon the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> reſpecting <hi>War,</hi> and plainly prove, that thoſe Paſſages in them that ſeem contrary thereto, only intend their Averſion, either to the Method of propagating <hi>Religion</hi> by <hi>Force,</hi> or

before them, in the Cauſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that worthy pious <hi>Soldier,</hi> whom he baptiz'd without Rebuke; and probably together with him, that DEVOUT SOLDIER, of them that waited on him continually: Hence I would propoſe the following Queries, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1. Why does the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſpeaking by the Scriptures, put ſuch Honour upon <hi>Soldiers,</hi> even under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> if the Profeſſion be ſinful?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 2. Why were ſuch admitted to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or <hi>added to the Church</hi> by his infallible Direction, without any Profeſſion of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> for being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the military Buſineſs in Time paſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Promiſe of diſcontinuing in it for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? (See <hi>Acts</hi> x. 2, 7, 41) How can theſe Things be reconcil'd to the <hi>Purity</hi> of the bleſſed <hi>Spirit,</hi> and to the <hi>Government</hi> he has inſtituted in the <hi>Church,</hi> upon the Suppoſition of the Sinfulneſs of <hi>Defenſive War?</hi> Didn't groſs Offenders, that were baptized by <hi>John,</hi> confeſs their Sins firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were admitted to be Members of the Chriſtian Church by Baptiſm? See <hi>Mat.</hi> iii.6.</p>
            <p>If the military Buſineſs be ſinful under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> then <hi>Cornelius</hi> (the Prefect, or Captain over a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Soldiers, as the Word <hi>Ecatontarches</hi> ſignifies) and his <hi>Soldier</hi> Attendant, liv'd in a Courſe of Sin, which the Scriptures repreſent to be a Sign of a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable State, <hi>He that commits Sin, is of the Devil:</hi> Then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 3. How is it that both are honoured by an inſpired Perſon, with the Character of <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>pious,</hi> or right Worſhippers of God, which the Word (<hi>Euſebes a eu bene et ſebo colo</hi>) ſignifies? How can theſe Things conſiſt together?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Soldiers</hi> that ſuffered Torments and Death for the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> received the ſame <hi>Honours</hi> from

            <p>The following Words of eloquent and pious <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> are very memorable and full to this Purpoſe; <q>
                  <hi>Laurentinus</hi> and <hi>Ignatius,</hi> ſaith he, did heretofore bear ARMS in ſecular CAMPS, but in the mean time were true, ſpiritual <hi>Soldiers</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> while by the Concurrence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> they vanquiſhed <hi>Satan,</hi> they merited <hi>Palms</hi> of the LORD, and <hi>Crowns,</hi> by their illuſtrious <hi>Paſſion;</hi> we always make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Mention of them on every anniverſary Day, in which we celebrate the <hi>Memory</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs Paſſions</hi>

               <hi>Euſebius on the Life of Conſtantine, p.</hi> 69.</p>
            <p>This Inſtance clearly proves, that the primitive Chriſtians were for <hi>Defenſive War;</hi> this was the firſt Time of their being clothed with civil Authority as a <hi>State</hi> (and ſurely they could not act as a <hi>State</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were one) Now they had a <hi>Prince</hi> of their own <hi>Religion</hi> at their Head; now they could <hi>fight</hi> in <hi>Defence</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi> without complying with <hi>idolatrous Terms;</hi> and therefore this was the proper Time for them to declare their Opinion, and to act according to it, and this we ſee they did.</p>
            <p>Pray, where is there any Inſtance of a Chriſtian's refuſing to ſerve in the <hi>War</hi> in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Reign?

him to protect and defend us.</q>

            <p>Having premiſed ſuch Conſiderations as I tho't neceſſary, to enlighten the labouring Subject; I proceed to conſider the particular Inſtances, that our Author has adduced in Favour of his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of which is <hi>Socrates, V. p.</hi> 9. who is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Mr. <hi>S.</hi> as ſaying,
<q>That Injury is to be done upon no Account; nor if you have ſuffered Injury, are you at Liberty to take Revenge, as the Vulgar believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, that what <hi>Socrates</hi> ſays, is very juſt and true: Private <hi>Revenge</hi> in <hi>Society,</hi> in ordinary Caſes, or repelling Force by Force, is irregular and unjuſt, as I have before obſerved; and therefore this Inſtance is quite beſide the Point in Diſpute.</p>
            <p>Isn't it ſomething ſtrange, that our Author ſhou'd bring in a Sentence of that eminent <hi>Pagan,</hi> to condemn his known <hi>Practice;</hi> and uſe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's <hi>Magazine</hi> as his Voucher to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inſtance that our Author advances, is <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> a Chriſtian <hi>Father, V. p.</hi> 15. who upon theſe Words of our Saviour, reſpecting the two Swords that the Diſciples ſpoke of, <hi>It is enough;</hi> ſaith,
<q>O Lord, why commandeſt thou me to buy

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That even by our Author's Manner of citing <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s Words, the Cauſe I am defending, is proved by this Sentence,
<q>Unleſs perhaps a Defence be prepared;</q> pray what elſe is the Deſign of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> but the <hi>Defence</hi> of our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi> together with due Preparation for it; which the Sermon our <hi>Author</hi> oppoſes, was calculated to encourage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> or his <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> has not cited <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>'s Words fairly; which are theſe,

            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer; It is very true, the Prophecy is fulfill'd in its ſpiritual Senſe (in ſome Degree) by the peaceable Temper and Behaviour of Chriſtians towards each other, by their Averſion to all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt their rightful <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> and likewiſe by their Abhorrence of, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that Abomination, <hi>Offenſive War!</hi>

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 3. If the Chief Force of Chriſt's <hi>Precepts,</hi> the chief Weight of his <hi>Croſs,</hi> and of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> conſiſt in being freed as aforeſaid from <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Fatigue;</hi> then are not the Difficulties of Religion as light as a <hi>Feather,</hi> and very agreeable to the corrupt Inclinations of Nature, which verge to <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Eaſe?</hi>

            <p n="1">1. That he puts military and civil Offices upon a Par, and informs us that they were both queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd at that Time; I mean the Lawfulneſs of both; and no Wonder, ſeeing ſinful Terms were propos'd, ſuch as <hi>ſwearing</hi> by <hi>Hercules,</hi> or by the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s <hi>Genius,</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays in his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> was, in Effect, to give divine <hi>Honour</hi> to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils:</hi> He likewiſe obſerves, in the Words I have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the <hi>Oath</hi> of Fidelity to <hi>God,</hi> and to the Prince, were, under ſuch Circumſtances, inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent Things. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſpeaks not a Word of the Unlawfulneſs of <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> in its own Nature. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Words cited by our <hi>Author,</hi> muſt be taken in a reſtrained Senſe, as ſignifying Chriſt's prohibiting our Uſe of the <hi>Sword,</hi> at ſuch Times when it involves us in <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or endangers our Innocence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="unknown:006247_0170_1028226B633A18D0"/>The Senſe our Author puts upon <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Words, concludes as much againſt civil as military Offices,; for <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of both in the ſame Series of Diſcourſe, and ſhews that <hi>ſwearing</hi> by the Heathen <hi>Gods,</hi> and all Approaches towards <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> were equally unlawful in both: Beſides it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts what I have before cited from his <hi>Apology,</hi> where he <hi>prays</hi> for the Succeſs of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s <hi>Troops,</hi> and declares in the Name of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as their <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> that they <hi>bore Arms;</hi> nor does it agree with the general Scope of the Book upon <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> out of which it is taken; or with the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that immediately go before, and follow after; all which plainly direct to a limited Senſe.</p>
            <p>The next Paſſage from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has advanced, is from his Book againſt the <hi>Soldier</hi>'s <hi>Crown</hi> (the Occaſion of which has been before-mentioned) the Words are theſe;
<q>Can a Soldier's Employment be lawful, when Chriſt has pronounced, That he that uſes the Sword, ſhall periſh by the Sword? Can <hi>one who profeſſes the peaceable Doctrine of the Goſpel be a Warrior?</hi>
               </q> The Original Words, truly tranſlated, are, Shall a Son of Peace, be engaged in Battle? <hi>Et prelio ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabitur filius pacis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer that what goes before, and follows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Words our Author has cited, plainly ſhew, that they are to be taken in a reſtrained Senſe; and that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was not againſt <hi>Defenſive War,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a proper <hi>Authority,</hi> when it cou'd be carried on without incurring the Guilt of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> For thus he ſpeaks;</p>
            <p>
               <q>Nothing indeed is more unclean than <hi>Idols,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Crown</hi> is made a Thing ſacrificed to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,</hi> for truly by this Rite, Habit and Ornament, the Founders thereof did ſacrifice to an <hi>Idol;</hi>

D.</hi> 300, all <hi>Painting</hi> in <hi>Churches</hi> was prohibited, leſt that which was painted on <hi>Walls,</hi> ſhould be worſhipped; to this probably the Words of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> relate; who, as Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> informs us, flouriſh'd at this Time, <hi>Fleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s <hi>Eccleſ.

            <p>As to what our <hi>Author</hi> cites (from <hi>Barc. Apol.</hi>) of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> viz.
<q>That <hi>Chriſt</hi> teacheth a new Patience, even forbidding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging an <hi>Injury,</hi> which was permitted by the Creator; and <hi>Lib. de patien.</hi> That the Law finds more than it loſt, by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſaying. <hi>Love your Enemies. V. p.</hi> 44.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, that the Deſign of the aforeſaid <hi>Book,</hi> is to vindicate the <hi>Law</hi> againſt the Objections of <hi>Marcion.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays in it,
<q>That <hi>Juſtice</hi> is neceſſary to ſuppreſs <hi>Evil</hi>—If <hi>Injuſtice</hi> be <hi>evil, Juſtice</hi> muſt neceſſarily be <hi>good,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all the Effects of it, as <hi>Severity, Anger</hi> and <hi>Jealouſy</hi>—The <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God is prior to that <hi>Severity</hi> which Sin occaſioned; Puniſhment is an Evil in reſpect of him that ſuffers, inſomuch as it torments him; but good, inaſmuch as he is thereby corrected; and good abſolutely, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him who juſtly appoints it. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 2, 12, 13, 14, 16, 26. He obſerves that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> taught theſe <hi>Maxims, Take away all Malice from your Heart, learn to do well.</hi>—He likewiſe aſſerts, that the <hi>Law</hi> taught <hi>Charity</hi> and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Injuries. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 19. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>C.</hi> 16.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, it is evident, that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> can conſiſtently mean no more, by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Paſſages, than this, That the <hi>Goſpel</hi> forbids private <hi>Revenge,</hi> and recommends <hi>Patience</hi> and

            <p n="7">7th Inſtance our <hi>Author</hi> brings, is of the <hi>Emperor M. Aurelius Antoninus, V. p.</hi> 49. who ſays,

            <p n="2">2. That the Reaſon why he quitted the <hi>military Buſineſs,</hi> was not that he judged it ſinful in itſelf, of which there is not a Word in his whole Life; but becauſe from his Infancy he rather
<q>breathed after a divine Service;—when he was twelve Years old, he deſired a deſart or ſolitary Life, and had made a <hi>Vow</hi> to this Purpoſe; and hence he undertook the Life of a <hi>Soldier</hi> at firſt unwillingly,—and ſo embraced the firſt Opportunity that preſented of quitting it; which was this, while the <hi>Barbarians</hi> invaded <hi>France.</hi>

Obſerve, <hi>Reader,</hi> here are two Arguments of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Opinion in favour of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive War, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt, He acknowledges it to be <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>juſt:</hi> And 2d, <hi>Prays heartily</hi> for the <hi>Succeſs</hi> of <hi>Soldiers</hi> engaged in it.

farther to prove beyond all Contradiction, that it was held unlawful for a Chriſtian to bear Arms and to fight, not only in the Days of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> but later down, even to the <hi>Emperor Diocleſian</hi>'s Time: I ſhall produce the Teſtimony of one <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who ſuffer'd Death under that <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Reign, for refuſing to bear Arms. He frequently told the <hi>Proconſul, Dion,</hi> that he muſt not fight becauſe he was a Chriſtian.</q>

            <p>I anſwer, that this Inſtance, tho' plauſible and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, hath nevertheleſs, in my Opinion, no Force at all in it, to prove the Point our Author brought it for, if it be conſidered,</p>

Of this Kind I have mentioned many Inſtances in the preceding Pages, and a famous one juſt before this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By our <hi>Author</hi>'s Way of Reaſoning in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> I may prove with equal Force, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are againſt War and Fighting, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be an Evil contrary to their <hi>Religion E. G.</hi> In <hi>Dolabella</hi>'s Letter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> extant in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> deſired to be exempted from all <hi>military Expeditions. Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Theodore,</hi> being deputed from <hi>Hircanus,</hi> the <hi>High-prieſt</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> declared, That his Countrymen cou'd not engage in the <hi>Army,</hi> or bear <hi>Arms,</hi> on Account of obſerving the Rites of their own Law <note n="(r)" place="bottom">Antiq.

            <p>And in another Place he informs us, that when the <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded to depart from the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome liſted themſelves <hi>Soldiers,</hi> others were puniſhed for refuſing to do it, in Reverence

to the <hi>Laws</hi> of their <hi>Country.</hi> Now to uſe our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>'s Words, Do theſe prove beyond all Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that it was held unlawful for a <hi>Jew</hi> to bear <hi>Arms</hi> and to <hi>fight</hi> in theſe Days? Is this ſolid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning? Has it any Thing beſides <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance?</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Even in this Inſtance of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> we have the <hi>Proconſul Dion</hi>'s Teſtimony in our Favour, That among the Life-guards of <hi>Maximianus, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian, Conſtantius,</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> there were <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Soldiers</hi> who <hi>fought.</hi> And here I cannot but obſerve, that our Author's <hi>Reflections</hi> upon <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi>'s charitable Speech reſpecting the <hi>Soldiers</hi> that then bore <hi>Arms,</hi>
               <q>They know what is expedient for them,' are as inconſiſtent as uncharitable; for firſt he commends it, by ſaying, 'This is truly the very Language of a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi>' and afterwards oppoſes it in theſe Words, 'But what Sort of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> thoſe were, that <hi>Dion</hi> ſpoke of, that cou'd <hi>fight,</hi> we can only gueſs at; they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed bear the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Multitudes do Now-a-days.</hi>
               </q>—Here give me Leave to propoſe a few Queries. <hi>Query</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If our Author didn't like <hi>Maximilian</hi>'s chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Example, why did he commend it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 2. After he had commended it, why did he ſo directly contradict it, by condemning the <hi>States</hi> of thoſe <hi>Soldiers,</hi> which their Cotemporary <hi>Maximilian</hi> wou'dn't meddle with? And likewiſe by condemning the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Multitudes</hi> now, for the ſame Reaſon, <hi>viz. Fighting,</hi> or <hi>bearing Arms;</hi> for he repreſents both as Chriſtians in <hi>Name</hi> only: 'Tis true he ſoftens it a little by the following Words; but this doesn't wholly remove his cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Invective.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 3. Whether <hi>Uncharitableneſs</hi> be a good
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:006247_0186_102822A9265D4230"/>
Sign of a <hi>peaceable Temper,</hi> and of great Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Spirituality?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 4. Was it not a <hi>Blot</hi> in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheon,</hi> that when he fell into the <hi>Errors</hi> of <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> he had no Charity for any but his enthuſiaſtical Followers; and therefore wrote againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, under the Character of natural or graceleſs Perſons?</p>
            <p>I muſt freely declare, that upon a farther <hi>Inquiry</hi> into the <hi>Subject</hi> of this <hi>Debate,</hi> occaſion'd by Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Annimadverſions, I am more confirm'd in my <hi>Opinion</hi> than before; and cannot find any Thing in <hi>Scripture, Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Antiquity,</hi> to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the contrary.</p>
            <p>It is true divers <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of a private <hi>Character</hi> declin'd <hi>War</hi> in the primitive Times; but this is no Wonder at all, conſidering the <hi>idolatrous Terms</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon <hi>Soldiers</hi> by the Pagan <hi>Emperors;</hi> nor is it any Prejudice in the leaſt Degree to the Cauſe I defend.</p>
            <p>Yet I know of none of any Note in the Chriſtian Church, for the Space of Fifteen Hundred Years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that was of our <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>Opinion, viz.</hi> That <hi>War</hi> of every Kind is in itſelf a great <hi>Evil;</hi> yea, as much greater than private <hi>Revenge,</hi> as a <hi>Camel</hi> is to a <hi>Gnat.</hi> See <hi>V. p.</hi> 39, 40. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing ſome few might be found, of a ſingular and whimſical <hi>Caſt</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Self-contradictory,</hi> who were of our <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> can theſe turn the <hi>Stream</hi> of <hi>Antiquity</hi> retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, or diſannul the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of the Chriſtian <hi>Church?</hi> No, by no Means!</p>
            <p>And now to uſe Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Words, may I not ſay, that I have gone thro' the Arguments us'd in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> to prove the <hi>Unlawfulneſs</hi> of <hi>War?</hi>
