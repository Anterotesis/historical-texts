            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>"THE FILLE DE CHAMBRE," cried Mr. Puffendorf, the other day, as he took up the title page of my manuſcript (for, to own the truth, he caught me ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:) "Why, ſurely Madam, you do not think of troubling the Public with the adventures of ſo inſignificant a character?"</p>
            <p>I ſmiled, for I knew my good friend Puffend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rf imagined worth and virtue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely connected with birth, rank and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and that the actions of an obſcure individual, poſſeſſed of neither of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, could not for a moment be worthy attention. There was ſomething in my ſmile that rather offended him, ſo, without waiting for an anſwer, he thus proceeded:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:027651_0003_0FD5640B5D582948"/>"You are the ſtrangeſt woman upon earth! You pretend to blend in your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings both inſtruction and amuſement; but, in the name of common ſenſe, what inſtruction can be drawn from the life of an Abigail? Why, the whole muſt be a ſeries of intrigue, low wit, and frivolity."</p>
            <p>"Then, Sir, you muſt ſuppoſe ſhe lives with people in very exalted ſtations, and I write their memoirs, not her's."</p>
            <p>"No, Madam, no, I ſuppoſe no ſuch thing; for then your work might be worth reading. Perſons of high birth are as different from their inferiors, in their ſentiments and manners, as you can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly imagine."</p>
            <p>"I grant it, Sir, yet I hope you will allow, that the inferior in fortune is often the ſuperior in every other qualification."</p>
            <p>"Madam! Madam!" cried he, ſtriking the table in a paſſion, "you are enough to drive a man mad."</p>
            <p>"Do not miſtake me," I replied, mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; "I do not mean to inſinuate, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſenſe, or honour, are confined to any
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:027651_0004_0FD5640E70E72E28"/>
particular ſtation in life. I am fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that there are many exalted charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in this happy nation, whoſe amiable conduct, more than their elevated rank, render them objects of univerſal adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but, at the ſame time, you muſt give me leave to add, that the number is but very few, when compared to the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, the trifling, and the profligate, who form ſo large a part of our people of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. Virtue will appear amiable, tho' habited in the garb of poverty: and a woman may be an intereſting character<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' placed in the humbleſt walks of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and poſſeſſing no other recommendations than a feeling heart, and a ſtrong ſenſe of her duties, both moral and religious. Such a character is my FILLE DE CHAMBRE, the true child of nature; and as ſuch you muſt not expect to read of wonderful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, of titles, rank and wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unexpectedly heaped upon her. The only claim ſhe will have upon your attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall be her integrity and innocence."</p>
            <p>"It will never do," ſaid he. "take my
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:027651_0005_0FD564108D738EC8"/>
word for it; you will never get five ſhill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for your manuſcript."</p>
            <p>"I ſhall try it, however," ſaid I, as he went ſnarling down ſtairs; "nor ſhall ſplendor ever with me be a veil to cover guilt; vice and folly are fair game where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they appear, and cannot be too much held up to ridicule and abhorrence; nor ſhall meek-eyed virtue be ſuffered to ſink to oblivion; wherever ſhe dwells ſhe ſhall be greeted with ſmiles of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while the veil of humility ſhall be withdrawn from her heavenly countenance, that all may behold her tranſcendent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and, with a degree of glorious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, follow her faithful votaries."</p>

               <p>"BUT who knows, my dear father," cried Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca Littleton, laying her hand on that of her father, "who knows but ſomething yet may be done to reward a veteran grown grey in his country's ſervice?"</p>
               <p>"I hope there will, my child," ſaid Mr. Littleton; "and if there is not we muſt be content, for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, God bleſs him, cannot provide for all. I wiſh, my girl, it was in my power to convince him, that I am ſtill willing to ſight for him, though the bread I eat from his bounty is but brown: but with this poor ſtump," looking at all that remained of his right arm, "and this diſabled leg," ſtretching it out as well as he could, "all my ſighting days are over; I can only talk now, my child."</p>
               <p>"But you have fought bravely once," ſaid Mrs. Littleton, while a beam of exultation darted from her eyes.</p>
               <p>"And after all," cried Rebecca, "it is hard to be diſtreſſed for fifteen pounds."</p>
               <p>It was a clear froſty evening, in the beginning of January, when, in a little cottage, on the ſea coaſt of Lincolnſhire, Mr. Littleton, an old ſuperannuated lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in the army, his wife, daughter, and two of three neighbours, were comfortably ſeated round a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027651_0007_0FD56414CC1E3FC8"/>
cheerful fire, the brown jug was juſt repleniſhed by the fair hands of Rebecca, and the ſong, the joke, and the tale went cheerfully round, when an unwelcome though not unexpected, viſitor made his appearance, and threw a damp over their harmleſs mirth.</p>
               <p>This was no other than their landlord's ſteward, who came to demand the rent, in paying which they had been, from various diſagreeable reaſons, more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than uſual; it amounted to fifteen pounds, and the poor old man had no method whatever to raiſe the money. He had often made his diſtreſſes known to people in power, who had once ſtyled themſelves his friends, but never received any thing more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that ſomething ſhould be done; but hope had ſo often deceived him, that he now ceaſed to liſten to her flattering voice, and was ſinking into deſpondency, when the lovely Rebecca cheered him with the ſentence at the beginning of the chapter.</p>
               <p>Rebecca was the youngeſt of ſeven children, and the only one who lived to years of maturity. She was at this time juſt ſixteen, and had combined in her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon all the beauty of a Venus, and the ſimplicity of a Grace. She poſſeſſed a ſtriking figure, juſt tall enough to be elegant. Her ſhape was perfect ſymmetry, and her countenance one of thoſe which may ſafely be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced more than beautiful; for, to the ſofteſt blue eyes, flaxen hair, and a complexion that out-vied the lilies, was added ſuch an inexpreſſible look of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and candour, that it was impoſſible to ſee and not love her. She had been taught by her father to read and write her own language correctly, by her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome little knowledge of the French, and by the vicar's lady, who was extremely fond of her, ſhe had learned to play, with a conſiderable degree of taſte, on the lute; but being educated intirely in the family way, and never having paſt the boundaries of her native vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, except once or twice to a neighbouring fair, there was about her ſuch an air of modeſt timidity, that, by the unobſerving, might be miſtaken for ruſtic baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Though conſidered by her young companions as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>belle</hi> of the village, in her own opinion ſhe was ever the meaneſt, the leaſt worthy notice of any. Brought up in the ſtricteſt notions of the proteſtant religion, ſuch univerſal charity pervaded her ſoul, that ſhe never ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the worth and integrity of her fellow creatures; but implicitly believed, that every one, who profeſſed to love or eſteem her, ſpoke the genuine feelings of their hearts.</p>
               <p>She harboured no ideas which fear or ſhame prevented her revealing, for this reaſon, her actions, her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were often open to the malevolent miſconſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe, who, having art ſufficient to conceal the real impulſe of their natures, aſſume the ſemblance of thoſe virtues, the reality of which is poſſeſſed only by the genuine children of ſimplicity.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>In giving the character of Mr. Littleton, we require but few words; he was honeſt, poſſeſſed of valour, good ſenſe, and a liberal education.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Littleton was twenty years younger than her huſband, and was, when he married her, remarkably beautiful. She was the daughter of an exciſeman, and at a country boarding ſchool had picked up a fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>owy accompliſhments, but her mind had been totally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected; her ſentiments were therefore narrow and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal, and ſhe poſſeſſed that kind of worldly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which rendered her ſuſpicious of the integrity of every human being.</p>
               <p>The little knowledge Rebecca poſſeſſed of mankind, ſhe had gleaned from a ſmall, but not ill-furniſhed, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating library, to which all the inhabitants of the village ſubſcribed. Her mind was highly tinctured with the romantic, but withal was enlightened with ſuch a high ſenſe of honour, virtue and piety, that it was almoſt impoſſible to lead her to a wrong action; yet there were times when the fortitude of Rebecca was vulnerable. She could ſtand unmoved in a right cauſe againſt entreaty, perſuaſion, and even the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>We have ſaid that Mrs. Littleton had been handſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed, ſhe was ſo ſtill, being at this period but forty-ſeven

years old; for piercing black eyes, cheſnut hair, and a florid complexion, gave her greatly the look of youth. This juvenile appearance of her mother was a great misfortune to Rebecca, for Mrs. Littleton was ever more pleaſed with being told ſhe looked like her eldeſt ſiſter, than in being complimented with being the mother of ſo lovely a young woman; indeed, ſhe conſidered every compliment paid to her daughter as derogating ſomething from her own merit. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered her more as a rival than a child, and was happy in every opportunity to ridicule the feelings of a heart, of whoſe intriſic worth ſhe had no idea.</p>
               <p>Rebecca could not ſometimes help feeling the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs of her mother; but whatever thoſe feelings were, ſhe ſuffered in ſilence; no complaint ever eſcaped her lips, but ſhe endeavoured, by the mildeſt acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence in her every wiſh, to conciliate that affection which ſhe would have conſidered as her greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>"It is hard, indeed, to be ſo diſtreſſed for fifteen pounds," ſaid Rebecca: "I wiſh I could hit on any plan by which my dear father might be relieved from this embarraſſment. I have a great mind, if you will give me leave, to go to morrow morning to Lady Mary Worthy; I ſaw her laſt week at the vicar's when ſhe aſked me to come and ſee her, and ſaid ſhe ſhould be happy to render me any ſervice in her power."</p>
               <p>"And do you think ſhe really meant what ſhe ſaid?" cried Mrs. Littleton.</p>
               <p>"To be ſure I do," replied Rebecca.</p>
               <p>"Then you are a fool, retorted the mother, "not to take it, as it was deſigned, a mere compliment, which ſhe paid in reſpect to Mrs. Alton, who, ſhe ſaw, was rather partial to you."</p>
               <p>"Dear mamma," ſaid Rebecca, in an accent of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, "how can you think ſo? There was no neceſſity for her to aſk me, if ſhe had not wiſhed me to come, for, you know, I am greatly her inferior."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk ſo ſilly, child! do you ſuppoſe I wiſh every body to come to my houſe whom politeneſs obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me to aſk?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:027651_0010_0FD5641990BC8BC0"/>"I can only ſay, mamma, that I would never aſk any perſon whom I ſhould not be really glad to ſee when they came."</p>
               <p>"I think, my dear," ſaid Mr. Littleton (though I have the greateſt reſpect imaginable for your opinion) "that it would not be amiſs for Rebecca to go to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Mary; when ſhe knows our ſituation ſhe may be prevailed with to requeſt her ſon, Sir George, to wait till we can make up the ſum: I will, in the mean time, write to my old friend, Lord Antrim, perhaps, he may get my ſmall penſion enlarged,</p>
               <p>Mrs. Littleton remained ſilent, and it was agreed between Rebecca and her father, that the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe ſhould viſit Audley Park.</p>

               <p>AT twelve o'clock, next morning, the lovely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, habited in a plain white jacket, a ſtraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat, and black tereſa, ſat out for Audley-Park.</p>
               <p>Lady Mary was alone in the library when ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and, on the ſervant's announcing her name, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to be immediately ſhown up.</p>
               <p>"Now this is really kind," ſaid ſhe, with the moſt condeſcending ſmile, advancing to the bluſhing Rebecca, and taking her hand, led her to the ſofa on which ſhe had been ſitting, and ſeating herſelf by her ſide: "I flatter myſelf you are come to ſpend the day with me."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, madam," replied Rebecca, "I was not ſo preſuming as to hope ſuch an honour: I came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt—to entreat"— ſhe faltered—the tears ſtarted in her eyes —Lady Mary interrupted her.</p>
               <p>"Speak out, my love; do not be alarmed, but reſt aſſured, I am ready to grant you any favour within the limits of my power."</p>
               <p>"You are very good, madam. I hope you will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the liberty I have taken; but my father, madam

               <p>"Surely, my dear, your agitation is unneceſſary. I dare ſay my ſon has never thought of the rent."</p>
               <p>"No, madam, I do not ſuppoſe he has, it is ſo trifling; but Mr. Villars, his ſteward, aſked for it laſt night, and was very angry!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed! ſaid her ladyſhip; was he angry?"</p>
               <p>"I do not mean to complain of Mr. Villars, madam, for he has been very good to us, and often has waited a month or two for his money. You know, madam, he is only doing his duty when he demands it; for was he to be remiſs in collecting the rents, Sir George would certainly be offended with him."</p>
               <p>Lady Mary ſmiled at the eager manner in which Rebecca uttered this apology for Villars; but it was a ſmile of the utmoſt ſatisfaction, it convinced her of the goodneſs of her young viſitor's heart.</p>
               <p>"I think," ſaid ſhe, "if ſome friend could be found who would advance this ſum for your father."</p>
               <p>"Alas! madam, how is it to be repaid, unleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,"—heſitating, bluſhing, and riſing from her ſeat.</p>
               <p>"Unleſs what, my ſweet girl?"</p>
               <p>"Your ladyſhip would generouſly lend me the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and take me into your ſervice, that I might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der myſelf uſeful till it is repaid; or, if you think me too preſuming, madam, perhaps, you could recommend me to ſome family where there are children. I am not, it is true, accuſtomed to ſervitude, but I will exert my poor abilities cheerfully, and hope my willingneſs to oblige will, in ſome meaſure compenſate for my awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs."</p>
               <p>"You are too good, and too lovely," ſaid Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, "for a ſervant; but you ſhall, if you pleaſe, come and live with me. I will ſettle this little difficulty of your father's, and ſhall think myſelf obliged if you will accept a trifle annually for your pocket expences. She then drew forth her purſe, and preſented the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted maid with a twenty pound bank note."</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:027651_0012_0FD7C1D42B12A068"/>Grateful beyond the power of expreſſion, Rebecca could only ſink on her knees, preſs the hand of her benefactreſs to her lip, and, ſmiling through the tears that guſhed from her eyes, looked thoſe thanks ſhe found it impoſſible to utter.</p>
               <p>"Go, go, you are a ſimple girl I ſee," cried her ladyſhip, raiſing and puſhing her gently from her. "Go, make your father happy, and, if you can obtain his aſſent to my propoſal, to-morrow I will come and fetch you home; but I muſt have you mend that little heart of your's, it is but a very poor one to go through the world with."</p>
               <p>"It means well," replied Rebecca, trembling and confuſed, raiſing her timid eyes to the face of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactreſs.</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, I am ſure of that, but it is too honeſt by half; beſides, your intelligent countenance betrays its every emotion."</p>
               <p>"I hope, madam, it will never experience any, but may be revealed with impunity."</p>
               <p>"Ah! my dear," ſaid Lady Mary, ſhaking her head, "you will, no doubt, one day find that it will be to your intereſt to diſguiſe its feelings as much as poſſible."</p>
               <p>Rebecca, then took her leave, and as ſhe returned home, could not help thinking that it was very ſtrange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and very inconſiſtent too, that ſincerity ſhould be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>"WELL, Miſs, what ſucceſs?" cried Mrs. Littleton, as Rebecca entered the room: "I hope you are convinced I was right, in ſuppoſing your vanity incited you to hope without foundation."</p>

Lady Mary has received me kindly, and more than granted my requeſt."</p>
               <p>She then, with the moſt bewitching ſimplicity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated her interview at the Park, while Mr. Littleton looked exultingly happy; but good mamma contracted her brow, and, drawing herſelf up, as was her cuſtom when any thing diſpleaſed her, ſaid:</p>
               <p>"I hope, Mr. Littleton, you will not think of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the girl go: Lady Mary certainly does not mean to take her entirely, and it will only be filling her head with idle notions, of which, heaven knows, ſhe has plenty already. Beſides, what do we know of Lady Mary? It is true, ſhe came down here laſt year, and remained about three months; but who can tell any thing of her character and morals? She may lead the girl into all manner of folly."</p>
               <p>Now the caſe was exactly this: the late Sir George Worthy had purchaſed this eſtate but a few months before his death, and as Lady Mary was a woman of a very retired turn, the ſhort time ſhe remained in the country ſhe viſited but few families, and thoſe without ceremony. Lady Mary was truly benevolent, but ſhe performed thoſe acts herſelf, and not unfrequently made the ſilence and ſecrecy of the perſons benefitted, the only terms on which they were to hope a continuance of her favours.</p>
               <p>She in general reſided at a ſeat about twenty miles from London, to the end that ſhe might ſtrictly ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the conduct of a daughter who was married to a young diſſipated nobleman, and who, though bleſſed with a mother, whoſe example might have led her on to every laudable purſuit, was ſo entirely ſwallowed up in the vortex of folly and diſſipation, that ſhe had not time to attend to the eſſential duties of a wife, mother, and miſtreſs of a family.</p>
               <p>In the place where Lady Mary uſually reſided, ſhe was conſidered as a proud, unſocial woman, by the midling kind of gentry; by her equals as an oddity, and by her dependants as ſomething ſuperiorly good, and was by them beloved, reſpected, nay, almoſt adored as an angel of benevolence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:027651_0014_0FD56422AB44EB68"/>But Mrs. Littleton ſeldom gave people credit for virtues which ſhe had not the penetration to diſcover, though ſhe could eaſily imagine them capable of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing deceit, inhumanity, or almoſt any vice that can diſgrace human nature: ſhe therefore thus continued her diſcourſe to her huſband.</p>
               <p>"People are not always what they ſeem to be; this lady may make very fair promiſes, and when once the girl is in her power, treat her as a common ſervant. I beg Mr. Littleton, you will not let her go."</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry my dear love," cried Mr. Littleton, "to differ from you in my opinion concerning Lady Mary's offer; I think our dear girl will be highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in her friendſhip and protection.

I am as unwilling as you can be to part with her; but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſhe ſhould be in ſome way of earning a ſupport, and, I truſt, ſhe has ſenſe and fortitude ſufficient to withſtand every temptation to evil."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my father," cried Rebecca, taking his hand, "you may, indeed, depend on a child whoſe heart your precepts have trained in the love of virtue.

               <p>"My dear, you talk of things which never could enter my mind. I know you will always be happy to have your child with you, ſtrange if you were not, ſo amiable as ſhe is! But as I ſaid juſt now, I am growing old, I cannot remain much longer with you, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may marry again."</p>

               <p>Mr. Littleton was a man of ſenſe: he was pleaſed with Lady Mary's frankneſs, and readily conceived, that the propoſed retired ſituation of his child would be the only thing to ſhield her from thoſe ſnares and temptations to which a young woman is ſubject, who, poſſeſſed of beauty, wit, and ſenſibility, has neither rank or fortune to recommend her to the ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who might pretend to admire while, they lead the unſuſpecting innocent a victim to vice and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction!</p>

               <p>LADY MARY was not an early riſer; Rebecca had been accuſtomed from earlieſt infancy to leave her bed at ſix o'clock; ſhe had therefore aroſe at her uſual hour, and finding herſelf likely to be alone till ten o'clock, went into the library, and ſelected from among the many books there, Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon for her morning amuſement; the intereſting pen of Richardſon had ſo entirely charmed her attention, that ſhe thought not of time till Lady Mary made her appearance.</p>
               <p>"You have been reading, my love," ſaid ſhe; "are you fond of Novels?"</p>
               <p>"I like theſe entertaining Hiſtories, madam; they always command my attention, and awaken my ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility."</p>

               <p>"Far from it, child; human nature can never ariſe to ſuch a pitch of excellence as this Sir Charles Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon it repreſented to be; nor will you among your own ſex, be able to find a woman like Miſs Byron: beſides, if you accuſtom yourſelf to think theſe high wrote ſcenes real, you will find the actual occurrences of human life ſo flat and inſipid, that the very diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment will render you diſguſted with the world."</p>
               <p>Rebecca liſtened with attention, but ſtill in her heart ſhe thought, ſurely, theſe amiable characters, theſe intereſting ſcenes, are not all fiction.

It is eaſily in our own power to be happy, ſaid ſhe; but to render our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves really miſerable, requires much art, contrivance and ſolicitude: for, before we can be completely unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, we muſt forſake the commandments of our all-wiſe Creator; we muſt diſtruſt his merciful Providence, and render ourſelves totally unworthy his heavenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>But I am ſpeaking of her maturer reflexions, and forgetting that ſhe is but juſt entered on the grand theatre of life.—And to return:</p>
               <p>The time was now nearly elapſed which Lady Mary uſually ſpent in Lincolnſhire, which was two months before and one after Chriſtmas, at which period ſhe enlivened the hearts of all Sir George's tenants, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027651_0019_0FD5642CD1C1C6C0"/>
made the ſmile of tranquillity ſit on the countenances of age, and ſoftened the couch of pain and ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>And is not this the real incenſe to be offered at ſo glorious a ſeaſon? Will it not go up as a ſweet ſmell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſacrifice before the Moſt High?

               <p>It was with infinite pain that Rebecca parted from her father; nor did he experience leſs anguiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. "God preſerve you my child," ſaid he embracing her, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the happineſs of your poor father depends on your well doing."</p>
               <p>"Good bye, Rebecca," ſaid the mother; "God bleſs you, child, be careful, circumſpect, and wary; ſuſpect every one of a deſign on you till you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the contrary. You muſt think all men knaves, and all women treacherous, and then you will avoid many troubles. Truſt no one; keep your thoughts to yourſelf if you are unhappy, bear your ſorrows in ſilence, for no one will pity you if you tell them; the happy will only laugh at you, and the miſerable have enough to do to feel for their own afflictions. If you are happy, be ſilent alſo; for if you boaſt of your fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, ſome will ridicule the ſource from whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and others will, from envy, endeavour to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt that happineſs they cannot themſelves enjoy. Keep your thoughts to yourſelf; have few acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, fewer intimates, and no boſom friends. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a pretty word, but there is no ſuch thing as a true friend exiſting in the world. Remember what I ſay; the world is full of deceit, and ſilence and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion are the only things to ſecure you from its effects."</p>
               <p>"But ſuſpicion is incompatible with Chriſtianity," ſaid Rebecca; "we are taught to 'judge not that we be not judged."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Littleton looked at her daughter with an air of ſurpriſe, but remained ſilent. Lady Mary preſſed her hand, and led her to the chaiſe. Rebecca bowed to her parents, and before ſhe was from diſtance deprived

of the pleaſure of beholding them, the tears had effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually obſcured them from her view.</p>
               <p>Their journey was pleaſant, and the novelty of the objects ſhe encountered, in a ſhort time diverted her ideas, and before ſhe arrived at Twickenham ſhe was quite tranquil and happy; nay, ſhe was even more cheerful than Lady Mary had ever ſeen her before.</p>
               <p>It was late when they alighted; but the elegance of the houſe, the extent of the gardens, and the taſte in which they were laid out, was full and pleaſurable amuſement to Rebecca the next morning. Her own apartment commanded a view of the Thames and its delightful banks; ſhe thought ſhe ſhould never be weary of ſtanding at the window. "I will write my father an ample account of this charming place," ſaid ſhe; but when ſhe had rambled over all the pleaſure grounds, alas I thought ſhe, it will be impoſſible to give him an adequate idea of its beauties. I muſt even requeſt him to come next ſummer, and judge of it himſelf.</p>
               <p>For eight months, happineſs, pure, unallayed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, took up her abode in the boſom of Rebecca. She read, ſhe worked, walked, or played on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <head>CHAP. VI. WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED.</head>
               <p>TIME now flew on the ſofteſt pinions with Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; every riſing day brought increaſe to her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the tenderneſs and affection of Lady Mary hourly increaſed; ſhe had diſcovered in her gentle companion great taſte for muſic, and a dawning of genius for drawing.</p>
               <p>"Theſe are talents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" ſaid her ladyſhip, "that ever afford a fund of innocent amuſement to the poſſeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and it is certainly my duty, by cultivating them, to compenſate, in ſome meaſure, for the cheerful acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcenſe Rebecca ſhows to every deſire of mine, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in ſubmitting, without repining, to a recluſe life, which moſt young perſons, at her time of life, and poſſeſſed of her beauty and vivacity, would think cruel in the extreme."</p>
               <p>Lady Mary had received an education befitting her rank, and had not neglected the means of improving a very elevated underſtanding, and a bright natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, by refuſing attention to the ample means of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation which fortune held out; on the contrary ſhe made herſelf miſtreſs of the fine arts, muſic and paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to the moſt delicate and judicious choice of the works of fancy, ſhe added an extenſive knowledge of hiſtory and natural philoſophy.</p>
               <p>To her, therefore, the cultivation of ſuch a mind as Rebecca's was a ſource of the moſt refined pleaſure. She ſaw its beauties daily expand under her attentive care, with the ſame delight as the lapidary diſcovers the cruſt that envelopes the rough diamond give way to his labours, and the ineſtimable jewel aſſuming a degree of brilliancy that promiſes well to reward his induſtry.</p>
               <p>But, though the talents of Rebecca were thus eaſily drawn forth, and the ruſticity of her manners began to aſſume a more poliſhed air, it was impoſſible to alter the ſimplicity and purity of her mind. Whenever her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous patroneſs endeavoured to give her ſome idea of the manners of the world, ſhe manifeſted ſuch a degree of ſweet incredibility, when informed of vices of which ſhe had no idea, and was ſo ready to frame excuſes for errors of which ſhe imagined few could be guilty, and none intentionally, that Lady Mary was at length aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that nothing but experience would convince the innocent maid, but that every boſom was as free from guilt and treachery as her own.</p>
               <p>"My dear Rebecca," ſaid ſhe to her one day, "I will no longer labour to inform you of the vices and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of mankind, the total ignorance of which ſeems <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

ſhall be my care to leave you at my death an independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to prevent your charming unſuſpecting nature from buying experience at ſo dear a rate, as an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with, or a dependence upon, the ſmiles of an unfeeling, misjudging world."</p>
               <p>Thus Lady Mary determined; but, alas! like too many others, ſhe deferred, adding this codicil to her will from day to day, till a ſudden accident put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of her power.</p>
               <p>The autumn was now advancing, and Rebecca looked forward to the time when ſhe ſhould reviſit her native village. "And how will my dear father be delighted," ſaid ſhe, "to ſee and hear my improvements? To be ſure there is no harpſichord in his cottage; but he will ſurely come to the Park, and then I will ſurpriſe him by playing ſome of his favourite airs: my mother too, I will requeſt Lady Mary to let me give her that piece of grey luſtring ſhe ſo kindly brought me from town laſt week. I will buy her alſo a new cloak and bonnet; ſhe will be the gayeſt of all our neighbours next win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;" then taking out her port folio, ſhe ſelected ſome of her beſt drawings, and, in imagination, arranged them round her father's little ruſtic parlour.</p>
               <p>Lady Mary was that morning gone to Windſor on a viſit to an old acquaintance, and Rebecca, having amuſed herſelf in her own apartment ſome time, in the manner already mentioned, at length took up her lute, and opening a window which looked into a retired part of the garden, and into which darted the mild rays of a September's ſun. She tuned her inſtrument, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſinging the following little ſong, which ſhe had learned but a few days before; it was of conſequence a favourite from its novelty more than from its real beauty.</p>

               <p>While Rebecca was ſinging, ſhe had been ſo intent on her muſic, that ſhe had not obſerved any body enter the part of the garden to which her window looked; but on laying down her lute, and turning her eyes that way, ſhe perceived a young gentleman, in a riding dreſs, leaning againſt a tree, and gazing intently at her. The natural roſes that played on her cheeks were heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by this diſcovery.

               <p>"Sir!" replied Rebecca, with a voice and look of ſurpriſe, "did you ſpeak to me?" and ſhe involuntarily ſuſpended the hand that was raiſed to ſhut the window.</p>

to be obliged to quit the garden in ſuch a ſtate of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, eſpecially as he did not know who the young lady was: however he reſolved to ſtay at his mother's houſe a few days (a favour which he had never deigned before ſince the death of his father) for he imagined this fair viſitant would of courſe make her appearance at dinner, and that after the firſt formal introduction, he ſhould have the ſuperlative ſatisfaction of enjoying her company in an unreſerved family way.</p>
               <p>When Lady Mary arrived, ſhe was much ſurpriſed to ſee her ſon in the drawing-room; but as ſhe had not the remoteſt idea of his having been arrived long, after the firſt ſalutations were paſt, ſhe went to her own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſpatched Mrs. Harley, her woman, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Rebecca, that as ſhe had company, ſhe would order her dinner to be ſent up, and ſhould not expect to ſee her in the dining parlour.</p>
               <p>Harley was not ſatisfied with ſimply delivering her meſſage, but alſo delivered her own ſentiments on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>"Heaven keep me from pride," ſaid ſhe. "One muſt be blind, indeed, not to perceive the cauſe of my lady's confining you in this manner: mercy on us, as if fleſh and blood without a title was not as good as fleſh and blood with one! Marry come up, and were I to be judge, I think you are to the full as good as Sir George, mayhap better. All is not gold that glitters. I warrant ye, if Sir George was once to ſee your ſweet face, he would think a title well beſtowed."</p>
               <p>"I do not underſtand you, my good Harley," ſaid Rebecca, with a look of the utmoſt ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>"0h! it is all very well, Miſs; if you are ſatisfied I am; only I ſay it is a ſhame to ſhut you up ſo whenever Sir George comes."</p>
               <p>"Sir George!" cried Rebecca, eagerly; "is Sir George Worthy at Twickenham?" "Yes, Miſs Becky, he is and that is the reaſon."—</p>
               <p>"Hold, Harley; my lady's commands are ſufficient for me, without any reaſon alledged; but pray how long has Sir George been here?"</p>
               <p>"He arrived immediately on my lady's leaving

               <p>Harley muttered ſomething about inſenſible, and left the room.</p>
               <p>Lady Mary, having adjuſted her dreſs, repaired to the dining parlour, and ſent the butler to inform her ſon that dinner was ſerved. With a palpitating heart Sir George obeyed the ſummons; but how great was his ſurpriſe and diſappointment, on entering the room, to ſee no perſon there but his mother, and the cloth laid but for two! His chagrin betrayed itſelf in his countenance.</p>
               <p>"Do we dine by ourſelves madam?" ſaid he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confuſed.</p>
               <p>"That is an odd queſtion, George," ſaid her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. "I thought you was acquainted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe life I lead, and therefore could not expect to meet much company at my table."</p>
               <p>"Why that is true," ſaid he, endeavouring at an air of indifference; "but I thought ſometimes a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might drop in."</p>
               <p>He plainly perceived there was ſomething of a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and was too much a man of the world not to veil, as much as poſſible, the ardent deſire he felt to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate it; he therefore partook of the repaſt provided for his mother, and when the cloth was removed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her he intended ſpending a week or ten days with her, previous to her departure for Lincolnſhire.</p>
               <p>Lady Mary was rather ſurpriſed at this propoſal; but having long wiſhed for an opportunity to converſe with her ſon on a ſubject near her heart, namely, an union that had been for many years thought or between Lady Eleanor Harcourt, her brother's only child, and Sir George, for whom he had propoſed to beg the title of Earl of Chatterton, in reverſion, he being the only male branch remaining of the family: ſhe therefore ſatisfied herſelf with ſending an affectionate note <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Rebecca, briefly informing her of the cauſe that would occaſion their ſeparation for a few days, and aſſuring her ſhe would viſit her apartment the next morning, if opportunity offered.</p>
               <p>Rebecca ſighed as ſhe read the note; but ſhe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered herſelf it was a ſigh of pleaſure, for the happineſs her benefactreſs would enjoy in the company of her ſon.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the evening Lady Mary introduced the ſubject neareſt her heart, and endeavoured to divine the real opinion Sir George entertained of his couſin's perſon, merit and accompliſhments.</p>
               <p>He frankly acknowledged her a very amiable woman, a woman every way calculated to make the marriage ſtate happy: "But," continued he, "pardon me, my dear madam, if I ſay, I do not think myſelf, by any means worthy the hand of ſuch a woman. I am wild, and have ſeen ſo much of elegant refined beauty, that it is no longer an object of admiration. I can look on my couſin Eleanor, all lovely as ſhe is, without the leaſt emotion, except what proceeds from the affection I bear her as a near and worthy relation; but this is not the kind of affection neceſſary to form a happy marriage. My heart has ever been unmoved by real paſſionate love, and I do verily believe, if ever it is enſnared, it will be by the pure charms of nature, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated by art: I declare to you the enchanting <hi>naiveté</hi> of unaffected innocence would be to me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more captivating, than all the ſplendid charms of an elegant accompliſhed woman of faſhion."</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe the aſtoniſhment of Lady Mary upon this unexpected declaration of her ſon; it kept her for ſome moments ſilent.—"It is well," ſaid ſhe, mentally, "that I took thoſe precautions in regard to Rebecca; ſhe is exactly the woman to ſuit his taſte, and I ſhould have experienced the mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeeing my ſon reject a title and ſplendid fortune, and ally himſelf to obſcurity."</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:027651_0028_0FD5643B4E1D8298"/>"Oh! no," ſaid he, careleſsly; but why ſhould we talk on this ſubject now? Eleanor and myſelf are both young enough yet. Let her ſee a little more of the world; it is more than probable I may not be the man of her choice."</p>
               <p>"She will never have her father's conſent to marry any other; nor do I think he would ever forgive a ſtep of that nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can I ſay, George, that I ſhould eaſily overlook your preferring any other woman to Eleanor."</p>
               <p>"Upon my ſoul, my dear mother, this is a moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous idea! In the name of common ſenſe, why are two perſons, who experience nothing more than indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference towards each other, to be chained together, and ſeal their own miſery, to gratify the inclinations of thoſe, who, though they have a right to our utmoſt reſpect and obedience, aſſume an undue authority when they endeavour to controul us in a point ſo very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as the choice of a companion for life. I ſee you are offended, my dear mother; let me entreat you to pardon my ſincerity. Believe me, your happineſs is the firſt wiſh of my heart, and to promote it ſhall be the whole ſtudy of my life. It is to prevent you from future pain that I ſpeak thus, for, alas! what anguiſh muſt ſeize the heart of a parent, who, having forced a beloved child into a loathed marriage, ſees him plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in miſery, nay, perhaps, in guilt, from which ſhe has no power to extricate him: but let us not part in anger," continued he, riſing, and taking his mother's hand.</p>
               <p>"Be aſſured, ſhould inclination ever prompt me to an union with Lady Eleanor, every tranſport I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be heightened by the thought that it increaſed your felicity; but, ſhould it not, let not your diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure embitter the life of a ſon who loves you with the trueſt affection."</p>
               <p>He then kiſſed her cheek, and wiſhed her a good night.</p>
               <p>"He talks reaſonably," ſaid Lady Mary, as he left the room; "but it would grieve me to ſee the family of

               <p>SIR GEORGE had previouſly given his valet Le Brun an order to make inquiries obliquely concerning the fair recluſe, whom he had ſeen at the window in the garden, and now retired with the eager expectation of hearing ſomething of her.</p>
               <p>"Well, Le Brun," ſaid he, "what news? Can you learn whether the fair ſpirit of the garden haunts it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, or only ſometimes?"</p>

               <p>This was enough for Sir George. He diſmiſſed Le Brun, and determined to riſe by times himſelf, and join Rebecca in the garden.</p>

employed in reflecting on the unexpected incident which had thrown her in the way of the very man whom it was her intereſt to wiſh to avoid. "It was unfortunate," ſaid ſhe, "very unfortunate, that I ſhould have opened the window at that time; if Lady Mary was to know I had ſeen and converſed with her ſon, it would make her very unhappy, and yet how ſhall I ever be able to face her after having, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily, tranſgreſſed the only reſtriction ſhe thought fit to lay upon me? Will it not be beſt to watch the moment when ſhe retires to her apartment, to go to her, candidly confeſs the accidental rencounter, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deprecate the anger I muſt otherwiſe expect to encounter? Yes, it will certainly be right; my kind generous Lady Mary ſhall never have occaſion to accuſe me of want of ſincerity."</p>
               <p>When ſhe had formed this reſolution, her thoughts again reverted to the elegant accompliſhed manner, and fine perſon of Sir George, again in idea ſhe recalled every ſentence he had uttered, and innocently indulged the faſcinating reflexion unſuſpecting of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>The clock had juſt ſtruck eleven when Rebecca heard the footſtep of Lady Mary on the ſtairs. She heard her enter her dreſſing room, and then, with palpitating heart, preſented herſelf at the door of the apartment, and, by a gentle tap, demanded admittance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harley opened the door; pale, trembling, her eyes caſt on the ground, the agitated Rebecca entered, and courteſying, in a manner in which the ſoul ſeemed to bow more than the body, attempted an apology for the untimely intruſion.</p>
               <p>"Come in, my love," ſaid Lady Mary, then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her face ſhe continued. "Are you not well, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, or has any thing alarmed you?"</p>

               <p>"I am come my deareſt Lady," ſaid ſhe, riſing "to inform you, that I have, though undeſignedly, broken your injunctions, and incurred your diſpleaſure: let me, therefore Madam, expiate my offence, by being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from this delightful place, and from your truly valuable ſociety. Send me back, Madam, to my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble home; but, oh!

               <p>"You ſurpriſe me my dear child! I am at a loſs to comprehend your meaning.

Come, come, do not look ſo grave: I ſuppoſe this amazing fault, when revealed, will be diſcovered a very trifle. You have let my favourite ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary out of its cage, or you have broke one of the large India jars."</p>
               <p>"Ah! my dear Lady, worſe, infinitely worſe, I have ſeen Sir George. Now, pray do not look angry; indeed, he is the firſt and only perſon I have ſeen ſince my arrival here; nor did I ſeek the interview."</p>
               <p>"Do not alarm yourſelf thus, my love," ſaid Lady Mary, obliging her to ſit down again. "Come, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſpirits, and tell me ſincerely how it happened, what paſſed between you, and what you think of my ſon?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I think him," ſaid Rebecca, the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging young man I ever ſaw; he has ſuch a manly look, yet ſuch a ſoft air and voice."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" ſaid her Ladyſhip, gravely, "and pray what might he ſay to you?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! Madam, it would be vanity in me to repeat all he ſaid, he ſpoke ſo many fine things."</p>
               <p>"It is well Rebecca, I ſee you ſtill retain that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and ſincerity for which I ever loved you. I am fully ſatisfied that this interview was not ſought on your ſide, nor can I ſuppoſe it was on his. You ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain

a very favourable idea of Sir George, and I make no doubt but he does the ſame of you; but do not from this indulge any vain hopes that you can ever be any thing to each other. Young men of a certain rank in life, do not frequently match themſelves with their inferiors, yet they will leave no art uneſſayed to awaken ſenſibility in the heart of every woman whom they affect to admire. Will you make me one promiſe, Rebecca, and, without reſerve, ever remember to keep it inviolate."</p>
               <p>"Dear Madam, do you, can you, doubt me? Speak your commands; I am ſure they will not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and when I diſobey you, from that moment may peace and joy be ſtrangers to my boſom."</p>
               <p>"Then promiſe me, my dear, that you will never, directly, nor indirectly, liſten to any overtures of love which Sir George may make, or give him the leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; and while you keep the promiſe ſacred, may every earthly happineſs ſurround you; and ſhould you ever feel inclined to break it, reflect it is the only thing which you can do to wound the peace of a woman who loves you as her own child."</p>
               <p>"Then hear me, Madam," ſaid Rebecca, "while I ſolemnly proteſt, that never, while I retain my ſenſes, will I liſten to any profeſſion of love whatever from your ſon. The grateful affection I bear towards your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip will prompt me to keep this vow inviolable, had I no other motive; but, my dear Lady, I have two powerful reaſons for never infringing it. The firſt, I truſt you will believe, is an invincible repugnance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in my boſom to every thing derogatory to the dignity and honour of my ſex, and which will urge me to treat with ſcorn every overture that tended to the injury of either:—And for the other, pardon me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I feel my inferiority, nay, feel it ſo powerfully, that I will never meanly creep into a family who would think themſelves diſhonoured by the alliance."</p>
               <p>"My dear good girl," ſaid Lady Mary, embracing her, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of much felicity; beſides, my ſon is the deſtined huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of another."</p>
               <p>Rebecca heard her in ſilence, ſighed, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to leave the apartment. "Stay, my love," ſaid Lady Mary, "though you have charmed me by the frankneſs and candour of your behaviour, I am not ſatisfied, but that George will attempt to ſee you again; ſhall I requeſt my dear girl will keep intirely in her apartment to-morrow, and avoid going to the windows, and in the evening a chaiſe ſhall be ordered to the back garden gate. My own man James ſhall attend you, and you may proceed one ſtage on your journey towards Lincolnſhire that night. James will take particular care of you, and ſee you ſafe at your father's houſe, where you can pay them a ſhort viſit till I join you, which will be in about three weeks time." She then put a heavy purſe into her hand, bade her conſider it as her own, and then wiſhed her a good night: but calling her back, as ſhe was about to leave the room, ſhe deſired her to be careful what ſhe ſaid to Harley, and in particular to avoid mentioning her intended journey.</p>
               <p>"Is it pride?" ſaid Rebecca, as ſhe retired to reſt: "Or is it a tender wiſh for my felicity, that actuates Lady Mary? Surely it is the latter. Her liberality, her condeſcending affection, all tend to convince me it is my happineſs alone ſhe is ſtudious to preſerve: and never ſhall it be ſaid that Rebecca Littleton, like the ungrateful viper, ſtung the friendly boſom that warmed her into life; for, ſurely, the cultivation of our mental faculties, the enlargement of our ideas, is a ſecond, nay a better life than what we receive from nature, and this life I have received from my revered benefactreſs. What delightful ſources of pleaſurable amuſement has ſhe opened to my view! How ineſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the benefits I have received from her hand!

did not his mother ſay his deſtiny was fixed? May their felicity be as laſting as their lives! May every earthly bleſſing crown them! May heaven ſhower down its bounties on their heads, that their joys may render completely happy the heart of my kind, my generous Lady Mary!"</p>
               <p>Then lifting up her ſoul, in its nightly addreſs, to the Throne of Grace, ſhe blended the name of Sir George with that of his mother, and ſunk into that peaceful kind of ſlumber, which only innocence, like her's, can enjoy.</p>

               <p>SMALL was the reſt Sir George enjoyed that night, and ſoon as the morning peeped into his chamber he left his bed, and repaired to the part of the garden where Le Brun had informed him Rebecca uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally walked; but vain was this early attention, vain the anxious expectation in which he waited, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of his morning adoration did not make her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nay, even ſo ſcrupulous was ſhe of her Lady's injunctions, that ſhe kept the window ſhutters cloſed on the ſide next the garden, and only opened one that looked on a graſs plot that faced Lady Mary's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>The remainder of the day Rebecca ſpent in arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her clothes, &amp;c. for her journey; nor did ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, among her muſick, to put the new ſong, "It is certainly extremely pretty," and ſhe ſung it to herſelf all the day.</p>
               <p>Towards evening Lady Mary rang for Harley.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:027651_0037_0FD56448D30F8058"/>"Harley," ſaid ſhe, "I think you have a brother at Windſor. I have ordered a chaiſe for Miſs Littleton to take a ride this evening, therefore, if you like, you may go with her. Be ſat down at your brother's and ſtay all night. I will call for you to-morrow as I take an airing."</p>
               <p>Harley, who little ſuſpected the ſcheme that was in agitation, readily embraced this opportunity of viſiting her brother. She looked about for Le Brun, to inform him of her intended abſence; but Lady Mary had taken care to ſend him out of the way.</p>
               <p>Her Ladyſhip took a very affectionate leave of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, told her James had received every neceſſary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and again thanked her for the integrity of heart ſhe had ſo nobly ſhown it having no concealments from her, and promiſed her that her friendſhip, for herſelf and family, ſhould be manifeſted, even after her death. She then returned to the drawing room, and kept Sir George engaged in converſation till ſhe imagined Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca was departed.</p>
               <p>Sir George, though mortified by the return of his letter unopened, yet conceived great hopes from the account Harley gave him of their converſation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to watch carefully for an opportunity to ſee and perſonally plead his own cauſe to his fair enſlaver; but he cautiouſly concealed theſe thoughts from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he was far from imagining was, at that very moment, counteracting all his ſchemes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Rebecca continued her journey, and by noon, on the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cond day of her departure, ſhe found herſelf drawing very near her father's cottage.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" ſaid ſhe, "how ſurpriſed and delighted will the dear old gentleman be to ſee me arrive ſo unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly; nay, I think, even my mother will rejoice to ſee her child after ſo long an abſence:" then, in idea, ſhe ran over all ſhe had to relate to them. "And how my father will applaud my conduct!" ſaid ſhe, exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. "Surely there can be no pleaſure in this world equal to the applauſe of a parent whom we love, and whom it has ever been our ſtudy to obey."</p>
               <p>The chaiſe drew up to the door. She looked towards
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027651_0038_0FD5644A4FAD6998"/>
the parlour window; no one appeared. "I am afraid they are not at home," ſaid ſhe; but caſting her eyes up to the chamber, ſhe ſaw the window curtains cloſe drawn. At that inſtant Ruth, their faithful ſervant, appeared at the door.</p>
               <p>"Oh! dear Miſs," ſaid Ruth, in a tone of ſorrow, "I did not think you could have come ſo ſoon."</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" cried Rebecca, ſpringing from the chaiſe, and ſeizing the hand of Ruth, in breathleſs agitation.</p>
               <p>"Your poor father!" ſaid the ſervant.</p>
               <p>"Oh, God! my father is dead!"</p>
               <p>"No, my dear Miſs, not dead; but very—very ill."</p>
               <p>"Merciful heaven!" cried Rebecca, ſinking on her knees, with uplifted hands and ſtreaming eyes, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to my prayers, or let me not live to know his loſs."</p>
               <p>The tranſition was ſo great, from pleaſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſorrow, that ſhe could no longer ſupport it, but fainted in the arms of Ruth.</p>
               <p>On her recovery ſhe found her mother by her ſide. She threw her arms round her neck, wept audibly on her boſom, but could not ſpeak.</p>
               <p>"Ah! child, you may well cry," ſaid Mrs. Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, "for your father is not expected to live one hour after another."</p>
               <p>"Then lead me to him, dear mother; lead me to him, that I may receive his bleſſing, and catch his laſt ſigh. Ah! he muſt not die without a parting embrace to his Rebecca."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Littleton made no reply, but proceeded ſlowly up the ſtairs. Rebecca followed, and in a moment found herſelf by the bed-ſide of her almoſt expiring father. He put forth his hand; ſhe preſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d it to her lips, and ſunk in ſpeechleſs agony on her knees.</p>
               <p>"Do not lament thus, my dear child!" ſaid he faintly: "Heaven's will be done. I truſt you have found a protector in Lady Mary, and I ſhall go ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with that comfortable reflexion."</p>
               <p>"Protector! indeed," cried Mrs. Littleton, peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly; "heavy was the day when ſhe left her home for
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027651_0039_0FD5644BCD9D5230"/>
the protection of ſtrangers! I am ſure you have never been well ſince. This illneſs is all her fault. You have done nothing but pine and mope about, and if any thing happens it will all lay at her door; but ſhe was ſo eager forſooth to go, any where rather than home, ſhe was tired of the company of her old father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</p>
               <p>"Do not, my dear love," ſaid Mr. Littleton, "do not embitter my laſt moments by laying on the mind of this poor girl more than ſhe can bear. Behold her anguiſh, and pity it. Do not attribute my illneſs to ſo wrong a cauſe. My frame has long been decaying: I felt it myſelf, though I forbore to afflict your boſom by mentioning my apprehenſion."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my father," cried Rebecca; "I hope you will recover. I hope—."</p>
               <p>"Do not deceive yourſelf, my dear; my diſorder is a decay of nature, and a ſlow nervous fever, which the phyſician informed me yeſterday it was impoſſible to remove. I then deſired your mother to ſend for you; but tell me, my child, how is it poſſible you can have arrived ſo ſoon?"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" replied Rebecca, "I did not know you were ill till I arrived at the door. I came by my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's deſire to ſpend a few weeks with you and my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before ſhe comes into the country."</p>
               <p>"You have not offended her, Rebecca?" ſaid the father.</p>
               <p>"No indeed," ſaid ſhe, exultingly; "I am higher in her eſteem than ever."</p>
               <p>"Ah! ſo ſhe may tell you," cried Mrs. Littleton; "but I will anſwer for it ſhe was tired of your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or ſhe would never have ſent you away before her; ſo there is an end of your fine hopes, Miſs Becky."</p>
               <p>It was with the utmoſt uneaſineſs that Rebecca be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her mother thus prejudiced againſt her. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to recollect if any inadvertant expreſſion, in any of her letters, had given her cauſe of offence; and, in hopes to conciliate her good humour, ſhe, in the evening, opened her trunk, and preſented her mother with the ſilk before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:027651_0040_0FD564502B0440B8"/>She received it ſullenly, and laying it down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcarce deigning to look at it, ſaid, "This is no time to think of fine clothes, child, though in my heart I believe your thoughts never run on any thing elſe but dreſs, and faſhion, and nonſenſe."</p>
               <p>The truth was, that if Rebecca had a foible it was a paſſion for faſhionable dreſs; but this was never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to an extreme, and, though remarkably attentive to the decoration of her perſon, ſhe was never fine or tawdry.</p>
               <p>This ill-timed reproach of her mother's filled her eyes with tears, and ſhe retired to bed, but not to reſt, her father's illneſs, and the diſtance ſhe then was from her benefactreſs, were ſuch painful reflexions, that ſleep was a ſtranger to her eyes till the morning began to dawn, when ſhe enjoyed a few hours of compoſed ſlumber.</p>
               <p>Mr. Littleton's diſorder daily increaſed. He found his end nearly approaching, and frequently recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his daughter to preſerve, after his death, the ſame dutiful reſpect for her mother ſhe had ever manifeſted.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Littleton he did not fail to recommend a tenderneſs of behaviour, that might tend to invite the confidence of Rebecca. "You are too harſh with the poor girl," he would ſay; "treat her kindly: I am ſure you will find her deſerving of it."</p>
               <p>"I know her better than you do," was the conſtant reply, "and I know ſhe is an artful, deſigning girl."</p>
               <p>Mr. Littleton could not believe any evil of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, and died in her arms on the fifth day after her arrival, bleſſing her with his laſt breath.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. DISAPPOINTMENT.</head>
               <p>SIR GEORGE had not really determined in his own mind whether he would addreſs Rebecca on an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſcore, or merely endeavour to gain her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027651_0041_0FD56451D2BD9F68"/>
and then act as he ſhould find, from her manner and diſpoſition, ſhe deſerved.</p>
               <p>That day and the next he waited patiently in the hope of ſeeing her; but on the third, when Harley returned, (for Lady Mary did not bring her home till that time) how great was his ſurpriſe and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hear that Rebecca had been ſent for into the country to a relation that was ill; for Mrs. Littleton's letter arriving the day following Rebecca's departure, it ſerved as a ſufficient apology for her abſence, though indeed, Lady Mary did not think proper to enter into explanations with her woman, and rather miſled her, by mentioning Briſtol as the place where Rebecca's ſick friend was.</p>
               <p>Though Sir George had previouſly informed his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he thought of accompanying her into Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire, he no ſooner heard that the object of his purſuit had taken a different route than he determined to purſue her.</p>
               <p>"I have thought better of it," ſaid he to her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip; "I ſhall not viſit my tenants this year, for I have ſeveral engagements in town which I cannot well get off: beſides, I had forgot that I had promiſed a friend of mine to accompany him to Bath."</p>
               <p>"Ah! cried Lady Mary, exultingly to herſelf, "my good George, your journey will be in vain."</p>
               <p>In a few days Sir George left Twickenham, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſet out with poſt-horſes for Briſtol, where both himſelf and Le Brun were extremely diligent in their inquiries, though the reader may eaſily imagine to how little effect: however, he ſtill continued, and nouriſhed the hope, that chance would, by ſome means or other, diſcover to him the reſidence of the fair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, for as he could not ſuppoſe the ſituation of her friend very ſplendid, he thought it needleſs to inquire for her among people of faſhion; but he deſired his valet to be very minute in examining every houſe where they let lodgings.</p>
               <p>Three weeks had now clapſed ſince Rebecca's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and Lady Mary was preparing to viſit Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire, when, as ſhe was converſing with her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027651_0042_0FD5645356CD8640"/>
Lady Oſſiter, one morning, ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized with a fainting fit, which was ſucceeded by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, and left her ſo weak and low, that the faculty called in thought her life in imminent danger.</p>
               <p>Alarmed at this intelligence, ſhe deſired Harley to write immediately for Rebecca to return, and, calling for pen and ink, determined no longer to delay making the poor girl independent; but when ſhe took the pen and attempted to write, her faintneſs returned, and ſhe was totally unable to execute her purpoſe; but reſolved to do ſomething for her, ſhe called Lady Oſſiter to her, and thus addreſſed her:</p>
               <p>"There is a young woman, of the name of Littleton, who has been with me ſome months, though now ſhe is in the country. She is of a ſweet diſpoſition, and it was my intention to leave her at my death a thouſand pounds. I requeſt you, my child, to pay her this ſum, as ſoon as you conveniently can, after my deceaſe, and alſo give her my watch, a ſmall picture ſet with pearls, and this ring, taking one from her finger. I hope ſhe will arrive time enough to be informed from my own mouth of my intentions in her favour; but ſhould ſhe not, I truſt, you will not be neglectful of the deſire of a dying mother."</p>
               <p>It was with great difficulty, and many interruptions, that Lady Mary made known to her daughter this her requeſt Lady Oſſiter promiſed obedience; but, alas! Lady Oſſiter ſeldom remembered her promiſe, however ſacredly given. It was impoſſible to give Sir George notice of his mother's danger, for no one knew where he was.</p>
               <p>Lady Mary continued tolerably compoſed all that night; but the next day her fits returned, and ſhe expired in the evening.</p>
               <p>When Rebecca received the news of her benefactreſs's illneſs ſhe flew to Audley-Park. James was ſtill there. "Your Lady is very ill, James," ſaid ſhe; "I muſt ſet off immediately for Twickenham."</p>
               <p>"And I will attend you, Miſs," ſaid James, eagerly. "Only ſay when you will like to ſet off, and I will order the chaiſe."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:027651_0043_0FD56454CCBE0620"/>"I will go the moment you can procure one," ſaid ſhe. "I thought you would go with me, James, and, indeed, I ſhould be afraid to take ſuch a journey by myſelf; but do not order a horſe, my good James; we ſhall travel faſter if you ride in the chaiſe with me. I could not bear to have you hurrying after me on horſeback."</p>
               <p>James had lived with Lady Mary from the day of her marriage. He had ſerved his miſtreſs with the trueſt fidelity, and the tears guſhed from his aged eyes when he heard of her danger.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Littleton found Rebecca was determined to obey Harley's ſummons, ſhe conceived it was a high, an unpardonable breach of filial duty, for her to think of leaving a mother in ſo early a ſtate of widowhood.</p>
               <p>"You give me a great proof of your affection, Miſs," cried ſhe, ſcornfully, "to leave me in ſo much affliction, and fly poſt haſte after ſtrangers: however, we ſhall ſee who is moſt worthy your attentions by and bye. I ſuppoſe, when my Lady is tired of you again, you will be glad enough then to return to your mother."</p>
               <p>Though Rebecca was greatly hurt by theſe unjuſt reproaches, it did not prevent her intended journey, and ſhe ſet off that evening attended by James, and, indeed, in her own mind, firmly reſolved, that nothing but abſolute neceſſity ſhould ever oblige her again to viſit Lincolnſhire, except it was in the company of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Mary.</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening when ſhe arrived at Twick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enham, The ſad countenance of the domeſtic who opened the door, led her preſaging heart to fear the worſt.</p>
               <p>Harley met her in the hall, preſſed her hand in ſilence, and proceeded to light her to her uſual apartment.</p>
               <p>Rebecca hardly dared breathe as ſhe went up ſtairs; as ſhe paſt her Lady's dreſſing room, ſhe ſtopped, looked earneſtly at Harley, and, laying her hand on her heart, cried:</p>
               <p>"Tell me the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" but her reſpiration became ſo difficult ſhe could not finiſh the ſentence.</p>
               <p>"All is over," ſaid Harley.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:027651_0044_0FD564597A4A4D60"/>"I feared ſo," cried Rebecca; then turning into her own room, ſhe ſunk on the bed in a ſtate of ſtupid inſenſibility, from whence it was difficult to rouſe her.</p>
               <p>Harley uſed her utmoſt endeavours, and at length ſucceeded. Rebecca raiſed her claſped hands to heaven, exclaimed, "Thy will be done," and the ſalutary drops of ſorrow guſhed in a torrent from her eyes! Harley was pleaſed to ſee them flow, and imagining to leave her to the free indulgence of them would be beſt, retired to inform Lady Oſſiter (who had not yet left Twickenham) that Rebecca was arrived.</p>
               <p>"I will ſee her in the morning," ſaid her Ladyſhip, careleſsly. "Take her with you, Harley, to the houſe keeper's room."</p>
               <p>"She is in her own apartment, Madam. She never aſſociated with even the upper ſervants."</p>
               <p>"Oh! ſhe is quite the fine Lady I ſuppoſe. How could you endure the creature's pride, Harley?"</p>
               <p>"I never diſcovered that ſhe had any, Madam. She is the meekeſt being in exiſtence."</p>
               <p>"My mother uſed to ſay ſhe was handſome," cried her Ladyſhip, looking in the glaſs.</p>
               <p>"I believe every one thought her ſo who looked at her. Sir George was greatly ſtruck with her, though he ſaw her but once."</p>
               <p>"Well, ſo much the better; I ſuppoſe he will take the trouble of providing for her off my hands; eh, Harley, don't you think ſo?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Madam. I have often thought Miſs Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton would one day be Lady Worthy."</p>
               <p>"Woman!" ſaid Lady Oſſiter, turning haſtily round, with a look of the utmoſt contempt, "how could ſuch an idea enter your mind? Lady Worthy, indeed! No, I think George knows better than that; he may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, make her his miſtreſs: but go, good woman, go, you have made me quite ſick by the horrid ſuggeſtion."</p>
               <p>"Poor Rebecca," ſaid Harley, ſoftly, as ſhe left her imperious Lady: "Poor girl, you will ſee a ſad change I fear. You have loſt your beſt friend, and ſo we have all, indeed; for though my late dear Lady was proud ſhe never wanted humanity."</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. TEARS OF SENSIBILITY AND SORROW A-LA-MODE.</head>
               <p>WHEN the mind of Rebecca became a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, Harley prevailed on her to take ſome refreſhment. She took a few mouthfuls of boiled chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and drank a glaſs of wine, and then inquired in which room the remains of her revered benefactreſs lay.</p>
               <p>In her own dreſſing-room as yet," ſaid Harley; but to-morrow ſhe will be removed."</p>
               <p>Rebecca ſaid but little more, and Harley thinking the fatigue of her journey, and the agitation of her mind combined, might incline her to go early to reſt, removed the ſupper-table, and wiſhed her a good night.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was Rebecca alone than ſhe gave way to a freſh burſt of grief; the loſs of her father was again renewed, the unkindneſs of her mother was remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with double anguiſh, and her own friendleſs ſituation ſtruck ſo forcibly on her mind, that her ſorrow became almoſt inſupportable. At length her tears ſeemed exhauſted; a kind of torpid calm ſucceeded, and ſhe formed the reſolution of viſiting the chamber that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the deceaſed Lady Mary.</p>
               <p>With haſty and unequal ſtep ſhe reached the door of the apartment, opened it ſoftly, and pauſed for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſummon all her fortitude.—The attendants in the adjoining room heard her enter, and approached to conſole her; but ſhe waved her hand in ſilence for them to retire, and they reſpected her too much to attempt an intruſion on her grief, but left her to the free indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of it.—She placed the candle ſhe held in her hand on a table and approached the coffin, gazed, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential awe on that countenance, which had often beamed on her looks of the kindeſt benevolence.</p>
               <p>"Dear and only friend," ſaid ſhe, "ſince thou art gone, where is there a heart remaining that feels o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He ſtarted involuntarily at beholding Rebecca. Her penſive attitude, her depreſſed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance plainly depicted the ſorrows of her heart; the afflicted maid had not heard his approach. He drew near, and laid his hand on one of her's. She raiſed her timid eyes, looked at him mournfully, pointed to the coffin, and cried, emphatically:</p>
               <p>"She is gone for ever!"</p>
               <p>Sir George really loved and reſpected his mother; nor had he heard of her illneſs when the public prints an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her deceaſe. Shocked beyond meaſure, he inſtantly took poſt horſes, and never ſtopped, even for neceſſary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>She aroſe, preſented her cheek, was glad to ſee him, ſlightly mentioned the melancholy event, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſked him if he intended ordering a mourning coach, or only to put his ſervants in black? "I think," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, "the mournings are much ſhorter than they uſed to be, and nothing near ſo deep: I am glad of it: for my own part I deteſt mourning, it makes one look ſo dirty and diſmal."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:027651_0047_0FD56462333B6310"/>Juſt then Lord Oſſiter entered, and propoſed a game at cards, by way of whiling away the evening.</p>
               <p>"Ah! do join us, George," ſaid her Ladyſhip; "I have been moped to death this week paſt."</p>
               <p>"I am not in a humour for amuſement, ſiſter," ſaid Sir George, coldly; "and ſince you have no feeling yourſelf of the irreparable loſs we have ſuſtained, I ſhall not trouble you with mine, but retire where I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them uninterrupted."</p>
               <p>How great muſt be the contraſt then between this unfeeling ſiſter and the affecting ſenſibility of Rebecca! He preſſed her paſſive hand in ſilence, mingled his tears with her's, and found his heart inſenſibly relieved.</p>
               <p>"My poor mother," ſaid he, after a pauſe of a few moments, "little did I think when we parted it was the laſt time!"</p>
               <p>"She is undoubtedly happy," ſaid Rebecca, "in ſome meaſure, forgetting her own ſorrow, and wiſhing to convey conſolation into the boſom of Sir George."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I know ſhe is," replied Sir George; "if the practice of every virtue can inſure eternal felicity, ſhe is happy beyond what our weak imaginations can paint."</p>
               <p>Rebecca's tears ſtreamed afreſh.—"Ah! my dear mother," ſaid he, "your loved remains are embalmed by the tears of grateful affection, though thy daughter, forgetful of thy worth, can amuſe herſelf with trifles, and neglect the tribute due to thy memory."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" ſaid Rebecca, "I never can forget her— never wiſh it; for the remembrance of her virtues will emulate me in the attempt to imitate them."</p>
               <p>She preſſed her lips to thoſe of her clay-cold bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſs, faintly and tremulouſly pronounced the word "farewell!" and ruſhed haſtily out of the apartment.</p>
               <p>The next morning, at twelve o'clock Harley ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned her to attend Lady Oſſiter.</p>
               <p>On entering the dreſſing room, ſhe found her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip deeply engaged with her mantua maker and mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. She did not even notice the entrance of Rebecca but thus continued her directions to the former of her tradeſwomen:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:027651_0048_0FD5645E036D9040"/>"Let them be made as elegant and as full as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but, at the ſame time, remember, I wiſh to pay every neceſſary reſpect to my dear mother. It was a very ſudden thing. Mrs. Modily, you cannot think how it ſhocked me; my nerves will not be ſettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain this fortnight, I dare ſay; then, a thing of this kind forces one to be mewed up, and ſee no company, ſo I thought I might as well ſtay where I was as go to town. But, as I was ſaying, Modily, let my white bombazine be made very handſome, and full trimmed with crape: I do not mean to keep from viſiting above a fortnight, and, I think, in a month or ſix weeks I may wear white muſlin, with black crape ornaments, for undreſs."</p>
               <p>The accommodating mantua-maker agreed to all the Lady ſaid, when, turning round to ſpeak to her mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liner, Lady Oſſiter was ſtruck by the elegant perſon, and modeſt humble countenance of Rebecca.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I ſuppoſe," ſaid ſhe, careleſsly, "you are the young woman my poor mother mentioned in her laſt moments?"</p>
               <p>Rebecca courtſeyed aſſent, but was unable to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>"Ah! ſhe was very good to you, I underſtand. Well, don't make yourſelf uneaſy, I will be you friend in future."</p>
               <p>Rebecca attempted to expreſs her thanks; but her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſo violent, ſhe was forced to continue ſilent.</p>
               <p>"I dare ſay, child," ſaid her Ladyſhip, "you have ſome taſte in dreſs; come, give me your opinion about the caps I have ordered. Here, La Blond, ſhow her thoſe caps: well now, what do you think, will theſe be deep enough? for, though I hate mourning, I would not be wanting in reſpect; one's friends are apt enough to ſay ill-natured things; one can't be too cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in giving them occaſion. Do you think I ſhould go without powder? You look monſtrous well without powder; but then you have light hair, and your black dreſs, though ſo very plain, is becoming. Who are you in mourning for, child?"</p>
               <p>Rebecca was ſtruck almoſt ſpeechleſs with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:027651_0049_0FD5645F4CAECBB0"/>"Good heavens!" ſaid ſhe, mentally, "can this be the daughter of Lady Worthy?"</p>
               <p>"Who are you in mourning for, child?" ſaid Lady Oſſiter.</p>
               <p>"My father, Madam."</p>
               <p>"Oh! you have loſt your father. Well, it can't be helped, old folks muſt be expected to drop off. You muſt not be low ſpirited if you are with me: I hate low ſpirited people, though ſince I loſt my poor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have been low enough myſelf; but I endeavour to ſhake it off as much as I can; it is of no manner of uſe to grieve; when folks are once dead, we can't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal them, though we fretted ourſelves blind."</p>
               <p>"But we cannot always command our feelings, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," ſaid Rebecca.</p>
               <p>"No, child, that is true. I am ſure I often wiſh my feelings were not ſo delicate as they are; it is a great affliction to have too much ſenſibility. Pray what is your name, my dear?"</p>
               <p>"Rebecca."</p>
               <p>"Rebecca, that's a queer old faſhion name. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when my mother uſed to make me read the great Family Bible, I remember then reading about a Rebecca Somebody; but, Lord! child, 'tis a vaſt vulgar name; I'd alter it if I was you; one never hears of ſuch a name among people of any refinement."</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry it does not pleaſe your Ladyſhip," ſaid Rebecca, almoſt ſmiling at her abſurdity; "but as I was chriſtened by it I muſt be ſatisfied with it."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, Rebecca, but what is your other name?"</p>
               <p>"Littleton, Madam."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Lord! they are both three ſyllables—that is ſo tireſome. Well, but, Rebecca (for I like the name beſt on account of its oddity) ſhould you have any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to enter into my ſervice?"</p>
               <p>"Far from it, Madam; I ſhall cheerfully ſerve any part of the family of my dear departed Lady?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! but I am not quite ſo ſentimental as my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was: I ſhall not want any body to work and read by me. I ſhall want you to be uſeful; now for inſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Yes, Madam, and ſhall be happy to render myſelf uſeful in any thing within the compaſs of my power. I do not wiſh to eat the bread of idleneſs."</p>
               <p>Rebecca ſpoke with a degree of ſpirit that ſurpriſed Lady Oſſiter: however, ſhe unabaſhed, proceeded:</p>
               <p>"I have two little boys and a girl; I really have not time to attend them: now I could wiſh you to hear them read, give them ſome little knowledge of the French, and take care of Miſs Oſſiter's clothes. Can you make frocks?"</p>
               <p>"I make no doubt but I can, if I try, and my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours ſhall not be wanting."</p>
               <p>"That is well. I underſtand my mother did not ſuffer you to eat with the ſervants, ſo you ſhall have your meals in the nurſery with the children. I ſuppoſe, if my woman ſhould happen to be ill, or out of the way, you would have no objection to dreſs or undreſs me.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid I ſhould be awkward, Madam; but if you will pardon my want of experience, you ſhall always find me ready to obey your commands."</p>
               <p>"And what wages do you expect?"</p>
               <p>"Whatever you pleaſe."</p>
               <p>"What did my mother give you?"</p>
               <p>"I had no ſettled ſalary."</p>
               <p>"Well, but I like to know what I am about; I'll give you ſixteen guineas a year."</p>
               <p>Rebecca agreed to the terms, and, retiring to her apartment, left Lady Oſſiter to finiſh her conſultation with her milliner and mantua-maker—while ſhe took up her pen, and informed her mother that ſhe had entered into a new line of life, in which ſhe hoped to be enabled to do her duty, and gain the approbation of her Lady.</p>

made no attempt to ſee her, but ſatisfied himſelf with ſending every day to inquire after her health.</p>
               <p>"It is certainly a very improper time," ſaid he, "to think of entertaining her on the ſubject of love. Her heart is at preſent over charged with ſorrow; beſides I ſhould prove myſelf highly unworthy of her eſteem, could I, at this melancholy period, think ſeriouſly on any thing but the mournful cauſe of our meeting."</p>
               <p>The morning after the laſt ſolemn ceremony was performed, Sir George, ſitting at breakfaſt with his brother and ſiſter, mentioned that, in reſpect to his mother's memory, he ſhould remain at Twickenham a couple of months, and ſee no company, but one or two ſelect friends: he then invited Lord and Lady Oſſiter to remain with him during that period, and propoſed ſending immediately for the children.</p>
               <p>"You'll pardon me, brother," ſaid her Ladyſhip; "I cannot think of remaining any longer in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy place than till to-morrow, and I muſt ſay you are much to blame, in reſolving to bury yourſelf from the world: I am ſure it is a ſtep which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſo young a man."</p>
               <p>"You are to act as you pleaſe, ſiſter, and, I hope, you will permit me to do the ſame."</p>
               <p>"Oh! <hi>apropos,</hi> you know the young woman, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca—what's her name? I never can remember it. She that my mother kept with her as a kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion."</p>
               <p>"I have ſeen her," ſaid Sir George, "and cannot ſay but I am ſurpriſed my mother made no mention of her in her will; but, I ſuppoſe, ſhe deſired you to make ſome proviſion for her."</p>
               <p>"Yes, ſhe did mention her to me, and I have taken her into my protection."</p>
               <p>Here Lord Oſſiter, who had been careleſsly looking over the news-paper, laid it down.</p>
               <p>"So then," ſaid he, with an air of curioſity, "your Ladyſhip has taken her as a companion; but, pray, if that is the caſe, why is ſhe not at the breakfaſt table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſave you the trouble of making the tea?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! you labour under a vaſt miſtake, my Lord;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027651_0052_0FD564660C9A49B0"/>
no humble toad-eater will ever make a part of my houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. I aſſure you, I deteſt the whole claſs of them; they are in general a ſet of forward, impertinent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, made up of pride and idleneſs: I keep nobody about me but can render themſelves uſeful; and I know of no uſe your cringing companions are but to criticiſe their Lady's actions, and contribute to their Lord's amuſement."</p>
               <p>His Lordſhip looked diſappointed, and reaſſumed the news-paper.</p>
               <p>Sir George was perfectly aſtoniſhed at his ſiſter's ill-bred expreſſions; but willing to know in what manner Rebecca was provided for, ſimply aſked the queſtion.</p>
               <p>"Why, I have taken her into the nurſery to teach the children to read."</p>
               <p>"I approve the plan vaſtly," ſaid Lord Oſſiter, again laying down the paper: "I think the children wanted a governeſs."</p>
               <p>"Not ſo faſt, my Lord: I have as great a diſlike to governeſſes as to companions. I hate the whole claſs of your ſecond-hand gentry. Rebecca will hear them read—dreſs and undreſs Miſs Oſſiter—make her frocks —and upon occaſion, aſſiſt my woman."</p>
               <p>Sir George felt his cheeks glow with indignation. "I think, ſiſter," ſaid he, "conſidering the place ſhe held in our mother's eſteem, the ſituation you mean to give her is not paying that dear woman's memory a proper reſpect; beſides, I do not think it probable, after having been treated as the companion of Lady Mary, Miſs Littleton will feel herſelf ſatisfied with being only the ſervant of her daughter."</p>
               <p>"Don't make yourſelf uneaſy about that, George; I have talked with her, and agreed about terms: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if you chooſe to retain her here as houſe-keeper extraordinary," attempting an arch look,—</p>
               <p>"To cheer the ſolitary days of mourning," added his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>Sir George darted at them both a look of the utmoſt contempt. "Your inuendos," ſaid he, "are as cruel as they are groundleſs: however, Lady Oſſiter, you will pleaſe to know, that no perſon, who has been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured

by the friendſhip of my mother, ſhall be treated with diſreſpect, when I have the power to prevent it. If Miſs Littleton is not ſatisfied with her ſituation, I ſhall think it my duty to place her above it."</p>
               <p>"I will ſend for her here, and you may aſk her," ſaid her Ladyſhip.</p>
               <p>"Aye, that is the beſt way," ſaid Lord Oſſiter, ringing the bell; for from Sir George's evident agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he imagined there muſt be ſomething extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary about Rebecca, and earneſtly wiſhed to ſee her.</p>
               <p>"Tell Rebecca I want her," ſaid the Lady to the ſervant who entered the room.</p>
               <p>"For heaven's ſake, Lady Oſſiter," ſaid Sir George, "do not ſhock the poor girl's feelings, by ſending for her here."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Lord, ſhe muſt get the better of thoſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings you talk about, or ſhe will never be good for much; beſides, it always diverts me to ſee her bluſh, and look like a fool."</p>
               <p>"Rebecca Littleton can never look like a fool, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," cried Sir George, with vehemence, "and ſince you perſiſt in ſending for her, you will excuſe me if I do not ſtay to ſee Lady Oſſiter render herſelf ridiculous, by inſulting a woman every way her ſuperior, but in the paltry diſtinction of fortune."</p>
               <p>He then left the room, ſhutting the door after him with violence, and in a few moments Rebecca entered.</p>
               <p>How great was the ſurpriſe of Lord Oſſiter when he beheld the ſtrikingly beautiful figure that preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his view! Modeſty had recalled to her cheeks the roſy hue which grief had chaced from them. Her fine eyes were timidly raiſed from the ground to her Lady's face, while, with a gentle inclination of the body, and a voice of ſofteſt harmony, ſhe requeſted to know her commands.</p>
               <p>"Nothing particular, child; only I was mentioning to my brother the ſituation I had offered you in my family, and he thinks you will not be ſatisfied with it."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Madam, I am greatly obliged to Sir George for his ſolicitude, but muſt requeſt your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to inform him that while I can be ſo fortunate as

               <p>"Perhaps you would like to tell him ſo yourſelf, child?"</p>
               <p>"By no means, Madam."</p>
               <p>"But you are quite ſatisfied, Rebecca?"</p>
               <p>"Intirely ſo, my Lady, and that ſatisfaction will ever remain uninterrupted, while I am conſcious of performing my duty."</p>
               <p>"Well, that's all," cried her Ladyſhip, in a half peeviſh accent.</p>
               <p>Rebecca courtſeyed, and retired.</p>
               <p>"Well, and what do you think of her, my Lord," cried the Lady, turning to her huſband; "why you ſeem in amaze!"</p>
               <p>"I am perfectly ſo, my dear (endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect himſelf;) but it is becauſe I can't, for my ſoul, conceive what George can ſee in this girl to make ſuch a fuſs about her."</p>
               <p>"Why, don't you think her handſome?"</p>
               <p>"No woman appears ſo in my eyes when your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is by."</p>
               <p>"Oh! you're vaſtly civil this morning; but, pray what fault have you to find with her perſon?"</p>
               <p>"Nay, nothing particular; but I think ſhe is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inſipid."</p>
               <p>"She is very fair."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I was never ſtruck with your very fair women; they have not half the expreſſion of your fine brunettes."</p>
               <p>Lady Oſſiter was a very dark woman, and could not help at that moment going to the glaſs to adjuſt her handkerchief.</p>
               <p>"She has very fine eyes, my Lord."</p>
               <p>"Fine eyes, oh! ridiculous; you may as well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the blue glaſs beads ſtuck in the head of a wax doll. I don't ſee any thing about her even tolerably pretty but her neck and ſhoulders; they ſeem ſhaped well enough."</p>

                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:027651_0055_0FD5646C17B52B08"/>"This horrid mourning makes one look like a fright," cried the Lady, ſtill looking in the glaſs, "and they have made my gown ſo abominably high, I declare I appear quite round ſhouldered; it ſhall poſitively be altered before I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I too well know the diſpoſition of Lady Oſſiter to imagine a heart, like your's, replete with ſenſibility, can enjoy any tolerable degree of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, when ſubject to her caprice and ill-humour: I muſt therefore entreat my lovely friend to accept not from me, but as a legacy from my mother (for I am ſenſible ſhe deſigned it, though the ſudden ſtroke that deprived us of her prevented her putting her deſigns in execution) the encloſed two thouſand pounds, which will, at leaſt, place you above dependance on the weak and unworthy.</p>

               <p>Rebecca could not read this letter without emotion; yet did ſhe not heſitate what anſwer to return; the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter itſelf ſhe carefully locked up in her cabinet, but the bank-bills ſhe ſealed up in the following note:

                        <p>"Rebecca Littleton returns her moſt grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to Sir George Worthy for the kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude he evinces for her happineſs. She begs leave to return his noble preſent, which ſhe cannot think of

accepting, as it would lay her under an obligation too oppreſſive to a ſpirit which Sir George is miſtaken in thinking humble. Rebecca feels herſelf highly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the protection of Lady Oſſiter, and, though ſhe feels grateful for the offered friendſhip of the ſon of her ever-lamented benefactreſs, ſhe muſt beg leave to decline it, as the vaſt diſtance fortune has placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them renders it impoſſible to cultivate true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which can only ſubſiſt between perſons on an equality with each other.

                        <p>When ſhe had ſent away this note, ſhe again read over Sir George's letter; a tear, almoſt unknown to herſelf, fell on it as ſhe peruſed with attention his offers of friendſhip: but ſhe ſoon recollected herſelf, haſtily bruſhed away the token of her weakneſs, and, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the letter to her cabinet, began to prepare for her removal to town, whither Lady Oſſiter intended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the next day.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. TRIAL OF THE HEART.</head>
               <p>"WHAT a noble mind is here diſplayed!" ſaid Sir George, as he read Rebecca's note. "How much does this woman's ſentiments elevate her above the ſtation in which Providence has placed her! I fear my letter was not dictated with ſufficient delicacy; her pride has taken the alarm, that laudible pride that is a woman's beſt ſafeguard: but no matter, I will not write again, but wait till I can diſcover in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner my ſiſter behaves to her. When ſhe has tried her new ſituation, ſhe may not find it ſo eaſy as her little knowledge of the world at preſent leads her to imagine. When ſhe finds herſelf uncomfortable, then, perhaps,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:027651_0058_0FD564734DFE4298"/>
the offer of friendſhip from me will be more acceptable."</p>
               <p>In the evening Sir George, having no inclination to join the inſipid chat of Lord and Lady Oſſiter, pleaded letters to write, and went to the library to look for a book that might afford him an hour's rational amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As he entered the room, he ſaw Rebecca buſily employed in retouching a ſmall drawing that lay before her, and he obſerved, that ſhe frequently looked at a portrait of his mother that hung over the chimney."</p>
               <p>"I diſturb you, I fear, Miſs Littleton."</p>
               <p>"By no means, Sir," cried Rebecca, riſing, viſibly embarraſſed; "I was juſt going. Indeed, my being here is an intruſion, I muſt entreat you to pardon."</p>
               <p>"I ſhall be extremely ſorry if Miſs Littleton con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered herſelf as an intruder in any apartment in this houſe. You were drawing; will you permit me to ſee your performance?"</p>
               <p>"You will ſmile at my preſumption, Sir; but I have been endeavouring to catch ſome faint reſemblance of my regretted Lady, that ſhould any thing ſeparate me from her daughter's ſervice, I might have it in my power ſometimes to gaze on her beloved features and weep."</p>
               <p>"You have been happy in preſerving the likeneſs; but, I think, I have a miniature of my mother, the moſt ſtriking thing of the kind I ever ſaw."</p>
               <p>He then drew from his pocket a ſmall caſe, which contained Lady Mary's picture, elegantly ſet with brilliants, intermixed with pearls. It had been ſet as a preſent for Lady Oſſiter; but as that Lady knew not of her brother's deſign, he thought he might now diſpoſe of it more to his own ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Will Miſs Littleton honour me ſo far," ſaid he, taking it from the caſe, "as to wear this picture for the ſake of her whoſe reſemblance it bears?"</p>
               <p>"The picture of itſelf, Sir George, would be to me an invaluable treaſure; but its ornaments are ſo ſuperb and coſtly, you will pardon me if I decline the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it."</p>
               <p>"Why will you mortify me by this refuſal? You treat me very unkindly, Miſs Littleton, ſince even my mother's picture is not acceptable from my hands!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:027651_0059_0FD56475CDFAFEA8"/>"Indeed, Sir, you are miſtaken, and, to convince you I am not ungrateful, was that picture diveſted of its rich ornaments, I would accept it cheerfully, and wear it, not only for her ſake, but your own."</p>
               <p>"Charming, engaging woman! exclaimed he, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hand, "why are you thus irreſiſtibly lovely, and yet refuſe me the ſatisfaction of placing you above the malice of fortune?"</p>
               <p>She bluſhed carnation deep, as ſhe attempted to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw her hand; but a ſmile dimpled on her cheek, and her heart peeped forth from her tell-tale eyes.</p>
               <p>"You make me ſmile," ſaid ſhe, "to hear you talk of the malice of fortune. We, who are born in an humble ſtation, cannot feel the want of luxuries which we never enjoyed. Happineſs is not always annexed to wealth, or miſery to poverty. We are all poor or rich by compariſon, and my ſituation, which to you is an object of compaſſion, would be to thouſands the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of felicity; but your condeſcenſion makes me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get myſelf: I wiſh you a good night."</p>
               <p>"Stay one moment adorable Rebecca, cried Sir George, ſtopping her as ſhe was about to leave the room. "Hear me, I entreat you, with attention; by heavens, you ſhall never go into the ſervice of Lady Oſſiter, nor into any ſervice. I am your ſlave; my life, my forune, all are your's. I love you more than exiſtence itſelf. I mean not to offend your delicacy. My deſigns are of the moſt honourable nature. Name your own time, I will wait with patience. Only ſuffer me to tell my ſiſter, that the woman whom I aſpire to the honour of making my wife, muſt henceforth be treated with that reſpect her worth and virtue demands."</p>
               <p>"Hold, hold, dear Sir George," cried Rebecca, pale and trembling, "I muſt hear no more. You ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me, highly honour me by theſe profeſſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; but you talk of impoſſibilities.

               <p>"If your boſom, lovely Rebecca, glows with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, every obſtacle is eaſily removed."</p>

                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:027651_0060_0FD56476968F3908"/>"Do not interrupt me," ſaid ſhe. "The obſtacles I ſpeak of can never be removed; my vows are already pledged; they are regiſtered in heaven; 'tis ſacrilege to liſten to your declaration."</p>
               <p>Sir George dropped her hand, and, with a look of mingled horror and ſurpriſe, cried, "Are you already married?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied ſhe, faintly, "not married."</p>
               <p>"Then you ſport with my miſery, cruel, cruel girl!"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" ſaid Rebecca, with a look of tenderneſs, "heaven knows I do not. I would give worlds, did I poſſeſs them, to ſave you from one hour's anguiſh; but, ah! Sir George, mine is a wayward fate; my boſom is heavy laden with ſorrow. Ah! do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that ſorrow by letting me ſee you partake it."</p>
               <p>"Then," cried he, ſtarting from his ſeat, "then you do not hate me?"</p>
               <p>"Hate you, oh! no, that were impoſſible."</p>
               <p>"Then we may yet be happy," ſaid he, catching her in his arms.</p>
               <p>Rebecca's heart had almoſt betrayed her; but ſhe was ſenſible this muſt be the moment of victory. She puſhed him from her, and aſſuming an air of reſerve, "Sir George," ſaid ſhe, "if you wiſh my happineſs, there is but one way by which you can promote it, that is, by never more ſpeaking to me on this ſubject; my fate is irrevocably fixed; ceaſe then to diſturb my feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city by endeavouring to awaken my ſenſibility.

               <p>"Ah!" cried Rebecca, forcing a ſmile, "you talk wildly; we ſhall hear you tell a different tale ſhortly."</p>
               <p>"But will you not accept the picture as a token of my eſteem?"</p>
               <p>He held it towards her. She put his hand back, and ſaid, in a tone of diſpleaſure, "I can accept no diamonds, Sir George, and, for heaven's ſake, detain me no longer here. I have acted very improperly in talking with you ſo long; but I will take care this ſhall be our laſt interview."</p>
               <p>She then courtſeyed ſlightly, and retired to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, where conſcious rectitude alone alleviated the pangs of diſappointed love.</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſaid ſhe, "I have done right; an union with Sir George would by no means ſecure me perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent felicity; he is young, volatile, and poſſeſſed of violent paſſions. Alas! when the novelty of my perſon was worn off, I might ceaſe to charm, and how could I endure his neglect? beſides, how ill could my heart bear that he ſhould be ſubject to the ſneers of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance on my account.

               <p>Lappett was an experienced Abigail. She had lived with Lady Oſſiter from the time of her marriage, and could not, without envy, behold Rebecca introduced into the family, as ſhe feared ſhe might have a gown or two the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſupplant her intirely. This jealouſy made her reſolve to cultivate an intimacy with the unſuſpecting girl, and be the moſt forward in ſhowing her civilities, that ſhe might win her confidence, draw from her her real opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion concerning her Lady, and then betray her. Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pett, when ſhe had any favourite point to gain, could aſſume a moſt inſinuating manner. The words that fell from her tongue were ſmooth, and pleaſant as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's ſurface unruffled by a breeze: but like that, when the whirlwind of paſſion aroſe, diſplayed the moſt frightful contraſt.</p>
               <p>"And what do you think of my Lady?" ſaid ſhe, as ſhe was taking her tea in Rebecca's apartment.</p>
               <p>"I hardly know what to think yet," replied Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca. "I never judge very haſtily. She appears ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely good natured."</p>

               <p>"It ſhows the goodneſs of your heart, my dear ma'am," ſaid Lappett, beginning to ſee a little into the diſpoſition of our heroine. "But, pray, have you ſeen my Lord yet?"</p>

               <p>"Lord Oſſiter is a man of gallantry, though, I aſſure you, I muſt tell you, but it is between ourſelves, he once made propoſals to me."</p>

               <p>"Why, I thought it was a pity to loſe my place, ſo I kept my gentleman at a proper diſtance, and he dropped the purſuit: but come, ma'am, let us hurry the nurſery maid to put Miſs Oſſiter and the young gentlemen to bed, and then we will go down and take a game at cards in the houſekeeper's room."</p>

               <p>"Oh! dear, no, I ſhall not: I am never lonely. I work very faſt, and when I have done a good bit I can take up a book and read. I would rather not go down, if you will excuſe me."</p>
               <p>"Juſt as you pleaſe, ma'am," ſaid Lappett; "we ſhall be glad of your company, but if you prefer being alone—."</p>

Rebecca to the enjoyment of her own reflexions, while ſhe entertained her fellow ſervants with the pride, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and ignorance of the new comer. "I tried to get her down amongſt us, that we might have a little fun with her," ſaid ſhe, "for you would laugh to hear how fooliſhly ſhe talks. She will not ſtay here long, take my word for it."</p>
               <p>At leaſt Mrs. Lappett had reſolved, in her own mind, to uſe every exertion to diſplace Rebecca from a family where, ſhe was fearful, her beauty, innocence and worth, would attract the notice of one, whoſe devoirs ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as entirely due to herſelf.</p>
               <p>For, to own the truth, Mrs. Lappett had not been quite ſo deaf to the propoſals of her Lord as ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to Rebecca, though ſhe rather made a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in ſaying his Lordſhip had offered a ſettlement, that being a meaſure earneſtly deſired by herſelf, but which ſhe could find no means to bring Lord Oſſiter into: indeed, he had found her too eaſy a conqueſt to indulge a thought of putting himſelf to much expence or trouble on her account.</p>
               <p>The next morning, when Lady Oſſiter had break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſted, ſhe went immediately to the nurſery, a thing ſhe had not been known to do for many months before; but Rebecca was a novelty, and therefore demanded from her Lady ſome little attention; as Rebecca had been told that her Lady ſeldom, if ever, came into the children's apartment, the viſit was intirely unexpected, and Lady Oſſiter, found her buſily employed in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging ſome pencils and crayons in a ſmall, but elegant, drawing box, which had been given her by her late benefactreſs.</p>
               <p>She aroſe, and apologized for the confuſion her drawings, &amp;c. which had fallen on the floor, had made in the apartment; "had I known your Ladyſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this honour,"—</p>
               <p>"Oh! never mind, child," cried the Lady, with a look of infinite good humour, which no woman knew better how to aſſume than Lady Oſſiter: "I did not come to diſturb you, but I thought I ſhould like you to hear the children read."</p>

               <p>Rebecca, who had about two hours before ſeen them all neatly dreſſed, and given them their breakfaſt, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the adjoining room to call them, when how great was her ſurpriſe when ſhe ſaw the eldeſt boy, who was eight years old, with two or three colour-ſhells before him, ſeveral bruſhes, and a baſon of water, with which he had not been ſatisfied to daub ſeveral ſheets of paper, and his own clothes, but alſo his brother and ſiſter's hands, faces, and frocks! Infinitely chagrined that they ſhould be ſeen by their mother in ſuch a condition, ſhe turned mildly towards the nurſery maid, and aſked "how ſhe could be ſo neglectful as not to mind what the children were doing?"</p>
               <p>"Mind them yourſelf, ma'am," was the anſwer: "I thought you came here to help me, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me."</p>
               <p>"I ſhall for the future mind them," ſaid Rebecca, attempting to take the bruſhes from Maſter Oſſiter.</p>
               <p>"You ſhall not have them," ſcreamed he: "I will paint when I pleaſe; mamma ſays I ſhall."</p>
               <p>Rebecca perſiſted in removing from his reach the ſhells and water, when ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing up a ſcream like a bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamite, he threw one, which he had retained in his hand, full in her face!</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" cried Lady Oſſiter, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door. "Come hither, Charles; what do they do to you, my love?"</p>
               <p>"She will not let me play. She has taken away my paints, and will not let me do any thing."</p>
               <p>"But ſhe ſhall let you do as you pleaſe," ſaid the mother, kiſſing him, "ſo do not cry."</p>
               <p>At that moment another ſcream, from the inner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, vibrated in her Ladyſhip's ears, and Maſter James and Miſs Oſſiter came bellowing into the room, that "the new maid would waſh their faces."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:027651_0066_0FD56483A377C9C8"/>"Heaven ſave me," ſaid the Lady, "from often viſiting the nurſery! You are enough to drive one mad. I had hoped, indeed, that you, Rebecca, would have managed them better than to have had all this uproar; but I ſee ſervants are all alike; they have no more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the management of children than natural fools: why, I will anſwer for it, if I had time, I could make theſe children do juſt as I pleaſe, without any of this roaring. Do not you think, Charles, you would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mind me?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes, mamma; you never contradict me, but give me every thing I want."</p>
               <p>"Well, go, my dear, go to Rebecca and have your face waſhed, and you ſhall go out in the coach, and buy ſome more paints. Do, child, put James and Miſs Oſſiter on clean frocks, and get yourſelf ready to go out with them. I will hear them read another time; poor dears, they have been vexed enough this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:" then taking her favourite's hand, to lead him out of the room, ſhe ſtopped, and picked up two or three of Rebecca's drawings.—"Here, my love," ſaid ſhe, "aſk your maid to give you theſe pretty pictures."</p>
               <p>Rebecca was too meek to contradict, and he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off with her two beſt performances in his hand.</p>
               <p>In about ten minutes a footman tapped at the door, to inform Rebecca that the chariot waited, and that ſhe muſt go to her Lady's dreſſing-room for Maſter Oſſiter.</p>

               <p>"See, Rebecca," cried ſhe, we have diſpatched theſe pretty pictures, I dare ſay, a deal quicker than you made them."</p>
               <p>Rebecca ſmiled faintly; but ſhe felt a cold chill ſtrike

               <p>"Drive to the toy-ſhop," ſaid Maſter Oſſiter, as the man ſhut the chariot-door, "and ſee what mamma has given me," continued he, pulling half a guine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As the chariot ſtopped at the ſhop door, a poor man, pale and emaciated, with but one leg, took off his hat, bowed, but did not ſpeak.</p>
               <p>"Look at that poor man, my dear," ſaid Rebecca; "he would be very thankful for a ſmall part of your money; ſuppoſe you was to give him a ſhilling?"</p>
               <p>"What ſhould I give him a ſhilling for?" ſaid the child.</p>
               <p>"Becauſe he is in great diſtreſs; ſee how pale he looks, and what a thin ragged coat he has on this cold day!"</p>
               <p>"Well, what is that to me?"</p>
               <p>"Suppoſe, Maſter Oſſiter, you were cold and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry?"</p>
               <p>"That you know is impoſſible."</p>

               <p>"Yes, to be ſure; a'nt I a Lord's ſon, and ſhall not I be a Lord myſelf, if I live long enough? and, you know, Lords are never poor."</p>
               <p>"Then is it the more their duty to relieve thoſe that are."</p>
               <p>"Duty!" ſaid he, ſtaring in her face; "mamma never gives any thing to poor folks; ſhe ſays they ſhould be all ſent to priſon, and made work."</p>
               <p>This dialogue had paſſed in the ſhop, and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſubject of it ſtill was at the door. Miſs Oſſiter put her little hand inſtinctively into her pocket.</p>

               <p>A Few days after this Lady Oſſiter ſent for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, in haſte, to her dreſſing-room. "You ſeem to have ſome taſte for drawing child," ſaid ſhe, "pray can you paint flowers."</p>
               <p>"A little, madam."</p>
               <p>"Well, now I want you to do ſomething for me; I laſt night ſaw the moſt beautiful painted trimming, and I'll take you to a ſhop this morning where you ſhall ſee ſome like it; if you think you can do it, I ſhall be vaſtly pleaſed, for there is a ball next week."</p>
               <p>"But your ladyſhip is in mourning," ſaid Rebecca, bluſhing for her lady's folly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, la! well, I proteſt I forgot that, but now, I dare ſay you could fancy me ſomething pretty in black and white; do try child: I ſhall change my mourning in about a month, and I think you can do it in that time."</p>
               <p>"If I knew what would pleaſe your Ladyſhip."</p>
               <p>"Do it according to your own taſte, Rebecca, and I am ſure it will be pretty."</p>
               <p>The good natured Rebecca was willing to pleaſe to the utmoſt of her power, but, alas, that power was far from adequate to the many taſks impoſed upon her. Mrs. Lappett was a great favourite, therefore often aſked leave to go out, and then Rebecca was ſummoned to attend the toilette of her lady, and indeed her taſte and judgment in the arrangment of female ornaments
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:027651_0069_0FD56489506C1230"/>
was ſo elegant, that Lady Oſſiter never appeared to greater advantage than when dreſſed by her hands.</p>
               <p>Then was a morning cap to be made, or a dreſs freſh trimmed, they were all brought to Rebecca; and did her Ladyſhip ever aſk for any thing that was not ready, the anſwer was, indeed, my Lady, I gave it to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, two or three days ago, but ſhe is ſuch a fine lady, and ſpends ſo much time at her book and her mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic.</p>
               <p>In the mean time our fair heroine was ſacrificing her health to the vain hope of obtaining the approbation of her lady, ſhe had not a moment for the moſt trifling relaxation; obliged to riſe early, on account of the children, for the very nurſery maid impoſed upon her good nature, and left her entirely to dreſs and undreſs them. Mrs. Lappett would, if in the leaſt indiſpoſed, retire to reſt, and leave Rebecca to ſit up for her lady, who was addicted to the faſhionable vice of gaming, and often was from home till four, five, nay ſometimes ſix o'clock in the morning; and when ſhe had ill luck, would return in the moſt diabolical humour, and vent that ſpleen which politeneſs obliged her to conceal in company, on her meek unoffending attendant; indeed to ſuch height did ſhe often ſuffer her paſſion to riſe, that Rebecca, on hearing the knocker announce her arrival, would fall into ſuch a fit of trembling, that ſhe was ſcarcely able to ſtand, while ſhe undreſſed her.</p>
               <p>But the reader muſt not ſuppoſe that, during this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, either Sir George or Lord Oſſiter had forgot her; the former had written her ſeveral letters, which ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unopened: for, ſaid ſhe, conſcious as I am of my own weakneſs, why ſhould I wilfully expoſe it to trials it may not be able to withſtand. At length, wearied out with her inflexible reſolution, he determined to take a trip to the continent, and endeavour to baniſh her from his thoughts; but before he went, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at leaſt to put it in her power to leave his ſiſter whenever her ſituation became painful, without being obliged to have recourſe to ſervitude again. And Mrs. Harley was the perſon he determined to employ on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:027651_0070_0FD5648B1383D598"/>Lord Oſſiter had made frequent attempts to ſee and converſe with Rebecca, but ſhe was ſo much in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment with the children, or in her lady's dreſſing room, with Lappett, that he found it more difficult than he at firſt imagined, and he was too cautious in his affairs of gallantry to uſe pen and paper.</p>
               <p>Lord and Lady Oſſiter were a very faſhionable couple; they had married without affection, becauſe their friends thought they were exactly ſuitable for each other in birth and fortune; his Lordſhip had always kept up a ſhow of politeneſs towards his wife, ſeldom contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her or complained of her expences, though in his heart he deſpiſed her pride and affectation, and laughed at her abſurdity. He knew her well enough, to be certain his honour was perfectly ſafe in her keeping, not from a conviction of her principles being juſt or her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue impregnable, but he was fully ſenſible that ſelf-love was her prevalent paſſion, and though ſhe was diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly fond of admiration, her heart was animated by none of thoſe ſenſibilities which, though they in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral elevate the female mind, not unfrequently lay it open to the greateſt errors.</p>
               <p>One morning, as Rebecca was intently engaged in completing the trimming we have mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mrs. Harley unexpectedly entered the room.</p>
               <p>A faint gleam of pleaſure animated the countenance, and beamed from the eyes of Rebecca, as ſhe aroſe to receive this faithful ſervant of Lady Mary's.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Harley," ſaid ſhe, taking her cordially by the hand, "to what am I to attribute this unexpected pleaſure."</p>
               <p>Struck with her palid cheeks and altered air, Harley firſt bruſhed off a ſtarting tear and then diſcloſed her errand—</p>
               <p>"I come, my dear Miſs, from my good young maſter—"</p>
               <p>"If to bring me a letter," ſaid Rebecca, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, "I muſt beg you to excuſe me—"</p>
               <p>"My dear child," ſaid Harley, "don't fly out in this manner, but liſten to me attentively; I have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of my own, Miſs Littleton, and heaven forbid I

ſhould ever adviſe a young innocent creature to a wrong ſtep; truſt me, I am actuated only by friendſhip, when I entreat you to inform me what motives you have for thus obſtinately refuſing the offers of a man of rank and fortune, who loves you honourably and ſincerely."</p>
               <p>"Do not aſk me, dear Harley; do not let us talk on this ſubject."</p>
               <p>"We will talk on no other then, for ſure I am there muſt be ſome powerful reaſon for your conduct. Is your heart otherways engaged? Does want of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune prevent your happineſs?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, no! no! my friend," cried Rebecca, her head falling on Harley's ſhoulder, and her eyes filling with tears; I am unhappy becauſe I am not inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble."</p>
               <p>"You talk in riddles, my dear; if you are not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, ſtop! ſtop! you muſt ſay no more, unleſs you mean to break my heart; for, alas, Harley, the laſt time I ſaw my dear departed Lady Mary, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her, ſolemnly promiſed her, by every hope of felicity, never to liſten to an overture of love from Sir George; and never, no never, while I retain the leaſt remembrance of what is paſt, will I break a vow ſo ſolemnly given."</p>
               <p>"This family pride," ſaid Harley, "was the only foible my lady had."</p>
               <p>"She had no foible," ſaid Rebecca; "it was a wiſh to inſure my felicity alone, prompted the requeſt."</p>
               <p>"Whatever was her motive, my dear Miſs, promiſes when once made ſhould be ſacredly obſerved; I will therefore ſay no more to you on the ſubject: Sir George, ſince ſatisfied you will not accept his offers, is reſolved next Monday to leave England."</p>
               <p>Rebecca turned pale, and Harley continued.</p>

to have provided for you—more ſhame for ſome folks that they forget her laſt commands; but we cannot always make people do as they ought. Now, you muſt take this money, and conſider it as her bequeſt. I am ſure you will find it neceſſary very ſoon to quit this family; your dear pale cheeks and heavy eyes tell me you ſhould at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be in your bed, rather than at work." She then drew out the picture, which was only ſet in plain gold.</p>
               <p>Rebecca took it, preſſed it to her lips, and, tying the ribbon that was fixed to it round her neck, placed it as a ſacred depoſit in her boſom. She alſo took the bank note and put it in her pocket book, but ſecretly reſolved that nothing but the ſevereſt neceſſity ſhould tempt her to break into it.</p>
               <p>When Monday arrived, Rebecca could not avoid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the window at the ſound of every carriage that drew up to the door.</p>
               <p>"He will not ſurely leave England," ſaid ſhe, "with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking leave of his ſiſter."</p>
               <p>About two o'clock ſhe ſaw his chariot draw up to the door, and, half concealing herſelf behind the window ſhutter, gazed on him, and breathed a prayer for his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, as ſhe ſaw him alight. In about half an hour ſhe was deſired to bring Miſs Oſſiter and Maſter James into the drawing-room. She took them to the door, opened it and put them in, but her feelings were too powerful to permit her to enter.</p>
               <p>"Ah, uncle," ſaid Miſs Oſſiter, running eagerly to Sir George, "I am glad you are come, I have been waiting for you this long, long time."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear Lucy," ſaid he, fondly taking her on his knee, "and what might make you wiſh to ſee me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Becauſe I love you dearly," ſaid ſhe, throwing her little arms round his neck, "but that a'nt all."</p>
               <p>"No! what elſe was it then?"</p>
               <p>She lowered her voice, and, clapping her mouth cloſe to his ear, ſaid, "I owe my maid half-a-crown, and I told her you would pay her."</p>
               <p>"Sir George was ſurpriſed. "And pray how does that happen?" ſaid he.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:027651_0073_0FD564930F026458"/>"Rebecca lent it me," ſaid ſhe, ſtill lowering her voice, "to give a poor man."</p>
               <p>"Rebecca, what Rebecca?" ſaid Sir George, aſtoniſhed.</p>
               <p>"Why, Rebecca," replied the child; "my own maid Rebecca, that teaches me to read and ſay my prayers, and tells me if I am good I ſhall go to heaven."</p>
               <p>"What ſtuff is the child talking?" ſaid Lady Oſſiter, catching the laſt word.</p>
               <p>Sir George was too much affected to ſpeak; he put a couple of guineas into Lucy's hand, and haſtily kiſſing them all, hurried out of the houſe; as he ſeated himſelf in the chaiſe, he caſt his eyes towards the upper windows.

               <p>Though Lady Oſſiter pretended to deſire her Lord's company, it was, in fact, the fartheſt thing from her wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. She had for ſome time paſt been admired and followed by the Duke of—; a conqueſt ſo brilliant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, was the higheſt gratification to this vain woman, and ſhe had heard with pleaſure her huſband's intended ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in the city, as ſhe was reſolved to ſee his Grace for half an hour at home, previous to their meeting at Lady Rackett's ball, where ſhe was engaged to dance with him.</p>
               <p>But Lord Oſſiter had frequently given her a few pretty plain hints in regard to her conduct with her noble admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and therefore, though ſhe had reſolved to ſee him, ſhe thought it would be beſt to do it privately, and Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pett being unfortunately gone to viſit a ſick brother in the country, ſhe was obliged to make Rebecca her confidante on the occaſion, and immediately, on retiring from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, ſhe ſummoned her to her dreſſing-room.</p>
               <p>"Rebecca, child," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe entered, "I think I have not given you any thing ſince you have been with me, and you have done more than half of Lappett's buſineſs for her; there is that blue ſatin gown and coat, you may take it, and as it is rather ſoiled, here is ſomething to pay for the dying and making up, preſenting her with a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of guineas.

               <p>"Oh, no, that will not do half ſo well, for then, I ſhould not have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing his chagrin, ſo, Rebecca, you ſhall take a note, which I will write; and ſend it, unknown to any of the other ſervants, and when his grace comes he ſhall come diſguiſed, and paſs for your brother, and you can bring him to my dreſſing-room."</p>

that ſhe had acted right in rejecting the infamous ſervice ſhe would have employed her in.</p>
               <p>Contrary to her Lady's expectation, Rebecca had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reached her own apartment when Lappett returned, and entered the dreſſing-room, to receive Lady Oſſiter's command.</p>
               <p>"Well, Lappett," ſaid ſhe, "you are returned in very good time, for I have been ſo groſsly affronted by that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle prude, Rebecca, that I can hardly contain my anger; do you know the impertinent creature had the audacity to refuſe getting me a note conveyed to the Duke of—; though I had condeſcended to inform her that my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were only to laugh at him.

               <p>The obſequious abigail took the note, conveyed it her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and at eight o'clock in the evening his Grace was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her Lady's dreſſing-room.</p>

               <p>But it was the opinion of Rebecca, that every truly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman ſhould carefully avoid even the appearance of indiſcretion, eſpecially thoſe whoſe elevated ſtations might render their examples infinitely pernicious to their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors: ſhe therefore felt herſelf greatly hurt by Lady Oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's want of prudence, and flattered herſelf the repulſe ſhe had met from her would prevent her making her deſigns known to any other ſervant, and ſhe readily imagined Mrs. Lappett would be as unwilling as herſelf to engage in the buſineſs; ſo when informed ſhe was ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>While the Duke and her Ladyſhip were together, the artful Lappett thought ſhe would juſt ſtep in and hear what Rebecca had to ſay on the ſubject, for, by her ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious appearance of friendſhip, ſhe had ſo won on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpicious heart of our heroine, that ſhe never ſcrupled to communicate to her every thought as it aroſe, except thoſe which concerned Sir George, (and thoſe ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conceal, if poſſible, even from herſelf.)</p>
               <p>"So," cried Lappett, ſitting down, "my Lady and you had a tiff to day, I find."</p>
               <p>"We did not quite agree," ſaid Rebecca, ſlightly, "but I dare ſay ſhe has forgot it by this time; I am ſure I do not wiſh to remember it."</p>

               <p>"Oh, Yes, the moment I came in. I declare it is a pity my Lord is not acquainted with her conduct."</p>
               <p>"It would be a cruel thing, Mrs. Lappett, to plant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion between man and wife: beſides, I dare ſay, my Lady, though imprudent, is not crimi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"To be ſure my Lady has ſome excuſe; my Lord is always after other women: he is ſeldom at home, and I am certain don't care a pin about his wife."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps if her Ladyſhip was more attentive to increaſe his domeſtic comforts, he would neceſſarily grow more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to home, but while ſhe is ſo extravagantly fond of diſſipation, and while the four honours have the power to keep her from home, night after night, can we be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed if her huſband ſeeks abroad for that felicity he is ſure of not meeting in his own houſe."</p>

She took her muſic books and a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and went to a ſmall parlour, in a retired part of the houſe, where ſtood a fine toned inſtrument, and where ſhe ſat down and amuſed herſelf, unthinking how time paſt, and entirely inattentive to the footſteps that paſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the door of the apartment. The muſic ſoothed and compoſed the perturbation of her ſpirits. She played ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral little plaintive airs, and accompanied them with her voice; and among the reſt, the ſong ſhe was ſinging when Sir George firſt ſaw her. When ſhe had got nearly through it, the remembrance of that ſcene—the ſtriking contraſt of her ſituation then and now, ſtruck ſo forcibly on her imagination that ſhe was unable to proceed. She pauſed, and tears involuntarily ſtole down her cheeks; her amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ended; ſhe roſe from her ſeat, and was ſhutting the book, when ſomebody laid hold of her, and repeating, <q>

               <p>But Lappett was not to be deceived: ſhe had heard him utter words of tenderneſs, and was ſufficiently convinced Rebecca was her rival.</p>
               <p>"The creature is ſo affected," ſaid ſhe, "I declare there

               <p>Rebecca was now recovering, and, raiſing her head, ſhe caught hold of Lappett's gown, as ſhe turned to leave the room, and exclaimed, "Do not leave me, ſtay, ſave me, take me from this place."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Madam, I am in a hurry," cried Lappett, twitching her gown from the feeble graſp of Rebecca, and flung out of the room, audibly ſaying, "Her Lady ſhould be informed what ſort of a perſon ſhe had in her family."</p>
               <p>Rebecca aroſe, diſengaged herſelf from his Lordſhip's arms, who no longer attempted to detain her, and with trembling ſteps returned to her apartment.</p>

               <p>"SO, Madam, cried Lappett, as ſhe was aſſiſting her Lady to riſe the next morning; "ſo, Madam, though Mrs. Rebecca was ſo delicate as to refuſe convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a letter to his Grace, ſhe has no objection to private interviews with my Lord.

I diſcovered, I thought I ſhould have ſwooned away, for there ſat Rebecca, faſt locked in my Lord's arms, and her head leaned on his ſhoulders."</p>
               <p>"Very well," cried Lady Oſſiter, peeviſhly, the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of reſentment ruſhing over her face and neck, "why am I plagued with this long ſtory: one would think you were jealous of the creature, by the paſſion you are in."</p>
               <p>"I jealous, my Lady, does your Ladyſhip think?"—</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! I don't think about it; I ſuppoſe my Lord is not worſe than other men of his rank, and while he is not wanting in reſpect to me, I ſhall not trouble myſelf about his amuſements; to be ſure, it is rather mortifying to have a little inſignificant huſſy preferred in one's own houſe."</p>
               <p>"That is what I ſay, Madam."</p>
               <p>"You have no right to ſay or think about it; if I am ſatisfied with my Lord's conduct, I deſire I may hear none of your flippant impertinence upon a ſubject that don't concern you."</p>
               <p>"I have done, Ma'am, but I hope you'll diſcharge—"</p>
               <p>"I certainly ſhall diſcharge every ſervant of mine, whoſe conduct diſpleaſes me, therefore, Lappett, read that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent ſcrawl, and then let me know what wages are due to you."</p>
               <p>Lappett took the letter, and trembled as ſhe took it, for ſhe knew it to be one which ſhe had written to her ſiſter, and having intruſted it to the houſe-maid to put it in the poſt, the girl's curioſity led her to open it, but, being ſurpriſed by the entrance of her lady whilſt in the act of reading it, ſhe had, in her hurry to put it in her pocket, dropped it, and while the officious Lappett was contriving to introduce the Duke unperceived to her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this unfortunate letter diſcovered her criminal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with her Lord. But though Lady Oſſiter had thus bridled her paſſion while talking to her infamous confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dante, ſhe no ſooner ſaw the innocent Rebecca, than ſhe vented on her that torrent of abuſe fear had prevented her from pouring on the other.</p>
               <p>Artful infamous ſtrumpet, were her elegant expreſſions, to pretend to ſuch refinement of ſentiment, and yet be guilty of ſuch glaring faults.</p>
               <p>In vain Rebecca wept, and called on heaven to witneſs her innocence; even when kneeling, ſhe requeſted not to
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:027651_0083_0FD564A69FF64BF8"/>
be bereaved of her only refuge, an unblemiſhed character. The haughty Lady Oſſiter ſpurned her from her, and bid her inſtantly leave her houſe, and get her bread without, for ſhe was well convinced ſhe did not deſerve one.</p>
               <p>Lord Oſſiter, prepared as he was to meet her anger, was unable to bear the illiberal abuſe with which ſhe loaded him; he therefore ſatisfied himſelf with telling her, when ſhe practiſed the duties of a wife, he would begin to ſtudy thoſe of a huſband; till then, ſhe had no right to complain, and left her to compoſe her ſpirits, as ſhe could, while he inquired of his valet what he knew concerning Rebecca.</p>
               <p>He ſoon learnt, by inquiries being made among the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that Rebecca was diſmiſſed, and that ſhe had taken a place in the Lincolnſhire ſtage, in order to return to her mother. This was ſufficient intelligence for his Lordſhip, and he began to plan ſchemes for getting her in his power.</p>
               <p>When Rebecca came to take leave of the children, her feelings were undeſcribable. Miſs Oſſiter hung about her neck; even Charles and James begged her not to go, and they would be good boys and never vex her by behaving ill again. She embraced them all tenderly, and with a heart almoſt broken, got into a hackney-coach, which took her to the inn from whence the ſtage ſet out. She aſked to be ſhown to an apartment, and ordered ſome trifle for her ſupper, then ſitting down by a little ſolitary ſire, began to reflect on her vexations, nor did ſhe conſider it as the leaſt, that ſhe was obliged to return to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who had written to her but twice during her reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in London, and even thoſe letters were ſhort and cold.</p>
               <p>The five hundred pounds Mrs. Harley had given her, ſhe did not conſider as her own property, and beſides that, ſhe was poſſeſſed of but ten guineas in the world; to be ſure ſhe had a few valuable trinkets, preſents from Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a good ſtock of clothes; but what was that, when ſhe wanted ſupport it would ſoon be gone. In the midſt of theſe painful reflexions ſhe drew the picture of her benefactreſs from her boſom, and contemplated it as her chief, her almoſt only comfort. But, examining it mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

diſcovered to her the portrait of Sir George, fixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind that of his mother.</p>
               <p>Spite of herſelf ſhe could not help gazing on it with pleaſure, and when ſhe conſidered the delicacy with which he had managed to preſent it to her, he roſe higher than ever in her eſteem.</p>
               <p>"Ah," ſaid ſhe, "he certainly loves me, and is worthy my eſteem. Why are we not born for each other, for ſure I am, I' could be content with Sir George, though in the humbleſt ſtation: more—far more happy than in an elevated ſphere; for in the humbler walks of life the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity we experience muſt proceed from a mutual deſire to pleaſe, but in an exalted ſtation we live not for ourſelves but others, at leaſt if we have not fortitude to ſcorn and deſpiſe the ſneers of the faſhionable world."</p>
               <p>Rebecca could not help conſidering the poſſeſſion of this portrait, at this period, as an invaluable treaſure, and in her own breaſt ſolemnly vowed never to part from it. She indulged herſelf in gazing on it while ſhe ſat up, and when ſhe retired to bed, laid it on her pillow, and fell, into a compoſed ſlumber, which laſted till called at four o'clock to join the paſſengers in the coach. Refreſhed and comforted by the reſt ſhe had taken, Rebecca aroſe with alacrity to purſue her journey, and nothing material occurred till they had proceeded upwards of fifty miles from town, when the coach was overtaken by a peſt-chaiſe and four, in which was a man, who ſtopped the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and aſked if there was not a young perſon within ſide of the name of Littleton. "Yes," cried Rebecca, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently looking out of the window, "my name is Littleton."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Ma'am," cried the man, "I am commanded to entreat you to return.

haſtily from the coach, and only taking with her a ſmall portmanteau, containing a neceſſary change of linen, got into the chaiſe, and though drawn as quick as four horſes could carry her, ſhe thought every moment an hour, ſo anxious was ſhe to arrive in Bedford-Square.</p>

               <p>IT was very late when Rebecca entered London, and ſhe was not enough acquainted with the ſtreets to know whether ſhe was going right or wrong; therefore, when the chaiſe ſtopped in a large ſquare, ſhe jumped eagerly out and ran into the houſe, without once conſidering whether ſhe knew the place; but when ſhe had got in the hall and the door was ſhut, juſt as ſhe was going to run up ſtairs, the ſtaircaſe, which was different to the one ſhe had been uſed to, ſtruck her, and turning haſtily round to demand why ſhe was brought to a ſtrange place, ſhe ſaw the parlour door open, and in an inſtant Lord Oſſiter was at her feet.</p>
               <p>"Good God!" ſaid ſhe, "where am I? why am I thus betrayed?"</p>

               <p>"If that is all," cried Rebecca, ſcarcely able to reſpire, through terror, aſſure yourſelf I have forgiven you, my Lord, and will pardon the deceit you have been guilty of, if you will ſuffer me inſtantly to quit this houſe, where every moment I remain fill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he began to hint that he had made ſeveral lucky hits in the lottery, and ſhould leave-off buſineſs, or at leaſt throw it into ſuch a line, that a few hours attendance every day would be ſufficient, and the reſt might be performed by perſons whom he would employ for that purpoſe. Things were in this ſtate when we were wrote to, and the match, as repreſented by her aunt, being every way beyond our expectations, we freely gave our conſent; nay, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted were we with the hope of her being ſo well ſettled, that we made our neighbours partakers of our joys, and our daughter's good fortune was univerſally talked of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One evening, as we were ſitting in our little parlour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Two days after her marriage, her huſband ſaid he ſhould be obliged to leave her for the night, having a little buſineſs to tranſact a few miles out of town, but he would be with her again by dinner the next day. After he was gone, feeling herſelf rather ſolitary, ſhe put on her hat and cloak and went to her miſtreſs's, where ſhe found ſeveral of her old companions preparing to go to the play. This being a diverſion ſhe was fond of, but little perſuaſion was neceſſary to get her to join the party; accordingly, attended by a genteel young man, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Covent-Garden, and got a very excellent ſeat in the two ſhilling gallery. The firſt act of the play was nearly finiſhed, when a little buſtle in the ſtage-box occaſioning Jenny to look that way, ſhe ſaw her huſband enter, leading a very plain woman, ſuperbly dreſſed, and take his ſeat beſide her on the front row.</p>

Jenny's heart was ſtill too full of the idea of Ponſonville to ſuffer any other attachment to grow on it; but poverty began to ſtare us in the face: ſhe ſaw on one ſide, a mother, a child pining with want, no protector, no friend to comfort and relieve them; on the other, a home, a protector, and a place of refuge for thoſe objects ſo dear to her heart. She acceded to his propoſal and was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.

               <p>Rebecca's ſenſations, on the receipt of this letter, are better imagined than deſcribed. Scarcely ſix months had elapſed ſince the death of her father, and her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was married again—that mother, who, but a ſhort time ſince, had declared, that to be ſuſpected capable of admitting a ſecond partner, was an inſult that hurt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

to be ſure Mrs. Harris had been very kind to her, but could ſhe expect that kindneſs to laſt when ſhe had loſt the power of making her any recompenſe. However ſhe determined to make ſome inquiry concerning her trunk, and to that end requeſted Mrs. Harris to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her; but all the tidings ſhe could learn was, that the coachman had left it in the country, and that he had ſince heard it had been taken away by a perſon who ſaid he came from Miſs Littleton herſelf, with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to pay all neceſſary expences.</p>
               <p>"Was there any thing of much value in the trunk?" ſaid Mrs. Harris.</p>
               <p>"Alas!" cried Rebecca, "there was the greateſt part of my clothes, and a five hundred pound bank note, which I had to keep for a perſon who is gone abroad."</p>
               <p>"Pray, child, what kind of a man is this father-in-law of your's?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I can hardly tell you; he never viſited my father during his life, nor did I ever ſee him above twice, except at church; he has been a widower ſome years, and has one daughter; he is an attorney by profeſſion, but I believe he had never much practice."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps your mother's annuity was the object that invited this marriage."</p>
               <p>"It may be ſo, but I can hardly think it, for at the utmoſt it is not more than forty pounds a year. My mother has an agreeable perſon, and lively manner; I do not think it improbable but he may have married her for love."</p>
               <p>"I do not think it improbable but he has got your trunk."</p>
               <p>"Dear, Mrs. Harris, how can you ſuggeſt ſuch a thing; you quite ſhock me."</p>
               <p>"Shock you or not, I think that is really the caſe, and I would adviſe you to purſue legal methods to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it."</p>
               <p>"No," cried Rebecca, reſolutely, "never; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring myſelf to ſuſpect that my mother would unite herſelf to a man capable of ſuch an action, and if that
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:027651_0099_0FD5657693D7CDB0"/>
were really the caſe, I hope I have too high a ſenſe of filial reſpect to attempt expoſing her to the malicious cenſures of a world, who would not fail to involve her, however innocent, in her huſband's guilt. My own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſhall ever give way to her peace of mind, for ſhe was the choſen companion, the boſom friend of the beſt of fathers, and though ſhe ſeems to have forgot that I am her child, I can never forget ſhe is my mother."</p>
               <p>"All this may be very clever, for what I know," ſaid Mrs. Harris, "but I am ſure, in my opinion, it is very ridiculous. You will find, my poor ſimple child, your ſix guineas will go but a little way towards buying you clothes fit for a decent place; however, we muſt not meet troubles half way, it will be time enough when you have got a place, to think about preparing to go to it; but I have an acquaintance lives in this ſtreet, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may have it in her power to help you to ſomething."</p>
               <p>They called on the perſon mentioned, who was lady's woman in an opulent merchant's family. Mrs. Harris mentioned Rebecca's intentions, and learnt that there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

She was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to the Lady, who, ſtruck with her lovely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and modeſt demeanour, conceived an inſtant prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in her favour, and engaged her, upon liberal terms, to enter her ſervice on that day week.</p>
               <p>Rebecca felt extremely happy that ſhe ſhould no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be a burden upon the kind Mrs. Harris, and eagerly ſet about preparing as well as the narrow ſtate of her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances would allow, to take poſſeſſion of her new place.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barton the name of Rebecca's miſtreſs) was a pleaſing lively brunette, about twenty years old. She had married, when very young, contrary to the advice of her friends, a young man of ſmall fortune and rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Barton was really attached to her in the firſt years of their marriage, but his temper was too verſatile to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

conſtant to any thing, he in time grew cool, and often played her falſe, but ſhe was of ſuch an even, cheerful, unſuſpecting temper, ſo unaffectedly tender, ſo attentive to his intereſt, and ſtudious of his peace, that he found it impoſſible to treat her with unkindneſs, ſo that there was always an appearance of much cordiality between them, for though ſhe could not ſhut her eyes and ears upon his infidelities, ſhe wiſely concluded it was prudent ſometimes to be wilfully deaf and blind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that if good humour would not reclaim him, all humour would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make him worſe.</p>
               <p>With this couple Rebecca went into Shropſhire, a few weeks after ſhe entered Mrs. Barton's ſervice. Their houſe was a venerable gothic building, ſituated in the midſt of a beautiful park, and had fallen to Mrs. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton on the death of her godfather, from whom alſo ſhe inherited her independent fortune. Rebecca found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much at her eaſe, Mrs. Barton was very kind to her, and finding ſhe poſſeſſed an intelligent mind, often made her the companion of her rambles about the grounds and adjacent country. Mr. Barton troubled his lady but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with his company, except at meals, and ſometimes not then: nay, he even went ſo far as to ſleep from home ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral nights in the week; and this being a liberty he had never before taken, without his wife being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, though this old man was the owner of the mill and cottage, and ground many a buſhed of corn for his poor neighbours, of which he never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take his regular toll; yet it ſo happened that he was but poor himſelf.

Ah, bleſs the dear face of it, I ſhall live to ſee her a great lady I warrant, and then it will ſend ſome people to mend old grandad's cottage, and repair the crazy old mill." Theſe were the waking dreams of doating age, for alas Dolly had reached her ſeventeenth year and no ſquire had yet made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, to verify her grandmother's prophecy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever about this time one of Mr. Barton's footmen, a ſmart lad, about nineteen years old, ſaw this paragon of ruſtic beauty at a neighbouring fair, and, unfortunately for his maſter's horſes, from that day whenever he was diſpatched to the neighbouring town or villages, on meſſages, errands, or what not, he always found the old miller's cottage lay directly in the way between Belle Park and the place to which he was diſpatched.</p>
               <p>One evening Mr. Barton having mounted his horſe, and called Thomas to attend him in his intended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, being undetermined which way to go, aſked the lad if he had diſcovered lately any new ride, for, he ſaid, I have gone the old track ſo often I am weary of it.

               <p>She ſpoke loud, the evening was ſerene; her voice vibrated on the ear of Barton; he turned his head, the old mill, the trees, and rocks were no longer intereſting objects. "I will have a little chat with the old man," ſaid he, guiding his horſe that way, but his eyes were fixed on the lovely form of Dolly. He chatted with the old couple till it was nearly dark, and as he rode homeward could think only on the charms of their grand-daughter. The next evening he rode that way again, unattended, talked ſomething about repairing the mill, and kiſſed Dolly at parting. Another and another interview ſucceeded.

               <p>But Barton was by no means a liberal lover; he talked much but performed little, and though he ſlept ſeveral nights in a week at Gaffer Jobſon's, he was content to ſleep on their homely mattraſs, nor once thought of providing another.</p>
               <p>Poor Thomas, mortified to the ſoul, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his vexation, nor did he make a ſecret of the cauſe among his fellow ſervants.

               <p>"Do you know child," ſaid ſhe to Rebecca, one day as ſhe was aſſiſting her to dreſs; "do you know, child, that this truant huſband of mine is fallen in love with ſome chubby faced little chit in the neighbourhood, and prefers the company of her and her ignorant relations to my elegant ſociety, and their hard bed and coarſe ſheets to his own made of down and covered with the fineſt holland: do you not think the man is turned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="106" facs="unknown:027651_0105_0FD564CE53FE7438"/>Rebecca thought this an odd ſtep, but ſhe had a very high opinion of Mrs. Barton's ſenſe and prudence, and therefore prepared to attend her without intimating the leaſt diſapprobation of the ſcheme, which ſhe certainly would have ventured to do, had ſhe not been ſatisfied that her lady had ſome very good reaſons for her conduct.</p>
               <p>About four o'clock they ſtepped into the chariot, and proceeded to the mill without any attendant. They left the carriage within a quarter of a mile of the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and went thither on foot, pretended wearineſs, and aſked leave to reſt and have a draught of water. "Would you like a little wine in your water, my Lady," ſaid the old woman.</p>
               <p>"I ſhould have hardly ſuppoſed," replied Mrs. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, "that your cottage afforded ſuch a luxury."</p>

Prepared as Mrs. Barton was to ſee ſomething extremely lovely, the charms of this little ruſtic ſurpaſſed her imagination. "What a lovely creature," ſaid ſhe, ſoftly, to Rebecca; "how could Barton be ſo wantonly cruel as to contaminate the ſoul which animates this beauteous form." The tears ſtarted in her eyes as ſhe ſpoke, but bruſhed them away unperceived. "And ſo my dear you are going to be married, I underſtand, and to a ſquire. I have ſome idea he is a friend of mine. I believe he ſpends much of his time here, but I think your accommodations are not very brilliant. You muſt give me leave to ſend you ſome better furniture, and to give orders to have your houſe repaired; and ſhould your lover inquire who it was ordered theſe things, tell him it was a lady who has a great regard for him, and lives at the old faſhioned houſe in the park.</p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:027651_0106_0FD564D0958AE868"/>Manifold were the courteſys and awkward acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments poured forth by the grand-mother and Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but Mrs. Barton imagined ſhe ſaw in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the latter mingled ſhame and regret. "If we could ſave this poor girl," ſaid ſhe to Rebecca, when they were ſeated again in the carriage; "if we could ſave her and teach her the value of the gem ſhe has unconſciouſly thrown away, we might then lead her back to virtue, and, ſpite of her errors, ſhe may yet become a valuable member of ſociety."</p>
               <p>The carriage drove to the neareſt town, when Mrs. Barton went to an upholſterer's and ordered whatever ſhe thought neceſſary, to be taken immediately to the cottage; ſhe likewiſe engaged a carpenter to ſend peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the next day, to begin the repairs, and on returning home ſhe diſpatched a large bundle of ſheets, table li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, &amp;c. by a poor labourer who knew nothing of the reports current in the family.

               <p>Barton entered the room with the looks of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned criminal. "Betſey," ſaid he, "where were you the day before yeſterday, and how did you employ your time?"</p>
               <p>"Not in a manner diſagreeable to you, I hope," ſaid ſhe, mildly; "I had heard how partial you were to ſleeping at the mill cottage, and I took a ride to ſee if you were well accommodated; but I found the bed intolerable, and the houſe in ſuch a miſerable ſtate, I thought you ran great riſques of getting cold, ſo, being unwilling to loſe you, I thought it was my duty, as a good wife, to provide you with better conveniences."</p>

But I charge you, Barton, delay not a day to make her a proper ſettlement, leſt you hereafter grow weary of her, and fall a victim to poverty and infamy: ſhe is a beauteous flower, pity it is ſhe was ever tranſplanted into the garden of folly."</p>

Thomas replied in the affirmative, and Dolly being found no ways unwilling to comply, a few weeks made them man and wife; Barton deſiring his Lady to ſpare no expence neceſſary to make them quite comfortable, and literally kept his promiſe of never ſeeing Dolly again.</p>
               <p>But though his reſolves, in regard to future conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were ſeriouſly made, his heart was compoſed of ſuch inflammable matter, that he no ſooner began to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the unaſſuming charms of Rebecca, which, from being much at home, he had now ſufficient leiſure to do than he found himſelf puzzled to keep his good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and being unaccuſtomed to combat his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he found this firſt attempt at ſelf-conqueſt too painful to be perſevered in: and Mrs. Barton, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of heart, ſaw he was again relapſing into indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>Rebecca too ſaw, with evident diſpleaſure, the many opportunities he took of throwing himſelf in her way. It was ſometimes impoſſible to avoid liſtening to him on a ſubject which filled her with diſguſt and ſorrow. He offered her ſeveral valuable trinkets, which ſhe reſolutely refuſed to accept; but at length his behaviour became ſo unequivocal, that Rebecca determined to quit her amiable miſtreſs, however unwilling to relinquiſh a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in which ſhe had enjoyed ſo much tranquillity.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barton quickly diſcovered the motives of our heroine's intention, and honoured her for them.</p>
               <p>"You are a truly amiable girl, Rebecca," ſaid ſhe, "and I will not part with you till I can recommend you to ſome perſon who will be ſenſible of your value."</p>
               <p>The next morning Mrs. Barton informed her that, during a viſit ſhe had made the preceding afternoon, ſhe had heard of a ſituation which ſhe thought might prove highly advantageous to her. "But perhaps," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſhe, "you would not like to leave England."</p>
               <p>"All places are alike to me," ſaid Rebecca; "I have ſo very few friends who intereſt themſelves at all in my welfare, that provided my mother gives her aſſent, I can
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:027651_0110_0FD564D9908366D8"/>
have no objection to quitting a place where every tie is broken that once rendered it moſt dear to me."</p>
               <p>"Well then," ſaid Mrs. Barton, "there is a young lady who has been in England for her education; ſhe is now about ſixteen years old, of an amiable temper, and highly accompliſhed. Her father, who reſides in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, has ſent for her home, and her governeſs has been inquiring for a prudent well educated young perſon to accompany her. The terms offered are fifty guineas, and all expences paid, and ſhould you not approve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding there, on your arrival, they will pay your paſſage back again.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Abthorpe is a man of large fortune; he has formerly ſerved in the army, but at the concluſion of the war reſigned his commiſſion, and retired to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, his lady being a native of that place. Miſs Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe goes out in about ſix weeks, and if you ſhould like to accompany her, I have no doubt but you are the kind of perſon that will ſuit her."</p>
               <p>Rebecca was pleaſed with the propoſal; ſhe waited on the lady with whom Miſs Abthorpe had been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and was highly approved of, both by her and the young lady herſelf. She then wrote to her mother, and in a few poſts received a letter dictated by her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but wrote by her ſiſter-in-law, and written in ſuch cold ſlighting terms that ſhe eaſily ſaw they would be glad to have her ſo far from them, that there might be no danger of her coming home, in caſe of ſickneſs or other contingencies ſhe therefore took leave of the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mrs. Barton, who could not part from her without tears, and who preſented her with ſeveral valuable memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of her friendſhip.</p>
               <p>The day after Rebecca entered Miſs Abthorpe's ſervice ſhe ſet off for London, where ſhe was to join Mr. Seward's family, who were to embark on board the ſame ſhip with her, and under whoſe protection ſhe was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to New-England. It was late in September when they arrived in town, and a variety of incidents detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them till the middle of October, ſo that they had but an untoward proſpect before them, when ſo late i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the ſeaſon they embarked at Deal, on board a brig bound for Boſton. A fair wind preſently took them out of the channel, and they flattered themſelves with a proſperous voyage; but theſe flattering appearances were ſoon reverſed, for the wind ſuddenly changed, riſing almoſt to a hurricane, ſo that it was impoſſible to purſue their intended courſe or return to port, and they continued toſſing about in the Atlantic till the latter end of December, and then had not half made their paſſage, though their proviſion was ſo exhauſted that they were obliged to live on a very ſmall allowance of bread; water and ſalt meat they had, and a few peaſe, but of theſe they were extremely careful.</p>
               <p>Poor Rebecca heartily wiſhed herſelf on ſhore again, but ſenſible thoſe wiſhes were unavailing, ſhe confined them to her own boſom, and exerted herſelf to ſupport the ſpirits of Miſs Abthorpe, who, naturally delicate and unaccuſtomed to fatigue, was nearly exhauſted with terror, confinement and hunger. In a few weeks they were reduced almoſt to extremities; they had not even a candle to light the binnacle, which contains the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and the whole of their allowance now amounted to one biſcuit and half a pint of water per day each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

Mr. Seward took his little girl in his arms, his two boys hung on each ſide of him; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored at a look of fortitude, but the guſhing tears betrayed the anguiſh of the paternal heart. Rebecca ſeated herſelf on her bed, Miſs Abthorpe looked up in her face for comfort, but ſhe had none to offer; ſhe ſighed and reſted her head on Rebecca's ſhoulder.</p>
               <p>"What ſhall we do," ſaid ſhe, mournfully.</p>
               <p>"Truſt in God," replied Rebecca, faintly, preſſing her hand."</p>
               <p>Miſs Abthorpe returned the preſſure, and they joined in fervently committing themſelves to the protecting care of him who could ſave to the uttermoſt.</p>
               <p>Ten days more paſſed on in this dreadful manner, when another veſſel was diſcovered, but, alas! Hope refuſed to cheer their boſoms with the fainteſt ray.</p>
               <p>"We muſt make an attempt to move their compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, however," ſaid the maſter. Mr. Seward aſſented
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:027651_0113_0FD564E1A7B0C440"/>
to the propoſal, and they mounted the deck together; but Rebecca and her young lady ſat penſive and ſilent; they hardly dared to hope, and the ſweet comforts of religion forbade them to deſpair.</p>
               <p>The noiſe on the deck prevented their hearing what was ſaid, or whether any anſwer was returned to their entreaties. In a few moments the noiſe increaſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to tumult, a confuſed ſhout broke forth, which the poor liſtening females miſtook for a murmur of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and diſappointment.</p>
               <p>"They have refuſed us," cried Miſs Abthorpe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to riſe from her bed.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid they have indeed," ſaid Rebecca; but "do not you attempt to go on deck—ſtay here and I will go and enquire." With tremulous and unequal ſteps after repeated attempts, Rebecca, reached the gangway. She was juſt trying to mount the ſteps, when her intent was fruſtrated by a ſudden motion of the ſhip, and ſhe fell down. "Heaven preſerve me!" ſaid ſhe, as ſhe ſlowly aroſe.</p>
               <p>"Heaven has preſerved us all," ſaid Mr. Seward, as he deſcended the ſteps," for look, my good girl, what a dinner its bounty has ſent us."</p>
               <p>At that moment a ſtrange ſailor came down with a large wooden bowl, in which was a fine piece of boiled beef, ſome potatoes, and a peaſe pudding.</p>
               <p>"God bleſs your pretty hearts," ſaid the ſailor, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round at Rebecca, Miſs Abthorpe, and the young Sewards, "come fall too and lay in a good cargo for according to the log your are light enough now.",</p>
               <p>"You have robbed yourſelves, I fear," ſaid Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; "this was intended for your dinners."</p>
               <p>"That is neither here nor there," ſaid he, putt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large quid of tobacco in his mouth; and ſplit my topſails if I would not rather rob myſelf any time than ſee a brother ſailor want a dinner. D—e we ſoon emptied the copper when we heard how cloſe hauled you were, and ſet old ſtoke gally to work to cook more; we brought enough for all, and they have fallen too above board like a parcel of hungry ſharks."</p>
               <p>

               <p>The freindly ſailors now departed, having taken an inventory of what was moſt requiſite for the releif of their brethern, and in about an hour and a half returned with their captain, and a ſupply of bread, cheeſe, meat, butter, and candles, alſo a ſmall quantity of ſpirituous liquors to refreſh the ſailors.</p>
               <p>"We muſt give you a bill on the owners," ſaid Mr. Seward, when he had taken an account of the ſtores brought on board.</p>
               <p>"No," replied the generous captain, "I ſhall take no bill. I expect no reward. I may one day be in the ſame ſituation, and have only done as I would be done by."</p>

voyagers began to think of landing that evening, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver late it might be when they arrived; but as the night came on, the wind increaſed, accompanied by ſnow and ſleet; the cold at the ſame time being intenſe, it froſe as it fell, and in a very ſhort period the ropes about the ſhip were ſo incaſed with ice, that they became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable; the darkneſs increaſed, and to add to their diſtreſs, they loſt ſight of the light houſe at the entrance of the harbour.</p>
               <p>Their ſituation was now imminently dangerous: driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the wind, among a multitude of rocks and breakers, without the leaſt chance of avoiding them: to be ſhipwrecked in the very ſight of home, was a painful trial indeed, yet this was what all expected, and for which all endeavoured to prepare themſelves with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient reſignation.</p>
               <p>About ten o'clock all their fears were realized, and a ſudden ſhock convinced them they had ſtruck on ſome rocks. The enſuing ſcene from that time till ſeven the next morning is better imagined than deſcribed, for till that time they had no proſpect of relief, but continued beating on the rocks, the waves waſhing over them, and expecting momentary diſſolution. As the day-light advanced they diſcovered the iſland from which the reef ran, to be inhabited<note n="*" place="bottom">Lovel's Iſland.</note>. Several muſkets were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſcharged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſignals hung out, and about eight o'clock they diſcovered people coming to their aſſiſtance. It was impoſſible to bring a boat near the veſſel, but the tide beginning to leave her, the men waded into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and placed a ladder againſt her ſide, down which the fear of immediate death gave Miſs Abthrope and Rebecca courage to deſcend; but what were the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mr. Seward, when he found the impoſſibility of his little daughter's going down, ſo dangerous was it rendered by the ice that enveloped the ſteps of the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and from whence, if ſhe fell, ſhe muſt have been daſhed to pieces or loſt among the rocks; nor did he dare to venture to deſcend himſelf with her in his arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

leſt a falſe ſtep or ſlip might deſtroy them both. But there was no time for much deliberation, as it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to leave the ſhip before the tide returned. At length an old ſailor offered an expedient which was thought feaſeable; and the agitated parent faſtened a ſtrong cord round the waiſt of his child, by which he lowered her down the ſide of the veſſel; the old ſailor caught her in his arms, and bore her exultingly to the ſhore.</p>
               <p>A new world now opened on Rebecca, who, when ſhe was a little recovered, beheld with aſtoniſhment how every object was bound in the frigid chains of winter. The harbour, which ſhe could ſee from the houſe on the iſland, was one continued ſheet of ice. The face of the country was entirely covered with ſnow, and from the appearance of all around ſhe could form no probable hope of getting to Colonel Abthorpe's till the genial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſpring ſhould unbind their fetters; but in this ſhe was agreeably miſtaken, for the inhabitants of thoſe cold climates being accuſtomed to the weather, were quick in expedients to facilitate their conveyance from one place to another. The very next morning a boat was procured, and men being placed at the head, to break the ice as they proceeded. By two o'clock, on the thirtieth of January, our heroine found herſelf once more on terra firma, comfortably ſeated before a large wood fire, in Colonel Abthorpe's parlour; for during their voyage Miſs Abthurpe had conceived ſuch an eſteem for her, that ſhe inſiſted on her being conſidered as her friend and ſiſter, and her parents had too high a reſpect for their daughter, to wiſh to contradict ſo laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a deſire.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ATLANTIC.</head>
               <p>ON the left hand of the entrance of Boſton harbour is a beautiful little peninſula, called N—; it conſiſts of two gradually riſing hills, beautifully diverſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with orchards, corn-fields and paſture land. In the valley is built a little village, conſiſting of about fifty houſes, the inhabitants of which could juſt make ſhift to decently ſupport a miniſter, who on a Sunday aſcended the pulpit in a ruſtic temple, ſituated by the ſide of a large piece of water, nearly in the middle of the village, and taught, to the utmoſt of his abilities, the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of chriſtianity. The neck of land which joins this peninſula to the main is extremely narrow, and indeed is ſometimes almoſt overflown by the tide. On one ſide it forms a charmingly pictureſque harbour, in which are a variety of ſmall but delightfully fertile iſlands, and on the other it is waſhed by the ocean, to which it lays open. In this enchanting village ſtood Mr. Abthorpe's houſe, in the midſt of a neat and well cultivated garden; and here it was that, as the ſpring advanced, our contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heroine beheld with rapture the rapid progreſs of the infant vegitation; for the earth ſeemed hardly releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the fleecy garb of winter, before it burſt forth in the full bloom of vernal pride.</p>
               <p>In this agreeable ſituation Rebecca remained nearly two years, enjoying as much felicity as ſhe could expect in the friendſhip of Mr. and Mrs. Abthorpe and the affection of their amiable daughter. It is true ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſighed when ſhe thought of Sir George Worthy— ſometimes gazed on his portrait and that of his mother's, till her eyes overflowing could no longer diſtinguiſh them. But theſe were luxuries, too dangerous to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten indulged, they only ſerved to enervate her mind, and render her incapable of enjoying the bleſſings pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

of Providence; ſhe therefore exerted her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good ſenſe to keep theſe acute ſenſibilities within proper reſtrictions, and by ſtriving to be happy in her preſent ſituation, in a great meaſure rendered herſelf really ſo. She had many admirers, and might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into matrimonial engagements greatly to her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but ſhe reſolutely refuſed them all, ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining towards each that invariable politeneſs and frankneſs of demeanor, as at the ſame moment extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed their tenderer hopes and yet conciliated their eſteem.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of this time ſhe had received two letters from Mrs. Barton, and one from her mother; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer informed her, that her huſband was entirely reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe was the happieſt woman in the creation, and that ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould one day have Rebecca a witneſs to her felicity; the contents of the latter was not ſo pleaſing; her mother complained of ill treatment from her daughter-in-law, and extravagance in her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; at the ſame time ſhe informed her, ſhe had juſt lain in of a boy, who ſhe hoped would be the comfort of her old age.</p>
               <p>"I wiſh to heaven he may," ſaid Rebecca, then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the letter and reflecting how many leagues ſhe was from her only ſurviving parent; that perhaps ſhe might be in heavy affliction, ill treated by thoſe on whom ſhe had placed the firmeſt reliance, laughed at by the world, and not unlikely pinched by poverty. The gentle-hearted girl burſt into tears; "Ah!" ſaid ſhe, "why did I leave my native country; I ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that my poor mother had no real friend but me, on whom ſhe could ſafely rely for comfort in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or affliction; I ſhould have remembered, that though ſhe had preferred the friendſhip of others to mine, it was ſtill my duty not to leave her expoſed to misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which my preſence and tender aſſiduities might have alleviated."</p>

ſhape, began to ſtalk over this once happy land. Ere this, the inhabitants of New-England, by their hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and primitive ſimplicity of manners, revived in the mind of our heroine the golden age, ſo celebrated by poets. Here were no locks or bolts required, for each one, content with his own cot, coveted not the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his neighbour; here ſhould a ſtranger make his appearance in their little village, though unknown by all, every one was eager to ſhew him the moſt civility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inviting him to their houſes, and treating him with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delicacy the ſimplicity of their manner of living af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded.</p>
               <p>The only houſe of entertainment in this village, had ſcarcely cuſtom ſufficient to ſupply its venerable miſtreſs with the neceſſaries of life; but ſhe had a garden, a cow, and a few acres of land; the produce of theſe were ſufficient to her wants and wiſhes, and ſhe would ſit in her matted arm chair, in a room whoſe only beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was "the white-waſhed wall, the nicely ſanded floor," while the ſmile of content played about her face, and while ſhe thankfully enjoyed the bounties of heaven, ſhe remembered not that any could be richer or happier than herſelf.</p>
               <p>But when fell diſcord ſpread her fable pinions and ſhook her curling ſnakes, how ſoon this bliſsful proſpect was reverſed; frighted at the horrid din of arms, hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality fled her once favourite abode, mutual confidence was no more, and fraternal love gave place to jealouſy, diſſention, and blind party zeal. The ſon raiſed his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed arm againſt his parent, brothers drenched their weapons in each other's blood, and all was horror and confuſion. The terrified inhabitants of N— left the village and took refuge in the more interior parts of the country, all but Colonel Abthorpe's family who ſtill remained, though deſerted by all their ſervants; for the Colonel had too high a regard for his royal maſter to join the cauſe of his enemies, and it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>It was a ſtill morning about the latter end of July, when Rebecca, being diſturbed by ſome little ruſtling at her window, raiſed her head, and by the faint dawn that juſt glimmered from the eaſt, diſcovered armed men placed round the houſe. Alarmed, ſhe ſtarted from her bed and awoke Miſs Abthorpe; they threw a few clothes over them and flew to the Colonel's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They were met by Mrs. Abthorpe, who caught her daughter in her arms, and, pointing to the room where they uſually ſlept, cried, "Look Sophia, your poor father."</p>
               <p>Miſs Abthorpe looked and beheld two ſoldiers with firelocks, who placed at the door of the apartment, held her father a priſoner.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear mother," ſaid ſhe, "who are theſe, and what are they going to do; ſurely, ſurely they will not murder us."</p>
               <p>"Don't frighten yourſelf, Miſs," ſaid one of the officers, "we do not uſually murder ſuch pretty girls."</p>
               <p>"But my father," cried ſhe, eagerly, "what do you intend to do with him."</p>
               <p>"Set him at liberty again when our expedition is over."</p>
               <p>Rebecca now learnt that theſe were a part of the American army, who had come to N— in whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats, with a deſign of dragging their boats acroſs the beach before mentioned, and proceeding to the light-houſe at the entrance of the harbour, intending to deſtroy it, in order to miſlead the expected releif that was coming to Boſton which was at that time blockaded: they had before made an unſucceſsful attempt to demoliſh this light-houſe, and were now come reſolved not to leave their work unfiniſhed; accordingly they proceeded as quiet as poſſible to the beach, almoſt carried their boats over, and arrived totally unexpected at the little iſland on which the light-houſe ſtood, and which was guarded by a party of marines. A ſmart ſkirmiſh enſued, but the Americans were too numerous to be withſtood by ſo
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:027651_0121_0FD564EF54A1EFC8"/>
ſmall a party; the whole of which they either killed or took priſoners; and having completed their deſign, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to N—, victorious, though in the utmoſt conſternation, for fear of being purſued by boats from the Lively frigate, and other ſhips that lay in the harbour.</p>
               <p>Rebecca was ſtanding at a window as they relanded, the tears ſtreaming down her pale face, and ſo entirely abſorbed in terror that ſhe was inattentive to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding objects. From this ſtate of torpor ſhe was arouſed by a deep groan, and raiſing her eyes, ſaw two Americans entering the houſe, bearing between them a wounded marine, whom they laid on the floor, and were preparing to depart, when Mrs. Abthorpe ruſhed out of the adjoining apartment.</p>
               <p>"What are you doing?" ſaid ſhe, "you will not ſurely leave him here."</p>
               <p>"D—n him," cried a wretch, "he is in our way; if he don't die quickly we will kill him."</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not kill me!" ſaid the almoſt expiring ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; "I am not fit to die."</p>
               <p>At this moment Major Tupper entered: Mrs. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe addreſſed him in a ſupplicating accent; "We can procure the poor ſoul no aſſiſtance," ſaid ſhe; "he will periſh for want of proper applications to ſtanch the blood."</p>
               <p>"My dear madam," ſaid the Major, "what can we do; we fear purſuit, and muſt retreat as faſt as poſſible, and ſhould we take him with us, in our hurry and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he will perhaps be precipitated into eternity. If we make a ſafe retreat I will ſend to morrow." He then departed, and Colonel Abthorpe being now at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, turned his thoughts toward the wounded ſoldier.</p>
               <p>He had fainted, a mattreſs was laid on the ground, and as they all united in endeavouring to remove him upon it, the motion increaſed the anguiſh of his wounds and recalled his languid ſenſes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Spare me! do not kill me!" ſaid he looking round with a terrified aſpect.</p>
               <p>"Be comforted," ſaid the colonel; "you are among friends, who will do all in their power to ſave your life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:027651_0122_0FD564F0CD1D5C60"/>"God will reward you," ſaid he, faintly.</p>
               <p>They now examined the wound, and found, from its depth and ſituation, that a few hours would terminate the exiſtence of the poor ſufferer: however they made long bandages of linen, and with pledgets dipped in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, endeavoured to ſtanch the bleeding, but in vain.</p>
               <p>"I am very faint," ſaid he.</p>
               <p>Rebecca knelt and ſupported him in her arms, aſſiſted by the weeping Sophia.</p>
               <p>"Can I live, think you, Sir?" ſaid he, looking wiſhfully in the Colonel's face.</p>
               <p>"I fear not," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"God's will be done," ſaid he; but I have a long account to ſettle, and but a ſhort time to do it in. Dear good Chriſtians, pray with me—pray for me. Alas, it is an awful thing to die, and with the weight of murder on my conſcience." Here he grew faint again and ceaſed to ſpeak. A cordial was adminiſtered —he revived.</p>
               <p>"You ſee before you, my kind friends," ſaid he "a moſt unhappy man, the victim of his own folly. My father is a clergyman in the North of England; I am his only child, and have received from him an education ſuitable to the ſtation in which he meant to have placed me, which was the church; but, alas, I deſpiſed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and joined myſelf to a ſet of the moſt diſſolute companions, with whom I ran into every ſpecies of vice and debauchery.

He looked round, and fixing his eyes on Rebecca and Sophia, "Poor girls," ſaid he, "you are but young, take the advice of a dying ſinner, and treaſure it in your memories: obey your parents, never forſake them, and ſhun vicious company, for had I done this it would have been well with me in this evil day."</p>
               <p>Rebecca's ſuſceptible heart ſmote her, ſhe hid her face with her handkerchief, and ſighed deeply.</p>
               <p>"God for ever bleſs you, my friends," ſaid he; "I am going, a few pangs more, and all will be over. Oh, may he whoſe fatal aim took my life have it not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered againſt him; may the Father of mercy forgive him as freely as I do."</p>
               <p>He then began to repeat the Lord's Prayer, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired before he could finiſh it.</p>
               <p>"Peace to his repentant ſpirit," ſaid the Colonel, as he raiſed his weeping daughter from her knees.</p>
               <p>"His poor father," ſaid ſhe, "what would he feel, did he know this."</p>
               <p>"He felt more," replied the Colonel, when the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided youth forſook the paths of virtue, than he would, could he even behold him now.</p>
               <p>The heat at this ſeaſon of the year is intenſe, and the Colonel knew the body of the unhappy ſoldier muſt that day be conſigned to the earth, yet how to make the grave, or how to convey the corpſe to it when made were difficulties which he could hardly think it poſſible to ſurmount, but ſad neceſſity enforced the attempt; he fixed on a retired ſpot, juſt by the ſide of his garden, and began the melancholy taſk. Rebecca and Sophia with their delicate hands endeavourd to aſſiſt, and by evening they had completed it.</p>
               <p>The faint rays of the ſetting ſun juſt tinged the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the higheſt hill; the ſky was ſerene, and ſcarce a breeze was heard to move the leaves or ruffle the ſmooth ſurface of the water. Awfully ſolemn was the ſilen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:027651_0124_0FD564F7729FC720"/>As the Colonel ſat penſively conſidering his ſituation, and thinking how in the decenteſt manner poſſible he could render the laſt ſad duties to the deceaſed, he ſaw a ſmall fiſhing boat, with one man in it, drawing near the ſhore; he ran haſtily down, entreated him to land and aſſiſt him in his mournful office.</p>
               <p>The body was carefully wrapped in a ſheet—it was impoſſible to obtain a coffin.</p>
               <p>"We have no clergyman," ſaid the Colonel, "but the prayers of innocence ſhall conſecrate his grave."</p>
               <p>He gave the prayer book to Sophia, ſhe opened it, and with her mother and Rebecca followed the body. She began the ſervice, but her voice faltered, the tears burſt forth, ſhe ſobbed, and could no longer articulate. The Colonel took it from her; he was a man of undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courage in the day of battle, but here even his heart ſunk and his voice was tremulous; but he recalled his fortitude and finiſhed the ſolemn rite in a becoming manner.</p>
               <p>"What a day has this been," ſaid Sophia, as they were partaking a little refreſhment.</p>
               <p>"It has been a heavy day indeed my child," ſaid Mrs. Abthorpe, "but how much heavier would it have been, had the poor departed been related to us by any ties of blood: had he been a father, a huſband, or a brother. Think not of the evils we endure, my dear Sophia, but reflect how much more painful our ſituation might be than it is, and offer up your thanks to your Creator, that our afflictions do not exceed our ſtrength, and that in this ſolitary place we enjoy health and ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mind."</p>
               <p>"Ah," ſaid Rebecca, mentally, "I do not enjoy that ſerenity, for my mother, in affliction, in want, and calling in vain upon her daughter for comfort, is ever preſent to my imagination."</p>
               <p>For ſeveral weeks the ſolitude of Colonel Abthorpe was undiſturbed, and Autumn began to advance. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He would gladly have gone to the britiſh troops, but had no poſſible means of conveying himſelf and family to them, and his heart revolted from the thought of going to reſide with the enemies of his ſovereign; however they gave him not the choice, for the latter end of October they diſpatched a party, conſiſting of a captain, lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and fifty men, who ſurrounded the houſe of the defenceleſs Colonel, making himſelf, his wife, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and our heroine priſoners, on pretence of his having held correſpondence with the enemy.

They would then, as the progreſs of the ſpring invited them, wander out to a neighbouring wood, the borders of which were waſhed by a narrow arm of the ſea; they would ſit on its banks, watching the unſtable element as it ebbed or flowed, and admiring the rich beauties of the ſurrounding proſpect. Their hearts were innocent. Youth, health and exerciſe, gave them a flow of ſpirits, and often as they ſat would they war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſome innocent cheerful air, or in an evening hymn of thankſgiving, lift up their ſouls to their Creator.</p>
               <p>But when the ſummer was paſt, and winter in its dread array drew near, when the pinching blaſts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember pierced bleakly through the crevices of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable habitation, and there was neither fire or neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry food to alleviate the horrors inſpired by the gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſeaſon, then it was their ſpirits began to flag.

               <p>It was a cold evening, the ſnow fell faſt, a very ſmal portion of ſire glowed on the hearth, and the little light in their apartment proceeded from a ſmall lamp that was placed on a deal table; beſide which ſat Colonel Abthorpe, his head reſted on his hand, his eyes fixed in mournful contemplation on the altered face of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved wife, who, ſeated oppoſite to him was diligently employed in knitting, while Rebecca and Sophia were ſpinning, in hopes, by the produce of their labours to increaſe the ſmall, <hi>very</hi> ſmall ſhare of comforts they enjoyed.</p>
               <p>"It is very cold to night," ſaid the Colonel, caſting a melancholy look at the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:027651_0127_0FD564FC0CCC8CE0"/>"I have felt it colder," replied his Lady, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at a ſmile; "beſides the room is ſmall, and a little fire warms it."</p>
               <p>"To be ſure," cried Sophia, "and then, while I am at work, I never think of the cold; but I am afraid of Rebecca; ſhe is more delicate than I am."</p>
               <p>"Your fears are needleſs, my love," replied our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine. "I ſhould not mind the inclemency of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was your dear mother only comfortable."</p>
               <p>"We think our ſituation hard," ſaid Mrs. Abthorpe, "what then is the ſituation of the poor ſoldiers engaged in the war?"</p>
               <p>"Poor fellows," ſaid the Colonel, paſſing his hand acroſs his forehead, to conceal the rheum that diſtilled from his eyes.</p>
               <p>At that moment the door of their apartment opened, and a ſtranger entered without ceremony.</p>
               <p>The Colonel aroſe. Mrs. Abthorpe bowed her head in token of ſalutation, and the young ladies ſuſpended their work.</p>
               <p>The ſtranger drew a chair. "You do not ſeem to be comfortably ſituated, Colonel," ſaid he, as he ſeated himſelf, and caſt his eyes round the room.</p>
               <p>"No," replied the Colonel, with a deep drawn ſigh, "comfort and I have long been ſtrangers to each other."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Abthorpe looks ill," ſaid the ſtranger; "has ſhe had any advice?"</p>
               <p>"The humanity of ſome friends, Sir, have procured her every medical aſſiſtance; but, alas! in vain—the malady is ſeated in her mind."</p>
               <p>"I was enquiring about you the other day," ſaid the ſtranges, "and was ſorry to hear you were ſo badly ſupplied with the neceſſaries of life. A plan has ſince ſtruck me by which you may be relieved from theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and reſtored to the eaſe and affluence you have heretofore been accuſtomed to enjoy."</p>
               <p>This was at once calling forth the attention of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. Mrs. Abthorpe raiſed her languid eyes to his face, Sophia and Rebecca inſtinctively drew near, the Colonel liſtened in ſilence, and the ſtranger proceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:027651_0128_0FD56501A781C8E8"/>"Our army is at preſent in want of experienced offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: You do not hold any commiſſion under the King of England?"</p>
               <p>"But I have eat his bread, Sir," ſaid the colonel, haſtily.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Abthorpe ſighed, and relapſed into her accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed penſive ſtate.</p>
               <p>"If you would accept a commiſſion in our army," ſaid the ſtranger, "your property would be again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ample compenſation made for the loſſes you have ſuſtained."</p>
               <p>The Colonel ſhook his head, and made a rejecting motion with his hand.</p>
               <p>"You will be raiſed to a rank ſuperior to any you have held in the Britiſh army, and your name will be immortalized as one of the glorious ſupporters of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican liberty."</p>
               <p>The colonel frowned contemptuouſly, and was going to ſpeak, but the ſtranger interrupted him:</p>
               <p>"You will have the felicity of ſeeing your amiable wife and lovely daughter enjoying again the comforts and elegancies of life. Pleaſure will once more inhabit their boſoms, and enliven their features."</p>
               <p>The Colonel gazed tenderly on his wife and daughter, pauſed, and ſeemed irreſolute. Mrs. Abthorpe read his heart.</p>
               <p>"And what," ſaid ſhe, addreſſing the ſtranger, "are the elegancies of life, when the mind no longer retaine its own approbation. It is true, Sir, the preſent change in our circumſtances has awakened ſome painful ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but it has not made us unhappy. I do not repine, for, though unfortunate, we are not deſpicable; our integrity has ever been unſhaken, and, I truſt, will ever remain ſo."</p>
               <p>"True my love," ſaid the colonel, recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "we will bear the preſent evils patiently, and hope for better days in future."</p>
               <p>"But I would have you weigh this matter maturely, Colonel," ſaid the ſtranger, "before you pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:027651_0129_0FD56502D4ECA8B0"/>"I have weighed it, Sir. You will pardon my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptneſs, and am determined to reject every offer that would tend to draw me from the loyalty I owe the beſt of ſovereigns; and allow me to ſay, I conſider ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers as inſults to my honour."</p>
               <p>"It is well, Sir," ſaid the ſtranger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> riſing, "if your reſolution is taken, I will ſay no more on the ſubject; but you will pleaſe to prepare your family for leaving this place to-morrow. You are to be conveyed twenty miles farther into the country."</p>
               <p>"Farther into the country. Sir!" ſaid the Colonel, ſtarting. "My wife is unable to bear the journey."</p>
               <p>Sophia turned deathly pale, and left the room with Rebecca.</p>
               <p>"Do not be uneaſy, my dear Abthorpe," ſaid the amiable wife; I make no doubt but he, who for his own wiſe purpoſes, ſuffers us thus to be afflicted, will endue me with ſtrength of mind and body to hear it as becomes a Chriſtian."</p>
               <p>The ſtranger walked acroſs the room. He was a man of feeling, and had very unwillingly undertaken his commiſſion. He was poſſeſſed of every virtue that could alleviate the human heart. He had been taught to think the cauſe, in which he was engaged, was a right cauſe. He was young; his boſom glowed with enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic ardour. Can we blame him? for, though attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the cauſe of his country, he was ſtill more ſo to that of humanity."</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry," ſaid he; but a diſagreeable oppreſſion upon the lungs prevented his proceeding farther.</p>
               <p>The Colonel involuntarily took him by the hand: "And had you, my dear Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been tempted to deſert your country's cauſe? What ſays your heart? Would private intereſt have triumphed over the ſpirit patriotiſm that now animates your boſom?"</p>

<pb n="131" facs="unknown:027651_0130_0FD5650460A4EF00"/>
"Let thoſe bluſh," ſaid he, mentally, who, "cannot ſympathize with an afflicted fellow creature."</p>
               <p>"But ſuppoſe," ſaid Mrs. Abthorpe, laying her hand on his arm, for he had mechanically ſtopped beſide her, — "Suppoſe, Sir, you had a wife, who would feel more for your deviation from rectitude, than ſhe would to endure the hardeſt pangs of poverty and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and who would rather die than ſee you an apoſtate to the cauſe you had vowed forever to eſpouſe."</p>
               <p>He turned abruptly from here ſomething that ſpoke within forbade him to anſwer.—</p>
               <p>"And what have I done," ſaid the Colonel, "that I muſt leave a place where I have experienced ſuch friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſuch diſintereſted affection, from many of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants?"</p>
               <p>"You are too near the ſea coaſt," ſaid the ſtranger, and may hold correſpondence with the enemy."</p>
               <p>He averted his eye from the Colonel's, face, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to conſult his watch, "It is later than I thought," ſaid he, endeavouring at indifference in his voice and manner.</p>
               <p>"At eight o'clock to-morrow I expect you will be removed. God bleſs you, my dear madam," reſpectful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking Mrs. Abthorpe's hand.</p>
               <p>She ſaw the feelings of his ſoul depicted in his face, and forbore to encreaſe them by unneceſſary complaint.</p>
               <p>"The change of air may do me good, Sir," ſaid ſhe with a ſmile of complacency; "for it often happens that what we dread as an evil, in the end contributes to our advantage."</p>
               <p>He gazed on her with a look of reverence and wonder, bowed profoundly, and, unable to articulate another ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, haſtily left the room.</p>

Rebecca and Sophia aſſiſted Mrs. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe to alight; gloomy as was the outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their deſtined habitation, the inſide ſerved only to increaſe their horror; it conſiſted of three rooms.

               <p>They heard footſteps approach—the Colonel's well known voice ſaluted their ears.</p>
               <p>"Dry your eyes, my dear girls," ſaid Mrs. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe; "Let us not increaſe his ſorrows, whoſe every pang is doubled by our ſufferings."</p>
               <p>The Colonel entered, ſome one accompanied him for they could hear more than one footſtep.</p>

a word of praiſe or thanks; they ſoon cheered the ſolitary manſion with a comfortable fire; in the mean time a ſmall cart arrived with two beds, a few chairs, and ſome kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en utenſils. From a baſket in this cart the young men produced a couple of fowls, ſome butter, bread, and two bottles of wine, ſo that in leſs than two hours, from their firſt melancholy entrance, our diſtreſſed family were ſeated in homely wiſe round an old wainſcot table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a large fire, partaking a plentiful ſupper, while their hearts expanded with gratitude to that good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence who had raiſed them up friends when leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

               <p>But this is a theme which carries me from every other. I would requeſt pardon for digreſſing my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but I know thoſe only will blame me, who never felt the ſweet emotions of unbounded gratitude.</p>
               <p>But to return.—</p>
               <p>The habitation to which Colonel Abthorpe had been thus ſuddenly removed, was ſituated on the ſkirts of an extenſive wood. The face of the country was rocky and dreary, to which unpromiſing appearance the ſnow and ice not a little contributed. There was but one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation within two miles of them, and that was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by people, if poſſible more wretched than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>In this diſmal ſituation, with no amuſement but what ſprang from themſelves, for they had not even the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of books, did the Colonel and his family paſs four weariſome months, during which time they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten no food but coarſe Indian bread and potatoes; nor any firing but what Sophia and Rebecca aſſiſted each other to bring in their delicate arms from the adjacent woods, for the Colonel himſelf was great part of that time conſined to the houſe with the gout; and in their daily excurſions to procure this neceſſary appendage to the ſupport of life in ſo cold a climate, they had no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to their feet, which often bled from the intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the cold, or from inciſions made by the rugged path over which they were obliged to paſs.</p>
               <p>It was the latter end of March, the ice was beginning to diſſolve in the warmth of a mid day ſun, when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, willing to enjoy a ſhort ſpace of uninterrupted reflection, ſallied into the woods, unaccompanied by Miſs Abthorpe. As ſhe gathered up ſome ſcattered branches, and laid them together, her thoughts wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to her native land. She retraced every event of her paſt life: "And where now is Sir George?" ſaid ſhe. "Could he behold me at this inſtant, how would his generous heart compaſſionate my misfortunes; but, alas! perhaps I am no more remembered by him,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:027651_0135_0FD5650D7A7D1948"/>
or he conſiders me as numbered with the dead; and am I not ſo to him? Then, why ſhould I wiſh him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me in his mind, when, by forgetting me, he may regain that felicity his generous ſentiments in my favour had interrupted. No doubt, he is long ſince married to the Lady with whom his mother wiſhed him to unite. Ah! my beloved benefactreſs," continued ſhe, ſitting down on a large ſtone at the foot of a ſpreading pine, "dear Lady Mary, little did you think when I parted from you we were never more to meet! But that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of heart would from that hour be the unremitting portion of your Rebecca."</p>
               <p>She then drew forth the picture, which, through all her diſtreſs, ſhe had ſtill carefully preſerved, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly carried about her in a ſmall purſe, in which ſhe had alſo depoſited Sir George's letter, and thoſe ſhe had received from her mother. As ſhe opened this precious repoſitory, her mother's writing caught her eye.</p>
               <p>"My poor mother," ſaid ſhe—"what waves, what inſurmountable waves, now roll between us! Shall I ever again behold you? Or is it my fate here, far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from my native land, to end an exiſtence, which though ſhort, has been marked by variety of ſorrow?" Here painful remembrance over-powered her. She reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her cheek on her hand, and as ſhe held the picture in the other, alternately raiſed her ſtreaming eyes to heaven, and then fixed them on the portrait of Sir George.</p>
               <p>She was arouſed from this painful reverie by a deep drawn ſigh, which ſeemed to proceed from a perſon very near her, and, ſtarting, ſaw a venerable old man ſtanding oppoſite her, habited in a lieutenant's dirty uniform.</p>
               <p>She aroſe, and, tying her bundle of wood together, was preparing to lift it, when the old officer approached.</p>
               <p>"It is too heavy for you, child," ſaid he; "give me l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>"I have not far to go, Sir," ſaid Rebecca.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you are going by the unfortunate Colonel
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:027651_0136_0FD5650ECE12EF90"/>
Abthorpe's habitation, or can direct me where to find it?"</p>
               <p>"I live in his family," ſaid Rebecca, eagerly. "Do you know him, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"Alas! no, my dear child; but hearing he was a priſoner at this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being myſelf in the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy predicament, I am going to claim his ſociety, hoping that, as brothers in affliction, we may be enab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to comfort each other: But, ſurely, I have ſeen you before, though where or when I can by no means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect."</p>
               <p>"Your features too," ſaid Rebecca, "ſeem fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to me, yet I do not think we ever met before."</p>
               <p>They had now reached the houſe, and depoſiting their burthen at the door, entered.</p>
               <p>"You will pardon me, Sir," ſaid the old lieutenant, advancing to the Colonel, "if I, unaſked, intrude my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into your dwelling; but hearing there was an officer in this place, I could not reſiſt the deſire I felt to be known to him."</p>
               <p>"And by what name am I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>"My name is Littleton."</p>
               <p>"Littleton!" cried Rebecca, ſtepping eagerly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>"Yes, George Littleton," ſaid the Lieutenant. I have worne his Majeſty's livery above twenty years.</p>
               <p>"My name is Littleton," ſaid Rebecca.</p>
               <p>"And your father's name?"</p>
               <p>"Was William.—</p>
               <p>"He is dead, then," ſaid Mr. Littleton, with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed look.</p>
               <p>Rebecca's tears confirmed the ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>"And did you never hear him ſpeak of a brother?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but as of one long ſince dead."</p>
               <p>"Alas! he thought me dead, but I am that brother; nor can I doubt but you are his child, you bear ſo ſtrong a reſemblance to him. My dear girl," continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, embracing her, "how my heart bleeds to meet

               <p>"Diſappointment and vexation," ſaid the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "drove me from my native country; the loſs of a wife and child, whom I tenderly loved, diſguſted me with life, and I ſhipped myſelf to the Eaſt-Indies, from whence I hoped never to return."</p>

               <p>Such was Roſa Benſon, when at the age of eighteen ſhe was ſent for from France, where ſhe had been educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to take the care of her father's houſe, her mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

been taken ſuddenly off by an appoplexy. I was juſt two years older, and could not behold unmoved, the innumerable charms that were daily diſplayed by this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging girl. She performed on the harpſichord with great taſte and execution, had a ſoft melodious voice, and ſung with judgment. Her mind had been carefully cultivated, which rendered her a well informed rational companion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benſon generally ſpent his evenings abroad, and I frequently paſt many hours in uninterrupted converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the charming Roſa.</p>
               <p>I will not pretend to delineate the various imperceptible degrees by which our hearts became attached to each other: Suffice it to ſay, we felt the power of love min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the pureſt friendſhip; nor did we once reflect on the imprudence of indulging our ſenſibility till awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened from our dream of bliſs by Mr. Benſon informing his daughter, that her hand was ſolicited by an Earl, and that he had given him leave to addreſs her; at the ſame time he gave her to underſtand, he did not expect any oppoſition to his will, and flattered himſelf he ſhould ſoon behold her a Counteſs.</p>
               <p>When Miſs Benſon informed me of this unexpected ſtroke, I felt as though annihilated: I threw myſelf at her feet, and entreated her not to make me the moſt wretched of human beings by accepting my noble rival. She aſſured me ſhe had too high a ſenſe of honour to give her hand to one man, while her heart was entirely devoted to another, but ſtill I was unhappy; nor did I ceaſe ſoliciting the dear girl till ſhe conſented to be mine by the ſtrongeſt of all ties, and by a private marriage I ſecured to myſelf, as I then thought, the moſt perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent felicity.</p>
               <p>Still the Earl continued his aſſiduities: but Roſa found means to evade her father's earneſt wiſhes, and a more wealthy woman falling in his lordſhip's way, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, ſhe was for that time delivered from farther impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>About ſix months after our marriage, it became neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Mr. Benſon to ſend a perſon to the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:027651_0139_0FD56516EE9D1330"/>
with powers to ſettle ſome buſineſs with the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants there: It was a lucrative employment. He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to my uncle that I might, if I choſe, undertake the voyage. My uncle acquieſced. There was no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative, and I was under the neceſſity of leaving my wife, whom I could by no means perſuade to accquaint her father with our marriage previous to my departure.</p>
               <p>During my abſence I was much ſurprized at receiving no letters from my dear Roſa; but as I was ſenſible there might be various cauſes for this apparent neglect, it only ſerved to render me more attentive to my buſineſs, as I knew the ſooner it was finiſhed, the ſooner I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the wife of my choice, the freind of my boſom. At length it was completed, and I returned to my native land, after being abſent from it about thirteen months.</p>
               <p>Eagerly did I count the minutes whilſt travelling from Deal to London; and when the chaiſe ſtopped at Mr. Benſon's door, my heart throbbed with ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence that I could hardly ſpeak. I alighted, and ran haſtily up ſtairs; but was much ſurpriſed, on entering the drawing-room, to ſee a ſtrange Lady there, young handſome, and elegantly dreſſed. Mr. Benſon mention<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed her as his wife.</p>
               <p>"And where is Miſs Roſa?" ſaid I.</p>
               <p>"She is not at home," replied Mr. Benſon, coolly; "but, come Littleton take your tea, and then we will go into the counting houſe, and talk over buſineſs."</p>
               <p>Conſcious as I was of the near intereſt I took in every thing that concerned Roſa, I forbore to mention her again, leſt the agitation of my mind ſhould be betrayed by my countenance; I took my tea in ſilence, and then deſcended with my maſter to the counting-houſe, where, in as conciſe a manner as poſſible, I gave him an account of the buſineſs I had been ſent upon, and delivered to him all the bills and other papers I had brought with me from Jamacia; this employed us till near one o'clock in the morning, and, fatigued as I was, I could not but be ſurpriſed that my hitherto indulgent maſter ſhould have no thought of the long voyage and journey I had juſt arrived from, and that I certainly required reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="unknown:027651_0140_0FD5652903F87AC0"/>When we had entirely finiſhed, he thus addreſſed me:</p>

It is to your arts I owe her refuſal of the Earl of—, and had ſhe not been your wife, ſhe would at this moment, have been a Dutcheſs."</p>
               <p>I had ſat as one petrified during this ſpeech; but on his again calling me by the opprobious names already mentioned, I rouſed myſelf, and endeavoured to anſwer; but his paſſion, like a torrent, bore down all before it, and I was obliged to be ſilent. At length he told me he had diſclaimed his daughter, that he had ſent her from his houſe, and would never give her a ſingle far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no not even to keep her from ſtarving.</p>
               <p>"But go," continued he, "go to her, and may you both, with your brat, ſtarve together."</p>
               <p>The mention of a child operated on my nerves like a ſtroke of electricity. "And where are they, Sir?" ſaid I, ſtarting from my ſeat, "where are my Roſa and her infant?"</p>

               <p>He then flung out of the room, and I too much irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to remain in a houſe where I had been ſo ill trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was preparing to leave it, when the door opened, and one of the houſe maids entered, looking carefully round her.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you are come, Sir," ſaid ſhe; "my poor young Lady will rejoice to ſee you."</p>

               </p>
               <p>"George," ſaid ſhe, putting her dear boy into my arms, "you are come home in time to receive this pledge of my love, and to cloſe my eyes; but I ſhall die content, ſenſible that you will be a kind father to my child."</p>
               <p>I endeavourd to cheer her, and inſpire her with hopes which I could not rationally indulge myſelf. I procured the beſt medical advice, but all in vain; ſhe grew worſe and worſe, and expired in leſs than a fortnight after my arrival in England.</p>
               <p>Previous to her death ſhe informed me that another, ſtill more ſplended, offer of marriage, ſtrenuouſly urged by her father, had wrung from her the ſecret of our marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and that ſhe was immediately diſmiſſed from her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe in the moſt diſgraceful manner; that ſhe had wrote to my uncle, claiming his protection-if not on her own account, for the ſake of the unborn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; but his anſwer was, that as I choſe to marry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſulting him, I might maintain my wife as I could for he would never more do any thing for me; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="143" facs="unknown:027651_0142_0FD565194C24BFD8"/>
I went to him ſoon after the death of my wife, I was not permitted to ſee him.</p>
               <p>About this time your father, who was then an enſign in a marching regiment, was ordered to Ireland. I had not ſeen him for ſome years, as he had been ſtationed at Plymouth; but could not let him leave the kingdom without taking a perſonal leave: I therefore left my dear boy with the good woman where my Roſa had lodged, and ſat off for that place.</p>
               <p>I had not been with my brother above three days, before I received a letter from the nurſe, informing me that my boy had been carried off by a convulſion fit the day after I left Windſor. The world now appeared to me an univerſal blank. I conſidered myſelf as a mere cypher, without family, connexion or friends, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing but a ſmall portion of wordly goods. I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an acquaintance with ſeveral officers belonging to one of his Majeſty's ſhips going to China; a deſire of roving took poſſeſſion of my mind. I had, when a boy, been fond of the ſtudy of mathematics, and during my voyage to Jamaica, had contracted a fondneſs for a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical life, I therefore requeſted to be admitted on board the Triton, and was accepted.</p>
               <p>In this ſhip I went to the Eaſt-Indies, fully reſolved never to viſit England again. This reſolution I kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate for many years, always, changing into ſome ſhip ſtationed in thoſe parts whenever the one I was in was remanded home. In his Majeſty's ſervice I aroſe by degrees to the rank of lieutenant, and my ambition had led me to hope, during this war, I ſhould have riſen ſtill higher, for the ſhip I was in, being ordered home, and I unable to obtain an exchange into one ſtationed in India, I returned to England, and was ſoon after ſent in a cutter with expreſſes to the fleet at New-York, from whence I was diſpatched to Boſton, where I unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately arrived after the evacuation, of his Majeſty's troops, and of conſequence fell into the hands of the enemy. I have been detained a priſoner now near two years, frequently removed from one place to another, and every removal is ſtill for the worſe; but I hear there
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:027651_0143_0FD7C1DBABC73AC8"/>
is now an exchange of priſoners talked of, ſo I hope to be included in the cartel.</p>
               <p>"But did you never write to my father;" ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca.</p>
               <p>"Yes, frequently, during the firſt year of my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from Europe; but never receiving any anſwers, owing, as I imagined, to the unſettled life a ſoldier in general leads, I at length ceaſed to write. When I was laſt in England I enquired for him of ſome of our old friends, and learned that he was married, and had one child; but they could give no information where he was ſettled, as they had neither ſeen or heard from him for many years."</p>
               <p>Rebecca felt a gleam of comfort dilate her affectionate heart, at having thus unexpectedly found a relation: "I am not then entirely unconnected," ſaid ſhe, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, at the ſame time laying her hand on that of her uncle, and looking at him with eyes ſwimming in tears of filial tenderneſs, excited by the ſtrong reſemblance he bore to her father.</p>
               <p>"My dear girl," ſaid he, "you have found an old uncle who will love you with all his heart, and defend you to the laſt hour of his exiſtence; but I am as poor, Rebecca, as when I firſt put on his Majeſty's livery. In all my long ſervicce I have not picked up above two hundred pounds prize-money, and, thinking I had no one to take it after me, I have ſpent it as faſt, or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſometimes faſter than I gained it. But my pay has been running ſo long, we ſhall be quite rich when I get home, and you ſhall call me father, and make up to me the loſs of my Roſa and her boy."</p>
               <p>"I will be your daughter in every ſenſe of the word," ſaid Rebecca, affectionately kiſſing his hand.</p>
               <p>The converſation now took a more general turn: Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Abthorpe was delighted with the acquiſition of a friend. They could not think of parting till evening, nor then without a mutual promiſe of maintaining a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent intercourſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII. WE COME HOME AGAIN.</head>
               <p>WHEN Colonel Abthorpe retired to reſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in his mind what Mr. Littleton had ſaid concerning an exchange of priſoners. His wife's decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning health had long made him uneaſy. He flattered himſelf was he once removed from captivity, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to obtain ſubſiſtence for his family, her mind would be more at eaſe, and ſhe would of conſequence reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her health and ſpirits. Theſe reflections occupied him all night, and totally baniſhed ſleep. At dawn of day he aroſe, and ſat down to draw up a petition, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be, with his family, included in the intended exchange.— This petition he preſented to the ſelect-men of the place, to be by them tranſmitted to the general court. The anſwer he received was a repetition of the offers of employment in the American army, enforced with promiſes of the moſt beneficial and lucrative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for his ſervices. Theſe he ſtrenuouſly rejected, declaring a reſolution to die rather than forſake the cauſe of loyalty.</p>
               <p>They found it was in vain to increaſe either their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of affluence, or their ill treatment; he was alike unmoved by either, at leaſt he did not ſuffer them to perceive the effect his miſeries had on his mind. If he ſighed it was in ſeeret, and he waited with an aſſumed patience the end of his misfortunes, while the moſt afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſations corroded in his boſom: But when he had almoſt bidden adieu to hope, when deſpair ſeemed to have taken poſſeſſion of his mind, then was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence neareſt at hand, and he received a letter, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him he was to be exchanged with his family by the very next cartel. They were accordingly removed to Boſton, and, in company with Mr. Littleton, put on board a ſmall veſſel, bearing a flag of truce, in which they arrived, after a ten days paſſage, ſafe at Hallifax.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:027651_0145_0FD565201211F618"/>Here Mr. Littleton was immediately employed, and drew on his agent for money to provide himſelf and Rebecca with neceſſaries; nor did he withhold part of his little ſtore from Colonel Abthorpe, who was really in neceſſitous circumſtances. Mrs. Abthorpe's malady had gained too much ground on her delicate conſtitution ever to be repelled. She continued to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and, in a few weeks after their arrival in Nova-Scotia, ſhe ſunk to eternal reſt! Rebecca exerted her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to comfort poor Sophia; but it was now become abſolutely neceſſary for them to part. Colonel Abthorpe had not the means even of ſupporting himſelf and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, much leſs an extra perſon: Beſides, Rebecca was eager to reviſit England, and ſee her mother; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore furniſhed her with recommendatory letters to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ladies in London. Her uncle provided her a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and gave her an order on his agent for the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of all his worldly wealth. She took an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate leave of her dear Miſs Abthorpe, and embarked for her native land. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſeemed as though the elements were as eager to convey our heroine in ſafety home, as they had been perverſe and tardy in bearing her from thence; for on the twenty-eighth day from her leaving Halifax, at the cloſe of the evening, ſhe found herſelf ſet down at the door of the Croſs-Keys Inn, in Grace-church ſtreet, London. She had landed with a widow lady and her maiden ſiſter (who came in the ſhip with her) at Deal, and they had proceeded to town in a poſt-chaiſe. She remained at the inn with them that night, and the next morning took a coach to ſeek the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent friend of Mrs. Harris in the Borough. She was removed, but Mrs. Harris herſelf occupied the houſe: Rebecca therefore, met a hearty welcome, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take up her abode with her till ſhe could hear from her mother, to whom ſhe immediately wrote.</p>
               <p>Anxiouſly did ſhe count the time till ſhe thought it poſſible to receive an anſwer. At length the welcome ſound of a poſtman's rap ſaluted her ears. She almoſt flew to the door. The letter required double poſtage; ſhe paid it without heſitation, and haſtily returned to
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:027651_0146_0FD565219C7395A8"/>
the parlour to examine its contents; but as ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the candle, what were her feelings to diſcover it was her own letter returned, with theſe words written on the outſide:—</p>
               <p>"Removed to London two years ago!"</p>
               <p>"To London!" ſaid Rebecca; "but what part of London? Good heavens! that I ſhould be in the ſame place with my mother, and yet unable to find her! But, perhaps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have no mother now," continued ſhe, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:— "She has been removed two years; alas! ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may have levelled her with the duſt long ſince."</p>
               <p>She then endeavoured to recollect ſome perſon in her native village, to whom ſhe could addreſs herſelf, in hopes of gaining information whether her mother had mentioned what part of the town ſhe intended to reſide in. At length ſhe recollected the parents of Ruth, who had lived ſeveral years ſervant in the family, and was with them when her father died. To them ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately wrote, and, as early as ſhe could poſſibly expect, received the following anſwer: <floatingText type="letter">

                        <p>"This comes with father and mother's kind love to you, letting you know that we are all main glad to hear you are alive, and come home again to old England, for, certain ſure, we all thought you had been dead along while ago; ſo when father put on his ſpectacles, and began to read your letter, I thought as how I ſhould have ſounded for joy; for indeed, and for ſarten, Miſs Becky, I would walk a many long miles to ſee your ſweet face. Oh! dear, if you was but as rich, and as happy as you are good, and as we all wiſh you.—</p>
                        <p>"As to your mother, we are deadly afraid ſhe has made but a poor hand of marrying again, for old Serl was but a ſhabby kind of body, though he pretended to

               <p>When Rebecca had finiſhed reading this letter her mind was in a ſtate of anarchy, better imagined than deſcribed. She ſat with the letter open on the table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her—her hands folded in each other—her eyes fixed on vacancy.</p>

               <p>"He is married," replied Rebecca unconſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.—</p>
               <p>"Well, child, you knew that before, I thought."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed; this is the firſt I ever heard of it."</p>
               <p>"Why, how you talk!" ſaid Mrs. Harris, ſtaring at her; "to my certain knowledge ſhe wrote you word of it herſelf."</p>
               <p>"Who wrote me word of it?"</p>
               <p>"Why, your mother, child."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my mother," cried Rebecca, endeavouring to rally her ſcattered thoughts; then, pauſing for a moment, "my poor mother," continued ſhe, burſting into tears, I fear I ſhall never ſee her more."</p>
               <p>There was a wildneſs in her looks, an incoherence in her manner, that alarmed the compaſſionate Mrs. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.

This was a conduct more congenial to the mind of Rebecca than the moſt eloquent harangue could have been.

               <p>WHEN Rebecca had repelled the violence of her firſt emotions, on finding Sir George was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt to her, her mother's unfortunate marriage, and its conſequences recurred to her mind, ſhe retired to bed, but not to reſt; ſleep was a ſtranger to her eyes, and
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:027651_0149_0FD56527313361F8"/>
her thoughts were ſo harraſſed, that in the morning her heavy eyes, pale lips, and burning hands, alarmed Mrs. Harris.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, child," ſaid ſhe, gently ſhaking her, "I muſt not ſee you in this way; you are far from well now, and if you go on fretting thus, I ſhall have you quite laid up. You muſt rouſe yourſelf, my dear; it is very wrong to give way to ſorrow for misfortunes that are irremediable.—Chance may, perhaps, diſcover in what part of the town your mother is; in the mean time you muſt not neglect your own intereſt. You have never yet waited on any of the ladies to whom Colonel Abthorpe gave you letters. I will have you dreſs yourſelf this very day, and go to ſome of them. Perhaps you may meet with a ſituation where, by your mind being conſtantly occupied, you will have no time to fret yourſelf to death, which I foreſee will be the caſe if you are left to yourſelf."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Mrs. Harris, I have no cauſe to wiſh for life," ſaid Rebecca, in a melancholy accent, "for, in the whole world, I have no friend but you and my poor uncle; him, perhaps, I ſhall never ſee again, and you, I fear, will grow weary of ſuch a child of ſorrow."</p>
               <p>"Now you are very unkind, Rebecca, to ſuppoſe me capable of neglecting you, or being wearied by your complaints! No, my child, I feel for you every thing that friendſhip and affection can feel for a beloved object; and it is becauſe I think it neceſſary to your health that you ſhould be rouſed from this ſtate of inaction, that makes me willing to be deprived of your ſociety: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, my dear, your mother may be, nay, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, is alive, and, at ſome future period, you may have it in your power to render her happy and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in her latter hours by your tenderneſs and filial love: For her ſake, then, exert your natural good ſenſe, and bear your afflictions with becoming reſignation; it is an indiſpenſable duty you owe to her, to yourſelf and to your Creator."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mrs. Harris," cried Rebecca, "pardon my petulance; I ſee the friendly deſign of your advice, and will exert myſelf to follow it."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="unknown:027651_0150_0FD56529CD381FF0"/>She now began to look over her letters, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to wait that morning on Lady Winterton and Mrs. Sackville, who lived both in a ſtreet near Cavendiſh ſquare. She had two more letters, but they were to ladies in the city.</p>
               <p>Rebecca's dreſs was plain and neat in the extreme, yet there was a dignity in her perſon and manner that ever commanded reſpect: She, therefore, on knocking at Lord Winterton's door, was immediately uſhered into a parlour, and the ſervant took the letter to his Lady.</p>
               <p>The Lady was at her morning toilet. She caſt her eyes haſtily over the letter.</p>
               <p>"What kind of a perſon brought this, Thomas?" ſaid ſhe to the man who waited juſt without the door of the dreſſing room.</p>
               <p>"A very genteel young woman," replied the man.</p>
               <p>"Well, ſhew her into the breakfaſt parlour, and tell her I ſhall be with her preſently. Is my Lord up?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my Lady, he is juſt gone down."</p>
               <p>"Well, go, do as I bid you."</p>
               <p>The man departed, and Rebecca was deſired to walk into a parlour, where in his night gown and ſlippers, ſat a perſonage, the exact counterpart of Lord Ogleby in the Clandeſtine Marriage.</p>
               <p>Rebecca ſtarted, and was going to retire.</p>
               <p>"Pray, Madam," ſaid my Lord, riſing, "do not let me frighten you; my Lady will be here directly. Thomas, a chair for the young Lady."</p>
               <p>Rebecca bluſhed, courtſeyed, and took her ſeat.</p>
               <p>My Lord eyed her attentively. She felt her confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on increaſe.</p>
               <p>"She is a very fine girl," thought his Lordſhip; I wonder who the devil ſhe is."</p>
               <p>"The weather is very fine for the ſeaſon, Madam," ſaid he, thinking it was incumbent upon him to ſay ſomething, though, in fact, it had rained inceſſantly for a week.</p>
               <p>"The ſun did break out for about an hour this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;" ſaid our heroine, half ſmiling; "but he ſeems to have withdrawn himſelf again."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:027651_0151_0FD5652B977A21C0"/>"He was conſcious, Madam, that when your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were viſible to the admiring eyes of mortals, his fainter glories could not be miſſed."</p>
               <p>"Heavens!" thought Rebecca, "what a ridiculous old man, with his bombaſtic compliment: However, I am glad he is old; perhaps his Lady may want a perſon to read to her, or by cheerful affiduity, otherwiſe amuſe her. She had, in her own mind, pictured Lady Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton as an elderly Lady, perhaps upwards of ſixty, years old. In this family," thought ſhe, "ſhould I be ſo happy as to be placed, I ſhall be free from the noiſe and impertinence ſo frequently to be met with in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of young people of quality. I dare ſay they do not keep much company; nay, perhaps, live in the country above half the year. I wiſh I may ſuit her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip; ſhe certainly wants ſomebody, either for herſelf or ſome of her freinds, by her deſiring me to wait to ſee her."</p>
               <p>As Rebecca was indulging theſe reflections the door opened, and a Lady entered, in appearance not more than twenty, habited in a very modiſh undreſs.</p>
               <p>"Miſs Littleton, I preſume," ſaid ſhe, advancing— Rebecca courtſeyed.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Abthorpe," ſaid the Lady, motioning for her to be again ſeated, "has had a very diſagreeable time in America. I dare ſay you are happy to find yourſelf in England again."</p>
               <p>"Sincerely ſo, Madam."</p>
               <p>"This thought Rebecca, is undoubtedly a daughter."</p>
               <p>"The Colonel mentions," reſumed the Lady, "that you would wiſh to engage as companion to an elderly Lady, or as governeſs to ſome genteel family of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren."</p>
               <p>"Either ſituation would ſult me, Madam," ſaid Rebecca; and if Lady Winterton could recommend me—."</p>
               <p>"Lady Winterton wants a companion herſelf," ſaid the Lady, ſmiling; "but, perhaps, her age will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Diſappointment and ſorrow ſoon put a period to her exiſtence. My father continued in poverty, but I was committed to the care of my wealthy aunt.</p>
               <p>"At that time I became acquainted with Lord Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton, my father's circumſtances were dreadfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed. My aunt would not advance a ſingle guinea to keep him from a gaol. I knew this marriage would place him in affluence, and at the age of ſixteen, gave my hand, promiſed to love and obey, before my heart knew what love was. I have been married now five years; my temper is naturally cheerful, and I am an enemy to thought; but I have that within me which convinces me I have a heart alive to every delicate ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſintereſted tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>"You may, perhaps, think it odd, that I am thus open to a ſtranger; but Colonel Abthorpe, who was the intimate friend of my father, has given you a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as bade me to wiſh to make an intereſt in your heart, that I may ſay I have one boſom in which I can repoſe my ſorrows, one friend who will pity my frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties."</p>
               <p>Rebecca felt inclined to love this unfortunate young creature from the firſt moment ſhe beheld her. A very few words ſerved to ſettle every preliminary, and it was agreed that the very next day ſhe ſhould repair to her new ſituation.</p>
               <p>As the time allowed her was ſo very ſhort, Rebecca thought ſhe would make uſe of the reſt of that day to

deliver all the other letters; "for," ſaid ſhe, "it is right that I ſhould wait on theſe Ladies, though I am ſettled with Lady Winterton; they may at ſome future period be of ſervice to me." She accordingly repair'd to Mrs. Sackville's.</p>
               <p>Being ſhewn into the drawing-room, a tall, meagre figure preſented itſelf, who ſcarcely deigned an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the head as ſhe took the letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, waving her hand, cried, "Sit down young woman."</p>
               <p>Having read the letter—"And ſo you have been in America, child? cried the Lady, with the ſame ſolemn aſpect. "Well, I dare ſay, they are all in fine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion there; but let their diſtreſs be ever ſo great, it is no more than they deſerve, a parcel of <hi>rebels.</hi>"</p>
               <p>"They may have been miſled," cried Rebecca, an enthuſiaſtic ardour animating her expreſſive counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; "but they are in general a brave, benevolent ſet of people."</p>
               <p>"'Tis a pity, as you are ſo partial, you had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained amongſt them."</p>
               <p>"I had no friends there, Madam, and wiſhed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my native country."</p>
               <p>"Nay, you have not many friends here," ſaid the Lady, with a ſarcaſtic ſmile, "according to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's account."</p>
               <p>Rebecca's eyes filled with tears.—Mrs. Sackville con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued: "I do not know of any body at preſent who wants a young perſon of your deſcription."</p>
               <p>"You will pardon me, Madam," ſaid Rebecca, for this intruſion; "I did it merely in reſpect to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attention of Colonel Abthorpe, who furniſhed me with ſeveral letters; but I have been ſo fortunate as to be engaged this very morning as companion to Lady Winterton."</p>
               <p>"'Tis very well," ſaid Mrs. Sackville, toſſing her head: "Lady Winterton, I believe, wanted a <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient</hi> friend, and very poſſible you may ſuit her purpoſe: However young woman, do not ſay you go into her family without knowing what kind of a woman ſhe is.

She then rang the bell, and Rebecca depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no very high opinion of her good nature, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever her other virtues might be.</p>

               <p>WHEN Rebecca began to feel herſelf ſettled in Wimpole-ſtreet, ſhe alſo began to find that ſhe had entered on an entire new life.—Lady Winterton was
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:027651_0156_0FD5653572B44920"/>
extremely gay, ſaw a great deal of company, and lived in one continued round of dreſſing, viſiting, and public amuſements. It was in vain for our heroine to object to accompanying her; ſhe had taken a peculiar fancy to her ſociety, and was never happy without her. Lord Winterton loved gaiety, and an oſtentatious diſplay of grandeur as well as his Lady: She was therefore never abridged in her pleaſures, were they ever ſo extravagant, and the old Peer thought himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ply repaid for the moſt ſplendid entertainments, or elegant preſents, by the ſmiles and good humour of his Lady, who, in ſpite of her caprice and ſatyrical wit, he tenderly loved.</p>
               <p>One morning Rebecca had accompanied her Lady to an auction, where they had ſcarcely been ſeated ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes before a very elegant young man approached them, and being introduced to her as a Mr. Savage, a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friend of her Ladyſhip's, attached himſelf to them the whole morning.—Rebecca did not obſerve any thing uncommon in his attentions to Lady Winterton, but ſhe thought, as he handed her Ladyſhip to her carriage, ſhe ſaw him put a folded paper into her hand, which ſhe immediately conveyed into her pocket.</p>
               <p>As it drew towards evening the Lady ſeemed vaſtly uneaſy, eſpecially when ſhe found her Lord meant to ſpend his evening at home: however, after ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her tea, ſhe ordered her chariot.</p>
               <p>"Am I not then to have the pleaſure of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>"Oh! my Lord, I ſhall be home again in about two hours. Miſs Littleton and I are only going to call on a ſick friend of her's."</p>
               <p>Rebecca ſtared. Lady Winterton gave her a ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating look, and, ſurpriſed as ſhe was, ſhe remained ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>"If Miſs Littleton wiſhes to viſit her friends," ſaid my Lord, "the chariot is certainly at her ſervice; but, ſurely, my dear Fanny, you are not obliged to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her."</p>
               <p>"Indeed but I am! and I am ſenſible the Lady will
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:027651_0157_0FD56537D2E288A0"/>
take it very unkind were I to neglect going. Don't you think ſhe would, Rebecca."</p>
               <p>"I think," ſaid Rebecca, timidly, "we may both venture to defer our viſit till the morning, as my lord is ſo kind as to ſpend the evening at home."</p>
               <p>"Ah! that is your good nature, my dear; you would rather offend your friend, than lead me to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige my huſband; but ſuppoſe we ſettle it this way: I will go and ſee how the lady is, and you ſhall ſtay and engage my Lord at piquet. I ſhall juſt call at my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua-maker's in my way home, and be with you again before ſupper."</p>
               <p>"Your Ladyſhip will pardon me," ſaid Rebecca, giving her a penetrating look: "If you are reſolved to go, you ſhall not have to ſay I am remiſs in the duty I owe my friend. I am ready to attend you, Madam," riſing, and ringing for her cloak.</p>
               <p>"For heaven's ſake! Lady Winterton," ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, as the chariot drove from the door, "what is the meaning of all this? You have diſtreſſed me beyond meaſure, by calling on me to aſſert a falſhood."</p>
               <p>"Now you are angry with me, Rebecca," ſaid the Lady, taking her hand; "but pray think no more about it: I could contrive no other means to get away from that inquiſitive old man, without telling him where I was going."</p>
               <p>"And ſurely your Ladyſhip does not wiſh to go any where that would be offenſive to your huſband."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my dear girl, you will never forgive me, you are ſuch a prudent creature yourſelf; but I am going to meet —, though, believe me, it ſhall be the laſt time. I am going to meet —, and take a laſt farewell of Savage."</p>
               <p>"By your Ladyſhip's promiſing it ſhall be the laſt time, I am led to think it is not the firſt. I could have excuſed your making me acceſſary to ſuch an affair: However, I ſhall take care not to be liable to be drawn in a ſecond time."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Miſs Littleton, you have no compaſſion for a ſuſceptible heart."</p>

                  </gap>, Lady Winterton, I have, an infinite deal; I feel for you ſincerely, if when your perſon is united to one, your heart is in the poſſeſſion of another. Your feelings, Madam, are involuntary; your actions are by no means ſo: I am ſenſible you may not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the weakneſs of your heart; but you certainly may avoid throwing yourſelf into ſituations which may lead to criminality."</p>
               <p>The chariot ſtopped—Lady Winterton alighted —and Rebecca followed her ſilently into a parlour, where Savage was eagerly expecting her.</p>
               <p>The enſuing ſcene, to which our heroine was a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though it awakened all her compaſſion for the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who in years, ſentiments and manner, ſeemed ſo ſuitable to each other, it gave her but an indifferent opinion of her Lady's prudence. Savage, from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, appeared a man of ſtrict honour; he did not ſeem to entertain an idea to the injury of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; but that unfortunate woman, hurried on by the violence of her paſſion, made a thouſand diſcoveries of her unbounded affections, which, with a man of leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, might have precipitated her into everlaſting infamy.</p>
               <p>The promiſe of returning to ſupper was entirely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got. Rebecca reminded her of the hour: ſhe heard her not, and the clock ſtruck twelve before ſhe could bring herſelf to leave her lover.</p>
               <p>During their ride home Rebecca ſpoke not a ſyllable except one or two laconic anſwers to her Lady's queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. She followed her into the hall, and, taking a candle from a ſervant, wiſhed her a good night, and ran haſtily up ſtairs, leaving Lady Winterton to make her excuſes to her huſband for her breach of promiſe.</p>

               <p>"And how do find yourſelf this morning, my dear?" ſaid her Ladyſhip: "I vow you quite frightened me laſt night."</p>
               <p>"Are you often taken in ſuch a ſtrange manner?" ſaid his Lordſhip, with a look of concern.</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, my Lord; I was taken quite by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe laſt night, and found myſelf very painfully affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I never was taken that way before, but I have felt a return of the diſorder this morning."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" cried her Ladyſhip, viſibly alarmed.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Madam; but as change of air may be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me, and your Ladyſhip ſeems terrified on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I ſhall beg leave to retire to a friend's I have ſome few miles from town. I ſhall go directly after breakfaſt, and will ſend to-morrow for my trunks.</p>
               <p>"You do not mean to leave us, I hope?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Madam; I feel it impoſſible for me to remain with you any longer." Lady Winterton burſt into tears.</p>
               <p>"Nay, Miſs Littleton," ſaid his Lordſhip, "you muſt not leave us; my poor Fanny will break her heart."</p>
               <p>It was to no purpoſe for the Lady to weep, or her huſband entreat: Rebecca remained inexorable, till Lord Winterton leaving them, his Lady earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to forgive what was paſt, and ſhe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee Savage again.</p>
               <p>"Do not leave me, Rebecca," ſaid ſhe; "you are my guardian angel; without you I ſhall be inevitably loſt!"</p>
               <p>This argument prevailed, and Rebecca conſented to ſtay, in hopes of drawing her Lady from her unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate attachment.

               <p>Rebecca had left her Lady in an alcove at the bottom of the garden, and wandered into the pleaſure ground.</p>
               <p>The beauty of the ſurrounding ſcene had given a ſoft ſerenity to her mind, and ſhe ſat down to indulge reflections, which, if not abſolutely pleaſant, were far from painful.</p>
               <p>She had not ſat long before ſhe obſerved two men gliding among the trees, and proceeding as it were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the garden. At firſt ſhe felt rather terrified, but the idea of Savage ſtriking her, ſhe haſtened toward the place where ſhe had left her Lady. She had hardly got half way before ſhe felt herſelf ſuddenly ſeized by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who ſoftly bid her not be alarmed, he only meant to prevent her diſturbing an agreeable <hi>tete a tete,</hi> to which a friend of his had been invited, and which he was determined ſhould not be interrupted by her.</p>
               <p>Rebecca trembled exceſſively, for, by the voice, and what little ſhe could diſcern of his features, ſhe diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the perſon who held her to be no other than Lord Oſſiter.</p>
               <p>"Whoever your friend is," ſaid ſhe, "he can have no buſineſs here. Unhand me, Sir, or I will alarm the houſe."</p>
               <p>"You muſt cry pretty loud, then, my dear, for you are a good diſtance from it; but ſtay, have I not ſeen your face before? Yes, by heavens!"</p>
               <p>At that moment, a loud ſhriek from the alcove, and a claſhing of ſwords, made him relinquiſh his hold, and run toward the place from whence the ſound proceeded. Rebecca followed as faſt as her trembling limbs would permit; but what a ſcene preſented itſelf to her view.

               <p>Terrified and diſtreſſed as Rebecca was, ſhe could not but wiſh to ſtay to afford what relief was in her power to her Lady, but this was denied her. She had aſſiſted Savage to bathe her temples with hartſhorn, and ſaw her open her eyes, when the ſervants entered, took her in their arms, and bore her to the houſe, where Rebecca was forbade to enter, and any ſervant who ſhould dare to afford her ſhelter, threatened with inſtant diſmiſſion.</p>
               <p>"What now is to become of me!" ſaid ſhe, ſinking on the ground as the door was ſhut againſt her: "What next will be the fate of the wretched Rebecca."</p>
               <p>"Love, affluence, and pleaſure," ſaid Lord Oſſiter, endeavouring to raiſe her.</p>
               <p>"Say rather death and infamy, my Lord; my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is wounded —my peace of mind deſtroyed. Oh! that my heart would break, and let me reſt forever!"</p>
               <p>"Reſt in my arms," ſaid he, rudely embracing her. She ſhrieked.</p>
               <p>"Forbear, my Lord," ſaid Savage, approaching; "this lady has been the friend of my adored Fanny, and no one ſhall inſult her with impunity."</p>
               <p>"Your humble ſervant," cried Oſſiter; "I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you, and have done, only give me leave to inform you, that this pretty imaculate piece of prudery, about four years ſince, was in a ready furniſhed houſe of my providing, from whence ſhe thought fit to elope, and has, I make no doubt, ſeen a great deal of life ſince that period."</p>
               <p>Rebecca could hear no more—a ſudden chillneſs ran

through her veins—ſhe reſpired with difficulty—her head grew giddy—and ſhe ſunk into inſenſibility. When ſhe recovered, recollection retained but faint traces of the paſt ſcenes; it ſeemed like a diſturbed dream.— "Where am I?" ſaid ſhe.—Lord Oſſiter approached the bed-ſide—"You are in ſafety, my angel," ſaid he, "only compoſe your ſpirits, and nothing ſhall be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that can make you happy." She turned her head from him, wept, but could not anſwer.</p>
               <p>"You muſt not diſturb her," ſaid a medical gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had been called in. "Quiet and reſt is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to preſerve her life."</p>

               <p>Rebecca heard the door ſhut: ſhe raiſed her head to look at the doctor, and perceived, to her great joy, he was a grave, decent looking man. She made ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to ſend the nurſe out of the room; then taking both the doctor's hands in her's, cried, "Oh! good Sir, if you have any compaſſion in your natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"My dear child," ſaid he, "do not alarm yourſelf, you are not in any immediate danger."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Sir, you miſtake me, it is not death I fear, it is diſhonour. Alas! I know not where I am; but I fear I am entirely in the power of a man who will ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me to his unhallowed paſſion."</p>
               <p>"Then you did not come with him voluntarily?"</p>
               <p>"No! no! heaven knows I did not; I was in a ſtate of inſenſibility."</p>
               <p>An intereſting converſation now took place—the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was convinced of Rebecca's innocence, and bribing the nurſe to aſſiſt, about twelve o'clock they helped the poor ſufferer to get on her clothes, ſupported her down ſtairs, and carried her in triumph to his own houſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXI. RETROSPECTION AND NEW CHARACTERS.</head>
               <p>THOUGH Lady Winterton had ſolemnly promiſed Rebecca to hold no farther correſpondence with Savage, her love overpowered every good reſolution, and ſhe had ſeen him ſeveral times previous to their leaving London; for what man of gallantry can refuſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of a woman he tenderly loves, though rigid ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour bids him fly her ſociety. Fanny, the lovely unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Fanny, entreated another interview; it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to avoid it, but each one was meant to be the laſt.</p>
               <p>Lord Oſſiter was by no means the boſom friend of Savage, but he had, by accident, become maſter of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſecret, and was therefore requeſted to accompany him to Chiſwick, where he had enjoyed ſeveral interviews with Lady Winterton before the laſt fatal one.</p>
               <p>Lord Winterton's valet had obſerved his Lady's even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing walks, and made the important diſcovery that ſhe had a lover. He informed his Lord, from that moment her ſteps were watched, ſhe was diſcovered in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cove—Savage at her feet—her cheek reſted on his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head—her hand upon his ſhoulder, and tears were ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Turn, villain," ſaid Lord Winterton, "and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend yourſelf." Savage aroſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drew his ſword; the frantic Lady threw her arms about him, and received her huſband's ſword in her own boſom. She fell, and Oſſiter at that moment entering, prevented the death of her lover, who would certainly have fallen a victim to the huſband's rage, had not timely aſſiſtance arrived.</p>
               <p>The gentle innocent Rebecca was involved in her Lady's crime; ſhe was ſuppoſed acceſſary to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views, and forbade to enter the houſe, when ſhe fainted as was mentioned in the preceding chapter. Oſſiter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:027651_0164_0FD565441CDCB3D0"/>
her to Savage as a woman of a very light cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and he, unwilling to quit a place where he might hope to hear whether his Fanny ſtill lived, ſuffered that deſigning nobleman to carry her to the chaiſe which waited for them, and convey her to the neareſt inn. Here he ordered her to be put to bed, ſent for a doctor, and, having ſtrongly recommended her to his care, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, after a ſlight ſupper, to bed, rejoicing in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which had again put in his power a woman whom, though he had given up all thoughts of gaining, he could never entirely forget.</p>
               <p>How great then was his ſurpriſe when, enquiring for her the next morning, he found doctor, nurſe and patient, all abſconded. He repaired to the doctor's houſe, but could not obtain admittance. He curſed the meddling fellow in his heart, vowed revenge againſt Rebecca, and ſet off for London.</p>
               <p>In the regular cheerful family of Dr. Ryland our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine ſoon recovered her health, and in a great meaſure her ſpirits. She made enquiry concerning the fate of her Lady, and learned that, though ſhe had recovered from her wound, ſhe laboured under a very ill ſtate of health, which, they feared, would terminate in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline. Rebecca gave a ſigh to her hard fate, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe might conquer her paſſion, and be prepared to meet that peace in another world ſhe had failed of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this.</p>
               <p>Dr. Ryland was a truly benevolent man, but he had a large family, and no great degree of practice, it was therefore a thing not to be expected that our heroine could remain with them long, and in the poor ſituation ſhe then was, without money or cloaths, ſhe could not think of returning to incumber Mrs. Harris. She had informed Mrs. Ryland that ſhe wiſhed to get a place in ſome genteel family, where ſhe could render herſelf uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful without much hard labour; that Lady enquired among her friends, and learned that the Lady of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring juſtice wanted a young perſon to get up her ſmall linen, make her caps, bonnets, gowns, &amp;c. and occaſionally to take care of the family when the Lady
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:027651_0165_0FD565458FE42938"/>
was out. Rebecca joyfully waited on Mrs. Penure; the kind Mrs. Ryland accompanied her, gave her ſuch a character as ſhe deſerved, and had the pleaſure to find ſhe entirely ſuited the Lady's plan. The ſalary was ſmall, but Rebecca had but few wants to ſupply; to be neat was now all ſhe required, indeed it was all ſhe could henceforth expect. The doctor advanced a few gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas to provide her a change of clothes, for ſhe had ſent repeatedly, without effect, for her trunk from Lord Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton's, and, in the courſe of a week, from the time ſhe waited on the Lady, Rebecca became an inmate in the family of the worſhipful Juſtice Penure.</p>
               <p>Jacob Penure had, from a very low ſtation in a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table tradeſman's family, raiſed himſelf, by indeſatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble induſtry, to the confidence of his maſter, and a ſhare in the buſineſs, at the age of twenty-three. The fair Miſs Abigail Prune, who had, in the younger part of her life, ſerved ſeveral ladies in quality of waiting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but who now kept her brother's houſe, caſt on him the eyes of affection. Miſs Abigail was to be ſure rather paſt her prime, having ſeen forty ſeaſons revolve, and noted their various change, without the leaſt hope of ever changing her own maidenly condition to the more honourable one of wife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacob was a comely young man. She reviewed her own countenance in the glaſs; ſhe could not but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the traces made by the hand of time. She was above the middle ſize, extremely thin, and had a ſhape, not "ſmall by degrees, and beautifully leſs;" but ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſtraight, that it was impoſſible to perceive the leaſt difference between the bottom and the top, and inſtead of that roundneſs, which conſtitutes elegance in the form of a woman, her waiſt was as perfectly flat as though ſhe had been preſſed between two boards. Her arms were long; her hands large, hard and boney; her face was round, but it was that kind of roundneſs that expreſſes inſignificance. The ſmall remains of teeth ſhe poſſeſſed mignt have been termed beautiful in ſome parts of the world, for they were of jetty hue, and from her hollow ſockets, over which could be diſcerned ſcarcely the trace of brows, twinkled two extremely ſmall black eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:027651_0166_0FD565470FA36330"/>The tip of her diminutive noſe was elevated.</p>
               <p>Her complexion might have rivalled the tints of the moſt beautiful orange lilly.</p>
               <p>Such was the perſon of Miſs Abigail. We will leave her accompliſhments and temper to ſpeak for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jacob Penure knew his own intereſt too well to think of ſlighting the maiden's advances. She had five hundred pounds in her own poſſeſſion, the accumulated ſavings of near twenty years ſervitude; beſides, her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had no children, and he had much money. Mr. Prune was far from diſpleaſed with his ſiſter's choice. Penure was an attentive, induſtrious young man; he made him equal partner with himſelf, and in about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years they found themſelves in poſſeſſion of a very handſome fortune. About this time the old gentleman died. All his poſſeſſions devolved to his ſiſter, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure reſolved, though ſorely againſt his wife's opinion, to leave trade, and retire into the country. Here he was choſen juſtice of the peace, and by his integrity and gentleneſs in the execution of his office, gained the love of all who knew him.</p>
               <p>He was a humane friendly character, but he ſtood in fear of his wife.</p>
               <p>The morning after Rebecca's arrival, the breakfaſt things removed, (for ſhe was to eat at their table,) Mrs. Penure deſired our heroine to accompany her up ſtairs.</p>
               <p>"I am mightily glad," ſaid the lady, ſitting down by a large old-faſhioned caſe of drawers, and taking an enormous bunch of keys from her pocket, "I am migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily glad to have met with a young perſon like you, who can make me up a few ſmart things. I love to be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel, and wear as good things as my neighbours; but really it is ſo expenſive to have any thing done at the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liners, and if one gets any journey-woman to come home, they always aſk for as much again ſtuff as they want, and ſteal half of it. Now I do hate to be cheated: I don't mind giving away a bit of ribband or gauze that is left, but it provokes me to have it taken away ſlyly."</p>
               <p>During this harangue, ſhe had pulled from her draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers an immenſe quantity of yellow waſhed gauze, old
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:027651_0167_0FD565488CAF8730"/>
muſlin, and thread lace, that bore the ſtrongeſt marks of antiquity. She admired the cap our heroine had on, and wiſhed to have one made like it; but among the medley of trumpery ſhe had diſplayed, Rebecca could not ſelect any thing fit for the purpoſe: beſides, our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine's head, though neat and plain, ſtill retained an air of faſhion. Mrs. Penure's lank black hair was combed in the exacteſt manner over a roll, and drawn up as tight behind as poſſible; how then could the ſame cap ſuit both?—However, an attempt muſt be made. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy aſſured Rebecca, that her lace, muſlin, &amp;c. were very valuable, and inſiſted on not only one but ſeveral caps being produced from thoſe materials; at the ſame time ſhe opened a cabinet, in which were arranged, rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the neateſt manner round cards, every ribband ſhe had ever had in her poſſeſſion. "See, young woman," ſaid ſhe, exultingly, "here are variety of ribbands, take your choice, let my caps be trimmed handſomely, but don't waſte any; I hate waſte, ſo, if you can avoid it, don't cut them." Rebecca could not ſuppreſs a ſmile at the ſolemn manner in which this treaſury of old-faſhioned dirty, faded ribbands was committed to her charge. However, ſhe promiſed to exert her abilities to pleaſe, and was beginning to form a cap, but her miſtreſs had not yet done with her. "I ſuppoſe," ſaid ſhe, "you will want linings and wire; beſides, you will not be all day making two or three caps: I want a bonnet or two made, and my beſt cloak freſh trimmed."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid I ſhall not be able to do all in one day, Madam."</p>
               <p>"Well, you muſt do as much as you can, child, don't be idle, I hate idle people. I hope you don't love rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding."</p>
               <p>Rebecca heſitated; ſhe would not utter a falſehood. "I think it an agreeable amuſement, but I will never neglect my buſineſs."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, I hope not, reading is the ruination of all young people. I never read a book in my life but my Bible, and the Houſe-keeper's Aſſiſtant. I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtudying to make the moſt of my time and how to ſave or earn a penny."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="unknown:027651_0168_0FD5654A0C6F7CA8"/>A freſh cargo was now diſplayed to the wondering eyes of Rebecca, of old mode, yellow, white ſarſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>net, ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton wires, paſte board and blond lace, out of which ſhe was deſired to produce a ſmart bonnet or two."</p>
               <p>"It is impoſſible, madam," ſaid ſhe, "utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; the bonnets worn now are ſo different from what were worn ten years ſince. You muſt, indeed, Madam, afford yourſelf new materials to make a genteel bonnet." Her arguments were vain; all ſhe could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was a yard of mode, and four yards of riband, while Mrs. Penure declared ſhe was leading her into extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and that the bonnet muſt laſt her ſeven years.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to give a direct idea of our heroine's ſenſations, when this miſerable woman, out of oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſplayed to her the treaſures of her wardrobe. Here were gowns, petticoats, nay, even ſtockings and linen, which ſhe could no longer mend or wear, careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid by her! Her narrow ſoul could not even expand itſelf to give to others what ſhe could no longer uſe herſelf the very wire that came out of her old caps was twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, kept and put in a box devoted for that purpoſe; hats that bore the date of twenty years by their faſhion; old ſtays, ſhoes and gloves, all were preſerved, though ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth acceptance by the pooreſt perſon.</p>
               <p>Her houſe-keeping was of a piece with the reſt; every thing was under lock and key; bread and ſmall beer were the only things to which the ſervants had free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; her table, it is true, was well ſupplied, but it was oſtentation, not liberality, occaſioned it. Her female viſitors were ſeldom aſked to take more than one glaſs of wine after dinner, for when ſhe had taken half a glaſs herſelf ſhe would return the ſtopper to the decanter, and cry, "I never allow myſelf more," This was the ſignal, and the wine was immediately removed, when ſhe would ſay, "but perhaps, ma'am, you would have liked ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glaſs?"</p>
               <p>It cannot be expected, in ſuch a family, that our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine could be happy; ſhe endeavoured to be content, but the effort was vain. Mr. Penure ſaw ſhe was far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the ſtation ſhe was in; he pitied her, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

whom he had been accuſtomed to obey, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to offend.</p>
               <p>It happened one afternoon, when his Lady-wife was gone to pay a viſit of ceremony (a thing not very cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary with him) the juſtice took his tea at home. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca was ſummoned to the parlour to make it; but, alas! Rebecca could produce only a tea ſpoonful of black tea, and a very ſmall quantity of ſugar.</p>
               <p>"Why, ſure, child, you are not allowanced in tea and ſugar?" ſaid he, with a look of diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>"There is plenty for me, Sir," ſaid ſhe, affecting a ſmile, and—.</p>

               <p>"Hold, Sir, I beſeech you," cried Rebecca; "you quite terrify me!"</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry for it, child," ſaid he; "but to think my wife ſhould dare treat you thus, <hi>you</hi> who are every way her ſuperior, and who, if I miſtake not, was born to be ſerved by others, not be a ſervant yourſelf!"</p>
               <p>"You are miſtaken, Sir," ſaid our heroine, her eyes falling as ſhe ſpoke: "Indeed you are miſtaken. I am a poor orphan, without friends or connexions, and have only to lament that my education has been ſuperior to my fate.

She ſtrenuouſly oppoſed the liberal donation. He had taken her hand, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it with the money within it, held it while he was ſpeaking, when the door opened, and Mrs. Penure ſtood before them.

               <p>The rage of Mrs. Penure inflamed her features, and ſhot from her eyes; ſhe could not ſpeak, but ſhrieking in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Profligate wretch," ſaid ſhe "vile, ungenerous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain! is it thus my tenderneſs and condeſcenſion, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king you to my bed, is re-paid? Is my money to be ſquandered on your painted Jezabels that you bring into my houſe to diſhonor me? Oh! my unfortunate lot! Muſt I be beggarred by an ungrateful wretch? Yes, I ſee all my property will be waſted, and I ſhall go to the work-houſe." Here her tears broke out, and what with ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and ſcreaming ſhe became unintelligible. Rebecca would not ſtop to vindicate herſelf. She retired to her room in ſilence, and ſoon after received a meſſage from her miſtreſs to leave the houſe, who, at the ſame time, made her ill behaviour a plea for not paying her wages, though ſhe had been in the family above four months. As ſhe was going out at the gate to ſeek the London coach, one of the ſervants put a folded paper in her hand. On opening it ſhe ſaw not the ten guineas, but a ten pound note, with theſe words: <floatingText type="letter">

               <head>CHAP. XXXII. OLD ACQUAINTANCE RENEWED.</head>
               <p>THE coach ſat Rebecca down in Piccadilly; it was quite dark. She thought it was beſt to go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to Mrs. Harris's, and determined to take a coach for that purpoſe. As ſhe ſtood waiting for her trunk to be taken from the boot, two genteel young men paſſed her, one of which turned round, and regarding her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, "it is her, by heavens!" ſaid he, and flew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her.—Rebecca turned ſuddenly round, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the features of Sir George Worthy.</p>
               <p>"My angelic Rebecca!" ſaid he, folding her in his arms, regardleſs of the place where they ſtood, "do I once more behold you? Do I indeed claſp you to my breaſt, or is it an illuſion?"</p>
               <p>"Sir George," ſaid ſhe, ſtruggling to free herſelf from his embrace, "I rejoice to ſee yon well; but I know not what I have done to deſerve this inſult."</p>
               <p>"Who ſhall dare inſult you, my adorable girl? I have found you after ſuch a long ſeparation, when I thought you loſt for ever, and we will never part again."</p>
               <p>"For heaven's ſake let me go Sir George. Why am I thus detained? Are you not married?"</p>
               <p>By this time a crowd had gathered round them. An old ſailor ſeeing a woman in diſtreſs ruſhed forward, and ſtruck Sir George a blow that made him relinquiſh his hold. Rebecca ſprang from him, and forgetful of her trunk, ran haſtily down St. James's-ſtreet. When ſhe had reached the bottom ſhe ſtopped to recover her breath, and then proceeded ſlowly down Pall-Mall.</p>
               <p>A poor miſerable looking object, whoſe emaciated frame was but thinly ſheltered by a tattered mode cloak, for gown ſhe had none, from nocturnal damps, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her feeble ſteps by holding by the iron rails before
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:027651_0172_0FD56553EBE58898"/>
one of the houſes, in a weak, tremulous voice entreated charity.</p>
               <p>Rebecca never turned aſide from the ſupplications of miſery. She ſtopped, and put her hand in her pocket.</p>
               <p>They ſtood immediately under two large lamps.</p>
               <p>"Merciful heaven!" cried the poor mendicant, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her cold hand on the one Rebecca had extended with relief, and gazing ardently at her—"Rebecca! my child! do you not know me?"</p>
               <p>Our heroine looked intently on the pale viſage of the object before her; miſery and ſickneſs had ſomewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it, but ſhe ſaw it was her mother. The feelings of a daughter ruſhed impetuouſly over her heart. She ſunk on her knees upon the pavement, and, claſping her parent in her arms, exclaimed, "Oh, my mother! my dear diſtreſſed mother!" and burſt into an agony of tears.</p>
               <p>When the tumult of their feelings were ſubſided, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca thought of calling a coach, but where were they to drive? She could not think of taking her mother to Mrs. Harris's; they therefore drove to a ſtreet in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, where Mrs. Serl had formerly lodged, and were fortunate enough to meet with an apartment empty. Here their mutual embraces and endearments were again renewed: Rebecca wept for joy at having found a parent whoſe future life ſhe would endeavour to make happy, and Mrs. Serl ſhed tears of contrition for having once treated ſo unworthily ſo good a daughter.</p>
               <p>She informed Rebecca that after they left Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire Serl commenced gameſter, ſharper and ſwindler; that his daughter went on the town, and turned an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned profligate; and that, at laſt overwhelmed with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and diſgrace, Serl himſelf had died in the Fleet-Priſon, leaving her in the greateſt diſtreſs, having neither clothes, money, or friends. Her annuity had been long ſince ſold, and ſhe muſt have periſhed, had ſhe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially met with her daughter.</p>
               <p>When Rebecca viewed her mother's tattered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thought of getting her more comfortable clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, her own trunk recurred to her memory. "I hope
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:027651_0173_0FD5655759DCBE28"/>
it is not loſt," ſaid ſhe; "and it is lucky what little money I poſſeſs is in my pocket."</p>
               <p>Her mother informed her that there was ſome decent apparel at a pawn broker's in the neighbourhood, and Rebecca, having received inſtructions in what manner to proceed, went out in order to get it; but what was her aſtoniſhment, on opening the parcel when ſhe had brought it home, to ſee a gown made of a piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia chints, which ſhe remembered to have had in her trunk when it was ſent into Lincolnſhire, with a muſlin apron, and ſeveral other things, which ſhe equally knew to be her own.</p>
               <p>"Gracious heaven!" ſaid ſhe, dropping the parcel from her hands, and fixing her eyes on her mother.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, my dear?" ſaid Mrs. Serl; "that was a gown given me by poor Serl; it had been bought for his firſt wife."</p>
               <p>"It was mine," ſaid Rebecca, in a firm voice. "If he told you it was his, he told a falſhood; it was in the trunk which I loſt four years ago."</p>
               <p>An explanation now took place, which convinced Mrs. Serl what a villain ſhe had choſen to ſucceed the worthy Mr. Littleton; but our heroine would not ſuffer her to make any painful retroſpects, or to accuſe herſelf. She poured the ſweet balm of affectionate conſolation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boſom of her mother. She forgot her own ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and ſeemed to have no wiſh but to render her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent the like forgetful of every paſt diſagreeable event.</p>
               <p>The next morning ſhe repaired to the houſe where the ſtage had ſtopped in Piccadilly to enquire for her trunk.</p>
               <p>"The old gentleman took it away with him," ſaid one of the waiters, "and paid all expences;" for Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, in her fright the preceding night, had not paid her fare to to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>"What old gentleman?" ſaid ſhe, ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>"Why, the old gentleman who knocked the young man down that was ſo rude to you. He read the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the trunk when it was taken from the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t, ſwore he was your uncle, and inſiſted on having it; as he offered to pay all expences the coachman did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, and both he and the young man went off together
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:027651_0174_0FD5655931409CB0"/>
to ſearch for you; but returned in about an hour, and left word, if you ſhould call this morning, for me to tell you, you might hear of your trunk at number 46, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-Square."</p>
               <p>"That is Lord Oſſiter's," ſaid Rebecca, ſcarcely able to reſpire.</p>
               <p>"And, moreover," ſaid the man, "the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman told me, if I could find where you was gone, or could bring him to a ſight of you, he would give me ten guineas, and ſo, ſeeing as how you are here, we had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter take a coach and go together."</p>
               <p>"No," ſaid Rebecca, ſtruggling to ſuppreſs her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, "No, I cannot go juſt now; in the afternoon it will be more convenient. I will juſt ſtep back to my lodgings, and return to you again by two o'clock."</p>
               <p>The man was ſatisfied. Rebecca tripped out of the houſe, called a coach, and drove home. During her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ride her mind dwelt on the ſingularity of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. She had juſt heard the man, who reſcued her from Sir George's inſults, had gone away with him, had taken her trunk, and directed her to find it at Lord Oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's. It was an inexplicable riddle; he had called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf her uncle, but ſhe knew ſhe had but one uncle and he was abroad in the navy. She was certainly fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in eſcaping a ſnare, which ſhe had no doubt was laid to trepan her. Lord Oſſiter had, perhaps, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to Sir George as an abandoned creature, devoid of virtue or principal; and that gentleman, once ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, ſo reſpected, was now conſidered as one, who, believing her loſt to honour, would join his Lordſhip in any ſtratagem to decoy her into his power.</p>
               <p>Full of theſe ideas, ſhe told her mother ſhe would immediately remove from the apartments ſhe then oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, leſt ſhe ſhould have been watched home, and Sir George might be directed where to find her.</p>
               <p>"Alas! my dear mother," ſaid ſhe, "I am ſenſible of my own weakneſs. I hope I love virtue as well as woman ought; but I know I love Sir George, and though he is the huſband of another; though reaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon, honour, all plead againſt my paſſion, ſtill, ſtill it is ſo engraven on my heart, that to eradicate it, I feel
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:027651_0175_0FD5655A9E64A7A8"/>
is totally impoſſible. Can I then anſwer for my own fortitude? I fear not: I might ſink under powerful temptations; let me then fulfil my duty, and avoid them."</p>
               <p>Her mother approved and ſtrengthened theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and, having but very few things to put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in leſs than two hours they were in a new lodging near Millbank, Weſtminſter. Here Rebecca ſunk under the fatigue of body, and agitation of mind ſhe had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, and a fever enſued, which brought her almoſt to the brink of the grave. The ſtrength of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſoon combated the violence of the diſorder, and ſhe began to recover her ſtrength, when her mother was attacked with one more alarming; this was the ſmall-pox, which, to a perſon of her years, was expected to be fatal.</p>
               <p>Ten pounds was all the worldly wealth Rebecca poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed when ſhe met her mother; but ten pounds in a houſe of ſickneſs would laſt but a very ſhort time; ſhe, therefore on examining the contents of her purſe, when her mother ſickened, found it contained but fifteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and there was a doctor's bill to pay. It was alſo neceſſary his attendance ſhould be continued to Mrs. Serl, whoſe life was in imminent danger. During the firſt ten days of her mother's iilneſs Rebecca hardly left her bedſide, denying herſelf almoſt the neceſſaries of life, in order to lengthen out her little ſtore; but on the fourteenth day ſhe was pronounced out of danger, and that good nurſing, and nouriſhing food; was all that was neceſſary to her reſtoration.</p>
               <p>"Alas!" ſaid Rebecca, "I have no poſſible means of procuring thoſe neceſſary comforts." She was ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſhe ſpoke, to take ſome gruel from the fire, the pin of her handkercheif dropped out, and the picture of Lady Mary ſwung forward againſt her hand.</p>
               <p>Rebecca gazed at it mournfully.—"True," ſaid ſhe, "it is ſet in gold, and might afford a temporary ſupply; but, then, is it not the portrait of my adored benefactreſs? And does it not alſo contain the ſemblance of the only man I ever did or ever can love? But,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:027651_0176_0FD5655C0E8400E0"/>
alas! what right have I to talk of love? Is he not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready married? And were he not, have I not given a ſolemn vow never to liſten to his addreſſes? Fooliſh, fooliſh, Rebecca? why doſt thou nouriſh a paſſion that muſt be forever hopeleſs?"</p>
               <p>She was returning the picture to her boſom, when it ſtruck her ſhe might, perhaps, get the minature carefully taken out, and diſpoſe of the gold in which they were ſet. "If ſo," ſaid ſhe, "I may comfort my mother, and yet preſerve the reſpect due to the portrait of Lady Mary."</p>

               <p>REBECCA was ſo pleaſed with the project of raiſing a ſupply of money from the gold, that ſhe told her mother ſhe would go out for half an hour and breathe the freſh air, as ſhe found the conſinement ſhe had ſuffered rather impeded her returning ſtrength. When ſhe was out ſhe thought, by extending her walk, ſhe ſhould feel herſelf refreſhed, ſhe therefore croſſed the Park, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at Spring Gardens Gate, ſtopped at an eminent goldſmith's in Cockſpur-ſtreet, and requeſted him to take the pictures carefully out, and purchaſe the ſetting. The man had juſt taken it in his hand, and was admiring the neatneſs of the workmanſhip, and the curious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the ſpring, when a chariot ſtopped at the door, and a beautiful young Lady immediately entered. The maſter of the ſhop held the picture open in his hand while he received the Lady's orders concerning a pair of bracelets. The portrait caught her eye: "Bleſs me," ſaid ſhe, "Pray whoſe is that? it is ſo like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I know."—</p>

               <p>"It is a pity to have them unſet," ſaid ſhe. Will you part with it altogether? I will give you twice the value of the gold."</p>
               <p>"I cannot, indeed, part with the portraits, Madam; the one is a much valued friend long ſince dead, and the other—." A pale ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Aye, that other!" ſaid the Lady; "I never ſaw any thing more like than that is to a particular friend of mine; and even the features of the Lady ſeem fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to me."</p>
               <p>"Will you buy the gold, Sir?" ſaid Rebecca.</p>
               <p>"No," cried the Lady, "he ſhall not buy it. If you will not part with it altogether to me for twice its value, (I am certain you will pardon the remark) but one motive could lead you to wiſh to diſpoſe of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting." As ſhe was ſpeaking ſhe had taken ſeveral gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas from her purſe, and wrapped them in paper. "You ſhall call upon me, if you pleaſe, to-morrow morning," continued ſhe, preſenting our heroine with a card, under which ſhe ſlipped into her hand the paper of money, and without waiting for an anſwer, ſhe tripped out of the ſhop.

               <p>Rebecca was truly grateful for the unexpected bounty ſhe had received, and returned home fully reſolved to wait on the benevolent Lady, and return her thoſe thanks her aſtoniſhment had prevented her expreſſing at the time: But on the morrow her mother was ſo very ill it was impoſſible to leave her, and for ſeveral ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days it rained continually: However, at length a fine morning preſented, Mrs. Serl was greatly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Rebecca, dreſſing herſelf as neatly as the very limited ſtate of her wardrobe would allow, proceeded to St. Alban's-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>On knocking at the door ſhe was informed, that Lady Chatterton was gone out for a morning ride; but that, if ſhe was the young woman her Ladyſhip had met at the jeweller's, ſhe was deſired to wait till the Lady returned.</p>
               <p>Rebecca was pleaſed with this little mark of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was ſhewn into a ſmall parlour, where a child, of about eleven years old was practiſing on the piano-forte.</p>

Lady Chatterton has extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward me the hand of benevolence; nor will I repay her by throwing myſelf in the way of her huſband, who, from his behaviour when we met accidentally, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me he ſtill retains an improper regard for me."</p>
               <p>"As my Lady is not at home, my dear Miſs Oſſiter," ſaid ſhe, "I will call again another time."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, let it be ſoon, my own Rebecca; ſay you will come again to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Rebecca tenderly embraced the affectionate child, and having given her a kind of half promiſe to ſee her ſoon again haſtily left the houſe.</p>
               <p>"Every thing," ſaid ſhe, "conſpires againſt me. I never find a friend but ſome croſs accident prevents my reaping any benefit from their kindneſs: misfortunes ſeem to be the only portion allotted for me in this world, and patience and reſignation my only comforters. But I will not complain; I have been unexpectedly relieved when almoſt in deſpair, when every earthly friend had apparently forſaken me; and, I truſt, I ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ted by the ſame beneficient Power, as long as he thinks proper to lay the burthen of life upon me."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:027651_0180_0FD56564579F41A8"/>As ſhe walked along, indulging theſe reflections, it ſtruck her that ſhe would go to her uncle's agent, and enquire when he had heard from him, and whether the old gentleman was ſoon expected in England. But when ſhe got to the place where he uſed to reſide, ſhe found he was removed to a diſtant part of the town; nor could the people, who then occupied the houſe, give her a proper direction to find him.</p>
               <p>"Now every ſtay is gone," ſaid Rebecca, as ſhe purſued her way homeward; "but, I thank God, I feel my health returning, and, I ſhall be enabled to gain, by induſtry at leaſt, the neceſſaries of life for my mother and ſelf." Alas! poor Rebecca, ſhe little knew how ſmall a portion of the world's wealth fell to the ſhare of the humble, the induſtrious female, who by continued labour can ſcarcely gain ſufficient to ſupply, with the coarſeſt food, the wants of nature, or to ſhield with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent clothing her limbs from the inclemency of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>While the daughters of vice and folly are ſurrounded with luxuries, the ſuperfluous part of which would cheer the hearts of the children of miſery; but, Oh! heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflection, the humble, virtuous female, has a ſweet cordial comforter within that diffuſes a pleaſure over her ſoul, which the thoughtleſs votary of folly can never experience.</p>
               <p>Bleſt ſpirit of content that preſides over the innocent breaſt! How enviable are thy tranſports! Thou canſt ſweeten the coarſe ſcanty meal of poverty, and ſhed quiet ſlumbers on the priſoner's eye! The accuteſt pang the heart can feel where thou haſt taken up thine abode, is when it beholds its fallen ſiſters purchaſing the deluſive pleaſures of wealth with the loſs of all that can render them lovely or amiable.</p>
               <p>Rebecca was poor, but her heart was void of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. She enquired for employment, and was ſo happy as to procure ſome; but the fruits of her almoſt inceſſant induſtry were very inadequate to the wants of herſelf and mother, who revived but very ſlowly from the bed of ſickneſs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIV. WE GO BACK TO THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER.</head>
               <p>WHEN Sir George Worthy left England, in order, if poſſible, to baniſh from his remembrance Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca Littleton, he had, previous to his departure, viſited his couſin Eleanor, and informed her of the ſtate of his heart.</p>
               <p>"I eſteem you, Eleanor," ſaid he; "but I do not love you as a man ought to love a woman he takes for his wife. To be candid, my heart is in the poſſeſſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</p>
               <p>"And to be equally candid, dear George," replied the lady, "mine is exactly in the ſame predicament; yet I do not know how we ſhall avoid making each other wretched, for my father poſitively ſwears I ſhall have you or be a beggar, and my poor ſwain has neither name or fortune to recommend him."</p>
               <p>"I mean to be abſent two years," ſaid Sir George, "that will give you a ſhort reprieve. I will write to you often, and if at any time I can be of ſervice to the man of your choice, do not heſitate to command me."</p>
               <p>In the Earl of Chatterton's family was a young man nearly of the ſame age with Eleanor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was a ſoundling, and had been brought up and educated by his lordſhip in the ſtyle of a gentleman, and when at a proper age pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Oakly, which was the name the Earl had given him from having found him one morning at the foot of an oak in his park, wrapped in a mantle, but without any other cloathing. Oakly was a youth of ſtrict honour, and his heart overflowed with gratitude to his benefactor, whom he conſidered in the light of a father; but in ſpite of honour, gratitude, and innumerable reſolutions to the contrary, he loved Lady Eleanor, ſome how or other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally acquainted her with his paſſion, and found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beloved in return.</p>
               <p>Things were in this ſituation when Sir George left En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:027651_0182_0FD56568617EB8E8"/>
and in this ſituation remained when a letter from Eleanor ſummoned him to return, when he had been ſcarcely abſent eighteen months. The Earl was ill, felt himſelf daily declining, and wiſhed to ſee his daughter married before he died. He obeyed the ſummons in haſte.</p>
               <p>Oakly was almoſt diſtracted. "But what am I," ſaid he, "that I ſhould aſpire to the hand of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's daughter, an out caſt, a foundling, without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or name, dependant on his bounty even for the bread I eat? No, I will not impede her union with a man every way her equal, who poſſeſſes honour and goodneſs of heart, and will do juſtice to her virtues. I will leave England," ſaid he.</p>
               <p>Unable to deliberate on a ſubject where inclination and reaſon were ſo much at variance, he flew to the Earl, and ſolicited an exchange into a regiment deſtined to America. "Let me gather laurels in the field of battle, my dear Sir," ſaid he.</p>
               <p>The Earl loved him tenderly. He preſſed to know the cauſe of this unexpected applica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion, and refuſed to exert his intereſt in Oakly's behalf till he was informed.</p>
               <p>"I love a woman of family and fortune," ſaid he, "I have ſome reaſon to think I am not indifferent to her, and, knowing my own unfortunate ſituation, I wiſh to avoid doing a diſhonourable action."</p>
               <p>"You will never act diſhonourable, Oakly," ſaid the Earl, "and this conduct is a proof of it. Who is the Lady?—inform me —I will ſpeak to her freinds in your favour, and give you a genteel fortune."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my generous benefactor," cried Oakly, "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is impoſſible; her parents never will conſent. I dare not name her."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, you are too diffident: I am ſure there is no family, of the leaſt diſcernment, but would think themſelves honoured by the alliance. Come, who is the paragon?"</p>
               <p>"You muſt pardon me, Sir; I ſhould entirely forfeit your friendſhip."</p>
               <p>"You will undoubtedly forfeit it by this unkind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:027651_0183_0FD565698BE99F20"/>
I am willing and able to ſerve you, Oakly; but if, by your obſtinacy, you put it out of my power—."</p>
               <p>"Do not call it obſtinacy. By heavens! Oakly, I love you as my own child; only tell me how to make you happy, and I will do it, though it coſt half I am poſſeſſed of."</p>
               <p>"Ah! my dear Sir, I fear, when you know —."</p>
               <p>"Know what?" cried the Earl, impatiently.</p>
               <p>"That I love Lady Eleanor."</p>
               <p>"Love Eleanor!" cried he, emphatically; then your ſuit is indeed hopeleſs."</p>
               <p>Oakly's heart ſunk within him.</p>
               <p>"You are indeed a noble boy, though," ſaid the Earl, "and from this moment I hold myſelf bound, by the moſt ſacred oath, never to ſuffer you to know the want of a friend. Eleanor has, from her childhood, been deſigned for her couſin George; indeed, my late ſiſter and myſelf entered into a ſolemn engagement, that which ever outlived the other ſhould ſee this union com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted; that now is my taſk. If it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to your peace to leave England, I will procure you the deſired exchange; but I could wiſh, my dear Oakly, you would conquer your paſſion, and remain with us."</p>
               <p>"That is not in my power, Sir;" he replied, "to be employed in actual ſervice is now the only wiſh I have to make."</p>
               <p>The Earl did not mention this converſation to either his daughter or Sir George, and Oakly carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an interview with Eleanor till he was really appointed to a company of foot that was expected to go for New-York in the courſe of a few weeks. He then, having made the neceſſary preparations for joining his regiment, took a tender leave of her, aſſuring her it was his hope to enſure her felicity by baniſhing from her ſight a wretch who had ſtepped between her and her duty, and who would rather die than have it ſaid he had baſely ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len the daughter of the man to whom he owed every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, nay, almoſt life itſelf.</p>
               <p>"'Tis all in vain," ſaid Eleanor, "I can never love
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:027651_0184_0FD5656D5A9363F8"/>
Sir George; nor do I think even the commands of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I love and revere can lead me to give him my hand."</p>
               <p>However, the preparations for the intended nuptials ſtill proceeded. Sir George beheld them with total in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference. He had uſed every endeavour to diſcover Rebecca: he had, by various ſtratagems, traced her to her embarkation with Miſs Abthorpe for America, and was informed the veſſel in which they went was reported to have been loſt, and all on board periſhed.</p>
               <p>"Rebecca loſt!" He remembered his mother's firſt wiſh to ſee Lady Eleanor his wife. "She is an amiable woman," ſaid he, "and though I cannot love again with the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>huſiaſtic ardour I experienced for Rebecca, I will, if ſhe voluntarily accepts my hand, exert myſelf to make her happy. She, like myſelf, has experienced diſappointment in her tendereſt hopes: we can at leaſt conſole each other, and make up in friendſhip what we want in love."</p>
               <p>Oakly had taken leave of his friends at Windſor, and was on his journey for Portſmouth. Sir George was in town with the lawyers, and the Earl and Lady Eleanor at breakfaſt in the library, when a ſervant informed them that a clergyman requeſted to ſpeak with them.—He was deſired to walk up.</p>
               <p>"I am come, my Lord," ſaid he, ſeating himſelf with evident embarraſſment, "from a poor woman in this place, who, it is imagined, is at the point of death. From ſomething ſhe has imparted to me, I imagine it is abſolutely neceſſary for your Lordſhip to pay her a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, as ſhe has a circumſtance to relate which nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your family. She is likewiſe in diſtreſſed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and may, while ſhe lives, which will not be long, require your benevolent aſſiſtance."</p>
               <p>The Earl never wanted to be twice told of an object of compaſſion.—</p>
               <p>"We will go directly," ſaid he, and ringing the bell, ordered the carriage. Lady Eleanor and the clergyman accompanied him.</p>
               <p>At a ſmall cottage, on the extremity of the foreſt, the carriage ſtopped, and the clergyman led the way into an
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:027651_0185_0FD5656F982A9988"/>
inner apartment, where, on a bed, expreſſive of poverty in the extreme, lay a poor emaciated figure, in the laſt ſtage of a conſumption.</p>
               <p>"Here is the Earl and his daughter, Mrs. Watts," ſaid he.</p>
               <p>"They are very good," replied ſhe, "to come and ſee ſuch a wretch as I am. Oh! Sir, Oh! my Lady, you will never forgive me; but I cannot die in peace till I have informed you that, through mine and my ſiſter's wickedneſs, you have nouriſhed an impoſtor in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and that the real heir to the late Sir George Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy's eſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is either totally loſt, or may be a poor wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, deſtitute of bread."</p>
               <p>The Earl and Eleanor ſat in mute aſtoniſhment, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing at each other.—The clergyman exhorted the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to proceed.</p>
               <p>"My eldeſt ſiſter," ſaid ſhe, "was employed by the late Lady Worthy to wet-nurſe her ſon, and was left at Twickenham with the child, while her Ladyſhip made a ſhort tour to Flanders. During her Lady's abſence my ſiſter came to Windſor to me, bringing maſter with her. I at that time gave ſuck to a ſweet little boy exactly of the ſame age, whoſe mother had died at my houſe but a month before. My ſiſter entreated me to take care of maſter Worthy for a day, while ſhe went to town. I conſented, and was proud of my charge. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon (he was aſleep in the cradle) I left a little girl to rock him, and ſtepped about half a mile to purchaſe ſomething for ſupper againſt my ſiſter came home. I made what haſte I could, but on my return, what was my terror, to ſee the cradle empty, and my girl at play in the ſtreet? However, I did not make any noiſe, or alarm the neighbourhood; but enquiring of the girl who had been there, ſhe ſaid only two gypſey women beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. It immediately occurred to me, that the gold bells and coral, together with the coſtly lace cap and jam the child had on, had been the incitement to this theft. When my ſiſter returned ſhe was almoſt diſtracted—her character would be gone—ſhe ſhould never dare face her Lady again! That evening we could think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:027651_0186_0FD565712342E6B8"/>
in order to deprecate the ſtorm we ſhould expect on my Lady's return, till the diabolical thought preſented itſelf of ſubſtituting my little nurſling, whoſe features and complexion were nearly the ſame, in the room of maſter Worthy, quieting our conſciences with the idea, that, as his mother was dead, and his father poor, and talked of going abroad, it would be doing a deed of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that, if we ſhould ever find the loſt infant, we might then acknowledge the fraud. Accordingly my ſiſter returned to Twickenham with the child, the plan ſucceeded beyond our expectations, for we feared the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of the ſervants, and I wrote to the father of the boy that his child was dead."</p>
               <p>"And who is it then," cried the enraged Earl, "whom you have thus infamouſly palmed upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily for the ſon of my ſiſter, and who was within a few days to have been married to my daughter?"</p>
               <p>"His father's name was George Littleton," ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, faintly, "and he was chriſtened after him."</p>
               <p>"And have you never heard any thing of my poor couſin?" ſaid Eleanor, tenderly.</p>
               <p>"Never, Madam; but ſhould he ever be found, he has on his right arm, juſt below the ſhoulder, the mark of a mulberry."</p>
               <p>"Saddle my horſes—ſend off all my ſervants," ſaid the Earl, ſtarting up; "he ſhall not go to that d—d fighting place."</p>
               <p>"My dear father!" cried Eleanor.</p>
               <p>"Rejoice, rejoice, my girl, for upon my ſoul the young dog had that mark on his arm when I found him ſprawling under the oak."</p>
               <p>"And is he alive, then?" ſaid the poor woman. "Thank God—then I ſhall die content."</p>
               <p>Eleanor felt intereſted in the ſate of the poor creature, who had made this important diſcovery. She promiſed to befriend her while ſhe lived, and to take care of her daughter, a girl about fifteen years old. She then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home with her father, who immediately diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a meſſenger to bring his new-found nephew to town again.—While Eleanor retired to her apartment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:027651_0187_0FD5657291CA65C8"/>
on the alteration a few hours had made, and how much it had brightened her future proſpects.</p>
               <p>George Littleton, as we muſt now call him, however conſcious of his innocence, felt greatly hurt at being ſo long the uſurper of another's name and property; but the Earl would not ſuffer him to dwell on that ſubject, and on his marriage with Lady Eleanor. Sir George preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his quandom rival with the writings of an eſtate, worth five hundred pounds a year, given to him and his heirs for ever; and ſo fond were they of his ſociety, that it was but a ſmall part of every year he ſpent from them.</p>
               <p>The Earl did not long ſurvive his daughter's marriage, and Sir George ſucceeded to the title of Earl of Chatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the Earl having begged the reverſion of it for him ſome time previous to his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Littleton had given up all hopes of ever again hearing of Rebecca.—He imagined her dead, but her image was ſo deeply engraven on his heart, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to enter into the married ſtate. Sometimes he would think ſhe might, perhaps, have been his ſiſter, for he had never heard her father's Chriſtian name, but his heart recoiled from this ſuggeſtion. She was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a relation, yet he had never heard Rebecca mention an uncle, but ſhe might have many; he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made many enquiries concerning her family.</p>
               <p>One evening, when he was at a ſupper-party with Lord Oſſiter, that nobleman addreſſed him with, "George, I ſaw an old acquaintance of your's laſt night. Ah, now I think of it, ſhe may be a relation."</p>
               <p>"Who do you mean my Lord?"</p>
               <p>"Who! why who but that demure, primitive piece of affected innocence, Mrs. Rebecca Littleton."</p>
               <p>"You muſt be miſtaken, my Lord: I have every reaſon to think ſhe has been dead ſome years."</p>
               <p>"And I have ſubſtantial reaſons to think ſhe was alive laſt night, and in my arms."</p>
               <p>He then gave an account of the affair at Lord Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's, little to the honour of hour heroine. He alſo aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſhe voluntarily accompanied him in a chaiſe to a neighbouring town, where ſhe ſpent the night at an inn,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:027651_0188_0FD56575760F4B60"/>
but left it in the morning with a perſon whom he imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe liked better.</p>
               <p>"Poor girl," ſaid George, mentally, "heavy muſt have been the trials that drove her to a life of infamy."</p>
               <p>From that time he frequented every place where he ſuppoſed it likely to meet with her. "I will ſnatch her from perdition," ſaid he. "She ſhall ſhare my little portion, eat of my bread, and drink of my cup. I will ſpeak conſolation to a mind that was once as pure as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and cannot without infinite pain, be intimate with vice."</p>
               <p>About this time Lord Oſſiter's extravagance had ſo envolved his eſtates, that it was neceſſary he ſhould make a trip to the Continent in order to retrieve them. George undertook to ſettle all his debts, and put the eſtates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proper regulations, and to this purpoſe took up his reſidence in Bedford-Square. He had been dining out, where the champaigne flew briſkly round, when he acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally met our heroine juſt deſcended from the ſtage. The wine gave him a great flow of ſpirits, which, added to the relation he had heard from Lord Oſſiter, accounts for the rude manner in which he accoſted her.</p>
               <p>The blow he received from the old ſailor almoſt ſtunn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: However, he followed him into the houſe, and inſiſted on ſatisfaction for the inſult, as he termed it. The old man ſwore it was a blow given in a right cauſe, and that he was ready to give him a dozen more if he was not already ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>During this altereation the coachman came in with Rebecca's trunk, and aſked where the young woman was to pay him his fare?</p>
               <p>"She is ran off," ſaid a man who ſaw the tranſaction.</p>
               <p>"Well then," ſays the coachman, "I muſt keep the trunk for what ſhe owes." As he ſpoke he reſted one end of it on a chair near a table, on which ſtood a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
               <p>The old ſailor looked at the directions, rubbed his eyes, and looked again. "By all that's good," ſaid he, "it is my own girl, my Rebecca?—Which way did ſhe go? Let me follow her. Stand out of my way."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="unknown:027651_0189_0FD524308A5C3CA8"/>"Not till you have paid me," ſaid the coachman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſurlily.</p>
               <p>The old man threw down five ſhillings, and deſiring a waiter to take care of the trunk, ran out, followed by George; but, inſtead of turning into Pall-Mall, they went through the Palace into the Park, their ſearch was therefore vain.</p>
               <p>As they returned ſlowly together, George aſked the old man "if he was any relation to Miſs Littleton?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſaid he, "I am all the relation ſhe has in the world, and a deviliſh poor one too, for I have not above half a guinea at this preſent time in my pocket. I have not been in London above two hours, nor in England above eight and forty."</p>
               <p>"Is your name Littleton, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"So my mother told me: I ſuppoſe ſhe knew."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me if I am troubleſome; but had you ever a ſon?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but he died an infant."</p>
               <p>"You were informed he died at Windſor?"</p>
               <p>The old man anſwered in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>"Ah! my dear Sir," ſaid George, "you were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived—your ſon ſtill lives—longs eagerly to embrace you—and divide with you the competence he enjoys."</p>
               <p>By this time they had returned to the public-houſe. George called for a room, knelt before his father, and related to him all the reader is already acquainted with. What wonder if, in the delightful hurry of ſpirits this diſcover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> occaſioned, they did not think of the neceſſity of writing a note for Rebecca, in caſe ſhe came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for her trunk; but, ſatisfied with leaving a verbal meſſage, they repaired to Bedford-ſquare, to enjoy the pleaſures of an uninterrupted converſation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXV. DISAPPOINTMENT.</head>
               <p>THE next morning Rebecca, ſo dear to both their hearts, recurred to their imaginations; George beheld her in want, plunged in infamy, the horrors of which her ſuſceptible heart ſeverely felt, and from which ſhe could by no means extricate herſelf.</p>
               <p>"She may be in want," ſaid his father; "but I'll be d—d if ſhe is infamous. I know the dear girl, George, and I'd ſtake my life upon her innocence. He then gave his ſon an account of the manner in which he found her in America, of the reſpect and eſteem ſhe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wherever ſhe was known, and how much ſhe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by Colonel Abthorpe's family. But let us go to the houſe where the coach ſtopped," continued he; "ſhe will moſt likely call there to get her trunk."</p>
               <p>They went out together, and entered the houſe juſt ten minutes after Rebecca had left it. Diſappointed and grieved, unable by any means to trace which way ſhe had gone, and fearing ſhe would be diſtreſſed by the loſs of her trunk, which might contain all her wordly poſſeſſions, they returned heavily home, and reſolved to advertiſe it. This they immediately did in ſeveral papers, in ſuch a manner as it was impoſſible for Rebecca not to know it was herſelf that was meant, though only the initials of the name were uſed; but Rebecca never ſaw the papers, and the repeated advertiſements were fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>George had introduced his father to Lord and Lady Chatterton; but, though Rebecca had been once or twice mentioned before that Lady, he had always avoided en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into explanations, and Lady Chatterton did not know that ſhe was the woman George had ſo long lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for though, in the earlier part of their intimacy, he had frequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:027651_0191_0FD5657B5B782678"/>On the day Lady Chatterton had met Rebecca at the jeweller's, ſhe mentioned the circumſtance at dinner time. George and his father that day dined with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Good heavens!" ſaid George, "I am certain it could only be Rebecca herſelf."</p>
               <p>"I wiſh it may," ſaid the Lady;—"but I did not think of it at the time I ſaw her: however, I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed her to come here to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"How did the poor girl look?" ſaid old Mr. Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
               <p>"Very pale," replied the Lady, "and, I fear, is much diſtreſſed by the agitation ſhe diſcove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Oh! my poor loſt Rebecca," ſaid George, and, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing haſtily from table, left the room, to give vent to thoſe emotions he could no longer ſuppreſs.</p>
               <p>Rebecca, in diſtreſs, offering, with evident reluctance the gold that enveloped his portrait to ſale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> convinced him he ſtill retained a tender place in her remembrance; once to have been beloved by Rebecca would have been his higheſt wiſh—now ſhe was contaminated—loſt to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue! And, though ſtill inexpreſſibly dear to his heart, ſhe could never be his wife; yet ſhe might be innocent. Lord Oſſiter was not a man of the ſtricteſt veracity. He would have given worlds for an interview with her, and unable to wait the iſſue of the morning, when ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in St. Alban's-ſtreet, he obtained from Lady Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton a direction to the jeweller, and haſtened to Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur-ſtreet, in hopes to be able through him to trace out her place of abode; but the jeweller had never ſeen her before, and had hardly thought of her ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. He could give him no information.</p>
               <p>Thoſe only who have felt the pangs of ſuſpence can imagine the anxiety of Mr. Littleton and George during the night. The next morning they repaired early to St.

Alban's-ſtreet, but the day paſſed and no Rebecca ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Another and another morning came, and ſtill brought with them diſappointment.</p>
               <p>"She will never come,"—ſaid George.—"The poor girl is conſcious of her unhappy ſituation, and ſhame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents her taking advantage of Lady Chatterton's offers of ſervice. Mr. Littleton began to be of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but the benevolent Lady Chatterton never went out without leaving orders with her porter, that, ſhould Rebecca call, ſhe might be deſired to wait till her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. "I will myſelf," ſaid ſhe, "have the pleaſure of preſenting her to her uncle. She ſhall not be haſtily informed that he is in England, leſt it ſhould overpower her ſpirits, and if I find her worthy, I will give her to her amiable couſin, and make her a fortune worth his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance."</p>
               <p>But unfortunately Miſs Oſſiter's joy, the effuſions of which was mingled with incoherent intelligence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her uncle's, marriage, prevented poor Rebecca from reaping any benefit from her Ladyſhip's kind intentions in her behalf.</p>
               <p>George Littleton had accompanied Lord and Lady Chatterton in their morning ride. They returned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Miſs Oſſiter came running to them as they entered the parlour.</p>
               <p>"Oh! dear aunt, who do you think has been here— the greateſt ſtranger! I do not think you know her; but I told her I was ſure you would be glad to ſee her."</p>
               <p>"Why, who was it, my love?" ſaid her Ladyſhip, ſeating herſelf.</p>
               <p>"Why, it was my own Rebecca Littleton; I knew her in a minute, though ſhe is ſo pale and thin."</p>
               <p>"And where is ſhe?" ſaid George, almoſt choaked with riſing emotions!</p>
               <p>"She could not wait any longer," replied the child; "but ſaid ſhe would call again to-morrow"</p>
               <p>"Was ever any thing ſo unfortunate!" ſaid Lady Chatterton.</p>
               <p>George bit his lips, took haſty ſtrides backward and

forward in the room, frequently ſtruck his forehead with his hand, but ſaid not a word.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon the following letter was brought to Lady Chatterton: <floatingText type="letter">

                        <p>"Agreeable to your Ladyſhip's benevolent deſire, I this morning waited on you in St. Alban's-ſtreet, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which the extreme illneſs of my mother had preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my enjoying ſo early as I could have wiſhed. While I was, in compliance with your commands, waiting your Ladyſhip's return from airing, I diſcovered that Lord Chatterton and Sir George Worthy are one and the ſame perſon; it therefore ſtruck me that your Ladyſhip, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen his portrait in my poſſeſſion, might entertain but an indifferent opinion of my character: It might alſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion uneaſineſs between my Lord and you, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt that felicity which I fervently wiſh may be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and laſting as your lives. I thought it my duty, therefore, to explain to your Ladyſhip the means by which this portrait came into my poſſeſſion.</p>
                        <p>"I once, Madam, lived in the family of the late La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Mary Worthy, more as an highly favoured compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than a ſervant. Indeed ſhe was to me a generous friend, a dear and reſpected benefactreſs, whom living I loved with the affection of a daughter, and whom dead I can never ceaſe to lament.</p>
                        <p>"Some months after her death, I received her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait as a preſent from Sir George, by the hands of Mrs. Harley, her Ladyſhip's houſe-keeper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but did not know it contained the reſemblance of Sir George himſelf till ſome time after it had been in my poſſeſſion; nor have I ſeen him ſince, till about two months ago, when I accidentally met him in the ſtreet, and even then we ſcarcely ſpoke to each other.</p>
                        <p>"Permit me, Madam, to return my thanks for the unexpected bounty you ſo delicately beſtowed upon me; to thank you alſo for that benevolence of heart which led you ſo far to intereſt yourſelf in my behalf, as to wiſh again to ſee me; to have enjoyed your friendly protection would have been a cordial to my depreſſed ſoul; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

it, the ſtudy of my life: but, alas, Madam, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable obſtacle is placed between me and ſo envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a diſtinction. Since I was ſo happy as to meet you, a circumſtance has occurred, which will prevent my again having the pleaſure of waiting on you: But permit me to offer up the moſt ardent prayers for the continued hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of yourſelf and Lord. May peace and love ever dwell in your boſoms, and proſperity crown your days. Permit me alſo to add, that however inconſiſtent my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct may appear, my heart will everflow with the moſt grateful affection towards your Ladyſhip, while it beats in the breaſt of,</p>

               <p>"I can't comprehend all this," ſaid Lady Chatterton, giving the letter into George Littleton's hand. He ran his eye haſtily over the contents.</p>
               <p>"But I can," ſaid he: "I conceive it all; the dear girl has never heard of the diſcovery of the real Sir George Worthy. She imagines me to be your huſband, and the generoſity of her ſoul will not ſuffer her to throw herſelf in the way of a man who once profeſſed to love her, and whom, from the whole tenor of her conduct, I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think ſhe loves."</p>
               <p>"I would lay my life ſhe is a good girl," ſaid Lady Chatterton; "indeed her countenance appeared the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex of a mind replete with innocence and purity. I will inſtantly order the carriage, and go to her; nor will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without her."</p>
               <p>"Dear, generous Lady Chatterton," ſaid George, ringing the bell.</p>
               <p>"Where is the perſon who brought this letter?" ſaid the Lady.</p>
               <p>"It was brought by a porter, Madam, and he did not ſtop a moment."</p>

                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:027651_0195_0FD56580D1B53FB8"/>The joy that had for a moment animated the features of George inſtantly vaniſhed. He again caught up the letter, but there was no addreſs annexed to it.</p>
               <p>Juſt then his father entered, and they lamented toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that now they were more than ever convinced of the worth of Rebecca ſhe had effectually ſecluded herſelf from them.</p>
               <p>"Overwhelmed with poverty too," ſaid George, and attendant on a ſick mother, who may, perhaps, be periſhing for want, not only of medical aſſiſtance, but of the comforts and neceſſaries on which exiſtence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends."</p>
               <p>"We will uſe every endeavour though to diſcover her retreat," ſaid Lady Chatterton, wiping away the tears that ſtole from her expreſſive eyes, "and when we have found her we will chaſe ſorrow from her heart, and unite our endeavours to make her forget ſhe had ever been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy."</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVI. LADY CHATTERTON'S BIRTH-DAY.</head>
               <p>AFTER every probable method had been taken by Mr. Littleton, George and Lady Chatterton, to diſcover our heroine's retreat, all proving equally inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, they were obliged to reſt ſatisfied that no exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs had been wanting; and truſt to chance for a diſcovery, which their united efforts had been unable to make. Old Mr. Littleton began to be tired of living on ſhore, and applied for employment; but as he annexed to the requeſt the condition of being promoted in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he found but little attention was paid to it, and he only received repeated promiſes, that when opportunity offered he ſhould be remembered. He ſpent great part of his time with the Chatterton family, and as the ſummer approached it was propoſed, that both himſelf and George ſhould accompany them to their country ſeat.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:027651_0196_0FD565865BAA4298"/>Lady Chatterton's birth-day was on the 7th of June, and ſhe made a point of always celebrating it before ſhe left town, her huſband regularly preſenting her with two hundred pounds to be expended on the occaſion. Mr. Clayton, his Lordſhip's chaplain, being caterer extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, always provided the entertainment, in which her Ladyſhip was ſo very ſelfiſh, as to allow no one to partake but her huſband, this identical chaplain, and herſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clayton was always extremely buſy for ſome weeks previous to the day, the whole cities of London, Weſtminſter, and their environs, being ranſacked for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies to ſuit her Ladyſhip's taſte; for on this day ſhe was a real voluptuary, though all the reſt of her life was marked by temperance and moderation: But to ſpeak without a metaphor, Lady Chatterton was a woman of ſo unfaſhionable a turn, that, rather than raiſe the envy of half the town, by giving a ſplendid ball, ſhe choſe to expend the money her huſband gave her in relieving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence, and raiſing depreſſed merit.</p>
               <p>"There ſhall be ſome cauſe for rejoicing on my birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day," ſaid ſhe, "for I will cheer the afflicted ſpirit, and fulfil the duties incumbent on my ſtation; we were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to be of ſervice to each other, and we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to rejoice in our creation but as we fulfil the deſign of him who gave us being."</p>
               <p>Mr. Clayton, therefore, carefully ſearched for objects proper to excite her Ladyſhip's compaſſion, and ſhare her benevolence. The happy ſeaſon now drew near, and Clayton took his uſal walks round the metropolis, while, with a laudable curioſity, he made little errands into chandlers-ſhops, green-ſtalls, and public houſes, in order to learn the circumſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ances of the people in every poor neighbourhood through which he paſſed. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, as he was purchaſing ſome barly-ſugar at a ſhop of the former deſcription, he ſaw two ſuſpicious looking men aſcend the ſtairs, and immediately, after heard a buſtle in the appartment over the ſhop. Preſently the men came down, accompanied by a genteel looking man in deep mourning. He had the air and manner of
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:027651_0197_0FD5658793251F80"/>
a gentleman; but his uncombed hair, and pale, unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven face, beſpoke a mind ill at eaſe.</p>
               <p>"Well, they have nabb'd him at laſt," ſaid the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the ſhop, as the young man and his ungenteel companions left the houſe together.—</p>
               <p>"Would you beleive it, Sir, that young man, not ſix months ago, was one of the gayeſt bucks about town. I remember him flaſhing away like a Lord, and I was told he viſited Lords and gentlefolks of great fortune. Indeed, they did ſay, there was a Lady of quality in love with him, but that was not much to his credit or advantage, for ſhe was a married woman, and once he had liked to have got himſelf killed by her huſband."</p>
               <p>"But if he was ſo gay," ſaid Clayton, "how came he ſo reduced as he now appears?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Sir, you muſt know I can give you good information, for I once lived ſervant in the family, though now, thank God, I can hold up my head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſervice, or without being beholding to any body, and that is more than every one can ſay."</p>
               <p>"Well, but about the young gentleman," ſaid Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, rather impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Yes, as I was ſaying, he was a gay ſpark, and Miſs, his ſiſter, a very fine Lady. His father was a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and kept a large houſe in the city, and lived away at a very high rate; coach, ſervants, every thing like a Lord: Well, behold you, he died about ſix months ago, and left not a farthing behind him, ſo away w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt coach, fine houſe, furniture, plate and all, to pay his debts, and Madam, Miſs, and her brother, forced to humble themſelves, ſo they came to lodge with me. The young man got a trifling place in ſome office, and that is all they have to live on, which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in my conſcience, is little enough, for they run one long bills with me.</p>
               <p>Why, Sir, they owes me above three guineas now; but, ſeeing as how other people are taken meaſures to get their own, I ſhall make bold to aſk for mine. Charity begins at home, is an old proverb, and a very good one; don't you think ſo, Sir? If ſo be Mr. Savage can't pay
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:027651_0198_0FD565895C6F2CC0"/>
his taylor, mayhap, when the bill gets a little higher, he might not be able to pay me?</p>
               <p>"True," ſaid Clayton, coldly; "but could you bring me to a ſight of Mrs. Savage, or her daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Lord! not I; they are ſo proud, that if a body of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to ſpeak or introduce a friend, they are upon ſtilts directly."</p>
               <p>"Well, but pray ſtep up with a civil meſſage from me; ſay I wiſh to ſpeak with them on particular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
               <p>"And who muſt I tell them you are, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"My name is of no conſequence; only ſay a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man."</p>
               <p>The woman executed the commiſſion, and, ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, deſired Mr. Clayton to walk up.</p>
               <p>On entering a ſmall ill-furniſhed apartment, he beheld two charmingly prepoſſeſſing women, the eldeſt of whom did not appear to be more than forty years old, and the youngeſt ſeventeen; they were dreſſed in mourning, plain but extremely becoming, and had much the air of women of faſhion.</p>
               <p>He apologized for the ſeeming rudeneſs of a ſtranger intruding himſelf into their apartments uninvited, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that he had ſeen the tranſaction of the arreſt, and thought it might be in his power to alleviate, if not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely remove, their diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>The mother's eyes overflowed at the mention of her ſon's impriſonment. Her daughter took her hand, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to her lips, gave her a conſolatory look; but the ſtarting drops of ſympathy that trembled in her eyes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade her utterance.</p>
               <p>"Lady Chatterton will dry thoſe tears," ſaid Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, mentally, "or I am deceived in he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> character.— What a pity ſo much ſweetneſs ſhould droop under the heavy hand of affliction!"</p>
               <p>Clayton was a young man—Miſs Savage a charming woman.</p>
               <p>He drew from them, in the moſt delicate manner, an account of their various embarraſſments in pecuniary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſaid he had known the late Mr. Savage, and once
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:027651_0199_0FD5662632F76CA0"/>
received a great obligation at his hands, which he was happy in having now the power to return, requeſted they would conſider him as their banker; "for, my dear Miſs," ſaid he to the daughter, "I owed your father a conſiderable ſum of money." He then preſented them with the whole contents of his purſe, as he ſaid, in part of payment, and departed, promiſing to ſee them again in a few days.</p>
               <p>His aſſertions, in regard to having known Mr. Savage, were not ſtrictly true; but it was a pious fraud, by which he prevailed on the diſtreſſed ladies to accept pecuniary aſſiſtance, and, he humbly truſted, the deſign would ſanctify the act.</p>
               <p>Two days from this was Lady Chatterton's birth-day.</p>
               <p>"Come, Clayton," ſaid ſhe, when ſhe had read the memorandums over of that day's intended <hi>rout<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Clayton introduced her to the Ladies as a perſon court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their friendſhip, and deſirous of ſerving them. From them ſhe learned that young Savage, when arreſted, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the leaſt hope of liberation, had inſiſted on being immediately conveyed to priſon.</p>
               <p>"Then we will go and find a key to open thoſe tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous doors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" ſaid Lady Chatterton, "and I think," glancing her eyes over her memorandums, "I have ſome other buſineſs to tranſact there. My dear Ladies, I will ſoon ſend this beloved ſon and brother to you, on condition you all dine with me to-day at five o'clock." She preſented her card and departed, leaving the ladies oppreſſed with delightful ſenſations that could only be expreſſed by tears.</p>
               <p>Lady Chatterton proceeded to the priſon, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to young Savage, whom ſhe immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated on his liberty, "your diſagreeable buſineſs is all ſettled, Sir, ſaid ſhe, "and I beg you will haſten home to your expecting mother and ſiſter."

to conſider her as an inhabitant of this nether globe, or a a celeſtial ſpirit.</p>
               <p>"If what you ſay, Madam," cried he, "be really true, and I have no reaſon to doubt it, for your counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is benevolence itſelf. Pardon my ſeeming ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but I could have wiſhed the affair had not been ſo ſpeedily concluded."</p>
               <p>"Strange, indeed!" ſaid her ladyſhip: Do you not wiſh for liberty?"</p>
               <p>"Moſt ardently, Madam; but there is in this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of miſery an object more deſerving your charitable notice, an object ſo pitiable, ſo very intereſting to the feelings of humanity, that I could, with ſatisfaction have ſeen the liberality extended in my behalf transferred to her."</p>
               <p>"Thank heaven!" ſaid her Ladyſhip, "neither the means of comforting the afflicted, nor the will to uſe thoſe means, are denied me; neither my heart or purſe are limitted. Come, Sir, lead on to the place where I may dry the tear of ſorrow, and gladden the priſoner's ear by the welcome ſound of liberty."</p>
               <p>Savage led the way to a miſerable room, where, on a truſs of ſtraw, for neither bed nor chair appeared in the apartment, laid an old woman, almoſt worn to a ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, whoſe haggard looks and laboured breathing, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to portend approaching diſſolution!—On the ſame ſtraw, ſupporting the aged invalid's head in her lap, ſat the almoſt ſhadowy figure of a young creature, habited in a white bead gown, her hair hanging negligently over her face and ſhoulders, one hand held the burning forehead of the apparently dying woman, the other hung motionleſs by her ſide. Beſide them ſtood a pitcher of water, and a ſmall brown loaf.</p>
               <p>"Heaven preſerve us," ſaid lady Chatterton <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Lady Chatterton drew near, took her hand, and, in a voice ſoft as the muſic of the ſpheres, bid her be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:027651_0201_0FD5658A985EE058"/>
"Come, cheer up, my poor girl," ſaid ſhe, "I will do all I can to ſerve you."</p>
               <p>She turned her head, looked earneſtly at Lady Chart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton, a faint glow ruſhed over her pale features, and as quickly diſappeared as ſhe exclaimed:—"Oh! I know you; you are an angel of benevolence," and fainted.</p>
               <p>She was immediately carried into the air, and on cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the lace of her ſtays, Lady Chatterton diſcovered a ſmall ſhagreen caſe, hung pendant from her neck by a riband. A ſudden irreſiſtable impulſe led her to open it, when the portraits of George Littleton and Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtruck her ſight. She looked again on the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was now juſt recovering, and inſtantly in her reanimated countenance, recognized the features of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca.</p>
               <p>The debt, for which her mother had been thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, was fifteen pounds, which was contracted with the apothecary during her's and Rebecca's illneſs. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Chatterton ſoon contrived to have it diſcharged, and poor Mrs. Serl being tenderly informed of her liberation, was carefully placed in the carriage, her daughter on one ſide, and her deliverer on the other, who ſupported her as the coach moved ſlowly toward St. Alban's-Street; nor ever did conqueror, in his triumphal car, feel more exulting ſenſations than did her Ladyſhip when ſhe led the grateful, trembling Rebecca into her own houſe, ſaw her mother laid in a comfortable bed, and heard from a phyſician, that tender attention and peace of mind, would be more efficacious towards her reſtoration than medicine. He alſo ordered Rebecca to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately put to bed, and take ſome wine and water, with a few drops of laudanum in it, as the agitation of her ſpirits, and ſudden change of fortune, had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wildneſs in her looks, and an incoherence in her diſcourſe, that rather alarmed him. Lady Chatterton ſaw the preſcription adminiſtered, and then deſcended to meet her gueſts in the dining parlour, while the exhauſted Rebecca ſunk into a more peaceful ſlumber than ſhe had enjoyed for many months.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXVII. AS IT SHOULD BE.</head>
               <p>THE party aſſembled in the dining parlour were Lord and Lady Chatterton, the Savages, Mr. Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, George Littleton and his father.</p>
               <p>It was a tender, difficult taſk to inform theſe affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate relations that Rebecca was found, yet it was a taſk her Ladyſhip's generous heart burned to execute. Gently and by degrees ſhe made the intereſting diſcovery; but when George knew that his Rebecca was really in the houſe, it was impoſſible to prev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

George ſoftly drew aſide the curtain. She was in a profound ſleep. He ſtood gazing with a look of joy, mingled with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pity, on her altered countenance. Mr. Littleton ſunk on a chair by the bedſide. "Oh! my poor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering girl," ſaid he, "how thou art changed!" His head fell on the pillow beſide her, and tears ruſhed down his venerable countenance.</p>
               <p>Rebecca moved, the nurſe forced George from her bed-ſide. She opened her eyes; the power of recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemed for a while ſuſpended. She looked wildly round her.</p>
               <p>"Where is my mother?" ſaid ſhe: "I will not be taken from her. If ſhe muſt die in priſon, I will die with her." She raiſed herſelf in bed, and ſaw her uncle.</p>
               <p>"Rebecca!" ſaid he, in an accent of tenderneſs, "have you forgot me, my dear Rebecca."</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, my beloved uncle," ſaid ſhe, her head dropping on his ſhoulder. "Oh! no. How long have you been in England?" Then pauſing a moment: "But what have they done with my mother?"</p>
               <p>"She is ſafe, my love; endeavour to recollect your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: do you not know ſhe came with you to this houſe? She is in bed in the next room."</p>
               <p>Rebecca put her hand to her forehead: "I am ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:027651_0203_0FD565904CE6CF88"/>
to think," ſaid ſhe; "but I cannot remember where I am, how I came here."—By degrees the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of recollection returned, and every circumſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to her memory:—"I am in the houſe of Lord Chatterton," ſaid ſhe. "I could have preferred any other."</p>
               <p>"But ſuppoſe, my dear girl, Lord Chatterton ſhould not be the perſon you think him? Suppoſe he ſhould be a man whom you have never ſeen?"</p>
               <p>Rebecca liſtened in ſilence, and her uncle, in the moſt cautious manner, informed her of his having found a ſon, and that ſon was the man ſhe had imagined marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Lady Eleanor Harcourt.</p>
               <p>The relation was wonderful. Rebecca could ſcarcely credit it, yet, if it was really true, if ſhe was ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by the man whoſe image was engraven on her heart, and, indeed, releaſed from the vow ſhe had ſo ſolemnly given her deceaſed benefactreſs, the rapidity with which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe reflections ruſhed through her brain, the violent emotions of her heart, almoſt overpowered her weak frame. She breathed with difficulty, her eyes grew dim, the attendant perceived the change, and, giving her a few drops in ſome water, recalled her fleeting ſpirits.</p>
               <p>"And where is this now couſin of mine?" ſaid ſhe, with a faint ſmile, when ſhe was a little recovered: "methinks I ſhould like to ſee him."</p>
               <p>George's heart palpitated violently. He drew near the bed, dropped on one knee, and cried, "Oh! my Rebecca, behold me here!"</p>
               <p>A ſmile of ineffable pleaſure beamed over the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Rebecca while ſhe extended her hand toward her lover. He took it, and preſſed it to his lips. The enſuing ſcene can be eaſily imagined by the feeling heart, and to thoſe devoid of ſenſibility, the deſcription would be inſipid, we therefore paſs it over in ſilence.</p>
               <p>Peace being now reſtored to the boſom of Rebecca, her health, her vivacity and bloom, rapidly returned, her mother too, recovered a ſufficient degree of health, to enable her to participate in her daughter's happineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="unknown:027651_0204_0FD56592C80E39B0"/>An early day was named for the union of George and Rebecca, previous to which Lord Chatterton procured the old lieutenant to be ſupera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Pardon me, my Lord," ſaid he, "but that young gentleman has no means of ſupporting his amiable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter. For my own part, though in the early part of life accuſtomed to all the indulgencies of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent fortune, I have been long convinced, that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of riches cannot ſecure happineſs.

               <p>Lady Chatterton had, with her Lord's approbation, ordered a ſettlement to be made on Rebecca of two thouſand pounds, which ſum his Lordſhip ſupplied and placed in the funds for her own particular uſe.</p>
               <p>The day after the union took place, Rebecca, George, Mr. Littleton, and Mrs. Serl, took an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate leave of their generous friends in St. Alba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

She was ſoon viſited by the neighbouring gentry, among whom, what was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er ſurpriſe to ſee, Lady Winterton, whoſe ſable habilments told ſhe was emancipated from that worſt of ſlavery, wedlock, with the man ſhe could not love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="unknown:027651_0205_0FD565938D802958"/>She informed our heroine that her health was ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by vexation, and the effects of the wound ſhe had received, that her life was thought in imminent danger. Change of air was preſcribed, and her Lord had brought her down to a ſmall eſtate of his in Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; that ſhe had found benefit from the change, but from the time of their leaving town, her Lord's health had declined; he had been ſubject to an aſthmatic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, which increaſed upon him, and had terminated his life about two months before Rebecca's arrival in the country.</p>
               <p>Lady Winterton was too delicate in her preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to mention the name of Savage. She had been imprudent, but never guilty. Sickneſs had mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the extreme vivacity of her diſpoſition, and taught her to reflect. She could not avoid wiſhing to hear of him, or learn the reaſon why, from the fatal evening when they met at Chiſwick, he had never attempted to write to or ſee her. She was entirely ignorant of his fate from that time, yet ſhe kept thoſe wiſhes carefully concealed.</p>
               <p>Rebecca applauded her conduct, and deſired her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to mention, when next he wrote to Savage, that Lady Winterton was their neighbour, and that ſhe was a widow. The effect this letter produced may be eaſily imagined. Savage flew into Berkſhire on the wings of love, and the fair widow promiſed, in due time, to give him her hand.</p>
               <p>Lord and Lady Oſſiter continued on the Continent, where, immerſed in vice and diſſipation, his Lordſhip fell a victim to intemperance, and her Ladyſhip became notorious for her gallantry; forgetful of the ſacred name of mother, ſhe gave the reins to folly, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly defied the laws of virtue and honour.</p>
               <p>Though Rebecca, from the variegated ſcenes through which ſhe had paſſed, had purchaſed a thorough know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world, yet had it not hardened her heart, or rendered her callous to the calls of miſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

deſtitute orphan. When the poor ſaw her they bleſſed her—infant lips ſet forth her praiſes—and aged knees bent for her before the Throne of Grace. She cheered the declining years of her mother and uncle. They called down bleſſings on her head.</p>
               <p>Her huſband adored her. Her ſervants loved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced her. Her boſom was the ſeat of unfeigned pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. The ſmile of content dimpled on her cheek, and her dwelling was the manſion of peace.</p>
