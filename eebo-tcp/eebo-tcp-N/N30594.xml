            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT being my Lot to be pretty much with him in the Time of his Illneſs, which he bore with Patience, to Admiration; his Diſtemper being a <hi>Stoppage in his Stomach or Breath,</hi> he was ſometimes almoſt ſtrangled; yet, when he could ſpeak, his Words, though few, were ſavory: Many Times Praying to the Lord with a compoſed Mind, when in great Extremity of Body. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:040609_0002_101652FDC9DB50C0"/>
thought it great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for People to endeavour to dwell near the Lord, when we ſee how he beareth up ſuch as ſincerely truſt in him: As we have Cauſe to believe this Youth did. For he would call upon the Lord with a chearful Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and with ſuch Hope and Confidence, as if he no Ways queſtioned the Lord's Mercy to him; and would often drop ſweet Doctrine among ſuch as came to ſee him, for their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; often Praying to the Lord, not only for himſelf, but for the Family, and his Friends and Neighbours. O the many ſweet Prayers that I have heard him put up unto the Lord, that he <hi>

Adding: <hi>O thou pure Fountain! that never can be drawn dry, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en my Soul a little, and ſtrengthen my inward Man</hi>; with many more precious Sayings: Often ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>O Lord! raiſe up many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, from the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>from the</hi> Weſt, <hi>from the</hi> North, <hi>and from the</hi> South; <hi>that they may be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters unto thee, that ſo thy Bleſſed Truth may grow and proſper in the Earth.</hi> Thus was the Concern of this virtuous Young Man, in the Time of his Illneſs, as it had been in his Health. He was a diligent Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter of Friends Meetings, when well; and ſometimes he had a Concern upon him to bear a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teſtimony for the Truth; which I believe he was faithful to, and retained his Integrity to the End. O that the Youth of our Age
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040609_0004_10165301D9DD6DF0"/>
would take him (and ſuch as he was) for an Example. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment ſuited his Clothes, plain; and his Words were ſeaſoned with Grace.</p>
            <p>And he would often ſay: <hi>O that our young People would but give up their Days to ſerve the Lord! How would he adorn them!</hi> Often directing them to that <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Guide,</hi> meaning the <hi>Spirit of Truth.</hi> He himſelf was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adorned with that inward Adorning of a <hi>meek and a quiet Spirit, which is with the Lord of great Price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I write theſe few Lines, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eaſe my own Mind concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing One for the Loſs of whom my Spirit mourns in ſecret: Having often been comforted with what dropt from his Mouth; the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which attended his Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040609_0005_10165303C6157308"/>
to my needy Soul as the Oil of the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> to the wounded Man. But the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is able to make up the Loſs, and raiſe up many more faithful Miniſters, as was the fervent Prayer of this Young Man.</p>
            <p>I never perceived that the Thoughts of Death were any Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to him: But ſometimes, when he thought he was near his End, he would be very earneſt with the Lord, that <hi>he would give him Patience to bear his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Body, that he might not diſhonour his Holy Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not remember that I ever heard him ſpeak a murmuring Word, though his Diſtemper was hard to bear for a long Time; only I have heard him ſay, <hi>O Lord! What have I done? What have I done, that thou art pleaſed thus to try me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:040609_0006_1016530763D6B2A8"/>I have admired to ſee the Goodneſs of the Lord to him, and how he fed his Soul with Food convenient and ſuitable to the Day: For he would ſing Praiſes to the Lord, when he could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak, his Pain of Body was ſo great: Which hath made my Soul to rejoice, altho', at the ſame Time, my Heart hath been pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within me, to ſee the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Body. But after a long Time, and many Means uſed, he ſeemed ſomewhat to recover, which gave us great Hopes the Lord would have ſpared him with us longer; he being a Pattern of Piety, Meekneſs, and Plainneſs; and ſeemed as if he might have been of great Service among our young People. But his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeizing him ſharply again, put
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040609_0007_1016530BE994BEB0"/>
a Period to his natural Life in a little Time, and ſet his Soul at Liberty from the diſtreſſed Body. And I am well ſatisfied the Lord hath taken him to Himſelf, to live with Him forever.</p>
            <p>I was not with him in his laſt Moments: But a Perſon who was with him at that Time ſignified to me: "That the Night before he departed, he was in a ſweet Frame of Spirit; and a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes before he left the World, he was heard to ſay, <hi>How glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is thy powerful Preſence, O Lord!</hi> And the laſt that he was heard to ſpeak, was, <hi>Into thy Hands, O Lord, do I commit my Soul!</hi>"</p>
            <p>Having been much with him, and ſeeing his Zeal, Courage and Conſtancy, I could do no leſs than make theſe Remarks thereof to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040609_0008_1016530E694E9D90"/>
his Memory. And conclude with Deſires that we who have enjoyed ſo many of the Lord's Mercies, may prize them as we ought to do.</p>

            <p>Written by One who hath been made a Sharer of the good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which the Lord enabled him to drop among his Relations and Friends, for their Edification and Inſtruction; Part of which I took to myſelf, and treaſured it up in my Mind.</p>
