            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I HAVE nothing in ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from his Majeſty to lay before you at this Time; I have general Inſtructions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you, at all Times, ſuch Meaſures as may tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote that Peace and Order upon which your own Happineſs and Proſperity as well as his Majeſty's Service very much depend.

               </gap>bed and diſordered State is a Truth too evident to be denied. The Cauſe of this Diſorder appears to me equally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. I wiſh I may be able to make it appear ſo to you, for then I may not doubt that you will
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012856_0003_0F8B9520F9A3C0A8"/>
agree with me in the proper Meaſures for the Removal of it. I have pleaſed myſelf, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Years paſt, with Hopes that the Cauſe would ceaſe of itſelf and the Effect with it, but I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, and I may not any longer, conſiſtent with my Duty to the King and my Regard to the Intereſt of the Province, delay communicating my Sentiments to you upon a Matter of ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. I ſhall be explicit and treat the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject without Reſerve. I hope you will receive what I have to ſay upon it with Candor, and, if you ſhall not agree in Sentiments with me, I promiſe you, with Candor likewiſe, to receive and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what you may offer in Anſwer.</p>
            <p>When our Predeceſſors firſt took Poſſeſſion of this Plantation or Colony, under a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it was their Senſe, and it was the Senſe of the Kingdom, that they were to remain ſubject to the ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament. This appears from the Charter itſelf and from other irreſiſtable Evidence. This ſupreme Authority has, from Time to Time, been exerciſed by Parliament and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to by the Colony, and hath been, in the moſt expreſs Terms, acknowledged by the Legiſlature and, except about the Time of the Anarchy and Confuſion in England which preceeded the Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of King Charles the Second, I have not diſcovered that it has been called in Queſtion even by private or particular Perſons until within ſeven or eight Years laſt paſt. Our Provincial or Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws have, in numerous Inſtances, had Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Acts of Parliament made to reſpect the Plantations in general and this Colony in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012856_0004_0F8B9521FB0C3600"/>
and in our Executive Courts both Juries and Judges have; to all Intents and Purpoſes, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſuch Acts as Part of our Rule of Law. Such a Conſtitution, in a Plantation, is not peculiar to England but agrees with the Principles of the moſt celebrated Writers upon the Law of Nations that when a Nation takes Poſſeſſion of a diſtant Country and ſettles there, that Country, though ſeparated from the principal Eſtabliſhment or Mother Country, naturally becomes a Part of the State equally with its ancient Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>So much however of the Spirit of Liberty breathes thro' all Parts of the Engliſh Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that although from the Nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there muſt be one ſupreme Authority over the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet this Conſtitution will admit of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Powers with legiſlative and executive Authority, greater or leſs according to local and other Circumſtances. Thus we ſee a Variety of Corporations formed within the Kingdom with Powers to make and execute ſuch Bylaws as are for their immediate Uſe and Benefit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſuch Corporations ſtill remaining ſubject to the general Laws of the Kingdom. We ſee alſo Governments eſtabliſhed in the Plantations which, from their ſeparate and remote Situation, require more general and extenſive Powers of Legiſlation within themſelves than thoſe formed within the Kingdom, but ſubject nevertheleſs, to all ſuch Laws of the Kingdom as immediately reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them or are deſigned to extend to them, and accordingly we in this Province have, from the firſt Settlement of it, been left to the Exerciſe of our legiſlative and executive Powers, Parliament
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012856_0005_0F8B9526373F0548"/>
occaſionally though rarely, interpoſing as in its Wiſdom has been judged neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Under this Conſtitution, for more than One Hundred Years, the Laws both of the ſupreme and ſubordinate Authority were in general, duly executed, Offenders againſt them have been brought to condign Puniſhment, Peace and Order have been maintained and the People of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince have experienced as largely the Advantages of Government, as, perhaps, any People upon the Globe, and they have from Time to Time in the moſt public Manner expreſſed their Senſe of it and, once in every Year, have offered up their united Thankſgivings to God for the Enjoyment of theſe Privileges and, as often, their united Prayers for the Continuance of them.</p>
            <p>At Length the Conſtitution has been called in Queſtion and the Authority of the Parliament of Great-Britain to make and eſtabliſh Laws for the Inhabitants of this Province has been, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, denied. What was, at firſt, whiſpered with Caution, was ſoon after openly aſſerted in Print and, of late, a Number of Inhabitants in ſeveral of the principal Towns in the Province, have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together in their reſpective Towns and, having aſſumed the Name of legal Town Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, have paſſed Reſolves which they have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be placed upon their Town Records, and cauſed to be printed &amp; publiſhed in Pamphlets and News-Papers. I am ſorry that it is thus become impoſſible to conceal what I could wiſh had never been made public. I will not particularize theſe Reſolves or Votes and ſhall only obſerve to you,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012856_0006_0F8B9526F7901F00"/>
in general, that ſome of them deny the ſupreme Authority of Parliament, and ſo are repugnant to the Principles of the Conſtitution, and that others ſpeak of this ſupreme Authority, of which the King is a conſtituent Part and to every Act of which his Aſſent is neceſſary, in ſuch Terms as have a direct Tendency to alienate the Affections of the People from their Sovereign who has ever been moſt tender of their Rights, and whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Crown and Dignity we are under every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Obligation to defend and ſupport. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe Reſolves, Committees of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence are formed, in ſeveral of thoſe Towns, to maintain the Principles upon which they are founded.</p>
            <p>I know of no Arguments, founded in Reaſon, which will be ſufficient to ſupport theſe Principles or to juſtify the Meaſures taken in Conſequence of them. It has been urged, that the ſole Power of making Laws is granted by Charter to a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature eſtabliſhed in the Province, conſiſting of the King by his Repreſentative the Governor, the Council and the Houſe of Repreſentatives—that by this Charter there are likewiſe granted or aſſured to the Inhabitants of the Province all the Liberties and Immunities of free and natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to all Intents Conſtructions and Purpoſes whatſoever, as if they had been born within the Realm of England—that it is Part of the Liberties of Engliſh Subjects, which has its Foundation in Nature, to be governed by Laws made by their Conſent in Perſon or by their Repreſentative—that the Subjects in this Province are not and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Repreſented in the Parliament of Great-Britain
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012856_0007_0F8B95293699F760"/>
and, conſequently, the Acts of Parliament cannot be binding upon them.</p>
            <p>I do not find, Gentlemen, in the Charter ſuch an Expreſſion as <hi>ſole</hi> Power or any Words which import it. The General Court has, by Charter, <hi>full</hi> Power to make ſuch Laws as are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws of England. A favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction has been put upon this Clauſe when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> has been allowed to intend ſuch Laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land only as are expreſly declared to reſpect us. Surely then this is by Charter a Reſerve of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority to Parliament to bind us by ſuch Laws, at leaſt, as are made expreſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to us and conſequently, is a Limitation of the Power given to the General Court. Nor can it be contended that by the Liberties of free and natural Subjects is to be underſtood an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from Acts of Parliament becauſe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented there, ſeeing it is provided, by the ſame Charter, that ſuch Acts ſhall be in Force; and if they that make the Objection to ſuch Acts will read the Charter with Attention, they muſt be convinced that this Grant of Liberties and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities is nothing more than a Declaration and Aſſurance on the Part of the Crown that the Place to which their Predeceſſors were about to remove was and would be conſidered as Part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the Crown of England, and therefore that the Subjects of the Crown ſo removing, and thoſe born there or in their Paſſage thither or in their Paſſage from thence, would not become Aliens but would throughout all Parts of the Engliſh Dominions, wherever they might happen to be, as well as within the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012856_0008_0F8B9529A65DB760"/>
Colony, retain the Liberties and Immunities of free and natural Subjects, their Removal from or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> being born within the Realm notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If the Plantations be Part of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Crown, this Clauſe in the Charter does not confer or reſerve any Liberties but what would have been enjoyed without it and what the Inhabitants of every other Colony do enjoy where they are without a Charter. If the Plantations are not the Dominions of the Crown will not all that are born here be conſidered as born out of the Ligeance of the King of England, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they go into any Part of the Dominions will they not be deemed Aliens to all Intents and Purpoſes, this Grant in the Charter notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding?</p>
            <p>They who claim Exemption from Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by Virtue of their Rights as Engliſhmen, ſhould conſider that it is impoſſible the Rights of Engliſh Subjects ſhould be the ſame, in every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in all Parts of the Dominions. It is one of their Rights as Engliſh Subjects to be governed by Laws made by Perſons in whoſe Election they have, from Time to Time, a Voice—They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the Kingdom where, perhaps, they were in the full Exerciſe of this Right to the Plantations where it cannot be exerciſed or where the Exerciſe of it would be of no Benefit to them. Does it follow that the Government, by their Removal from one Part of the Dominions to another, loſes it's Authority over that Part to which they remove, and that they are freed from the Subjection they were under before; or do they expect that Government ſhould relinquiſh
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012856_0009_0F8B952A03F43CD0"/>
its Authority becauſe they cannot enjoy this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Right? Will it not rather be ſaid that, by this their voluntary Removal, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed for a Time at leaſt, one of the Rights of an Engliſh Subject which they might if they pleaſed have continued to enjoy and may again enjoy whenſoever they will return to the Place where it can be exerciſed?</p>
            <p>They who claim Exemption, as Part of their Rights by Nature, ſhould conſider that every Reſtraint which Men are laid under by a State of Government is a Privation of Part of their natural Rights, and of all the different Forms of Government which exiſt, there can be no two of them in which the Departure from Natural Rights is exactly the ſame. Even in Caſe of Repreſentation by Election, do they not give up Part of their natural Rights when they conſent to be repreſented by ſuch Perſon as ſhall be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the Majority of the Electors, although their own Voices may be for ſome other Perſon? And is it not contrary to their natural Rights to be obliged to ſubmit to a Repreſentative for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years, or even one Year, after they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with his Conduct, although they gave their Voices for him when he was elected? This muſt therefore be conſidered as an Objection againſt a State of Government rather than againſt any particular Form.</p>
            <p>If what I have ſaid ſhall not be ſufficient to ſatisfy ſuch as object to the Supreme Authority of Parliament over the Plantations, there may ſomething further be added to induce them to an
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012856_0010_0F8B952AB6A82060"/>
Acknowledgment of it which I think will well deſerve their Conſideration. I know of no Line that can be drawn between the ſupreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament and the total Independence of the Colonies: It is impoſſible there ſhould be two independent Legiſlatures in one and the ſame State, for although there may be but one Head, the King, yet the two Legiſlative Bodies will make two Governments as diſtinct as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of England and Scotland before the Union.

               </gap>in, could we have any Claim to the Protection of that Government of which we are no longer a Part? Without this Protection ſhould we not become the Prey of one or the other Powers of Europe, ſuch as ſhould firſt ſeize upon us? Is there any Thing which we have more Reaſon to dread than Independence? I hope it will never be our Misfortune to know by Experience the Difference between the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of an Engliſh Coloniſt and thoſe of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, French or Dutch.</p>
            <p>If then the Supremacy of Parliament over the whole Britiſh Dominions ſhall no longer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, it will follow that the <hi>meer</hi> Exerciſe of its Authority can be no Matter of Grievance. If it has been or ſhall be exerciſed in ſuch Way and Manner as ſhall appear to be grievous, ſtill this cannot be ſufficient Grounds for immediately denying or renouncing the Authority or refuſing to ſubmit to it. The Acts and Doings of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the moſt perfect Form of Government will not always be thought juſt and equitable by all the Parts of which it conſiſts, but it is the greateſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012856_0011_0F8B952BC4DD4128"/>
Abſurdity to admit the ſeveral Parts to be at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to obey or diſobey according as the Acts of ſuch Authority may be approved or diſapproved of by them, for this neceſſarily works a Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government. The Manner then of obtaining Redreſs muſt be by Repreſentations and Endeavours, in ſuch Ways and Forms as the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed Rules of the Conſtitution preſcribe or allow in order to make any Matters alledged to be Grievances appear to be really ſuch; but I conceive it is rather the <hi>meer</hi> Exerciſe of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is complained of as a Grievance, than any heavy Burdens which have been bro't upon the People by Means of it.</p>
            <p>As Contentment and Order were the happy Effects of a Conſtitution ſtrengthened by univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Aſſent and Approbation, ſo Diſcontent and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order are now the deplorable Effects of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution enfeebled by Conteſt and Oppoſition. Beſides Diviſions and Animoſitics which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the Peace of Towns and Families, the Law in ſome important Caſes cannot have its Courſe,—Offenders ordered by Advice of His Majeſty's Council to be proſecuted, eſcape with Impunity and are ſupported and encouraged to go on of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,—the Authority of Government is bro't into Contempt, and there are but ſmall Remains of that Subordination which was once very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in this Colony, and which is eſſential to a well-regulated State.</p>
            <p>When the Bands of Government are thus weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, it certainly behoves thoſe with whom the Powers of Government are intruſted to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which may tend to ſtrengthen them.</p>

I have diſcloſed my Sentiments to you without Reſerve. Let me intreat you to conſider them calmly and not to be too ſudden in your Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. If my Principles of Government are right let us adhere to them. With the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples our Anceſtors were eaſy and happy for a long Courſe of Years together, and I know of no Reaſon to doubt of your being equally eaſy &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. The People, influenced by you will forſake their unconſtitutional Principles and deſiſt from their Irregularities which are the Conſequence of them, they will be convinced that every Thing which is valuable to them depend upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with their Parent State, that this Connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion cannot be continued in any other Way than ſuch as will alſo continue their Dependance upon the ſupreme Authority of the Britiſh Dominions, and that, notwithſtanding this Dependance, they will enjoy as great a Proportion of thoſe Rights to which they have a Claim by Nature or as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen as can be enjoyed by a Plantation or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony.</p>
            <p>If I am wrong in my Principles of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or in the Inferences which I have drawn from them, I wiſh to be convinced of my Error. Independence I may not allow myſelf to think that you can poſſibly have in Contemplation. If you can conceive of any other conſtitutional De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance than what I have mentioned, if you are of Opinion that upon any other Principles our Connexion with the State from which we ſprang can be continued, communicate your Sentiments to me with the ſame Freedom and Unreſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as I have communicated mine to you.</p>

I have no Deſire, Gentlemen, by any Thing I have ſaid to preclude you from ſeeking Relief, in a conſtitutional Way, in any Caſes in which you have heretofore or may hereafter ſuppoſe that you are aggrieved and, although I ſhould not concur with you in Sentiment, I will, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, do nothing to leſſen the Weight which your Repreſentations may deſerve. I have laid before you what I think are the Principles of your Conſtitution: If you do not agree with me I wiſh to know your Objections: They may be convincing to me, or I may be able to ſatisfy you of the Inſufficiency of them: In either Caſe I hope, we ſhall put an End to thoſe Irregularities, which ever will be the Portion of a Government where the Supreme Authority is controverted, and introduce that Tranquility which ſeems to have taken Place in moſt of the Colonies upon the Continent.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Buſineſs of the Seſſion I will not now particularly point out to you.

            <head>ON the 25th of January William Brattle, Harriſon Gray, James Pitts, James Humphrey, and Benjamin Greenleaf, Eſquires, a Committee of his Majeſty's Council, waited on the Governor with an Anſwer to the foregoing SPEECH, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe your Excellency,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Board have conſidered your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's Speech to both Houſes with the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention due to the Subject of it; and we hope with the Candour you are pleaſed to recommend to them.</p>
            <p>We thank you for the Promiſe, that "if we ſhall not agree with you in Sentiments, you will with Candour likewiſe, receive and conſider what we may offer in Anſwer."</p>
            <p>Your Speech informs the two Houſes that this Government is at preſent in a diſturbed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered State; that the Cauſe of this Diſorder is the unconſtitutional Principles adopted by the People in queſtioning the Supreme Authority of Parliament; and that the proper Meaſure for removing the Diſorder muſt be the ſubſtituting contrary Principles.</p>
            <p>Our Opinion on theſe Heads, as well as on ſome others proper to be noticed, will be obvious in the Courſe of the following Obſervations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:012856_0015_0F8B95325F2674F0"/>
With regard to the preſent diſordered State of the Government, it can have no Reference to Tumults or Riots: from which this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as free as any other whatever. If your Excellency meant only that the Province is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and in a State of Uneaſineſs, we ſhould intirely agree with you; but you will permit us to ſay we are not ſo well agreed in the Cauſe of it. The Uneaſineſs, which was a general one through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Colonies, began when you inform us the Authority of Parliament was firſt called in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <abbr>viz.</abbr> about ſeven or eight Years ago. Your mentioning that particular Time might have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to your Excellency the true Cauſe of the Origin and Continuance of that Uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>At that Time the Stamp-Act, then lately made, began to operate: Which with ſome pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceeding and ſucceeding Acts of Parliament, ſubjecting the Colonies to Taxes without their Conſent, was the original Cauſe of all the Uneaſineſs that has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince; and has occaſioned alſo an Enquiry into the Nature and Extent of the Authority by which they were made. The late Town-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in ſeveral Towns are Inſtances of both. Theſe are mentioned by your Excellency in Proof of a diſordered State: But tho' we do not approve ſome of their Reſolves, we think they had a clear Right to inſtruct their Repreſentatives on any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they apprehended to be of ſufficient Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to require it: which neceſſarily implies a previous Conſideration of, and Expreſſion of their Minds on, that Subject: however miſtaken they may be concerning it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:012856_0016_0F8B95332E67C6A8"/>
When a Community, great or ſmall, think their Rights and Privileges infringed, they will expreſs their Uneaſineſs in a Variety of Ways: ſome of which may be highly improper, and criminal. So far as any of an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>trocious Nature have taken Place, we would expreſs our Abhorrence of them: and as we have always done hitherto, we ſhall continue to do, every Thing in our Power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and ſuppreſs them. But it is in vain to hope that this can be done effectually ſo long as the Cauſe of the Uneaſineſs, which occaſioned them, exiſts.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency will perceive that the Cauſe you aſſign is by us ſuppoſed to be an Effect deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the original Cauſe abovementioned: the Removal of which will remove its Effects.</p>
            <p>To obtain this Removal, we agree with you in the Method pointed out in your Speech, where you ſay, "the Manner of obtaining Redreſs muſt be by Repreſentations and Endeavours in ſuch Ways and Forms as the Conſtitution allows, in order to make any Matters alledged to be Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances appear to be really ſuch." This Method has been purſued repeatedly. Petitions to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament have gone from the Colonies, and from this Colony in particular; but without Succeſs. Some of them, in a former Miniſtry, were previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſhewn to the Miniſter, who (as we have been informed) adviſed the Agents to poſtpone preſenting them to the Houſe of Commons 'till the firſt reading of the Bill they refer'd to: when being preſented, a Rule of the Houſe againſt receiving Petitions on Money Bills was urged for
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012856_0017_0F8B9533C0705DA0"/>
the rejecting of them, and they were rejected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: And other Petitions for want of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, or whatever was the Reaſon, have had the ſame Fate. This we mention, not by Way of Cenſure on that honourable Houſe, but in ſome Meaſure to account for the Conduct of thoſe Perſons, who deſpairing of Redreſs in a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Way, have denied the juſt Authority of Parliament: concerning which we ſhall now give our own Sentiments, intermixt with Obſervations on thoſe of your Excellency.</p>
            <p>You are pleaſed to obſerve, that "when our Predeceſſors firſt took Poſſeſſion of this Colony, under a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it was their Senſe, and it was the Senſe of the Kingdom, that they were to remain Subject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament." And to prove that Subjection the greater Part of your Speech is employed.</p>
            <p>In order to a right Conception of this Matter, it is neceſſary to guard againſt any improper Idea of the term <hi>Supreme</hi> Authority. In your Idea of it your Excellency ſeems to include <hi>unlimited</hi> Authority: for you are pleaſed to ſay, you "know of no Line that can be drawn between the Supreme Authority of Parliament and the total Independence of the Colonies:" But if no ſuch Line can be drawn a Denial of that Authority in any Inſtance whatever implies and amounts to a Declaration of total Independence. But if Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority includes unlimited Authority, the Subjects of it are emphatically Slaves: and equally ſo whether reſiding in the Colonies or
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012856_0018_0F8B953485CD13B0"/>
Great-Britain. And indeed in this Reſpect all the Nations on Earth, among whom Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exiſts in any of its Forms, would be alike conditioned: excepting ſo far as the mere Grace and Favor of their Governors might make a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; "for from the Nature of Government there muſt be, as your Excellency has obſerved, one Supreme Authority over the whole."</p>
            <p>We cannot think, "that when our Predeceſſors firſt took Poſſeſſion of this Colony it was their Senſe, or the Senſe of the Kingdom, that they were to remain Subject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament" if this Idea of it. Nor can we find that this appears from the Charter; or that ſuch Authority has ever been exerciſed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſubmitted to by the Colony, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Legiſlature.</p>
            <p>Supreme or unlimited Authority can with Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs belong only to the Sovereign of the Univerſe: And that Fitneſs is derived from the Perfection of his Nature.—To ſuch Authority, directed by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom &amp; infinite Goodneſs, is due both active and paſſive Obedience: Which, as it conſtitutes the Happineſs of rational Creatures, ſhould with Chearfulneſs and from Choice be unlimitedly paid by them.—But with Truth this can be ſaid of no other Authority whatever. If then from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and End of Government, the ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of every Government is limited, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority of Parliament muſt be limited; and the Enquiry will be what are the Limits of that Authority with Regard to this Colony?—To fix them with Preciſion, to determine the exact
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012856_0019_0F8B95359A3BED58"/>
Lines of Right and Wrong in this Caſe, as in ſome others, is difficult; and we have not the Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to attempt it. But we humbly hope, that as we are perſonally and relatively, in our private and public Capacities, for ourſelves, for the whole Province, and for all Poſterity, ſo deeply inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in this important Subject, it will not be deemed Arrogance to give ſome general Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon it, eſpecially as your Excellency's Speech has made it abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>For this Purpoſe we ſhall recur to thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords that contain the main Principles on which the Engliſh Conſtitution is founded; and from them make ſuch Extracts as are pertinent to the Subject.</p>
            <p>Magna Charta declares, "that no Aid ſhall be impoſed in the Kingdom, unleſs by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council of the Kingdom, except to redeem the King's Perſon, &amp;c". And that "all Cities, Boroughs, Towns and Ports ſhall have their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and free Cuſtoms; and ſhall have the Common Council of the Kingdom concerning the Aſſeſsment of their Aids, except in the Caſes aforeſaid."</p>
            <p>The Statute of the 34th of Edward I, de tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagio non concedendo, declares, "that no T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or Aid ſhould be laid or levied by the King or his Heirs in the Realm, without the Good Will and Aſſent of the Arch Biſhops, Biſhops, Earls Barons, Knights, Burgeſſes, and other the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Commonalty of this Realm."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:012856_0020_0F8B9536118EDB98"/>
A Statute of the 25 Ed. 3, enacts "that from thenceforth no Perſon ſhall be compelled to make any Loans, to the King againſt his Will, becauſe ſuch Loans were againſt Reaſon and the Franchiſe of the Land."</p>
            <p>The Petition of Rights in the 3d of Charles 1ſt, in which are cited the two foregoing Statutes, declares that by thoſe "Statutes, and other good Laws and Statutes of the Realm, his Majeſty's Subjects inherited this Freedom, that they ſhould not be compelled to contribute to any Tax, Tallage, Aid, or other like Charge, not ſett by common Conſent of Parliament." And the Statute of the I. of William 3d, for declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and ſetling the Succeſſion of the Crown declares, "That the levying of Money for or to the Uſe of the Crown, by Pretence of Prerogative without Grant of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for longer Time, or in any other Manner than the ſame is or ſhall be granted, is illegal."</p>
            <p>From theſe Authorities it appears an eſſential Part of the Engliſh Conſtitution, that no Tallage or Aid or Tax ſhall be laid or levied "without the Good Will and Aſſent of the Freemen of the Commonalty of the Realm." If this could be done without their Aſſent, their Property would be in the higheſt Degree precarious: or rather they could not with Fitneſs be ſaid to have any Property at all. At beſt they would be only the Holders of it for the Uſe of the Crown; and the Crown be in Fact the real Proprietor. This would be Vaſſallage in the extreme; from which the generous Nature of Engliſhmen has been ſo
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012856_0021_0F8B953A1DB168F0"/>
abhorrent, that they have bled with Freedom in the Defence of this Part of their Conſtitution, which has preſerved them from it: and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the ſame Generoſity, they can never view with Diſapprobation any lawful Meaſures taken by us for the Defence of our Conſtitution, which intitles us to the ſame Rights and Privileges with themſelves.</p>
            <p>Theſe were derived to us from Common Law, which is the Inheritance of all his Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; have been recognized by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and confirmed by the Province Charter, which eſtabliſhed its Conſtitution; and which Charter has been recognized by Act of Parliament alſo. This Act was made in the ſecond Year of his late Majeſty GEO. II, for the better Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majeſty's Woods in America: in which is recited the Clauſe of the ſaid Charter reſerving for the Uſe of the Royal Navy all Trees ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Maſts: and on this Charter is grounded the ſucceeding enacting Clauſe of the Act. And thus is the Charter implicitly confirmed by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>From all which it appears, that the Inhabitants of this Colony are clearly intitled to All the Rights and Privileges of free and natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: which certainly muſt include that moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential one, that no Aid or Taxes be levied on them without their own Conſent, ſignified by their Repreſentatives. But from the Clauſe in the Charter relative to the Power granted to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court to make Laws, not repugnant to the Laws of England, your Excellency draws this
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012856_0022_0F8B953AE26F71E8"/>
Inference, that "ſurely this is by Charter a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of Power and Authority to Parliament to bind us by ſuch Laws, at leaſt, as are made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly to refer to us, and conſequently is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the Power given to the General Court."—If it be allowed that by that, Clauſe there was a Reſerve of Power to Parliament to bind the Province, it was only by ſuch Laws as were in Being at the Time the Charter was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for by the Charter there is nothing appears to make it refer to any Parliamentary Laws, that ſhould be afterwards made, and therefore it will not ſupport your Excellency's Inference.</p>
            <p>The Grant of Power to the General Court to make Laws runs thus,—"full Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, from Time to Time, to make, ordain and eſtabliſh all Manner of wholeſome and reaſonable Orders, Laws, Statutes and Ordinances, Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Inſtructions, either with Penalties or without (ſo as the fame be not repugnant or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of this our Realm of England) as they ſhall judge to be for the Good and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our ſaid Province." &amp;c.—We humbly think an Inference very different from your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's, and a very juſt one too, may be drawn from this Clauſe, if Attention be given to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Orders and Laws that were to be made.—They were to be wholeſome, reaſonable and for the Good and Welfare of the Province, and in order that they might be ſo, it is provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they be "not repugnant or contrary to the Laws of the Realm," that were then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: by which Proviſo, all the Liberties and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of free and natural Subjects within the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012856_0023_0F8B953B388D91D0"/>
Realm were more effectually ſecured to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Province agreeable to another Clauſe in the Charter, whereby thoſe Liberties and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities are expreſsly granted to them: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Power of the General Court is ſo far limited, that they ſhall not make Orders and Laws to take away or diminiſh thoſe Liberties and Immunities.</p>
            <p>This Conſtruction appears to us a juſt one, and perhaps may appear ſo to your Excellency if you will pleaſe to conſider, that by another Part of the Charter effectual Care was taken for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the General Aſſembly paſſing of Orders and Laws repugnant to, or that in any Way might mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate with Acts of Parliament then or ſince made; or that might-be exceptionable in any other Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect whatever: for the Charter reſerves to his Majeſty the Appointment of the Governor, whoſe Aſſent is neceſſary in the paſſing of all Orders and Laws: after which they are to be ſent to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for the Royal Approbation or Diſallowance: by which double Controul effectual Care is taken to prevent the Eſtabliſhment of any improper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Laws whatever.—Beſides, your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is ſenſible that "Letters Patent muſt be conſtrued one Part with another, and all the Parts of them together, ſo as to make the whole har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize and agree. But your Excellency's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Paragraph impowering the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Court to make Orders and Laws, does by no means harmonize and agree with the Paragraph granting Liberties and Immunities; and therefore we humbly conceive is not to be admitted: Whereas on the other Conſtruction there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012856_0024_0F8B953C42434110"/>
Harmony and Agreement between them. But ſuppoſing your Excellency's Inference juſt, that by the ſaid former Paragraph (conſidered by itſelf) are reſerved to Parliament Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to bind us by Laws made expreſsly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to us. Does it conſiſt with Juſtice and Equity that it ſhould be conſidered apart, and urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the People of this Province with all its Force and without Limitation, and at the ſame Time the other Paragraph which they thought ſecured to them the eſſential Rights and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of free and natural Subjects be rendered of no Validity? If the former Paragraph (in this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed caſe) be binding on this People, the latter muſt be binding on the Crown, which thereby became Guarantee of thoſe Rights and Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Or it muſt be ſuppoſed that one Party is held by a Compact, and the other not: Which Suppoſition is againſt Reaſon and againſt Law; and therefore deſtroys the Foundation of the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. However, ſuppoſing it well founded, it would not from thence follow, that the Charter intended ſuch Laws as ſhould ſubject the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Province to Taxes without their Conſent: For (as appears above) it grants to them all the Rights and Liberties of free and natural Subjects: Of which one of the moſt eſſential is a Freedom from all Taxes not conſented to by themſelves.—Nor could the Parties, either Grantor or Grantees, intend ſuch Laws. The Royal Grantor could not, becauſe his Grant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts ſuch Intention; and becauſe it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with every Idea of Royalty and royal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to grant what it does not intend to grant. And it will be readily allowed that the Grantees

could not intend ſuch Laws, not only on account of their Inconſiſtency with the Grant, but becauſe their Acceptance of a Charter, ſubjecting them to ſuch Laws, would be voluntary Slavery.</p>
            <p>Your Excellenny next obſerves, "that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contended that by the Liberties of free and natural Subjects is to be underſtood an Exemption from Acts of Parliament, becauſe not repreſented there, ſeeing it is provided by the ſame Charter, that ſuch Acts ſhall be in Force."—If the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations we have made above, and our Reaſoning on them be Juſt, it will appear that no ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is made in the Charter, and therefore that the Deductions and Inferences derived from the Suppoſition of ſuch Proviſion, are not well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And with Reſpect to Repreſentation in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as it is one of the eſſential Liberties of free and natural Subjects, and properly makes thoſe who enjoy it liable to Parliamentary Acts, ſo in Reference to the Inhabitants of this Province, who are intitled to all the Liberties of ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Impoſſibility of their being duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Parliament, does clearly exempt them from all ſuch Acts at leaſt, as have been or ſhall be made by Parliament to Tax them: Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Taxation being in our Opinion conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionally inſeperable.</p>
            <p>"This Grant of Liberties and Immunities, your Excellency informs us, is nothing more than a Declaration and Aſſurance on the Part of the Crown, that the Place to which our Predeceſſors were about to remove, was and would be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as Part of the Dominions of the Crown,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012856_0026_0F8B9540E678B970"/>
and therefore that the Subjects ſo removing would not become Aliens, but would, both without and within the Colony retain the Liberties and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of free and natural Subjects."</p>
            <p>The Dominion of the Crown over this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try before the Arrival of our Predeceſſors was meerly ideal. Their Removal hither realized that Dominion, and has made the Country valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both to the Crown and Nation, without any Coſt to either of them from that Time to this. Even in the moſt diſtreſſed State of our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, when they expected to be deſtroyed by a general Conſpiracy and Incurſion of the Indian Natives, they had no Aſſiſtance from them. This Grant then of Liberties, which is the only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration they received from the Crown for ſo valuable an Acquiſition to it, inſtead of being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by military Power, or explained away by nice Inferences and Diſtinctions, ought in Juſtice, and with a generous Openneſs and Freedom, to be acknowledged by every Miniſter of the Crown, and preſerved ſacred from every Species of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>"If the Plantation be Part of the Dominions of the Crown this Clauſe in the Charter (grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liberties and Immunities) does not, your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency obſerves, confer or reſerve any Liberties but what would have been enjoyed without it; and what the Inhabitants of every other Colony do enjoy, where they are without a Charter."—Although the Colonies conſidered as Part of the Dominions of the Crown are intitled to equal Liberties, the Inhabitants of this Colony think it
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012856_0027_0F8B9541A36A4CA8"/>
a Happineſs, that thoſe Liberties are confirmed and ſecured to them by a Charter; whereby the Honour and Faith of the Crown are pledged, that thoſe Liberties ſhall not be violated. And for Protection in them we humbly look up to his preſent Majeſty, our rightful and lawful Sovereign, as Children to a Father, able and diſpoſed to aſſiſt and relieve them; humbly imploring his Majeſty, that his Subjects of this Province, ever faithful and loyal, and ever accounted ſuch till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Stamp-Act exiſted, and who in the late War, and upon all other Occaſions, have demonſtrated that Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Loyalty by their vigorous and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled Exertions in his Service, may have their Grievances redreſſed, and be reſtored to their juſt Rights.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency next obſerves "that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Rights of Engliſh Subjects ſhould be the ſame in every Reſpect, in all Parts of the Dominions," and Inſtances in the Right of being "governed by Laws made by Perſons, in whoſe Election they have a Voice." When "they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the Kingdom to the Plantations where it cannot be enjoyed," you aſk, "will it not be ſaid, that by this their voluntary Removal, they have relinquiſhed, for a Time at leaſt, one of the Rights of an Engliſh Subject, which they might if they pleaſed, have continued to enjoy, and may again enjoy whenſoever they will return to the Place where it can be exerciſed."</p>
            <p>When Engliſh Subjects remove from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Plantations with their Properties, they not only relinquiſh that Right <hi>de facto,</hi> but it
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012856_0028_0F8B9543E1702A58"/>
ought to ceaſe in the Kingdom <hi>de jure.</hi> But it does not from thence follow, that they relinquiſh that Right, in Reference to the Plantation or Colony to which they remove. On the contrary, being become Inhabitants of that Colony, and qualified according to the Laws of it, they can exerciſe that Right equally with the other Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of it. And this Right, on like Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will travel with them through all the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherein a Legiſlature, ſimilar to that of the Kingdom, is eſtabliſhed. And therefore in this Reſpect, and we ſuppoſe in all other eſſential Reſpects, it is not impoſſible the Rights of Engliſh Subjects ſhould be the ſame in all Parts of the Dominions" under a like Form of Legiſlature.</p>
            <p>This Right of Repreſentation is ſo eſſential and indiſpenſible in Regard of all Laws for levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Taxes, that a People under any Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment deſtitute of it, is deſtitute of Freedom—of that Degree of Freedom, for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, Government was inſtituted; and without which, Government degenerates to Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm. It cannot therefore be given up, or taken away, without making a Breach on the eſſential Rights of Nature.</p>
            <p>But your Excellency is pleaſed to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they "who claim Exemption as Part of their Rights by Nature, ſhould conſider that every Reſtraint which Men are laid under by a State of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a Privation of Part of their natural Rights. Even in Caſe of Repreſentation by Election, do they not give up Part of their natural Rights, when they conſent to be repreſented by ſuch
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012856_0029_0F8B954466700EB0"/>
Perſons as ſhall be choſen by the Majority of the Electors, although their own Voices may be for ſome other Perſon? And is it not contrary to their natural Rights to be obliged to ſubmit to a Repreſentative for ſeven Years, or even one Year, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fter they are diſſatisfied with his Conduct, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they gave their Voices for him, when he was elected? This muſt therefore be conſidered as an Objection againſt a State of Government rather than againſt any particular Form."</p>
            <p>Your Excellency's Premiſſes are true, but we do not think your Concluſion follows from them. It is true, that every Reſtraint of Government is a Privation of natural Right: and the two Caſes you have been pleaſed to mention, may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of that Privation. But as they ariſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from the Nature of Society and Government; and as Government is neceſſary to ſecure other natural Rights infinitely more valuable, they cannot therefore be conſidered as an Objection either "againſt a State of Government" or "againſt any particular Form of it."</p>
            <p>Life, Liberty, Property, and the Diſpoſal of that Property with our own Conſent, are natural Rights. Will any one put the other in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with theſe, or infer that becauſe thoſe other muſt be given up in a State of Government, theſe muſt be given up alſo? The Preſervation of theſe Rights is the great End of Government: but is it probable they will be effectually ſecured by a Governor, which the Proprietors of them have no Part in the Direction of, and over which they have no Power or Influence whatever?
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012856_0030_0F8B9544F6B789B0"/>
Hence is deducible, Repreſentation: which being neceſſary to preſerve theſe invaluable Rights of Nature, is itſelf, for that Reaſon, a natural Right, coinciding with, and running into, that great Law of Nature, Self-Preſervation.</p>
            <p>Thus have we conſidered the moſt material Parts of your Speech, and agreeable to your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire diſcloſed to you our Sentiments on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it.</p>
            <p>"Independence, as your Excellency rightly judged, we have not in Contemplation." We cannot however adopt "your Principles of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment," or acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We have the higheſt Reſpect for that auguſt Body the Parliament, and do not preſume to preſcribe the exact Limits of its Authority, yet with the Deference that is due to it, we are humbly of Opinion, that as all human Authority in the Nature of it, is and ought to be limited, it cannot conſtitutionally extend, for the Reaſons we have above ſuggeſted, to the levying of Taxes in any Form, on his Majeſty's Subjects of this Province.</p>
            <p>In ſuch Principles as theſe "our Predeceſſors were eaſy and happy:" and in the due Operation of ſuch, their Deſcendants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e preſent Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Province have been eaſy and happy: but they are not ſo now. Their Uneaſineſs and Unhappineſs are derived from Acts of Parliament, and Regulations of Government, that lately and

within a few Years paſt have been made. And this Uneaſineſs and Unhappineſs, both in the Cauſe and Effects of them, though your Excellency <hi>ſeems</hi> and can only ſeem, to be of a different Opinion, have extended and continue to extend to all the Colonies throughout the Continent.</p>
            <p>It would give us the higheſt Satisfaction to ſee Happineſs and Tranquility reſtored to the Colonies; and eſpecially to ſee between Great-Britain and them an Union eſtabliſhed on ſuch an equitable Baſis as neither of them ſhall ever wiſh to deſtroy.

            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Excellency's Speech to the General Aſſembly at the Opening of this Seſſion, has been read with great Attention in this Houſe.</p>
            <p>We fully agree with your Excellency, that our own Happineſs as well as his Majeſty's Service, very much depends upon Peace and Order; and we ſhall at all Times take ſuch Meaſures as are conſiſtent with our Conſtitution and the Rights of the People to promote and maintain them. That the Government at preſent is in a very diſturbed State is apparent! But we cannot aſcribe it to the People's having adopted unconſtitutional Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which ſeems to be the Cauſe aſſigned for it by your Excellency. It appears to us to have been occaſioned rather, by the Britiſh Houſe of Commons aſſuming and exerciſing a Power incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Freedom of the Conſtitution, to give and grant the Property of the Coloniſts, and appropriate the ſame without their Conſent.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs for us to enquire what were the Principles that induced the Councils of the Nation to ſo new and unprecedented a Meaſure. But when the Parliament by an Act of their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012856_0033_0F8B954A494B6500"/>
declared, that the King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Nation "have, ever had, and of Right ought to have full Power and Authority to make Laws and Statutes of ſufficient Force and Validity to bind the Colonies and People of America, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Crown of Great-Britain, in all Caſes whatever," and in Conſequence hereof another Revenue Act was made, the Minds of the People were filled with Anxiety, and they were juſtly alarmed with Apprehenſions of the total Extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Liberties.</p>
            <p>The Reſult of the free Enquiries of many Perſons into the Right of the Parliament to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe ſuch a Power over the Colonies, ſeems in your Excellency's Opinion, to be the Cauſe of what you are pleaſed to call the preſent "diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed State of the Government;" upon which you "may not any longer conſiſtent with your Duty to the King, and your Regard to the Intereſt of the Province, delay communicating your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents." But that the Principles adopted in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence hereof, are unconſtitutional, is a Subject of Enquiry. We know of no ſuch Diſorders ariſing therefrom as are mentioned by your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. If Grand Jurors have not on their Oaths found ſuch Offences, as your Excellency with the Advice of his Majeſty's Council have <hi>ordered</hi> to be proſecuted, it is to be preſumed they have followed the Dictates of good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>They</hi> are the conſtitutional Judges of theſe Matters; and it is not to be ſuppoſed, that moved from corrupt Principles, they have ſuffered Offenders to eſcape a Proſecution, and thus ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and encouraged them to go on offending.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012856_0034_0F8B954B0027CB80"/>
If any Part of Authority, ſhall in an unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional Manner, interpoſe in any Matter, it will be no wonder if it be brought into Contempt; to the leſſening or confounding of that Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which is neceſſary to a well regulated State. Your Excellency's Repreſentation that the Bands of Government are weakened, we humbly conceive to be without good Grounds; though we muſt own the heavy Burthens uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally brought upon the People have been and ſtill are univerſally and very juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of as a Grievance.</p>
            <p>You are pleaſed to ſay, that "when our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors firſt took Poſſeſſion of this Plantation or Colony, under a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it was their Senſe, and it was the Senſe of the Kingdom, that they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſubject to the Supreme Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;" whereby we underſtand your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to mean in the Senſe of the Declaratory Act of Parliament aforementioned, in all Caſes whatever. And indeed it is difficult, if poſſible, to draw a Line of Diſtinction between the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Authority of Parliament over the Colonies, and no Authority at all. It is therefore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to enquire how it appears, for your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency has not ſhown it to us, that when or at the Time that our Predeceſſors took Poſſeſſion of this Plantation or Colony, under a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it was <hi>their Senſe,</hi> and the Senſe of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that they were to remain ſubject to the Supreme Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. In making this Enquiry, we ſhall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Excellency's Recommendation,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012856_0035_0F8B954BB7B513F0"/>
treat the Subject with Calmneſs and Candor, and alſo with a due Regard to Truth.</p>
            <p>Previous to a direct Conſideration of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter granted to this Province or Colony, and the better to elucidate the true Senſe and Meaning of it, we would take a View of the State of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh North American Continent at the Time when and after Poſſeſſion was firſt taken of any Part of it, by the Europeans. It was then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by Heathen and Barbarous People, who had nevertheleſs all that Right to the Soil and Sovereignty in and over the Lands they poſſeſſed, which God had originally given to Man. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their being Heathen, inferred any Right or Authority to Chriſtian Princes, a Right which had long been aſſumed by the Pope, to diſpoſe of their Lands to others, we will leave to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency or any one of Underſtanding and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judgment to conſider. It is certain they had in no other Senſe forfeited them to any Power in Europe. Should the Doctrine be admitted that Diſcovery of Lands owned and poſſeſſed by Pagan People, gives to any Chriſtian Prince a Right and Title to the Dominion and Property, ſtill it is veſted in the Crown alone. It was an Acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Foreign Territory, not annexed to the Realm of England, and therefore at the abſolute Diſpoſal of the Crown. For we take it to be a ſettled Point, that the King has a conſtitutional Prerogative to diſpoſe of and alienate any Part of his Territories not annexed to the Realm. In the Exerciſe of this Prerogative, Queen Elizabeth granted the firſt American Charter; and claiming a Right by Virtue of Diſcovery, then ſuppoſed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012856_0036_0F8B954C78D89CC0"/>
to be valid, to the Lands which are now poſſeſſed by the Colony of Virginia, ſhe conveyed to Sir Walter Rawleigh, the Property, Dominion and Sovereignty thereof, to be held of the Crown by Homage, and a certain Render, without any Reſervation to herſelf of any Share in the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative and Executive Authority. After the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of Sir Walter, King James the Firſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated two Virginia Companies, to be governed each by Laws tranſmitted to them by his Majeſty, and not by the Parliament, with Power to eſtabliſh and cauſe to be made a Coin to paſs current a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and veſted with all Liberties, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes and Immunities within any of his other Dominions, to all Intents and Purpoſes, as if they had been abiding, and born <hi>within the Realm.</hi> A Declaration ſimilar to this is contained in the firſt Charter of this Colony, and in thoſe of other American Colonies; which ſhows that the Colonies were not intended or conſidered to be within the Realm of England, though within the Allegiance of the Engliſh Crown. After this, another Charter was granted by the ſame King James, to the Treaſurer and Company of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, veſting them with full Power and Authority, to make, ordain and eſtabliſh all Manner of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Laws, Directions, Inſtructions, Forms and Ceremonies of Government and Magiſtracy, fit and neceſſary, and the ſame to abrogate, &amp;c. without any Reſervation for ſecuring their Subjection to the Parliament and future Laws of England. A third Charter was afterwards granted by the ſame King to the Treaſurer and Company of Virginia, veſting them with Power and Authority to make Laws, with an Addition of this Clauſe, "ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012856_0037_0F8B954D63797F48"/>
that the ſame be not contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this our Realm of England." The ſame Clauſe was afterwards copied into the Charter of this and other Colonies, with certain Variations, ſuch as that theſe Laws ſhould be "conſonant to Reaſon," "not repugnant to the Laws of England," "as nearly as conveniently may be to the Laws, Statutes and Rights of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land." &amp;c. Theſe Modes of Expreſſion convey the ſame Meaning, and ſerve to ſhow an Intention that the Laws of the Colonies ſhould be as much as poſſible, conformant in the Spirit of them to the Principles and fundamental Laws of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Conſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its Rights and Statutes then in Being; and by no Means to bind the Colonies to a Subjection to the Supreme Authority of the Engliſh Parliament. And that this is the true Intention, we think it further evident from this Conſideration, that no Acts of any Colony Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative, are ever brought into Parliament for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection there, though the Laws made in ſome of them, like the Acts of the Britiſh Parliament are laid before the King for his Aſſent or Diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>We have brought the firſt American Charters into View, and the State of the Country when they were granted, to ſhow that the Right of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Lands was in the Opinion of thoſe Times veſted ſolely in the Crown—that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Charters conveyed to the Grantees, who ſhould ſettle upon the Territories therein granted, all the Powers neceſſary to conſtitute them free and diſtinct States—and that the fundamental Laws of the Engliſh Conſtitution ſhould be the certain
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012856_0038_0F8B9551CBC8CCC8"/>
and eſtabliſhed Rule of Legiſlation, to which the Laws to be made in the ſeveral Colonies were to be as nearly as conveniently might be, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or ſimilar; which was the true Intent and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Words, "not repugnant to the Laws of England," "conſonant to Reaſon," and other variant Expreſſions in the different Charters. And we would add, that the King in ſome of the Charters reſerves the Right to judge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonance and Similarity of their Laws with the Engliſh Conſtitution to himſelf, and not to the Parliament; and in Conſequence thereof to affirm, or within a limited Time, diſallow them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Charters, as well as that afterwards granted to Lord Baltimore, and other Charters, are repugnant to the Idea of Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: And to ſuppoſe a Parliamentary Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Colonies under ſuch Charters, would neceſſarily induce that Soleciſm in Politics <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium in Imperio.</hi> And the King's repeatedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the Prerogative of diſpoſing of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Territory by ſuch Charters, together with the Silence of the Nation thereupon, is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it was an acknowledged Prerogative.</p>
            <p>But further to ſhow the Senſe of the Engliſh Crown and Nation that the American Coloniſts and our Predeceſſors in particular, when they firſt took Poſſeſſion of this Country by a Grant and Charter from the Crown, did not remain ſubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament, we beg Leave to obſerve; that when a Bill was offered by the two Houſes of Parliament to King Charles the Firſt, granting to the Subjects of England the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012856_0039_0F8B9552868259F0"/>
free Liberty of Fiſhing on the Coaſt of America, he refuſed his Royal Aſſent, declaring as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that "the Colonies were <hi>without the Realm and Juriſdiction of Parliament.</hi>"</p>
            <p>In like Manner, his Predeceſſor James the Firſt, had before declared upon a ſimilar Occaſion, that America <hi>was not annexed to the Realm,</hi> and it was not fitting that Parliament ſhould make Laws for thoſe Countries." This Reaſon was, not ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but openly declared in Parliament. If then the Colonies were not annexed to the Realm, at the Time when their Charters were granted, they never could be afterwards, without their own ſpecial Conſent, which has never ſince been had, or even aſked. If they are not now annexed to the Realm, they are not a Part of the Kingdom, and conſequently not ſubject to the Legiſlative Authority of the Kingdom. For no Country, by the Common Law was ſubject to the Laws or to the Parliament, but the Realm of England.</p>
            <p>We would if your Excellency pleaſes, ſubjoin an Inſtance of Conduct in King Charles the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, ſingular indeed, but important to our Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; who, in 1679, framed an Act for a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Revenue for the Support of Virginia, and ſent it there by Lord Colpepper, the Governor of that Colony; which was afterwards paſſed into a Law, and <hi>"Enacted by the King's moſt excellent Majeſty, by and with the Conſent of the General Aſſembly of Virginia."</hi> If the King had judged that Colony to be a Part of the Realm, he would not, nor could he conſiſtently with Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, have placed himſelf at the Head of, and joined
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012856_0040_0F8B955341AAC200"/>
with any Legiſlative Body in making a Law to Tax the People there, other than the Lords and Commons of England.</p>
            <p>Having taken a View of the ſeveral Charters of the firſt Colony in America, if we look into the old Charter of this Colony, we ſhall find it to be grounded on the ſame Principle: That the Right of diſpoſing the Territory granted therein was veſted in the Crown, as being that Chriſtian Sovereign who firſt diſcovered it, when in the Poſſeſſion of Heathen; and that it was conſidered as being not within the Realm, but only within the Fee and Seignory of the King. As therefore it was without the Realm of England, muſt not the King, if he had deſigned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat the Parliament ſhould have had any Authority over it, have made a ſpecial Reſervation for that Purpoſe? which was not done.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency ſays, it appears from the Charter itſelf, to have been the Senſe of our Predeceſſors who firſt took Poſſeſſion of this Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Colony, that they were to remain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Authority of Parliament. You have not been pleaſed to point out to us how this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Charter, unleſs it be in the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation you make on the above-mentioned Clauſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "That a favourable Conſtruction has been put upon this Clauſe, when it has been allowed to intend ſuch Laws of England only as are expreſly made to reſpect us," which you ſay "is by Charter a Reſerve of Power and Authority to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to bind us by ſuch Laws at leaſt as are made expreſly to refer to us, and conſequently is
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012856_0041_0F8B9553F98CA698"/>
a Limitation of the Power given to the General Court." But we would ſtill recur to the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter itſelf, and aſk your Excellency, How this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from thence to have been the Senſe of our Predeceſſors? Is any Reſervation of Power and Authority to Parliament thus to bind us, expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or implied in the Charter? It is evident, that King Charles the firſt, the very Prince who granted it, as well as his Predeceſſor, had no ſuch Idea of the ſupreme Authority of Parliament over the Colony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from their Declarations before recited. Your Excellency will then allow us further to aſk, by what Authority in Reaſon or Equity the Parliament can enforce a Conſtruction ſo <hi>unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable</hi> to us. <hi>Quod ab initi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In ſolemn Agreements ſubſequent Reſtrictions ought never to be allowed. The celebrated Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor whom your Excellency has quoted, tells us that "neither the one or the other of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted or contracting Powers hath a right to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret at Pleaſure." This we mention to ſhow, even upon a Suppoſition that the Parliament had been a Party to the Contract, the Invalidity of any of its ſubſequent Acts, to explain any Clauſe in the Charter; more eſpecially to reſtrict or make void any Clauſe granted therein to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court. An Agreement ought to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted "in ſuch a Manner as that it may have <hi>its Effect:</hi>" But if your Excellency's Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012856_0042_0F8B9554DD9188C8"/>
of this Clauſe is juſt, "that it is a Reſerve of Power and Authority to Parliament to bind us by ſuch Laws as are made expreſly to refer to us," it is not only "a Limitation of the Power given to the General Court" to Legiſlate, but it may whenever the Parliament ſhall think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it, render it of <hi>no Effect;</hi> for it puts it in the Power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to bind us by as many Laws as they pleaſe, and even to reſtrain us from making any Laws at all. If your Excellency's Aſſertions in this and the next ſucceeding Part of your Speech were well grounded, the Concluſion would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, that the Charter even in this Clauſe, "does not confer or reſerve any Liberties" worth enjoying, "but what would have been enjoyed without it;" ſaving that within any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Dominions we are to be conſidered barely as <hi>not Aliens.</hi> You are pleaſed to ſay, it cannot "be contended that by the Liberties of free and natural Subjects" (which are expreſly granted in the Charter to all Intents, Purpoſes, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions whatever) "is to underſtood an Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Acts of Parliament becauſe not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented there; ſeeing it is provided by the ſame Charter that ſuch Acts ſhall be in Force." If, ſays an eminent Lawyer, "the King grants to the Town of D. the ſame Liberties which London has, this ſhall be intended the like Liberties." A Grant of the Liberties of free and natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is equivalent to a Grant of the ſame Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And the King in the firſt Charter to this Colony expreſsly grants that it ſhall be conſtrued, reputed and adjudged in all Caſes moſt favourably on the Behalf and for the Benefit and Behoof of the ſaid Governor and Company and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors—
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012856_0043_0F8B955905C4C6B0"/>
any Matter, Cauſe or Thing whatſoever to the contrary notwithſtanding." It is one of the Liberties of free and natural Subjects, born and abiding within the Realm, to be governed as your Excellency obſerves, "by Laws made by Perſons in whoſe Elections they from Time to Time have a Voice." This is an eſſential Right. For nothing is more evident, than that any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are ſubject to the unlimited Power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, muſt be in a State of abject Slavery. It was eaſily and plainly foreſeen that the Right of Repreſentation in the Engliſh Parliament could not be exerciſed by the People of this Colony. It would be impracticable, if conſiſtent with the Engliſh Conſtitution. And for this Reaſon, that this Colony might have and enjoy all the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Immunities of free and natural Subjects within the Realm, as ſtipulated in the Charter, it was neceſſary, and a Legiſlative was accordingly conſtituted within the Colony; one Branch of which conſiſts of Repreſentatives choſen by the People, to make all Laws, Statutes, Ordinances, &amp;c. for the well ordering and governing the ſame, not repugnant to the Laws of England, or, as nearly as conveniently might be, agreeable to the fundamental Laws of the Engliſh Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We are therefore ſtill at a Loſs to conceive where your Excellency finds it "<hi>provided</hi> in the ſame Charter, that ſuch Acts," <abbr>viz.</abbr> Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made expreſsly to refer to us, "ſhall be in Force" in this Province. There is nothing to this Purpoſe expreſſed in the Charter, or in our Opinion even implied in it. And ſurely it would be very abſurd, that a Charter, which is evidently formed upon a Suppoſition and Intention, that a
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012856_0044_0F8B9559B85FCB10"/>
Colony is and ſhould be conſidered as not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm; and declared by the very Prince who granted it, to be not within the Juriſdiction of Parliament, ſhould yet <hi>provide,</hi> that the Laws which the ſame Parliament ſhould make expreſly to refer to that Colony, ſhould be in Force there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Your Excellency is pleaſed to aſk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Does it follow that the Government by their (our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors) Removal from one Part of the Dominions to another, loſes its Authority over that Part to which they remove: And that they were freed from the Subjection they were under before?" We anſwer, if that Part of the King's Dominions to which they removed was not then a Part of the Realm, and was never annexed to it, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament loſt no Authority over it, having never had ſuch Authority; and the Emigrants were conſequently freed from the Subjection they were under before their Removal: The Power and Authority of Parliament being conſtitutionally confined within the Limits of the Realm and the Nation collectively, of which alone it is the Repreſenting and Legiſlative Aſſembly. Your Excellency further aſks, "Will it not rather be ſaid, that by this their voluntary Removal, they have relinquiſhed for a Time at leaſt, one of the Rights of an Engliſh Subject, which they might if they pleaſed have continued to enjoy, and may again enjoy, whenever they return to the Place where it can be exerciſed?" To which we anſwer; They never did relinquiſh the Right to be governed by Laws made by Perſons in whoſe Election they had a Voice The King ſtipulated with them that they ſhould have and enjoy all the Liberties of free and natural Subjects born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012856_0045_0F8B955BF276E648"/>
the Realm, to all Intents, Purpoſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions whatſoever; that is, that they ſhould be as free as thoſe who were to abide within the Realm: Conſequently he ſtipulated with them that they ſhould enjoy and exerciſe this moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Right, which diſcriminates Freemen from Vaſſals, uninterruptedly in its full Senſe and Meaning; and they did and ought ſtill to exerciſe it, without the Neceſſity of returning, for the Sake of exerciſing it, to the Nation or State of England.</p>
            <p>We cannot help obſerving, that your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's Manner of Reaſoning on this Point, ſeems to us to render the moſt valuable Clauſes in our Charter unintelligible: As if Perſons going from the Realm of England to inhabit in America, ſhould hold and exerciſe there a certain Right of Engliſh Subjects; but in Order to exerciſe it in ſuch Manner as to be of any Benefit to them, they muſt <hi>not inhabit</hi> there, but return to the Place where alone it can be exerciſed. By ſuch Conſtruction, the Words of the Charter can have no Senſe or Meaning. We forbear remarking upon the Abſurdity of a Grant to Perſons born within the Realm, of the ſame Liberties which would have belonged to them if they had been born within the Realm.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency is diſpoſed to compare this Government to the Variety of Corporations form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Kingdom, with Power to make and execute By-Laws, &amp;c. And becauſe they remain ſubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament, to infer that this Colony is alſo ſubject to the ſame
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012856_0046_0F8B955C40AF81B0"/>
Authority: This Reaſoning appears to us not juſt. The Members of thoſe Corporations are Reſiant within the Kingdom; and Reſidence ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them to the Authority of Parliament, in which they are alſo repreſented: Whereas the People of this Colony are not Reſident within the Realm. The Charter was granted with the expreſs Purpoſe to induce them to reſide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Realm; conſequently they are not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Parliament there. But we would aſk your Excellency; Are any of the Corporations formed within the Kingdom, veſted with the Power of erecting other ſubordinate Corporations? Of enacting and determining what Crimes ſhall be Capital? And conſtituting Courts of Common Law with all their Officers, for the hearing, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and puniſhing capital Offenders with Death? Theſe and many other Powers veſted in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, plainly ſhow that it is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Corporation in no other Light, than as every State is a Corporation. Beſides, Appeals from the Courts of Law here, are not brought before the Houſe of Lords; which ſhows that the Peers of the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m are not the Peers of America: But all ſuch Appeals are brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King in Council, which is a further Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we are not within the Realm.</p>
            <p>We conceive enough has been ſaid to convince your Excellency, that "when our Predeceſſors firſt took Poſſeſſion of this Plantation or Colony by a Grant and Charter from the Crown of England, it <hi>was not</hi> and never had been the Senſe of the Kingdom, that they were to remain ſubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament. We will now
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012856_0047_0F8B955CFA268920"/>
with your Excellency's Leave, enquire what <hi>was</hi> the Senſe of our Anceſtors of this very important Matter.</p>
            <p>And as your Excellency has been pleaſed to tell us, you have not diſcovered that the Supreme Authority of Parliament has been called in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even by private and particular Perſons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til within ſeven or eight Years paſt; except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Time of the Anarchy and Confuſion in England, which preceeded the Reſtoration of King Charles the Second; we beg leave to remind your Excellency of ſome Parts of your own Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Maſſachuſetts-Bay. Therein we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Sentiments of "Perſons of Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence" after the Reſtoration, from which the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian tells us, ſome Parts of their Conduct, that is of the General Aſſembly, "may be pretty well accounted for." By the Hiſtory it appears to have been the Opinion of thoſe Perſons of Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, "that the Subjects of any Prince or State had a natural Right to remove to any other State or to another Quarter of the World, unleſs the State was weakened or expoſed by ſuch Remove; and even in that Caſe, if they were deprived of the Right of all Mankind, Liberty of Conſcience, it would juſtify a Separation, and <hi>upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval their Subjection determined and ceaſed.</hi>" That "the Country to which they had removed, was claimed and poſſeſſed by independent Princes, whoſe Right to the Lordſhip and Sovereignty thereof had been acknowledged by the Kings of England," an Inſtance of which is quoted in the Margin; "That the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> themſelves had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally purchaſed for valuable Conſideration, not
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012856_0048_0F8B955DDCF56808"/>
only the Soil, but the Dominion, the Lordſhip and Sovereignty of thoſe Princes;" without which Purchaſe, "in the Sight of God and Men, they had no Right or Title to what they poſſeſſed. That they had received a Charter of Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the King, from whence aroſe a new Kind of Subjection, namely, "a voluntary, civil Subjection;" and by this Compact "they were <hi>to be governed by Laws made by themſelves.</hi>" Thus it appears to have been the Sentiments of <hi>private</hi> Perſons, though Perſons by whoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the public Conduct was influenced, that their Removal was a juſtifiable Separation from the Mother State, upon which their Subjection to that State determined and ceaſed. The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority of Parliament, if it had then ever been aſſerted, muſt ſurely have been called in Queſtion, by Men who had advanced ſuch Principles as theſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt Act of Parliament made expreſly to refer to the Colonies, was after the Reſtoration. In the Reign of King Charles the Second, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſuch Acts paſſed. And the ſame Hiſtory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us there was a Difficulty in conforming to them; and the Reaſon of this Difficulty is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in a Letter of the General Aſſembly to their Agent, quoted in the following Words, "They apprehended them to be an Invaſion of the Rights Liberties and Properties of the Subjects of his Majeſty in the Colony, <hi>they not being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Parliament,</hi> and according to the uſual Sayings of the Learned in the Law, the Laws of England were bounded within the four Seas, <hi>and did not reach America:</hi> However as
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012856_0049_0F8B955E77B27BE0"/>
his Majeſty had ſignified his Pleaſure that thoſe Acts ſhould be obſerved in the Maſſachuſetts, they had made Proviſion by a Law of the Colony that they ſhould be ſtrictly attended." Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion by a Law of their own would have been ſuperfluous, if they had admitted the Supreme Authority of Parliament. In ſhort, by the ſame Hiſtory it appears that thoſe Acts of Parliament as ſuch were diſregarded; and the following Reaſon is given for it; "It ſeems to have been a <hi>general</hi> Opinion that Acts of Parliament had no other Force, than what they derived from Acts made by the General Court to eſtabliſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them."</p>
            <p>But ſtill further to ſhow the Senſe of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors reſpecting this Matter, we beg leave to recite ſome Parts of a Narrative preſented to the Lords of Privy Council by Edward Randolph, in the Year 1676, which we find in your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's Collection of Papers lately publiſhed. Therein it is declared to be the Senſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, "that no Law is in Force or Eſteem there, but ſuch as are made by the General Court; and therefore it is accounted a Breach of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and a Betraying of the Liberties of their Common-wealth, to urge the Obſervation of the Laws of England." And further, "That no Oath ſhall be urged or required to be taken by any Perſon, but ſuch Oath as the General Court hath conſidered, allowed and required." And further, "there is no notice taken of the Act of Navigation, Plantation or any other Laws made in England for the Regulation of Trade." "That the Government would make the World believe
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012856_0050_0F8B9564DC5A4D00"/>
they are a free State, and do act in all Matters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly." Again, "Theſe Magiſtrates ever reſerve to themſelves a Power to alter, evade and diſannul any Law or Command, not agreeing with their Humour o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the abſolute Authority of their Government, acknowledging no Superior." And further, "He the (Governor) freely declared to me, that the Laws <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>de by your Majeſty and your Parliament, obligeth them in nothing, but what conſiſts with the Intereſts of that Colony, that the Legiſlative Power and Authority is and abides in them <hi>ſolely.</hi>" And in the ſame Mr. Randolph's Letter to the Biſhop of London, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 14, 1682, he ſays, "This <hi>Independency</hi> in Government, claimed and daily practiſed." And your Excellency being <hi>then</hi> ſenſible that this was the Senſe of our Anceſtors, in a Marginal Note in the ſame Collection of Papers, obſerves, that "this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Proviſion made for obſerving the Acts of Trade, "is very extraordinary, for this Proviſion was an Act of the Colony declaring the Acts of Trade ſhall be in Force there." Although Mr. Randolph was very unfriendly to the Colony, yet as his Declarations are concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with thoſe recited from your Excellency's Hiſtory, we think they may be admitted for the Purpoſe for which they are now brought.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee, from your Excellency's Hiſtory and Publications, the Senſe our Anceſtors had of the Juriſdiction of Parliament under the firſt Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Very different from that which your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency <hi>in your Speech</hi> apprehends it to have been.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:012856_0051_0F8B9565974A8A28"/>
It appears by Mr. Neal's Hiſtory of New-England, that the Agents who had been employed by the Colony to tranſacts it Affairs in England at the Time when the preſent Charter was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther Reaſons gave the following for their Acceptance of it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "The General Court has with the King's Approbation as much Power in New-England, as the King and Parliament have in England; they have all Engliſh Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and can be touched by <hi>no Law,</hi> and by no Tax but of their own making." This is the earlieſt Teſtimony that can be given of the Senſe our Predeceſſors had of the Supreme Authority of Parliament under the preſent Charter. And it plainly ſhows, that they, who having been free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſant with thoſe who framed the Charter, muſt have well underſtood the Deſign and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, ſuppoſed that the Terms in our Charter "full Power and Authority," intended and were conſidered as a <hi>ſole</hi> and excluſive Power, and that there was no "Reſerve in the Charter to the Authority of Parliament, to bind the Colony" by any Acts whatever.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Arrival of the Charter, <abbr>viz.</abbr> in 1692, your Excellency's Hiſtory informs us, "the firſt Act" of this Legiſlative was a Sort of Magna Charta, aſſerting and ſetting forth their general Privileges, and this Clauſe was among the reſt, "No Aid, Tax, Tallage, Aſſeſſment, Cuſtom, Loan, Benevolence or Impoſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhall be laid, aſſeſs'd, impos'd or levied on any of their Majeſty's Subjects, or their Eſtates, on any Pretence whatever, but by the Act and Conſent of the Governor, Council and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012856_0052_0F8B9565F9E44060"/>
of the People aſſembled in General Court." And though this Act was diſallowed, it ſerves to ſhow the Senſe which the General Aſſembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with the granting the Charter had of their ſole and excluſive Right to Legiſlate for the Colony. The Hiſtory ſays, "the other Parts of the Act were copied from Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;" by which we may conclude that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly then conſtrued the Words "not repugnant to the Laws," to mean, conformable to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principles of the Engliſh Conſtitution. And it is obſervable that the Lords of Privy Council, ſo lately as in the Reign of Queen Anne, when ſeveral Laws enacted by the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, were laid before her Majeſty for her Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, interpreted the Words in this Charter, "not repugnant to the Laws of England," by the Words "as nearly as conveniently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be agreeable to the Laws and Statutes of England." And her Majeſty was pleaſed to diſallow thoſe Acts, not becauſe they were repugnant to any Law or Statute of England, made expreſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the Colony; but becauſe divers Perſons, by Virtue thereof, were puniſhed without being tried by their Peers in the ordinary "Courts of Law," and "by the ordinary Rules and known Methods of Juſtice;" contrary to the expreſs Terms of Magna Charta, which was a Statute in Force at the Time of granting the Charter, and declaratory of the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subjects within the Realm.</p>
            <p>You are pleaſed to ſay, that "our Provincial or Local Laws have in numerous Inſtances had Relation to Acts of Parliament made to reſpect
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012856_0053_0F8B9566C1FA35D8"/>
the Plantations and this Colony in particular." The Authority of the Legiſlature, ſays the ſame Author who is quoted by your Excellency, "does not extend ſo far as the Fundamentals of the Conſtitution." "They ought to conſider the Fundamental Laws as ſacred, if the Nation has not in very expreſs Terms, given them the Power to change them. For the Conſtitution of the State ought to be fixed: And ſince that was firſt eſtabliſhed by the Nation, which afterwards truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain Perſons with the Legiſlative Power, the fundamental Laws are excepted from their Commiſſion." Now the Fundamentals of the Conſtitution of this Province are ſtipulated in the Charter; the Reaſoning therefore in this Caſe holds equally good. Much leſs then ought any Acts or Doings of the General Aſſembly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever numerous, to neither of which your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency has pointed us, which barely relate to Acts of Parliament made to reſpect the Plantations in general, or this Colony in particular, to be taken as an Acknowledgment of this People, or even of the Aſſembly, which inadvertently paſſed thoſe Acts, that we are ſubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament. And with ſtill leſs Reaſon are the Deciſions in the Executive Courts to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this Point. If they have adopted that "as Part of the Rule of Law," which in Fact is not, it muſt be imputed to Inattention or Error in Judgment, and cannot juſtly be urged as an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Reſtriction of the Legiſlative Authority of the Province.</p>
            <p>Before we leave this Part of your Excellency's Speech, we would obſerve, that the great Deſign
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012856_0054_0F8B95679EA780F0"/>
of our Anceſtors, in leaving the Kingdom of England, was to be freed from a Subjection to its ſpiritual Laws and Courts, and to worſhip God according to the Dictates of their Conſciences. Your Excellency in your Hiſtory obſerves, that their Deſign was "to obtain for themſelves and their Poſterity the Liberty of worſhipping God in ſuch Manner as appeared to them moſt agreeable to the ſacred Scriptures." And the General Court themſelves declared in 1651, that "ſeeing juſt Cauſe to fear the Perſecution of the then Biſhop, and High Commiſſion for not conforming to the Ceremonies of thoſe under their Power, they thought it their ſafeſt Courſe, to get to this Outſide of the World, out of their View and <hi>beyond their Reach.</hi>" But if it had been their Senſe, that they were ſtill to be ſubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament, they muſt have known that their Deſign might and probably would be fruſtrated; that the Parliament, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering the Temper of thoſe Times, might make what eccleſiaſtical Laws they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, expreſsly to refer to them, and place them in the ſame Circumſtances with Reſpect to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Matters, to be relieved from which was the Deſign of their Removal. And we would add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if your Excellency's Conſtruction of the Clauſe in our preſent Charter is juſt, another Clauſe therein, which provides for Liberty of Conſcience for all Chriſtians except Papiſts, may be rendered void by an Act of Parliament made to refer to us, requiring a Conformity to the Rites and Mode of Worſhip in the Church of England, or any other.</p>
            <p>

Thus we have endeavoured to ſhew the Senſe of the People of this Colony under both Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and if there have been in any late Inſtances a Submiſſion to Acts of Parliament, it has been in our Opinion, rather from Inconſideration or a Reluctance at the Idea of contending with the Parent State, than from a Conviction or Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Supreme Legiſlative Authority of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Your Excllency tells us, "you know of no Line that can be drawn between the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament and the total Independence of the Colonies." If there be no ſuch Line, the Conſequence is, either that the Colonies are the Vaſſals of the Parliament, or, that they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Independent. As it cannot be ſuppoſed to have been the Intention of the Parties in the Compact, that we ſhould be reduced to a State of Vaſſallage, the Concluſion is, that it was their Senſe, that we were thus Independent. "It is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, your Excellency ſays, that there ſhould be two independent Legiſlatures in one and the ſame State." May we not then further conclude, that it was their Senſe that the Colonies were by their Charters made diſtinct States from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country? Your Excellency adds, For although there may be but one Head, the King, yet the two Legiſlative Bodies will make two Governments as diſtinct as the Kingdoms of England and Scotland before the Union. Very true, may it pleaſe your Excellency; and if they interfere not with each other, what hinders but that being united in one Head and common So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, they may live happily in that Connection,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012856_0056_0F8B956CC6169BE8"/>
and mutually ſupport and protect each other? Notwithſtanding all the Terrors which your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency has pictured to us as the Affects of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Independence, there is more Reaſon to dread the Conſequences of abſolute uncontrouled Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, whether of a Nation or a Monarch, than thoſe of a total Independence. It would be a Misfortune "to know by Experience, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Liberties of an Engliſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſt and thoſe of the Spaniſh, French and Dutch: And ſince the Britiſh Parliament has paſſed an Act which is executed even with Rigour, though not voluntarily ſubmitted to, for raiſing a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and appropriating the ſame without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People who pay it, and have claimed a Power making ſuch Laws as they pleaſe to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and govern us, your Excellency will excuſe us in aſking, whether you do not think we alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy experience too much of ſuch a Difference, and have not Reaſon to fear we ſhall ſoon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a worſe Situation than that of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of France, Spain or Holland?</p>
            <p>If your Excellency expects to have the Line of Diſtinction between the Supreme Authority of Parliament, and the total Independence of the Colonies drawn by us, we would ſay it would be an arduous Undertaking; and of very great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to all the other Colonies: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, could we conceive of ſuch a Line, we ſhould be unwilling to propoſe it, without their Conſent in Congreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:012856_0057_0F8B956D79BBC900"/>
To conclude, Theſe are great and profound Queſtions. It is the Grief of this Houſe, that by the ill Policy of a late injudicious Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, America has been driven into the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of them. And we cannot but expreſs our Concern, that your Excellency by your Speech has reduced us to the unhappy Alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, either of appearing by our Silence to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in your Excellency's Sentiments, or of thus freely diſcuſſing this Point.</p>
            <p>After all that we have ſaid, we would be far from being underſtood to have in the leaſt abated that juſt Senſe of Allegiance which we owe to the King of Great-Britain, our rightful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign: And ſhould the People of this Province be left to the free and full Exerciſe of all the Liberties and Immunities granted to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Our Charters reſerve great Power to the Crown in its Repreſentative, fully ſufficient to balance, analagous to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Conſtitution, all the Liberties and Privileges granted to the People. All this your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy knows full well—And whoever conſiders the Power and Influence, in all their Branches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by our Charter to the Crown, will be far from thinking that the Commons of this Province are too Independent.</p>

            <p>I ſhall firſt apply myſelf to you,</p>
            <div type="part">

               <p>The two firſt Parts of your Anſwer, which Reſpect the Diſorders occaſioned by the Stamp-Act and the general Nature of Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, do not appear to me to have a Tendency to invalidate any Thing which I have ſaid in my Speech; for, however the Stamp-Act may have been the immediate Occaſion of any Diſorders, the Authority of Parliament was notwithſtanding denied in Order to juſtify or excuſe them. And, for the Nature of the Supreme Authority of Parliament, I have never given you any Reaſon to ſuppoſe that I intended a more abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Parliament, or a greater Degree of active or paſſive Obedience in the People, than what is founded in the Nature of Government, let the Form of it be what it may. I ſhall, therefore, paſs over thoſe Parts of your Anſwer without any other Remark. I would alſo have ſaved you the Trouble of all thoſe Authorities which you have brought to ſhew, that all Taxes upon Engliſh Subjects muſt be levied by Virtue of the Act not of the King alone but in Conjunction
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012856_0060_0F8B9573EEE34BC0"/>
with the Lords and Commons, for I ſhould very readily have allowed it; and I ſhould as readily have allowed that all other Acts of Legiſlation muſt be paſſed by the ſame joint Authority, and not by the King alone.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I am not willing to continue a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with you upon any other Parts of your Anſwer. I am glad to find that Independence is what you have not in Contemplation; and that you will not preſume to preſcribe the exact Limits of the Authority of Parliament; only, as with due Deference to it, you are humbly of Opinion, that, as all human Authority in the Nature of it is and ought to be limited, it cannot conſtitutionally extend for the Reaſons you have ſuggeſted, to the levying of Taxes in any Form on his Majeſty's Subjects of this Province.</p>
               <p>I will only oberve, that your Attempts to draw a Line as the Limits of the Supreme Authority in Government, by diſtinguiſhing ſome natural Rights as more peculiarly exempt from ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than the reſt, rather tend to evince the Impracticability of drawing ſuch a Line; and that ſome Parts of your Anſwer ſeem to infer a Supremacy in the Province at the ſame Time that you acknowledge the Supremacy of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for otherwiſe the Rights of the Subjects cannot be the ſame in all eſſential Reſpects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you ſuppoſe them to be, in all Parts of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, "under a like Form of Legiſlature."</p>
               <p>From theſe, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I cannot help flattering myſelf, that, upon

more mature Deliberation and in Order to a more conſiſtent Plan of Government, you will chuſe rather to doubt of the Expediency of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Exerciſing its Authority in Caſes that may happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to limit the Authority itſelf, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as you agree with me in the proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of obtaining a Redreſs of Grievances by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional Repreſentations, which cannot well conſiſt with a Denial of the Authority to which the Repreſentations are made; and, from the beſt Information I have been able to obtain, the Denial of the Authority of Parliament, expreſly or by Implication in thoſe Petitions to which you refer was the Cauſe of their not being admitted, and not any Advice given by the Miniſter to the Agents of the Colonies.</p>
               <p>I muſt enlarge and be much more particular in my Reply to you,</p>

               <p>I ſhall take no Notice of that Part of your Anſwer which attributes the Diſorders of the Province to an undue Exerciſe of the Power of Parliament, becauſe you take for granted, what can by no Means be admitted, that Parliament had exerciſed its Power without juſt Authority. The Sum of your Anſwer ſo far as it is pertinent to my Speech, is this.</p>
               <p>You alledge that the Colonies were an Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Foreign Territory not annexed to the Realm of England, and therefore at the <hi>abſolute</hi> Diſpoſal of the Crown; the King having, as you
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012856_0062_0F8B9576E57E01D8"/>
take it, a conſtitutional Right to diſpoſe of and <hi>alienate</hi> any Part of his Territories not annexed to the Realm—that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> accordingly conveyed the Property, <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> of <hi>Virginia</hi> to Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> to be held of the Crown <hi>by Homage and a certain Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> without reſerving any Share in the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Executive Authority—that the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Grants of America were ſimilar in this Reſpect, that they were without any Reſervation for ſecuring the Subjection of the Coloniſts to the Parliament and future Laws of England,—that this was the Senſe of the Engliſh Crown, the Nation and our Predeceſſors when they firſt took Poſſeſſion of this Country—that if the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies were not then annexed to the Realm they cannot have been annexed ſince that Time—that if they are not now annexed to the <hi>Realm</hi> they are not Part of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and conſequently not ſubject to the Legiſlative Authority of the Kingdom; for no Country, by the Common Law, was ſubject to the Laws or to the Parliament but the Realm of England.</p>
               <p>Now if this your Foundation ſhall fail you in every Part of it, as I think it will, the Fabrick which you have raiſed upon it muſt certainly fall.</p>
               <p>Let me then obſerve to you that, as Engliſh Subjects, and agreeable to the Doctrine of Feudal Tenure, all our Lands and Tenements are held me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iately or immediately of the Crown, and although the Poſſeſſion and Uſe or Profits be in the Subject, there ſtill remains a Dominion in the Crown. When any new Countries are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012856_0063_0F8B95773A27B9D0"/>
by Engliſh Subjects, according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law and Uſage of Nations, they become Part of the State, and, according to the Feudal Syſtem, the Lordſhip or Dominion is in the Crown and a Right accrues of diſpoſing of ſuch Territories, under ſuch Tenure or for ſuch Services to be performed as the Crown ſhall judge proper, and whenſoever any Part of ſuch Territories, by Grant from the Crown, becomes the Poſſeſſion or Property of private Perſons, ſuch Perſons, thus holding under the Crown of England, remain or become Subjects of England to all Intents and Purpoſes, as fully as if any of the Royal Manors Foreſts or other Territory within the Realm had been granted to them upon the like Tenure. But that it is now, or was when the Plantations were firſt granted, the Prerogative of the Kings of England to alienate ſuch Territories from the Crown, or to conſtitute a Number of new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments altogether independant of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Legiſlative Authority of the Engliſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. I can by no Means concede to you. I have never ſeen any better Authority to ſupport ſuch an Opinion than an anonimous Pamphlet by which I fear you have too eaſily been miſlead, for I ſhall preſently ſhew you that the Declarations of King James the Firſt, and of King Charles the Firſt, admitting they are truly related by the Author of this Pamphlet, ought to have no Weight with you; nor does the Ceſſion or Reſtoration, upon a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Peace, of Countries which have been loſt or acquired in War militate with theſe Principles, nor may any particular Act of Power of a Prince in ſelling or delivering up any Part of His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions to a foreign Prince or State againſt the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012856_0064_0F8B9577FB2A2DE0"/>
general Senſe of the Nation be urged to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them, and upon Examination it will appear that all the Grants which have been made of America are founded upon them and are made to conform to them, even thoſe which you have adduced in Support of very different Principles.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect that, prior to what you call the firſt Grant by Q. Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh, a Grant had been made, by the ſame Princeſs, to Sir Humphrey Gilbert of all ſuch Countries as he ſhould diſcover which were to be <hi>of the Allegiance of her, her Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi> but, he dying in the Proſecution of his Voyage, a ſecond Grant was made to Sir Walter Raleigh which, you ſay, conveyed the Dominion and Sovereignty without any Reſerve of Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Executive Authority <hi>being held by Homage and a Render.</hi> To hold by <hi>Homage,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Fealty, <hi>and a Render</hi> is Deſcriptive of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage Tenure as fully as if it had been ſaid to hold <hi>as of our Manor of Eaſt Greenwich</hi> the Words in your Charter. Now this alone was a Reſerve of Dominion and Sovereignty in the Queen her Heirs and Succeſſors and, beſides this, the Grant is made upon this expreſs Condition, which you paſs over, <hi>that the People remain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Crown of England,</hi> the Head of that Legiſlative Authority which, by the Engliſh Conſtitution, is equally extenſive with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Crown throughout every Part of the Dominions. Now if we could ſuppoſe the Queen to have acquired ſeparate from her Relations to her Subjects, or in her natural Capacity, which ſhe could not do, a Title to a Country diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012856_0065_0F8B9578C479CC38"/>
by her Subjects and then to grant the ſame Country to Engliſh Subjects in her publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as Queen of England, ſtill by this Grant ſhe annexed it to the Crown. Thus by not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing between the Crown of England and the Kings and Queens of England in their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or natural Capacities, you have been led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fundamental Error which muſt prove fatal to your Syſtem. It is not material whether Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia reverted to the Crown by Sir Walter's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder or whether he never took any Benefit from his Grant, though the latter is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeeing he ceaſed from all Attempts to take Poſſeſſion of the Country after a few Years Trial. There were, undoubtedly, divers Grants made by King James the Firſt of the Continent of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica in the Beginning of the 17th Century and ſimilar to the Grant of Queen Elizabeth in this Reſpect, that they were dependant on the Crown. The Charter to the Council at Plimouth in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von dated November 3d, 1620 more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reſpects us, and of that we have the moſt authentick Remains.</p>
               <p>By this Charter, upon the Petition of Sir Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando Gorges a Corporation was conſtituted to be and continue by Succeſſion forever in the Town of Plimouth aforeſaid, to which Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Part of the American Continent which lies between the 40° and 48° Degrees of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was granted <hi>to be held of the King his Heirs and Succeſſors as of the Manor of Eaſt Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> with Powers to conſtitute ſubordinate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in America and to make Laws for ſuch Governments, <hi>not repugnant to the Laws
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012856_0066_0F8B957977973768"/>
and Statutes of England.</hi> From this Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your Predeceſſors obtained a Grant of the Soil of the Colony of Maſſachuſets-Bay, in 1627, and, in 1628, they obtained a Charter from King Charles the Firſt making them a diſtinct Corporation, alſo within the Realm, and giving them full Powers within the Limits of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; very like to thoſe of the Council of Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth throughout their more extenſive Territory.</p>
               <p>We will now conſider what muſt have been the Senſe of the King of the Nation and of the Patentees at the Time of granting theſe Patents. From the Year 1602 the Banks and Sea Coaſts of New-England had been frequented by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Subjects for catching and drying Cod-Fiſh. When an excluſive Right to the Fiſhery was claimed, by Virtue of the Patent of 1620, the Houſe of Commons was alarmed and a Bill was brought in for allowing a free Fiſhery, and it was upon this Occaſion that one of the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State declared perhaps as his own Opinion, that the Plantations were not annexed to the Crown and ſo were not within the Juriſdiction of Parliament. Sir Edwin Sandys, who was one of the Virginia Company and an eminent Lawyer, declared that he knew Virginia had been annexed and <hi>was held of the Crown as of the Manor of Eaſt Greenwich</hi> and he believed New-England was ſo alſo; and ſo it moſt certainly was. This Declaration, made by one of the King's Servants, you ſay ſhewed the Senſe of the Crown and, being not ſecretly but openly declared in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you would make it the Senſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo, notwithſtanding your own Aſſertion
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012856_0067_0F8B957A8B0BD9B0"/>
that the Lords and Commons paſſed a Bill that ſhewed their Senſe to be directly the contrary. But if there had been full Evidence of expreſs Declarations made by King James the Firſt, and King Charles the Firſt, they were Declarations contrary to their own Grants, which declare this Country to be held of the Crown and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it muſt have been annexed to it. And may not ſuch Declarations be accounted for by other Actions of thoſe Princes who when they were ſolliciting the Parliament to grant the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Tonnage and Poundage with other Aids and were, in this Way, acknowledging the Rights of Parliament, at the ſame Time were requiring the Payment of thoſe Duties with Ship Money, &amp;c. by Virtue of their Prerogative?</p>
               <p>But to remove all doubt of the Senſe of the Nation and of the Patentees of this Patent or Charter in 1620 I need only refer you to the Account publiſhed by Sir Ferdinando Gorges himſelf of the Proceedings in Parliament upon this Occaſion. As he was the moſt active Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Council of Plimouth and as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates what came within his own Knowledge and Obſervation his Narrative, which has all the Appearance of Truth and Sincerity, muſt carry Conviction with it. He ſays that ſoon after the Patent was paſſed and whilſt it lay in the Crown-Office he was ſummoned to appear in Parliament to anſwer what was to be objected againſt it, and the Houſe being in a Committee and Sir Edward Coke that great Oracle of the Law, in the Chair, he was called to the Bar and was told by Sir Edward that the Houſe underſtood that a Patent
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012856_0068_0F8B957F21F09558"/>
had been granted to the ſaid Sir <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to the Laws,</hi> and to the Privileges of the Subject, that it was a Monopoly, &amp;c. and he required the Delivery of the Patent into the Houſe. Sir Ferdinando Gorges made no Doubt of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Houſe but ſubmitted to their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the Patent as in their Wiſdom they thought good "not knowing, under Favour, how any Action of that King could be a Grievance to the Publick ſeeing it was undertaken for the Advancement of Religion, <hi>the Enlargement of the Bounds of our Nation.</hi> &amp;c. He was willing, however, to ſubmit the whole to their honorable Cenſures." After divers Attendances he imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had ſatisfied the Houſe that the planting a Colony was of much more Conſequence than a ſimple diſorderly Courſe of Fiſhing. He was, notwithſtanding, diſappointed and, when the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Grievances of the Kingdom were preſented by the two Houſes, that of the Patent for New-England was the firſt. I don't know how the Parliament could have ſhewn more fully the Senſe they then had of their Authority over this new acquired Territory, nor can we expect bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Evidence of the Senſe which the Patentees had of it, for I know of no hiſtorical Fact of which we have leſs Reaſon to doubt.</p>
               <p>And now Gentlemen I will ſhew you how it appears from our Charter itſelf, which you ſay I have not yet been pleaſed to point out to you except from that Clauſe which reſtrains us from
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012856_0069_0F8B9581541645E0"/>
making Laws repugnant to the Laws of England, that it was the Senſe of our Predeceſſors at the Time when the Charter was granted that they were to remain ſubject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Beſides this Clauſe, which I ſhall have Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion further to remark upon before I finiſh, you will find that, by the Charter a Grant was made of Exemption from all Taxes and Impoſitions upon any Goods imported <hi>into New-England,</hi> or exported from thence into England for the Space of twenty-one Years, except the Cuſtom of five per Cent upon ſuch Goods as, after the Expiration of ſeven Years, ſhould be brought into England. Nothing can be more plain than that the Charter, as well as the Patent to the Council of Plimouth, conſtitutes a Corporation in England with Powers to create a ſubordinate Government or Governments within the Plantation, ſo that there would always be Subjects of Taxes and Impoſitions both in the Kingdom and in the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. An Exemption for twenty-one Years im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Right of Impoſition after the Expiration of the Term, and there is no Diſtinction between the Kingdom and the Plantation. By what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then, in the Underſtanding of the Parties, were theſe Impoſitions to be laid? If any, to ſupport a Syſtem, ſhould ſay by the King rather than to acknowledge the Authority of Parliament, yet this could not be the Senſe of one of our principal Patentees Mr. Samuel Vaſſall who at that Inſtant, 1628, the Date of the Charter, was ſuffering the Loſs of his Goods rather than ſubmit to an Impoſition laid by the King without
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012856_0070_0F8B958259570B98"/>
the Authority of Parliament; and to prove that a few Years after it could not be the Senſe of the reſt I need only to refer you to your own Records for the Year 1642 where you will find an Order of the Houſe of Commons, conceived in ſuch Terms as diſcover a plain Reference to this Part of the Charter, after fourteen Years of the Twenty-one were expired. By this Order the Houſe of Commons declare that all Goods and Merchandize exported to New-England or imported from thence ſhall be free from all Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Impoſitions both in the Kingdom <hi>and in New-England</hi> until the Houſe ſhall take further Order therein to the contrary. The Senſe which our Predeceſſors had of the Benefit which they took from this Order evidently appears from the Vote of the General Court, acknowledging their humble Thankfulneſs, and preſerving a grateful Remembrance of the Honorable Reſpect from that high Court, and reſolving that the Order ſent unto them under the Hand of the Clerk of the Honorable Houſe of Commons ſhall be entered among their Publick Records to remain there unto Poſterity: And, in an Addreſs to Parliament, Nine Years after, they acknowledge, among other undeſerved Favours that of <hi>taking off the Cuſtoms from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am at a Loſs to know what your Ideas could be when you ſay that if the Plantations are not Part of the <hi>Realm,</hi> they are not Part of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſeeing the two Words can properly convey but one Idea and they have one and the ſame Signification in the different Languages from whence they are derived. I do not charge you
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012856_0071_0F8B9582882E3530"/>
with any Deſign, but the equivocal Uſe of the Word Realm in ſeveral Parts of your Anſwer makes them perplexed and obſcure. Sometimes, you muſt intend the whole Dominion which is ſubject to the Authority of Parliament, ſometimes only ſtrictly the Territorial Realm to which other Dominions are or may be annexed. If you mean that no Countries but the ancient territorial Realm can conſtitutionally be ſubject to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority of England, which you have very incautiouſly ſaid is a Rule of the Common Law of England, this is a Doctrine which you will never be able to ſupport. That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law ſhould be controuled and changed by Statutes every Day's Experience teaches, but that the Common Law preſcribes Limits to the Extent of the Legiſlative Power, I believe has never been ſaid upon any other Occaſion. That Acts of Parliament for ſeveral Hundred Years paſt have reſpected Countries, which are not ſtrictly within the Realm, you might eaſily have diſcovered by the Statute Books. You will find Acts for regulating the Affairs of Ireland, though a ſeperate and diſtinct Kingdom. Wales and Calais, whilſt they ſent no Repreſentatives to Parliament, were ſubject to the like Regulations. So are Guernſey, Jerſey, Alderney, &amp;c. which ſend no Members to this Day. Theſe Countries are not more properly a Part of the ancient Realm, than the Plantations, nor do I know that they can more properly be ſaid to be annexed to the Realm, unleſs the declaring that Acts of Parliament ſhall extend to Wales, though not particularly named ſhall make it ſo, which I conceive it does not in the Senſe you intend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:012856_0072_0F8B958337DC81B0"/>
Thus, I think, I have made it appear that the Plantations, though not ſtrictly within the Realm, have from the Beginning been conſtitutionally ſubject to the Supreme Authority of the Realm and are ſo far annexed to it as to be, with the Realm and the other Dependencies upon it, one intire Dominion; and that the Plantation or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of Maſſachuſetts-Bay in particular is holden as feudatory of the Imperial Crown of England: Deem it to be no Part of the Realm it is imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, for, to uſe the Words of a very great Authority in a Caſe in ſome Reſpects analogous, "being Feudatory the Concluſion neceſſary fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it is under the Government of the King's Laws and the King's Courts in Caſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for them to interpoſe, though (like Counties Palatine) it has peculiar Laws and Cuſtoms, Jura Regalia, and complete Juriſdiction at Home."</p>
               <p>Your Remark upon and Conſtruction of the Words, <hi>not Repugnant to the Laws of England,</hi> are much the ſame with thoſe of the Council; but can any Reaſon be aſſigned why the Laws of England as they ſtood juſt at that Period ſhould be pitched upon as the Standard, more than at any other Period? If ſo, why was it not recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to when the ſecond Charter was Granted, more than ſixty Years after the firſt? It is not improbable that the original Intention might be a Repugnancy in general and, a Fortiori, ſuch Laws as were made more immediately to Reſpect us, but the Statute of 7th and 8th, of King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam and Queen Mary, ſoon after the ſecond Charter, favours the latter Conſtruction only, and the Province Agent, Mr. Dummer, in his much
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012856_0073_0F8B95841CB5CAE0"/>
applauded Defence of the Charter, ſays that <hi>then</hi> a Law in the Plantations may be ſaid to be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to a Law made in Great Britain, when it flatly contradicts it ſo far as the Law made there mentions and relates to the Plantations. But, Gentlemen, there is another Clauſe both in the firſt and ſecond Charter which, I think will ſerve to explain this or to render all Diſpute upon the Conſtruction of it unneceſſary.—You are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to impoſe ſuch Oaths only as are warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by, or not repugnant to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. I believe you will not contend that theſe Clauſes muſt mean ſuch Oaths only as were warrantable at the reſpective Times when the Charters were granted. It has often been found neceſſary, ſince the Date of the Charters, to alter the Forms of the Oaths to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Acts of Parliament, and ſuch Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have always been conformed to in the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>Leſt you ſhould think that I admit the Authority of King Charles the Second in giving his Aſſent to an Act of the Aſſembly of Virginia, which you ſubjoin to the Authorities of James the Firſt and Charles the Firſt, to have any Weight, I muſt obſerve to you that I do not ſee any greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency with Magna Charta in the King's giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Aſſent to an Act of a Subordinate Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature immediately or in Perſon than when he does it mediately by his Governor or Subſtitute but, if it could be admitted that ſuch an Aſſent diſcovered the King's Judgment that Virginia was Independent, would you lay any Streſs upon it when the ſame King was from Time to Time
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012856_0074_0F8B9584B93CF440"/>
giving his Aſſent to Acts of Parliament which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Dependence of all the Colonies, and had by one of thoſe Acts declared the Plantations to be inhabited and peopled by his Majeſty Subjects of England?</p>
               <p>I gave you no Reaſon to Remark upon the Abſurdity of a Grant to Perſons born within the Realm of the ſame Liberties which would have belonged to them if they had been born within the Realm, but rather guarded againſt it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſuch Grant as declaratory only, and in the Nature of an Aſſurance that the Plantations would be conſidered as the Dominions of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But is there no Abſurdity in a Grant from the King of England of the Liberties and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Engliſhmen to Perſons born in and who are to inhabit other Territories than the Dominions of England, and would ſuch Grant, whether by Charter or other Letters Patent, be ſufficient to make them inheritable, or to intitle them to the other Liberties and Immunities of Engliſhmen, in any Part of the Engliſh Dominions?</p>
               <p>As I am willing to reſt the Point between us upon the Plantations having been, from their firſt Diſcovery and Settlement under the Crown, a Part of the Dominions of England, I ſhall not take up any Time in remarking upon your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to ſhew that ſince that Time, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have been made a Part of thoſe Dominions.</p>
               <p>The remaining Parts of your Anſwer are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended to prove that, under both Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it hath been the Senſe of the People that
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012856_0075_0F8B9588DD9CA488"/>
they were not ſubject to the Juriſdiction of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and, for this Purpoſe, you have made large Extracts from the Hiſtory of the Colony. Whilſt you are doing Honor to the Book, by laying any Streſs upon its Authority, it would have been no more than Juſtice to the Author if you had cited ſome other Paſſages which would have tended to reconcile the Paſſage, in my Speech to the Hiſtory.—I have ſaid that, except about the Time of the Anarchy which preceded the Reſtoration of King Charles the Second, I have not diſcovered that the Authority of Parliament had been called in Queſtion even by particular Perſons. It was, as I take it, from the Principles imbibed in thoſe Times of Anarchy that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Influence, mentioned in the Hiſtory, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Authority of Parliament, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would not venture to diſpute it. On the contrary, in four or five Years after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, the Government declared to the King's Commiſſioners that the Act of Navigation had been for ſome Years obſerved here, that they knew not of it's being greatly violated and that ſuch Laws as appeared to be againſt it were repealed, It is not ſtrange that theſe Perſons of Influence ſhould prevail upon great Part of the People to fall in, for a Time with their Opinions and to ſuppoſe Acts of the Colony neceſſary to give Force to Acts of Parliament; the Government, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſeveral Years before the Charter was vacated, more explicitly acknowledged the Authority of Parliament and voted that their Governor ſhould take the Oath, required of him, faithfully to do and perform all Matters and Things enjoined him by the Acts of Trade. I have not recited
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:012856_0076_0F8B958997E5DFC8"/>
in my Speech all theſe Particulars, nor had I them all in my Mind but, I think, I have ſaid nothing inconſiſtent with them. My Principles in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are ſtill the ſame with what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be in the Book you refer to, nor am I conſcious that, by any Part of my Conduct, I have given Cauſe to ſuggeſt the contrary.</p>
               <p>Inaſmuch as you ſay that I have not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pointed out to you the Acts and Doings of the General Aſſembly which relate to Acts of Parliament, I will do it now, and demonſtrate to you that ſuch Acts have been acknowledged by the Aſſembly, or ſubmitted to by the People.</p>
               <p>From your Predeceſſors Removal to America until the Year 1640 there was no Seſſion of Parliament, and the firſt ſhort Seſſion of a few Days only in 1640, and the whole of the next Seſſion, until the withdraw of the King, being taken up in the Diſputes between the King and the Parliament, there could be no Room for Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Affairs. Soon after the King's withdraw the Houſe of Commons paſſed the memorable Order of 1642, and from that Time to the Reſtoration, this Plantation ſeems to have been diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, and the ſeveral Acts or Ordinances, which reſpected the other Plantations, were never enforced here, and, poſſibly, under Colour of the Exemption in 1642, it might not be intended they ſhould be executed.</p>
               <p>For 15 or 16 Years after the Reſtoration, there was no Officer of the Cuſtoms in the Colony, except the Governor annually elected by the
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:012856_0077_0F8B958A04D847B8"/>
People, and the Acts of Trade were but little regarded, nor did the Governor take the Oath required of Governors by the Act of the 12th of King Charles the Second, until the Time which I have mentioned. Upon the Revolution the Force of an Act of Parliament was evident in a Caſe of as great Importance as any which could happen to the Colony. King William and Queen Mary were proclaimed in the Colony, King and Queen of England, France and Ireland, <hi>and the Dominions thereunto belonging,</hi> in the Room of King James, and this not by Virtue of an Act of the Colony, for no ſuch Act ever paſſed, but by Force of an Act of Parliament which altered the Succeſſion to the Crown, and for which the People waited ſeveral Weeks with anxious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. By Force of another Act of Parliament, and that only, ſuch Officers of the Colony as had taken the Oaths of Allegiance to King James deemed themſelves at Liberty to take, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did take the Oaths to King William and Queen Mary. And that I may mention other Acts of the like Nature together, it is by Force of an Act of Parliament that the Illuſtrious Houſe of Hanover ſucceeded to the Throne of Britain <hi>and its Dominions,</hi> and by ſeveral other Acts, the Forms of the Oaths have from Time to Time, been altered, and by a late Act that Form was eſtabliſhed which every one of us has complied with as the Charter in expreſs Words requires and makes our Duty. Shall we now diſpute whether Acts of Parliament have been ſubmitted to when we find them ſubmitted to in Points which are of the very Eſſence of our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If you ſhould diſown that Authority which
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:012856_0078_0F8B958AC157B448"/>
has Power even to change the Succeſſion to the Crown, are you in no Danger of denying the Authority of our moſt gracious Sovereign, which I am ſure none of you can have in your Thoughts?</p>
               <p>I think I have before ſhewn you, Gentlemen, what muſt have been the Senſe of our Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors at the Time of the firſt Charter, let us now, whilſt we are upon the Acts and Doings of the Aſſembly, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>er what it muſt have been at the Time of the ſecond Charter. Upon the firſt Advice of the Revolution in England, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which aſſumed the Government inſtructed their Agents to petition <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Parliament</hi> to reſtore the firſt Charter, and a Bill for that Purpoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Houſe of Commons, but went no farther. Was not this owning <hi>the Authority of Parliament?</hi> By an Act of Parliament, paſſed in the firſt Year of King William and Queen Mary, a Form of Oaths was eſtabliſhed to be taken by thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and by all ſucceeding Kings and Queens of of England at their Coronation, the firſt of which is, that they will govern the People of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>and the Dominions thereunto belonging, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statutes in Parliament agreed on, and the Laws and Cuſtoms of the ſame.</hi> When the Colony directed their Agents to make their humble Application to King William to grant the ſecond Charter, they could have no other Pretence than as they were Inhabitants of Part <hi>of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of England,</hi> and they alſo knew the Oath the King had taken to govern them <hi>according to the Statutes in Parliament;</hi> ſurely then, at the Time of this Charter alſo, it was the Senſe of our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, as well as of the King and of the Nation
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012856_0079_0F8B958BE61A3238"/>
that there was and would remain a Supremacy in the Parliament. About the ſame Time, they acknowledge, in an Addreſs to the King, that they have no Power to make Laws <hi>repugnant to the Laws of England.</hi> And, immediately after the Aſſumption of the Powers of Government by Virtue of the new Charter, an Act paſſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive for a limitted Time all the Local Laws of the Colonies of Maſſachuſetts-Bay and New-Plimouth, reſpectively, <hi>not repugnant to the Laws of England.</hi> And, at the ſame Seſſion, an Act paſſed eſtabliſhing Naval Officers in ſeveral Ports of the Province, for which this Reaſon is given, <hi>that all undue Trading contrary to an Act of Parliament made in the 15th Year of King Charles the Second may be prevented in this their Majeſty's Province.</hi> The Act of this Province paſſed ſo long ago as the ſecond Year of King George the firſt, for ſtating the Fees of the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers, muſt have relation to the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by which they are conſtituted, and the Proviſion made in that Act of the Province for extending the Port of Boſton to all the Roads as far as Cape-Aod, could be for no other Purpoſe than for the more effectual carrying the Acts of Trade into Execution. And, to come nearer to the preſent Time, when an Act of Parliament had paſſed in 1741, for putting an End to certain unwarrantable Schemes in this Province, did the Authority of Government, or thoſe Perſons more immediately affected by it, ever diſpute the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of it? On the contrary, have not a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Acts been paſſed in the Province, that the Burdens to which ſuch Perſons were ſubjected might be equally apportioned, and have not all
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:012856_0080_0F8B958C607C6800"/>
thoſe Acts of the Province been very carefully framed to prevent their militating with the Act of Parliament? I will mention alſo an Act of Parliament made in the firſt Year of Queen Ann; altho' the Proceedings upon it more immediately reſpected the Council. By this Act no Office Civil or Military ſhall be void by the Death of the King, but ſhall continue ſix Months, unleſs ſuſpended or made void by the next Succeſſor. By Force of this Act, Governor Dudley conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Adminiſtration ſix Months from the Demiſe of Queen Ann, and immediately after, the Council aſſumed the Adminiſtration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it until a Proclamation arrived from King George, by Virtue of which Governor Dudley reaſſumed the Government. It would be tedious to enumerate the Addreſſes, Votes and Meſſages of both the Council and Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives to the ſame Purpoſe. I have ſaid enough to ſhew that this Government has ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Parliament from a Conviction of it's conſtitutional Supremacy, and this not <hi>from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration, nor meerly from Reluctance at the Idea of contending with the Parent State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then I have made it appear, that both by the firſt and ſecond Charters we hold our Lands and the Authority of Government not of the <hi>King</hi> but of the <hi>Crown</hi> of England, that being a Dominion of the Crown of England, we are conſequently ſubject to the Supreme Authority of England, that this hath been the Senſe of this Plantation, except in thoſe few Years when the Principles of Anarchy which had prevailed in the Kingdom had not loſt their Influence here; and
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:012856_0081_0F8B9592F765AFB8"/>
if, upon a Review of your Principles, they ſhall appear to you to have been deluſive and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as I think they muſt, or if you ſhall only be in Doubt of them, you certainly will not draw that Concluſion which otherwiſe you might do, and which I am glad you have hitherto avoided; eſpecially when you conſider the obvious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Diſtreſs and Miſery of Independence upon our Mother Country, if ſuch Independence could be allowed or maintained, and the Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of much greater Diſtreſs, which we are not able to foreſee.</p>
               <p>You aſk me if we have not Reaſon to fear we ſhall ſoon be reduced to a worſe Situation than that of the Colonies of France, Spain or Holland. I may ſafely affirm that we have not; that we have no Reaſon to Fear any Evils from a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Authority of Parliament, equal to what we muſt feel from its Authority being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, from an uncertain Rule of Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For more than ſeventy Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Supremacy of Parliament was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged without Complaints of Grievance. The Effect of every Meaſure cannot be foreſeen by human Wiſdom. What can be expected more from any Authority than when the Unfitneſs of a Meaſure is diſcovered, to make it void? When upon the united Repreſentations and Complaints of the American Colonies any Acts have appeared to Parliament to be unſalutary, have there not been repeated Inſtances of the Repeal of ſuch Acts? We cannot expect theſe Inſtances ſhould be carried ſo far as to be equivalent to a Diſavowal or Relinquiſhment of the Right itſelf. Why then
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:012856_0082_0F8B9593C11271D0"/>
ſhall we fear for ourſelves and our Poſterity, greater rigour of Government for ſeventy Years to come than what we and our Predeceſſors have felt in the ſeventy Years paſt.</p>
               <p>You muſt give me Leave, Gentlemen, in a few Words to vindicate myſelf from a Charge, in one Part of your Anſwer, of having, by my Speech, reduced you to the unhappy Alternative of appearing by your Silence to acquieſce in my Sentiments, or of freely diſcuſſing this Point of the Supremacy of Parliament. I ſaw, as I have before obſerved, the Capital Town of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, without being reduced to ſuch an Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, voluntarily not only diſcuſſing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining this Point, and inviting every other Town and Diſtrict in the Province to do the like. I ſaw that many of the principal Towns had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Example, and that there was imminent Danger of a Compliance in moſt if not all the Reſt, in Order to avoid being diſtinguiſhed. Was not I reduced to the Alternative of rendering myſelf juſtly obnoxious to the Diſpleaſure of my Sovereign by acquieſcing in ſuch Irregularities, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Might I not rather have expected from you an Expreſſion of your Concern that any Perſons ſhould project and proſecute a Plan of Meaſures which would lay me under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of bringing this Point before you?

We have already offered Reaſons, in which your Excellency ſeems to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce, to ſhew that, though the Term <hi>Supreme</hi> ſometimes carries with it the Idea of <hi>unlimitted</hi> Authority, it cannot, in that Senſe, be applied to that which is human. What is uſually denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:012856_0085_0F8B9595FB6A24E0"/>
the Supreme Authority of a Nation muſt nevertheleſs be limitted in it's Acts to the Objects that are properly or c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſtitutionally cognizable by it. To illuſtrate our Meaning, we beg Leave to quote a Paſſage from your Speech, at the Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Seſſion, where your Excellency ſays, "ſo much of the Spirit of Liberty breathes through all Parts of the Engliſh Conſtitution, that although from the Nature of Government there muſt be one Supreme Authority over the whole, yet this Conſtitution will admit of Subordinate Powers with Legiſlative and Executive Authoriy, greater or leſs, according to Local and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances."—This is very true, and implies, that the Legiſlative and Executive Authority granted to the Subordinate Powers ſhould extend and operate as far as the Grant allows; and that, if it does not exceed the Limits preſcribed to it, and no Forfeiture be incurred, the Supreme Power has no rightful Authority to take away or diminiſh it, or to ſubſtitute its own Acts of Caſes wherein the Acts of the Subordinate Power can, according to its Conſtitution, operate. To ſuppoſe the contrary is to ſuppoſe, that it has no Property in the Privileges granted to it, for if it holds them at the Will of the Supreme Power, which it muſt do by the above Suppoſition, it can have no Property in them: upon which Principle, which involves the Contradiction, that what is granted is in Reality not granted, no Subordinate Power can exiſt. But as in Fact the two Powers are not incompatible, and do ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt together, each reſtraining its Acts to their Conſtitutional Objects, can we not from hence ſee how the Supreme Power may ſuperviſe, regulate, and make general
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:012856_0086_0F8B9596B83C6C60"/>
Laws for the Kingdom, without interfering with the Privileges of the Subordinate Powers within it? And alſo ſee how it may extend its Care and Protection to its Colonies, without injuring their Conſtitutional Rights?—What has been here ſaid concerning Supreme Authority has no Reference to the Manner in which it has been in Fact ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, but is wholly confined to its general Nature; and if it conveys any juſt Idea of it, the Inferences that have been at any Time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from it, injurious to the Rights of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts, are not well founded; and have proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ariſen from a Miſconception of the Nature of that Authority.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency repreſents us as introducing a Number of Authorities merely to ſhew, that "all Taxes upon Engliſh Subjects muſt be levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Virtue of the Act, not of the King alone, but in Conjunction with the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons." and are pleaſed to add, that "you ſhould very readily have allowed it; and you ſhould as readily have allowed, that all other Acts of Legiſlation muſt be paſſed by the ſame joint Authority, and not by the King alone."—Your Excellency "would have ſaved us the Trouble of all thoſe Authorities:" and on our Part we ſhould have been as willing to have ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Excellency the Trouble of diſmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Argument, and from thence taking Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to repreſent it in a diſadvantageous Light, or rather totally deſtroying it.</p>
            <p>In Juſtice to ourſelves it is neceſſary to Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate that Argument adduced to prove, that
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:012856_0087_0F8B95977727F308"/>
the Inhabitants of this Province are not conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally ſubject to Parliamentary Taxation. In order thereto we recurred to Magna Charta and other Authorities. And the Argument abridged ſtands thus—That from thoſe Authorities it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears an Eſſential Part of the Engliſh Conſtitution, "that no Tallage, or Aid, or Tax, ſhall be laid or levied, without the Good-will and Aſſent of the Freemen of the Commonalty of the Realm." That from Common Law, and the Province Charter, the Inhabitants of this Province are clearly intitled to all the Rights of free and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subjects within the Realm: That among thoſe Rights muſt be included the eſſential one juſt mentioned concerning Aids and Taxes; and therefore that no Aids or Taxes can be levied on us conſtitutionally without our own Conſent ſignified by our Repreſentatives. From whence the Concluſion is clear, that therefore the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this Province are not conſtitutionally ſubject to Parliamentary Taxation.</p>
            <p>We did not bring thoſe Authorities to ſhew that Tax Acts, or any other Acts of Parliament, in order to their Validity, muſt have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the King, Lords, and Commons; but to ſhew, that it has been, at leaſt from the Time of Magna Charta, an eſſential Right of free Subjects within the Realm, to be free from all Taxes but ſuch as were laid with their own Conſent. And it was proper to ſhew this, as the Rights and Liberties, granted by the Province Charter, were to be equally extenſive, to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and Purpoſes, with thoſe enjoyed by free and natural Subjects within the Realm. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:012856_0088_0F8B959B8A409A70"/>
to ſhew our own Rights in Relation to Taxes, it was neceſſary to ſhew the Rights of Freemen within the Realm, in Relation to them: and for this Purpoſe thoſe Authorities were brought, and not impertinently, as we humbly apprehend. Nor have we ſeen Reaſon to change our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents with Reſpect to this Matter or any other contained in our Anſwer to your Excellency's Speech.</p>
            <p>In the laſt Clauſe of your Speech, your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency informs the two Houſes, "you are Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to ſay, that his Majeſty will moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly approve of every Conſtitutional Meaſure, that may contribute to the Peace, the Happineſs and Proſperity of his Colony of Maſſachuſetts-Bay."—We have the higheſt Senſe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Goodneſs in his gracious Diſpoſition to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of ſuch Meaſures, which, as it includes his Approbation of the Conſtitutional Rights of his Subjects of this Colony, manifeſts his Inclination to protect them in thoſe Rights; and to remove the Incroachments that have been made upon them. Of this Act of Royal Goodneſs they are not wholly unworthy, as in Regard to Loyalty, Duty and Affection to his Majeſty, they ſtand among the foremoſt of his faithful Subjects.</p>

            <p>IN your Speech at the Opening of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Seſſion, your Excellency expreſs'd your Diſpleaſure at ſome late Proceedings of the Town of Boſton, and other principal Towns in the Province. And in another Speech to both Houſes we have your repeated Exceptions at the ſame Proceedings as being "unwarrantable," and of a dangerous Nature and Tendency; "againſt which you thought yourſelf bound to call upon us to join with you in bearing a proper Teſtimony." This Houſe have not diſcovered any Principles advanced by the Town of Boſton, that are unwarrantable by the Conſtitution; nor does it appear to us that they have "invited every other Town and Diſtrict in the Province to adopt their Principles." We are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it is our Duty to bear our Teſtimony againſt "Innovations of a dangerous Nature and Tendency:" But is clearly our Opinion, that it is the indiſputable Right of all or any of his Majeſty's Subjects in this Province, regularly and orderly to meet together to ſtate the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances they labor under; and to propoſe and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:012856_0090_0F8B959ED0275C58"/>
unite in ſuch conſtitutional Meaſures as they ſhall judge neceſſary or proper to obtain Redreſs. This Right has been frequently exerciſed by his Majeſty's Subjects within the Realm; and we do not recollect an Inſtance, ſince the happy Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, when the two Houſes of Parliament have been called upon to diſcountenance or bear their Teſtimony againſt it, in a Speech from the Throne.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency is pleaſed to take Notice of ſome things which we "alledge" in our Anſwer to your firſt Speech; and the Obſervation you make, we muſt confeſs, is as natural and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably true, as any one that could have been made, that "if our Foundation ſhall fail us <hi>in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Part of it,</hi> the Fabrick we have rais'd upon it, muſt certainly fall." You think, this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation will fail us; but we wiſh your Excellency has condeſended to a Conſideration of what we have "a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>duced in Support of our Principles." We might then perhaps have had ſome things offered for our Conviction, more than bare Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations; which, we muſt beg to be excuſed if we ſay, are far from being ſufficient, though they came with your Excellency's Authority, for which however we have a due Regard.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency ſays that "as Engliſh Subjects and agreeable to the Doctrine of the Feudal Tenure all our Lands are held mediately or immediately of the Crown." We truſt your Excellency does not mean to introduce the Feudal Syſtem in it's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which to uſe the Words of one of our greateſt Hiſtorians, was "a State of perpetual
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:012856_0091_0F8B959EF671ED60"/>
War, Anarchy and Confuſion; calculated ſolely for Defence againſt the Aſſaults of any foreign Power, but in it's Proviſion for the interior Order and Tranquility of Society extremely defective." "A Conſtitution ſo contradictory to all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that govern Mankind, could never be brought about but by foreign Conqueſt or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Uſurpation:" And a very celebrated Writer calls it "that moſt iniquitous and abſurd Form of Government by which human Nature was ſo ſhamefully degraded." This Syſtem of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity by a ſtrange Kind of Fatality, "though originally form'd for an Encampment and for Military Purpoſes only, ſpread over a great Part of Europe:" and to ſerve the Purpoſes of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Tyranny "was adopted by Princes and wrought into their Civil Conſtitutions;" and aided by the Canon Law, calculated by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pontiff, to exalt himſelf above all that is called God, it prevailed to the almoſt utter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Knowledge, Virtue, Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from that Part of the Earth. But from the Time of the Reformation, in Proportion as Knowledge, which then darted its Rays upon the benighted World, increas'd and ſpread among the People, they grew impatient under this heavy Yoke: And the moſt virtuous and ſenſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, to whoſe Stedfaſtneſs we in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Age and Climate are greatly indebted, were determined to get rid of it: And tho' they have in a great Meaſure ſubdued it's Power and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in England, they have never yet totally eradicated its Principles.</p>

               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:012856_0092_0F8B959FC4112340"/>
Upon theſe Principles the King claimed an abſolute Right to and a perfect Eſtate in all the Lands within his Dominions; but how he came by this abſolute Right and perfect Eſtate is a Myſtery which we have never ſeen unravelled, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>e granted Parts of Parcels of it to his Friends the Great Men, and they granted leſſer Parcels to their Tenants: All therefore derived their Right and held their Lands, upon theſe Principles, mediately or immediately of the King; which Mr. <hi>Blackſtone</hi> however calls "in Reality a meey Fiction of our Engliſh Tenures."</p>
            <p>By what Right in Nature and Reaſon the Chriſtian Princes in Europe claimed the Lands of Heathen People, upon a Diſcovery made by any of their Subjects, is equally myſterious: Such however was the Doctrine univerſally prevailing when the Lands in America were diſcovered; but as the People of England upon thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples held all the Lands they poſſeſſed by Grants from the King, and the King had never granted the Lands in America <hi>to them,</hi> it is certain they could have no Sort of Claim to them: Upon the Principles advanced, the Lordſhip and Dominion like that of the Lands in England, was in the King ſolely: and a Right from thence accrued to him of diſpoſing ſuch Territories under ſuch Tenure and for ſuch Servies to be performed, as the King or Lord thought proper. But how the Grantees <hi>became</hi> Subjects of England, that is the Supreme Authority of the Parliament, your Excellency has not explained to us. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that upon the Feudal Principles all Power
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:012856_0093_0F8B95A07ACA56B8"/>
is in the King; they afford us no Idea <hi>of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> "The Lord was in early Times the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator and Judge over all his Feudatories," ſays Judge Blackſtone. By the Struggles for Liberty in England from the Days of King John to the laſt happy Revolution, the Conſtitution has been gradually changing for the better; and upon the more rational Principles that all Men by Nature are in a State of Equality in Reſpect of Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Dominion, Power in England has been more equally divided. And thus alſo in America, though we hold our Lands agreeably to the Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Principles of the King; yet our Predeceſſors wiſely took care to enter into Compact with the King that Power here ſhould alſo be equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded agreeable to the original fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Engliſh Conſtitution, declared in Magna Charter, and other Laws and Statutes of England, made to confirm them.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency ſays, "you can by no Means concede to us that it is now or was when the Plantations were firſt granted the Prerogative of the Kings of England to conſtitute a Number of new Governments altogether independent of the Sovereign Authority of the Engliſh Empire." By the Feudal Principles upon which you ſay "all the Grants which have been made of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica are founded" "the Conſtitutions of the Emperor have the Force of Law." If our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be conſidered as merely Feudatory, we are ſubject to the King's abſolute Will, and there is no Room for the Authority of Parliament, as the Sovereign Authority of the Britiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Upon theſe Principles, what could hinder
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012856_0094_0F8B95A1371C3B08"/>
the King's conſtituting a Number of independent Governments in America? That King Charles the Firſt did actually ſet up a Government in this Colony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conceding to it Powers of making and executing Laws, without any Reſervation to the Engliſh Parliament, of Authority to make future Laws binding therein, is a Fact which your Excellency has not diſproved if you have denied it. Nor have you ſhewn that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or Nation objected to it, from whence we have inferred that it was an acknowledged Right. And we cannot conceive, why the King has not the ſame Right to alienate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Countries acquired by the Diſcovery of his Subjects, as he has to "reſtore upon a Treaty of Peace Countries which have been acquired in War," carried on at the Charge of the Nation; or to "ſell and deliver up any Part of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions to a foreign Prince or State, againſt the General Senſe of the Nation" which is "an Act of Power" or Prerogative which your Excellency allows. You tell us that "when any New Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are diſcovered by Engliſh Subjects, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the general Law and Uſage of Nations, <hi>they become Part of the State.</hi>" The Law of Nations is or ought to be founded on the Law or Reaſon. It was the Saying of Sir Edwin Sandis, in the great Caſe of the Union of the Realm of Scotland with England, which is applicable to our preſent Purpoſe, that "there being no Precedent for this Caſe in the Law, the Law is deficient; and the Law being deficient, Recourſe is to be had to Cuſtom; and Cuſtom being inſufficient, we muſt recur to natural Reaſon," the greateſt of all Authorities, which he adds "is the Law
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:012856_0095_0F8B95A202D7E7C0"/>
of Nations." The Opinions therefore, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the greateſt Sages and Judges of the Law in the Exchequer Chamber ought not to be conſidered as deciſive or binding in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Controverſy with your Excellency, any further than they are conſonant to <hi>natural Reaſon.</hi> If however we were to recur to ſuch Opinions and Determinations we ſhould find very great Authorities in our Favour, to ſhow that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of England are not binding on thoſe who are not repreſented in Parliament there. The Opinion of Lord Coke that Ireland was bound by Statutes of England wherein they <hi>were named,</hi> if compared with his other Writings, appears manifeſtly to be grounded upon a Suppoſition, that Ireland had by an Act of their own, in the Reign of King John, conſented to be thus bound, and upon any other Suppoſition this Opinion would be againſt <hi>Reaſon;</hi> for <hi>Conſent only</hi> gives human Laws their Force. We beg Leave, upon what your Excellency has obſerved of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny becoming a Part of the State, to ſubjoin the Opinions of ſeveral learned Civilians, as quoted by a very able Lawyer in this Country; "Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſays Puffendorf, are ſettled in different Methods. For either the Colony <hi>continues a Part</hi> of the Common Wealth it was ſet out from; or elſe is obliged to pay a dutiful Regard to the Mother Common Wealth, and to be in Readineſs to defend and vindicate its Honor, and ſo is united by a Sort of unequal Confederacy; or laſtly, is <hi>erected into a ſeperate Common Wealth</hi> and <hi>aſſumes the ſame Rights,</hi> with the State it deſcended from." And King Tullius, as quoted by the ſame learned Author
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012856_0096_0F8B95A43A5040D0"/>
from Grotius, ſays "We look upon it to be neither Truth nor Juſtice that Mother Cities ought of Neceſſity and <hi>by the Law of Nature</hi> to <hi>rule over the Colonies.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Your Excellency has miſinterpreted what we have ſaid, "that no Country by the Common Law, was ſubject to the Laws or the Parliament but the Realm of England," and are pleaſed to tell us that we have expreſſed ourſelves <hi>"Incautiouſly."</hi> We beg Leave to recite the Words of the Judges of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the before mentioned Caſe to our Purpoſe. "If a King go out of England with a Company of his Servants, Allegiance remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th among his Subjects and Servants, altho' he be out of his Realm <hi>whereto his Laws are confined,</hi>" We did not mean to ſay, as your Excellency would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that "the Common Law preſcribes Limits to the Extent of the Legiſlative Power," though we ſhall always affirm it to be true of the Law of Reaſon and natural Equity. Your Excellency thinks you have made it appear, that the Colony of Maſſachuſetts-Bay is holden as feudatory of the Imperial Crown of England;" and therefore you ſay, "to uſe the Words of a very great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in a Caſe in <hi>ſome Reſpects</hi> analogous to it," being feudatory it neceſſarily follows, that it is under the Government of the King's Laws." Your Excellency has not named this Authority: but we conceive his Meaning muſt be, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Feudatory, it is under the Government of the King's Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>abſolutely;</hi> for as we have before ſaid the Feudal Syſtem admits of no Idea of the Authority of Parliament, and this would have
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012856_0097_0F8B95A46A8B8290"/>
been the Caſe of the Colony but for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with the King in the Charter.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency ſays, that "Perſons thus hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>under the Crown</hi> of England remain or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> Subjects of England;" by which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your Excellency to mean, ſubject to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority of Parliament "to all Intents and Purpoſes as fully as if any of the Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, &amp;c. within the Realm had been Granted to them upon the like Tenure." We apprehend with Submiſſion, your Excellency is Miſtaken in ſuppoſing that our Allegiance is due to the Crown of England. Every Man ſwears Allegiance for himſelf to his own King in his Natural Perſon. "Every Subject is preſumed by Law to be Sworn to the King, which is to his Natural Perſon," ſays Lord Coke. <hi>Rep. on Calvins Caſe.</hi> "The Allegiance is due to his Natural Body." And he ſays "in the Reign of Edward II. the Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the Father and the Son, to cover the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hatched in their Hearts, invented this dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and damned Opinion, that <hi>Homage</hi> and Oath of Allegiance was more by Reaſon of the King's Crown, that is of his politick Capacity, than by Reaſon of the Perſon of the King; upon which Opinion they infer'd execrable and deteſtable Conſequents." The Judges of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, all but one, in the Caſe of the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Scotland and England, declared that "Allegiance fol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oweth the natural Perſon not the politick;" and "to prove the Allegiance to be tied to the Body natural of the King, and not to the Body politick, the Lord Coke cited the Phraſes of diverſe Statutes, mentioning our
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:012856_0098_0F8B95A4F63C9520"/>
               <hi>natural</hi> liege Sovereign."—If then the Homage and Allegiance is not to the Body politick of the King, then it is not to him as the Head or any Part of that Legiſlative Authority, which your Excellency ſays "is equally extenſive with the Authority of the Crown throughout every Part of the Dominion;" and your Excellency's Obſervations thereupon muſt fail. The ſame Judges mention the Allegiance of a Subject to the Kings of England who is out of the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England; which is perfectly reconcil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able with the Principles of our Anceſtors quoted before from your Excellency's Hiſtory, but upon your Excellency's Principles appears to us to be an Abſurdity. The Judges, ſpeaking of a Subject, ſay, "although his Birth was out of the Bounds of the Kingdom of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and <hi>out of the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England,</hi> yet if it were <hi>within the Allegiance of the King of England,</hi> &amp;c. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, Acquitain, Gaſcoign, and other Places within the Limits of France, and conſequently out of the Realm or Bounds of the Kingdom of England, were in Subjection to the Kings of England. And the Judges ſay, "<hi>Rex et Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> be not ſo Relatives, as a King can be King but of one Kingdom, which clearly hold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th not but that his Kingly Power extending to divers Nations and Kingdoms, all owe him equal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and are equally born to the Benefit of his Protection, and altho' he is to govern them <hi>by their diſtinct Laws,</hi> yet any one of the People coming into the other is to have the Benefit of the Laws whereſoever he cometh." So they are not to be deemed Aliens, as your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012856_0099_0F8B93F9C8A6BCA8"/>
in your Speech ſuppoſes in any of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; all which accords with the Principles our Anceſtors held. "And he is to bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Burden of Taxes of the <hi>Place where he cometh,</hi> but living in one or for his Livelihood in one, <hi>he is not to be taxed in the other,</hi> becauſe Laws ordain Taxes, Impoſitions and Charges as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Subjection particularized to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nation;" Nothing we think can be more clear to our Purpoſe than this Deciſion, of Judges, perhaps as learned as ever adorned the Engliſh Nation; or in Favor of America in her preſent Controverſy with the Mother State.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency ſays, that by our not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We have ſaid that our Anceſtors conſidered the Land which they took Poſſeſſion of in America as out of the Bounds of the Kingdom of England, and out of the Reach and Extent of the Laws of England; and that the King alſo even in the Act of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Charter, conſidered the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ſuppoſed it was acquired by neither; and therefore they declared, as we have before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from your Hiſtory, that ſaving their actual Purchaſe from the Natives, of the Soil, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, the Lordſhip, and Sovereignty, they had in the Sight of God and Man, no Right and Title to what they poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="unknown:012856_0101_0F8B93FB02AE0130"/>
the Secretaries of State declared that the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were not annexed to the Crown, and ſo were not within the Juriſdiction of Parliament." If we ſhould concede to what your Excellency ſuppoſes might poſſibly or "perhaps" be the Caſe, that the Secretary made this Declaration "as his own Opinion," the Event ſhowed that it was the Opinion of the King too; for it is not to be accounted for upon any other Principle, that he would have denied his Royal Aſſent to a Bill formed for no other Purpoſe, but to grant his Subjects in England the Privilege of Fiſhing on the Sea Coaſts in America. The Account publiſhed by Sir Ferdinando Gorges himſelf, of the Proceedings of Parliament <hi>on this Occaſion,</hi> your Excellency thinks will remove all Doubt of the Senſe of the Nation and of the Patentees of this Patent or Charter in 1620. "This Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, you ſay, has all the Appearance of Truth and Sincerity," which we do not deny: And to us it carries this Conviction with it, that "what was objected" in Parliament was, the excluſive Claim of Fiſhing only. His imagining that he had ſatisfied the Houſe after divers Attendances, that the Planting a Colony was of much more Conſequence than a <hi>ſimple diſorderly Courſe of Fiſhing,</hi> is ſufficient for our Conviction. We know that the Nation was at that Time alarmed with Apprehenſions of Monopolies; and if the Patent of New-England was preſented by the two Houſes as a Grievance, it did not ſhow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as your Excellency ſuppoſes, "the Senſe they then had of their Authority over this new-acquired Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory," but only their Senſe of the Grievance of a Monopoly of the Sea.</p>

We are happy to hear your Excellency ſay, that "our Remarks upon and Conſtruction of the Words <hi>not repugnant to the Laws of England,</hi> are much the ſame with thoſe of the Council." It ſerves to confirm us in our Opinion, in what we take to be the moſt important Matter of Difference between your Excellency and the two Houſes. After ſaying, that the Statute of 7th and 8th of William and Mary favors the Conſtruction of the Words as intending ſuch Laws of England as are made more immediately to reſpect us, you tell us, that "the Province Agent Mr. Dummer in his much applauded Defence, ſays that <hi>then</hi> a Law of the Plantations may be ſaid to be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to a Law made in Great-Britain, when it flatly contradicts it ſo far as the Law made there mentions and relates to the Plantations." This is plain and obvious to common Senſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be denied. But if your Excellency will read a Page or two further in that excellent Defence, you will ſee that he mentions this as the Senſe of the Phraſe, as taken from an Act of Parliament, rather than as the Senſe he would chuſe himſelf to put upon it; and he expreſly deſigns to ſhew, in Vindication of the Charter, that in that Senſe of the Words, there never was a Law made in the Plantations repugnant to the Laws of Great-Britain. He gives another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction much more likely to be the true Intent of the Words; namely, "that the Patentees ſhall not preſume under Colour of their particular Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to make any Laws <hi>inconſiſtent with the Great Charter and other Laws of England, by which the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are ſecure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>" This is the Senſe in which
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012856_0103_0F8B94022C723068"/>
our Anceſtors underſtood the Words; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were unwilling to conform to the Acts of Trade, and diſregarded them till they made Proviſion to give them Force in the Colony by a Law of their own; ſaying, that "the Laws of England did not reach America: And thoſe Acts were an Invaſion of their Rights, Liberties and Properties," becauſe they were not "repreſented in Parliament." The Right of being governed only by Laws which were made by Perſons in whoſe Election they had a Voice, they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Foundation of Engliſh Liberties. By the Compact with the King in the Charter, they were to be as free in America, as they would have been if they had remained within the Realm; and therefore they freely aſſerted that they "were to be governed by Laws made by themſelves and by Officers choſen by themſelves." Mr. Dummer ſays, "It ſeems reaſonable enough to think that the Crown," and he might have added our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, "intended by this Injunction to provide for all its Subjects, that they might not be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by Arbitrary Power—but—being ſtill Subjects, they ſhould be protected by the ſame mild Laws and enjoy the ſame happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as if they continued within the Realm." And conſidering the Words of the Charter in this Light, he looks upon them as deſigned to be a Fence againſt Oppreſſion and deſpotic Power. But the Conſtruction which your Excellency puts upon the Words, reduces us to a State of Vaſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and expoſes us to Oppreſſion and deſpotic Power, whenever a Parliament ſhall ſee fit to make Laws for that Purpoſe and put them in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>

We flatter ourſelves that from the large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts we have made from your Excellency's Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Colony, it appears evidently, that under both Charters it hath been the Senſe of the People and of the Government that they were not under the Juriſdiction of Parliament. We pray you again to recur to thoſe Quotations and our Obſervations upon them: And we wiſh to have your Excellency's judicious Remarks. When we adduced that Hiſtory to prove that the Sentiments of <hi>private</hi> Perſons of Influence, four or five Years after the Reſtoration, were very different from what your Excellency apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be when you delivered your Speech, you ſeem to concede to it by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We find in the ſame Hiſtory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Quotation from a Letter of Mr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> dated 17 Years after the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, mentioning "the Country's not taking Notice of the Acts of Navigation <hi>to obſerve them.</hi>" And it was, as we take it, after that Time, that the Government declared in a Letter to their Agents, that they had not ſubmitted to them; and they ventured to "diſpute" the Juriſdiction, aſſerting that they apprehended the Acts to be an Invaſion of the Rights, Liberties and Properties of the Subjects of his Majeſty in the Colony, <hi>they not being repreſented in Parliament;</hi> and that "the Laws of England <hi>did not reach America.</hi>" It very little avails in Proof that they conceded to the Supreme Authority of Parliament, their
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012856_0105_0F8B940340B88E18"/>
telling the Commiſſioners "that the Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation had for ſome Years before been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, that they knew not of its being greatly violated, and that ſuch Laws as appeared to be againſt it were repealed." It may as truly be ſaid now, that the Revenue Acts are obſerved by ſome of the People of this Province; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that the Government and People of this Province have conceded that the Parliament had Authority to make ſuch Acts to be obſerved here. Neither does their Declarations to the Commiſſioners that ſuch Laws as appeared to be againſt the Act of Navigation were repealed, prove their Conceſſion of the Authority of Parliament, by any means ſo much as their making Proviſion for giving Force to an Act of Parliament within this Province, by a deliberate and ſolemn Act or Law of their own, proves the contrary.</p>
            <p>You tell us, that "the Government four or five Years before the Charter was vacated more explicitly," that is than by a Converſation with the Commiſſioners, "acknowledged the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament, and voted that their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſhould take the Oath required of him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to do and perform all Matters and Things enjoined him by the Acts of Trade." But does this, may it pleaſe your Excellency, ſhow their explicit Acknowledgment of the Authority of Parliament? Does it not rather ſhow directly the contrary: For, what need could there be for their Vote or Authority to require him to take the Oath already required of him by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct of Parliament, unleſs both he and they judged that an Act of Parliament was not of Force ſufficient
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:012856_0106_0F8B9403F9A7A0D8"/>
to bind him to take ſuch Oath? We do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but on the contrary are fully perſuaded that your Excellency's Principles in Government are ſtill of the ſame with what they appear to be in the Hiſtory; for you there ſay, that "the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Law plainly ſhows the wrong Senſe they had of the Relation they ſtood in to England." But we are from hence convinced that your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency when you wrote the Hiſtory was of our Mind in this Reſpect, that our Anceſtors in paſſing the Law diſcovered their Opinion that they were without the Juriſdiction of Parliament: For it was upon this Principle alone that they ſhewed the wrong Senſe they had in your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's Opinion, of the Relation they ſtood in to England.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency in your ſecond Speech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to point out to us the Acts and Doings of the General Aſſembly which relates to Acts of Parliament, which you think "demonſtrates that they have been acknowledged by the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or ſubmitted to by the People:" Neither of which in our Opinion ſhows that it was the Senſe of the Nation, and our Predeceſſors when they firſt took Poſſeſſion of this Plantation or Colony by a Grant and Charter from the Crown, that they were to remain ſubject to the ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Engliſh Parliament.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency ſeems chiefly to rely upon our Anceſtors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after the Revolution "proclaiming King William and Queen Mary in the Room o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="unknown:012856_0107_0F8B9404C5815128"/>
Time to Time," and finally "the Ebabliſhment of the Form which every one of us has complied with, as the Charter in expreſs Terms requires and makes our Duty." We do not know that it has ever been a Point in Diſpute whether the Kings of England were ipſo facto Kings in and over this Colony or Province. The Compact was made between King Charles the Firſt, his Heirs and Succeſſors, and the Governor and Company, their Heirs and Succeſſors. It is eaſy upon this Principle to account for the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of and Submiſſion to King William and Queen Mary as Succeſſors of Charles the Firſt, in the Room of King James: Beſides it is to be conſidered, that the People in the Colony as well as in England had ſuffered under the TYRANT James, by which he had alike for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his Right to reign over both. There had been a Revolution here as well as in England. The Eyes of the People here were upon William and Mary, and the News of their being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in England was as your Excellency's Hiſtory tells us, "the moſt joyful News ever received in New-England." And if they were not ploclaimed here "by virtue of an Act of the Colony," it was, as we think may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Tenor of your Hiſtory; with the general or univerſal Conſent of the People as apparently as if "ſuch Act had paſſed." It is <hi>Conſent alone,</hi> that makes any human Laws bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as a learned Author obſerves, a purely <hi>voluntary</hi> Submiſſion to an Act, becauſe it is highly in our Favor and for our Benefit, is in all Equity and Juſtice to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Charter, was an Act requiring the taking the Oaths mentioned in an Act of Parliament, to which you refer us: For what Purpoſe was this Act of the Aſſembly paſſed, if it was the Senſe of the Legiſlators that the Act of Parliament was in Force in the Province. And at the ſame Time another Act was made for the Eſtabliſhment of other Oaths neceſſary to be taken; both which Acts have the Royal Sanction, and are now in Force. Your Excellency ſays, that when the Colony applied to King William for a ſecond Charter, they knew the Oath the King had taken, which was to govern them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statutes in Parliament, and (which your Excellency here omits) <hi>the Laws and Cuſtoms of the ſame.</hi> By the Laws and Cuſtoms of Parliament, the People of England freely debate and conſent to ſuch Statutes as are made by themſelves or their choſen Repreſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

According to this Law the King has an undoubted Right to govern us. Your Excellency upon Recollection ſurely will not infer from hence, that it was the Senſe of our Predeceſſors that there was to remain a Supremacy in the Engliſh Parliament, or a full Power and Authority to mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Since Men naturally have no full and perfect Power to command whole politick Multitudes of Men, therefore, utterly without our Conſent we could in ſuch Sort be at no Man's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment living. And to be commanded we do not conſent, when that Society whereof we be a Part, hath at any Time before conſented." We think your Excellency has not proved, either that the Colony is a Part of the politick Society of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or that it has ever conſented that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England or Great Britain ſhould make Laws binding upon us in all Caſes whatever, whether made expreſly to refer to us or not.</p>
            <p>We cannot help before we conclude, expreſſing our great Concern, that your Excellency has thus repeatedly, in a Manner inſiſted upon our free Sentiments on Matters of ſo delicate a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and weighty Importance. The Queſtion appears to us to be no other, than Whether we are the Subjects of abſolute unlimitted Power, or of a free Government formed on the Principles of the Engliſh Conſtitution. If your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's Doctrine be true the People of this Province hold their Lands of the Crown and People of England, and their Lives, Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are at their Diſpoſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that even by Compact and their own Conſent. They are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the King as the Head <hi>alterius Populi</hi> of

another People, in whoſe Legiſlative they have no Voice or Intereſt. They are indeed ſaid to have a Conſtitution and a Legiſlative of their own, but your Excellency has explained it into a mere Phantom; limitted, controuled, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded and nullified at the Will of another. Is this the Conſtitution which ſo charmed our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, that as your Excellency has informed us, they kept a Day of ſolemn Thankſgiving to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God when they received it? And were they Men of ſo little Diſcernment, ſuch Children in Underſtanding, as to pleaſe themſelves with the Imagination that they were bleſſed with the ſame Rights and Liberties which natural born Subjects in England enjoyed, when at the ſame Time they had fully conſented to be ruled and ordered by a Legiſlative a Thouſand Leagues diſtant from them, which cannot be ſuppoſed to be ſufficiently acquainted with their Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if concerned for their Intereſt, and in which they cannot be in any Senſe repreſented.</p>

            <head>On Saturday the 6th of March, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency was pleas'd to put an End to the Seſſion, after delivering the following SPEECH to both Houſes, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen of the Council, and Gentlemen of the Houſe of Repreſentatives,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I THINK it incumbent on me to make ſome Obſervations, before I put an End to the Seſſion, upon your laſt Meſſages to me on the Subject of your Conſtitutional Dependance upon the Supreme Authority of the Britiſh Dominions. As the Council admit a partial Dependence, and ſuppoſe it to be conſiſtent with the Principles and Nature of Government, I ſhall only endeavour very briefly to ſhew the contrary.</p>
            <p>In your firſt Meſſage, Gentlemen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, you made ſome Strictures upon the Nature of the Supreme Authority in Government, both divine and human, the latter of which you deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined could not be abſolute and unlimitted. I thought the Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>inction between divine and human Power not pertinent, and in Anſwer to you, I only remarked, that I had given you no Reaſon to ſuppoſe I in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ended a more abſolute Power in Parliament than what is founded in the Nature of Government, and this, in your ſecond Meſſage, you conſtrue an Acquieſcence in your Reaſons, which it certainly was not. You go on however to explain your Meaning by aſſerting, that "what is uſually denominated the Supre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Authority of a Nation muſt be limited in its Acts to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:012856_0114_0F8B940F4570F990"/>
that are properly or conſtitutionally Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zable by it."</p>
            <p>Before you thus defined the Nature of Supreme Authority, I wiſh you had conſidered more fully what Objects there can be in a Government which are not cognizable by ſuch Authority. You inſtance in a <hi>ſubordinate</hi> Power in Government which, whilſt it keeps within its Limits, is not ſubject to the Controul of the <hi>ſupreme</hi> Power. Is there no Inconſiſtency in ſuppoſing a <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Power without a Power <hi>ſuperior</hi> to it? Muſt it not ſo far as it is without Controul be, itſelf, Supreme?</p>
            <p>It is eſſential to the Being of Government that a Power ſhould always exiſt which no other Power within ſuch Government can have Right to withſtand or controul: Therefore, when the word <hi>Power</hi> relates to the Supreme Authority of Government it muſt be underſtood <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>unlimited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we cannot agree in theſe Principles which no ſenſible Writer upon Government has before denied, and if you are ſtill of Opinion that two Juriſdictions, each of them having a Share in the Supreme Power, are compatible in the ſame State, it can be to no Purpoſe to Reaſon or Argue upon the other Parts of your Meſſage. Its enough to obſerve that this Diſagreement in our Principles will have its Influence upon all the Deductions which are made from them.</p>
            <p>

I will alſo conſider the laſt Meſſage from you, Gentlemen of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, upon the ſame Subject, in as few words as the Importance of it will admit.</p>
            <p>You ſay you have not diſcovered that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples advanced by the Town of Boſton are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable by the Conſtitution. Whether they are or are not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will depend upon the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Point which you are now controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Have not the Doings of that Town been ſent through the Province, accompanied with a circular Letter, "deſiring a free Communication of Sentiments," and, among other Expreſſions of the like Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, lamenting the Extinction of Ardor for civil and religious Liberty if it ſhould be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Voice of the Province, that the Rights as ſtated do not belong to them, and truſting that this cannot be the Caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If the Fundamentals of our Government were not diſputed, theſe Irregularities would appear to you in a very ſtrong Light and you would join in diſcountenancing them.</p>

What this Alteration has been will appear from Hiſtorical Facts. Before the Reign of William the Firſt the Traces of Feudal Tenure are faint, the Evidence of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power, an Aſſembly or Council of Wiſe Men, diſtinct from the Regal Power is ſtrong and ſufficient. After William had obtained the Crown, the other Nations of Europe being under this Syſtem, &amp; particularly his Dominions in Normandy, and Wars being more frequent &amp; Commerce ſmall, and the Means of furniſhing Money, the Sinews of War, difficult if not impracticable, meerly for the Defence of the Kingdom this Polity was ſo for eſtabliſhed as that all the Landholders were made to contribute, by Military or other Services, to the Defence of the State, and for this Purpoſe, and by a Faction only, the Lands were in Form acknowledged to have been originally in the King and held of him by his Subjects, and by this Form ſubjected to a ſuppoſed juſt Proportion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Support of the Kingdom. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

appears to have been made, not by an Act of Regal Power alone but by the Authority of the great Council of the Nation or Aſſembly of the Realm, and the Legiſlative Authority ſtill remained, according to its Nature, paramount and above all other Powers in the Dominion, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly from Time to Time the Abuſes of the Feudal Power either in the Sovereign or in ſuch as held under him were corrected by the Supreme Legiſlative, and Magna Charta itſelf was framed and agreed upon, principally if not altogether for this Purpoſe. In ſucceeding Ages, as Commerce and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ney increaſed and the Means of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing War became more eaſy, theſe Military Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were gradually taken away, either, by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe or commuting for other Services or certain Rents, ſo that at the Period when America was firſt granted, the Remains were inconſiderable and the Lands of the Kingdom were held, generally, by what is called Socage Tenure or, in other Words, an Acknowledgment of Fidelity to the Sovereign, and a certain Rent which was in Name only, or of Value ſo inconſiderable as not to be demanded. The original Claim in the Sovereign, whether at firſt a Fiction or not, ſo far remained as that all Forfeitures, all Eſcheats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all new diſcovered Lands accrued to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs the Supreme Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſhould limit the Right to them, or otherwiſe diſpoſe of them. This was the State of Feudal Tenure in England at the Time when the firſt Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>r was granted, and the Difference between your Syſtem and mine will appear by this fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Inſtance: Louis the 13. of France, I think the ſame Year the Maſſachuſetts Patentees obtained the Grant of that Colony, by a Royal
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012856_0119_0F8B9415F90B35E0"/>
Edict granted to one Hundred Aſſociates the Country of Canada, with Powers of Government and all the Privileges of natural born Subjects of France to all who ſhould go and Inhabit or be Born there, with other very great Powers and Privileges. This, then, appears to be the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent State of the People of the two Colonies. Louis, being an abſolute Monarch, the Regal and Legiſlative Power were united in him. The Inhabitants of Canada therefore were ſubject to him and to every ſucceeding King of France as their Supreme Lord who, by Virtue of his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Power, might at any Time revoke the Royal Edict at Pleaſure, or diſſolve any Charter whatſoever even though like the famous Edict of Nantes it had been declared irrevocable. Charles, having in him the regal Power only, could Grant no more than was in him, and the Legiſlative Power which was in the Parliament muſt ſtill remain there, and conſequently the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of England continued when in the Colony ſtill ſubject to the regal conſtitutional Power of Charles and the ſupreme Legiſlative Power of Parliament. And, I think, nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than that the conſtitutional Reſtraint of the regal Power in Charles prevented the Charter from being revoked and annulled in leſs than Ten Years after the Date of it.</p>
            <p>If this brief Account of Feudal Tenure, as it is Part of the Engliſh Conſtitution, be juſt, as I ſhall think it is until I have better Authority than any I have yet ſeen to the contrary, the Fabrick which you have raiſed will ſtill fail of Support, for it wholly depends upon very different Principles,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012856_0120_0F8B9418357C0058"/>
and upon what you hope I do not mean to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Feudal Syſtem in its Perfection. If this Support fails, there is but little Occaſion for me to remark upon the other Parts of your Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and I ſhall paſs them over, except ſuch as may tend to make wrong Impreſſions upon any unwary Readers.</p>
            <p>You cannot conceive "why the King has not the ſame Right to alienate and diſpoſe of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries acquired by the Diſcovery of his Subjects as he has to reſtore upon a Treaty of Peace Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries acquired in War carried on at the Charge of the Nation, or to ſell and deliver up any Part of his Dominions againſt the general Senſe of the Nation." I will venture to conjecture a Reaſon. By the Engliſh Conſtitution the ſole Power of making War and Peace is in the King. It often happens that the reſtoring and ceding Acquiſitions made in War is abſolutely neceſſary to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of Peace, and if the King was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This Power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeems neceſſarily to reſult from this Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the Crown. And for ſelling any Part of the Dominions againſt the general Senſe of the Nation I never ſuppoſed it to be a Part of the Prerogative, but have called it an Act of <hi>Power,</hi> by which I thought no candid Reader would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any Thing but <hi>meer Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Attempt to ſhew that new diſcovered Countries do not become Part of the State, from the Authority of Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

the Inſtance given by him of a Colony erected into a ſeparate Common Wealth plainly appears by the Context to be by the Leave or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nſent of the Parent State, and it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the other Caſes were not ſo.</p>
            <p>Your Remark upon the Authority I bring to ſhew that the Colony, being feudatory, is under the Government of the King's Laws, is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. You ſuppoſe it muſt mean the King's Laws <hi>abſolutely,</hi> or as you explain it, not the Laws of Parliament. Do any of you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ever to have ſeen the Expreſſion, <hi>the King's Laws,</hi> meaning the King of England, uſed in any other Senſe than <hi>the Laws of the Realm?</hi> You ſay I have not named the Authority. The Caſe I refer to is the King againſt Crowle, in the 2d. Vol Burrow's Reports, and for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which you will find mentioned there, I am not able to name a greater.</p>
            <p>I would paſs over in Silence your Attempt to ſhew that Allegiance is due to the natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and not to the Body Politick of the King, if I had not been well informed that the artificial Reaſoning of Lord Chief Juſtice Coke upon the Doctrine of Allegiance, in the noted Caſe of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you have recited it, had great Weight with ſome of the Members of the Houſe. But have you recited this Caſe truly? After all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements on this Subject does it appear that they can amount to any Thing more than that Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance is not due to the Politick Capacity <hi>only?</hi> And is it not expreſly ſaid that the natural Perſon of the King is ever accompanied with the Politick
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:012856_0122_0F8B941901B16920"/>
Capacity, and the Politick Capacity as it were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Natural Capacity? Or have you any clear Idea of Allegiance to a King in his natural Capacity without any Relation to his political Capacity? From this Authority miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood you infer that I am miſtaken in ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your Allegiance to be due to the <hi>Crown</hi> of England. Without any Refinements, it is plain that it was one Condition, on the Performance whereof the firſt Charter depended, that Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhould be borne to King Charles his Heirs and <hi>Succeſſors.</hi> Wherever therefore the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Crown ſhall go there Allegiance is to follow. The Condition in the ſecond Charter is the ſame, and this is enough for my Purpoſe, which was to ſhew that in whatever Perſon the Regal Authority ſhall be, there your Allegiance is due. I wiſh you had omitted all you have ſaid upon this Subject, for neither the Reaſoning of Lord Coke, nor the Declarations of the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in any Meaſure tend to the Purpoſe for which you produce them.</p>
            <p>Your Aſſertion that Parliament, in regulating the Fiſhery, had nothing in View but to prevent a Monopoly of the Sea, and claimed no Authority over the Plantations or Lands in America, has only your own Authority to ſupport it. It appears from the Debates in Parliament, that it was the Refuſal of the Patentees to ſuffer Fiſh to be dried upon the Land within their Patent, by any Perſon who had not Licence from them, which was complained of as a Grievance, and the Bill was brought in to remove this Grievance: The King might very well refuſe his Aſſent, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012856_0123_0F8B9419C9EB3AF8"/>
Parliament had no Juriſdiction, but becauſe he did not think fit to join with the Lords and Commons in an Act which invalidated or abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Privileges in a Patent of Lands which by his Royal Prerogative he had a Right to grant.</p>
            <p>I will make no particular Remarks upon thoſe Parts of your Meſſage which relate to the Senſe the People have had of their Conſtitution, as there can be no End to Diſputes upon Facts which by ſmall Deviations from the true State of them may be made to ſerve one Side or the other.</p>
            <p>It is evident that the firſt Settlers of this Colony left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> England with a juſt Senſe of their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance—that the Senſe continued until the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Anarchy in England ſpread in America, and it is conceded that theſe Principles were avowed by many of the Inhabitants here for near twenty Years after they were exploded in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. It is equally certain, that at the Time of the Revolution the People returned to a juſt Senſe of the Supremacy of Parliament, and I think I may very ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Gentlemen of the Council and Houſe of Repreſentatives,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that nice Diſtinctions of civil Rights and legal Conſtitutions are far above the Reach of the Bulk of Mankind to comprehend. There are, however, a few plain fundamental Principles of Government which carry within themſelves ſuch Evidence as cannot be reſiſted, and are no ſooner propoſed than aſſented to—Such as theſe—That in every Government there muſt be ſomewhere a ſupreme uncontroulable Power, an abſolute Authority to decide and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine—That two ſuch Powers cannot coexiſt, but neceſſarily will make two diſtinct States—That in a State of Society we give up Part of our natural Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rty in order to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cure that legal Freedom which it is the great End of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to maintain and preſerve—That a Right in Individuals or Parts of a Government to judge of the Deciſions of the Supreme Authority and
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:012856_0125_0F8B941B433797D8"/>
to ſubmit or not ſubmit as they think proper, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt with a State of Government and muſt work the Diſſolution of it. Whilſt theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had their due Influence we enjoyed all that Freedom and all thoſe other Bleſſings which a State of Government will admit of. Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with our Parent State ſecured theſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to us, and by Means of a nominal Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we poſſeſſed as great a Share of real Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as the Parent State itſelf upon which we are ſaid to depend.</p>
            <p>I have laid before you, Gentlemen, what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me to be the true Conſtitution of the Province, and recommended an Adherence to it becauſe I believed it would reſtore us to and continue us in that happy State in which we flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed ſo long a Courſe of Years.</p>
            <p>Certainly it is of the utmoſt Importance to you that theſe Points ſhould be ſettled, for I know of no Maxim in the Law of greater Truth than this. <hi>Where the Conſtitution is conteſted and the Laws are vague and uncertain, there, will be the greateſt Slavery.</hi>
