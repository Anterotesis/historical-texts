            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Aim in this Addreſs to You, is, to diſcharge ſome part of that Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation I am under, to Your tender Care, &amp; moſt friendly Aſſiſtance, to me &amp; my Family; to let the World know how much You have been my Friend, and
<pb facs="unknown:008869_0003_1030A310E19A3BE0"/>
the Pleaſure I take in owning my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be Yours.</p>
            <p>SO often as we have put the Conduct of our <hi>Health</hi> into Your Hands, and ſo often as you have been bleſſed and ſucceeded; after paying our <hi>Vows to God,</hi> the next thing ought to be <hi>Gratitude</hi> to the Inſtrument of Providence in ſo great a Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>BY this Means I have found out a way of faſtning an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon You, without leaving it in Your Power to refuſe me. For that Reaſon I have broke in upon You thus, without aſking Permiſſion; if there be any Fault in that, it is owing to the utter Impatience I am under, of being always obliged.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We were alarmed afreſh, by the Mortality among our Cattle, a Judgment that had gone over all</hi> Europe, <hi>and for which there did not</hi>

               <hi>ſeem to be any human Remedy. We feared it was the Prelude to ſome greater and more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Devaſtation; but the Lord at length ſaid to the deſtroying Angel,</hi> it is enough, ſtay now thine Hand.<note n="a" place="bottom">2 Sam. xxiv. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I was excited by theſe Providences, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and put in order ſome Thoughts I had laid together upon the</hi> Importance of Health, <hi>its</hi> Precariouſneſs, <hi>and its beſt</hi> Improvement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The World agrees in the Valuation of this Bleſſing, and have a general Senſe of its brittle Nature; and therefore I pretend not to make</hi> Diſcoveries, <hi>but to make</hi> Impreſſions, <hi>if I can, and to recommend that</hi> Uſe and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Health, <hi>without which it is indeed a Reproach upon any one to pretend to know that it is a Bleſſing ſo</hi> important <hi>and ſo</hi> vaniſhing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a great deal writ about the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Health. It is for the Service of Health, that Men have travelled, ſtudied, ſpent their Time, laid out their Money, their Strength, and even</hi> Health <hi>itſelf, in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Health: and yet after all, the</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this Health, <hi>is of greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance than the thing itſelf.</hi> Health, <hi>though a very great Bleſſing, is not for its own ſake, but for ſome farther and nobler End. It is</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:008869_0007_1030A31B44620648"/>
               <hi>to be regretted, that the moſt delectable, moſt diffuſive, and moſt eſteemed Bleſſing in Nature, ſhould be the leaſt</hi> improved, <hi>or not directed to its moſt</hi> excellent Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Miſſionary <hi>tells us, that when all the Books in</hi> China <hi>were ordered to be burnt by the Emperor</hi> Chiohamti, <hi>thoſe in</hi> Phyſic <hi>were preſerved by a peculiar Exception.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Letre 8.</note> 
               <hi>As if the</hi> Whole Duty of Man <hi>was only</hi> curare cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiam, <hi>to keep the Body in good Caſe, and to ſtudy nothing but how to</hi> be well.</p>
            <p>Pindar <hi>has a bold Stroke, ſpeaking in the Praiſe of</hi> Health: A Man (<hi>ſays he</hi>) that is in good Health, rich in Honour, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys it all to a good Old Age, need not trouble himſelf about being a God.<note n="c" place="bottom">Pindar. in Olympiis.</note> 
               <hi>I wiſh this were nothing but Poetry, Fiction, and Invention all, without any Example of any Character formed, or Lives led upon the ſame Sentiments. I wiſh the Profaneneſs of the Turn were to be found no where but in the Poet, or that the Men of Riches, Health, and Honour, were ſo mended ſince his Days, as that thoſe three things were not indeed to them inſtead of all that was</hi> divine. <hi>But, oh</hi> Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar! <hi>will</hi> Health <hi>do inſtead of Immortality and eternal Life? Is there any Receipt for Immortality but this, that my Subject commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:008869_0008_1030A31E34136BC0"/>
               <hi>to the World?</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> the beſt Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this beſt of Bleſſings? <hi>Having mentioned</hi> Health, Wealth, <hi>and</hi> Honour, <hi>doſt thou leave us there? Will it do any Harm to go farther, and to the charming Ideas of Health, Wealth, and Honour, join the Epithet of eternal? I can no more be ſatisfied with any thing that I know muſt come to an End, than I can be eaſy in thinking that my own Being would do ſo. Why not aſpire to be</hi> Divine, <hi>though not to be a God? Why doſt thou ſtop ſhort of that</hi> Health, <hi>thoſe</hi> durable Riches and Honours, <hi>for the ſake of which only, it was worth our while to have been born, and for the actual Enjoyment of which, it is at any time worth our while to die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After all that is or can be ſaid of</hi> Health, <hi>its higheſt</hi> Elogium <hi>is, that it is the greateſt temporal Bleſſing, and enters as the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>I am ſenſible the Order of ſome Parts of this Eſſay might have been better diſpoſed, and how much it might have been enriched and improved by Perſons of greater Acquaintance with that ſort of Learning that borders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject. Nay, I am ready to think, that I could have made it more compleat myſelf, ſince the improvements I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Addition made to the little Knowledge I had before of the</hi> Human Structure, <hi>from the entertaining Lectures of the moſt obliging Mr.</hi> Cheſelden; <hi>in whom I know not which to admire moſt, the Exquiſiteneſs of his Skill, or the eaſy, frank, and generous Manner of his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of it to the Curious. But my other Affairs would not permit me to write that Part over again, and ſo I let it go with ſuch Amendments as I could conveniently inſert. The Learned that way do not need, and others won't miſs it. What I have produced, I judge ſufficient to illuſtrate that Chapter which contains this Propoſition, that</hi> Health for a conſiderable Time is a wonderful thing; that it is not to be depended upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This would lead me to that part of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face which I have always thought might beſt of all be ſpared: that is, a mighty Solicitude about the Reception of a Piece into the World. But I ſhall ſpare myſelf and Reader any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

               <hi>Trouble than only to ſay, that when a Man has endeavoured to oblige a few Friends, and do a little Good in his own Manner and Way, and committed all to the Bleſſing of God, he ought to be content with Neighbour's Fare, and muſt ſubmit to the Way of the World.</hi>

               <p>IT is obſerv'd in the Nature of <hi>Light,</hi> that tho' it be the moſt familiar to us of any Thing in the World, and <hi>That</hi> by which we ſee every Thing elſe, yet it is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us in itſelf, and hardly to be defin'd. So it is in the Matter of Health, which is the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of the little World: We better know when we are well, than we know properly what it is to be ſo. I believe it is for this Reaſon that the

Sons of Art, who are the Tutelar Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of our Health, are ſo ſparing in their Definitions of what it is their Profeſſion to reſtore and maintain.</p>
               <p>

'Tis obſerv'd of him, that he gives the ſame Name to <hi>Virtue,</hi> which is indeed the <hi>Health</hi> of the Soul, as Health is the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the Body. <hi>Harmony</hi> was with him one of the Names of the Deity; ſo that this Word <hi>Harmony,</hi> ſeems to have been a darling Word with him, which he gave to ſeveral good Things. But by <hi>Harmony</hi> in this Caſe, he ſeems to intend, a <hi>right Proportion, Quantity, and Temperature of all the Fluids; Soundneſs and Strength in all the Solids, to perform their Functions; and to render it complete, a Mind fit to direct all the Motions that obey the Will; which is, in a Word, the Univerſal Rectitude of the Animal OEconomy.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the great Value and Bleſſing of Health.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>SOME Writers in caſting up the moſt deſirable good Things of Life, have given them this Rank, <hi>Health, Beauty</hi> and <hi>Riches;</hi> of the firſt, (ſays Sir <hi>William Temple</hi>) I find no Diſpute, but of the two others, much may be ſaid. For Beauty is a Good that makes others happy rather than ones ſelf; and how Riches ſhould claim ſo high a Rank, I cannot tell, when ſo great, ſo wiſe, ſo good a Part of Mankind, have in all Ages ſhewn, that they could be happy without them, and made it part of their Wiſdom and Happineſs that they knew how to be ſo. But Health is ſo neceſſary to what we call temporal Happineſs, that the greateſt and wiſeſt of Men have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ready to own it to be, not only an Ingredient, but the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it.<note n="f" place="bottom">

Were I to deliver the Scale of the Bleſſings of this Life, according to the Place they hold in my Mind, it ſhould be in this Order; a peaceful Conſcience, my Time, Health, Learning and Knowledge, Liberty, Temper, or Self-government, Friendſhip, and Riches. Firſt, a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>peaceful Conſcience;</hi> to have every Thing within, ſerene and calm; and tho' I grant this does alſo belong to the Liſt of ſpiritual Bleſſings, yet it is ſo neceſſary to our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Enjoyment of Life, that without it, every Thing elſe muſt needs be embitter'd and ſpoil'd. Next to that I muſt value my <hi>Time:</hi> becauſe nothing can be enjoy'd without Time to enjoy it in; and becauſe of what depends upon the Improvement of it, for both Worlds; beſides, when 'tis gone, it is an irrecoverable Thing, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing in this World vaniſhes with it. The next Bleſſing in Value and Excellence is Health. This is neceſſary to the perfect Enjoyment of a Man's ſelf, and of every Thing about him, you can name after it. <hi>Knowledge and Learning</hi> ought to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned next: Health and Learning make the Philoſophers happy Men. <hi>Thales</hi> gave this for Anſwer to the Queſtion, Who was the happy Man? <hi>He</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that has a healthful Body, and a learned Mind.</hi>

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008869_0020_1030A341D6041BC0"/>
now it is Time to mention <hi>Liberty.</hi> Health and Liberty are Bleſſings pretty much of a Size. Without <hi>Health</hi> we could not enjoy <hi>Liberty,</hi> nor without <hi>Liberty, Health.</hi> The publick Vows of the <hi>Roman</hi> People joined them together, as appears by the Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. One would think that a Man with a good Conſcience, and healthful Body and a learned Mind, might, even without fair Liberty, make a Shift not to be miſerable. On the other Hand, there are, to whom Liberty appears a greater Bleſſing than Life it ſelf. The Deciſion here will very much depend upon the Degrees of Reſtraint taken into the Caſe. The next in my Order ſhould be what we call <hi>Temper;</hi> that Equanimity that preſerves our inward Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility from lying at the Mercy of every croſs Accident or Diſappointment. By this a Man is ſaid to poſſeſs himſelf; has a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> within himſelf for a calm Serenity in the fouleſt Weather, and for his Soul <hi>to dwell at Eaſe</hi> in the Midſt of Trouble. By this Temper we farther mean that <hi>Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> or Benignity of Diſpoſition which is the Principle of all that Delight, which the Generous conceive in doing Good <hi>to</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and making thoſe about them pleaſed and eaſy; and is the ſecret <hi>Charm</hi> or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive of that Good-will <hi>from</hi> others, with which it ſeldom fails to be rewarded. The
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008869_0021_1030A3474F9096B0"/>
next Rank in the Ingredients of temporal Happineſs I would aſſign to <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> Nothing does ſo much improve and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply a Bleſſing to one's own Enjoyment, as the having ſome Body to impart it to, and communicate Indearments with. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> reckons Friendſhip next to Health;
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Nil ego praetulerim jucundo ſanus amico.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
And then in the laſt Place <hi>Riches:</hi> Not meaning thereby the over-grown, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy, the cumberſome Wealth, wherein Man's <hi>Life does not conſiſt;</hi> but by Riches, I mean ſuch a Competency of the good Things of Life as a Man has always been accuſtomed to, and may anſwer reaſonable Deſires, and furniſh out for the Enjoyment of the Bleſſings already mentioned. And whether Riches in this Senſe muſt have a Place in the Account of temporal Bleſſings, is a Queſtion that muſt be very odly ſtated indeed, to be anſwered in the Negative.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Health</hi> ſtands in this Account at the Head of all merely temporal Bleſſings: And I ſhall vindicate that Place to it from the abſolute Neceſſity of it, both to the <hi>Services</hi> and <hi>Enjoyments</hi> of Life; and ſhall farther illuſtrate the Value of <hi>Health</hi> from its Serviceableneſs to the <hi>Purpoſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and from the Miſeries of the contrary State of <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> and the general <hi>Conſent</hi> of the World.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I. The Value of Health from the Neceſſity of it to the Services of Life.</head>
                  <p>IF we were all Body, there could be no greater Bleſſing than this. The Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, the Purſuit, the Finiſhings, of the great and uſeful Affairs of Life, are owing to this. Stately Buildings, flouriſhing Arts and Sciences, learned Reſearches and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures; the Hurry of thronged Streets, the Buſineſs of the Exchange; victorious Arms, aſſiduous Counſels and Negotiations of Princes, the Spoils of War, or of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; they all grow out of <hi>Health.</hi> What a Stagnation does the want of it bring upon all the Operations both of the Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Natural? With the languid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, with fainting Spirits, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Limbs, heavy Pulſe, and a ſinking Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, every Thing elſe ſinks and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes.</p>
                  <p>Not only particular Perſons are diſabled by want of Health in their private Affairs; and Families, where the chief Manager has been valetudinary, have dwindled in their Subſtance and Eſtate, the Vigour of the Mind decaying with that of the Body; and not only Humour and Invention, but even Judgment and Reſolution, ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008869_0023_1030A34AD044C798"/>
the active Life, change and languiſh with the ill Conſtitution of Body &amp; Health: But Kingdoms themſelves are very often affected by the Health or Sickneſs of thoſe that rule them; and the publick Health and Conſtitution is very much felt in the Prince's Pulſe. <hi>Charles</hi> IX. King of <hi>France,</hi> 'twas very much to his weak and ſickly Conſtitution that he owed the Mortification of ſeeing a ſickly and convulſed Kingdom. The Indiſpoſition of <hi>Rheuta,</hi> the ſeventh King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> gave his Nephew ſuch an Opportunity of practiſing for the Crown, that he was obliged at length to reſign.</p>
                  <p>The Conſtitution languiſhes, where the Laws and their Adminiſtration are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd with Vigour from him that ſits at the Helm. Officers of State are the Nerves and Sinews of the publick Body: Where they are not quicken'd by a briſk Spirit that flows down into them from the <hi>Head,</hi> they are not ſo likely to exert themſelves with that Sureneſs, Pleaſure, &amp; Eaſe. The publick Felicity ſo much depends upon this, that all Religions agree in injoining the Duty of praying for Governors; and Chriſtianity, whoſe Dictates, were they but obſerved, would promote the Welfare of all Ranks and Orders of Men, both in this Life, and that to come, has in a particular Manner recommended this to every one of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008869_0024_1030A34DBA7D6F38"/>
its Profeſſors, that they pray for <hi>Kings, and for all in Authority.</hi> This is never done with ſo much ſincere Vehemency, as when it is for ſuch good Princes as are <hi>Miniſters of God for Good</hi> to their People, <hi>a Praiſe to them that do well, and a Terror only to Evil-doers.</hi>

I have obſerved the Fate of <hi>Campania</hi> determine contrary to all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, by the Caution and Conduct of a General, which were attributed by thoſe that knew him to his Age and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, rather than his own true Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, acknowledged otherwiſe to have been as great as moſt Men of the Age. I have ſeen the Counſels of a noble Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try grow bold, or timorous, according to the Fits of his good or ill Health that managed them, and the Pulſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment beat high or low with that of the Governor; and this unequal Conduct
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008869_0025_1030A353383C6878"/>
makes Way for great Accidents in the World: Nay, I have often reflected upon the Counſels and Fortunes of the greateſt Monarchies, riſing and decaying ſenſibly with the Ages and Healths of the Princes and chief Officers that govern'd them. And I remember one great Miniſter that confeſt to me, when he fell into one of his uſual Fits of the Gout, he was no longer able to bend his Mind or Tho'ts to any publick Buſineſs, nor give Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences beyond two or three of his own Domeſticks, though it were to <hi>ſave a Kingdom;</hi> and that this proceeded not from any Violence of Pain, but from a general Languiſhing and Faintneſs of Spirits, which made him in thoſe Fits think nothing worth the Trouble of one careful and ſollicitous Thought: For the Approaches or Lurking of the Gout, the Spleen, or the Scurvy, nay, the very Fumes of Indigeſtion, may indiſpoſe Men to Thought and to Care, as well as Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of Danger and Pain.</p>
                     <p>Thus Accidents of Health grow to be Accidents of State; and the publick Conſtitutions come to depend in a great Meaſure upon thoſe of particular Men: Which makes it perhaps ſeem neceſſary in the Choice of Perſons for great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments (at leaſt ſuch as require con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

Upon this Account I ſuppoſe it was, that among the other Qualities of that great Miniſter of State, <hi>De Wit,</hi> the great Care he had of his <hi>Health,</hi> and the little Regard he had to his <hi>Life,</hi> were not the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> was one of the greateſt Soldiers of his Time, an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Prince, meditating vaſt Deſigns; as ſome Paſſages in his Life, that are very well known, give a pleaſant Account of. He knew to how little Purpoſe the beſt Talents that could meet in a Commander were like to be without <hi>Health;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the Days of the moſt ſolemn Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Prayers, the Bleſſings that he came into the Temple to implore of the Gods, was <hi>[Hygiainein] Health.</hi> As the Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would not do without Health, ſo with it he thought himſelf capable of procuring all the reſt to himſelf. He built a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>Health,</hi> and declar'd he would wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip no other God nor Goddeſs; and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Matter ſo far, as to inſinuate, that if the Gods would but give him Health, <hi>he could give himſelf every Thing elſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Graecians</hi> made it a Goddeſs: The <hi>Sicaonians</hi> worſhipped the Image of <hi>Health,</hi> and the Women offer'd their Hair to it; that is, they ſacrificed their Ornaments to

their Health. And as barbarous as this may ſeem to be, they that ſacrifice their Health to their <hi>Ornaments,</hi> worſhip the meaner Idol of the two.</p>
                  <p>This ſort of Idolatry, of making a <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs</hi> of Health, is not to be found only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen: There is ſomething like it among ſome that would take it ill not to be called Chriſtians. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> built a Temple to Health; ſo have the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and inſtituted an annual Feſtival to the <hi>Publick Health.</hi> The Church <hi>Della Salute,</hi> is a noble Church at <hi>Venice,</hi> one of thoſe that was the Effect of a Vow, which the State made when they were infected with the Plague.<note n="k" place="bottom">Burnet'<hi>s Letters.</hi>

                  <p>WE are next to conſider the Value of Health <hi>from the abſolute Neceſſity of it to the Enjoyments of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it has a great Stroke: It gives a Reliſh to, and is the Foundation of all the Comforts of Life. If I am ſick my ſelf, the World withers, and is blaſted to me, as every Thing is ſpoiled that is poured into tainted Veſſel. What is a well-ſpead Table to a nauſeating Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or a loſt Appetite? Who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Pleaſures of Drinks muſt have his Mouth in Taſte. Nay, to find any Felicity, or take any Pleaſure, in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Advantages of Honour or Fortune, a Man muſt be in Health. The World agrees ſo univerſally in this, that the firſt Concern we diſcover for each other is about our <hi>Health:</hi> The firſt Queſtion is, <hi>How do you do?</hi> This is the firſt Salutation when we meet; this is the Wiſh we ſend to our abſent Friends; this begins our Epiſtles, [<hi>Salutem</hi>] and this cloſes them, [<hi>Vale;</hi>] and has done ſo, for ought I know, as long as Writing has been in the World. We ſend Meſſages and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries with the ſame Queſtion. 'Tis for this that Men travel into diſtant Countries, clamber the <hi>Alps</hi> for Herbs and Plants, hang upon the Out-ſide of Rocks and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008869_0031_1030A362D271CD40"/>
dive to the Bottom of the Sea, dig into the Bowels of the Earth, exhauſt their Spirits in Study, labour at Furnaces; and happy is the Man that can make any Diſcovery towards the preſerving of Health and long Life. He is in a fairer Way of being an <hi>Alderman</hi> (as one ſays) than he that can ſhew the ſure Way to <hi>Heaven.</hi> 'Tis the Value of Health that gives Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Riches to ſome Profeſſions, and finds Buſineſs for ſo many others. 'Twas this that made <hi>AEſculapius</hi> a God, and the poor Woman in the Goſpel a <hi>Beggar;</hi> for what will a Perſon think too much to recover Eaſe, return to the Buſineſs, and to enjoy the Pleaſure Life.</p>
                  <p>In a State of Health a Coxcomb may indeed deſpiſe Phyſicians, as a Free-thinker laughs at Religion when he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at a good Diſtance from experimenting the (<hi>Grand Peut-êſtre,</hi>

Health Youth loſes all its Vigour, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty all its Charms; the ſofteſt Muſick, grates in our Ears; Converſation is diſagreable; Palaces are Priſons, or of equal Confinement; Riches are uſeleſs (as to Enjoyments) Honour and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance are cumberſome, and Crowns themſelves a Burden.</q> What Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are there in lower Life, that can ſubſiſt in Pain and Sickneſs? I ſaid, in lower Life, but if Diſeaſes are painful and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, they equal all Conditions of Life, make no difference between a Prince and a Beggar. <q>A Fit of the Stone or Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, puts a King to the Rack, and makes him as Miſerable as he can do the meaneſt, the worſt and moſt crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of his Subjects.</q>

                  <p>Princes have been ſo ſenſible of this, as to give their Phyſicians ſometimes an Opportunity of making themſelves very neceſſary to them. Dread of Sickneſs and Pain, well managed, by one who has Skill enough to increaſe <hi>this</hi> Diſtemper, and remove <hi>others;</hi> will ſecure the Place not only of a Phyſician but of a Favorite.

By this Means, ſome of them have held Princes themſelves in a ſort of Subjection to them.

                  <p>IN all Parts of Religion the Body is a <hi>Companion,</hi> in ſome, it muſt be an <hi>Agent;</hi> and in thoſe Parts of Religion wherein the Body is employed, it will perform but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily if it be not in Health.

We never ſet ſuch a Value upon our Health as when we have loſt it: Health is never ſo welcome as when it comes with a Letter of Recommendation from Sickneſs.

                  <p>I Shall add one Conſideration more, from whence the Value and Worth of this Bleſſing will farther appear, and that is, <hi>from the Eſteem the ſacred Writings expreſs of it, and the Price put upon it by thoſe, who were above the Danger of over valuing any worldly Bleſſing, or of marking it down in a wrong Place with an inſpired Pen.</hi>

exert a noble Soul, in an healthful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                  <p>No body muſt be perfectly happy in this Life, however great or good, (<hi>ante obitum nemo ſupremaque funera, &amp;c.</hi>) either in Mind, Body or Affairs, there will be ſomething always to put a good Man in Mind, that <hi>this is not his Reſting-place;</hi> ſomething that may prompt him to ſeek, and diſpoſe him to go to the Bleſſedneſs of a perfect State.</p>
                  <p>Again, neither <hi>Love nor Hatred</hi> are to be known by the Things that are before us: He whom Chriſt <hi>loved was ſick,</hi> and ſuffer'd to die too, it may be more than once; and here was one of the beſt of Men wanted one of the beſt of temporal Bleſſings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a Man there was certainly no want of Means, and being ſo good a Man there was no want of Prayer. Doubtleſs he improved the Happineſs of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with ſuch Men as the Apoſtles, and of his being ſo well beloved of them, ſo as to ſecure their Prayers, as well as he uſed his own. But the Apoſtles could not heal arbitrarily, and to pleaſe their own, meerly human, Affection. The Gifts of Healing we ſee were only ſubſervient to the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their Doctrine, and exerted under proper Impulſes; or elſe St. <hi>John</hi> could as eaſily have beſtowed Health as wiſh'd it, to his beloved <hi>Gaius,</hi> whom God ſaw fit,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008869_0045_1030A38E96CDFF58"/>
for Ends above our Reach, to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Indiſpoſition. 'Tis not unlikely that his infirm Body might very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to this proſperous State of his Soul; for while Men live as dying Creatures, and look upon themſelves as at the Gate of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, this World has leſs Force upon us, which we are leaving, and the other more, to which we look upon our ſelves to be ſo near.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe of this excellent Man was very rare &amp; admirable, that a Man's Soul ſhould be in ſo proſperous a Condition, that one can't wiſh more, either to Affairs, or Body, than to have them <hi>proſper even as the Soul did.</hi> Generally 'tis quite otherwiſe, the Body proſpers, but the Soul pines and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes; the Body thrives and is vigorous, the Soul withers and ſtarves; and to wiſh their Body and Affairs in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with their Souls, would be the ſame thing as curſing both with Confuſion and Decay. Few in Number are thoſe happy Perſons, whoſe Soul-Proſperity might be the Standard of our utmoſt Wiſhes for that which is Temporal. Beloved <hi>Gaius</hi> was ſuch an one, and Religion has the Credit of a few others that are a like Ornament to it; but for the moſt part we fear the Caſe is ſo different, that it might well frighten us, if this Wiſh of the Apoſtles
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008869_0046_1030A3918779D180"/>
were to be the Meaſure of God's dealing with us and our Affairs; and he ſhould ſay, Come, your bodily Health and Affairs in the World ſhall thrive under my Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, juſt as your Souls thrive under the means of Grace; I'll make the Complexion of your Soul viſible in the outward Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Body and Affairs. What Work would this make? How would ſome Eſtates dwindle, and ſome Bodies conſume and pine? The declining State of a Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider would be legible in his running to Ruin; the Breakings out of the Body would tell all the foul Spots and Pollutions that are within; the Flames of Luſt would catch hold of the Body, and the burning Fever in the Pulſe, proclaim the defiling Heats that are in the Mind: A ſwelling Dropſy would let every one know where dwelt the covetous Soul, that is unſatiable, and never knows when it has enough: How many would loſe their Sight, or ſee but a little thrô the affected <hi>Ignorance that is in them?</hi> In ſhort, we ſhould ſee ſome Bodies break out all over, like <hi>Job'</hi>s upon the Dunghil, and ſwarm with Vermin, whoſe Souls do actually ſwarm with what is worſe than any Vermin in the World, <abbr>

                  <p>We may obſerve farther, that Proſperity to our outward Affairs may be deſired and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008869_0047_1030A3946E85CA40"/>
prayed for by the moſt ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Perſons, without the Imputation of a worldly Mind. St. <hi>John</hi> was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſon, who made this Prayer;<note n="x" place="bottom">Euchomâi.</note> and ſo was <hi>Gaius,</hi> for whom 'twas made. They knew that Religion in its greateſt Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality did not oblige us to exclude the World entirely from our Prayers and Wiſhes, and give it no Place; but to make it know and keep its proper Place, which is, to give Way to Religion in the Competition, and to give Aſſiſtance to it upon Demand. The Apoſtle muſt have a great Opinion of this Man, to think he would be never the worſe for the Proſperity and Health he wiſhed him. Health was the chief Article of that Proſperity he had wiſhed him before, and the moſt excellent Species of all the Bleſſings to which Proſperity is the general Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of it in very high Terms, <hi>I wiſh above all Things;</hi> and, as we have render'd them, ſuch Terms as muſt be underſtood with ſome Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for no truly good Man can value or wiſh for Proſperity and Health, <hi>above all Things elſe,</hi> abſolutely. 'Tis the Property of true Goodneſs to ſeek <hi>firſt the Kingdom of God,</hi> from whence it derives, and its Language is, <hi>There is nothing upon Earth</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="unknown:008869_0048_1030A397607C19E0"/>
                     <hi>we deſire in Compariſon of that.</hi> The Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof muſt be, Above all <hi>Temporal Bleſſings,</hi> or, <hi>In</hi> all other Things, or, <hi>As to</hi> all other Things.<note n="y" place="bottom">Non dubito quin animo ſis tali, qualem op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare poſſem Hoc idem opto de corpore &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus aliis; <hi>Optandum eſt ut ſit mens ſana in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore ſano.</hi> Grot.</note> I wiſh you proſperous Affairs, &amp; an healthful Body, as additional Bleſſings to a gracious Soul: <hi>Mens ſana in Corpore ſano.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far have I repreſented the Value of Health, from the Neceſſity of it to the Buſineſs and Affairs of Life, and to the Reliſh of any of its Pleaſures; from the Uſe of it to the Purpoſes of Religion; from the Miſery of Sickneſs; and from the high Rank the Scripture has ſet it in, and the Valuation put upon it by the beſt of Men.</p>
                  <p>Before I go any farther, I ſhall make here two Remarks, that are very proper to be thought on, while the Evidence of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of this Bleſſing is freſh upon the Mind.</p>
                  <p>The one is upon <hi>the Folly of throwing away ſo great a Bleſſing for ſome mean De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, ſome preſent Pleaſure and Gratification.</hi> 'Tis a Sin againſt God to unfit our ſelves for the Services of Religion, and of Life, in Greedineſs of ſome ſingle Senſations: And 'tis Nonſenſe for the Sake of <hi>one</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to loſe a Thouſand, nay, to deſtroy
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008869_0049_1030A39A49A14560"/>
the very Foundation of <hi>All. Plutarch</hi> ſays very well, That Diſeaſes do not ſo much rob us of Buſineſs, and Journeys, and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, as of Pleaſure: So that if a Man would continue his Pleaſure, he muſt take Care to preſerve his Health, without which there is none, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) he muſt omit ſome ſmall and ſhort, for the Sake of great &amp; laſting Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Pleaſure is of that Nature, that it cannot be born alive in the Midſt of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers. Health is to Pleaſure what fair Weather is to the <hi>Halcyon</hi> Bird, that gives it a peaceful Birth, and a commodious Neſt<note n="z" place="bottom">Plutarch. De Sanitate tuendâ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all this while we are ſpeaking theſe Things of bodily Pleaſures, that do ſo much depend upon bodily Health, we do at the ſame Time demonſtrate in the next Place the <hi>Excellence of True Religion,</hi> that gives Pleaſures which do not lie at the Mercy of any Diſeaſes, that do not depend upon Health, and conſequently are not loſt with it; gives Pleaſures that are Supports under the Loſs of Health; nay, are ſometimes noble Equivalents for it, provided our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be undiſturb'd, and the Chriſtian has a clear Evidence of his good Condition. 'Tis agreed that bodily Health is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all worldly Pleaſures; conſequently,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008869_0050_1030A39D36782338"/>
when that fails, <hi>they</hi> muſt do ſo too: But even then do religious Pleaſures not only ſubſiſt, but improve, enlarge, grow, and diſtinguiſh themſelves; and are like the Soul, which is the Seat and Subject of them, ſpiritual, immortal, and out of the Reach of Diſtemper and Accident. A good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, clear Evidences for Heaven, Senſe of divine Favour, Proſpect of the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward, are Pleaſures that depend not on bodily Health, Pleaſures that give noble Airs to the good Soul, ſhining il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtriouſly through the Cracks of a diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body; Pleaſures that make Religion look like it ſelf, glorious, heavenly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. Certainly true Religion muſt be a pleaſant Thing, whoſe Delights cannot only ſubſiſt, but are ſometimes exalted, when the very Foundation of all other Pleaſures is utterly deſtroyed. <q>O Bleſſed God! grant that I may make ſure of that which will give me Pleaſure of its own, when all others are gone, and do me ſome Service when nothing elſe can.</q>

Health is really too great a Bleſſing to be play'd away againſt ſo mean a Stake as the Shout of half a dozen Companions; or to bear away the Repute of a Quality, in which I am out-done by ſeveral Brutes.

preſent ſenſible Intereſt in the divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and our future eternal Happineſs. What is it to God or Man whether that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be well or ſick, be dead or alive, who takes ſo much Care of his Health as to have no Regard to all theſe?</p>
                  <p>One would think ſome Perſons more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of loſing their Health than of loſing all theſe; more afraid of being ſick than of being damn'd: They ſhut themſelves up in their Apartment from the Duties of Life, and the Service of God; not ſo much from being really ill, as from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Fear of being ſo: The Wind muſt not blow upon them, the Weather is not to be encounter'd by them, the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of God's Worſhip are not to be born by Complexions ſo nice and fine; 'till at length they have contracted ſuch a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Delicacy, that they can indeed bear nothing at all: And what was their Sin in the Beginning, is their Puniſhment in the End.</p>
                  <p>God forbid that I ſhould inſinuate a Charge upon Caſes wherein God makes Allowance, and <hi>will have Mercy rather than Sacrifice.</hi> Such is the Condition of many aged and infirm, and otherwiſe diſabled Perſons.

But what ſhall we ſay of ſuch Perſons, who as indiſpos'd as they are generally on the Lord's-Day, are ſeen to purſue the Affairs and Diverſions of Life all the Week, that are ten Times the Riſque of Health that any Parts of God's Worſhip can be, this muſt be own'd to look a little ſuſpicious.</p>
                  <p>When I ſee ſome good People, who love the Houſe of God, <hi>and the Place where his Honour dwells,</hi> making hard Shift, through all the real Weakneſſes of Age and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, to come to him, and enjoy him there; and when I meet with ſome others, moſt affectingly bewailing on a Sick-bed their Neglects of Duty upon too ſlight Occaſions, <hi>O that I had now but one Quarter of that Health I enjoyed when I fancied my ſelf too much indiſpoſed to wait upon God! Oh, the Guilt I have contracted, the Benefit, Comfort, and Pleaſure, I have loſt, by indulging too much an affected Softneſs of Life, and to imaginary Diſtempers!</hi> I ſay, when I obſerve the hard Shifts of the one, and the Complaints of the other, I cannot but think ſuch a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this may have its Uſe.</p>

                  <p>THAT which is of the moſt exquiſite Make, may with much Difficulty and Hazard, poſſibly, be preſerved in its natural State, by a great deal of Care to keep it out of Harms Way; but that's impoſſible in this Caſe; the bare Change of Weather may as well diſcompoſe the Body, as untune the Strings of an Inſtrument. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by one of the Faculty, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Manner:<note n="o" place="bottom">

                     <q>It is ſo far (ſays he) from being a Wonder, that we ſometimes ſuffer in our Health by Change of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is the greateſt Wonder we do not always ſo; for, when we conſider, that our Bodies are ſometimes preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a Tun and an half Weight more than at another, and that this Variation is often very ſudden; it is ſurprizing that every ſuch Change ſhould not entirely break the Frame of our Bodies to pieces, and be the conſtant Harbinger of ſudden Death. One would think that when ſo many of the Veſſels of our Bodies are
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:008869_0086_1030A4094887F9A8"/>
ſtraitned by the increaſed Preſſure, that the Blood would ſtagnate up to the very Heart; which not being able to contract it ſelf, the Circulation would ceaſe, and we ſhould die. But ſuch is the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of infinite Wiſdom, that when the Reſiſtance to the circulating Blood is greateſt, the Impetus by which the Heart contracts, ſhould be ſo too. The Weight of the Air increaſing, the Lungs will be more forceably expanded, and hereby the Blood more intimately broken and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, ſo that it becomes fitter for the moſt fluid Secretions, ſuch as that of the Animal Spirits, by which the Heart will be more ſtrongly contracted; the Bloods Motion toward the Surface of the Body being obſtructed, it will paſs in greater Quantity to the Brain, where the Preſſure of the Air is taken off by the Cranium; and, upon this Score, more Spirits will be ſeparated, whereby the Heart will be ſo ſtrongly contracted as to carry on the Circulation thro' the paſſable Canals, whilſt ſome others are obſtructed.</q> Thus far the Doctor.</p>
                  <p>What Hazard is here to our Health and Life even from imperceivaable Changes of Weather? That a Man muſt almoſt look upon his Weather-Glaſs as the Meaſure of

his Health and Life. What Contrivance, what Artifice in our Compoſition to prevent the fatal Effects of ſo ſudden a Change? And what Hazard in that Mechaniſm leſt it ſhould not play its Part with that Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and unobſtructed Regularity as to prevent the Miſchief? Do we wonder that People drop down dead? It is rather a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wonder that they ſo ſeldom do ſo.</p>
                  <p>When we turn our Eyes from the Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Frame to the infinite Accidents that are every where ready to ruffle and deſtroy it, it increaſes the Wonder! The inimitable Structure of human Bodies is ſcarce more admirable, than that ſuch curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and elaborate Engines ſhould be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived as to be no oftner out of Order than they are; the Preſervation of ſo nice and exact a Frame being the next Wonder to the Workmanſhip.<note n="p" place="bottom">Boyl'<hi>s Occas.

an infectious Vapour drawn into the Lungs, and ſo mixing with the Blood, and circulating the Corruption into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Part; how a ſudden Fright, or a Piece of ill News, are able to produce Sickneſs and Death; when I think too how many Miſchiefs our own Appeties or Vices ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to, by Acts of Intemperance, that neceſſitate the Creatures to offend us; and Practices of Sin, whereby we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Creator to puniſh us; when, I ſay, I conſider all this, and conſequently how many Miſchiefs he muſt eſcape that arrives at grey Hairs, I confeſs the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs of the Sight can't keep me from thinking it worth ſome Wonder to ſee an OLD MAN, eſpecially if he be any Thing healthy.<note n="q" place="bottom">Boyl'<hi>s Occaſ.

home alive and well: It may be a Fall, a Bruiſe, a Tile from a Houſe, a Thruſt with a Sword, Diſcharge of a Gun, a Blow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigned, the Tooth of an Adder, the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of a poiſonous Herb inſtead of an whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome one, the like Miſtake of a Drug thro' the Ignorance or Heedleſſneſs of thoſe you truſt, the Throwing a Stone, the Trip of a Foot, the Scratch of a Nail, the Wrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off a Bit of Skin: Theſe are Accidents that have done as ſure Execution, though not ſo wide and ſpreading, as Famine, War, or Peſtilence. The Pairing of a Nail, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Corn, the Rent of a little Skin, from the Side of the Finger, putting a Patch upon a little Pimple, the Plucking off a ſingle Hair: Theſe have ſometimes done the Buſineſs as effectually as Gun or Piſtol.

Nothing is ſo ſmall as not to be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal Diſeaſe and Death under it.</p>
                  <p>Diſeaſes and Death are ſecretly lurking every where: It is in our Boſoms, in our Bowels, in every Thing we taſte, in every Thing we enjoy. We have Death dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with us in our Houſes, walking with us in the Fields, lying down with us in our Beds, and wrapp'd about us in our very Cloaths; always at Hand, ready at God's Command to give the fatal Blow. If Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven permits, <hi>Benhadad</hi> is ſlain in his Bed, and <hi>Amnon</hi> at his Table, <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> in his Cups, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Firſt-born in their Sleep, <hi>Saul</hi> in the Field, <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Senate, <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi> in the Theatre, <hi>Antiochus</hi> in his Coach, <hi>Zechariah</hi> in the Temple, <hi>Joab</hi> at the Altar, and Pope <hi>Victor</hi> at the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>The whole Hiſtory of ſudden Death, from known or unknown Cauſes, belongs to this Head, and inforces the Admonition of the wiſe Man; <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to Morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> Nay, it appears from theſe Surprizes, that thou knoweſt not what a Meal, a Mouthful, a Draught, a Step, a Moment, may bring forth; and therefore it is a ſenſeleſs as well as a graceleſs Thing, in a Time of Health, to ſuppoſe Sickneſs and Death to be always a great Way off.</p>

A meer Catalogue of Diſtempers, and of their ſingle Names, what a Volume does it make? Beſides thoſe for which as yet we have no Names at all.<note n="r" place="bottom">

What an Illuſtration of this Matter could ſome of the Faculty give us, even to Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? What an Army of Diſeaſes, if they were to be drawn out under theſe two diſtinct Heads, either of ſuch as belong to the <hi>Humonrs and Fluids,</hi> as Fever, Small-Pox, Dropſy, Jaundice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are diſtinct in their Nature, and frequently occur to Obſervation? And how commonly they are the Inſtruments of Death, the Weekly Bills are a perpetual Teſtimony. Then, if we ſhould deſcend into all the Sorts and Kinds of theſe Diſeaſes, that Account would be it ſelf a Volume. Or in the ſecond Place, the Diſeaſes of the <hi>Solids:</hi> And that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry ſhould be purſu'd in the Order the Animal OEconomy leads us; as firſt, a Fault in the Salivary Glands of the Mouth, or in thoſe of the Stomach, or in the Tone of the Stomach, or a vicious Biliary Secretion, are any of them ſufficient to prevent Digeſtion, and conſequently the Nouriſhment of the Body, which muſt end in Death.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, Obſtructions in the <hi>Lacteal Veins,</hi> or <hi>Thoracick Duct;</hi> Diſeaſed Lungs; not able to furniſh the Blood with Air. Large <hi>Polypuſes</hi> in the <hi>Heart,</hi> Veins, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; Obſtructions or Ruptures in the Blood Veſſels, or <hi>Lymphaticks;</hi> Excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Inflammations, or Impoſthumations, in
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:008869_0093_1030A41D1D8A64A8"/>
or about the Heart, Brain, or Liver: All which are one Time or other Cauſes of Death, and baffle the Skill of the beſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. To theſe we may add the Diſeaſes of the Nerves; which are certainly nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, though we have no very diſtinct Idea of them.</p>
                  <p>Under one or other of theſe Heads muſt we rank the Fevers that burn us, the Agues that ſhake us, the Small-Pox that poiſons the Blood, and turns us into Lazars; Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that drown and overflow us, the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice that pours out its baneful Suffuſion upon our Blood; the Stone that grinds, the Gout that tortures, the Convulſions that wrack the Nerves; Cholicks that tear and rend our Bowels, and immoderate Fluxes; the Phrenſies that unman us, the Epilepſies that fell us to the Ground.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe common and known Caſes, there are Thouſands of Diſorders that are wrapp'd up in general Names, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd under ſome ſingle Diſtempers above named, and whoſe very Symptoms are ſo many particular Diſtempers themſelves.</p>
                  <p>What Man now can enſure Life &amp; Health for a Day, when there are ſo many Ways of Attack, ſo many Shapes under which Sickneſs and Death may enter? Can I ſay, I ſhan't die to Day, when many that have thought
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:008869_0094_1030A4229576D7B0"/>
ſo have died the next Hour? Is there any Senſe in putting off the Thought of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Death merely becauſe we are well at preſent? Is it not a much better Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be able to think of it, though as a Thing near, without Diſturbance? By get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into ſuch a Condition as to Soul, Eſtate, and Affairs, as that a Man may ſay with himſelf; Well, now let Sickneſs and Death come when they will, I thank God I have nothing elſe to do but to obſerve them, to wait Orders, to compoſe my Soul to reſign chearfully, and my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall decently, and riſe gloriouſly; and in the mean Time, I'll enjoy my ſelf, and my God, and all the allowed Comforts of Life, with ſo much the greater Reliſh, as it is without the Hazard of Surprize, the Fear of Death, or the Danger of Damnation.</p>
                  <p>To think of Sickneſs and Death, does it bring them a Jot nearer to us? And on the other Hand, to baniſh all Thoughts of them, does it really ſet them a Moment farther off? When you are at Sea, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Sail making after you, you know not whether it be a Friend or the Enemy: Then you take up your <hi>Perſpective-Glaſs,</hi> and ſee what Colours, Built, and Aſpect they bear, and form a Judgment: If it be an Enemy, the Perſpective will not draw it

nearer to the Ship you are in, though it brings it nearer to View, and ſo enables you to diſcover whether it be ſo or no, and puts you into a better Poſture to receive them, let them be what they will. Sickneſs and Death are in full chaſe of us; if we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to think of them, we throw down the Perſpective, its true, and refuſe to know whether they are Friends or Foes; but are they ever the farther off for that?

III. This Conſideration of God's having the abſolute Power of Life and Death, <hi>gives a great deal of Force to all the Motives of Religion,</hi> and is a great means to preſerve it in the World.</p>
                  <p>To conſider,—The Object of my Worſhip is the Maſter of my Life and Health! Surely it concerns me to live to him by whom I live at all! 'Tis but for him to be diſpleaſed, and I die. He can ſtop my Breath the next bad Word I ſpeak. He that pronounced the Sentence of Death upon <hi>Adam</hi> and his Offspring for the firſt Act of Diſobedience; he that erected <hi>Lot'</hi>s Wife a Monument of the Folly of hanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after any Thing God commands us to abandon: He that ſtruck <hi>Uzzah</hi> with Death for his unbelieving Raſhneſs; <hi>Herod</hi> with Worms for his Vanity and Pride; and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with Diſtempers and Death for their prophaning the Lord's Supper: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſhould be careful to pleaſe, and afraid of offending one of ſuch Power; one that can wither the Hand that is put forth to Iniquity; can blaſt with Lightning the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Eye, or cloſe it in the Shades of Death in the very Turn of a luſtful Glance, as eaſily as he ſtruck dead <hi>Ananias</hi> with a Lie in his Mouth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:008869_0104_10308D39B0F12108"/>
None can bleſs me as God can bleſs me: Nor can any curſe me as God can. He can bleſs me ſo, as that all the Curſes in the World ſhall be but as throwing Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againſt a Rock: He can curſe me ſo, as that all the Bleſſings in the World ſhall be but ſo many loud and ſudden Wiſhes for a Man that is already fallen over a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice. <hi>Whom thou bleſſeſt, they are bleſſed indeed; and whom thou curſeſt, they are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How much Pain can he crowd into one ſingle Limb of the Body? Nay, into one Joint? Ay, into one ſingle Fibre? He can cauſe Bleſſings to deſcend upon me like Rain upon the tender Graſs, or pour down his Curſes upon me like a Storm, and take me away as with a Whirlwind. He can pluck the guilty Soul out of the wicked Body; and throw the one into the Grave, there to lie and rot, and the other into Hell, there to periſh for ever. <hi>O my Soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly, leſt he take thee away in his Anger, and there be none to deliver;</hi> leſt he let fly his Arrows into thy Breaſt, which will pierce like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and wound beyond all Recovery. Cleave to him, for he is thy Life; <hi>In his Right Hand is Length of Days, and in his Left Hand are Riches and Honour,</hi> to give of both to whom he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="unknown:008869_0105_10308D3B5CABB8C0"/>
This Thought puts a mighty Efficacy, I ſay, into all the Motives of Religion, the Calls of his Word, the Intreaties of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, the Motions of his Spirit, the Promiſes of Heaven, the Threats of Hell: For all theſe are the Inſtances and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of one who has the Power of my Health and Life, and can eaſily avenge himſelf of any Affront or Slight, of any Neglect or Delay, at the Coſt of one or both of theſe.</p>
                  <p>IV. Hereby God has it in his Power to <hi>bleſs or puniſh a great many at once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Happineſs of a great many is very often wrapp'd up in the Life and Health of one: And therefore 'tis not fit ſuch a Power ſhould be in the Hands of any other Being, but one of infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs. Providence often hangs many Weights upon one ſingle String, and when that breaks, all falls to the Ground at once. If we go into the Houſes of Mourning we ſhall ſee and hear moſt affecting Evidences of this from the diſconſolate Widow, the fatherleſs Children, the ſorrowful Friends; all have a long and mournful Story to tell, how much they have ſuffer'd in the Loſs of the Relation, or Friend, or uſeful Man; how much Buſineſs there is a Stop to; or on the other Hand, how many good Works
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:008869_0106_10308D3E33F116B0"/>
are now no more; and how many ſuffer by that Means, who depended upon him, or were the better for him. Theſe are Things of ſuch Conſequence in the World, that the Power of Life and Health ought to be only in the Hand 'tis in; and is too big a Truſt to be lodged with Angels or Men: I mean the abſolute Power over it, which can belong to none but God.</p>
                  <p>V. Life and Health <hi>are the Time of my Probation for Eternity, and therefore ought to be in no meaner Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mine eternal Happineſs or Miſery is wrapp'd up in this little Life of mine: If I die before I am fit to die, I am undone; and for that Reaſon I would not have the Power of my Life and Death, my Health and Sickneſs, in the Hand of any but the wiſe and good Governor of the World, for all the World. Who knows what Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Health or Sickneſs is fitteſt to work upon the Conſcience? Who knows ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well how to temper the Cup? What Sort and Meaſure of Ingredients to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, that may reach the Caſe, when to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and when to ſtop? If this Power were lodged in our Hands, we are ſuch poor Creatures, we ſhould hardly ever touch or afflict ſome, nor ſhould we ſpare others; we ſhould deal with too much Fondneſs, or
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:008869_0107_10308D3FE2523588"/>
too much Severity: There are ſome we would never ſuffer to be ſick, nor die; and there are others, whom we ſhould long ago have hurried out of the World, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to have made the ſame Uſe of them in it that God does. He only knows when the <hi>Veſſels of Wrath,</hi> that will not be cleanſed are <hi>fitted for Deſtruction,</hi> and have filled up the <hi>Meaſure of their Iniquity.</hi> And on the other Hand, he only knows the Caſe of every good Man, how far they are to be chaſtiſed, that they may not be <hi>condemned with the World:</hi> He knows when they have done all their Work for him, and when he has done all his Work in them, and <hi>fulfilled the good Pleaſure of his Will in them, and the Work of Faith with Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe Things were left to us, how would fond Relations ever know when 'twas fit to let go, and take Leave? What a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Partiality would there be in the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to the Wife, the Parent to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Child, and the Friend that is nearer than the Brother? However needful a Fit of Sickneſs was, it ſhould never come; and however fitted a good Man was for Heaven, he ſhould not be permitted to go: We ſhould not know when 'twas Time to retire, and take our Leave, or ſuffer our Friends to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>

VI. <hi>'Tis beyond any Skill but the Divine to order the coming into the World, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it, in ſuch a Proportion, both as to Numbers of Perſons, and Diſtance of Time, as may beſt agree with the needful Succeſſion of one Generation paſſing away, and another coming</hi> upon the Face of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>This requires great Skill to prevent Confuſion, Deficiency, or Superfoetation of human Race.—But how eaſy is all this to him, who declares his Concern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Matters vaſtly leſs than humane Life, <abbr>

                  <p>The Uſe that we ſhould make of ſuch a Truth as this, is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This accounts for ſome Things we can't tell what to make of in the Providence of God, about the Health and Life of ſome Perſons;</hi> that ſome weak Perſons ſhould live a long while, when others of a more healthy Conſtitution are cut off; that ſome pious, uſeful, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>great,</hi> though not a <hi>good</hi> Old Age. Some barren Trees are ſuffer'd to <hi>cumber the Ground</hi> a long Time, when others that are fruitful are tranſplanted into the Paradiſe of God, in Reward to themſelves, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the World that's left behind. Theſe are ſo much the leſs Riddles to us, when we conſider that the Power of Life and Death is in his Hand who is Wife and Good, <hi>and whoſe Thoughts are not as ours, nor does he ſee as Man ſees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>'Tis Matter of Comfort that my Health and Life is in ſo Wiſe and Good a Hand.</hi> It's of too great Importance both to me and others to have it any where elſe, for the Reaſons above mentioned. If Men are ſuffered to kill the Body, it's becauſe he ſuffers them, who has its Life in his Hand, and not they. 'Till he permits it I am immortal: All the Devils in Hell, all the Men in the World, all the Diſtempers in the Diſpenſary, all the Plagues and Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, Invaſions and Famines, that ever ſwept away their Millions from the Face of the Earth, ſhall not deſtroy my Life till they have his Commiſſion, whoſe Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive it is to <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>This aggravates the Sin of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and whatſoever tends to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis offering to take the Power of Life

and Death out of God's Hands, and in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to ſay, Such a one ſhall die <hi>when I pleaſe, I will kill,</hi> and <hi>I will make alive:</hi> Whereas, he only that can ſay, <hi>I make alive,</hi> ought to ſay, <hi>I kill.</hi> Self-Murder is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Attempt to ſnatch the Power of Life and Death out of God's Hand, and to ſay, I will die when <hi>I pleaſe,</hi> and will have this Power of Life and Death in my own Hand.</p>
                  <p>Again, This ſhould teach us <hi>not to fear Men ſo as to offend God;</hi> not only, as our Saviour ſays, becauſe <hi>they can only kill the Body,</hi> but becauſe they cannot ſo much as do that neither without God's Permiſſion, in whom alone is the Power of Life and Death; nay, and what's more, who can kill the Body as well as Men, and without the Hand of any Man. The Life I ſave by offending God, God can eaſily take away himſelf. If a Man ſay, I'll kill you unleſs you do this, or that, let me remember that God ſays, <hi>I kill, and I make alive;</hi> and alſo, that unleſs God permit, the Tyrant can't.</p>
                  <p>The Martyr was full of this Thought, who, when his Life was offer'd him upon Condition of his Recantation, anſwered, <hi>Though you don't take away my Life to Day, can you aſſure me that God won't do it to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? What ſignifies thus ſaving what I can't keep always, and can never better beſtow?</hi>
                  </p>

Again, This <hi>teaches us where we are to go for Health,</hi>

The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do not only pray to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels upon ordinary Occaſions, but have their, particular Saints to addreſs to upon particular Caſes, Diſeaſes, and Diſtreſſes: As, to St. <hi>Apollonia</hi> for the Tooth-ach; to St. <hi>Anthony</hi> for Inflammations, that are from thence called St. <hi>Anthony's Fire,</hi> a Sort of Inflammation, for the Cure of which they uſed to pray to St. <hi>Anthony;</hi> to St. <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> for Fevers and Agues; and to St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> for removing the Plague; to St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> for Dangers at Sea; and a great many other Caſes like theſe.</p>
                  <p>But dare any of theſe Saints preſume to ſpeak ſuch Words as theſe, <hi>I kill, and I make alive?</hi> Is Health and Life in their Power? Do they wound and heal, that they ſhould be addreſſed to for Things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Gift of God? If God be willing to heal, and make alive, why do they not directly go to him?

                  <p>A Time of Health is the <hi>beſt Time,</hi> and it may be the <hi>only Time</hi> of preparing for Death; for, may not I be cut off by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Death in an unprepared State? Or, may not I be ſeized with a Diſtemper that may as ſuddenly ſnatch away the uſe of my Reaſon, and ſo be derived of a Capacity of preparing for Death? The Diſorders of Sickneſs, do they not generally unfit for ſuch Actions of Mind as are neceſſary to Preparation? Is it not next to impoſſible, that long Cuſtoms in Sin ſhould be changed at once, and that inveterate Habits that have taken deep Root in the Soul, ſhould be plucked up at once? Tho' we <hi>limit not the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael, yet we muſt regard his own Repreſentation of this Matter, as next to an Impoſſibility, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his</hi>

And farther ſtill, the Goſpel does ſo plainly require Holineſs of Heart and Life, the <hi>Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> the <hi>putting off the</hi>
                     <pb n="119" facs="unknown:008869_0130_10308D7F06333050"/>
                     <hi>Old Man, putting on the New,</hi> the <hi>walking after the Spirit</hi> (things that do not lye mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Turn of Thought, or a ſudden Change of Mind) that ſome have been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to imagine, all that can be done upon a Death Bed too late, if nothing have been done before; and that the Caſe of one who has rejected the Offers of Grace all his Life-time, is deſperate upon a Death Bed, let his Convictions or Pretenſions be what they will; and that a forced Repentance in this Extremity, can't come up to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Goſpel Terms of Salvation. The Love of Sin was in its full Strength to the very Time they took their Beds; 'tis Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that has taken off the Appetite, not Grace, and ſo they have not left their Sins, but their Sins have left them. As to thoſe called at the <hi>eleventh Hour,</hi> that's far from being the Caſe here, becauſe they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called before, as you have been all your Life. They obeyed the firſt Call, tho' it came at the <hi>eleventh Hour,</hi> whereas you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the heavenly Call at preſent, in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption upon an after Game, which very Preſumption is a Provocation to God not to give you then the Opportunity, the Means, or the Grace of Converſion.</p>
                  <p>The ſame may be ſaid with reſpect to the Thief upon the Croſs, which ſo many abuſe

to a Purpoſe, miſerably wide from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſo illuſtrious an Act of Grace. For, that was not only an extraordinary thing in it ſelf, and conſequently no more to be drawn into ordinary Application, than a Man ſhould expect to be fed by Ravens, in neglect of his lawful Calling, becauſe he has read that <hi>Elijah</hi> was ſo; but alſo, it muſt be obſerved, that this was (very likely) the firſt Call to Chriſtianity he ever had: He was not, it may be, one of thoſe <hi>loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> to whom Chriſt and his Apoſtles directed their firſt Addreſs of the Goſpel; but, as ſhould ſeem, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Manner of his Execution, was a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and had now, firſt of all, met with Chriſt, and now firſt of all called by him; and what's this to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of thoſe who live in a conſtant Slight of the Calls of the Grace and Word of God, upon the ſecret Hope of complying at laſt, which is the deſperate Preſumption of thoſe who quote this Inſtance to their own Deſtruction?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="unknown:008869_0132_10308D8629B6C988"/>
This may ſuffice to ſhew how <hi>wiſe</hi> a Thing it is to <hi>conſider our latter End,</hi> in a Time of Health; the next Thing is to engage Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be ſo wiſe as this comes to.</p>
                  <p>This is a Thing of that Importance that it ought to be a little enlarged upon; but then 'tis a Thing People are wond'rous ſhy of; they take the State of Health &amp; Vigour to be given for nothing but Enjoyment, Pleaſure, or Buſineſs; as for thinking of the latter End, it's time enough when we come to be ſick, that is to ſay, the greateſt Bleſſing of Life is given for every Thing but the main Thing for which it is given, <hi>providing for Sickneſs and Death;</hi> and it is time enough to do that, at that Time, when it is next to impoſſible it ſhould be done at all; it is time enough to prepare for a Thing when the Thing has ſurpriſed us unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
                  <p>Let not the healthful Perſon be frighted at the Words, <hi>Preparing for Sickneſs and Death;</hi> they mean nothing but what is the moſt friendly and delightful in the World, namely, Pleaſure, Peace, and Safety; it does not ſignify, that you muſt think of nothing elſe but your latter End it does not oblige
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:008869_0133_10308D8B54DBDFD0"/>
you to ſleep in a <hi>Winding Sheet,</hi> to lye down every Night in a <hi>Coffin,</hi> and always have a <hi>Death's Head</hi> upon the Cabinet; but it will ſet you above the Weakneſs of counting even theſe Things Melancholy.</p>
                  <p>It will render thoſe Thoughts familiar to you that are the Dread of Mankind, and take off the Horror of the moſt horrible Thing to human Nature; horrible, merely becauſe in Time of Health we will not make our ſelves acquainted with it.</p>
                  <p>They who are put upon preparing for Sickneſs and Death, and anſwer, <hi>What, muſt we be always thinking of theſe Things?</hi> They know in their Conſcience, that is not the Thing God or Man means by it; they know 'tis an impertinent Evaſion, and objecting againſt what no body ſuppoſes: No Body ſuppoſes you muſt always be thinking of it, but you would, by your good Will, never think of it at all, even tho' you don't ſo much as pretend to eſcape it; which is the meaneſt Folly, and moſt ſordid Lowneſs of Soul that can be deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>By conſidering our latter End, God does not require that we ſhould be inconſiderate about our temporal Affairs; there is no Quarrel againſt this forethought upon this Account. Take your Time for Buſineſs and Diverſion too, only let them not have
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:008869_0134_10308D8CFA2D1100"/>
all your Health and Time. There is no need to ſet at Odds thoſe Things that may and do very well agree, Buſineſs and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Trade for both Worlds, Earth and Heaven, the Health and Proſperity of both Parts, Body and Soul; theſe may very well be carried on together, and be render'd friendly and helpful to each other. We may be Chriſtians without turning <hi>Hermits,</hi> and muſt overcome this World not by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring out of it, but by bringing the other World down into it. The Affairs of this World have an allowed Place in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; the Buſineſs is, to make them know and keep their Place; as the Church is repreſented, not ſhut up from the World, above it; the World under her Feet, but her Head above the Clouds, <hi>cloathed with the Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon under her Feet,</hi> and upon <hi>her Head a Crown of twelve Stars.</hi> Rev. 12. 1. If we uſe the World ſo as not to abuſe it, if we live in it, as thoſe who are not of it, and make that Mammon, which is the World's God, to be with us God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and our Aſſiſtant, and ſo preſs this World into the Service of the other, we anſwer that Repreſentation.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it ſuch a Poring upon approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sickneſs &amp; Death as ſhould in any wiſe <hi>deſtroy the Comforts of Life,</hi> but rather heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:008869_0135_10308D8EA6E2E520"/>
and improve them: If you are not able to think of Sickneſs and Death without a Blaſt upon all your Comfort, and the Tho't imbitters every thing, that very Thing proves it to be high Time for you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Matter; for, what a Condition muſt you be in, or what ſort of Pleaſures muſt they be, that are not able to bear the Thoughts of your latter End? There is not a Pleaſure a Chriſtian need meddle withal, but what will bear the Thought, and be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by it too, with this additional Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, unknown to the Inconſiderate, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> 
                     <hi>My Pleaſures can bear, not only the Thought of Death, but the Thing it ſelf; it can overtake me in them without my Ruin:</hi> Lord! is not this an happy Condition? But of this more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, I ſhall explain this laſt Direction and Duty a little farther in the following Particulars. If I would make the beſt Uſe poſſible of my Health, &amp; conſider my latter End to Purpoſe, I muſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> think of it <hi>frequently,</hi> till it grows a familiar and an eaſy Thought, as it will do to a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>This will gradually remove the Dread and Horror that attends an unconſider'd Trial. Monſters of <hi>Africk</hi> are not terrible to their Keepers, becauſe they are always with them;
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:008869_0136_10308D92A7A99C38"/>
the Dread wears off as the Eye becomes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the Object. I lye down at Night, ſtretch out my ſelf, and take it for granted, I am bidding the World farewel. I have bleſſed my Family, and compoſed my concern'd Friends to a willing Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The vital Knot is untying, ſuppoſe; I am but a little Way from the Preſence of God, the Seat of his Judgment, and his Glory. Well, what is it now that hinders my enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pleaſure of this Thought? I am upon the Borders of Immortality and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, what is it makes me ſhrink &amp; hang back? What am I defective in? Now, whatever I find, that would ſpoil the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſuch a Seaſon, let me ſet my ſelf to repent of thoſe Sins, to mortify thoſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, to obtain that Grace, and ſecure thoſe Meaſures of Faith, Hope, and Love, of Spirituality, and Evidence for Heaven, as may enable me to think of dying into Immortality and Perfection, with all the Pleaſure that becomes the near Approach of perfect Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I die daily,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, that's the Way to die ſafely and pleaſantly. They that will not bear the Thoughts of this while they are well, will find it hard to look Death in the Face when they are not able to avoid it; when he that has often thought the
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:008869_0137_10308D9577E8C268"/>
Matter over, meets it as an Acquaintance, as a known Thing, a Thing he has often acted over with himſelf, and ſo puts himſelf into the beſt Preparation for doing it in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality: He is able to conſider Death, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Sting in it, nor Curſe belonging to it, and conſequently no Hell following it; he looks at it under more agreeable Notions, as it is a parting with Corruption, dropping Mortality, ceaſing to Sin, to ſuffer, or to die; entering the aſſured State of unalterable, Bleſſedneſs, <hi>Immortality and eternal Life,</hi> that inſtead of groaning at the Thoughts of it, they can ſometimes with the Apoſtle, <hi>groan to be uncloathed, in order to be cloathed upon, to be diſſolved and be with Chriſt, which is far better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt be owned, there are ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of ſuch a Make, that double the Share of Grace they have, would not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them to the Thoughts of dying, tho' they may have Grace enough to render their Death ſafe, they may not have enough to render the Fore-thought of it pleaſant to them, but like ſome timorous Perſons, ſhrink at the Sight of a Gun tho' it be not charged, and tremble at a naked Sword, thô it be in the Hand of a Friend they know will do them no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>arm. To ſuch I would only ſay at preſent, that frequent thinking
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:008869_0138_10308D984C392298"/>
on your latter End, acting over the Scene of your Farewel to the World, ſtating your Accounts with God, and placing your ſelf at his Bar, and clearing your Intereſt in your <hi>Advocate,</hi> at the ſame Time you preſent your ſelf before your Judge; this will by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees wear off that unpleaſant Averſion, which, of it ſelf, ought to give us more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, than the Thoughts of dying, leſt that Averſion ſhould continue me unprepared, as, to be ſure I ſhall be, if I never think of the Matter.</p>
                  <p>And not only for our own Comfort, but we ought ſo far to conſult the <hi>Honour of Religion,</hi> and the Glory of Chriſt, who has delivered us from the <hi>Second Death,</hi> as to endeavour to overcome the Fears of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> to deliver us from which, was one Branch of his Redemption, and one Deſign of his Conqueſt; for as he came to <hi>deſtroy him that had the Power of Death,</hi> ſo he came to <hi>deliver thoſe, who thro' Fear of Death have been all their Life times ſubject to Bondage.</hi> Was this Freedom one thing Chriſt died to procure, and is it not my Duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obtain it? Is it not very odd, for a Chriſtian to ſay, my Converſation, Hope and Happineſs is in Heaven, but as for going thither, I dread and abhor the Thoughts on't.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="unknown:008869_0139_10308D9B22FA4110"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> to think wiſely of our latter End, <hi>is to act under the Influence of ſuch Thoughts while we are in Health, as thoſe that know they ſhall not be always ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To think of our latter End, would be but a ſorry Direction, if to think of it was all, without acting in a conſtant Reference to it, and under the Influence of it: If our Preparation goes no farther than Thoughts and Purpoſes, the Fruits of eternal Life pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the Bloſſom; it does not ſo much lye in poring upon the <hi>Memento's</hi> of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, an Hour-glaſs, Coffin, Tombs, a Death's Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in acting upon the Concluſions, which theſe things ſuggeſt; as thus, <hi>The end of all Things is at hand,</hi> therefore let us <hi>watch and be ſober; the Night comes wherein no Man can work,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>let me work out my Salvation with Fear and Trembling, therefore let me work the Works of him that ſent me while it is called to Day?</hi> Time is ſhort, Health is uncertain; ſhort and uncertain as they are, my Eternity depends upon them, therefore will I keep my Eye upon my Glaſs, and wiſely obſerve how faſt my Sands do run, how ſoon they will be out, how eaſily my Glaſs may be broke, even before my Sands are out.</p>
                  <p>Again, to act under the Influence of ſuch Thoughts, is to think with my ſelf, <hi>how</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="unknown:008869_0140_10308D9D170F0BB0"/>

                        </gap> look when I come to be ſick and die?</hi> When I come to review it upon a ſick and dying Bed? I ſee how it looks now, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, delightful, promiſing, entertaining, and ſeems allowable; but may I truſt its Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Will it not have another Aſpect when I am forced to review it upon a ſick &amp; dying Bed? When every thing will appear in a very different Manner from what it does now, thro' the falſe Colours of Prejudice, Partiality and Self-Indulgence. How will Holineſs then look, compared with Sin? The Favour of God compared with ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Loſs of it? Reſiſting Temptation compar'd with yielding to it? How will it look then, to have nobly conquer'd by Self-denyal, or to have meanly yielded thrô Self-indulgence? Heaven, Hell, this World, and the other, the Goſpel Promiſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, and the Excuſes, Shifts and Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions we have uſed, how will they then look, either to the wiſe Chriſtian, or to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened Sinner? For want of living under the Influence of this Fore-ſight, ſome who have ſlept under the moſt affecting Calls of the Goſpel, have awaked at once from their ſecure Dream into the utmoſt Confuſion. Upon a ſick Bed, when Things began to appear juſt as they were, then, the Folly of Sin! the Wiſdom of Holineſs! the Wiſdom particularly of this Part of Holineſs I am
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:008869_0141_10308DA2492D3A58"/>
now recommending, of improving Health to the beſt Purpoſes, and acting under the Influence of this Proſpect of our latter End, then it will appear in fulleſt Evidence and Luſtre!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now,</hi> (ſays the ſurpriſed Soul) <hi>I ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this World is not what I took it for: Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, Reſt, and Happineſs! Lord! what have I been doing? that ever I ſhould ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, what 'twas impoſſible I ſhould avoid, and baniſh from my Thoughts, what I find will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways come too ſoon to thoſe who think on it leaſt? Oh! Why could not I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with allowed Pleaſures? Now I fully ſee, God's Allowance was always ſufficient; and to exceed that, was needleſs Folly, as well as impudent Diſobedience; 'twas like getting up from a well-ſpread Table, to cram down Poiſon in ſecret, meerly becauſe 'was forbidden Fruit; or at leaſt, becauſe it was ſweet. Now I can ſee no Senſe in thoſe Excuſes and Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, which I before thought wondrous witty and cunning. Lord! where was my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that I ſhould venture my Soul upon a ſlight Turn of Thought, againſt ſuch a deal of Evidence that I was in the wrong? But I would not ſuffer my ſelf to think; or if I did, I labour'd to place Matters in ſuch a View as has deceiv'd me, and undone me. A little Fore-thought might have prevented the dire</hi>

                     <hi>Confuſion of this Hour. I might have been looking upward, through an open Heaven, to a ſmiling God: I might have been adorn'd with the Grandeurs of a Chriſtian breathing after Immortality, inſtead of the Horrors of a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner: But when I need Comfort moſt, the Things about me, that I made my Truſt, can yield me none: And God, who only can, is departed from me: Satan buſy about me, as an Executioner about a Malefactor! What then?—No Angel to take Care of my Soul? No God to ſmile upon a dying Creature? Muſt I never ſee Chriſt Jeſus in the Form of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer more?—No, no more in the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>It was the Saying of a grave Divine, that <hi>he wonder'd how any Man could dye in his Wits, that did not dye in Faith: And that their Souls did not leave their Bodies, as the Devil left the Body of the</hi> Demoniacs, <hi>rending and tearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again; To live under the Influence of the Thought of our latter End, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>How if this Action ſhould cloſe my Life, and be my laſt?</hi> How would it look to loſe my Life with ſuch an Action as this? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

thing that it is fit for us to have, and allowable to do, or enjoy, will bear ſuch a Thought as this. All becoming Pleaſures, all lawful Buſineſs will ſubſiſt, ay, and thrive and ſweeten under ſuch a Thought as this, and not be blaſted by it. If any Buſineſs or Pleaſure can be ſpoiled by this Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either that is not good, or we are not in a good Condition; and which ſoever it be, it's time that ſomething give way to ſettle a Queſtion of ſo great Importance; whatſoever will not bear this Thought, is to be ſuſpected, ſtopp'd &amp; examin'd: That cannot be good it ſelf, that is ſhy of, and won't agree with, ſuch good Company, as the Thoughts of God, and another World.</p>
                  <p>If in my Conſcience I know that this is my lawful Buſineſs, or this a fit Recreation for needful Health, or allow'd Enjoyment, I may venture to dye in that Diverſion or Buſineſs. I ſay, <hi>venture</hi> to dye in it. For it's one thing, indeed, what a good Man may <hi>venture</hi> or dare to do, it's another thing, what he would <hi>chuſe</hi> to do. A good Man may <hi>venture</hi> to dye in drinking a Glaſs of Wine at a Feaſt, or in taking a Walk, or riding out, though he would not <hi>chuſe</hi> to do ſo, it being deſirable to do ſo great a Work in the beſt Order, and with ſome ſuitable Compoſure: But then there are ſome Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:008869_0144_10308DA8CE301098"/>
in which a good Man would not ſo much as venture to die, no nor live neither, in Actions or Pleaſures that will not ſtand the Preſence of good Thoughts, Thoughts of God, and of dying into his immediate Preſence in the Act; they have not War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or Allowance enough to bear the Thought, that when our Lord comes, he <hi>ſhould find us ſo doing.</hi>

He is the Man that lives well, He underſtands the Art of living and dying too, both for the Pleaſure and Safety of it, who can in all his Actions ſay, <hi>If God pleaſes, let this be my laſt;</hi> I could <hi>venture</hi> it, tho' I would not <hi>chuſe</hi> it; who behaves as if every Day and Action were to cloſe his Life, not with ſo much Solemnity and Concern as if he certainly knew he muſt

die to Day, for that would ſpoil the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Affairs and Pleaſures of Life, but with equal Reſpect to the Righteouſneſs and Holineſs of all he does, and ſo, as would render the dying it ſelf uncumber'd with any Diſturbance that ſhould be trouble ſome or unbecoming.</p>
                  <p>To this I may add, that to act under the Influence of the foreſight of our latter End, is to think with our ſelves, <hi>How does God look upon this that I do?</hi> What Opinion has he of it? What does his Word ſay about it? The Judgment of God is according to Truth, and every thing is right that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that. We ſhall all be of his Mind ſooner or later; 'tis Wiſdom to be as near it now as we can; for, as to be like God is the higheſt Perfection of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to enjoy God the higheſt Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city we are capable of, ſo to be of the ſame Mind with him, is the higheſt Wiſdom and Prudence; to ſee things in his Light, and look upon them with Sentiments conform to his unerring Mind. Thus have I ſhewn what it is to act under the Influence of the foreſight of our latter End; it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how this Action will look when we come to be ſick and die: How if it ſhould be our laſt, and cloſe our Lives? How does God look upon it, what Opinion has he of
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:008869_0146_10308DAFA50802D0"/>
it, and what does his Word ſay about it? Which is to be the Rule of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> No Man can think wiſely of his latter End, that does <hi>not endeavour to get all things ready for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all other Caſes this is accounted Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to have Matters in Readineſs, not only to prevent the Danger of Delay, but the uncomfortable Hurries, Confuſions and Diſtractions of a Man ſurpriſed and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; if it be but a Journey of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or a Cauſe to be tryed, eſpecially of Life and Death, a Man would not be able to lift up his Head under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We have already ſhewn the Reaſon of this, when we proved, that the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Health is ſo great a Wonder. Your own Obſervation of the ſudden Deaths of ſo many Perſons, that ſeemed to die in Health, may farther convince you that it is not to be depended upon.

                  <p>This is a Matter that adds infinite Weight and Importance to the Buſineſs of dying, and conſequently ſets an unſpeakable Value upon our time &amp; Health, upon the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which our everlaſting Happineſs or Miſery depends.

I ſhall conclude this Section with theſe two Remarks: The Firſt, That <hi>as eaſy as this Matter ſeems to be, this Wiſdom is very rarely attained.</hi> And ſecondly, That <hi>where this Conſideration is practiſed, it ſpoils neither Buſineſs nor Pleaſure, but is a great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are but <hi>few that attain this Wiſdom of conſidering their latter End.</hi> Not one thing in the World is more univerſally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on than this, that <hi>we</hi> muſt alſo in <hi>our Turn,</hi> be ſick and die. It's a Jeſt to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove what no Body denies; and yet not one thing of all that concerns us, is ſo little conſidered! Such a Witchcraft there is in the World, that People can't abide to hear they muſt one time let it go. Buſy, like ſo many Ants about a Mole-hill, they take no Notice of the Foot that's juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cruſh them: Like <hi>Archimedes,</hi> ſo intent upon drawing his Schemes, that the Sword was in his Bowels, before he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the City was taken, and the Enemy was near him. Such is the Love, the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Love of preſent Pleaſures which they won't ſuffer to be mingled with a Thought of Death, 'tis daſhing Wormwood into their merry Cups.</p>

Matters to Rights between God and their Soul. Sometimes it is a ſecret Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that their Eſtate is bad, that keeps them from looking into it, as they that run behind hand in the World, do not care to look into their Books, and as Children in the dark are afraid to open their Eyes, leſt they ſhould ſee ſomething; but even thoſe very Children know, that they are never the ſafer for ſhutting their Eyes. Is it poſſible for any to imagine, that by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our latter End, we do really haſten and invite it? And that to make a Will, is ominous and foreboding? <hi>I give my Soul to God, and my Body to the Grave:</hi> Theſe Words are dreadful to a Man that does not know what God will do with his Soul; to a Man that never gave his Soul and Body to God before; to a Man that is afraid God will take him at his Word, and really take the Soul and Body that he ſurrenders: It ſounds like a Paſſing-Bell. They deſire to be excuſed ſuch melancholy Things. But is it not really a much more melancholy thing, to find your ſelf in ſuch a ſorry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as to dread the Thought, &amp; baniſh the Conſideration, when you cannot avoid the <hi>Thing?</hi> To think of Death cannot bring it nearer, but never to think of it, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make it come too ſoon, though it be an hundred Year hence.</p>

In the next Place, I ſay, <hi>theſe Thoughts with a Chriſtian need ſpoil neither Buſineſs nor Pleaſure.</hi> I ſhould rather wonder how any thing could be pleaſant till theſe Matters are ſettled.

And finally, as to thy Fears, whoſe Fault is it that thou haſt any thing to fear after Death, any thing that ſhould make you unwilling to think of it in Health?

                  <p>THE Dread of Sickneſs is a Diſtemper of it ſelf, and the next Diſpoſition to many more. What a Bondage does this keep ſome People in? The very Fear of a <hi>Climacterick,</hi> has killed ſome that knew not how groundleſs ſuch a Fear was.

think themſelves into Diſeaſes, what it is that diſpoſes the Body to receive ſome kind of Infection the ſooner for the Fears of it, I leave to others to explain; while I take notice of ſome Inſtances of this Fear that have done the Buſineſs as well. There's one ſo afraid of being ill, that he would not ſtir out of Doors, and for want of Air and Exerciſe, he contracts a Diſtemper that kills him. Another you ſhall ſee tampering with preventive Phyſic, till by endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to prevent imaginary Diſtempers, he dies of real ones: according to the <hi>Italian</hi> Epitaph upon one who died this way,

                     <p>The Fear of Death often proves mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and ſets People on Methods to ſave their Lives, which infallibly deſtroy them. This is a Reflection made by ſome Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, upon obſerving that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more thouſands kill'd in a Flight than in a Battel, and may be applied to thoſe multitudes of Imaginary ſick Perſons, that break their Conſtitution by Phyſic, and throw themſelves into the Arms of Death, by endeavouring to eſcape it. This Method is not only dangerous, but below the Practice of a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To conſult the Preſervation of Life, as the only End of it, to make our Health our Buſineſs, to engage in no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is not part of a Regimen, or Courſe of Phyſic, are Purpoſes ſo abject, ſo mean, ſo unworthy human Nature, that a generous Soul would rather die than ſubmit to them. Beſides, that a continual Anxiety for Life, vitiates all the Reliſhes of it, and caſts a Gloom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole Face of Nature; as it is impoſſible we ſhould take delight in any thing that we are every Moment afraid of loſing.<note n="d" place="bottom">Spectat.

I do not mean (continues that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Writer, full to my purpoſe) by what I have here ſaid, that I think any one to blame for taking Care of his Health. On the contrary, as Chearfulneſs of Mind, and Capacity for Buſineſs, are in a great meaſure the Effects of a well-temper'd Conſtitution, a Man cannot be at too much Pains to cultivate and preſerve it. But this Care which we are prompted to, not only by common Senſe, but by Duty and Inſtinct, ſhould never engage us in groundleſs Fears, melancholy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and imaginary Diſtempers, which are natural to every Man who is more anxious to live than How to live.

Again: Phyſicians ſay, <q>That in the Time of Infection 'tis neceſſary <hi>to uſe Cordials, and keep up the Spirits to a joyful Pitch,</hi> for that which keeps the Heart chearful and merry, is of notable Uſe againſt Contagion.</q> This, we have already ſeen, is one Fruit of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And truſting in God will rear it up to its Exaltation and Triumph, to <hi>Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory;</hi> which a <hi>Stranger</hi> to this good Conſcience, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, <hi>intermeddles not with.</hi> And thus we have conſider'd how a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a Preſervative of Health, as a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Means.</p>

It is certain, let a Man be never ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, he muſt be ſick and die, as well as the reſt of his Neighbours: But the Truth we advance by theſe Scriptures, is this, that Religion and a good Conſcience, as it has a <hi>natural</hi> Tendency to Health, in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner treated of above, ſo it has a <hi>Moral</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with it, made by the Promiſe of God and the Influence of his Providence, which keeps off Diſeaſes longer, or allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates them when they do come, ſupports us under them, and prevents even their worſt Extremity, <hi>dying to our Loſs.</hi> Whereas, if we live to our ſelves, the Devil, the World, and Luſt, to no Purpoſe, or a vile One, we provoke God to cut us off in the Midſt of our Days; or whenever he does it, to our Deſtruction.

                  <p>THE Government of the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> is a great part of practical Religion, as well as a good Direction in Phyſic. 'Tis a Preſervative from Sin, as well as from Diſeaſe, and without it, there can be neither Religion nor Health. The Seat of the Paſſions, and of Health, are ſo much the ſame: <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> the Blood and Spirits, that they muſt have a near Relation to, and Influence upon each other. The Perturbation of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt affect both. It's all one if the Sediment be raiſed, whether it be by Agitation from without, or Fermentation within; if our <hi>Paſſions</hi> which have their Seat in the Blood and Spirits, be not under Government, it is impoſſible for thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and that Blood, to be in their natural State.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Paſſions</hi> are compared to the Winds
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:008869_0196_10308E3E6737AC40"/>
in the Air, which when gentle and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, let them fill the Sail, and they will carry the Ship on ſmoothly to the deſired Port; but when violent, unmanageable, and boiſterous, it grows to a Storm, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Ruin and Deſtruction of all.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Paſſions</hi> of the Mind range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under theſe two, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Auger,</hi> which the Schools diſtinguiſh by the Name of the <hi>Concupiſcible</hi> and the <hi>Iraſcible;</hi> all of them <hi>Murderers from the Beginning,</hi> as it was ſaid of him who firſt raiſed and armed them againſt ourſelves and our God.</p>
                  <p>It would look too remote to charge them with the firſt Introduction of all Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Death, and yet it is ſo true, that I can't omit ſaying, that there had never been any Diſeaſes or Death at all in the World, had the Paſſions of Man been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned as they ought to have been. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and eager Deſire, Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have rival'd Plagues and Peſtilences, and all the Diſeaſes put together, for the Deſolation wherewith they have filled the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paſſions</hi> in their Violence are themſelves Diſtempers, have the proper Symptoms, and are the Occaſion of many more. Luſt is a <hi>Fever</hi> in its ſelf, beſides the Diſeaſes of other Names, that are in its Retinue.

Envy, Pride, Anger, inordinate Grief, Fears, Hopes, Deſires, Joys in their Exceſs, have been mortal, have done the Work of Sword and Poiſon, as well as of Diſeaſes, and that not only in their long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and diſtant Conſequences, but in their immediate Influence.</p>
                  <p>Exceſs of <hi>Admiration</hi> may fix the animal Spirits ſo immoderately in the Brain, as to hinder their uſual Influx into the other Parts of the Body.</p>
                  <p>Immoderate <hi>Deſire,</hi> what Languiſhings and Pinings does it create, as well as too eager Hopes?

                  <p>There are modern Stories too of ſome, to whom exceſſive Joy has been fatal. The Dilatation of the Heart, and the Diſcharge of Blood and Spirits, thereby is ſo great, that the Seat and Center of Life is left abandon'd, the Blood and Spirits are not able to recover themſelves Time enough, and return to their former Station, or elſe Life is drowned by their too violent Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into their Chanels: There is an Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in ſome Parts while there is a Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in others.</p>

                  <p>I am of Opinion, that there are no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies incident to our Bodies, but the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God hath provided Remedies or Alleviations for them, that lie in ſome Part of the Creation or other.

as ſecret Treaſures lie hid in the Bowels of Mountains, which would have been for ever ſecret, but for Induſtry or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſo there are Treaſures of Health and Relief, lodged in the animal, vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and mineral Kingdoms, that had never been diſcovered but by Induſtry or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be owned, to the Mortification of the Pride of Man, that ſome of the nobleſt Things in Phyſic are owing merely to providential Diſcovery; but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, it muſt alſo be allowed, that the ſame good Providence has bleſſed the Induſtry of ſome Perſons in the Knowledge of Diſtempers, and Methods of their Cure, and in purſuing Experiments to ſome very uſeful and excellent Purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>It is true, we are not to depend entirely upon the Phyſician, nor muſt we neglect him. <hi>We live not by Bread alone, but by the Word out of God's Mouth,</hi> and yet, if we refuſe our Food, we ſtarve.

queſtion whether they who ſtudy the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures an Properties of Things, with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our Make and Fame, muſt not know more of it than others.

                  <p>Nature will certainly very much help it ſelf, and Art will very much help Nature; and the Intention of Art is to aſſiſt Nature againſt what is unnatural, to ſupply where it is wanting, to remove Obſtructions, to eaſe it of any Load or Burthen, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its own Forces and Operations.

            <p>THUS have I gone through this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Health. My chief Deſign in it was to increaſe our <hi>Value</hi> for the Bleſſing, to direct how to avoid the <hi>Sins</hi> of it, and to aſſiſt towards the beſt Improvement of it, in the <hi>Duties</hi> that belong to it. Above all, that we loſe not ſo happy an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity as a Time of Health, to ſecure Bleſſings that are beyond even Health it ſelf; eternal Health and Pleaſure, both of Body and Mind!</p>
            <p>If any ſay that ſome Perſons, who pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe all theſe Things we call Preſervatives, do yet ſicken and die as well as others, and ſome that mind none of them are healthful: I anſwer;</p>

               <pb n="218" facs="unknown:008869_0229_1030903E5FF88E18"/>
We have all along allowed for Caſes of Reſerve in the Divine Providence, which often over-rules even the moſt natural Connexions and Tendencies, and diſpoſes them in a Method beſide and above the Diſcourſes of Mens Reaſon.</p>
            <p>The ſame Obſervation may be made on thoſe Preſervatives that are purely Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal. They themſelves do not always reach the Intention, and anſwer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. It is not the Pretence either of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity or Medicine, to give Immortality to Men in this Life, tho' the Preſcriptions of both may have a Tendency to Health and Welfare.</p>
            <p>Some, who mind all theſe Preſervatives, ſicken and die! Granted; but ſo do they who eat and drink, exerciſe and change the Air, and uſe the beſt Phyſic; and yet, who ever deny'd thoſe to be Preſervatives of Health and Life? Food, Phyſic, Exerciſe, and Air, will be Means of Health to the End of the World; and yet <hi>'tis appointed for Men once to die,</hi> and 'tis appointed to Man to uſe theſe Means of Life &amp; Health. They are both appointed.</p>
            <p>I have endeavour'd to make this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as practical as I could, and to order the Matter ſo, as to make the Thoughts about bodily Health, as uſeful as I could
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:008869_0230_103090413AE73558"/>
to the Proſperity of the better Part. I ſhall cloſe all with three Words.</p>
            <p>Take <hi>Care</hi> of your Health, ſince it is ſo valuable. Make the <hi>moſt</hi> of it, ſince it is ſo uncertain and frail. Long, pray for, and endeavour the enſuring of that State and World, where there is Health with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sickneſs! Eternal Health, without the leaſt <hi>Shadow of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Take Care of it, ſince it is ſo <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Diſplay of the Value and Bleſſing of Health ſhall make Men a little more careful of it, and more thankful for it, and more uſeful with it; it will add ſomething to the Benefit and Advantage of Mankind, and the Glory of God; the only Purpoſes of Life, that can give a true Reliſh to our Being.</p>
            <p>Think of the Miſeries of Sickneſs once more, and if you remember what paſſed when you were ill your ſelves, or have obſerved how it is in thoſe that are ſo. What Confinement, what Cloſeneſs! how far, how quickly removed from Buſineſs and Pleaſures the Heart before was ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A Man is dead to the World, before he dies out of it. Thoſe very Senſes which before took in all their Delight, are now the Inlets of Sadneſs and Offence. The

               <hi>Sight</hi> of his <hi>Medicine</hi> is ungrateful to the Eye. So is the <hi>Smell</hi> of his Meat.

            <p>Conſider farther the Difficulty of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, with the Hazards and Uncertainty of Phyſic.</p>
            <p>It is a very eaſy Matter to loſe our Health, but not ſo to recover it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever uſeful Phyſic is, 'tis not infallible. It muſt be uſed, but may not be depended upon. It's greateſt Maſters have called it<note n="q" place="bottom">Hipp. Aph. §. 9.</note>

We are willing to endure ſome painful Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Recovery of an uncertain Health, in this World; now Sickneſs and Death are to be looked upon only as ſome painful Operation we are to go through, and then <hi>all is well.</hi> The Head that is once crowned with Glory, ſhall never ach more. The Eye that is once open'd upon the beatific Viſion, ſhall never weep more. The Hand that has once laid hold of eternal Life, ſhall never tremble more. Everlaſting Health &amp; Vigour, Youth, Life, and Proſperity, both of Soul and Body, after a ſmall Separation, belong to the Paradiſaical Conſtitution, and are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of that Place <hi>where the Inhabitant ſhall not ſay I am ſick, for the People that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their Iniquity.</hi>
