            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING MY DEAR FRIEND AND COUSIN MARY MOLLINEUX, DECEASED, In a living Remembrance of the Benefit which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by her Labour of Love; and now recommend to the Youth of our Age, to excite them to Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a circumſpect Converſation.</head>
            <p>THE worthy Author of theſe Writings, was one whoſe near Relation to me began our Acquaintance almoſt with our Lives; ſhe was the only Child of her Mother, as I of my Father, and they one Brother and Siſter. This gave us Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of frequent Converſe with each other; and having no Siſters of our own, and our natural Inclinations and Tempers being ſuitable, cauſed us more to reſpect each other: Tho' ſhe was of more Years, and different Principles, in Matters of Religion<note n="*" place="margin">Being one called Quaker.</note>, at that Time, yet the Sympathy and Kindneſs that was betwixt us, out-balanced the ſeeming Diſparity; and we could argue without Wrangling, and diſſent without Diſcord; and ſuch
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0003_101CC8DCC80884C0"/>
was her prudent winning Carriage towards me, that even in my green and childiſh Years, ſhe often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with me to quit many trifling Things, in which I then delighted, for more profitable Employments; which ſhe was not wanting to recommend to me, nor to tell me of my Faults; but with ſo much Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and good Counſel, that like a mollifying, healing Balſam, it cured almoſt inſenſibly. And ſo far was I from accounting her my Enemy, for telling me the Truth, that conſidering her Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Virtue, together with her plain Dealing, which I took as no ſmall Argument of her Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; knowing, Reproof and good Advice to be ſo thankleſs an Office, that nothing but Love and Duty can prevail with a diſcreet Perſon to act that Part: I ſay, upon theſe Inducements I made Choice of her as my particular Boſom Friend. Nor was I miſtaken or diſappointed, for ſuch ſhe approved herſelf; making Choice of me alſo as hers, ſoon after my Convincement. Thus was our Love reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal: And this was the Beginning of our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo often mentioned in her Verſes; which the rather induceth me to hint it here, as an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all who profeſs the pure unerring Truth, to keep faithful in their Place and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that ſo the Lord may make Uſe of them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and win their Familiars and Relations to love and embrace the precious Truth, as ſhe was made an happy Inſtrument of Good to me, by her many kind Admonitions, and ſeaſonable Cautions, verbal and literal, both in Verſe and Proſe: But chiefly, that prevailing Argument of good Example, and circumſpect Converſation, which the Lord, in his infinite Mercy, was pleaſed ſo to bleſs, that they became Motives to me, to conſider how much I was ſhort of her; and to examine her Principles, as well as my own: Then did the Lord open my Eyes, and by his Light and Spirit in my Heart, gave me
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0004_101CC8DE66505598"/>
a Sight of my inward State and Condition; which I found to be unſafe, notwithſtanding the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of a ſober Education; and that, if my Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs exceeded not that of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, in vain was it to expect an Admittance into the heavenly Kingdom. So that after much Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and many Conflicts, the Lord brought me to this Reſolution in my own Mind, That if he would be pleaſed to diſcover his Way, which leads to Life and Salvation, and how I ſhould attain Power to walk in it, ſo that I might enjoy his Peace, which I ſo much wanted, with his Aſſiſtance I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Diſciple, and follow him whitherſoever he ſhould lead: Then did the Lord, in his great Love, and never to be forgotten Condeſcenſion, ſhew me, that it was a ſtraight Way, deſpiſed by many wiſe and prudent of the World; and walked in by a poor, ſelf-denying, under-valued People, which it would be hard for me to be numbered with: And ſo I found it, being almoſt ready to deſpair, until the Lord inclined my Heart to take her Counſel, and go to ſome Meetings of the People called <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> where I heard the Way of God ſo plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and his bleſſed Truth ſo livingly preached, that I was convinced thereof, and well ſatisfied that the glorious Preſence of the Lord, and his Heart-mollifying Power, was with this People; which unuſually tender'd my Spirit, and diſtinguiſhed their Meetings from thoſe I had formerly frequented. This made me delight to meet with them, though much wonder'd at, ſcoff'd and reproach'd for it; yet by her encouraged: But, praiſed be the great Almighty God, he brought me in his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Time, to witneſs the Fulfilling of his ancient Prophecy,<note place="margin">Pſalm cx. 3.</note> making me <hi>willing in the Day of his Power;</hi> willing to become a Fool and Gazing-ſtock to my former Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; willing to be rid of the Load of Sin I had
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0005_101CC8E1226EC220"/>
laboured under: And conſidering that no Burden could be heavier, was alſo made to accept the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Invitation of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, who ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat xi. 8. 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>Come unto me, all you who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt; take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye ſhall find Reſt to your Souls; for my Yoke is eaſy, and my Burden is light:</hi> And bleſſed be the eternal Goodneſs, I have witneſſed it to be ſo, in compariſon of the Bondage of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I here inſert my Exerciſe, for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Sincere-hearted, that all may depend upon the Lord,<note place="margin">Heb. xi 6.</note> who is a good <hi>Rewarder of them who diligently ſeek him;</hi> and can give Teſtimony, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Meaſure, that his <hi>Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. iii. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and all his Paths are Peace:</hi> Therefore let thoſe, whoſe Feet are thither turned, hold on their Way, and perſevere in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Purity; that ſo they may grow ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſtronger, and be able to lend a helping-hand to them who are weak; as this my dear Friend hath often done, both to me and others. And let all, who are yet ſeeking the Lord and his Truth, be encouraged in his Faithfulneſs and Obedience to follow God's Requirings in their own Hearts;<note place="margin">Rom. i. 19.</note> 
               <hi>for that which may be known of God,</hi>

they faint not, but hold out to the End;</hi> as did the Author of the enſuing Verſes; of whom I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give the Reader ſome Account.</p>
            <p>She was one who, in her Childhood, was much afflicted with weak Eyes, which made her unfit for the uſual Employment of Girls; and being of a large natural Capacity, quick, witty, and ſtudiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined, her Father brought her up to more Learning, than is commonly beſtowed on our Sex; in which ſhe became ſo good a Proficient, that ſhe well underſtood the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, fluently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in it; and made a conſiderable Progreſs in <hi>Greek</hi> alſo; wrote ſeveral Hands well; was a good Arithmetician, yea, in the beſt Arithmetick; <hi>for ſhe ſo numbered her Days, as to apply her Heart unto Wiſdom;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm xc. 12.</note> as alſo to the Study of ſeveral uſeful Arts; had a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Phyſick and Surgery, the nature of Plants, Herbs, and Minerals; and made ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into divers profitable Sciences; delighting in the Study of Nature, and to admire the great God of Nature, in the various Operations of his Power and Goodneſs; the wonderful Harmony and Order of the Creation, and the infinite Wiſdom by which it is govern'd; of which ſhe would often ſpeak: Admiring how there could be an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in the World, ſince the Creation doth ſo plainly aſſert the Being of a Deity. And as we have been walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or riding together, would often diſcourſe of the preſent Objects, much tending to Edification; making many pretty Remarks, and comparing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Things with inward: As alſo, upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, would draw ſuch uſeful Obſervations, as made her Company profitable and delighting: For ſhe was of a thoughtful, compoſed Temper; yet of a quick Apprehenſion, and ingenious; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſon'd with Truth, in which ſhe had many ſweet Openings, theſe meeting in a Temper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable,
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0007_101CC8E55C282140"/>
and concerned for the Good of others, made her Converſation improving and deſirable. She was one who loved the bleſſed Truth, and they who walked according to it, from a Child, being early convinced thereof; tho' ſhe was not ſatisfied with a bare Profeſſion of Religion, but zealous for the Life of it, both in herſelf and others; alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with good Arguments to defend it, being ready to give an Anſwer to every one that aſked a <hi>Reaſon of the Hope which was in her,</hi> with Meekneſs and Fear: Nor forward to begin a Diſpute, yet ſound in what ſhe undertook, and never, that I know of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oil'd in an Argument; for ſhe had an Eye to the Lord, and liked to be ſatisfied that ſhe was in her Place, and called by him to what ſhe did for him: Would often mention the Paſſage of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vi. 6, 7. how Death was his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for putting forth his Hand to take hold of the Ark of God, when the Oxen ſhook it; it being a Service not required of him.</p>
            <p>Nor was ſhe proud, or conceited of her Parts and Learning, but adorned with an humble Modeſty; having, I believe, meaner Thoughts of herſelf, than any one elſe had of her, who knew her Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
            <p>Plain and decent in her Cloaths, which ſhe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued for Service more than Sight; and ſlighted, in compariſon of thoſe better Ornaments of the Mind, which ſhe prefer'd above ſplendid or coſtly Apparel.</p>
            <p>She was one that loved to read the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſuch uſeful Authors as had a Tendency to Improvement; in which ſhe ſpent much Time: God having furniſhed her with an extraordinary Memory to retain the ſame.</p>
            <p>She delighted much in Solitude, and was often alone; ſetting apart ſome Time of the Day for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement; and would frequently ſay to me, in the Evenings, Let us go aſide, and wait upon the
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0008_101CC8E724C24740"/>
Lord; we have daily Need of daily Bread, and to renew our Strength; and how can we expect it, if we do not wait for it? And would recite the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Elijah, 1 Kings</hi> xviii. 36. that at the Time of the Evening Sacrifice, the Lord anſwered by Fire; with other pretty Remarks, too tedious to inſert, which ſhe abounded in, upon all Occaſions, to promote that which was good: In theſe Times of Retirement, Verſes would often come up in her Mind, which ſhe afterwards wrote: Many of theſe, herewith printed, being Meditations according to the Frame and Exerciſe of her Spirit, when thus compoſed.</p>
            <p>Neither did ſhe neglect publick Opportunities to worſhip God; for ſhe was diligent in frequenting religious Meetings, not being apt to omit any, unleſs upon an extraordinary Occaſion. Nor did ſhe ſuffer her Eyes to wander, which the Mind too often accompanies; but the Compoſedneſs of her Countenance, ſhewed the Sedateneſs of her well exerciſed Mind: And the good Improvement ſhe made of publick and private Devotion, her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Life did clearly diſcover; which ſhe well began in her early Years, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted her Progreſs therein, by her Conſtancy and Perſeverance to the End, which crowns all; <hi>for 'tis he that endures to the End, that ſhall be ſaved:</hi> This ſhe had a Regard to, more than the fading Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this uncertain World; and, I believe, ſhe was in a good Condition when ſhe left it, and laid down her Head in Peace with the Lord, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Savour behind her.</p>
            <p>She was one who willingly and chearfully ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Truth, encouraging others to do the like, both by Precept and Example: One juſt, honeſt, and true to her Word, temperate and ſelf-denying; keeping within the Limits preſcribed for Health, which ſhe regarded, more than to gratify a
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0009_101CC8EC91047DB8"/>
luxurious Appetite: Solid and grave in her Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, mixt with an innocent Chearfulneſs; not formally auſtere; yet rather reſerv'd, than over-free; baſhful, than bold.</p>
            <p>To conclude, ſhe was one whoſe Modeſty, Charity, Friendſhip, and religious Converſation, came not ſhort of her excellent Writings; to which I refer the Reader, for a fuller Character of their Author than I am capable of giving: Her own Pen having diſcovered the rich Treaſure of her pious Mind. But what I have written, is from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Knowledge of her; and no one, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, knew her better than myſelf: For ſhe was as much without Reſerve to me, I think, as one Friend could be to another; for we loved entirely, communicated our Minds and Exerciſes to each other freely, adviſing with one another on moſt Occaſions: And great was our Nearneſs and Unity of Spirit, in the Truth; yea, great was her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of my Welfare, which ſhe zealouſly laboured for; as the many Letters, both in Verſe and Proſe, to me writ, and herewith printed, largely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>And tho' Verſe is not ſo commonly uſed in divine Subjects as Proſe, and but too much abuſed by the extravagant Wits of the Age; yet ſhe, like a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chymiſt, had learned to ſeparate the purer Spirits, and more refined Parts of Poetry, from the earthly, worthleſs Droſs; and made Uſe of her Gift, rather to convince and prevail upon the Mind, to affect and raiſe the Soul upon the Wings of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Contemplation, than to pleaſe the airy Fancy with Strains of Wit, and unprofitable Invention; which ſhe was ever careful to avoid.</p>
            <p>And tho' living Teſtimonies to the Truth are numerous, yet few extant in Verſe, which hath an harmonious delightful Faculty in it, that influences the Minds of ſome more than Proſe, eſpecially
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0010_101CC8EF34A416E8"/>
young People, and is more apt to imprint itſelf in the Memory: Therefore her Subject being divine, and ſo ſenſibly and ſolidly managed; as it hath been of Service to thoſe few who have had the Peruſal of it, ſo, I hope, will be attended with a general Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
            <p>And having reaped no ſmall Advantage thereby myſelf, could do no leſs, than recommend her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Labours, and exemplary Life, to others, as a Pattern well worth following. For her Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may ſay of her, as was ſaid of <hi>Ruth, The City of my People doth know that ſhe was a virtuous Woman.</hi> And being a good Inſtrument in the Hand of the Lord to me, having alſo been much comforted, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and refreſhed by her Verſes, my Deſire is, that the Lord may ſo bleſs them to Poſterity, that they may reap ſuch an Advantage by them, as may tend to the Promotion of Truth, and the Good of Souls in general.</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING MY DEAR FRIEND MARY MOLLINEUX.</head>
            <p>AS concerning my dearly beloved Friend, <hi>Many Mollineux,</hi> I have more to teſtify than I ſhall commit to Writing, having had intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Fellowſhip with her above ſixteen Years; in all which Time, her grave, virtuous, modeſt Life and Converſation, deſerveth ſingular Remembrance; becauſe her friendly Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Conference, and Deportment, was always ſolid, ſenſible, and tender, mixt with a feeling and ſympathizing Love to her Friends, in all Exerciſes and Afflictions: She was one, to whom I could freely impart my Mind and Concerns, in any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; as I have often done, to my Comfort and Refreſhment. My Heart is moved, in the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her Faithfulneſs and Integrity, from the Day that I was firſt acquainted with her, with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the Loſs of ſo near a Friend; who, although ſhe was plentifully endued with many worthy Gifts and Parts, both natural and ſpiritual, yet I never knew her lifted up in any of them, nor exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her Meaſure; but rather reſerved, than in any wiſe forwardly divulging her Gifts to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cenſure, without weighty Conſideration; ſo that ſhe would not caſt her Pearls before Swine: Yet not ſo much reſerved, but that to her near in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0012_101CC8F4C6457418"/>
Friends, whom ſhe knew in the Fellowſhip and Bond of Truth, ſhe was very free and tender. I remember, that ſeveral Years ago, when ſhe was a ſingle Woman, upon the Peruſal of ſome Copies of her Verſes which ſhe gave me, I felt ſuch Unity of Spirit with them, that I ſaid, I thought they might be of Service, if made publick in print; but ſhe was not then free that her Name ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; ſhe not ſeeking Praiſe amongſt Men, but to communicate the Exerciſe of peculiar Gifts amongſt her near Friends and Acquaintance; but now, ſince it hath pleaſed the Lord to remove her out of the earthly Tabernacle, into everlaſting Reſt, in which I am well ſatisfied ſhe is forever bleſſed, I think it would be very ungrateful to her Memory, and alſo a wronging of others, to keep ſuch worthy Things unpubliſhed; with which, I believe, the moſt that are of open Underſtandings, and unprejudiced Hearts, will have, in ſome meaſure, Unity. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and hope, they may truly tend to the Benefit of all moderate Readers, and to the Praiſe of Him, who is the only Author of every good and perfect Gift.</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING MY LATE WIFE MARY MOLLINEUX, DECEASED.</head>
            <p>CONCERNING my dear, loving, and late deceaſed Wife, <hi>Mary Mollineux,</hi> formerly <hi>Mary Southworth,</hi> whom I took in Marriage on the 10th Day of the Second Month, 1685. I was firſt acquainted with her at <hi>Lancaſter-Caſtle,</hi> where we both at one Time were Priſoners, for being at a peaceable religious Meeting of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in the Year 1684, tho' we had ſeen each other before. In which Impriſonment, I believed that ſhe ſhould be my Wife; but never intended to expreſs any Thing thereof, whilſt we were both Priſoners there; and after ſhe was releaſed, I ſaw her, and was in Company with her ſeveral Times, before I expreſſed any Thing of my Concern to take her to be my Wife; ſeveral conſiderable Men having before attempted to prevail with her on that Account: And during the whole Time of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with her, which was above eleven Years, her Life and Converſation was ſerious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, ſweet and ſavoury; and ſhe was very lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diligent, tender-hearted, and kindly affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate towards me, and our Children; and generally
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0014_101CC8FA44C340E8"/>
loving and tender towards all People, eſpecially ſuch as were in any Diſtreſs, Sickneſs, or Affliction, tho' never ſo poor; and the Lord bleſſed her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, as well in Advice, as Adminiſtration of Remedies, to ſeveral; ſo that they have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their Recoveries to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thereby, thro' his Bleſſing: And what ſhe did therein, was free. She was very careful, that nothing of Evil might get a Place in her Children, or in any with whom ſhe was concerned: And therefore good Advice and Admonition ſhe frequently gave, which many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Love and good Eſteem of her. The Lord opened her Underſtanding, and enlarged her Capacity, in a great Degree, upon ſeveral Accounts; yet her Mind was not lifted up thereby, ſo as to glory in her Gifts or Parts; but learning of Chriſt, the Truth, to be <hi>lowly in Heart,</hi> ſhe choſe rather to appear little to Men. She was very conſtant and cordial to her Friends, and true in concealing of Secrets. She was often concerned to make Peace amongſt them that were at Difference, and often prevailed therein. She was plain and free in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Faces of any, but abhorred to reproach any in ſecret. Her Heart was inclined towards God, therefore ſhe was juſt in her Dealing, with all people with whom ſhe had to do. She was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Way of Truth in her Youth, by the Light or inward Appearance of Chriſt in her Heart, which ſhe loved; and therefore, ſhe retaining her Integrity to the End of her Time, a Crown of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Life and Glory, I believe, the Lord hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon her. She was very noble in ſuffering Perſecution for the Teſtimony of Truth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during hard Exerciſes, occaſioned by my ſeveral Impriſonments for the ſame Cauſe, whilſt ſhe was my Wife. And through ſeveral Sickneſſes and Afflictions the Lord ſupported her, to perſevere in Patience, Faithfulneſs and Conſtancy to him. She
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0015_101CC8FBE0A909C8"/>
was very punctual in Performance of her Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and quick, diſcreet, and diligent in her Buſineſs; yet ſtill ſhe uſed to take a Time for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Retirement in Evenings alone, except I was with her, to wait upon, and feel after the Lord, in the Gift of his Light; Love and Grace in her Heart; and to ſee that, with the wiſe Virgins, ſhe had Oil in her burning Lamp, that it might not go out; but that ſhe might be ready to enter into the Marriage Chamber, whenſoever the Lord, the Bridegroom of her Soul, came. She was alſo very diligent, in attending the Aſſemblies of the People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> with them to meet in the Name, Power, Light and Spirit of the Lord, to wait upon him, to be opened by him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Refreſhment, Strength and Comfort from him, and to feel the Renewings of his Love and Goodneſs in her Soul. And that Day Week next before her laſt Illneſs ſeized her, after a more than uſual manner, ſhe ſaid to me, <hi>That the feeling and enjoying of the ſweet eternal Love of God in her Heart, was more precious to her, than all other Things that could be enjoyed, &amp;c.</hi> She was concerned in her Spirit, that many, with her, and all that are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, might come to <hi>taſte and ſee how good the Lord is;</hi> and upon that Account, her Words, Writings and Converſation, were acceptable, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, and ſerviceable to the Invitation, Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Strengthning and Encouragement of ſome to ſeek after the Lord, and his bleſſed Way and Truth, inwardly revealed, and to be revealed; wherein many have found great Satisfaction and Cauſe of Rejoicing. And that many more may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Benefit by her Writings, I am deſirous and concerned to publiſh them, and refer all ſober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in the Fear of God, to peruſe them; not doubting but ſuch may receive Advantage thereby; tho' ſhe was not free to commit them to publick
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0016_101CC8FFE33C9D58"/>
View in her Life-time, yet ſhe had nothing againſt the publiſhing thereof afterwards.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall give a brief Account of what I was and am a Witneſs of, concerning her laſt Illneſs; and ſome of the ſweet, ſenſible and precious Words which ſhe ſpake in the Time thereof, being very ſenſible to the End; ſo that ſhe ſpake no imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or unſenſible Word therein, that I know of, who conſtantly attended her.</p>
            <p>Upon the 8th Day of the Tenth Month, 1695, ſhe was ſeized with violent Pain and Sickneſs, which continued, ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs: And one Morning, ſoon after, ſhe ſaid to me thus; <hi>I have had ſuch a Dream, as I have ſeldom had; it is an Emblem of my Life.</hi> And then ſhe told it me thus; <hi>viz. She dreamed, that ſhe was going at the Side of a pleaſant broad River, and ſometimes ſhe came to Breaches; which Brooks, running into the River, or the like, had made upon the Shore of it; which Breaches ſhe paſſed over, but ſometimes with Difficulty, and then ran faſt on ſtill, till ſhe came to another Breach, and having paſſed ſeveral Breaches, ſome greater, and ſome leſſer, at laſt, ſhe came to a Breach which was greater than any of the reſt, and ſhe ſaid within herſelf, how ſhall I get over this Breach? But yet ſhe went on, and paſſed through it, and it was fair on the other Side; and ſhe awaked.</hi> Now, as ſhe looked upon this Dream to be an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of her Life, ſo I cannot, nor could not, ſince ſhe told it me, expound it otherwiſe than thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That the pleaſant broad River, ſignified the Lord her Creator, who is to his People <hi>a Place of broad Rivers,</hi> Iſa. xxxiii. 21. and the Shore thereof, upon which ſhe walked, ſignified Time; and the Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which ſhe paſſed over, were the Difficulties and Afflictions which ſhe paſſed through in her Time, and the laſt and greateſt Breach which ſhe came to, and paſſed over, ſignified her laſt Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0017_101CC90289A39338"/>
and Death. From which Dream, as a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Parable, all may learn and conſider, how faſt they are haſtning, or running, towards their laſt and greateſt Breach; even the Death, or Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their earthly Tabernacles; and none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how near they are to it. About nine Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her ſaid Illneſs began, ſhe ſaid to me thus, <hi>viz. I am well content, if the Lord ſee meet, that he take me away by this Diſtemper, rather than to be in this Pain; for my Pain is great, and I know not what in this World I can deſire to ſtay to enjoy, except it be my Love, and my little Lads;</hi> meaning me, and our two Children: Of whom ſhe then ſaid thus: <hi>I would rather have my Children enriched with the Fear of the Lord, than with all manner of worldly Riches.</hi> About the ſame Time ſhe ſaid, <hi>I am thinking of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt</hi> Richard Johnſon, who was a near Friend to us, <hi>that ſlept much of the Time of his Illneſs before his Departure; methinks it ſeemeth like an eaſy Paſſage.</hi> And ſoon after that, ſhe began to be inclin'd to Sleepineſs, and ſlept more and more till the End; yet, at her awaking, was ſtill ſensible and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: And tho' ſhe was daily weaker and weaker, yet ſhe would ſtill ſit up five or ſix, or more, Hours in the Evenings, and diſcourſe freely and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till within five Days of her Departure. I often deſired her to accept of the Advice of ſome Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, but ſhe was ſtill averſe thereto in this Illneſs, tho' in other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhe had complied. On the 20th Day of her Illneſs; in the Evening, diſcourſing very freely, as formerly, ſhe told me, <hi>She was well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that if the Lord took her away by that Diſtemper, ſhe ſhould be eternally happy;</hi> with many other ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and comfortable Expreſſions: Tho' ſhe was ſo weak, that the ſame Evening, about the eleventh Hour, I thought ſhe had been departing; but in a little Time, recovering her Breath, ſhe ſpoke chearfully, and ſlept, At her awaking, that Night,
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0018_101CC9052C438B00"/>
I aſked her, How ſhe was? She anſwered, <hi>Through Mercy, indifferent.</hi> And after a little Pauſe, ſhe very ſenſibly ſaid, <hi>Amictum iri, vel Ami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iendum eſſe;</hi> which is in <hi>Engliſh, To be cloathed hereafter,</hi> in two Expreſſions of it: Whereby I underſtood, that ſhe was minding how the Lord would cloath her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when her mortal Cloathing was put off. Then I deſired her, in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Words, for they that were preſent, underſtood not <hi>Latin,</hi> that if ſhe had any Thing in her Mind, either concerning her Children, or any other Thing, farther to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to me, that ſhe would do it; but ſhe, as if all outward Things were then out of her Thoughts, quickly replied in <hi>Latin,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Why ſpeakeſt thou ſuch Things? Doſt not thou underſtand me?</hi> I anſwered in <hi>Latin,</hi> Yes, I very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thee, and that thou ſpeakeſt of ſpiritual Things: She anſwered, <hi>Yes, but ſhe had nothing, concerning outward Things, farther to communicate to me.</hi> The next Morning, about the ninth Hour, I again thought ſhe had been departing; but after a little Time, ſomewhat recovering her Breath, and ſeeing me expreſs, to Friends that were preſent, ſomething of my Concern for her, ſhe ſaid to me, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She anſwered, <hi>Drawing nearer and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> And many ſweet and loving Sentences ſhe ſpake to me that Day, and the Day next after; but afterwards was ſcarcely able to anſwer to any Queſtion, but continued moſtly ſleeping as it were, ſweetly and quietly: And on the 3d Day of the
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0019_101CC906B5774568"/>
eleventh Month 1695, in the Evening, ſhe depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the leaſt Sigh or Groan.</p>
            <p>And ſo, though the Lord, who, in his Love, joined us together, and gave us for Bleſſings to each other, and bleſſed us with the abundant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his Love in our Hearts, even to the End of her Time, hath ſeen meet to take from me her Company, which I valued above all other temporal Enjoyments; the Loſs whereof is great to me: Yet being ſatisfied that ſhe is entered into Reſt, in the Boſom of God's Love, with him to live in Peace and Happineſs for ever; and alſo, being clear, in that, through his Aſſiſtance, according to the Underſtanding given me, I have endeavoured fully to diſcharge my Duty of endeared Love to her, in every Reſpect, in her laſt, as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Exerciſes; therefore I am, in the Love of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comforted, and can chearfully and freely ſay, The Lord's Will is worthy to be done in all Things, and his Name to be bleſſed, praiſed and magnified, over all, for ever,</p>

            <head>The following Relation, touching ſome Diſcourſe that, upon Occaſion, ſhe had with Doctor Stratford, ſo called, Biſhop of the Dioceſs of Cheſhire and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire, &amp;c.</head>

                        <head type="sub">Given forth and atteſted by my Kinſman Henry Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineux, who was there preſent, viz.</head>
                        <p>UPON the 18th Day of the twelfth Month, 1690, I and another Neighbour were taken Priſoners, and brought to <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Jail, upon a Writ <hi>De Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> for not appearing at the Biſhop's Court in <hi>Cheſter;</hi> though willing to appear, but had no Citation ſhewed us, nor lawful Notice given: Of which Proceedings, it being witneſſed under the Hands of ſeveral who were preſent when ſuch Notice was pretended to be given, ſhe acquainted the ſaid Biſhop, he being at <hi>Ormſkirk,</hi> near our Dwelling, in the ſixth Month, 1691, and it was ſo evidently manifeſted to him, that he ſeemed ſatisfied of the Truth thereof, and ſaid, <hi>They who ſhould have given the Notice, were to be blamed, &amp;c.</hi> And moderately diſcourſing with her, he ſaid, <hi>If ſhe would come to his Dwelling-houſe in</hi> Wigan, <hi>within two or three Weeks, when he had conferred with his Chancellor, if he could find out any Way to do it, he would do any Kindneſs therein that lay in his Power for her.</hi> Now that which ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, was that the Priſoners might be admitted in his Court to put in their Appearance; for want of which they were impriſoned. So, upon his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, on the 24th Day of the ſixth Month 1691, ſhe went to the Bishop's Houſe in <hi>Wigan,</hi> to receive
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0025_101CC918500618B8"/>
his Anſwer; where he again diſcourſed with her, and ſeemed willing that the Priſoners might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to put in their Appearance; but his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's Deputy there concluded, that they could not be ſo admitted. Then the Biſhop aſked her, <hi>Why they could not pay the Church-leys,</hi> for that was the Cauſe for which we were proſecuted; ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>They could not pay them for Conſcience-ſake:</hi> He required her to ſhew him ſome Scripture for it; then ſhe aſked him to ſhew her any Precept or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Scriptures, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> or any of the People of God, ever offered to compel any other People to pay towards the upholding of their Worſhip, or Worſhip-houſes, or Temples? The Biſhop replied, <hi>Tho' he could not do that, yet what Scripture have you for it,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that you cannot pay to ours for Conſcience-ſake?</hi> She anſwering, ſaid, I will offer thee Scripture for it, and it is this: It is ſaid in the Scriptures, <hi>Come out from among them, (my People) and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, touch not the unclean Thing, and I will receive you,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 17, 18. Rev. xviii. 4. Now, ſaid ſhe, if we had believed that you, in your Worſhip, had been right, we had not come out from amongſt you; but becauſe we believed, and were convinced, that it was not right, and therefore are come out from amongſt you, we dare not for Conſcience-ſake touch with you; but if we ſhould pay towards your Worſhip, or Worſhip-houſes, we ſhould both touch and uphold. To which Anſwer, the Biſhop made no Reply; but he ſaid to his Chancellor's Deputy, <hi>I pray you, Mr.</hi> Preſcot, <hi>if you can find out any way, that they may put in their Appearance, that they may have their Liberty, let it be done; and do what Kindneſs you can for them:</hi> And ſo he went his way. The Biſhop could give no Scripture, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to her Queſtion; but ſhe anſwered his Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Scripture, ſo that he made no Reply:
<pb facs="unknown:043092_0026_101CC91D6FC0EA20"/>
And ſhe, to his Face, bore a faithful Teſtimony againſt their Worſhip, which is preſcribed by Men; which Teſtimony the Biſhop did not contradict. And there being then preſent, one <hi>Entwiſtle,</hi> the Biſhop's Chaplain, ſo called, and his Brother <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſtle,</hi> a Lawyer, and another Prieſt, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Daughter; when the Biſhop was gone, and ſhe and her Kinſman were come out of the Houſe, and were going away, they all four followed; and the ſaid Chaplain, or Prieſt <hi>Entwiſtle,</hi> began, and engaged with her in a Diſpute concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in about half an Hour, or leſs, he was ſo taken and confounded in his own Arguments, that his Mouth was ſtopped; which his Brother, the Lawyer ſeeing, as it were to excuſe him, ſaid to him, <hi>I wonder you ſhould trouble yourſelf to diſcourſe with that Woman, ſhe hath ſo much Learning, it makes her mad.</hi> To which ſhe ſaid, What! do you (Letter-learned) now begin to vilify Learning, by which you have your Honours and Preferments? Then the Lawyer, not ſpeaking any other Word, went away, and ſhe left them.</p>

            <p>After this, we being out of Priſon, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Pariſh-Prieſt was endeavouring to get us into it again, (and ſo we were again impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned) ſhe ſpoke theſe Words, which I then wrote, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>THE Author of this miſcellaneous Grove,</l>
               <l>Was fruitful both in Virtue and in Love:</l>
               <l>Read but the following Lines, and thou may'st find,</l>
               <l>She was the Miſtreſs of a noble Mind;</l>
               <l>A Soul, of more than common ſize, poſſeſs'd</l>
               <l>Her almoſt, I had ſaid, too narrow Breaſt.</l>
               <l>True to her Friend, as plainly doth appear,</l>
               <l>In dealing plainly with her Friend ſo dear:</l>
               <l>She us'd no gilded Baits, no Flattery,</l>
               <l>No feigned Words, but plain Sincerity;</l>
               <l>Which doth beſpeak her Love, and Virtue too,</l>
               <l>Contended one the other to out-do.</l>
               <l>In Numbers ſweet, her warbling Pen hath try'd</l>
               <l>Unerring Truth from Error to divide:</l>
               <l>Her Lines, thus meaſur'd, have ſucceſsful been</l>
               <l>To turn the wand'ring Mind to ſearch within;</l>
               <l>Where that invaluable Treaſure lies,</l>
               <l>Unſought by moſt, diſcover'd to the Wiſe;</l>
               <l>But yet conceal'd and hid from vult'rous Eyes.</l>
               <l>'Tis not the common Way, I muſt confeſs,</l>
               <l>To write in Verſe; although 'tis ne'ertheleſs</l>
               <l>To be eſteem'd; becauſe ſome do diſdain,</l>
               <l>And undervalue what they can't attain:</l>
               <l>I'd have ſuch unadviſed ones to know,</l>
               <l>Their Genius perches on a lower Bough,</l>

For want of Wings their untun'd Souls to raiſe</l>
               <l>Unto a Pitch of Harmony and Praiſe.</l>
               <l>Oft have I ſeen the Lark upon the Wing,</l>
               <l>Toward the Sun aſcend, and ſweetly ſing,</l>
               <l>As if ſhe had a Tribute due to pay</l>
               <l>Unto the mighty Ruler of the Day,</l>
               <l>In well compoſed Songs of tuneful Breath,</l>
               <l>Such as the Swan repeats before her Death.</l>
               <l>Thus was our Author's noble Faculty</l>
               <l>Employ'd to render Thanks, in Melody,</l>
               <l>To Him, from whom ſhe did her Life receive;</l>
               <l>To Him, who never ſparingly doth give</l>
               <l>To them that, to His Praiſe, His Gifts do uſe,</l>
               <l>And with His Bleſſings don't the World abuſe.</l>
               <l>'Tis ſuch as theſe unto the Well can ſing,</l>

               <l>Which, tho' by ſome abus'd, its Value don't allay.</l>

               <l>Which may ſuffice to let the Reader know,</l>
               <l>He was a Poet, and a Prophet too.</l>
               <l>The wiſeſt Prince that ever fill'd a Throne,</l>
               <l>Or ſway'd a Scepter in the World, was one,</l>

               <p>IN the unfeigned Love, my Heart is concerned for thee, really deſiring thy temporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Welfare: I ſhould be glad indeed to be made inſtrumental for thy Satisfaction, in Doubts or Scruples; but, alas! Words or Arguments cannot, without the powerful Influence of the living Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word in thy own Heart, reſolve or diſannul the Conſultations and Reaſonings of this kind, that may inwardly ariſe, or be by others ſuggeſted unto thee: Yet this is in my Mind to ſignify, touching the Word <hi>[Thou]</hi> that beſides the Properneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is the Phraſe and Language uſed in Scripture, by ſome owned for a Rule; and 'tis moſtly a ſlaviſh Fear of Men, that in the Hearts of thoſe that would ſhun the Croſs, deters from the Uſe of it. Yet I deſire not to invite thee to a bare Formality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for until thou art convinced in thy own Mind, that
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:043092_0036_101CC9391410FE50"/>
the Day of ſmall Things is not to be deſpiſed, and knoweſt that Power and Love which capacitates and enables to undergo Trials; which are indeed but momentary, in compariſon of the exceeding Weight of Glory, that unto the Faithful is and ſhall be revealed, it ſignifies little; but it is written, <hi>He that will be my Diſciple, muſt take up the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the Names of Days or Months, as now uſed, they are contrary to Scripture, where it is written, the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond,</hi> &amp;c. as in <hi>John</hi> xx. 1, 19. and in <hi>Zephaniah</hi> iii. 9. there is a Promiſe, <hi>I will turn the People to a pure Language,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will take away the Names of Baalim out of her Mouth,</hi> Hoſ. ii. 17.</p>
               <p>Now concerning outward Sacraments, as thou termeſt them; they indeed are outward only, and Shadows; but the Subſtance being come, they flee away. Neither can outward Water purify the Conſcience, nor outward Bread nouriſh the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul. And tho' in the Infancy of ſome, ſuch Things were in Condescension permitted, as alſo Circumciſion; yet the Baptiſm of Chriſt, which was then ſaid to exceed <hi>John's,</hi> was with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire, which quickens and purifies the Heart, Soul, and Body; which <hi>Paul</hi> preferred before <hi>Touching,</hi>

                  <l>Thus Man's redeem'd unto a bleſſed State,</l>
                  <l>That was become loſt and degenerate,</l>

                  <l>THAT Love, <hi>dear Friend,</hi> which brings thee to my Mind,</l>
                  <l>Thus frequently, hath now again inclin'd</l>
                  <l>To viſit thee, with theſe Conſiderations</l>
                  <l>Concerning thee: O let thy Meditations</l>
                  <l>Hereof be ſerious! Let all Vanity</l>
                  <l>Be far exil'd, and love Simplicity.</l>
                  <l>Shall I object to thee the pompous State</l>
                  <l>Of purple <hi>Dives,</hi> or his dreadful Fate?</l>
                  <l>Nay ſurely! Thou the Hiſtory canſt read;</l>
                  <l>Read thou within, and let not Self-hood plead.</l>
                  <l>His unrelenting Heart deſpis'd the Poor,</l>
                  <l>Ev'n <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that languiſh'd at his Door,</l>
                  <l>Without Relief: Whereas in ſuch a State,</l>
                  <l>I ſhould (think'ſt thou) be more compaſſionate,</l>
                  <l>And not ſo diſregard him. Ah, my Friend!</l>
                  <l>Though ſome a Hand of Charity extend,</l>
                  <l>As outwardly, which in its Place is good,</l>
                  <l>Imparting ſometimes Raiment, ſometimes Food,</l>
                  <l>To fellow Creatures: Yet there's one that's poor,</l>
                  <l>Humble and meek, contemned at thy Door;</l>
                  <l>That waits for Entrance, and that gently knocks,</l>
                  <l>Until the Dew have wet his comely Locks;</l>
                  <l>Open to entertain him now, for he</l>
                  <l>Is come in tender Love to viſit thee:</l>
                  <l>And tho' poor, meek, and lowly he appear</l>
                  <l>He's King of Kings; therefore incline thine Ear</l>
                  <l>To his Requeſt, that he may dwell with thee,</l>
                  <l>Whoſe Love's the Fountain of Felicity.</l>

For when he was, by a related Friend,</l>
                  <l>Solicited their Fancies t'entertain,</l>
                  <l>Who urging (when his Life ſeem'd near its End)</l>
                  <l>To die a <hi>Catholick,</hi> 'twas all in vain:</l>
                  <l>The ſacred Precepts of the bleſſed Truth</l>
                  <l>Began to ſpring up in his blooming Youth.</l>
                  <l>So that, for all the Favours he receiv'd</l>
                  <l>From that Relation, or great Hopes of more,</l>
                  <l>By Promiſe due, he would not be deceiv'd</l>
                  <l>To own thoſe Principles he knew before</l>
                  <l>Were Men's Inventions; thus Heav'n ſecretly.</l>
                  <l>Did ſhroud and keep him from ſuch Subtilty.</l>
                  <l>And in ſucceeding Days did plainly ſhew</l>
                  <l>A way more excellent, a bleſſed Way;</l>
                  <l>Whereby he, to his Satisfaction knew</l>
                  <l>That Path, wherein Fools walking cannot ſtray;</l>
                  <l>Now, let his Weakneſs be forgotten quite,</l>

                  <l>His ſecond Self, by him was well belov'd;</l>

                  <l>A ſecond Love ſhe never entertain'd,</l>

If any her Aſſiſtance did implore,</l>

                  <l>By her Example, to become more mild,</l>

                  <l>Although they run the Hazard to be hurl'd</l>
                  <l>On wrecking Rocks, or quick devouring Sands,</l>
                  <l>Or caſt as Captives on ſome foreign Lands,</l>
                  <l>To ſpend their wretched Days in Miſery,</l>

                  <l>Abounding Wealth, if to their wiſhed Shore</l>
                  <l>They ſafe arrive; venture again, yet more</l>
                  <l>Undaunted than at firſt, in hopes to be</l>
                  <l>With more Succeſs, kept from thoſe Dangers free.</l>
                  <l>Then why ſhould ſuch Faint-heartedneſs appear,</l>
                  <l>In <hi>Iſrael's</hi> Camp, that ought of right to fear</l>
                  <l>None but the Lord? Can any doubt, that have</l>
                  <l>The Word of an almighty King, to ſave</l>
                  <l>Them to the uttermoſt? What! though he ſeem</l>
                  <l>To tarry long, his own appointed Time</l>
                  <l>Is always beſt; in greateſt Streights, we do</l>

                  <l>Salvation only from above; for then</l>

                  <l>Ah, was not <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus beſet? Could they</l>

                  <l>Yet was Deliverance near; the Sea muſt be</l>

                  <l>

                  </l>

                  <l>To him that gave it, if he pleaſe to call</l>
                  <l>To ſuch a Trial? Can we baulk the Way</l>

                  <l>But there's rejoicing, when with equal Mind</l>
