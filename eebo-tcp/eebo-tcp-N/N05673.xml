            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALTHOUGH by Providence it be alotted to me, for the moſt Part, to preach the Word of God in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tongue, notwithſtanding it doth ſometimes happen, that it is required of me to do it in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>—As it is the Duty of every faithful Paſtor, to lay Hold on all Occaſions that appear in any wiſe conducive to promote <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> among Mankind, without any Diſtinction of what People, Language or Nation ſoever: I would not neglect, in the late War, when I had on Lord's Days preached twice in <hi>Dutch</hi> to my own Flock, to preach a third Sermon in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to the Companies of Soldiers intended to defend us againſt the Aſſaults of the Enemy, who at that Time were without <hi>Urim</hi> or <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> without Prieſt or Levite, to ſhew them the Way of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The <hi>New-England</hi> Gentlemen, as they have yet ſomething left of the Religion of their pious and venerable Anceſtors, were the Perſons who at that Time preſſed me to what is mentioned, by their Remonſtrances, that they, deſiring to hear God's Word, and not underſtanding the <hi>Dutch Tongue,</hi> appealed to my Conſcience, whether, as Providence had ſo ordered, that I had learnt ſomething of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I could ſuffer them to be deſtitute of the Means of Grace, as Sheep that have no Shepherd?</p>

But God, with whom is the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the Spirit, inſpires him with Life and Courage, and Magnanimity of Soul: And having in the preceding Chapter, commanded him to propheſy, concerning <hi>Judah'</hi>s Captivity, ſhews him in this, the abſolute Power with which God is inveſted in diſpoſing of Nations, under the Type of a Potter, from thence to exhort <hi>Iſrael</hi> to return unto the Lord, from whom they were apoſtatized moſt ungratefully.</p>
            <p>So that the Words of my Text contains this important Truth; That as ſincere Penitence is a Means of averting an imminent and denounced Evil, from a Nation or People; ſo Impiety and Irreligion is the Way to forego all the good Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which otherwiſe might have been expected: And that to declare this, is the Province of God's faithful Servants, in order to reclaim vicious Mortals from ſinning againſt God, to a Courſe of real Religion and Piety.</p>
            <p>The Fitneſs and Propriety of this Matter to be now treated upon, in our preſent Situation of Affairs, I hope you will obſerve, my ſenſible and intelligent Hearers; whereas the preſent Time is a critical Juncture, in which we are to withſtand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and oppoſe our ambitious rivalling Neighbours, in their Encroachments upon our Borders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Lord, do thou cleanſe us from our Droſs; do thou ſend a Spirit of genuine Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among us:—Shouldſt thou ſearch us as</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>with Candles, our Backſlidings would appear too glaringly.—Heal us, O Lord, and we ſhall be healed; ſave us, and we ſhall be ſaved.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to treat upon this Matter, I ſhall, as to the Explication, take Notice of theſe three Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That when God threatens a Nation by an imminent Evil to its Deſtruction, true Repentance is a Means to avert the Evil, and to eſcape and avoid the impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and denounced Ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That when God promiſes Bleſſings to a Nation; Irreligion, Impiety and Ungodlineſs is a Means to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r and forego all thoſe Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is the indiſpenſible Duty of God's faithful Servants, to declare this, in order to reclaim vicious Mortals from their wicked Way, unto the Fear and Service of the Lord.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt: <hi>At what Inſtant,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom; to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it:</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

            <p>And I take thee, O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be this Nation in particular: Thy God and thy Father's God led thee forth, by a mighty Hand and a ſtrong Arm, out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Place of thy Servitude, of thy ignominious Slavery; and placed thee in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> flowing with Milk and Honey.—Ye <hi>Canaanites,</hi> ye <hi>

            <p>By afflictive Diſpenſations of Providence doth the Lord ſpeak unto the Nations, threatning them Deſtruction, if they repent not.—What Famines, what Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, what Deluges and Inundations; what Peſtilences and malignant Diſeaſes hath not a ſinful World been chaſtiſed with?

King <hi>David,</hi> wiſely and piouſly, choſe to fall into the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand of God, rather than into thoſe of Men; and yet all theſe are God's Warning Voice to the Nations, that <hi>when his Judgments are upon the Earth, its Inhabitants may learn Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto you, O Nations, doth the Lord ſpeak by his Faithful Servants; his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, his Prieſts, his Evangeliſts; his Apoſtles, his Paſtors and Teachers. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Miracles have they done for your Converſion unto God: Heaven and Earth, God and all his Saints, have they called to Witneſs over you, that they warned you of your Danger.—Whether ye now hear, or whether ye forbear, you ſhall know there have been Prophets among you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If now this Nation turn from their Evil, ſaith the Lord, I will repent of the Evil I thought to do unto them.</hi> What is it then, O ſinful Nation, the Lord requireth of thee? Is it not Repentance? Is it not to turn from your Evil?</p>
            <p>Turning from Evil or Repentance, may be taken in Relation to a Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to an individual Perſon in particular. The Repentance of a Nation in general, is, when a Nation believing God's Threatnings, and humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before him by Confeſſion of Sin, by Faſting and Prayer, and by other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Humiliation, endeavour a Reformation from the Vices they were guilty of, and to live in a Courſe of oppoſite Virtues.—Which general Repentance, it is to be hoped, in ſome may be ſincere, and of a genuine Sort; but is to be ſeared, that in many, and the greateſt Part, it is only ſurperficial, and meerly external, not proceeding from a good internal Principle of Renovation and Regeneration:—Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is often ſo pleaſing in the Sight of God, that he thereon averts a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Evil, and for the preſent, ſpares a People he had threatned with Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—I doubt not, O <hi>Ninevites,</hi> but your Repentance was, by ſome of you, genuine, and of a ſalutary Nature; though at the ſame Time, I fear that, with the greateſt Part, it was but like the Morning Cloud, and like the early Dew which paſſeth away.</p>
            <p>This Turning from Evil, implies in it two Things; A forſaking of an evil Way, and a coming to a good One.</p>
            <p>From an evil Way the Children of Men cannot turn, unleſs they ſee that evil Way: For Example, a Perſon who has miſtaken his Way, muſt he not be made
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007199_0009_102B3ACC9046F630"/>
ſenſible of his Error, before he will endeavour to rectify his Miſtake? Yonder I ſee a Stranger in this our City, who thinks he is going to Church; but behold, the Court-Houſe or the Priſon brings him up: He begins firſt to doubt, whether he be right or not; then he believes he was wrong, ſo he turns back to the Road which leads to the Church. He who ſails down a River, in order to come to a City that is ſituated from him up the River, unleſs he ſees himſelf ſteering the wrong Courſe, and rectifies his Miſtake, will never arrive at the intended Place. So a Perſon who becomes really penitent, and is bent on forſaking his Evil; his Eyes are opened to ſee his miſerable Situation in an unrenewed State; his Sins are ſet before him in all their aggravating Circumſtances and moſt heinous Nature, for which he loathes and abhors himſelf.</p>
            <p>His Conſcience is then awakned, and laſh'd with the Curſes of God's Holy Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that thou, O Sinner, doſt complain within thyſelf,</p>

            <p>Tell me, convinced Sinner, can now thy own Righteouſneſs ſatisfy thee? Are not your beſt Performances an unclean Thing, and all your Righteouſneſs as filthy Rags?

            <p>When a Nation thus turns from their Evil, the Lord will repent of the Evil he thought to do unto them.—As forſaking God is the Cauſe of Deſtruction, ſo would returning unto him, be a Means to avoid the Evil that was denounced; in which Reſpect God is ſaid to repent:—Not as if he altered his eternal high Decree; no, he is an immutable God, and his Council ſhall ſtand firm for ever; and he doeth whatſoever pleaſeth him:—So that this Repentance in God, is to be underſtood in a Manner, becoming the Supreme Being; that is, with Relation to the external Diſpenſations of his Providences, wherein he acts thus, That, when a Nation or People is become exceeding ſinful, he denounces his Judgments againſt it, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it with Deſtruction; but upon Condition, they continue in their Diſobedience and Impiety: Which Condition is ſometimes more openly expreſſed, and ſometimes more ſecretly underſtood.—Ye Inhabitants of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> that great City, you exhibit us an Example of God's Dealings with the Children of Men.—<hi>Jonah</hi> the Prophet, was commiſſioned from Heaven to declare your Deſtruction: He cried, and ſaid, <hi>Yet Forty Days, and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</hi> But behold, upon your Repentance, though your Wickedneſs was come up before God in Heaven, the Lord ſpared you.—When you believed God, and proclaimed a Faſt, putting on Sackcloth, from the greateſt, even unto the leaſt of you: When your King, on hearing the Word of the Lord, roſe from his Throne, laid his royal Robe from him, and covered himſelf with Sackcloth, and ſat in Aſhes; ſaying, <hi>Let Man and Beaſt faſt, let them be covered with Sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil Way, and from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that is in their Hands: Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce Anger, that we periſh not? Then God ſaw your Works, that you turned from your evil Way; and God repented of the Evil that he had ſaid he would do unto you, and did it not.</hi>—O amazing Condeſcention of the Great God; be aſtoniſhed at it, O Heavens! that on Repentance of his miſerable ſinful Creatures, ſuch are the Bowels of his tender Compaſſion, he is ſaid himſelf to repent!</p>
            <p>And as true as this is, no leſs evident is the ſecond Thing, which is to be conſidered in the Text: That when God promiſes Bleſſings to a Nation, Kingdom or People. Irreligion, Impiety and Ungodlineſs, is a Means to marr and forego all thoſe Bleſſings, and to change them into a Curſe: <hi>For at what Inſtant, ſaith the Lord, I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to build and to plant it: If it do
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007199_0011_102B3AD09C5E5440"/>
Evil in my Sight, that it obey not my Voice, then I will repent of the Good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed is the Inſtant, happy the Conjuncture when auſpicious Heaven deigns to ſmile on a favourite Nation, its peculiar Darling: Then are holy Angels a tutelar Safeguard in the Midſt of it, and all around its Borders; evil Spirits, <hi>who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to and fro, up and down the Earth, ſeeking whom they may deſtroy,</hi> are reſtrained. The planetary Regions ſhed forth benign Influences, to foſter and fructify thoſe Quarters of the Earth which are allotted to its Heritage: It multiplies and branches out into Ten Thouſands Millions and Myriads; Health, Wealth, Honour and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, dwell every where within its far and wide extended Limits; Peace and Plenty find a palladian Habitation within its Boundaries.—The Rulers are noble, great, wiſe and good Men, ſincere Worſhippers of the Deity; the People are loyal, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, frugal, benevolent, pious, fearing God, and eſchewing Evil: They become honourable to their Neighbours, worthy to their Allies, formidable to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, lovely to their God.—</p>
            <p>And if this were not enough, God ſpeaks, to build and to plant; to eſtabliſh, to proſper, and to bleſs them yet more and more, by increaſing their Happineſs, and by rendering it laſting and durable. Nor would the Portion of an <hi>Eſau,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I have much,</hi> be their chief Good or ſole Comfort; but the Bleſſing of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who could ſay, <hi>I have all,</hi> ſhould crown their Felicity.—Godlineſs with Contentment, is great Gain; it is profitable unto all Things, having Promiſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.—And that I may ſum up the Whole; every Thing would conſpire to render them, (if our Pilgrim State on Earth, while we wade through a tempeſtuous Gulf, a Chaos of Vanity of Vanities, <hi>for all below is Vanity,</hi> ſaith the Preacher; will allow this Epithet,) A HAPPY PEOPLE, whoſe very Adverſities and Afflictions would tend to their Good.—</p>

And then, may they not drive us into the <hi>Atlantic Ocean,</hi> or ſcatter us to and fro, upon the Hills and Mountains; or in the vaſt Deſart, as Sheep purſued by Evening Wolves?</p>
            <p>I ſee a ſeething Pot in the North, that may boil over upon us, and ſcorch us in a moſt diſmal Manner.—Out of the North an Evil may break forth upon all the Inhabitants of the Land: The Families of the Kingdoms of the North, may execute God's Judgments againſt us, touching all our Wickedneſs, in forſaking God, and worſhipping the Works of our own Hands.</p>
            <p>High Time is it therefore that we repent, and <hi>turn from our evil Way, and make our Ways and our Doings good.</hi>—Our Sins and Abominations are very great; the Cry thereof cometh up before God in Heaven; which appears but too glaringly.—</p>
            <p>Is not the Land infected by Perſons tainted with wicked and ungodly Principles? Are there not many Fools, who ſay in their Heart, there is no God? Are there not many who diſbelieve, who mock and redicule his Revelation? Do Men not rob God of his Glory, and throw it away upon the Creature? Is not Atheiſm, Deiſm, and Infidelity, ſpread among us far and near? Is not a Latitudinarian Way of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking, become the faſhionable Religion of the higheſt Mode, in this our evil Day?

            <p>As there is ſuch Corruption in Principle, can it be poſſible, in the Nature of Things, there ſhould be no Abominations in Practice?—Muſt not a bitter Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſend forth ſuch Streams? Whence elſe that horrid execrable Vice of taking God's ſacred Name in vain, of curſing and ſwearing impiouſly? Is it by many not reckoned as a Flouriſh of Speech, to ſet off their Words, with a <hi>by God,</hi> and a <hi>God Dam,</hi> though the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>he will not hold Guiltleſs thoſe who take his Name in vain:</hi> And it is to be believed, unleſs they repent, God will make their <hi>Damme,</hi> and <hi>God dam my Soul,</hi> the trueſt Words they ever ſpoke.</p>

I ſhall not ſpeak of the Perjury and falſe Oaths, under which our Land groans: Nor ſhall I aver that there are Perſons who have taken ſacred Oaths to execute their Offices faithfully; but have, by the Execution of them, rendered themſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn more than once.</p>
            <p>Do we reflect upon that daring and God-provoking Prophanation of the Sabbath-Day; it is ſhocking, to ſee how all Manner of Work is done on the ſame; and even the greateſt Enterprizes in the World, begun on that Day which we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to celebrate by holy Reſt.—How are the Means of Grace, the Ordinances of Salvation, ſlighted and deſpiſed; the publick Worſhip of God, not to ſpeak of private Devotion, neglected?</p>
            <p>I ſhall not now dwell upon all the Debaucheries; I paſs by in Silence, the Fraud and Deceit, the Theft and Injuſtice, the Violence and Oppreſſion ſo often commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among us. Nor ſhall I mention the Back-bitings, the Lying and Slander, the Hatred, Spite and Malice, with which we are infected: Nor ſhall I declaim againſt the Envy, the Animoſities and Heart burnings wherewith many Minds are inflamed.</p>
            <p>But that drinking to Exceſs, which is now become faſhionable, and of the higheſt Mode, I cannot, I may not, paſs by in Silence. It cries aloud to God in Heaven! How do rational Creatures thereby become half Brute and half Devil? It is an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto the Lord, and a Root of all Evil.—This Vice, above all others, promotes the Ruin and Deſtruction of a Nation, and deſtroys wretched beſotted Souls, who are enſlaved to it, to all Intents and Purpoſes.</p>

            <p>And why ſhould I mention more Particulars? Sins are committed againſt all the Commandments of God's holy Law.—And were we but ſenſible of it; did we but humble ourſelves before God, we might find Mercy with him.—But, alas! what aggravates our Evil, is the Abhorrence many have of genuine Repentance, and the Deteſtation of real, internal and experimental Piety.—It is not enough with many, that they themſelves will not preſs into the Kingdom of Heaven, but they alſo endeavour to hinder, with Might and Main, ſuch as perhaps would.—O ye Enemies to real and experimental Religion, what do ye mean? If you are to be ſaved (for ſuch is your Hope, which I would to God was better grounded) in your Latitudinarian Way, do you not think the Profeſſors of experimental Religion, ſhall be happy too? Is it not to be believed, a juſt and holy God, will crown ſincere Endeavours after Holineſs, with a Reward in the other World, ſuitable to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes made in this State of Probation. Nay, if it ſhould unluckily ſo happen, that you fall ſhort of eternal Happineſs, do ye not conceive others who had more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion than you, may arrive ſafe on the happy Shore of eternal Felicity, in Heaven's ever bleſſed Harbour? Why, in the Name of Wonder! do ye then ſeem to bleſs your Lot above that of the ſincere Worſhippers of the Deity? Unenvied by me be for ever your better Portion of Vanity in this tragical World!</p>
            <p>O that the Lord of his infinite Mercy, graciouſly would be pleaſed to ſend his holy Spirit into the Hearts of many, to work in them genuine Repentance! Should I launch out into Futurity, and open to you the different Scenes of the other World: Should I ſet before your Eyes the Horrors and Ignominies of the diſmal Abyſs, in which the accurſed Crew ſuffer everlaſting Condemnation: Should I ſpeak of the Glories of the <hi>New Jeruſalem:</hi> Should I dwell on the Beatitudes of the celeſtial ever-bleſſed <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and ſay ſo much of unutterable Things, as on this Side of immortality I can: Yea, ſhould one, either Angel or Man, come from the other World, and propheſy to you, unleſs God darted Light and Life into thy Soul: O irregenerate Sinner, it would perhaps not bring thee as far as <hi>Bileam,</hi> who wiſhed

to die the Death of the Righteous; or as <hi>Felix,</hi> who trembled; or as <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who was almoſt perſuaded. It is not with me, but unto God, who calleth the Things that are not as if they were, doth it appertain, to bring into the World a new Creature of his own; of which old Things are paſſed away, behold all Things are become new.—I ſhall therefore at preſent, only urge the Neceſſity of a genuine and ſpeedy Repentance from the Drift of my Text: That, upon Repentance, God will ſpare a ſinful People, againſt whom he has denounced his Judgments; and upon Apoſtacy, he will deſtroy a People, he has vouchſafed to bleſs and proſper.—</p>
            <p>Oh, conſider! if we do not repent from our evil Way, turn unto the Lord, and make our Ways and Doings good; he may at laſt, give us over to be a Prey to our incroaching, ambitious, haughty and cruel Neighbours, the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians.</hi> I have already ſhewn you, God acted ſo with <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And that he has threatened and warned us by bitter Diſpenſations of his Providence, during the late War, both by the Sword of the Enemy, and by his own immediate afflicting Hand, (witneſs the Depredations the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians,</hi> by their Incurſions, have made upon our Northern Frontiers: witneſs the Small-Pox and Meaſels; witneſs that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, virulent and malignant Fever, whereby ſo many went to their long Homes,) and doth now, in an eſpecial Manner, warn us; I am ſorry to ſay, were a leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than grievous Taſk to ſhew.—I believe the Idea yourſelves have of our preſent Situation at this critical Juncture, at this dubious Inſtant, in this portentous Interval, is ſuch, that I need not particularize, in order to make you ſenſible of the Cloud which hangs over our Heads, in-ſo-far as to confeſs:—</p>

Will thy Juſtice not require Vengeance on our Sins and Abominations? Our Warriours who ſhould withſtand the Enemy, have they Reaſon to think God will ſend his holy Angels to protect them, and to put their Adverſaries to Flight?
