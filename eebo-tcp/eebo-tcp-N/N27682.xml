            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is better to go to the houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than to the houſe of feaſting, is the obſervation of one, who was well acquainted with human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and capable of giving excellent directions for the conduct of human life. That this is ſuch an houſe, appears from the ſadneſs of every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, proceeding from real ſorrow of heart and the ſymbols of mourning conſpicuous to every eye. To ſuggeſt ſome ſeaſonable thoughts, on this mournful occaſion, is the buſineſs of the ſpeaker; and that he may be better able to arrange his ideas and fix the attention of his hearers, he will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a compariſon between the greateſt man in the Eaſt and the greateſt man in the Weſt, whoſe death is this day univerſally lamented, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the remembrance of his virtues thouſands, nay millions, are aſſembled.</p>
            <p>THE paſſage I ſhall ſelect from the ſacred vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume for my text, you may find in
<q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>DEUTERONONY 34 Chap. part of the 5.7.8. verſes.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Moſes the ſervant of the Lord died. Moſes was an hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the children of Iſrael wept for Moſes.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>SO died Moſes at an advanced period, without feeling thoſe decays, which have been the portion of the human kind in every age: So died WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON in the full poſſeſſion of his mental pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036897_0004_100B2ECEE766CEA8"/>
and without any material decay in his ſenſes or his limbs, at an age, when ſuch an exemption could hardly be expected. I do not know that there was any thing miraculous in either. They both, early in life, adopted ſuch principles and purſued ſuch a courſe as had a direct tendency to protract life, as far as within the reach of human ability, and to prevent the natural decays of age.</p>
            <p>THEY were both favoured with good natural conſtitutions; they were both temperate in all things; they were both abundant in labours; they were both men of piety and unſpotted virtue; and of conſequence enjoyed eaſy and quiet minds, without anxiety and without vexation; they both went to the grave in peace.</p>
            <p>BUT they did not reſemble each other more in their deaths, than they did in their lives. They were both born for public life, they filled impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtations with dignity to themſelves and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to mankind. We ſhall deſcend to a few particulars in which the reſemblance appears.</p>
            <p>MOSES was a man of great modeſty and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diffident of his own abilities to fill the ſtation to which he was called. He declined the arduous taſk aſſigned him, as far as prudence and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to unerring Wiſdom would permit. Had he gone any farther, his modeſty would have been converted into obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was equally diffident and diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his qualifications for the important work to which he was called. It was impoſſible for him to be without his fears, that the ſpirit of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, which pervaded all orders of men, would
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036897_0005_100B2ED06C782F90"/>
decline, if not die, and that the people would grow weary of ſuffering and wiſh to return to their former ſtate. Succeſs was what he could not command, how well ſoever he might deſerve it. If he had failed at an early period, the moſt ignominious death muſt have been his portion. If he had had an hundred lives, juſtice, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would have ſaid, demanded them all. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort of the unanimous voice of the Congreſs, of the army, and the people, could have drawn him from his beloved retirement. He made up his mind on the moſt mature conſideration, and came forth, determined to deliver his brethren from their oppreſſions and their fears, or periſh in the attempt. The joy expreſſed at his acceptance of the command of our armies, was nearly equal to the grief that has been manifeſted at his death.</p>
            <p>IF he had been appointed like Moſes immediately by Heaven, we could not have put much greater confidence in him. Unanimity was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; unanimity ſaved us. It is true, the <hi>Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's</hi> maxim, uttered at an early period, was in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mouth: <hi>"United we ſtand, divided we fall."</hi> But this maxim would have had but little effect, if we had not had a leader to give it force.</p>
            <p>MOSES was a man of great prudence.</p>
            <p>HE was cool in his temper, deliberate in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, a raſh word ſeldom, if ever, proceeded from his lips; nor did the want of foreſight and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion plunge him into difficulties and embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſuch a degree, as to wound his reputation and prevent ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:036897_0006_100B2ED29100B110"/>WASHINGTON had the moſt important qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of an able general, a wiſe diſcernment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt things difficult and impracticable. To ſhrink from the former is weakneſs, to attempt the latter madneſs. Such was his wiſdom of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, he had but little occaſion for that of rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy. His uncommon ſobriety, unremitted atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and continual activity, preſerved him from hurtful errors and miſtakes. He lived not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without thought, nor was any thing put off till to-morrow that could be done to-day. Though he heard every thing, yet this did not prevent his ſeeing every thing, ſo far as circumſtances would permit. He always conſidered the eye of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral more influential than his words. Where danger was moſt imminent, and his preſence moſt needed, there his exertions were moſt conſpicuous. As he never avoided the poſt of danger, he led others to conſider it a poſt of honour. Great prudence was neceſſary to form a union in the American army, compoſed, as it was, of raw, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined troops, drawn from different quarters, poſſeſſed of different principles, habits and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and all in a great degree void of that ſpirit of ſubordination abſolutely neceſſary in an army. Theſe difficulties were all ſurmounted, and nearly as much harmony was found in the American as in the Britiſh camp, without that loſs of ſpirit, that is often, if not always, found in thoſe who have been drilled to the ſervice by the ſevereſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. The Americans, taken from the fields of freedom, could not bear that ſeverity of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline frequently found in veteran armies. Our
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036897_0007_100B2ED41539F1D8"/>
prudent leader conformed to their humours and their habits, ſo far as public ſafety would permit, and by ſo doing he was obeyed more from affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than fear.</p>
            <p>MOSES was a man of fortitude. His courage never forſook him, though his ſituation was often diſtreſſing and his proſpect gloomy. He was early convinced there was no ſafety but in perſeverance. To look back was death or worſe.</p>
            <p>THE courage of the American chief was never doubted by friend or foe. If it had been, it would totally have diſqualified him for his place. The want of perſonal bravery is a weakneſs in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral not to be forgiven. WASHINGTON on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions had the perfect command of himſelf. He never fled when duty called him to purſue, nor did he quit the ground as long as any hope of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory remained. During the firſt ſtages of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, his courage and ſkill were more conſpicuous in his retreats than in his victories. Theſe were conducted in ſuch manner, that the enemy profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but little by the victories they won and the advantages they gained. A defenſive mode of war he adopted, as being the only mode the Americans were able to purſue, and which he was well aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would lead to conqueſt in the end. It is time and ſervice that makes ſoldiers; it is danger that creates courage; it is hardſhip that makes men hardy. The American army muſt grow better with time, the Britiſh decay. The Americans will conquer if they are not conquered, was his maxim.</p>
            <p>THE patriotiſm of the Jewiſh lawgiver equalled his fortitude. His patriotiſm was of the virtuous
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036897_0008_100ADD0F1A1108E0"/>
kind. It was the firſt wiſh of the Jewiſh leader to deliver his brethren from oppreſſion and ſlavery. Avarice and ambition were not in his heart, nor was the deſire of making conqueſts, like ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern republics, the ruling paſſion of his mind. Could he ſee his friends and compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions in the poſſeſſion of freedom, he was content. As to himſelf, while he dwelt in Pharaoh's court he had nothing to endure, nor any thing to fear. He was too important to be inſulted or neglected; and we know of no reaſon that he had to dread a change of circumſtances: "But Moſes choſe rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon." We commend his choice, and do moſt ſincerely wiſh that ſuch patriots may increaſe in the old world and in the new.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was not inferior to Moſes in this amiable virtue. If ever there was a man in the world, who diſcovered a truly patriotic ſpirit, who ſpent life for the good of his country and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, who expoſed his health, hazarded his life, and every thing dear to him of a temporal nature, WASHINGTON was the man. Hiſtory furniſhes no inſtance of a man, who went beyond him in a truly public and patriotic ſpirit. Poſſeſſed of an ample fortune, he might have lived much at his eaſe. Books, a few ſelect friends, and rural em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, in which his ſoul delighted, would have made him as happy as the preſent ſtate of things would permit; but he choſe rather to riſk his fortune with that of his brethren, than enjoy the pleaſures his circumſtances afforded him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:036897_0009_100B2ED969DA7E28"/>MOSES was a man of great humanity. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the general tenor of his conduct. If in ſome inſtances there is the appearance of ſeverity, it is owing to neceſſity or peculiar circumſtances, and not to a cruel diſpoſition. Time will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to deſcend to particulars.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was equally humane. He might have obtained more glory in the opinion of ſome, if he had been more laviſh of human blood. He nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er expoſed his men to danger any farther than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity required, or there was an hopeful proſpect of obtaining ſome permanent advantage. Leſs blood, perhaps, was never ſhed in a war ſo complicated, ſo lengthy, and for the moſt part carried on againſt ſuperior numbers. It was his humanity that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to ſecure the affections of the army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is common. This affection, principally, held the army together during certain periods of ſuffering all the pains of hunger, cold, nakedneſs, and incapacity of making any great reſiſtance, if the enemy had known their weakneſs, and been diſpoſed to attack them with their whole force. His pathetic entreaties more than once detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the men in camp after their enliſtments were expired. They could not forſake their general, who was willing to ſpend and be ſpent for the good of the army and the happineſs of his country.</p>
            <p>MOSES was as much diſtinguiſhed for his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as for any other quality of his mind. Our children are not badly inſtructed, when in their infancy or early childhood, they are taught that MOSES excelled all in this amiable diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:036897_0010_100B2EDC26B40908"/>WASHINGTON in this reſpect was not inferior to Moſes. Paſſions he had, and they, who have been beſt acquainted with him, ſay they were ſtrong. This we can eaſily believe, for ſuch are always found in ſtrong minds. It was the firſt leſſon of his life, to reduce them to reaſon. He effected it; and this paved the way to promotion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him to take the command of his brethren. When his ſpirit was ſtirred within him and his heart waxed hot, the ſinger of ſilence reſted on his lips. He early learnt what the moſt paſſionate are willing to acknowledge, that nothing is well done in anger, that raſhneſs in action lays a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for repentance at leiſure. If he was not ſo deciſive as ſome; by accuſtoming himſelf always to think, he made fewer miſtakes than others. His foreſight and attention prevented the neceſſity of doing things twice in order to be wiſe.</p>
            <p>MOSES was as much diſtinguiſhed in the cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inet, as in the field. He was the greateſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, the world had ever ſeen. He formed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public under which the people for a long time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed an uncommon ſhare of liberty and ſafety, and which might have continued much longer than it did, if the wantonneſs of ſome and the wickedneſs of others had not led them to wiſh for a change.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was as much reſpected at the head of our councils, as he had been at the head of our armies. As he had been firſt in war, ſo he was firſt in peace. The people, though divided in every thing elſe, united in chooſing him their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident, and in ſuch manner as was ſeldom if ever
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036897_0011_100B2EDDAB792A68"/>
known before, and the like is hardly to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again. Among many men ſcattered over an immenſe tract of country, poſſeſſing different views, intereſts, and habits, there was but one mind. The voice of millions was conſidered by our great friend and patron as the voice of God, and he conſented to take the helm when the ſhip was ſuppoſed to be in great danger. His prudence, patience, and fortitude leſſened, if it did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate, the ſpirit of party; and all orders uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the benefit of the republic. Many had ſuppoſed, during the conteſt, that when the rod that had been held over us, was removed, our lot would be that of the Grecian ſtates, who waged perpetual war with each other. The Federal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution laid a foundation for perpetual union. WASHINGTON was at the head, when it was fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the commencement of its adminiſtration was committed to his hands, and he continued in office longer than he intended, becauſe he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to quit the helm in a ſtorm. The line he adopted, when it was extremely difficult to determine what courſe it was beſt to purſue, has (under Providence) ſaved this nation from the calamities of a dreadful war, and enabled us to enjoy a great ſhare of peace, and as large a portion of temporal proſperity as the world has ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>WHEN war broke out in Europe, our polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Father thought it beſt that America ſhould obſerve the line of neutrality. By taking an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part, we had every thing to loſe and nothing to gain. The voice of the people, if I miſtake not, was for war; they have ſince been convinced
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036897_0012_100B2EDFEC005BC8"/>
of their miſtake. If we had engaged, we ſhould probably have loſt all that we had gained, and both our circumſtances and proſpects would have been infinitely worſe, than they were before the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began. The war has not yet ended, and we cannot ſay how or when it will. The principles that were firſt adopted by the French revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts appear to be nearly abandoned by thoſe now in power, and all hope of eſtabliſhing a free repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic is at an end. Let them adopt what form they may, military deſpotiſm muſt continue for ſome length of time. By obſerving the line of neutral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, we have ſuffered; but nothing, it is probable, to what we ſhould have done, if we had been weak enough to have engaged in war. The enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the two great rival powers has been the ſource of nearly all our ſufferings; but they have not been ſo great, as they would have been, if we had joined with one ſide or the other. They have divided the people, it is true, but the probability is, that we ſhall ſoon be on pretty good terms with both. We have reaſon to hope that our Envoys will be well received; if not, the good we have already received from the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is more than a balance for the expenſe.</p>
            <p>ONE thing, that I cannot forbear mentioning, that tends much to exalt the character of our late beloved Preſident, is, the impartial world, that have been acquainted with his public movements of every kind, and have had opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all his motives, have not in a ſingle inſtance, that I recollect, condemned his conduct; and I doubt not, but that we ſhall hear, that his death is conſidered as a loſs to the human race.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:036897_0013_100B2EE20AA5E038"/>MOSES was a man of piety, religion and moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. And ſo was WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>HE was never heard vauntingly to ſay, My wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, my courage, my zeal, have vanquiſhed all my enemies. My arm hath gotten me the victory.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand; My God, my officers, my ſoldiers, the good ſenſe and firm conduct of my fellow-citizens, in the cabinet and in the field, have crowned my labours with ſome ſucceſs, was the language of his heart and his lips. He was no ſophiſt, nor atheiſt. If he had been, his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have done infinite harm; it might have given a tone to the faith and manners of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The prevalence of infidelity in Europe, we have reaſon to hope, will be followed with ſome happy conſequences. It has nearly extirpated that ſpirit of credulity and ſuperſtition which for a long time diſgraced the Chriſtian religion and threatned its total deſtruction. In plucking up the tares, in popiſh countries, the wheat has been plucked up with them. The tares were ſo numerous and ſo rank, that this could not be well avoided. Thanks to Heaven! the good ſeed is not loſt, the ground remains, and we are not without hope, that it may be prepared in ſuch manner, that when the good ſeed is ſown, it ſhall bring forth an hundred fold. If the ways of Heaven are often dark and unſearchable, one thing is certain, the general good is invariably purſued.</p>
            <p>IN ſome things, the Jewiſh lawgiver and the American chief bore but little reſemblance. Moſes had only to follow the directions of an infallible Guide. His path was ſo plainly marked by Heaven,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036897_0014_100B2EE4444809F0"/>
that it was nearly impoſſible for him to miſtake it. Not ſo with our patron and friend: he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to keep his invention always upon the rack. Not a moment was allowed him for relaxation and repoſe beyond what nature abſolutely requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He was as thoughtful on the day of victory as on the day of defeat. Orders, it is true, he often received, but of neceſſity they muſt be often diſcretionary, eſpecially as to ways and means of carrying them into execution. He might find himſelf under a neceſſity of diſregarding them; to do this, in his reſponſible ſituation, might be as painful to him, as it was to our Envoys in France when they were negotiating a peace with Britain. It is true, he was allowed to depart from orders, as circumſtances or imperious neceſſity demanded; but to be always ready to take the advantage of circumſtances, required continual attention.</p>
            <p>THIS one thing, the taking advantage of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, diſtinguiſhes the character of a general more, perhaps, than any other that can be named. Without a good ſhare of prudence of this kind, the moſt brilliant talents, in other reſpects, will never command ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>MOSES was conſtantly aided by miracles. The elements were at his command, the heavens fought in his favour. WASHINGTON had no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect aſſurance from the Deity, that he would lead him on to victory, and crown his labours with ſucceſs. He believed his cauſe to be juſt, but this afforded him no abſolute ſecurity againſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. If he had owned the <hi>box</hi> early in life, that he returned to the Donor at his death, this would have convinced him, if conviction was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036897_0015_100B2EE5ED693E80"/>
wanted, that the moſt prudent, patriotic and brave, may be unfortunate, and ſuffer an ignominious death. He never expected that miracles would be wrought in his favour. He could not ſay as Moſes did, when hemmed in on every ſide, <hi>Stand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi> At the ſame time, he and we, in a thouſand inſtances, have noticed the hand of Heaven viſibly diſplayed in our favour. My time will not allow me to deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances, that made a deep impreſſion at the moment, on the minds of ſuch as then lived, and never will be forgotten.</p>
            <p>THE gift, or rather loan of ſuch a man, in our particular circumſtances, was a favour beyond eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation. If we had been allowed to ſearch the world, one more ſuitable to the exigencies of the times, we have good reaſon to believe, could not have been found. That he was continued ſo long, and made ſo uſeful to the laſt day of his life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our warmeſt gratitude. Though it was never our wiſh, that he ſhould paſs through a ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond childhood, and ſpend the laſt of life in a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs way, bereft of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and of ſenſe; yet his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval at the preſent period is a loſs, that we have great reaſon to lament. The conduct of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States this day evinces beyond contradiction, that they are ſenſible of the loſs they have ſuſtained. Were he, who wept at the grave of Lazarus, with us at the preſent moment, he would undoubtedly mingle his tears with ours. We commend rulers and people for devoting this day to mourning. Our public conduct has a tendency to wipe off the reproach that has been frequently caſt on republics, <hi>that they are ungrateful.</hi> Pecuniary rewards for his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036897_0016_100B2EE78959B8F8"/>
ſervices he would never receive. To perpetuate the memory of his virtues, is all the reward we are allowed to give. To benefit the deceaſed we do not expect; he is gone beyond our reach. To promote the happineſs of the living, the riſing generation in particular, and the children yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, is what we have in view. We ſay to all, this day, who wiſh to live beloved and die lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>"Go and do likewiſe."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL orders of men may in ſome degree be ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efited by his example, let their ſphere of life be what it may. He was as exemplary in private life as he was in public. His example has made that line of life honorable, which, as we expect to become a great and flouriſhing people muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to beyond all others. Commerce we ſhall have, but commerce in ſuch a country as this, without agriculture, can never be gainful. A price is put into our hands, God grant that we may have wiſdom to improve it.</p>
            <p>Let us all take the warning that is given us. In a ſhort time we ſhall all be upon a level. As we wiſh to be lamented when dead, it behoves us to be uſeful while living. To prepare for our paſſage is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead who die in the Lord, they reſt from their labours and their works do follow them.</hi>
