            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE are the Words of our Bleſſed Saviour. The occaſion of them was this. One of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſaid unto Him, <hi>Maſter, Speak to my Brother, that he divide the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance with me.</hi> Some Expoſitors ſuppoſe that he intended to injure his brother. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that be, our Lord informs him that he came to a wrong Perſon, <hi>Man, Who made me a Judge, or a divider over you?</hi> Chriſt's Kingdom was not of this World, nor did He take to Himſelf a Civil Authority to judge, and diſpoſe of Men's civil Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. No, He came into the World to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe an Heavenly Inheritance for His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001997_0003_0FBA4F026790B538"/>and to give them a ſure Title to it; but not to Settle their Earthly Poſſeſſions. Tho' He was the <hi>Lord and Heir of all things; yet He had not where to lay his head.</hi> And He calls upon His Diſciples to be ready to forſake all, and follow Him.</p>
            <p>No doubt our Saviour diſcerned Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Worldly Spirit in this Man, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſeeking to Him about the Spiritual concerns of his Immortal Soul, was ſo Eager to have Him concern himſelf in his temporal Affairs which was a thing forein from that great Errand upon which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt came into the World. Our Saviour therefore takes this Opportunity to Caution his Hearers againſt <hi>Covetouſneſs. Take heed,</hi> The Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>is often referr'd to the Mind. It ſignifies, to behold with our bodily Eyes, and alſo with the Eye of the Soul, <hi>the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> To ſee a thing with Conſideration, and Obſervation, to Know. And ſometimes it is rendred, Take heed, and <hi>Obſerve your ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Beware:</hi> The Word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſignifies to keep Watch, to keep as a Priſon is kept, to take heed or beware of "<hi>Preſerve your ſelves</hi> from <hi>Covetouſneſs.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The word ſignifies; ſays <hi>Beza,</hi> an immoderate deſire of getting, even with the Detriment of others. It is tranſlated, <hi>greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Eph.</hi> 4.19. It ſignifieth an unlawful
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001997_0004_0FBA4F13452DAB18"/>deſire of having more; Word for Word, a <hi>having more.</hi> It is here tranſlated <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs.</hi> Which is <hi>an undue Valuation of,</hi> and <hi>immoderate craving this World's Goods.</hi> This Sin diſcovers it ſelf in an Exceſſive Eſteem of Worldly Riches, in an Idolatrous truſt and confidence placed in them; in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous acts, and the taking unlawful Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for the getting of Wealth; and in an immoderate Love to it, and delight in it when gotten; and a criminal backwardneſs and unwillingneſs to part with it to Pious, Publick, and Charitable Uſes. It diſcovers it ſelf alſo in a Diſcontentment with God's Allotment, and an irregular Endeavour after more than God-is pleas'd to allow us: In beholding our Neighbours Eſtate with a Covetous Eye; <hi>our Eye being Evil becauſe God is good.</hi> It diſcovers it ſelf in an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Solicitude of Mind about getting and keeping; in an inordinate fear of loſing what we have gotten, and in exceſſive grief upon the account of Worldly loſſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments. This Sin diſcovers it ſelf in a Niggardly with-holding from our ſelves that which is Meet for our comfortable and decent Subſiſtence; and in with holding from others that which the Law of Charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to beſtow upon them: or in the temper and diſpoſition with which we give; when we do it grudgingly, and not of a ready Mind. The Doctrine may be this.</p>

               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <q>It is a great Duty incumbent on us, to take heed, and beware of the Sin of Covetouſneſs.</q>
               <p>Under this Doctrine, We may Conſider what it is to take heed, and beware of Covetouſneſs. And then offer a few things to ſhew the Obligations we are under to beware of this Sin.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>What is it to take heed, and beware of Covetouſneſs?</hi> When may we be ſaid to Obey this Command?</p>
               <p>For anſwer to this Inquiry.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To take heed, and beware of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs implies, <hi>That we heedfully obſerve the Temper of our Minds; and Examine whether this Luſt doth not prevail in us.</hi>
                     <p>If we would take heed, and beware of this Evil, We muſt obſerve our ſelves Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; We muſt compaſs a diligent Search, and look narrowly into the State of our Souls, and ſeriouſly Conſider whether this I fiſt have not the Poſſeſſion of us. The Diſtemper muſt be known, the wound <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, before a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedy can be applied. Our hearts are naturally <hi>deceitful, and deſparately wicked.</hi> A
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001997_0006_0FBA4F1865404528"/>deceived heart oftentimes leads Men aſide when they are not duely ſenſible of it. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, Men are very prone to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this iniquity. How often doth it lie hid under the Specious Names of <hi>Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and good Husbandry? How often are Men guilty of it under a fair pretence of a due concern about their Temporal Affairs? Certainly then if we would beware of this Sin, we muſt turn the Eyes of the Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and by a reflex act of the Mind look and ſee whether this Luſt doth not give Law to us in the Courſe of our lives; or at leaſt, in ſome degree, prevail. We ſhould Pray to God to Search us; and we ſhould ſearch and try our ways, that we may know if this way of wickedneſs be found in us. We muſt put that general Rule into practice reſpecting this particular Caſe; 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, — prove your own ſeves. Know ye not your own ſelves,</hi> — We ſhould Examine by the rules of God's Word, whether our Deſire, Eſteem and Truſt be not inordinately plac'd on Worldly Riches; whether our hearts do not go out after them with too much Vehemency; and whether our purſuit of them be not too Eager and Earneſt.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>We muſt look to our ſelves, and Watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Firſt Motion and Inclination of our hearts towards this dreadful Evil.</hi> We muſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001997_0007_0FBA4F235E563C40"/>watch that we may Eſpy and Suppreſs this hurtful Luſt in the beginning and riſe of it; that it may not Conceive and bring forth. We ſhould labour to ſtifle theſe Corrupt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations in the birth, and not ſuffer them to grow, and gather ſtrength. It is difficult to raiſe our Minds to heavenly things, and to ſet our Affections on things above; but the deſcent is Eaſy, and the Motion of the Soul towards the Earth as it's Centre, will be ſo much the Stronger and Swifter by how much the longer it is continued, and by how much the nearer we approach to it in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and affections. Here then it is a good Rule, <hi>Obſta Principiis,</hi> Reſiſt this Sin in the beginning of it. And for this End we ſhould be jealous over our ſelves with a godly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>By the Grace of God, we muſt Mortify the inward Inclination and Principle; that Root of bitterneſs whereby we are defiled.</hi>
                     <p>This is implied in the duty which we are here Exhorted to. There are the fruitful Seeds of all Sin in our Corrupt Natures. Our <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin</hi> is the Root from whence all <hi>Actual Tranſgreſſions</hi> do Spring. Now we muſt ſtrike at the Root. We muſt Cry to God for the influences of His Holy Spirit to ſubdue our Corruptions. By the Spirit we muſt Mortify the deads of the Fleſh, and change the corrupt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001997_0008_0FBA4F2604C02FC0"/>biaſs of our Minds, whereby we are inclin'd to this, and other Sins. Particular Luſts are as the Limbs or Members of that body of Death which is in us; and we muſt by the Spirit Mortify them. Col. 3.5. <hi>Mortify therefore your Members which are upon the Earth;</hi> Fornication — and <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> which is Idolatry. It is not enough that this Luſt be <hi>Reſtrain'd</hi> as to the outward acts, and more Notorious out-breakings of it; but it muſt be <hi>Crucified and Slain.</hi> It muſt be put off, and laid aſide. By looking to JESUS in the Exerciſe of Faith we ſhould draw Strength from Him, who is our Head of Influence, to Subdue this Sin in the Principle of it, that it may not reign in our Mortal Bodies. We muſt Pray that we may Experience the Power of Chriſt's death, this Sin being Nail'd to his Croſs and Crucified with Him.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>We muſt heedfully obſerve our Temptations to this Sin, and beware of yielding to them.</hi>
                     <p>Many are the Temptations which our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Adverſary the Devil makes uſe of to draw us into this Sin; and therefore we muſt be Watchful, not being ignorant of his devices; and reſiſt him ſtedfaſtly in the Faith. He that will careleſsly run into the way of Temptation, will be in the utmoſt Danger of being foil'd and over-come. Now there is no Condition or Circumſtance of Life that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001997_0009_0FBA4F27708E7F08"/>is Exempted from this Temptation. If we are riſing in the World, and have fulneſs of buſineſs, we may be tempted to Conſume too much of our Time and Tho'ts in the Eager purſuit of Earthly things, under this pretence, that when we have gotten a great Eſtate, We will then <hi>Seek the things which are Above:</hi> Whereas we are Commanded to ſeek <hi>Firſt</hi> the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs. And he that will not do this <hi>Preſently,</hi> hath no true deſire to do it <hi>at all.</hi> We muſt therefore Watch againſt ſuch a Temptation as this. Again, If we have gotten <hi>an Eſtate,</hi> Satan will be ready to tempt us <hi>to deny God,</hi> and to ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> To make <hi>Idols</hi> of our Silver and Gold, and to bow down and worſhip them. And thus alſo if we are <hi>Poor,</hi> Satan will be ready to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from hence to tempt us to Covet our Neighbours Goods; to <hi>Steal</hi> and <hi>take the Name of God in vain.</hi> This Luſt is call'd the Luſt of the <hi>Eye,</hi> and therefore we ſhould make a <hi>Covenant with our Eyes,</hi> and beware of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon any thing that is our Neighbour's, with an Envious, Coveting Eye. We ſhou'd Watch and Pray leſt we enter into this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

A Narrow contracted Spirit is in an eſpecial manner diſpos'd to this Vice. 2 Tim. 3.2. —<hi>Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,</hi> —! But now an heart inlarged in love to God and Men: an heart gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly inclined to do good to others; will fly this baſe Luſt. Such a Man will be freely willing to lay out himſelf, and to ſpend a ſuitable proportion of his Eſtate in doing good to others, inſtead of cleaving to it with an immoderate affection. As far as a ſelfiſh Spirit prevails, we ſhall think that loſt, which we beſtow on our Neighbour; and ſhall be ready to ſeek our <hi>own,</hi> without a due regard to <hi>his</hi> profit; yea by doing wrong to him. Whereas we are Exhorted, 1 Cor. 10.24. <hi>Let no Man ſeek his own, but every Man anothers Wealth.</hi> We muſt therefore ſeek after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary frame of Mind, a liberal and charitable Spirit: and watch for ſuitable opportunities to Exerciſe this Grace. We ſhould deviſe liberal things, be ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate. The more the Grace of Charity is ſtrongthned in us, the more will this vile affection be weakned: for theſe are contrary.</p>

As far as our love to Jeſus Chriſt, and our Eſteem of his Unſearchable Riches, do prevail; ſo far will our love of this World abate; and we ſhall not ſeek it with ſo much Earneſtneſs and Greedineſs.</p>

                     <p>There are Ordinances and Means of Grace appointed by God, in the diligent attendance upon which, the People of God are kept from falling, and preſerved blameleſs to his heavenly Kingdom. Theſe muſt therefore be diligently improved. We muſt look to it, and take heed that our worldly Cares and Buſineſs do not make us neglect them; or attend upon them in a cold and formal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If we would beware of Covetouſneſs,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001997_0012_0FBA4F3357A30E50"/>we muſt ſee to it that we do not rob God, and defraud our own Souls, by not allowing Sufficient time for religious Duties. We ſhould Read God's Word with Care, Attend upon the Preaching of it with Heedfulneſs and Conſtancy; not neglecting the Aſſembling our ſelves together for the Publick Worſhip of God. Pſal. 119.36. <hi>Incline my heart to thy Testimonies, and not to Covetonſneſs.</hi> Theſe two are here oppos'd, and therefore if we receive God's Word into good and honeſt hearts, we ſhall be delivered from this baſe Luſt. If we would beware of Coretouſneſs, we muſt diligently husband the Precious Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Golden Seaſons, which we enjoy on the Lord's Day: We ſhould Watch, and take heed that we be not hindred by the hurries of Worldly buſineſs from <hi>Remembring the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> and preparing for it. And thus we ſhould alſo be careful to Attend on the Publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities on other days, whether Stated or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional. Again, We muſt be inſtant in Prayer. We ſhould go to the Throne of Grace daily in Secret Prayer, to ask Grace and Strength to help us againſt this, and other Iniquities. We ſhould Cry to God that He would not lead us into Temptation to this Sin; but deliver us from this deadly Evil. We muſt Watch alſo, and ſee to it that we reſerve Sufficient and Seaſonable Time for Family-Prayer. If we ſuffer our Worldly buſineſs to ſhut out this <hi>Duty,</hi> the Spirit of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001997_0013_0FBA4F344EE873B8"/>the World hath already obtain'd a dreadful aſcendent over us, and will ſtill further prevail. Again, We ſhould take Time to Meditate on what we Read or Hear. In a particular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when we come from the Houſe of God on the Lord's Day, it would be very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for us to Retire, and Apply our Minds to the Truths we have heard, by cloſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; that theſe may be well digeſted, and ſo become Food and Nouriſhment to our Souls. To conclude this head, We ſhould ſeriouſly conſider of the Vanity of all Earthly things, of the Shortneſs, and Uncertainty of the Time of this preſent Life, which is the Only Time wherein we can enjoy them. We ſhould conſider that our Worldly Goods are Talents lent to us by God, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in His Service; and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed on our Luſts: And He will ſhortly call us to a ſtrict Account what uſe we have made of them. Such Meditations as theſe by God's bleſſing, might help to Mortify our inordinate love to this World and the things of it.</p>

II. <hi>Why ſhould we take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs? What Obligations are we under to beware of this Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>We muſt beware of Covetouſneſs, Becauſe Covetouſneſs is an hainous Iniguity, forbiden in the Law of God.</hi>
                     <p>Covetouſneſs is in Scripture call'd Idolatry, and is rank'd with ſome of the moſt atrocious Crimes. The <hi>Covetous Man ſays to Gold, Thou art my hope, and to fine Gold, Thon art my Confidence.</hi> Inſtead of making the Name of the Lord his ſtrong Tower, he makes Riches his ſtrong City; and they are as an high Wall in his Conceit. He gives his Earthly Poſſeſſions that Eſteem and Love, which are due to God alone. Surely then this Sin is hainous in the Sight of God. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is ſtrictly forbiden in His Word. The Tenth Commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Covet,</hi> —Eph. 5.3. But Fornication, and all Uncleanneſs, or <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> let it not be once named amongſt you, as becometh Saints. This Sin is ſo contrary to the Spirit of Chriſtianity; ſo unbecoming the holy Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints; that the Apoſtle would have them take care that it might not ſo much as once be ſaid that it was found among them.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>

2. <hi>Becauſe a Man's Life conſiſteth not in the Abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi>
                     <p>Thus it follows in the Verſe wherein is our Text. This is the Argument which our Bleſſed Saviour makes uſe of to diſſwade His Diſciples from this Sin; and there is great weight in it. The true Comfort of Life doth not flow from great Plenty, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it. No, <hi>Nature is Content with a little.</hi> If we have Food and Raiment, we may live joyfully; provided the temper of out Minds be ſuited to our Condition. The ground of true Peace, and good Living lies within; in a Spirit wean'd from the World, and reſign'd to the Diſpoſals of Providence. He is not the happy Man that hath a great Portion of the things of this World; but he that hath an heart to make a good uſe of that which he hath, and to take the Comfort of it. Now this is the Giſt of God. Eccl. 3. 13. <hi>And alſo that every man ſhould Eat and Drink, and Enjoy the</hi> good <hi>of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</hi> And this rich Gift is often befrowed on them that are not the Rich of this World; ſo that the little which a Righteous Man hath is better to him than the abundance of many wicked.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Covetouſneſs is a Sin which dreadfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files the Mind, and Expoſeth to other hurtful Luſts.</hi>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001997_0016_0FBA4F41895EDD60"/>
Where this undue Valuation of Earthly Riches prevails, it Eſtrangeth the heart from God, and renders it Earthly, Senſual, Deviliſh. It indiſpoſeth the Mind to all that is Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, and fills it with corrupt Deſires and vile Affections; Our worldly gain doth then become <hi>filthy lucre.</hi> We read, Mark 7.21. &amp; 23. <hi>From within, out of the heart of men proceed evil Thoughts, Adulteries, Fornications, Murders, Thefts, Covetouſneſs.</hi>—All theſe Evil things come from within, and deſile the Man. O Polluted Soul that lieſt grovelling in the duſt: How art thou debaſed! How art thou deſiled! And this Luſt leads to the Commiſſion of other Sins. 1 Tim. 6.9. <hi>But they that will be rich, fall into Temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts:</hi>—The immoderate deſire of Wealth many times prevails on Men to Lie, Steal, Oppreſs &amp; Over-reach their Neighbours. Yes, ſometimes to Murder them. Thus when <hi>Athan</hi> ſaw the goodly Babyloniſh Garment, and Two hundred. Shekels of Silver, and a Wedge of Gold; he Coveted, and took them, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 7. 21. Thus <hi>Ahab</hi> Coveted <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, and ſlew him.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>If we are under the government of this Sin We ſhall deſpiſe and reject the Offers of the Goſpel.</hi>
                     <p>In the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, periſhing Sinners have the Unſearchable Riches of Chriſt hid open, and freely offered to them upon the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001997_0017_0FBA4F429FE880B8"/>moſt reaſonable Terms. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt calls upon us to come to Him, that we may obtain <hi>durable Riches and Righteouſneſs.</hi> He hath purchaſed Spiritual Bleſſings ſuited and proportion'd to the Wants of our Souls; and offers to beſtow them upon all ſuch as are willing to receive them in the Goſpel-way. He calls upon us to Come and <hi>Buy without Money, and without Price.</hi> But that man whoſe heart goeth out after his Covetouſneſs, will have no heart, no inclination to Come and receive theſe Bleſſings. When invited to come to Chriſt, and feaſt on that Proviſion which He hath made, he will ſay, in his heart at leaſt, I muſt go to my Farm, to my Merchandize; pray have me Excus'd. Or if he doth come and ſit under the Outward Diſpenſation of the Word, yet he will not truly Come to Jeſus Chriſt that he may have Life. His caſe will be like that of the Young man, who, when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Sell that he had, and give to the Poor, <hi>Went away ſorrowful,</hi> Matth. 19.23. Now we muſt in the frame and temper of our Minds be ready to lay down all our Temporal Intereſts at Chriſt's feet; or we can't be His Diſciples. Luke 14.33.—<hi>Whoſoever he be of you, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> But how ſhall we be able to do this while the World hath the poſſeſſion of our hearts? It is as eaſy for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle. <hi>We can't ſerve God <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001997_0018_0FBA4F43D5AD6870"/>duſt of the Earth, we cannot hunger &amp; thirſt after Righteouſneſs; we ſhall not obey the Goſpel-call, and ſeek <hi>Firſt</hi> the Kingdom of God. If this Luſt prevails, it will choke the good Seed of the Word, ſo that we ſhall not bring forth fruit to perfection. Matth. 13.22. <hi>He that received Seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the Word, and the care of this World, and the deceitfulneſs of Riches choke the Word, and he becometh unfruitful.</hi> Worldly minded men may have ſome good Motions, ſome Convictions in hearing God's Word; but then alas! this treacherous Luſt renders them fruitleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>This Sin will Expoſe us to Sorrow in this Life, and if perſiſted in, to Eternal Miſery in the World to come.</hi>
                     <p>1. Tim. 6.10. <hi>For the love of Money is the root of all Evil; which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</hi> There is a Wo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſuch as live in this Sin: Wo to him that Coveteth an Evil Covetouſneſs:— There are many who by their greedy purſuit of worldly gain do pierce themſelves through with many Sorrows. God is provok'd to blaſt them in their worldly buſineſs, or to Curſe their bleſſings. And in the concluſion they will be Miſerable indeed. When the Covetous man may be ready to bleſs himſelf with the rich
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001997_0019_0FBA4F458270DCD8"/>Fool, and to ſay, Soul thou haft much goods laid up for many Years; take thine Eaſe, Eat, Drink and be Merry; then GOD may ſay, Thou Fool this Night ſhall thy Soul be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of thee, <hi>For ſo is he that layeth up Treaſure for himſelf; and is not Rich towards God.</hi> By this Sin the Souls of Multitudes have been plung'd into Perdition. The Laws of Men do not puniſh this Abominable Vice; but tho' ſuch Sinners may Eſcape the Puniſhment of Men, yet they can't Eſcape the righteous Judgment of God. O No! They that live and die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt and dominion of this Sin, muſt be ſhut out of Heaven, and ſuffer the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Eternal fire. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5, 6. For this ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor-Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon, nor <hi>Covetous man who is an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God.</hi> Let no Man deceive you with vain Words; for becauſe of theſe things cometh the Wrath of God upon the Children of diſobedience. And Riches will not profit in that day of Wrath.</p>
