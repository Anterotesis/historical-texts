            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Narrative OF Jeremiah Meacham.</head>
            <p>THE Man that occaÅ¿ioned the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the EnÅ¿uing Sermon, was Born at, or near <hi>Salem,</hi> and Lived there, and in Å¿everal other places of <hi>BoÅ¿ton</hi> Province near half his Dayes, before he came into <hi>Rhode-IÅ¿land</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, where he Married and continued, until he was more than Forty Years Old.</p>
            <p>FurniÅ¿hed with a good Natural UnderÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and a Å¿trong Memory: Such a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Education was beÅ¿towed upon him in his younger time, and Å¿uch powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit of God accompanied the Means of Grace enjoyed by him; that he appeared, in the Opinion of Å¿ome, remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his Religious ConverÅ¿ation, before he began to caÅ¿t off Religion.</p>
            <p>But when he had abandoned the Society
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:039607_0003_10147DC97066A000"/>
of thoÅ¿e that were viÅ¿ibly Godly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came aÅ¿Å¿ociated with Å¿ome that were openly wicked (in <hi>Providence:</hi>) He quickly grew wofully indifferent about the things of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿s, and more and more inclinable unto the ways of wickedneÅ¿s; neglecting the Publick WorÅ¿hip of God, Prophaning the Lords-Day, Å¿peaking worÅ¿e than he Å¿hould have done about Å¿ome of the Duties of ChriÅ¿tianity.</p>
            <p>Yet when he came to be MaÅ¿ter of a Family, (in <hi>Newport</hi>) he attended Family-Prayer (as he Å¿aid) above a year; but afterward that was omitted, (as he told) by reaÅ¿on of Å¿ome difference in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Whatever he did about CloÅ¿et Prayer.</p>
            <p>Having for Å¿ome time neglected the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ObÅ¿ervation of the ChriÅ¿tian Sabbath, he pretended Å¿ome concernment about the Seventh Day, but never appeared conÅ¿cientious in obÅ¿erv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that day; nor could he own, that he had renounced his Infant BaptiÅ¿m; nor had he worn off all the good impreÅ¿Å¿ions, made on his Soul, by the Means of Grace afforded to him in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> And all this while, he was generally eÅ¿teemed exemplarily exact in his Dealings, and punctual to his PromiÅ¿es, about his Worldly Affairs; He could boaÅ¿t among his Neighbours about this part of Moral HoneÅ¿ty: Tho' they could charge him too truly with Å¿peaking too largely Å¿ometimes in his Romantick DiÅ¿courÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>But he Å¿eldom or never Å¿eemed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free from Å¿ome terrible reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ConÅ¿cience, for his ApoÅ¿taÅ¿y from
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:039607_0004_10147D95711AE088"/>
God. And it hath been thought that his Convictions about Å¿ome Concerns of his Soul, mixed with Å¿ome vexations about his Affairs in the World, brought him into a grievous hurry, which by degrees boil'd up into a Å¿ort of a raging fury: And keeping out of the way of Å¿uitable directions for his Soul, his troubles of mind grew Å¿o intolerable, that he told Å¿ome, <hi>that he was weary of his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Enemies of Souls doubtleÅ¿s were not wanting in their endeavours with him, to carry all things the wrong way. For he Å¿aid, he was advis'd, <hi>To drink away his troubles; To kill his troubles of mind by drinking of Strong Drink to exeeÅ¿s</hi>: And he owned, <hi>That he had tried Å¿everal times, what this way would do; but he found by Å¿ad experience, that this was not the right way to get eaÅ¿e, for the troubles of his mind returned as the Spirits of the Drink removed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things grew Å¿o uncomfortable with him, that he loved not Home; he thought that all his Neighbours looked Å¿trangely upon him; he pretended that he feared Å¿ome body deÅ¿igned miÅ¿chief againÅ¿t him, and that he Å¿hould be Å¿lain. Every day Å¿eemed unto him as it if would be the laÅ¿t day of his life: And he asked of others, <hi>if they knew of no contrivance againÅ¿t him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Day before he committed his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he appeared mightily diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about in a very great agony, a great part of that day, chuÅ¿ing to be at the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But on the Å¿aid day of his Murders, (22 <hi>d.</hi> 1 <hi>m</hi>) he got and Å¿at upon his HouÅ¿e,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:039607_0005_10147DCB8F5A9678"/>
with a Penknife in his hand, for Å¿everal hours, if diÅ¿courÅ¿ing Å¿ometimes with thoÅ¿e that came near him, Å¿eeming afraid Å¿ome or other would hurt him; Others feared more that he would hurt himÅ¿elf; none Å¿eemed much to fear that he intended any hurt to any body elÅ¿e. And he declar'd, <hi>that he would hurt neither Man, Woman nor Child, if they would let him alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he came down from his HouÅ¿e top into his Chamber, he kept there moÅ¿t part of the Afternoon of that day, until after Sun Å¿et; and then his Wife, and her SiÅ¿ter, upon his invitation, going up to him, urging of him to go down with them, or Å¿triving with him to keep him from hurting of himÅ¿elf; it Å¿eems that then he Å¿truck his Wife in her throat with his Pen-knife; and then Å¿truck her and her SiÅ¿ter down with an Ax (that he had carried up, and he had alÅ¿o Charged his Gun; but made no uÅ¿e of that, in his Murders) how many blows he gave them, is not known: But the dreadful marks of Å¿everal remained on their miÅ¿erably man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled Bodies.</p>
            <p>When he had murdered them, he Å¿tood watchfully upon his Guard, with his Ax in hand, threatning all that offered to come up Stairs; knock'd one man down with his bloody Ax. Others endeavouring to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, by breaking up the Chamber Floor under him, &amp; the Roof over him; he laboured to defend himÅ¿elf, as if againÅ¿t the worÅ¿t Enemies. And when they carried Å¿ome Fire, flaming to light their way before them,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:039607_0006_10147D97956F1F20"/>
he Å¿natch'd away the Fire, and laid it among Å¿ome combuÅ¿tible matter, and got ready more, and quickly kindled a great Fire in the midÅ¿t of the Chamber, as if he choÅ¿e ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Burn himÅ¿elf alive, and the deal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with him than to be taken: but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chamber quickly growing too hot for him, and he being very hot with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant motion; he Å¿prung out headlong at the Window among the People, that were now Å¿urrounding of his HouÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>At Å¿ome time or other, in theÅ¿e hurries it Å¿eems, he had cut his own throat; but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that death would not come Å¿oon enough that way, and finding that he could not bear burning to death; it was thought, he was willing to try, if he could daÅ¿h himÅ¿elf to pieces, by throwing himÅ¿elf out at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; by which he alÅ¿o hurt his head, if no other part of his Body; but his Wounds were near healed, before he came to Dye.</p>
            <p>After his ApprehenÅ¿ion, he Å¿eemed for Å¿ome time too Å¿tupid and Å¿oftiÅ¿h, and willing to palliate his Murders, pretending fear that others intended to Murder him; and that he did what, he did in an hurry.</p>
            <p>And when he was carried next day to Å¿ee the Murdered Bodies, he acknowledged that it was a Å¿ad Å¿ight; but none Å¿eemed more unconcern'd at the Å¿adneÅ¿s of the Å¿ight than he, that had moÅ¿t reaÅ¿on of all to be Å¿adly concern'd at Å¿uch an amazing Spectacle.</p>
            <p>In the time of his ImpriÅ¿onment, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained too long wonderfully inÅ¿enÅ¿ible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the miÅ¿erable condition of his Soul,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:039607_0007_10147DCD2698A168"/>
yet mighty ready to reÅ¿ent provocations; whereof it muÅ¿t be confeÅ¿Å¿ed, that he had enough. Too many perÅ¿ons coming to him, and Å¿ome of them none of the beÅ¿t, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beÅ¿t deÅ¿igns, very much hindered the well improvement of his flying time, to the beÅ¿t advantage: NotwithÅ¿tanding he Å¿eemed under continual expectation that he muÅ¿t dye for his Murders; and was deÅ¿irous of the Prayers and CounÅ¿els, that he tho't might be for his benefit, and willing to Read and Hear good Books to direct and aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite his Preparation for Death; but Å¿eemed moÅ¿t of all to prize the Holy Bible; and by degrees came to a better Å¿enÅ¿e of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable CircumÅ¿tances, and frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he valued not this World, if he might be well prepared for a better; and was obÅ¿erved Å¿everal times in PriÅ¿on to warn others that came near him <hi>to Shun thoÅ¿e wayes of Sins, that he had found pernicious to himÅ¿elf</hi>; and was mightily concern'd for the Welfare of his poor Children, <hi>that they might be bro't up in the fear of God, and brought under the wings and the bonds of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> The Å¿till more hopeful tokens of a real work of Saving Grace upon his own heart would have been very deÅ¿irable; tho' he was not without repeated intreaties of Prayer, that he might be made thorowly Å¿enÅ¿ible of his WickedneÅ¿s, and prepared for Pardon thro' the Blood of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>At his Tryal, (<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>

<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:039607_0008_10147D99AF857F30"/>
was not himÅ¿elf, and Å¿o knew not what he did, when he committed them. Though he could remember the circumÅ¿tances of the Murders. And his Neighbours generally thought that he knew what he was doing, notwithÅ¿tanding his being in Å¿uch an hurry; none Å¿eemed at any loÅ¿t about his being brought in Guilty.</p>
            <p>After his Condemnation (9 <hi>D.</hi> 2 <hi>M.</hi>) he Å¿eemed more penÅ¿ive and penitent than ever before, in all the time of his ImpriÅ¿onment. ExpreÅ¿Å¿ing his deÅ¿ires to Å¿ubmit to the Will of God, praying, that God would prepare him for his Will; deÅ¿iring the prayers, and the helps of others, for Å¿uch Preparation; bewailing and lamenting his own miÅ¿erable Condition, as well as the diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es occaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by him, unto his Relations; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unto his Aged Parents, and his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children; for whom he deÅ¿ired not only the CompaÅ¿Å¿ions of Heaven, but alÅ¿o the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of his Friends upon Earth, for the good of their Souls.</p>
            <p>In the laÅ¿t night that he lived, he Å¿eemed moÅ¿t of all concerned about his Condition, mourning as if his heart were indeed ready to break; pouring out his Å¿ighs and groans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; willing to hear his attendants read in good Books, and eÅ¿pecially in the Bible. Asking their Prayers for and with him, that he might be prepar'd for his approaching End.</p>
            <p>As the time of his Execution drew near, he manifeÅ¿ted no reluctancy to attend it; only he complained, that the time between
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:039607_0009_10147DCF45965410"/>
the Sentence and his Death was very Å¿hort; ben he was told, that it was much longer than what he allowed unto thoÅ¿e whom he had murdered, and that he had lived longer by near three weeks, than he would have Å¿uffered himÅ¿elf to have lived, had he been left unto his own will.</p>
            <p>He deÅ¿ired that God would furniÅ¿h him with Courage to Glorify his Name, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Terrors of Death.</p>
            <p>As he drew near to the Place of his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he Å¿eemed mightily amazed; but Å¿o recovered, as to utter Å¿everal things, that were by Å¿ome accounted conÅ¿iderable; Å¿ome of them are preÅ¿erved.</p>
            <p>But in all the ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions that he uttered, when he came to Dy, he pretended unto no more hopes concerning the good State of his Soul, than what might be implied in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ires of an abÅ¿olute ReÅ¿ignation to the Will of God; with entire dependance on the free Grace, the Infinite Sovereign Mercy of the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>But now he is gone from among the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it becomes all the Living to hope the beÅ¿t they can concerning him, and to leave Secret Things with the Lord, to whom they belong; and to mind the revealed Will of God about their own Duty, for the good of their own Souls, and the Souls of others, whom they are yet capable of benefiting; and to make the beÅ¿t improvement they can of all Å¿uch Tragical Examples, for their own advantage; and to learn by the harms of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to keep clear from the like harms, and
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:039607_0010_10147D9BCE882F30"/>
make Å¿ure about their own Å¿eaÅ¿onable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the end of all the Living; and conÅ¿tantly remember the repeated and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Admonition of our BleÅ¿Å¿ed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in Luke 13.3, 5. <hi>SuppoÅ¿e ye, that theÅ¿e who have Å¿ufferd Å¿o Å¿ad things, are therefore greater Sinners than others. I tell you, no; but except you Repent, you Å¿hall all likewiÅ¿e pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h.</hi> And,</p>

            </p>
            <p>This poor man acknowledged in the time of his ImpriÅ¿onment, that he had forÅ¿aken God, and God had forÅ¿aken him, and then every thing Å¿eemed againÅ¿t him, and he wiÅ¿h'd, '<hi>Oh! that I had thought of any faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend, to whom I could have been willing to have gone for advice, in the time of my DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treÅ¿s.</hi> But he could own, that he lived Å¿o, that he was afraid or aÅ¿ham'd of coming into the preÅ¿ence of any Å¿uch Friend.

Spirit of God, by Sinning againÅ¿t the light of their own ConÅ¿ciences; doing of thoÅ¿e ill things, that they know Å¿hould not be done; or not doing thoÅ¿e good things, that they know Å¿hould be done: For if the Holy Spirit goes from a Soul, then comes the Evil Spirit to that Soul; and when he comes, he will be a Spirit of Slumber, as long as he can, to keep the Soul Å¿ecure in a Å¿tate, and in Å¿ome way of Sin: But when he can keep the Soul no longer Å¿ecure, but the Soul muÅ¿t, by Å¿ome means or other be awakened, to Å¿ee Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its own forlorn Condition; then he will be a Spirit of Terror, and will fill the Soul, wherein he dwells, with terrible DiÅ¿treÅ¿s, that may at length iÅ¿Å¿ue in horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deÅ¿pair.</q>
This poor man could Å¿ay, that he feared that he Å¿hould be Damned at laÅ¿t; and thought Å¿ometimes that he would Å¿trive to be as wicked as the Devil could make him; and yielded to every deÅ¿perate Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions about his own Soul, (as hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) long before his Murders.</p>

For when People begin to decline from God, and from Good, they know not where they Å¿hall Å¿top: They

            <p>TO underÅ¿tand the intention of any Text of Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is frequently advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to conÅ¿ider the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion of the Text, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with other Texts, and with the whole current of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>The OccaÅ¿ion of this Text, we may learn
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039607_0023_10147DDF930D3E38"/>
from the Title of the PÅ¿alm wherein we find it, compared with the eleventh and twelfth Chapters of the Å¿econd Book of <hi>Samuel.</hi> There we find, that <hi>David,</hi> a man after God's own Heart, was left unto very infandous, horrendous Crimes: Not only execrable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, but alÅ¿o horrid Murder, and very ungodly endeavours to conceal thoÅ¿e Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneÅ¿Å¿es; were among his Crimes. The beÅ¿t of Saints may fall into the worÅ¿t of Sins, if God leave them to themÅ¿elves. [Then what great Sins may graceleÅ¿s Sinners fall into, while under the power, and in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of Satan!] Yea, the beÅ¿t of Saints may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a long time under the guilt of their Sins, that they fall into: How long! <hi>David</hi> continued a long time under the guilt of his Crimes; it doth not appear that there was any evidence of any Repentance for his WickedneÅ¿s, for a long Å¿pace after his crimes were committed. But after a long time, the Lord Å¿ent his MiniÅ¿ter, <hi>Nathan,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to convince him of his WickedneÅ¿s, and to bring him to Repentance. It is very Å¿ure, that Sinners will never think of repentance of Sin, or turning to God, if the Lord Å¿hould not call, or look after them; Our firÅ¿t Father <hi>Adam</hi> thought not of repenting of Sin, before the Lord call'd after him; and the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Peter</hi> thought not of repenting of his Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord looked upon him. The God of all Grace in our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, with infinite CompaÅ¿Å¿ion to miÅ¿erable Sinners, calls after them, to repent and turn to him, from all their tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions, with hopes of Pardon
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039607_0024_10147DAAE9CD2818"/>
for the Å¿ake of ChriÅ¿t. Thus it is with all that live under the GoÅ¿pel: And God will certainly recover from their falls thoÅ¿e that are Saints indeed, He will not Å¿uffer them to periÅ¿h for ever in their Sins, how great and Å¿ad Å¿oever have been their falls. They Å¿hall be recovered before they dye; So was <hi>David.</hi> When the MiniÅ¿ter of God had brought him to a Å¿ight and a Å¿enÅ¿e of his WickedneÅ¿s, them <hi>David</hi> acknowledges that he had Å¿inned. He acknowledged his WickedneÅ¿s with a repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul; God helping him to repent with brokenneÅ¿s of Heart; with an heart broken for Sin, and from Sin.</p>
            <p>A PromiÅ¿e of Pardon is immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed unto the repenting Sinner: <hi>The Lord hath put away thy Sin, thou Å¿halt not dye.</hi> God is ready to bring home pardon to the truly Penitent. Sinners can't be more forward in repenting of their Sins, than God in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Souls, and making them Å¿enÅ¿ible of his pardoning mercy upon their expreÅ¿Å¿ing of their unfeigned Repentance. <hi>Thou, Lord art Good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee, that call upon thee in truth.</hi>

            <p>But after the MiniÅ¿ter of God had finiÅ¿hed his MeÅ¿Å¿age from the Lord unto <hi>David,</hi> then <hi>David</hi> compoÅ¿ed this PÅ¿alm, for the uÅ¿e of the Church of God in all After-Ages. When Å¿inful perÅ¿ons become repenting Sinners, they will be concerned for the Glory of God, and for the good of others They will be deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that God might be Glorified by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and they will be willing to do all they
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039607_0025_10147DE1B51E09A8"/>
can for the Glory of God, and they will be willing to excite others to Glorify God; and therefore to excite them to Repentance, that they may Glorify God. And they will be deÅ¿irous that their own Repentance may be as much known as ever their WickedneÅ¿s hath been known. The Sin of <hi>David,</hi> was by the wonderful Providence of God brought into open view, before the World; Å¿o that the Enemies of the Lord thereupon took occaÅ¿ion to blaÅ¿pheme the Holy Name of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> was willing that his Repentance might be openly and publickly known, that God might be thereby Glorified; that his diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour might as much as poÅ¿Å¿ible, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; that if the People of God Å¿hould be reproached, and Å¿o the Name of God be diÅ¿honoured by any wicked People, twitting of Godly People, and telling of them. <hi>Ay, Å¿ee what your</hi> David <hi>hath done, what deteÅ¿table Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he hath been guilty of, and how abominably wicked he hath been, yet he is one of your great Saints:</hi> The People of God might be able truly to reply, <hi>'Tis true, we cannot but own it with Å¿hame and with grief, that</hi> David <hi>was guilty of great Sins againÅ¿t God. But we are alÅ¿o Å¿ure, that he did truly repent of his great Sins: God gave him grace to repent, and to evidence his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance before the World, we have an excellent PÅ¿alm of his own compoÅ¿ing upon that very occaÅ¿ion, that Å¿hews that he was truly penitent.</hi> The fifty firÅ¿t PÅ¿alm is an everlaÅ¿ting teÅ¿timony to all Generations, that <hi>David</hi> was concerned to Glorify God, by evidencing of his Repentance.</p>
            <p>This will be the diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of all true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039607_0026_10147DAD9A9A4998"/>
They will be deÅ¿irous, that all their godly Neighbours may be furniÅ¿hed with Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidences of their unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for all their WickedneÅ¿s, that they may be able to do Å¿omething to Å¿top the mouths of the blaÅ¿pheming enemies of the Lord, that are glad of any occaÅ¿ions to reproach his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name.</p>
            <p>The Å¿cope of repenting <hi>David</hi> in this PÅ¿alm, is to deÅ¿ire of God that his Sins might be all pardoned, and his Adultry and his Murder, and that he might be cleanÅ¿ed from Original Pollution, and might be made Å¿enÅ¿ible of the pardon of all his Sins, and prepared to praiÅ¿e God for the forgiveneÅ¿s of his WickedneÅ¿s; and he promiÅ¿es unto the Lord, that upon his comfortable apprehenÅ¿ion of the pardon of his Å¿in, by the reÅ¿toring of the joy of the Holy Spirit unto him, he would endeavour to promote the Glory of God, by furthering the ConverÅ¿ion of other Sinners. And he Å¿hews an earneÅ¿t deÅ¿ire for the ProÅ¿perity of the People of God: He knew that he had exceedingly grieved them by his MiÅ¿carriages, and he was concerned that they might Å¿hare with him in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olations upon his Reconciliation with God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
               <hi>Penitent Sinners that have grieved others by their Sins, will be deÅ¿irous that others may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion to rejoyce in their Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our Context, we find the penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner declaring what would not Å¿atisfy God for his offences. None of the Sacrifices ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God in the Ceremonial Law, to be offered by his People, in their External

WorÅ¿hip, could Å¿atisfy for the wrongs that were done by Sin to the MajeÅ¿ty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The Wrath of God could not be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by them, nor could they remove the guilt of Å¿in from the Soul of the Sinner. <hi>The blood of Bulls and of Goats could never take away Sins.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> fully underÅ¿tood, and he plainly declares to the World his firm belief, that none of the Levitical Sacrifices could make full Å¿atisfaction to Divine JuÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice for the Å¿ins of any perÅ¿on but they had a reÅ¿pect unto Å¿ome other thing. Then he declares what Sacrifices would be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God. <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit.</hi> May not this principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, who being made a Sacrifice unto the Divine JuÅ¿tice, had his Spirit grievouÅ¿ly broken by the wrath of God, while he was offering up himÅ¿elf a Sacrifice for the Sins of his People? He could Å¿ay before he came to dye, <hi>My Soul is exceeding Å¿orrowful, even unto death</hi>; and when he came to dye, <hi>he poured out his Soul unto death.</hi> His very Soul within him was dreadfully broken by the Anger of GOD, which he endured for the Å¿ake of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they might be delivered from the Wrath to come. And altho' he were the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally beloved Son of God, yet appearing as the Surety for Sinners, the Wrath of God broke his very Spirit within him. And becauÅ¿e he was the Eternally Beloved Son of God, therefore he was the Sacrifice of God; a Sacrifice accepted with God, as well as appointed by God; Yea; he was
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039607_0028_10147DB00CF283A0"/>
himÅ¿elf God, truly and really God. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry PerÅ¿on that was offered a Sacrifice for Sin, was God Tho' he Å¿uffered only as Man, the Divine Nature being uncapable of Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, yet the PerÅ¿on that Å¿uffered was truly <hi>God over all bleÅ¿Å¿ed for ever:</hi> And Å¿o the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Å¿uch an One, was of infinite value &amp; virtue, and for that reaÅ¿on might be Å¿tyled, <hi>The Sacrifices of God.</hi> For, beÅ¿ure the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t was of more value infinitely than all the other Sacrifices that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to be offered; He was the Antytipe of them all, and as good as ten hundred thouÅ¿and millions of Å¿uch Sacrifices. Yea, infinitely better than all other Sacrifices. Thus being as good as all, better than all, he might be called <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> And he was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Å¿uch value as to Å¿atisfy for the Å¿ins of all that will accept of him for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, let them be never Å¿o many Souls; &amp; he is a Sacrifice of Å¿uch value, as to Å¿atisfy for all their Sins, if they believe on him, let their Sins be never Å¿o many; Å¿o may the Son of God be Å¿tyled, the <hi>Sacrifices of God. He is the Propitiation for the Å¿ins of the whole World, both Jews and Gentiles, that believe in him as their Saviour</hi>; He is a Sacrifice for them all, for all their Å¿ins. Yea, Å¿uch is the Å¿ufficiency of the Merit of the Sacrifice of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t, that if all the Sinners in the world would believe on him, there is merit enough in his Blood to Å¿atisfy for all their Å¿ins: Of Å¿uch value is his Blood, and therefore might he be called the <hi>Sacrifices of God.</hi> His Spirit having been broken, he is the <hi>Sacrifices of

God.</hi> Thro' him other things may be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God. For it follows in our Text, <hi>A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deÅ¿piÅ¿e</hi>Â· If the heart of a Sinner be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Sin, and from Sin, God will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piÅ¿e that heart, but he will for the Å¿ake of the <hi>Sacrifices of God,</hi> Å¿hew favour to one that hath Å¿uch an heart. For there is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended than is expreÅ¿Å¿ed in the words. <hi>God will not deÅ¿piÅ¿e a broken heart,</hi> that is; <hi>He will greatly delight in Å¿uch an heart, Å¿uch an heart will be acceptable with him.</hi> Tho' Sinners do not deÅ¿erve the favour of God by their broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of heart, yet their brokenneÅ¿s of heart doth prepare Sinners for the favour of God; and he will certainly Å¿hew his favour to them, who have their hearts rightly broken with Evangelical Contrition.</p>

               <p>To this we may anÅ¿wer; Six things muÅ¿t be attended, and a Å¿eventh muÅ¿t not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Penitent Sinner, that would have a broken Heart acceptable with the Glorious God thro' JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There muÅ¿t be Å¿ome</hi> ILLUMINATION <hi>of the Mind, where there is that brokenneÅ¿s of Heart that will be acceptable with God through ChriÅ¿t.</hi> The UnderÅ¿tanding muÅ¿t be enlightened if the heart be rightly broken.

by aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing expectations of the Wrath of GOD, juÅ¿t ready to be poured down upon the Soul; yet if there be no light in the mind, the heart is not rightly broken; If the mind be full of darkneÅ¿s, there may be Å¿ome Å¿ort of brokenneÅ¿s of heart, but not that which will be acceptable with God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muÅ¿t there be Å¿ome illumination of the UnderÅ¿tanding, to Å¿ee Å¿omething about thoÅ¿e Truths of God, that will Å¿hew why the heart of a Sinner Å¿hould be broken. The broken hearted Sinner will have Å¿ome underÅ¿tanding and conÅ¿ideration about the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s and the holineÅ¿s of God, about the odiouÅ¿neÅ¿s and heinouÅ¿neÅ¿s of Å¿in, about the juÅ¿tice and the Å¿trictneÅ¿s of the Law of God, that is broken by Å¿in; about the certainty of the threatnings of the Law of God againÅ¿t Å¿in, about the dreadfulneÅ¿s of the puniÅ¿hment threatned for Å¿in, by the Law, and about the unavoidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the puniÅ¿hment threatned, without full Å¿atisfaction to the Law, which cannot be without a perfect righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s every way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wering the Law; but no Å¿uch righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s can he had beÅ¿ides the RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t; nor can this RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s be had without faith in ChriÅ¿t; and where there is true Å¿aving faith in ChriÅ¿t, there muÅ¿t and will be unfeigned repentance that breaks the heart for, and from Å¿in Such as theÅ¿e things muÅ¿t have Å¿ome conÅ¿ideration in the Penitent Sinner, that will have his heart Å¿o broken, as to be accepted with God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muÅ¿t there be not only Å¿ome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Law of God, but alÅ¿o Å¿ome

If the heart of the Sinner be duly broken, then will the Repenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be able truly to Å¿ay, <hi>Now I Å¿ee Å¿omething of the RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of the Holy God, and I muÅ¿t acknowledge the holineÅ¿s of his righteous Law; his Law is holy, juÅ¿t and good, therefore Sin which breaks that Law, muÅ¿t be an evil and a bitter thing.</hi>

               <p>Examine then upon this Article as we paÅ¿s along, and conÅ¿ider, every Soul. Is your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding Å¿o enlightned as to Å¿ee the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouÅ¿neÅ¿s and the holineÅ¿s of God; to Å¿ee the odiouÅ¿neÅ¿s and the heinouÅ¿neÅ¿s of Sin; to Å¿ee the juÅ¿tice and the Å¿trictneÅ¿s of the Law of God; to Å¿ee the certainty of the threatnings of the Law, to Å¿ee the dreadfulneÅ¿s of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hment threatned by the Law upon the breakers of the Law; to Å¿ee the inevitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s

of the threatned puniÅ¿hment, without a full Å¿atisfaction to the Law, which cannot be without a perfect RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, every way anÅ¿wering the Law; and that there is no Å¿uch RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s to be had, beÅ¿ides the RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t, and this cannot be had without faith in him; and this faith muÅ¿t be attended with unfeigned Repentance, to which belongs brokenneÅ¿s of heart for, and from Sin? Do you Å¿ee Å¿omething about the reality of theÅ¿e things? If you Å¿ee nothing about them, it is not likely that your hearts will be rightly broken: But if your minds are enlightned Å¿o as to Å¿ee, and conÅ¿ider and realize theÅ¿e and Å¿uch things, there is room to hope that Å¿omething is doing toward breaking of your hearts with a GoÅ¿pel Contrition.</p>
               <p>But then,</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>There muÅ¿t be Å¿ome</hi> CONVICTION <hi>upon the ConÅ¿cience, where there is that brokenneÅ¿s of heart that will be acceptable with God through ChriÅ¿t.</hi> This Conviction doth conÅ¿iÅ¿t in a perÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal &amp; particular application of guilt &amp; wrath unto the Sinners own Soul, Å¿o as to bring the Sinner to an acknowledgment like this; <hi>If the Word of God be true, then my Soul is in a miÅ¿erable Condition.</hi> For as long as notions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the head as airy, empty Å¿peculations, without coming down into the heart, with a powerful impreÅ¿Å¿ion upon the Soul, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners never have their hearts duly broken; let their notions be never Å¿o good and right. The RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of God, and his HolineÅ¿s,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039607_0034_10147DB6620770E8"/>
the juÅ¿tice and Å¿trictneÅ¿s of his Law may be acknowledged, Å¿in may be conÅ¿idered as an evil and hateful thing; but the Sinner will not be affected with the evilneÅ¿s and the hatefulneÅ¿s of Å¿in, without Å¿ome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction upon the ConÅ¿cience, whereby a Å¿enÅ¿e of the evil of Å¿in is brought nigh unto the Soul, and the weight of Å¿in is laid upon the Soul. For as the heavieÅ¿t weights while at a diÅ¿tance, will not bruiÅ¿e nor break, but when they are laid upon us, then they may bruiÅ¿e and break us: Thus while Sinners conÅ¿ider of the evil in Å¿in at a diÅ¿tance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any application of the guilt of Sin to their own Souls, in their conÅ¿iderations, they will not have their Å¿inful heart rightly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Therefore is there a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of that thing, in <hi>John</hi> 16.8. <hi>The Spirit convincing of Å¿in.</hi> There muÅ¿t be a work of the Holy Spirit of God, bringing home conviction upon the Soul of the Sinner, Å¿o as to lay Å¿omething of the weight of guilt upon the Soul, in order to a right brokenneÅ¿s of heart. The Sinner muÅ¿t come to acknowledge, <hi>I know Sin to be in it Å¿elf an evil thing, becauÅ¿e it is a tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion of the juÅ¿t law of a Good God, and I feel my Å¿elf guilty of Å¿uch evil before the Lord; I have tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed the Law of God, the guilt of Sin lies upon my Soul; and I am Å¿enÅ¿ible of Å¿omething of the burthen of Å¿in.</hi> So it muÅ¿t be with the Sinner, that his heart may be rightly broken. <hi>David</hi> might be produced as an inÅ¿tance of this. He might hear abundance of Sermons Preached about Repentance, while he was under the guilt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039607_0035_10147DF34BAD1ED8"/>
of Å¿in, but none of them Å¿eemed to break his heart, until the Holy Spirit of God, by a particular application of the Truth of God in the MiniÅ¿try of the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> Å¿aid, <hi>You</hi> David <hi>are the man that is guilty of all the WickedneÅ¿s that you have condemned; for you have done Å¿o and Å¿o, and have broken the Laws of God, and have deÅ¿erved the Wrath and CurÅ¿e of God, the guilt of Sin lies upon your Soul.</hi> This particular application, by the Holy Spirit of God, in the MiniÅ¿try of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet began to make Å¿ome tendency toward the breaking of the heart of Å¿inful <hi>David.</hi> And Å¿o, when the Spirit of God will pleaÅ¿e to Å¿et home Conviction upon the ConÅ¿cience of the guilty Sinner, and bring him to Å¿ee and own that he hath been guilty of thoÅ¿e things for which the Wrath of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the Law of God, againÅ¿t the Children of DiÅ¿obedience, who break that Law; then may there be Å¿ome room to hope that the heart will be rightly broken.</p>
               <p>Examine then upon this Article, and conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, every Soul; <hi>Have you not only had your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding Illuminated about the truth of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring unto the Evil of Sin, Å¿o as to Å¿ee, that Sin in it Å¿elf is an evil thing and a bitter; but have you alÅ¿o had Å¿uch a Conviction upon your ConÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that you do feel the burden of Sin? Do you feel the dreadful weight of the guilt of Å¿in upon your Soul? Is your Soul burthened with the guilt of Å¿in?</hi> If there be no Å¿uch Conviction upon the ConÅ¿cience, it is no wonder if there be no brokenneÅ¿s of heart. But if there be Å¿uch Conviction upon the ConÅ¿cience, then is there
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039607_0036_10147DB7F89778F8"/>
Å¿omething done toward breaking of the heart. But there muÅ¿t be Å¿till Å¿omething more done, before the heart will be rightly broken, Å¿o as to be acceptable with God. For,</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>There muÅ¿t be a diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ing</hi> AFFLICTION <hi>of Soul, attending of this Conviction upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, where there is the brokenneÅ¿s of heart, that will be acceptable with God through JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi> The Soul muÅ¿t be made Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible of the burden of Sin, as to be affected, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouÅ¿ly <hi>afflicted</hi> with that dreadful burden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heart is duly broken. PerÅ¿ons may acknowledge that Sin is Evil, and they may be Å¿enÅ¿ible, that Å¿in hath done much evil to them, and that it deÅ¿erves the Wrath and CurÅ¿e of God for ever; and they may be convinced, that they are guilty of Å¿in, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of guilt lies upon their Souls; and yet they may not be very much afflicted in their Souls, becauÅ¿e of their Å¿ins: their Å¿ins may Å¿eem Å¿omewhat burthenÅ¿ome, yet they are but light burdens to them, or tolerable; they can Å¿till bear the burden of their Å¿ins; the burden of Å¿in is not altogether inÅ¿uppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, at leaÅ¿t they think that they are able to endure it a little longer. The hearts of theÅ¿e Sinners be not duly broken. For if the heart be rightly broken for Å¿in, the Soul muÅ¿t be diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed and afflicted, becauÅ¿e of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Å¿in, Å¿o as to be able to Å¿ay like him, in PÅ¿al. 40.12. <hi>Innumerable evils have compaÅ¿Å¿ed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, Å¿o that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head, therefore my heart

faileth me:</hi> Or like him, in PÅ¿al. 38.4. <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my head as an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, too heavy for me to bear.</hi> When Sinners come to this, then is there Å¿ome room to hope that their Å¿inful hearts will be rightly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but as long as they can bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of their Å¿ins beÅ¿ure they have not that brokenneÅ¿s of heart that will be acceptable with God; for <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> If the heart be rightly broken, it cannot eaÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear up under the burden of Å¿in: The burden of Å¿in will Å¿ink the broken heart Å¿o as to make it long for deliverance from that burden. Sinners may know and own, that DrunkenneÅ¿s, UncleanneÅ¿s, Lying, Stealing, prophane Swearing and CurÅ¿ing, and BlaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the Name of God, Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, DiÅ¿obedience to Superiours, and Malice, Envy, DiÅ¿content, as well as Murder and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heinous Crimes, are great Å¿ins before God; but as long as they do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themÅ¿elves guilty of any of theÅ¿e Crimes, their hearts will not be broken, how guilty Å¿oever they are of theÅ¿e Crimes. Yea, Sinners may know and own themÅ¿elves to be guilty of theÅ¿e and thoÅ¿e crimes; ConÅ¿cience may tell one perÅ¿on, <hi>You are a Drunkard</hi>; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perÅ¿on, <hi>You walk in Å¿ome way of UncleanneÅ¿s?</hi> another perÅ¿on, <hi>You are guilty of Lying or Stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or prophane Swearing, CurÅ¿ing</hi>; another perÅ¿on, <hi>You are a Sabbath-breaker, diÅ¿obedient to Superiours, guilty of Malice, Envy, DÅ¿icontent, or Å¿ome other WickedneÅ¿s.</hi> But if Sinners can bear theÅ¿e and Å¿uch intimations of ConÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto them, without feeling any Å¿uch

heavy burden, but what they can bear up their Spirits under it, their hearts be not rightly broken. Sinners may be convinced, without being converted. This is plain. The Hearers of the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Peter,</hi> when they were told of their WickedneÅ¿s in Crucifying the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, <hi>They were pricked to their hearts</hi>; their hearts began to be rightly broken. But the Hearers of the Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> while they were told of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneÅ¿s in reÅ¿iÅ¿ting the Holy Spirit, they were <hi>cut to the heart.</hi> Their hearts were after a manner bruiÅ¿ed, and pierced, and vexed, but not rightly broken. They went on Å¿till in WickedneÅ¿s. Thence it appears that Sinners may have Å¿ome Å¿enÅ¿e of Å¿in, without having their hearts rightly broken for, and from Å¿in. There may be Å¿ome knowledge, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the evil that is in Å¿in, as well as of the evil that comes by Å¿in, without any right brokenneÅ¿s of heart: But where there is a right brokenneÅ¿s of heart, there will be affliction of Soul, becauÅ¿e of the burden of Å¿in: ConÅ¿cience muÅ¿t not only be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but muÅ¿t alÅ¿o be quickned and excited to do its duty toward the convinced Sinner; to make the Sinner conÅ¿ider with trembling, <hi>I have provoked the righteous and holy God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed my Å¿elf unto his terrible diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure: What Å¿hall I do to eÅ¿cape the Wrath of God?</hi> ConÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reveals the Wrath of God unto the Sinner, when the heart is rightly broken, Å¿o as to make the Soul of the Sinner full of diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treÅ¿s and anguiÅ¿h, and to have Å¿ecret wiÅ¿hes like theÅ¿e: <hi>Oh, that I had never been! Oh, that

Oh, that I might eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Vengeance of Eternal Fire, that is due to me for Sin! How can I dwell with Devouring Fire! How Å¿hall I dwell with EverlaÅ¿ting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? What Å¿hall I do to be Saved?</hi> Such O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Spirit of God working by ConÅ¿cience, are in the Souls of the Sinners that have their Å¿inful hearts rightly broken for Å¿in. There muÅ¿t be Å¿ome work of the Law upon the Soul, to bring the Sinner into diÅ¿treÅ¿s by reaÅ¿on of Å¿in. The Law of God, or the Spirit of God by the Law, muÅ¿t rouÅ¿e up the Sinner, to Å¿mite him and laÅ¿h him for Å¿in, before there will be that brokenneÅ¿s of heart, that will be acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>Indeed, there will not be the like degrees of diÅ¿treÅ¿s in the Souls of all Sinners, that have their hearts duly broken for Sin.</p>
               <p>Some Sinners may have greater terrours, and of longer continuance than others.</p>
               <p>God may work more gradually with Å¿ome than with others; for the holy Spirit of God is an arbitrary Agent: He may act how he pleaÅ¿es, and where and when he pleaÅ¿es. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liÅ¿teth,</hi> and Å¿o the Spirit of God may work as he pleaÅ¿eth. And Å¿o Å¿ome Å¿ecure Sinners may be awakened out of their Å¿inful Security, as with a Å¿trong Wind, or a loud Voice, or as with dreadful Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that may Å¿eem at once to break their Å¿inful Hearts all to Å¿hivers. They may like the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul</hi> in his conviction, be Å¿truck down by the mighty power of God, or like

the convinced Jaylor, be Å¿truck with dreadful Fear, what will become of their Souls for ever. And Å¿ome of theÅ¿e may be Å¿peedily raiÅ¿ed up and revived and comforted and Å¿trengthned, and have their Eyes opened quickly, and their Souls refreÅ¿hed and filled with abundance of Å¿weet ConÅ¿olations from God. Others may lye longer under bitter diÅ¿treÅ¿s of Soul. The terrours of God may abide upon them and Å¿eem to drink up their Spirits. They may go mourning under the burden of their Sins a long time, and may walk in heavineÅ¿s of Soul, until they cry out, <hi>Will the Lord caÅ¿t off for ever, will he be favourable no more?</hi> God may for holy ReaÅ¿ons, keep them long under trouble of Soul. Sometimes to make them own that his Grace is free, or to make them cry the more fervently for his Grace, or to make them prize comfort the more, and to be the more thankful for it, when it is beÅ¿towed, or to prepare them for the greater ConÅ¿olations. Other Å¿ecure Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be awakened out of their Å¿inful Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, as with a Å¿mall Wind, or a Å¿till Voice, or as with pleaÅ¿ant WhiÅ¿pers, that Å¿eem to delight their Souls: The Lord may Å¿ecretly open their Hearts to receive his Grace, and as when <hi>Samuel</hi> was to be Å¿et about the work of God, the Lord call'd him in Å¿uch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that there Å¿eemed no greater concernment or amazement than what had been uÅ¿ual up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Spirit: So may Å¿ome Sinners be brought home to God with leÅ¿s preÅ¿Å¿ure from the burden of their Sins than Å¿ome other Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And of theÅ¿e there may be Å¿ome that

have comfort quickly beÅ¿towed upon them, in the light of Gods countenance lifted up over their Souls. They may lye but a Å¿hort time under their diÅ¿treÅ¿s of Soul by reaÅ¿on of the burden of their Sins. Others may have their diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es abiding longer upon them. They may continue a great while under the work of the Spirit, as a Spirit of bondage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they find him working as a Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption upon their Souls. But Å¿till we muÅ¿t beÅ¿ure that all Sinners that have their Hearts broken Å¿o as to be accepted with God, feel Sin to be a grievous burthen to their Souls. They are made willing to get rid of that burden. They cann't bear to think of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the burden of Sin. The burden of Sin is of all burdens the moÅ¿t intollerable. And if they underÅ¿tand that they muÅ¿t wait upon God in the uÅ¿e of the means of Grace for the influences of his holy Spirit, to draw them to the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; They will pray in Å¿ecret and with others, and deÅ¿ire others to pray for them, and if they can, with them; They will, (if they can) read the Word of God, and hear his Word, and beg of God, to Å¿et home his truths upon their Souls, that their Souls may be Å¿till more burthened with Sin, that they may Å¿till be more Å¿enÅ¿ible of their burthen, Å¿o as to be made really willing to part with Sin. They will pray that God would for the Å¿ake of ChriÅ¿t by his holy Spirit, apply the pardoning, Å¿oftning, healing Blood of ChriÅ¿t unto their Souls, and unite their Souls to ChriÅ¿t by a living Faith, and make an

               <p>Examine then upon this Article and conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, every Soul; <hi>Are you Å¿o burthened with Sin, Å¿o Afflicted for Sin, that you are willing to be Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated eternally from all Sin?

But if there be a willingneÅ¿s to be Å¿eparated from all Sin for ever; and a gladneÅ¿s that God will uÅ¿e any means to Å¿eparate from Sin, then is there Å¿ome room to hope that the Heart begins to be broken. Affliction of Soul by reaÅ¿on of the burden of Sin, will drive the repenting Sinner to Supplication before the Lord for deliverance from Sin with hopes of Pardon for the Å¿ake of ChriÅ¿t, if the Heart ever be Å¿o broken as to be accepted with the Lord: But theÅ¿e things muÅ¿t be accompany'd with another thing: For</p>

An humble Heart is a broken Heart. The broken hearted Sinner may acknowledge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, in Lam. 3.19. <hi>Remembring my Affliction and my MiÅ¿ery, the Wormwood and the Gall, my Soul hath them Å¿till in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</hi> Then a broken Heart muÅ¿t be an humbled Heart.

The heart of ChriÅ¿t was broken, that his Blood might be applied to believing Sinners, for the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of their Å¿ins, and the Å¿alvation of their Souls, TheÅ¿e things muÅ¿t be conÅ¿idered by Sinners; and they muÅ¿t have, a realizing apprehenÅ¿ion about the readineÅ¿s and willingneÅ¿s of the Glorious God to receive broken-hearted Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners into his favour for the Å¿ake of ChriÅ¿t. <hi>If God Å¿pared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how Å¿hall he not with him freely give us all things.</hi> If God hath broken the heart of his Son for us, will he not heal our hearts, upon our Å¿eeking to him? Thus we muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider that our hearts may be rightly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Our eyes muÅ¿t be unto the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, for all the bleÅ¿Å¿ings and benefits of broken hearts; if we will be accepted with God. We muÅ¿t look unto ChriÅ¿t for all the good that is beÅ¿towed in, and with a broken heart. By the merit of his heart blood, muÅ¿t our hearts be broken for, and from our Å¿ins, and healed when Å¿o broken; and the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039607_0051_10147E0607B94F68"/>
of our brokenneÅ¿s of heart with God, muÅ¿t be aÅ¿cribed unto him, whoÅ¿e heart was fore broken: For we may not expect to be accepted with God, meerly becauÅ¿e our Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful herrts are broken, Å¿o as to be willing to he delivered and Å¿eparated from Å¿in: For if we have no intereÅ¿t in the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, we cannot by any means be admitted into the favour of God, nor accepted in his right, tho' our hearts were never Å¿o much broken; for we muÅ¿t conÅ¿tantly remember that, in 1 Pet 2.5. <hi>Spiritual Sacrifice acceptable to God, by JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi> When we try to offer broken hearts for Å¿acrifices unto God, we muÅ¿t look for acceptance of them thro' JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. And when ever we deÅ¿ire the mercy of a broken heart, or the mercies promiÅ¿ed with Å¿uch an heart, we muÅ¿t behold our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t purchaÅ¿ing all for us; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God the Father is willing, for the Å¿ake of his Son, by his Holy Spirit, to beÅ¿tow upon us all the good things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a broken heart, if we are but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive thoÅ¿e good things; and if we are made thus willing, we are obliged unto a broken-hearted Redeemer for that willingneÅ¿s. He hath purchaÅ¿ed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that willingneÅ¿s for us, and beÅ¿towed it on us. Thus muÅ¿t there be an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henÅ¿ion of the pardoning mercy of God in ChriÅ¿t, where there is the brokenneÅ¿s of heart that God will accept.</p>
               <p>Hereupon Examine then every Soul, and conÅ¿ider, <hi>Have you a due regard unto the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, in all your Å¿orrow for Sin? Do you look

for acceptance of your Å¿erious endeavours about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance on the account of the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t! Or do you think to deÅ¿erve or obtain the Mercies of God, by your brokenneÅ¿s of Heart? Or do you think to prepare your Å¿elves for Union with ChriÅ¿t, by getting your Hearts more broken by your endeavours in your own Å¿trength?</hi> Certainly if you have had no regard unto JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in your eÅ¿Å¿ays to get your Hearts broken, or if you have not eyed him, as the author and finiÅ¿her of this benefit, you have yet no right brokenneÅ¿s of Heart. If the blood of ChriÅ¿t hath not been applyed unto your Souls, by the holy Spirit of God bringing home the Å¿enÅ¿e of Gods love in JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t to your Souls, and helping you to believe in ChriÅ¿t, you cannot be Å¿ure that your Hearts have been rightly broken. But if our underÅ¿tandings have been Å¿o illuminated as to Å¿ee the juÅ¿tice and Å¿trictneÅ¿s of the holy law of the righteous God, and the odiouÅ¿neÅ¿t and the heinouÅ¿neÅ¿s of all Å¿in againÅ¿t that Law, and the dreadfulneÅ¿s, and the certainty of the puniÅ¿hment threatned by that Law, againÅ¿t all the breakers of that Law, without a full Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to that law by a perfect RighteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s; and if we have Å¿uch conviction upon our ConÅ¿ciences, that the burden of Sin lies heavily upon our Souls, and our Souls are Å¿o diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed and afflicted with that burden, that we are Å¿o humbled, grieved and aÅ¿hamed, that we have Å¿inned, and willing to Å¿ubmit unto any terms, that God Å¿hall preÅ¿cribe, that we may be delivered from Sin; and if we abhor all Sin, reÅ¿olve and purpoÅ¿e againÅ¿t it with all our Hearts, relying on ChriÅ¿t
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039607_0053_10147E08CF905830"/>
for Å¿trength to avoid and conquer all Sin; and if we have a continual apprehenÅ¿ion of the pardoning mercy of God, in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t, with faith in his Blood, and are continually concerned for aÅ¿Å¿urance of an IntereÅ¿t in that Mercy, on the account of ChriÅ¿t; and our Souls do more and more long for more full aÅ¿Å¿urance of our Union and Communion with ChriÅ¿t, and our Souls are more and more Å¿wallowed up in love unto the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and in Admiration of his Love to our Souls; and we aÅ¿cribe unto him the Glory of all the good that ever we enjoyed, or deÅ¿ire to enjoy; and are continually Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying and contriving to Å¿hew our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s unto God for giving ChriÅ¿t unto us; and our thankfulneÅ¿s unto ChriÅ¿t, for what he hath been willing to do and bear for our good, and if we long for Heaven, becauÅ¿e there we Å¿hall be employed in glorifying of the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t for ever; Then we have Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the brokenneÅ¿s of Heart, that will appear acceptable with the glorious God thro' JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</p>

                  <hi>AnÅ¿w</hi> 1. Sin is pardoned and the Soul Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued unto God when the Heart is thus broken. Therefore is this brokenneÅ¿s of Heart accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God. We read in IÅ¿aiah 1.18. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them that are willing and obedient, Å¿o have their Hearts broken, <hi>Tho' their Sins be as Scarlet, they Å¿hall be white as Snow; tho' they
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039607_0054_10147E2F421946F8"/>
be red as CrimÅ¿on, they Å¿hall be as Wool.</hi> The meaning is, they Å¿hall be all Pardoned, and the Souls of the Sinners purifyed, as well as juÅ¿tifyed. Then the clamour of their Sins, will be Silenced, and they Å¿hall not hinder the courÅ¿e of the Mercies of God, unto their Souls. We find in IÅ¿a. 59.2. It is declared to Å¿ome, <hi>Your Iniquities have Å¿eparated between you and your God, your Sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear.</hi> But if their Sins are pardoned, then Sinners may have acceÅ¿s to God thro' JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: And when the wall of Å¿eparation is made by Sin, between God and our Souls is removed, then will there be a free paÅ¿Å¿age for mercy to our Souls. Then will God manifeÅ¿t unto our Souls, that he doth receive us into his favour and Å¿o our broken Hearts will appear not to be deÅ¿piÅ¿ed, but accepted with the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God is appeaÅ¿ed unto Sinners, and well pleaÅ¿ed with them for the Å¿ake of ChriÅ¿t, when their Hearts be Å¿o broken.</hi> Their wills are brought into Gods will in brokenneÅ¿s of Heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will he not deÅ¿piÅ¿e their broken Hearts, being reconciled unto their perÅ¿ons. The great conteÅ¿t between God and Sinners, it is this, <hi>Who Å¿hall have their Will,</hi> God or Sinners? But when the Hearts of Sinners are duly broken, then they yield to God. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent that he Å¿hould have his will. He hath attained his end upon them, and brought them to a Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to his pleaÅ¿ure, and Å¿o he is attoned to them; Thence will God have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in broken Hearts, and make his abode in them, as in IÅ¿a. 57.5. <hi>The high and lofty
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:039607_0055_10147E0B33834950"/>
one that Inhabiteth Eternity, dwelleth with him that is of a contrite and humble Spirit,</hi> and he will revive &amp; comfort them that are Å¿o. And he Å¿ays in IÅ¿a. 66. <hi>To this man will I look, that is of a contrite Spirit, and that trembleth at my Word.</hi> When the Heart of <hi>Ephraim</hi> was broken Å¿o as to bewail and bemoan his miÅ¿erable condition, then Å¿ays the Lord in Jer. 31.20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son, I do earneÅ¿tly remember him Å¿till, my bowels are troubled for him, I will Å¿urely have mercy on him, Å¿aith the Lord.</hi> God being reconciled unto Sinners, will Å¿urely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their broken Hearts, and be well pleaÅ¿ed with them</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The heart of God appears in a manner broken with compaÅ¿Å¿ion toward MiÅ¿erable Sinners, when their Å¿inful hearts do appear to be duly broken.</hi> But if His Heart be broken and opened with compaÅ¿Å¿ion toward Sinners, then be Å¿ure, he will not deÅ¿piÅ¿e their brokenneÅ¿s of Heart. We read in Judges 10.16. The People of God had grievouÅ¿ly Å¿inned againÅ¿t the Lord, MiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries came upon them for their Sins, they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Lord for deliverance from their miÅ¿eries, the Lord brought them to Å¿uch a brokenneÅ¿s of heart that they complyed with his will, Then it follows, <hi>The Soul of the Lord was grieved for the MiÅ¿ery of IÅ¿rael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theÅ¿e things we may learn a little what means that brokenneÅ¿s of Heart which God will not deÅ¿piÅ¿e, and <hi>That</hi> and <hi>Why</hi> Å¿uch bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneÅ¿s of Heart will be acceptable with God thro' JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>USE 1. We might hence Learn, <hi>The
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:039607_0056_10147E326074BB28"/>
folly of all Sinners that harden their heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t God, that will not comply with his Will.</hi> They Å¿hall not, they cannot proÅ¿per; for none ever yet proÅ¿pered in hardening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves againÅ¿t God. God evermore, overcomes all thoÅ¿e that harden themÅ¿elves againÅ¿t him. Remember <hi>Pharoah</hi>! If the Hearts of Sinners be not broken by the means of Grace in the time of his patience, they will certainly be dreadfully broken by the Wrath of God in the day of Vengeance. Would Sinners conÅ¿ent to have their Hearts broken by the means that God hath appointed for the breaking of them, they would find that the Lord would take pleaÅ¿ure in them; He delights in broken Hearts, but as long as poor Sinners do refuÅ¿e to have their Hearts broken, they find their bands are made Å¿tronger and Å¿tronger: The diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es of their Soul grow more and more terrible. Was it not Å¿o with <hi>David,</hi> in PÅ¿al. 32.3. Where he Å¿ays <hi>While I kept Å¿ilent</hi> (from confeÅ¿Å¿ing of Sin to God:) <hi>my bones waxed old thro' my roaring all the day.</hi> But when his Heart was broken Å¿o, as to be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿s his Sin to God; Then he found relief in, releaÅ¿e from his trouble of Soul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Å¿hould Sinners be willing to have their Hearts broken Å¿o as to be prepared for the Å¿enÅ¿e of the pardoning mercy of God in ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us. For obÅ¿tinacy and obduracy in Sin will never be comfortable to Sinners. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence we may learn, what we muÅ¿t do, that we may find acceptance with God thro' ChriÅ¿t.</hi> We muÅ¿t muÅ¿t get our underÅ¿tandings illuminated in the truths of God, our ConÅ¿ciences convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

We muÅ¿t not imagine to get our Hearts broken that we may come to ChriÅ¿t, but we muÅ¿t come to ChriÅ¿t for brokenneÅ¿s of Heart: We muÅ¿t look on him whoÅ¿e Heart hath been pierced and broken by our Sins, that our Heart may be broken for our Sins, and from our Sins.
