            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Narrative OF Jeremiah Meacham.</head>
            <p>THE Man that occaſioned the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Enſuing Sermon, was Born at, or near <hi>Salem,</hi> and Lived there, and in ſeveral other places of <hi>Boſton</hi> Province near half his Dayes, before he came into <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, where he Married and continued, until he was more than Forty Years Old.</p>
            <p>Furniſhed with a good Natural Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and a ſtrong Memory: Such a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Education was beſtowed upon him in his younger time, and ſuch powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit of God accompanied the Means of Grace enjoyed by him; that he appeared, in the Opinion of ſome, remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his Religious Converſation, before he began to caſt off Religion.</p>
            <p>But when he had abandoned the Society
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:039607_0003_10147DC97066A000"/>
of thoſe that were viſibly Godly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came aſſociated with ſome that were openly wicked (in <hi>Providence:</hi>) He quickly grew wofully indifferent about the things of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and more and more inclinable unto the ways of wickedneſs; neglecting the Publick Worſhip of God, Prophaning the Lords-Day, ſpeaking worſe than he ſhould have done about ſome of the Duties of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Yet when he came to be Maſter of a Family, (in <hi>Newport</hi>) he attended Family-Prayer (as he ſaid) above a year; but afterward that was omitted, (as he told) by reaſon of ſome difference in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Whatever he did about Cloſet Prayer.</p>
            <p>Having for ſome time neglected the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Obſervation of the Chriſtian Sabbath, he pretended ſome concernment about the Seventh Day, but never appeared conſcientious in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that day; nor could he own, that he had renounced his Infant Baptiſm; nor had he worn off all the good impreſſions, made on his Soul, by the Means of Grace afforded to him in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> And all this while, he was generally eſteemed exemplarily exact in his Dealings, and punctual to his Promiſes, about his Worldly Affairs; He could boaſt among his Neighbours about this part of Moral Honeſty: Tho' they could charge him too truly with ſpeaking too largely ſometimes in his Romantick Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>But he ſeldom or never ſeemed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free from ſome terrible reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Conſcience, for his Apoſtaſy from
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:039607_0004_10147D95711AE088"/>
God. And it hath been thought that his Convictions about ſome Concerns of his Soul, mixed with ſome vexations about his Affairs in the World, brought him into a grievous hurry, which by degrees boil'd up into a ſort of a raging fury: And keeping out of the way of ſuitable directions for his Soul, his troubles of mind grew ſo intolerable, that he told ſome, <hi>that he was weary of his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Enemies of Souls doubtleſs were not wanting in their endeavours with him, to carry all things the wrong way. For he ſaid, he was advis'd, <hi>To drink away his troubles; To kill his troubles of mind by drinking of Strong Drink to exeeſs</hi>: And he owned, <hi>That he had tried ſeveral times, what this way would do; but he found by ſad experience, that this was not the right way to get eaſe, for the troubles of his mind returned as the Spirits of the Drink removed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things grew ſo uncomfortable with him, that he loved not Home; he thought that all his Neighbours looked ſtrangely upon him; he pretended that he feared ſome body deſigned miſchief againſt him, and that he ſhould be ſlain. Every day ſeemed unto him as it if would be the laſt day of his life: And he asked of others, <hi>if they knew of no contrivance againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Day before he committed his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he appeared mightily diſtreſſed, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about in a very great agony, a great part of that day, chuſing to be at the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But on the ſaid day of his Murders, (22 <hi>d.</hi> 1 <hi>m</hi>) he got and ſat upon his Houſe,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:039607_0005_10147DCB8F5A9678"/>
with a Penknife in his hand, for ſeveral hours, if diſcourſing ſometimes with thoſe that came near him, ſeeming afraid ſome or other would hurt him; Others feared more that he would hurt himſelf; none ſeemed much to fear that he intended any hurt to any body elſe. And he declar'd, <hi>that he would hurt neither Man, Woman nor Child, if they would let him alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he came down from his Houſe top into his Chamber, he kept there moſt part of the Afternoon of that day, until after Sun ſet; and then his Wife, and her Siſter, upon his invitation, going up to him, urging of him to go down with them, or ſtriving with him to keep him from hurting of himſelf; it ſeems that then he ſtruck his Wife in her throat with his Pen-knife; and then ſtruck her and her Siſter down with an Ax (that he had carried up, and he had alſo Charged his Gun; but made no uſe of that, in his Murders) how many blows he gave them, is not known: But the dreadful marks of ſeveral remained on their miſerably man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled Bodies.</p>
            <p>When he had murdered them, he ſtood watchfully upon his Guard, with his Ax in hand, threatning all that offered to come up Stairs; knock'd one man down with his bloody Ax. Others endeavouring to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, by breaking up the Chamber Floor under him, &amp; the Roof over him; he laboured to defend himſelf, as if againſt the worſt Enemies. And when they carried ſome Fire, flaming to light their way before them,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:039607_0006_10147D97956F1F20"/>
he ſnatch'd away the Fire, and laid it among ſome combuſtible matter, and got ready more, and quickly kindled a great Fire in the midſt of the Chamber, as if he choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Burn himſelf alive, and the deal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with him than to be taken: but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chamber quickly growing too hot for him, and he being very hot with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant motion; he ſprung out headlong at the Window among the People, that were now ſurrounding of his Houſe.</p>
            <p>At ſome time or other, in theſe hurries it ſeems, he had cut his own throat; but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that death would not come ſoon enough that way, and finding that he could not bear burning to death; it was thought, he was willing to try, if he could daſh himſelf to pieces, by throwing himſelf out at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; by which he alſo hurt his head, if no other part of his Body; but his Wounds were near healed, before he came to Dye.</p>
            <p>After his Apprehenſion, he ſeemed for ſome time too ſtupid and ſoftiſh, and willing to palliate his Murders, pretending fear that others intended to Murder him; and that he did what, he did in an hurry.</p>
            <p>And when he was carried next day to ſee the Murdered Bodies, he acknowledged that it was a ſad ſight; but none ſeemed more unconcern'd at the ſadneſs of the ſight than he, that had moſt reaſon of all to be ſadly concern'd at ſuch an amazing Spectacle.</p>
            <p>In the time of his Impriſonment, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained too long wonderfully inſenſible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the miſerable condition of his Soul,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:039607_0007_10147DCD2698A168"/>
yet mighty ready to reſent provocations; whereof it muſt be confeſſed, that he had enough. Too many perſons coming to him, and ſome of them none of the beſt, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beſt deſigns, very much hindered the well improvement of his flying time, to the beſt advantage: Notwithſtanding he ſeemed under continual expectation that he muſt dye for his Murders; and was deſirous of the Prayers and Counſels, that he tho't might be for his benefit, and willing to Read and Hear good Books to direct and aſſiſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite his Preparation for Death; but ſeemed moſt of all to prize the Holy Bible; and by degrees came to a better ſenſe of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Circumſtances, and frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he valued not this World, if he might be well prepared for a better; and was obſerved ſeveral times in Priſon to warn others that came near him <hi>to Shun thoſe wayes of Sins, that he had found pernicious to himſelf</hi>; and was mightily concern'd for the Welfare of his poor Children, <hi>that they might be bro't up in the fear of God, and brought under the wings and the bonds of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> The ſtill more hopeful tokens of a real work of Saving Grace upon his own heart would have been very deſirable; tho' he was not without repeated intreaties of Prayer, that he might be made thorowly ſenſible of his Wickedneſs, and prepared for Pardon thro' the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>At his Tryal, (<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>D.</hi> 2 <hi>M</hi> 1715.) he could not deny the Murders, but pleaded, that he
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:039607_0008_10147D99AF857F30"/>
was not himſelf, and ſo knew not what he did, when he committed them. Though he could remember the circumſtances of the Murders. And his Neighbours generally thought that he knew what he was doing, notwithſtanding his being in ſuch an hurry; none ſeemed at any loſt about his being brought in Guilty.</p>
            <p>After his Condemnation (9 <hi>D.</hi> 2 <hi>M.</hi>) he ſeemed more penſive and penitent than ever before, in all the time of his Impriſonment. Expreſſing his deſires to ſubmit to the Will of God, praying, that God would prepare him for his Will; deſiring the prayers, and the helps of others, for ſuch Preparation; bewailing and lamenting his own miſerable Condition, as well as the diſtreſſes occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by him, unto his Relations; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly unto his Aged Parents, and his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children; for whom he deſired not only the Compaſſions of Heaven, but alſo the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of his Friends upon Earth, for the good of their Souls.</p>
            <p>In the laſt night that he lived, he ſeemed moſt of all concerned about his Condition, mourning as if his heart were indeed ready to break; pouring out his ſighs and groans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; willing to hear his attendants read in good Books, and eſpecially in the Bible. Asking their Prayers for and with him, that he might be prepar'd for his approaching End.</p>
            <p>As the time of his Execution drew near, he manifeſted no reluctancy to attend it; only he complained, that the time between
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:039607_0009_10147DCF45965410"/>
the Sentence and his Death was very ſhort; ben he was told, that it was much longer than what he allowed unto thoſe whom he had murdered, and that he had lived longer by near three weeks, than he would have ſuffered himſelf to have lived, had he been left unto his own will.</p>
            <p>He deſired that God would furniſh him with Courage to Glorify his Name, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Terrors of Death.</p>
            <p>As he drew near to the Place of his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he ſeemed mightily amazed; but ſo recovered, as to utter ſeveral things, that were by ſome accounted conſiderable; ſome of them are preſerved.</p>
            <p>But in all the Expreſſions that he uttered, when he came to Dy, he pretended unto no more hopes concerning the good State of his Soul, than what might be implied in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of an abſolute Reſignation to the Will of God; with entire dependance on the free Grace, the Infinite Sovereign Mercy of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But now he is gone from among the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it becomes all the Living to hope the beſt they can concerning him, and to leave Secret Things with the Lord, to whom they belong; and to mind the revealed Will of God about their own Duty, for the good of their own Souls, and the Souls of others, whom they are yet capable of benefiting; and to make the beſt improvement they can of all ſuch Tragical Examples, for their own advantage; and to learn by the harms of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to keep clear from the like harms, and
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:039607_0010_10147D9BCE882F30"/>
make ſure about their own ſeaſonable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the end of all the Living; and conſtantly remember the repeated and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Admonition of our Bleſſed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in Luke 13.3, 5. <hi>Suppoſe ye, that theſe who have ſufferd ſo ſad things, are therefore greater Sinners than others. I tell you, no; but except you Repent, you ſhall all likewiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <q>Oh! That all People might be Warn'd againſt needleſly forſaking the Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, and the faithful Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of Chriſt, leſt they run themſelves into more terrible diſtreſſes, than they can eaſily imagine, among their Ungodly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who will not be able to help them out of their Diſtreſſes, when they have left God, and God hath left them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This poor man acknowledged in the time of his Impriſonment, that he had forſaken God, and God had forſaken him, and then every thing ſeemed againſt him, and he wiſh'd, '<hi>Oh! that I had thought of any faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend, to whom I could have been willing to have gone for advice, in the time of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs.</hi> But he could own, that he lived ſo, that he was afraid or aſham'd of coming into the preſence of any ſuch Friend. He bitterly bewailed his leaving the Means of Grace that he had enjoyed in his Youth.</p>
            <p>And,
<q>Oh! that all People might be warned againſt wickedly grieving the Holy
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:039607_0011_10147DD1A0426088"/>
Spirit of God, by Sinning againſt the light of their own Conſciences; doing of thoſe ill things, that they know ſhould not be done; or not doing thoſe good things, that they know ſhould be done: For if the Holy Spirit goes from a Soul, then comes the Evil Spirit to that Soul; and when he comes, he will be a Spirit of Slumber, as long as he can, to keep the Soul ſecure in a ſtate, and in ſome way of Sin: But when he can keep the Soul no longer ſecure, but the Soul muſt, by ſome means or other be awakened, to ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its own forlorn Condition; then he will be a Spirit of Terror, and will fill the Soul, wherein he dwells, with terrible Diſtreſs, that may at length iſſue in horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſpair.</q>
This poor man could ſay, that he feared that he ſhould be Damned at laſt; and thought ſometimes that he would ſtrive to be as wicked as the Devil could make him; and yielded to every deſperate Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions about his own Soul, (as hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) long before his Murders.</p>
            <p>And,
<q>Oh! That all People might be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualy warned againſt all beginnings of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions from God; and to take heed, left there be in any of them, an evil heart of Unbelief, in departing from the Living God; leſt they find the Lord caſting them off for ever, and his Soul taking no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them. For when People begin to decline from God, and from Good, they know not where they ſhall ſtop: They
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:039607_0012_10147D9D538427A0"/>
know not what Miſchiefs and Miſeries they are apace running into; nor how ſoon they ſhall be overwhelmed with aſtoniſhing Deſolations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This poor man left this awful Warning with his Neighbours, and told them ſeveral times, that he could well remember, that when he began to caſt off the Fear of God, and leave the practices of Godlineſs, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelf in Evil Courſes, he as little thought as any of them all, that he ſhould ſo ſoon come to ſuch a miſerable End. <hi>Let them then, that think they ſtand, take heed leſt the fall: And therefore Commit the keeping of their Souls to God, in Well-doing, as unto a Faithful Creator.</hi>

            <p>TO underſtand the intention of any Text of Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is frequently advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to conſider the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Text, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with other Texts, and with the whole current of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion of this Text, we may learn
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039607_0023_10147DDF930D3E38"/>
from the Title of the Pſalm wherein we find it, compared with the eleventh and twelfth Chapters of the ſecond Book of <hi>Samuel.</hi> There we find, that <hi>David,</hi> a man after God's own Heart, was left unto very infandous, horrendous Crimes: Not only execrable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, but alſo horrid Murder, and very ungodly endeavours to conceal thoſe Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes; were among his Crimes. The beſt of Saints may fall into the worſt of Sins, if God leave them to themſelves. [Then what great Sins may graceleſs Sinners fall into, while under the power, and in the poſſeſſion of Satan!] Yea, the beſt of Saints may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a long time under the guilt of their Sins, that they fall into: How long! <hi>David</hi> continued a long time under the guilt of his Crimes; it doth not appear that there was any evidence of any Repentance for his Wickedneſs, for a long ſpace after his crimes were committed. But after a long time, the Lord ſent his Miniſter, <hi>Nathan,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to convince him of his Wickedneſs, and to bring him to Repentance. It is very ſure, that Sinners will never think of repentance of Sin, or turning to God, if the Lord ſhould not call, or look after them; Our firſt Father <hi>Adam</hi> thought not of repenting of Sin, before the Lord call'd after him; and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> thought not of repenting of his Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord looked upon him. The God of all Grace in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with infinite Compaſſion to miſerable Sinners, calls after them, to repent and turn to him, from all their tranſgreſſions, with hopes of Pardon
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039607_0024_10147DAAE9CD2818"/>
for the ſake of Chriſt. Thus it is with all that live under the Goſpel: And God will certainly recover from their falls thoſe that are Saints indeed, He will not ſuffer them to periſh for ever in their Sins, how great and ſad ſoever have been their falls. They ſhall be recovered before they dye; So was <hi>David.</hi> When the Miniſter of God had brought him to a ſight and a ſenſe of his Wickedneſs, them <hi>David</hi> acknowledges that he had ſinned. He acknowledged his Wickedneſs with a repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul; God helping him to repent with brokenneſs of Heart; with an heart broken for Sin, and from Sin.</p>
            <p>A Promiſe of Pardon is immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto the repenting Sinner: <hi>The Lord hath put away thy Sin, thou ſhalt not dye.</hi> God is ready to bring home pardon to the truly Penitent. Sinners can't be more forward in repenting of their Sins, than God in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Souls, and making them ſenſible of his pardoning mercy upon their expreſſing of their unfeigned Repentance. <hi>Thou, Lord art Good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee, that call upon thee in truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after the Miniſter of God had finiſhed his Meſſage from the Lord unto <hi>David,</hi> then <hi>David</hi> compoſed this Pſalm, for the uſe of the Church of God in all After-Ages. When ſinful perſons become repenting Sinners, they will be concerned for the Glory of God, and for the good of others They will be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that God might be Glorified by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they will be willing to do all they
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039607_0025_10147DE1B51E09A8"/>
can for the Glory of God, and they will be willing to excite others to Glorify God; and therefore to excite them to Repentance, that they may Glorify God. And they will be deſirous that their own Repentance may be as much known as ever their Wickedneſs hath been known. The Sin of <hi>David,</hi> was by the wonderful Providence of God brought into open view, before the World; ſo that the Enemies of the Lord thereupon took occaſion to blaſpheme the Holy Name of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> was willing that his Repentance might be openly and publickly known, that God might be thereby Glorified; that his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour might as much as poſſible, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; that if the People of God ſhould be reproached, and ſo the Name of God be diſhonoured by any wicked People, twitting of Godly People, and telling of them. <hi>Ay, ſee what your</hi> David <hi>hath done, what deteſtable Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he hath been guilty of, and how abominably wicked he hath been, yet he is one of your great Saints:</hi> The People of God might be able truly to reply, <hi>'Tis true, we cannot but own it with ſhame and with grief, that</hi> David <hi>was guilty of great Sins againſt God. But we are alſo ſure, that he did truly repent of his great Sins: God gave him grace to repent, and to evidence his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance before the World, we have an excellent Pſalm of his own compoſing upon that very occaſion, that ſhews that he was truly penitent.</hi> The fifty firſt Pſalm is an everlaſting teſtimony to all Generations, that <hi>David</hi> was concerned to Glorify God, by evidencing of his Repentance.</p>
            <p>This will be the diſpoſition of all true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039607_0026_10147DAD9A9A4998"/>
They will be deſirous, that all their godly Neighbours may be furniſhed with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidences of their unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for all their Wickedneſs, that they may be able to do ſomething to ſtop the mouths of the blaſpheming enemies of the Lord, that are glad of any occaſions to reproach his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name.</p>
            <p>The ſcope of repenting <hi>David</hi> in this Pſalm, is to deſire of God that his Sins might be all pardoned, and his Adultry and his Murder, and that he might be cleanſed from Original Pollution, and might be made ſenſible of the pardon of all his Sins, and prepared to praiſe God for the forgiveneſs of his Wickedneſs; and he promiſes unto the Lord, that upon his comfortable apprehenſion of the pardon of his ſin, by the reſtoring of the joy of the Holy Spirit unto him, he would endeavour to promote the Glory of God, by furthering the Converſion of other Sinners. And he ſhews an earneſt deſire for the Proſperity of the People of God: He knew that he had exceedingly grieved them by his Miſcarriages, and he was concerned that they might ſhare with him in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations upon his Reconciliation with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Penitent Sinners that have grieved others by their Sins, will be deſirous that others may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to rejoyce in their Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our Context, we find the penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner declaring what would not ſatisfy God for his offences. None of the Sacrifices ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God in the Ceremonial Law, to be offered by his People, in their External

Worſhip, could ſatisfy for the wrongs that were done by Sin to the Majeſty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The Wrath of God could not be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by them, nor could they remove the guilt of ſin from the Soul of the Sinner. <hi>The blood of Bulls and of Goats could never take away Sins.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> fully underſtood, and he plainly declares to the World his firm belief, that none of the Levitical Sacrifices could make full ſatisfaction to Divine Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice for the ſins of any perſon but they had a reſpect unto ſome other thing. Then he declares what Sacrifices would be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God. <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit.</hi> May not this principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who being made a Sacrifice unto the Divine Juſtice, had his Spirit grievouſly broken by the wrath of God, while he was offering up himſelf a Sacrifice for the Sins of his People? He could ſay before he came to dye, <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death</hi>; and when he came to dye, <hi>he poured out his Soul unto death.</hi> His very Soul within him was dreadfully broken by the Anger of GOD, which he endured for the ſake of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they might be delivered from the Wrath to come. And altho' he were the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally beloved Son of God, yet appearing as the Surety for Sinners, the Wrath of God broke his very Spirit within him. And becauſe he was the Eternally Beloved Son of God, therefore he was the Sacrifice of God; a Sacrifice accepted with God, as well as appointed by God; Yea; he was
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039607_0028_10147DB00CF283A0"/>
himſelf God, truly and really God. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſon that was offered a Sacrifice for Sin, was God Tho' he ſuffered only as Man, the Divine Nature being uncapable of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, yet the Perſon that ſuffered was truly <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever:</hi> And ſo the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ſuch an One, was of infinite value &amp; virtue, and for that reaſon might be ſtyled, <hi>The Sacrifices of God.</hi> For, beſure the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was of more value infinitely than all the other Sacrifices that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to be offered; He was the Antytipe of them all, and as good as ten hundred thouſand millions of ſuch Sacrifices. Yea, infinitely better than all other Sacrifices. Thus being as good as all, better than all, he might be called <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> And he was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of ſuch value as to ſatisfy for the ſins of all that will accept of him for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, let them be never ſo many Souls; &amp; he is a Sacrifice of ſuch value, as to ſatisfy for all their Sins, if they believe on him, let their Sins be never ſo many; ſo may the Son of God be ſtyled, the <hi>Sacrifices of God. He is the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole World, both Jews and Gentiles, that believe in him as their Saviour</hi>; He is a Sacrifice for them all, for all their ſins. Yea, ſuch is the ſufficiency of the Merit of the Sacrifice of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that if all the Sinners in the world would believe on him, there is merit enough in his Blood to ſatisfy for all their ſins: Of ſuch value is his Blood, and therefore might he be called the <hi>Sacrifices of God.</hi> His Spirit having been broken, he is the <hi>Sacrifices of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039607_0029_10147DE921BB96F0"/>
God.</hi> Thro' him other things may be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God. For it follows in our Text, <hi>A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe</hi>· If the heart of a Sinner be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Sin, and from Sin, God will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe that heart, but he will for the ſake of the <hi>Sacrifices of God,</hi> ſhew favour to one that hath ſuch an heart. For there is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended than is expreſſed in the words. <hi>God will not deſpiſe a broken heart,</hi> that is; <hi>He will greatly delight in ſuch an heart, ſuch an heart will be acceptable with him.</hi> Tho' Sinners do not deſerve the favour of God by their broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, yet their brokenneſs of heart doth prepare Sinners for the favour of God; and he will certainly ſhew his favour to them, who have their hearts rightly broken with Evangelical Contrition.</p>

               <head>ANSWER:</head>
               <p>To this we may anſwer; Six things muſt be attended, and a ſeventh muſt not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Penitent Sinner, that would have a broken Heart acceptable with the Glorious God thro' Jeſus Chriſt. Let all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conſider the things now to be offered; and certainly the poor Condemned Priſoner, under a Sentence of Death, not likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy another Sabbath, before his paſſage into the Eternal World, will reckon himſelf under peculiar Obligations to conſider theſe things, to direct him to that brokenneſs of heart, that will be acceptable with God thro' Chriſt: <hi>Poor man, Hearing for your laſt, hear for your Life, your Life; The Life of your precious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul is concerned in what you are now hearing. And let all hear ſo, that their Souls may live; Hear ſo that you may find what you hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There muſt be ſome</hi> ILLUMINATION <hi>of the Mind, where there is that brokenneſs of Heart that will be acceptable with God through Chriſt.</hi> The Underſtanding muſt be enlightened if the heart be rightly broken. If the heart be never ſo much diſtreſſed, oppreſſed, Brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and broken by dreadful terrours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by fearful horrours, by amazing affrightments,

by aſtoniſhing expectations of the Wrath of GOD, juſt ready to be poured down upon the Soul; yet if there be no light in the mind, the heart is not rightly broken; If the mind be full of darkneſs, there may be ſome ſort of brokenneſs of heart, but not that which will be acceptable with God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt there be ſome illumination of the Underſtanding, to ſee ſomething about thoſe Truths of God, that will ſhew why the heart of a Sinner ſhould be broken. The broken hearted Sinner will have ſome underſtanding and conſideration about the righteouſneſs and the holineſs of God, about the odiouſneſs and heinouſneſs of ſin, about the juſtice and the ſtrictneſs of the Law of God, that is broken by ſin; about the certainty of the threatnings of the Law of God againſt ſin, about the dreadfulneſs of the puniſhment threatned for ſin, by the Law, and about the unavoidable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the puniſhment threatned, without full ſatisfaction to the Law, which cannot be without a perfect righteouſneſs every way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Law; but no ſuch righteouſneſs can he had beſides the Righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; nor can this Righteouſneſs be had without faith in Chriſt; and where there is true ſaving faith in Chriſt, there muſt and will be unfeigned repentance that breaks the heart for, and from ſin Such as theſe things muſt have ſome conſideration in the Penitent Sinner, that will have his heart ſo broken, as to be accepted with God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt there be not only ſome acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Law of God, but alſo ſome
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039607_0032_10147DB3AD09C130"/>
conſideration what that Law requires, and what that Law forbids: Thence might the Penitent ſay, as in Rom. 7.7. <hi>I had not known ſin, but by the law; by the law is the knowledge of ſin.</hi> Sinners muſt have their minds enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law of God, that they may come to ſee their ſins, before they will have their hearts broken ſo as to be acceptable with God. The eyes of Sinners muſt be opened ſo as to ſee ſomething of their miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before their hearts will be rightly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Light muſt break into their Souls, that they may ſee how things are in their Souls, before their hearts will be rightly broken. The Law muſt be conſidered, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Law, that Sin againſt the Law may appear unto Sinners to be exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, before their hearts will be duly broken for, and from ſin. If the heart of the Sinner be duly broken, then will the Repenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be able truly to ſay, <hi>Now I ſee ſomething of the Righteouſneſs of the Holy God, and I muſt acknowledge the holineſs of his righteous Law; his Law is holy, juſt and good, therefore Sin which breaks that Law, muſt be an evil and a bitter thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Examine then upon this Article as we paſs along, and conſider, every Soul. Is your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſo enlightned as to ſee the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and the holineſs of God; to ſee the odiouſneſs and the heinouſneſs of Sin; to ſee the juſtice and the ſtrictneſs of the Law of God; to ſee the certainty of the threatnings of the Law, to ſee the dreadfulneſs of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment threatned by the Law upon the breakers of the Law; to ſee the inevitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:039607_0033_10147DF11CE28800"/>
of the threatned puniſhment, without a full ſatisfaction to the Law, which cannot be without a perfect Righteouſneſs, every way anſwering the Law; and that there is no ſuch Righteouſneſs to be had, beſides the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and this cannot be had without faith in him; and this faith muſt be attended with unfeigned Repentance, to which belongs brokenneſs of heart for, and from Sin? Do you ſee ſomething about the reality of theſe things? If you ſee nothing about them, it is not likely that your hearts will be rightly broken: But if your minds are enlightned ſo as to ſee, and conſider and realize theſe and ſuch things, there is room to hope that ſomething is doing toward breaking of your hearts with a Goſpel Contrition.</p>
               <p>But then,</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>There muſt be ſome</hi> CONVICTION <hi>upon the Conſcience, where there is that brokenneſs of heart that will be acceptable with God through Chriſt.</hi> This Conviction doth conſiſt in a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal &amp; particular application of guilt &amp; wrath unto the Sinners own Soul, ſo as to bring the Sinner to an acknowledgment like this; <hi>If the Word of God be true, then my Soul is in a miſerable Condition.</hi> For as long as notions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the head as airy, empty ſpeculations, without coming down into the heart, with a powerful impreſſion upon the Soul, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners never have their hearts duly broken; let their notions be never ſo good and right. The Righteouſneſs of God, and his Holineſs,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039607_0034_10147DB6620770E8"/>
the juſtice and ſtrictneſs of his Law may be acknowledged, ſin may be conſidered as an evil and hateful thing; but the Sinner will not be affected with the evilneſs and the hatefulneſs of ſin, without ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction upon the Conſcience, whereby a ſenſe of the evil of ſin is brought nigh unto the Soul, and the weight of ſin is laid upon the Soul. For as the heavieſt weights while at a diſtance, will not bruiſe nor break, but when they are laid upon us, then they may bruiſe and break us: Thus while Sinners conſider of the evil in ſin at a diſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any application of the guilt of Sin to their own Souls, in their conſiderations, they will not have their ſinful heart rightly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Therefore is there a neceſſity of that thing, in <hi>John</hi> 16.8. <hi>The Spirit convincing of ſin.</hi> There muſt be a work of the Holy Spirit of God, bringing home conviction upon the Soul of the Sinner, ſo as to lay ſomething of the weight of guilt upon the Soul, in order to a right brokenneſs of heart. The Sinner muſt come to acknowledge, <hi>I know Sin to be in it ſelf an evil thing, becauſe it is a tranſgreſſion of the juſt law of a Good God, and I feel my ſelf guilty of ſuch evil before the Lord; I have tranſgreſſed the Law of God, the guilt of Sin lies upon my Soul; and I am ſenſible of ſomething of the burthen of ſin.</hi> So it muſt be with the Sinner, that his heart may be rightly broken. <hi>David</hi> might be produced as an inſtance of this. He might hear abundance of Sermons Preached about Repentance, while he was under the guilt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039607_0035_10147DF34BAD1ED8"/>
of ſin, but none of them ſeemed to break his heart, until the Holy Spirit of God, by a particular application of the Truth of God in the Miniſtry of the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid, <hi>You</hi> David <hi>are the man that is guilty of all the Wickedneſs that you have condemned; for you have done ſo and ſo, and have broken the Laws of God, and have deſerved the Wrath and Curſe of God, the guilt of Sin lies upon your Soul.</hi> This particular application, by the Holy Spirit of God, in the Miniſtry of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet began to make ſome tendency toward the breaking of the heart of ſinful <hi>David.</hi> And ſo, when the Spirit of God will pleaſe to ſet home Conviction upon the Conſcience of the guilty Sinner, and bring him to ſee and own that he hath been guilty of thoſe things for which the Wrath of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the Law of God, againſt the Children of Diſobedience, who break that Law; then may there be ſome room to hope that the heart will be rightly broken.</p>
               <p>Examine then upon this Article, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, every Soul; <hi>Have you not only had your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Illuminated about the truth of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring unto the Evil of Sin, ſo as to ſee, that Sin in it ſelf is an evil thing and a bitter; but have you alſo had ſuch a Conviction upon your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that you do feel the burden of Sin? Do you feel the dreadful weight of the guilt of ſin upon your Soul? Is your Soul burthened with the guilt of ſin?</hi> If there be no ſuch Conviction upon the Conſcience, it is no wonder if there be no brokenneſs of heart. But if there be ſuch Conviction upon the Conſcience, then is there
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039607_0036_10147DB7F89778F8"/>
ſomething done toward breaking of the heart. But there muſt be ſtill ſomething more done, before the heart will be rightly broken, ſo as to be acceptable with God. For,</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>There muſt be a diſtreſſing</hi> AFFLICTION <hi>of Soul, attending of this Conviction upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, where there is the brokenneſs of heart, that will be acceptable with God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Soul muſt be made ſo ſenſible of the burden of Sin, as to be affected, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly <hi>afflicted</hi> with that dreadful burden, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heart is duly broken. Perſons may acknowledge that Sin is Evil, and they may be ſenſible, that ſin hath done much evil to them, and that it deſerves the Wrath and Curſe of God for ever; and they may be convinced, that they are guilty of ſin, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of guilt lies upon their Souls; and yet they may not be very much afflicted in their Souls, becauſe of their ſins: their ſins may ſeem ſomewhat burthenſome, yet they are but light burdens to them, or tolerable; they can ſtill bear the burden of their ſins; the burden of ſin is not altogether inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, at leaſt they think that they are able to endure it a little longer. The hearts of theſe Sinners be not duly broken. For if the heart be rightly broken for ſin, the Soul muſt be diſtreſſed and afflicted, becauſe of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſin, ſo as to be able to ſay like him, in Pſal. 40.12. <hi>Innumerable evils have compaſſed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head, therefore my heart
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039607_0037_10147DF4D7C88BF8"/>
faileth me:</hi> Or like him, in Pſal. 38.4. <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my head as an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, too heavy for me to bear.</hi> When Sinners come to this, then is there ſome room to hope that their ſinful hearts will be rightly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but as long as they can bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of their ſins beſure they have not that brokenneſs of heart that will be acceptable with God; for <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> If the heart be rightly broken, it cannot eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear up under the burden of ſin: The burden of ſin will ſink the broken heart ſo as to make it long for deliverance from that burden. Sinners may know and own, that Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, Lying, Stealing, prophane Swearing and Curſing, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the Name of God, Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Diſobedience to Superiours, and Malice, Envy, Diſcontent, as well as Murder and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heinous Crimes, are great ſins before God; but as long as they do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves guilty of any of theſe Crimes, their hearts will not be broken, how guilty ſoever they are of theſe Crimes. Yea, Sinners may know and own themſelves to be guilty of theſe and thoſe crimes; Conſcience may tell one perſon, <hi>You are a Drunkard</hi>; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, <hi>You walk in ſome way of Uncleanneſs?</hi> another perſon, <hi>You are guilty of Lying or Stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or prophane Swearing, Curſing</hi>; another perſon, <hi>You are a Sabbath-breaker, diſobedient to Superiours, guilty of Malice, Envy, Dſicontent, or ſome other Wickedneſs.</hi> But if Sinners can bear theſe and ſuch intimations of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto them, without feeling any ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039607_0038_10147DB9A26582F0"/>
heavy burden, but what they can bear up their Spirits under it, their hearts be not rightly broken. Sinners may be convinced, without being converted. This is plain. The Hearers of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when they were told of their Wickedneſs in Crucifying the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>They were pricked to their hearts</hi>; their hearts began to be rightly broken. But the Hearers of the Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> while they were told of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in reſiſting the Holy Spirit, they were <hi>cut to the heart.</hi> Their hearts were after a manner bruiſed, and pierced, and vexed, but not rightly broken. They went on ſtill in Wickedneſs. Thence it appears that Sinners may have ſome ſenſe of ſin, without having their hearts rightly broken for, and from ſin. There may be ſome knowledge, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the evil that is in ſin, as well as of the evil that comes by ſin, without any right brokenneſs of heart: But where there is a right brokenneſs of heart, there will be affliction of Soul, becauſe of the burden of ſin: Conſcience muſt not only be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but muſt alſo be quickned and excited to do its duty toward the convinced Sinner; to make the Sinner conſider with trembling, <hi>I have provoked the righteous and holy God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed my ſelf unto his terrible diſpleaſure: What ſhall I do to eſcape the Wrath of God?</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reveals the Wrath of God unto the Sinner, when the heart is rightly broken, ſo as to make the Soul of the Sinner full of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and anguiſh, and to have ſecret wiſhes like theſe: <hi>Oh, that I had never been! Oh, that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039607_0039_10147DF8CA48C830"/>
I had never Sinned as I have done! Oh, that I might ceaſe to be; or my Sin taken away, ſo as to lie no longer upon my Soul! Oh, that I might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Vengeance of Eternal Fire, that is due to me for Sin! How can I dwell with Devouring Fire! How ſhall I dwell with Everlaſting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? What ſhall I do to be Saved?</hi> Such O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Spirit of God working by Conſcience, are in the Souls of the Sinners that have their ſinful hearts rightly broken for ſin. There muſt be ſome work of the Law upon the Soul, to bring the Sinner into diſtreſs by reaſon of ſin. The Law of God, or the Spirit of God by the Law, muſt rouſe up the Sinner, to ſmite him and laſh him for ſin, before there will be that brokenneſs of heart, that will be acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>Indeed, there will not be the like degrees of diſtreſs in the Souls of all Sinners, that have their hearts duly broken for Sin.</p>
               <p>Some Sinners may have greater terrours, and of longer continuance than others.</p>
               <p>God may work more gradually with ſome than with others; for the holy Spirit of God is an arbitrary Agent: He may act how he pleaſes, and where and when he pleaſes. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> and ſo the Spirit of God may work as he pleaſeth. And ſo ſome ſecure Sinners may be awakened out of their ſinful Security, as with a ſtrong Wind, or a loud Voice, or as with dreadful Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that may ſeem at once to break their ſinful Hearts all to ſhivers. They may like the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his conviction, be ſtruck down by the mighty power of God, or like
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039607_0040_10147DBBD6F98BC8"/>
the convinced Jaylor, be ſtruck with dreadful Fear, what will become of their Souls for ever. And ſome of theſe may be ſpeedily raiſed up and revived and comforted and ſtrengthned, and have their Eyes opened quickly, and their Souls refreſhed and filled with abundance of ſweet Conſolations from God. Others may lye longer under bitter diſtreſs of Soul. The terrours of God may abide upon them and ſeem to drink up their Spirits. They may go mourning under the burden of their Sins a long time, and may walk in heavineſs of Soul, until they cry out, <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever, will he be favourable no more?</hi> God may for holy Reaſons, keep them long under trouble of Soul. Sometimes to make them own that his Grace is free, or to make them cry the more fervently for his Grace, or to make them prize comfort the more, and to be the more thankful for it, when it is beſtowed, or to prepare them for the greater Conſolations. Other ſecure Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be awakened out of their ſinful Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, as with a ſmall Wind, or a ſtill Voice, or as with pleaſant Whiſpers, that ſeem to delight their Souls: The Lord may ſecretly open their Hearts to receive his Grace, and as when <hi>Samuel</hi> was to be ſet about the work of God, the Lord call'd him in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that there ſeemed no greater concernment or amazement than what had been uſual up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Spirit: So may ſome Sinners be brought home to God with leſs preſſure from the burden of their Sins than ſome other Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And of theſe there may be ſome that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039607_0041_10147DFB70D144C8"/>
have comfort quickly beſtowed upon them, in the light of Gods countenance lifted up over their Souls. They may lye but a ſhort time under their diſtreſs of Soul by reaſon of the burden of their Sins. Others may have their diſtreſſes abiding longer upon them. They may continue a great while under the work of the Spirit, as a Spirit of bondage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they find him working as a Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption upon their Souls. But ſtill we muſt beſure that all Sinners that have their Hearts broken ſo as to be accepted with God, feel Sin to be a grievous burthen to their Souls. They are made willing to get rid of that burden. They cann't bear to think of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the burden of Sin. The burden of Sin is of all burdens the moſt intollerable. And if they underſtand that they muſt wait upon God in the uſe of the means of Grace for the influences of his holy Spirit, to draw them to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; They will pray in ſecret and with others, and deſire others to pray for them, and if they can, with them; They will, (if they can) read the Word of God, and hear his Word, and beg of God, to ſet home his truths upon their Souls, that their Souls may be ſtill more burthened with Sin, that they may ſtill be more ſenſible of their burthen, ſo as to be made really willing to part with Sin. They will pray that God would for the ſake of Chriſt by his holy Spirit, apply the pardoning, ſoftning, healing Blood of Chriſt unto their Souls, and unite their Souls to Chriſt by a living Faith, and make an

everlaſting ſeparation between their Souls and their Sins, that their Souls might enjoy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from all their Sins, for ever. Thus it will be with them, whoſe Hearts be rightly broken for Sin.</p>
               <p>Examine then upon this Article and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, every Soul; <hi>Are you ſo burthened with Sin, ſo Afflicted for Sin, that you are willing to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated eternally from all Sin? Would it rejoyce your Souls, if you might now be delivered from ſo bitter an evil as the being of Sin in your Soul, and might have no more Sin for ever?</hi> If there be nothing of this, nothing like this, there is no right brokenneſs of Heart. But if there be a willingneſs to be ſeparated from all Sin for ever; and a gladneſs that God will uſe any means to ſeparate from Sin, then is there ſome room to hope that the Heart begins to be broken. Affliction of Soul by reaſon of the burden of Sin, will drive the repenting Sinner to Supplication before the Lord for deliverance from Sin with hopes of Pardon for the ſake of Chriſt, if the Heart ever be ſo broken as to be accepted with the Lord: But theſe things muſt be accompany'd with another thing: For</p>
               <p n="4">(IV.) HUMILIATION <hi>before the Lord, will be where there is that brokenneſs of Heart that will be acceptable with God thro' Chriſt.</hi> Indeed herein doth chiefly conſiſt the eſſence of that brokenneſs of heart, that God will not deſpiſe: when the Heart comes to be ſo humble as to ſubmit and ſubject it ſelf entirely unto the divine will, to ſay, <hi>Let the Lord do to me as
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039607_0043_10147DFCFA5205F0"/>
ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> Then the Heart begins to be rightly broken, when the will of the Sinner is reſigned unto, and reſolved and as it were diſſolved into the will of the Creator. An humble Heart is a broken Heart. The broken hearted Sinner may acknowledge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, in Lam. 3.19. <hi>Remembring my Affliction and my Miſery, the Wormwood and the Gall, my Soul hath them ſtill in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</hi> Then a broken Heart muſt be an humbled Heart. And there muſt ſhame and grief, as well as reſignation to the will of God, and confeſſion of Sin to God and others, in that humiliation that will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a broken Heart. The broken hearted Sinner muſt be aſhamed that ever he ſhould ſo grievouſly offend ſo gracious and merciful a God, as the Lord hath been unto him. Shame and bluſhing ſhould cover his Soul, when he looks unto the Lord againſt whom he hath Sinn'd and he ſhould be able truly to ſay, <hi>Lord, I am aſhamed to look up to thee, becauſe of my Sinfulneſs.</hi> And he muſt be grieved for that he hath diſhonoured God, the Father, wounded God the Son, griev'd the holy ſpirit of God, and wronged his own Soul, and occaſioned miſchief to others by ſinning againſt God; And he ſhould be able truly to ſay, <hi>I am exceeding ſorry, for that I ever ſinned againſt God. Oh, that I had not ſo ſinned, Oh, that I might no more ſin as I have done!</hi> Then there muſt follow ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to God, as to be willing that what methods God ſees beſt, may be taken for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and preſervation from Sin. The
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:039607_0044_10147DC0A8C47E30"/>
broken Heart muſt be willing to yield to God in every thing, and to ſay upon the hardeſt and ſaddeſt things, <hi>The will of the Lord be done</hi> The Heart is not ſufficiently broken, as long as there is any continued reluctancy or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the will of God: See the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the broken-hearted ſinner, in Jer. 31 19. <hi>Thou has chaſtiſed me and I was chaſtiſed, as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the Yoak; Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God: Surely after I was turned, I repented, and after I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh; I was aſham'd yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my Youth.</hi> And there muſt be confeſſion of Sin to God <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. Such an humble Heart muſt that broken Heart be that is accepted with the glorious God. Thence when Penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners come to have their hearts truly broken, they are ſo humble, that they can bear any wrongs, miſchiefs, injuries, indignities from any of their Fellow-Creatures, becauſe of their ſins againſt God: Thence all the trou-of this Life are accounted but ſmall troubles unto Penitent Sinners; becauſe they are humbled ſo, as to ſee that they deſerve great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſorer than ever they have endured. They will own, <hi>It is of the Lord's mercy that we are not conſum'd.</hi> And they will be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the leaſt mercies, conſidering that they deſerve no mercy, but are leſs than the leaſt of all the mercies of God; and will ſay, <hi>As long as I am out of Hell, I have cauſe to be thankful to God for his mercy to my Soul: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God pleaſes to do with me, he is juſt in all.

The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his Works.</hi> Theſe things will be in the Humiliation of the Repenting Sinner, whoſe Broken Heart will be accepted with God thro' Chriſt. Then,</p>
               <p>Examine upon this, and Conſider, every Soul, <hi>Are you ſo humbled before the Lord, that you can ſincerely ſubmit to the Will of GOD? Are you willing that God ſhould do what he will with you, ſo that he will preſerve you from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring his Holy Name, and ſave you from Hell; and improve you to Glorify him here, and in Heaven for ever?</hi> If there be nothing of this Humiliation before the Lord, there is not that brokenneſs of heart that will be accepted with God. But if there be ſuch Humiliation before the Lord, then the heart begins to be well broken; but if it be ſo broken, there will another thing be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying theſe things. For,</p>
               <p n="5">V. INDIGNATION <hi>toward Sin will be, where there is that brokenneſs of heart that the Glorious God will accept.</hi> For if Sin hath broke the heart, and if the heart be broken for, and from Sin, there muſt be an hatred of Sin; Sin will be abhorr'd by a broken heart: The broken-hearted Sinner thinks about Sin, <hi>Oh, It is a vile thing!</hi> And this hatred unto ſin muſt be an univerſal hatred againſt all ſins; for ſmall, ſecret, ſpiritual ſins muſt be hated as well as great, open, more ſenſible and viſible ſins; yea, if the heart be rightly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſome one particular ſtream of ſin will carry the Soul unto the conſideration of the

ſpring of Sin, the fountain of Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; ſo that the Sinner will be able to ſay, with ſhame and ſorrow, and bitterneſs of Soul, as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.5. <hi>In Iniquity was I ſhapen, and conceived in Sin.</hi> He muſt own, <hi>Sin dwelleth in me</hi>; my heart is full of ſin, and therefore is there juſt reaſon for it to be broken; <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> He muſt be able to ſay, <hi>I hate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very falſe way, I hate vain thoughts.</hi> I allow the Law to be ſpiritual, and to reach to my Soul, and to all the aims and frames of my Soul; and therefore ſhould I be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at ſpiritual ſins, and mourn for the ſinful inclinations and diſpoſitions of my Soul; and hate ſin ſo, as to abſtain from all appearance of evil. Yea, the broken-hearted Sinner will bewail and lament his condition in thoſe terms, in Rom. 7.24. <hi>O wretched one that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death!</hi> He will not be ſatisfy'd as long as he hath any remainders of In-dwelling Corruption: All ſin hath bitterneſs in it, and therefore doth he hate all ſin with a bitter, and a vehement, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, irreconcileable hatred. For this hatred unto ſin, muſt be a continual hatred, as well as univerſal. Sin muſt never be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, allowed, tolerated in a broken heart, which God will accept. Then,</p>
               <p>Examine upon this, and conſider, Every Soul; <hi>Do you hate, and abhor, and abominate every Sin: Can't you endure to be defiled with any Sin? Would it be the rejoycing of your Soul, if you might preſently be delivered from the very

Jeſus Chriſt, there can be no brokenneſs of heart; for God out of Chriſt, will be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire to Sinners; their ſinful hearts may indeed be broken by that fire, but not ſo, as to be accepted with God, and received into his favour; but if the heart be rightly broken, there muſt be that thing, in Zech. 12.10. <hi>A looking upon him that was pierced, becauſe of Sin.</hi> Such a look muſt cauſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Soul, and brokenneſs of heart in Penitent Sinners. To think, we have pierced the heart of the dearly beloved Son of God, by our ſins, this muſt break our ſinful hearts, if they are ever duly broken. We have had ſome intimations that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath been the Sacrifices of God, and that his heart was broken, becauſe of our ſins. Our ſins have broken the heart of Chriſt. But we muſt conſider him, that our hearts may be broken: <hi>Conſider him who was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities, and upon him was the chaſtiſement of our peace, and by whoſe ſtripes we may be healed.</hi> Conſider the heart-breaking diſtreſs that our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt underwent for the ſake of miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinners; <hi>Whole the Lord laid upon Him the Iniquity of us all.</hi> Conſider what he endured when his heart was broken within him, and melted like wax, and he was poured like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his Soul was ſore amazed, even unto death; and he prayed, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me:</hi> And after that cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The holy heart of the Son of God was broken ſo, that he offered prayers
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:039607_0050_10147E2B12951098"/>
and ſupplications, and ſtrong crying with tears, before God. Yea, his heart was ſo broken, that he ſweat great drops of blood in his agony before his Crucifixion; but after this, his ſide was pierced with a ſpear, ſo that blood came from his heart. But why was all this? Wherefore was the heart of the Son of God ſo broken? It was that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might have their ſinful hearts broken ſo as to be prepared for the pardoning mercy of God. And it was that the Juſtice of God might be ſatisfied, and their Souls delivered from the guilt and filth of ſin. The heart of Chriſt was broken, that his Blood might be applied to believing Sinners, for the remiſſion of their ſins, and the ſalvation of their Souls, Theſe things muſt be conſidered by Sinners; and they muſt have, a realizing apprehenſion about the readineſs and willingneſs of the Glorious God to receive broken-hearted Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners into his favour for the ſake of Chriſt. <hi>If God ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things.</hi> If God hath broken the heart of his Son for us, will he not heal our hearts, upon our ſeeking to him? Thus we muſt conſider that our hearts may be rightly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Our eyes muſt be unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for all the bleſſings and benefits of broken hearts; if we will be accepted with God. We muſt look unto Chriſt for all the good that is beſtowed in, and with a broken heart. By the merit of his heart blood, muſt our hearts be broken for, and from our ſins, and healed when ſo broken; and the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039607_0051_10147E0607B94F68"/>
of our brokenneſs of heart with God, muſt be aſcribed unto him, whoſe heart was fore broken: For we may not expect to be accepted with God, meerly becauſe our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful herrts are broken, ſo as to be willing to he delivered and ſeparated from ſin: For if we have no intereſt in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we cannot by any means be admitted into the favour of God, nor accepted in his right, tho' our hearts were never ſo much broken; for we muſt conſtantly remember that, in 1 Pet 2.5. <hi>Spiritual Sacrifice acceptable to God, by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When we try to offer broken hearts for ſacrifices unto God, we muſt look for acceptance of them thro' Jeſus Chriſt. And when ever we deſire the mercy of a broken heart, or the mercies promiſed with ſuch an heart, we muſt behold our Lord Jeſus Chriſt purchaſing all for us; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God the Father is willing, for the ſake of his Son, by his Holy Spirit, to beſtow upon us all the good things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a broken heart, if we are but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive thoſe good things; and if we are made thus willing, we are obliged unto a broken-hearted Redeemer for that willingneſs. He hath purchaſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that willingneſs for us, and beſtowed it on us. Thus muſt there be an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the pardoning mercy of God in Chriſt, where there is the brokenneſs of heart that God will accept.</p>
               <p>Hereupon Examine then every Soul, and conſider, <hi>Have you a due regard unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in all your ſorrow for Sin? Do you look
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:039607_0052_10147E2D9EC32328"/>
for acceptance of your ſerious endeavours about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance on the account of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt! Or do you think to deſerve or obtain the Mercies of God, by your brokenneſs of Heart? Or do you think to prepare your ſelves for Union with Chriſt, by getting your Hearts more broken by your endeavours in your own ſtrength?</hi> Certainly if you have had no regard unto Jeſus Chriſt in your eſſays to get your Hearts broken, or if you have not eyed him, as the author and finiſher of this benefit, you have yet no right brokenneſs of Heart. If the blood of Chriſt hath not been applyed unto your Souls, by the holy Spirit of God bringing home the ſenſe of Gods love in Jeſus Chriſt to your Souls, and helping you to believe in Chriſt, you cannot be ſure that your Hearts have been rightly broken. But if our underſtandings have been ſo illuminated as to ſee the juſtice and ſtrictneſs of the holy law of the righteous God, and the odiouſneſt and the heinouſneſs of all ſin againſt that Law, and the dreadfulneſs, and the certainty of the puniſhment threatned by that Law, againſt all the breakers of that Law, without a full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to that law by a perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and if we have ſuch conviction upon our Conſciences, that the burden of Sin lies heavily upon our Souls, and our Souls are ſo diſtreſſed and afflicted with that burden, that we are ſo humbled, grieved and aſhamed, that we have ſinned, and willing to ſubmit unto any terms, that God ſhall preſcribe, that we may be delivered from Sin; and if we abhor all Sin, reſolve and purpoſe againſt it with all our Hearts, relying on Chriſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039607_0053_10147E08CF905830"/>
for ſtrength to avoid and conquer all Sin; and if we have a continual apprehenſion of the pardoning mercy of God, in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, with faith in his Blood, and are continually concerned for aſſurance of an Intereſt in that Mercy, on the account of Chriſt; and our Souls do more and more long for more full aſſurance of our Union and Communion with Chriſt, and our Souls are more and more ſwallowed up in love unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in Admiration of his Love to our Souls; and we aſcribe unto him the Glory of all the good that ever we enjoyed, or deſire to enjoy; and are continually ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying and contriving to ſhew our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto God for giving Chriſt unto us; and our thankfulneſs unto Chriſt, for what he hath been willing to do and bear for our good, and if we long for Heaven, becauſe there we ſhall be employed in glorifying of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for ever; Then we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the brokenneſs of Heart, that will appear acceptable with the glorious God thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw</hi> 1. Sin is pardoned and the Soul ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued unto God when the Heart is thus broken. Therefore is this brokenneſs of Heart accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God. We read in Iſaiah 1.18. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them that are willing and obedient, ſo have their Hearts broken, <hi>Tho' their Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as Snow; tho' they
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039607_0054_10147E2F421946F8"/>
be red as Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi> The meaning is, they ſhall be all Pardoned, and the Souls of the Sinners purifyed, as well as juſtifyed. Then the clamour of their Sins, will be Silenced, and they ſhall not hinder the courſe of the Mercies of God, unto their Souls. We find in Iſa. 59.2. It is declared to ſome, <hi>Your Iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, your Sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear.</hi> But if their Sins are pardoned, then Sinners may have acceſs to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt: And when the wall of ſeparation is made by Sin, between God and our Souls is removed, then will there be a free paſſage for mercy to our Souls. Then will God manifeſt unto our Souls, that he doth receive us into his favour and ſo our broken Hearts will appear not to be deſpiſed, but accepted with the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God is appeaſed unto Sinners, and well pleaſed with them for the ſake of Chriſt, when their Hearts be ſo broken.</hi> Their wills are brought into Gods will in brokenneſs of Heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will he not deſpiſe their broken Hearts, being reconciled unto their perſons. The great conteſt between God and Sinners, it is this, <hi>Who ſhall have their Will,</hi> God or Sinners? But when the Hearts of Sinners are duly broken, then they yield to God. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that he ſhould have his will. He hath attained his end upon them, and brought them to a ſubmiſſion to his pleaſure, and ſo he is attoned to them; Thence will God have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in broken Hearts, and make his abode in them, as in Iſa. 57.5. <hi>The high and lofty
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:039607_0055_10147E0B33834950"/>
one that Inhabiteth Eternity, dwelleth with him that is of a contrite and humble Spirit,</hi> and he will revive &amp; comfort them that are ſo. And he ſays in Iſa. 66. <hi>To this man will I look, that is of a contrite Spirit, and that trembleth at my Word.</hi> When the Heart of <hi>Ephraim</hi> was broken ſo as to bewail and bemoan his miſerable condition, then ſays the Lord in Jer. 31.20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, my bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy on him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> God being reconciled unto Sinners, will ſurely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their broken Hearts, and be well pleaſed with them</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The heart of God appears in a manner broken with compaſſion toward Miſerable Sinners, when their ſinful hearts do appear to be duly broken.</hi> But if His Heart be broken and opened with compaſſion toward Sinners, then be ſure, he will not deſpiſe their brokenneſs of Heart. We read in Judges 10.16. The People of God had grievouſly ſinned againſt the Lord, Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries came upon them for their Sins, they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Lord for deliverance from their miſeries, the Lord brought them to ſuch a brokenneſs of heart that they complyed with his will, Then it follows, <hi>The Soul of the Lord was grieved for the Miſery of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe things we may learn a little what means that brokenneſs of Heart which God will not deſpiſe, and <hi>That</hi> and <hi>Why</hi> ſuch bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs of Heart will be acceptable with God thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>USE 1. We might hence Learn, <hi>The

folly of all Sinners that harden their heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, that will not comply with his Will.</hi> They ſhall not, they cannot proſper; for none ever yet proſpered in hardening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt God. God evermore, overcomes all thoſe that harden themſelves againſt him. Remember <hi>Pharoah</hi>! If the Hearts of Sinners be not broken by the means of Grace in the time of his patience, they will certainly be dreadfully broken by the Wrath of God in the day of Vengeance. Would Sinners conſent to have their Hearts broken by the means that God hath appointed for the breaking of them, they would find that the Lord would take pleaſure in them; He delights in broken Hearts, but as long as poor Sinners do refuſe to have their Hearts broken, they find their bands are made ſtronger and ſtronger: The diſtreſſes of their Soul grow more and more terrible. Was it not ſo with <hi>David,</hi> in Pſal. 32.3. Where he ſays <hi>While I kept ſilent</hi> (from confeſſing of Sin to God:) <hi>my bones waxed old thro' my roaring all the day.</hi> But when his Heart was broken ſo, as to be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his Sin to God; Then he found relief in, releaſe from his trouble of Soul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould Sinners be willing to have their Hearts broken ſo as to be prepared for the ſenſe of the pardoning mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus.

We muſt not imagine to get our Hearts broken that we may come to Chriſt, but we muſt come to Chriſt for brokenneſs of Heart: We muſt look on him whoſe Heart hath been pierced and broken by our Sins, that our Heart may be broken for our Sins, and from our Sins. But,</p>

               <p>Poor Man, <hi>Be now adviſed, in the Name and Fear of the glorious and eternal God, to be now earneſtly concerned for ſuch a broken Heart as God will not deſpiſe,</hi>

deſpiſe you, in your preſent deplorable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; while we muſt all own our ſelves to be miſerable Sinners, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controleable Sovereignty of the Moſt High God, is to be acknowledged, in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that are made in our Circumſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your Caſe might have been my Caſe or the Caſe of any other perſon here, if the Sovereign Lord of all had ſo pleaſed.

Beſides all the other things that have been more generally Offered unto all, for their Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Improvement; there may two or three things be now Offered unto your more peculiar Conſideration; but the ſum of them is not unfit to be conſidered by all the Congregation.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Conſider the Sins, the great Sins, the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and many Sins, that you have been guilty of, in the ſight of the Glorious and Heart-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God; that your heart may be broken by the conſideration of theſe your Sins.</hi> Your ſins are, God knows what, and how many; you

know more than is poſſible for any of your Neighbours to know, tho' your Neighbours know enough, to affect all their hearts, if they were not exceeding hard, and ſome of them have ſeemed to be mightily affected with the conſideration of thoſe your ſins, which they have known. Then be ſure the conſideration of your ſins, that you know your ſelf to be guilty of in the ſight of God, ſhould break your own heart. You ought ſeriouſly and ſolemnly to conſider the ſins which your heart is privy to; all the ſins that your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can juſtly charge you with, and the ſins that you may juſtly believe in your own heart, have provoked the pure eyes of the Glorious God, to leave you unto the great Sins, for which you are Condemned to Dye before your time; the time, which you might in a courſe of nature have lived unto; and the time which you might have deſired to live unto. You are not to live unto that time, that you might now deſire, becauſe you have been wicked over-much. And be ſure, you ſhould conſider with heart-breaking diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, thoſe your ſins that have been more obſervable than others unto your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and you ſhould confeſs and bewail thoſe your ſins before the World as well as before the Lord, with bitter lamentations: <hi>Your forſaking of God, neglecting his Worſhip, and Prophaning the Lords-Day; and all your ſins of Speech, that you can call to mind.</hi> Theſe are doubtleſs among the evils, that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Heaven againſt you, ſo as to leave unto your great tranſgreſſions. But, <hi>Oh, how

great are theſe your Tranſgreſſion!</hi> The Sin of Murder, you know, is a Crying Sin. So the Lord told <hi>Cain, The voice of thy Brothers Blood cries to me from the Ground</hi> It is a Crime, not only againſt Chriſtian Charity, but alſo againſt common Humanity. They ſeem to lay aſide Humane Nature, that are guilty of the Crime. It is againſt the Law of man, as well as againſt the Law of God: All Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have any thing of Civility among them, do abhor the Crime. It is againſt the Natural Conſcience; thence it brings hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror upon the minds of them, that are guilty of it; unleſs they are amazingly ſtupify'd. The Heathens thought, <hi>A Murderer, Vengeance will not ſuffer him to live.</hi> The Crime defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Image of God, which Humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bear; and therefore God ſaid unto all the Children of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9.6. <hi>Whoſo ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed,</hi> [The Civil Magiſtrate ſhould take care, to puniſh the Murderer with Death] <hi>for in the Image of God made he man</hi> The Crime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files the Land, where it is committed; and the Land cannot be cleanſed without the death of the Murderer: And therefore is it commanded, in Prov. 28.17. <hi>A man that doth violence to the blood of any perſon, ſhall flee to the Pit, let no man ſtay him.</hi> There muſt be all convenient ſpeed in the Executien of the Murderer. Indeed, reaſonable time ſhould be allowed for preparation for Death; and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful perſons are willing ſuch time ſhould be allowed; but there can't be allowed very long time, ſo great is the ſin. Yea, by this

ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Humane Creatures do ſink themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the very Beaſts of the Earth; for the Beaſts of the Field will not ordinarily kill one another of their own kind. Yea, more ſad; by the Sin of Murder, the Children of men do dreadfully reſemble the Devils of Hell; the Fiends of darkneſs. Murderers may juſtly be called, <hi>the Children of the Devil.</hi> In <hi>Job.</hi> 8.44. <hi>He is called a Murderer:</hi> and Murderers, by imitation are his Children; Murder is his work. But if Murder be ſo great a ſin, then what may you think of your own ſin, that is more than a ſingle or a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Murder: <hi>For you have not only murdered others, but alſo endeavoured to murder your ſelf</hi>; Did I ſay, <hi>that you endeavoured to murder your ſelf?</hi> Alas! <hi>You have been guilty of ſelf-murder, not only in attempting to murder your ſelf,</hi> (cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your own Throat) <hi>but alſo you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and barbarouſly murdered your Wife, that by the Ordinance of God, was one with your ſelf; in Marriage made one fleſh with you; and you ſhould have loved her, as your ſelf, as your life</hi>; (yea more than you ſeemed to love your own life) <hi>and been willing to venture your own life, thouſands of times, had there been occaſion, for the preſervation of her life.</hi> But inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you have inhumanely put an end to her life, and to the life of her (and your) Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with dreadful ſtroaks, and with cruel ſtabs; and have thereby given occaſion for all their Relations, and all your Relations, to have their hearts filled and broken with bitter ſorrows all their days. Don't this break your heart! But beſides this, <hi>You have
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:039607_0062_10147E3B505C4F08"/>
occaſioned Confuſion and Conſternation throughout the whole Town</hi> Yea, filled the whole Land with amazement, with aſtoniſhment. <hi>You have defiled the Land with Blood, and it cannot be cleanſed from its defilement, without your Death. You muſt be made a Sacrifice unto Juſtice, or God would be angry at the Land.</hi> So great are your Sins. Will not this break your heart? The Law of God, in Numb. 35.16. was, <hi>That if a man ſhould ſmite any perſon with an inſtrument of Iron, (ſo that he Dye) he is a Murderer and the Murderer ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi> But it ſeems, that you have uſed two Inſtruments of Iron (a Pen-knife and an Ax) for the deſtruction of two perſons, whom you ſhould have loved as your life, and been willing to have expoſed your own life, to have preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either of theirs. <hi>But you have deſtroyed them, without giving them any time to make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Eternity, into which you have hurried them after a dreadful manner.</hi> If it were true, that you ſaw not what you did, after the firſt mortal blows, it would be no wonder. For what Eyes, unleſs the Eyes of Dragons or Tygers could look on, to ſee ſuch Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! ſuch Barbarity! ſuch Inhumanity! ſuch Deviliſm! Oh, Conſider ſuch things, to break your heart; and mourn for that your heart hath been ſo hard; no more broken for your ſin, than it hath been ever ſince your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, before your Condemnation, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it hath been ſince the Sentence of Death was paſſed upon you. <hi>Oh, that you may not appear ſo without the fear of God, while you are under Condemnation, as to have your heart
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:039607_0063_10147E156DD732F0"/>
unbroken for your deteſtable Abominations!</hi> But, Oh! Try to ſet your Sins in Order before your Eyes. Conſider them with their mighty aggravations. And forget not Original Sin; be able to ſay truly with him, in Pſal. 51.3. <hi>I acknowledge my tranſgreſſion, my ſin is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> This may be one means to break your own heart; and be ſure, if your ſins are before your face, and you mourn for them with bitterneſs of Soul, and brokenneſs of heart, <hi>looking unto the Blood of Jeſus for the cleanſing of them:</hi> This will be a deſirable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that God will caſt them behind his back, and forgive and forget them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them no more. Will not theſe things break your heart? Then,</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Conſider the woes, the ſad woes, the grievous and many woes, that you are expoſed unto, by reaſon of your Sins, that your Heart may be broken for your Sins, that have deſerved theſe woes.</hi> Oh, conſider what woes are already come, and what woes you may ſtill plainly ſee certainly coming! The diſtreſs on your Body, tho' you may ſometimes have endured grievous pains, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while; The diſgrace on your name, tho' you have brought grievous reproach thereupon; Theſe are nothing! nothing, to the other woes deſerved by ſin. You have brought grievous and laſting trouble upon your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: How muſt their Hearts be broken with diſtreſs, while they live? (The Infinitely, compaſſionate Lord, ſhew his tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions to every of them and ſupport their Souls under their heavy Sorrows) How muſt

they be diſtreſſed while they conſider what is come &amp; coming upon you! Will not this break your Heart! To think, your are bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grey hairs of your aged Father, with bitter Sorrow, to the Grave? To think, that you have brought miſery upon your poor Children, ſo that wicked People may ſay to them, <hi>Your Father Murdered your Mother and your Aunt</hi>; don't your Heart break to think, what diſgrace you have bro't on your name, and ſo trouble on the Souls of your Friends from Generation to Generation, after your Soul is gone into the other World?</p>
               <p>But Oh, what woes have you brought upon your own Soul! You have ſurrendered your Soul into the hands of Satan, the deſtroyer of Souls, after a dreadful manner. Satan hath fill'd your Heart &amp; hardened your Heart, and Oh! How dreadfully maintain'd a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of your Heart! Oh! that your ſinful Heart might be broken, that the Devil might no longer find any lodging, any ſhelter there! That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by his holy Spirit might take poſſeſſion of your broken Heart, ſo as to mend it and heal it, with his precious Blood! But, <hi>Oh! Still conſider what woes you have brought on your own Soul, in ſhortning your Time, in greatning your Guilt, and have now procured this woe to your Soul, that it muſt quickly be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of your Body into the Eternal World, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the awful judgment ſeat of God.</hi> And if you dye before your Heart be broken, there will ſtill be more terrible woes, than all theſe woes: All the Woes and Sorrows and Miſeries and Calamities of your whole Life, they will
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:039607_0065_10147E1791AA00D0"/>
be nothing at all, compared with the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful woes, that you muſt experience immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſeparation of your Soul from your Body; your Soul it muſt fall into the hands of the living God; whoſe angry Hands it is a fearful thing to fall into; and he will ſuffer it to fall into the hands, the jaws of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of Souls: The Fiends of darkneſs will ſeiz upon it. And it muſt be ſhut up in a dark, doleful, fiery, ſmoaky Priſon, till the Great Day of Judgment; then muſt your Soul be re-united with your Body, to appear before the tremendous Tribunal of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſight of the whole World of Angels and men. But if you are then found without an heart that hath been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for, and from Sin, before you dye; if Sin be then found fixed upon your Soul, and your heart then appear to have been fixed and hardened in ſin all your life, then you muſt hear a Sentence paſſed upon you, that will make the very Angels of Heaven to tremble: The Judge of the whole World will then ſay, <hi>Depart, under the Curſe of God into Everlaſting Fire, with the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Then there will be no room for a, <hi>Lord have mercy upon your Soul.</hi> But your Soul muſt, with your Body, go into Eternal Miſery.

Burnings without having your heart broken by ſuch thoughts!</hi> Does not your very Soul within you, begin to ſhake, and quake, and to quiver with horrour, upon the fore-thoughts of theſe terrible things? <hi>To lie for ever in Hell, where the Wrath of the Lord of Hoſts, like a ſtream of brimſtone, will be for ever kindling the Fire. Oh, dreadful, dreadful!</hi> A man, that I have underſtood was once upon this Iſland, but dyed in another place for Murder; before he dyed, he cried out to this purpoſe, <hi>I have been</hi>

You are already very miſerable; but Oh what is to follow, will be more dreadful, than all that is come! inexpreſſibly more dreadful, if your heart be not ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as to be prepared for the healing blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt before you Dye. <hi>Can your heart endure to be baniſhed from the Gracious Preſence of God for ever? and pun ſhed with an everlaſting deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and the Glory of his Power</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you refuſe to accept of Chriſt with a broken heart?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I have one thing more to offer to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, for the breaking of your heart; and if that thing will not break your heart, what will?</hi> No Conſideration will do it. But your heart will remain eternally under obduration, if the conſideration of that thing will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing toward the breaking of it. God will break you ſore in the place of Dragons, and cover you with more, than the ſhadow of Death for ever, if this conſideration make no impreſſion on you. The very ſubſtance of Death, of Eternal Death, in Everlaſting Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from all good; and in your endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of inconceivable vexation within your Soul for ever and ever, muſt be your portion; if the conſideration of what is now to be propoſed, will make no impreſſion upon you, to break your heart. But if your heart begin

to be already broken, the conſideration of what is now to be offered, will certainly be for yout advantage; it will promote the great work already begun. Prepare then to conſider, what is preſently to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: Lift up your Soul now to the Lord. Beg of him for the ſake of Chriſt, by his Grace, to help you unto ſuitable Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, upon what is now to be conſidered.</p>

Your heart muſt be ſo broken, as to pour forth, if not tears, yet ſighs and groans of unfeigned Repentance: You will repent of ſin, you can't but repent of ſin, confeſſing and bewailing your ſins before the Lord, if your heart be broken by the application of the Blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto your Soul. <hi>And you muſt be willing with heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But if your heart be not ſo broken before you Die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, within a few days, you muſt be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully broken for ever, between the Milſtones of the Indignation of the Almighty God. But if your heart be rightly broken, then will you be prepared for the Conſolations of God: And that you may by a right broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart be prepared for thoſe Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the People of God will be ready to offer their Supplications to the Lord. <hi>We muſt pray to the Glorious God, who hath made your heart, that he would take your heart into his own hands, that he would break it as it ſhould be broken, that it may be changed, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, framed, formed, new-made, and moulded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Holy Will.</hi> And we muſt pray, <hi>That all of our own ſinful hearts, may be ſuitably affected and broken, as they ſhould be, by our Conſideration of your deplorable Circumſtances.</hi> And therefore I muſt with a few words, now addreſs the reſt of the Congregation, that we may, by the Grace of Chriſt, be prepared to pour out our Supplications before the Lord for your Soul, and for our own Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O People of God, Conſider, what reaſon there is for all of us to have our ſinful Hearts broken this day, before the Lord.</hi> Never was there ſuch a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spectacle, in your Congregation, before this day, nor in your Colony, if there hath any thing like it, ever been in this Country.

Should it not break our Hearts to think that ever the righteous and holy God, ſhould be ſo provoked, as to ſuffer the Dragons of the bottomleſs pit, ſo far to break looſe among us, as they have done, to occaſion ſuch bloody, fiery deſolations,? We ought to conſider, <hi>what means the heat of this anger of the Lord?</hi> And all People <hi>ſhould ſearch and try their Souls, and their ways and turn to the Lord; and pray him to turn away from his fierce anger, that hath been burning againſt us.</hi> And let all of us conſider and examine our ſelves, and ſee how far we have our ſelves had an hand in pulling down the anger of God that hath been pouring down among us. If any one perſon here ſhould ſay, <hi>I am ſure that I have had no hand in pulling down the anger of God</hi>; it might be juſtly feared that perſon have been guilty, of ſome great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that can be ſo inſenſible, ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, ſo unconcerned, ſo hard hearted. We muſt all remember and realize unto our ſelves that we are all of us miſerable Sinners, born Sinners, with hearts full of Sin, have lived ſinfully, fill'd our lives with Sin. Who of us all can ſay, <hi>I have made my Heart clean? I am Pure from my Sin?</hi> We are all by Nature Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath: As vile as the vileſt. They that by the grace of God in Chirſt have been kept cleareſt, and fartheſt, and moſt free from outragious wickedneſs, yet have cauſe to mourn before that Lord, and to beg that he would cleanſe our ſelves from ſecret faults, that are before his face; and the ſin of our Heart that is in the light of his countenance. And who can ſay, <hi>how far God may remember

againſt us our common Sins, that are too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamented?</hi> How many People think well of themſelves and would have others think ſo of them too, becauſe they are not guilty, as they pretend, of any more than the common Sins of the times, not conſidering that God may, for the puniſhment of common Sins, leave Sinners unto uncommon Sins, that they may be hung up in Irons for the warning or ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, to take heed of common Sins? But if we were never ſo clear from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sins of the times, yet this would not aſſure us, that we have no hand in pulling down the anger of God. There was an holy miniſter of God, as faithful in the diſcharge of his Duty, for ought we know, as ever any Miniſter had been; but when that Faithful Miniſter of God beheld the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty of Heaven, appearing in his Holineſs, going to pour out his Wrath upon a ſnful People, for their great wickedneſs, he cryed out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am a Man of unclean Lips, and I dwell among a People of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Lips.</hi> It ſeems that he feared, he had not always maintained that faihfulneſs, that ſhould have been maintained, in teſtifying againſt the Sins that provoked the Wrath of Heaven againſt a ſinful People. But, beſure, all of us may fear, that God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting his diſpleaſure againſt every one of us, in what he hath lately in his Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, permitted, among us. We have no reaſon to ſay, it is, becauſe that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath been, a greater Sinner than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Neighbours, and therefore hath
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:039607_0076_10147E4D6036EAF0"/>
God left ſuch a perſon to be guilty of Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sins. But we ſhould rather ſay, <hi>let all of us repent of our own Sins, that we may not provoke the Lord, to leave us alſo unto deſtructive Iniquity. All People ſhould hear &amp; fear that they may no more do any ſuch wickedneſs.</hi> Other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations in the Town, may have reaſon to conſider how far they are concerned, in minding the diſpenſations of God. But be ſure, now God hath, in his holy Providence, brought this terrible Spectacle into our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; certainly it becomes all of us, to conſider and examine our ſelves, and be very humble before God, for our own Sins, and very thankful to God, that we have been ſo far preſerved by the reſtraints of God, from deſtroying our ſelves, or being deſtroyed by others, and be very careful to take heed about all our ways, that we may not provoke the Lord to leave us unto our own Luſts, or unto the Temptations of Satan. We ſhould fall if we were not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. Provoke not the Lord to withdraw his upholding Grace. Make ſure of a change of Heart and of a real Union with Chriſt, and of Pardon for all Sins paſt; walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and cloſely with God, rely on Chriſt for Help, to do ſo. <hi>Be in the Fear of the Lord all the day long.</hi> Shun all occaſions of Sin, all tendencies to Sin. Be much in Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Lord. And if God hath made us, by his Grace in Chriſt, ready and willing to pour out our Supplications before him, for the bleſſings and benefits of broken Hearts, for our ſelves and others, it is an
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:039607_0077_10147E256A25F290"/>
hopeful token, that he hath begun to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, and will go on to beſtow thoſe good things upon us: <hi>For the Lord hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Souls of them that are ſeeking of him; He will fulfil the deſires of them that Fear him; He hath not ſaid to the Seed of Jacob, ſeek ye me in vain.</hi> If God encline our Hearts to ask for good things, there is room for us to hope that he hath prepared his Ear to hear us. If ſincere Prayers break out of our Hearts for more brokenneſs of Heart, then do our Hearts begin to be rightly broken. Then may we conſider for our everlaſting encouragement, thoſe good and ſweet words in Pſal. 34.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them, that are of a broken Heart, and ſaveth the Contrite of Spirit.</hi>
