            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>MY EVER HONOURED FELLOW-CITIZENS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not without the moſt humiliating conviction of my want of ability that I now appear before you: But the ſenſe I have of the obligation I am under to obey the calls of my country at all times, together with an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating recollection of your indulgence exhibited upon ſo many occaſions, has induced me once more, undeſerving as I am, to throw myſelf upon that candor which looks with kindneſs on the feebleſt efforts of an honeſt mind.</p>
            <p>YOU will not now expect the elegance, he learning, the fire, the enrapturing ſtrains of eloquence which charmed you when a LOVELL, a CHURCH, or a HANCOCK ſpake; but you will permit me to ſay that with a ſincerity, equal to their's, I mourn over my bleeding country: With them I weep at
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014608_0005_0F943431DBFA5E68"/>
her diſtreſs, and with them deeply reſent the many injuries ſhe has received from the hands of cruel and unreaſonable men.</p>
            <p>THAT perſonal freedom is the natural right of every man; and that property or an excluſive right to diſpoſe of what he has honeſtly acquired by his own labor, neceſſarily ariſes therefrom, are truths which common ſenſe has placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of contradiction. And no man or body of men can; without being guilty of flagrant injuſtice, claim a right to diſpoſe of the perſons or acquiſitions of any other man, or body of men, unleſs it can be proved that ſuch a right has ariſen from ſome compact between the parties in which it has been explicitly and freely granted.</p>
            <p>IF I may be indulged in taking a retroſpective view of the firſt ſettlement of our country, it will be eaſy to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with what degree of juſtice the late parliament of Great Britain have aſſumed the power of giving away <hi>that property</hi> which the Americans have earned by their labor.</p>
            <p>OUR fathers, having nobly reſolved never to wear the yoke of deſpotiſm, and ſeeing the European world, at that time, thro' indolence and cowardice, falling a prey to tyranny; bravely threw themſelves upon the boſom of the ocean; determined to find a place in which they might enjoy their freedom, or periſh in the glorious attempt. Approving Heaven beheld the favourite ark dancing upon the waves, and graciouſly

preſerved it until the choſen families were brought in ſafety to theſe weſtern regions. They found the land ſwarming with ſavages, who threatned death with every kind of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But ſavages, and death with torture, were far leſs ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible than ſlavery:—Nothing was ſo much the object of their abhorence as a tyrant's power:—They knew that it was more ſafe to dwell with man in his moſt unpoliſhed ſtate than in a country where arbitrary power prevails. Even <hi>anarchy itſelf,</hi> that bugbear held up by the tools of power (though truly to be deprecated) is infinitely leſs dangerous to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind than <hi>arbitrary government. Anarchy</hi> can be but of ſhort duration; for when men are at liberty to purſue that courſe which is moſt conducive to their own happineſs, they will ſoon come into it, and from the rudeſt ſtate of nature, order and good government muſt ſoon ariſe. But <hi>tyranny,</hi> when once eſtabliſhed, entails its curſe on a nation to the lateſt period of time; unleſs ſome daring genius, inſpired by Heaven, ſhall unappalled by danger, bravely form and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the arduous deſign of reſtoring liberty and life to his enſlaved, murdered country.</p>
            <p>THE tools of power in every age have racked their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions to juſtify the FEW in ſporting with the happineſs of the MANY; and, having found their ſophiſtry too weak to hold mankind in bondage, have impiouſly dared to force <hi>religion,</hi> the daughter of the king of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to become a proſtitute in the ſervice of <hi>Hell.</hi> They taught that princes,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014608_0007_0F94343483A4E068"/>
honoured with the name of chriſtian, might bid defiance to the founder of their faith, might pillage pagan countries and deluge them with blood, only becauſe they boaſted themſelves to be the diſciples of that teacher who ſtrictly charged his followers to <hi>do to others as they would that others ſhould do unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS country, having been diſcovered by an Engliſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the year 1620, was (according to the ſyſtem which the blind ſuperſtition of thoſe times ſupported) deemed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the crown of England. Our anceſtors, when they reſolved to quit their native ſoil, obtained from King James a grant of certain lands in North-America. This they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably did to ſilence the cavils of their enemies, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted, but they deſpiſed the pretended right which he claimed thereto. Certain it is that he might, with equal propriety and juſtice, have made them a grant of the planet Jupiter. And their ſubſequent conduct plainly ſhews that they were too well acquainted with humanity and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of natural equity to ſuppoſe that the grant gave them any right to take poſſeſſion; they therefore entered into a treaty with the natives and bought from them the lands: Nor have I yet obtained any information that our anceſtors ever <hi>pleaded,</hi> or that the natives ever <hi>regarded</hi> the grant from the Engliſh crown: The buſineſs was tranſacted by the parties in the ſame independant manner that it would have been, had neither of them ever known or heard of the iſland of Great Britain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:014608_0008_0F943434C7888EF0"/>HAVING become the honeſt proprietors of the ſoil, they immediately applied themſelves to the cultivation of it; and they ſoon beheld the virgin earth teeming with richeſt fruits, a grateful recompence for their unwearied toil. The fields began to wave with ripening harveſts, and the late barren wilderneſs was ſeen to bloſſom like the roſe. The ſavage natives ſaw with wonder the delightful change, and quickly formed a ſcheme to obtain <hi>that</hi> by fraud or force, <hi>which</hi> nature meant as the reward of induſtry alone. But the illuſtrious emigrants ſoon convinced the rude invaders that they were not leſs ready to take the field for battle than for labor; and the inſidious foe was driven from their borders as often as he ventured to diſturb them. The crown of England looked with indifference on the conteſt; our anceſtors were left alone to combat with the natives.— Nor is there any reaſon to believe, that it ever was intended by the one party, or expected by the other, that the <hi>grantor</hi> ſhould defend and maintain the <hi>grantees</hi> in the peaceable poſſeſſion of the lands named in the patents. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly from the hiſtory of thoſe times that neither the Prince nor the people of England thought themſelves much intereſted in the matter. They had not then any idea of a thouſandth part of thoſe advantages which they ſince <hi>have</hi> and we are moſt heartily willing they ſhould <hi>ſtill continue</hi> to reap from us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014608_0009_0F943435777C6438"/>BUT <hi>when</hi> at an infinite expence of toil and blood, this widely extended continent had been cultivated and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>When</hi> the hardy adventurers juſtly expected that they and their deſcendants ſhould peaceably have enjoyed the harveſt of thoſe fields which they had ſown, and the fruit of thoſe vineyards which they had planted; this country was <hi>then</hi> thought worthy the attention of the Britiſh miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and the only juſtifiable and only ſucceſsful means of rendering the colonies ſerviceable to Britain were adopted. By an intercourſe of friendly offices, the two countries became ſo united in affection, that they thought not of any diſtinct or ſeperate intereſts, they found both countries flouriſhing and happy. Britain ſaw her commerce extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and her wealth increaſed; her lands raiſed to an immenſe value, her fleets riding triumphant on the ocean, the terror of her arms ſpreading to every quarter of the globe. The coloniſt found himſelf free, and thought himſelf ſecure: He dwelt <hi>under his own vine and under his own figtree and had none to make him afraid</hi>: He knew indeed that by purchaſing the manufactures of Great Britain he contributed to its greatneſs: He knew that all the wealth that his labour produced centered in Great Britain: But <hi>that</hi> far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing his envy filled him with the higheſt pleaſure; <hi>that thought</hi> ſupported him in all his toils. When the buſineſs of the day was paſt, he ſolaced himſelf with the <hi>contemplation</hi> or perhaps entertained his liſtening family with the <hi>recital</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:014608_0010_0F9434363578A4F8"/>
of ſome great, ſome glorious tranſaction which ſhines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the hiſtory of Britain: Or perhaps his elevated fancy led him to foretell, with a kind of enthuſiaſtic confidence, the glory, power and duration of an empire which ſhould extend from one end of the earth to the other: He ſaw, or thought he ſaw, the Britiſh nation riſen to a pitch of grandeur which caſt a veil over the Roman glory, and, raviſhed with the praeview, boaſted a race of Britiſh Kings, whoſe names ſhould eccho through thoſe realms where Cyrus, Alexander, and the Caeſars were unknown; <hi>Princes</hi> for whom millions of grateful ſubjects redeemed from ſlavery and pagan ignorance, ſhould with thankful tongues offer up their prayers and praiſes to that tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly great and beneficent being <hi>by whom Kings reign and Princes decree juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE pleaſing connections might have continued; theſe delightſome proſpects might have been every day extended; and even the reveries of the moſt warm imagination might have been realized; but unhappily for us, unhappily for Britain, the madneſs of an avaricious miniſter of ſtate has drawn a ſable curtain over the charming ſcene, and in its ſtead has brought upon the ſtage, diſcord, envy, hatred and revenge, with civil war cloſe in their rear.</p>

property of the King's ſubjects in America to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in Britain. The claim of the Britiſh parliament to tax the colonies can never be ſupported but by ſuch a TRANSFER; for the right of the houſe of commons of Great Britain to originate any tax or to grant money is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther derived from their being elected by the people of Great Britain to act for them, and the people of Great Britain can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confer on their <hi>repreſentatives</hi> a right to give or grant any thing which <hi>they themſelves</hi> have not a right to give or grant <hi>perſonally.</hi> Therefore it follows that if the members choſen by the people of Great Britain to repreſent them in parliament have by virtue of their being ſo choſen, any right to give or grant American property, or to lay any tax upon the lands or perſons of the coloniſts, it is becauſe the lands and people in the colonies are bona fide, owned by, and juſtly belong to the people of Great Britain. But (as has been before obſerved) every man has a natural right to perſonal freedom, conſequently a right to enjoy what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by his own labor. And as it is evident that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in this country has been acquired by our own labor, it is the duty of the people of Great Britain to produce ſome compact in which we have explicitly given up to them a right to diſpoſe of our <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>property.</hi> Until this is done every attempt of their's, or of thoſe whom they have deputed to act for them to give or grant any part of our property is directly repugnant to every principle of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014608_0012_0F943437B5BBE3D0"/>
reaſon and natural juſtice. But I may boldly ſay that ſuch a compact never exiſted, no, not even in imagination. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the repreſentatives of a nation, long famed for juſtice and the exerciſe of every noble virtue, have been prevailed on to adopt the fatal ſcheme; and although the dreadful conſequences of this wicked policy have already ſhaken the empire to its center; yet ſtill it is perſiſted in. Regardleſs of the voice of reaſon—deaf to the prayers and ſupplications—and unaffected with the flowing tears of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering millions, the Britiſh miniſtry ſtill hug the darling idol; and every rolling year affords freſh inſtances of the abſurd devotion with which they worſhip it. Alas! how has the folly, the diſtraction of the Britiſh counſels blaſted our ſwelling hopes and ſpread a gloom over this weſtern hemiſphere. The hearts of Britons and Americans, which lately felt the generous glow of mutual confidence and love, now burn with jealouſy and rage. Though but of yeſterday I recollect (deeply affected at the ill boding change) the happy hours that paſt whilſt Britain and America rejoiced in the proſperity and greatneſs of each other, (Heaven grant thoſe halcyon days may ſoon return.) But now the Briton too often looks on the American with an evious eye, taught to conſider his juſt plea for the enjoyment of his earnings as the effect of pride and ſtubborn oppoſition to the parent country. Whilſt the American beholds the Briton as the ruffian, ready <hi>firſt</hi> to take away his property, and <hi>next,</hi> what
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014608_0013_0F94343C142D1D88"/>
is dearer to every virtuous man, the liberty of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>WHEN the meaſures of adminiſtration had diſguſted the colonies to the higheſt degree, and the people of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had by artifice and falſhood been irritated againſt America, an army was ſent over to enforce ſubmiſſion to certain acts of the Britiſh parliament, which reaſon ſcorned to countenance, and which placemen and penſioners were found unable to ſupport.</p>
            <p>MARTIAL law and the government of a well regulated city are ſo entirely different, that it has always been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as improper to quarter troops in populous cities, as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſputes muſt neceſſarily ariſe between the citizen and the ſoldier, even if no previous animoſities ſubſiſt. And it is further certain from a conſideration of the nature of mankind, as well as from conſtant experience, that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armies always endanger the liberty of the ſubject. But when the people on the one part, conſidered the army as ſent to enſlave them, and the army on the other were taught to look on the people as in a ſtate of rebellion, it was but juſt to fear the moſt diſagreeable conſequences. Our fears, we have ſeen, were but too well grounded.</p>
            <p>THE many injuries offered to the town I paſs over in ſilence. I cannot now mark out the path which led to that unequaled ſcene of horror, the ſad remembrance of which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014608_0014_0F94343E13E00340"/>
takes the full poſſeſſion of my ſoul. The ſanguinary theatre again opens; itſelf to view. The baleful images of terror croud around me—and diſcontented ghoſts with hollow groans appear to ſolemnize the anniverſary of the FIFTH of MARCH.</p>
            <p>APPROACH we then the melancholy walk of death. Hither let me call the gay companion, here let him drop a farewel tear upon that body which ſo late he ſaw vigorous and warm with ſocial mirth—Hither let me lead the tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to weep over her beloved ſon—Come widowed mourner, here ſatiate thy grief; behold thy murdered huſband gaſping on the ground, and to complete the pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhow of wretchedneſs bring in each hand thy infant children to bewail their father's fate—Take heed, ye or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan babes, leſt whilſt your ſtreaming eyes are fixed upon the ghaſtly corpſe, <hi>your feet ſlide on the ſtones beſpattered with your father's brains.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">After Mr. GRAY had been ſhot through the body and had fallen dead on the ground— a bayonet was puſhed through his ſkull, part of the bone being broken his brains fell out upon the pavement.</note> Enough! This tragedy need not be heightened by an infant weltering in the blood of him that gave it birth. Nature reluctant ſhrinks already from the view, and the chilled blood rolls ſlowly backward to its fountain. We wildly ſtare about, and with amazement, aſk, who ſpread this ruin round us? What wretch has dared deface the image of his God? Has haughty France or cruel Spain ſent forth her myrmidons? Has the grim ſavage ruſhed again from the far diſtant wilderneſs? Or does ſome fiend, fierce from the depth of Hell, with all the rancour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014608_0015_0F94343F11D907E0"/>
malice which the apoſtate damned can feel, twang her deſtructive bow and hurl her deadly arrows at our breaſt? No. None of theſe—but, how aſtoniſhing! It is the hand of Britain that inflicts the wound. The arms of George our rightful King have been employed to ſhed that blood which freely would have flown at his command when juſtice or the honour of his crown had called his ſubjects to the field.</p>
            <p>BUT pity, grief, aſtoniſhment, with all the ſofter movements of the ſoul muſt now give way to ſtronger paſſions. Say, fellow-citizens, what dreadful thought now ſwells your heaving boſoms—You fly to arms—Sharp indignation flaſhes from each eye—Revenge gnaſhes her iron teeth— Death grins an hideous ſmile ſecure to drench his greedy jaws in human gore—Whilſt hovering furies darken all the air.</p>
            <p>BUT ſtop, my bold adventurous countrymen, ſtain not your weapons with the blood of Britons. Attend to reaſon's voice—Humanity puts in her claim—and ſues to be again admitted to her wonted ſeat, the boſom of the brave. Revenge is far beneath the noble mind. Many perhaps, compelled to rank among the vile aſſaſſins, do from their inmoſt ſouls, deteſt the barbarous action. The winged death, ſhot from your arms, may chance to pierce ſome breaſt that bleeds, already for your injured country.</p>
            <p>THE ſtorm ſubſides—a ſolemn pauſe enſues—You ſpare upon condition they depart. They go—they quit your ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014608_0016_0F94343F4339E5B0"/>
—they no more ſhall give offence.—Thus cloſes the important drama.</p>
            <p>And could it have been conceived that we again ſhou'd have ſeen a Britiſh army in our land, ſent to inforce obedience to acts of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament deſtructive of our liberty. But the royal ear far diſtant from this weſtern world, has been aſſaulted by the tongue of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and villains, traiterous alike to king and country, have prevail'd upon a gracious prince to cloath his countenance with wrath, and to erect the hoſtile banner againſt a people ever affectionate and loyal to him and his illuſtrious predeceſſors of the houſe of Hanover. Our ſtreets are again filled with armed men: Our harbour is crouded with ſhips of war; but theſe cannot intimidate us; our liberty muſt be preſerved; it is far dearer than <hi>life,</hi> we hold it even dear as our <hi>allegiance;</hi> we muſt defend it againſt the attacks of <hi>friends</hi> as well as <hi>enemies</hi>; we cannot ſuffer even BRITONS to raviſh it from us.</p>
            <p>No longer could we reflect with generous pride on the heroic acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our American fore-fathers,—no longer boaſt our origin from that far famed iſland, whoſe warlike ſons have ſo often drawn their well-tried ſwords to ſave her from the ravages of tyranny; could we but for a moment entertain the thought of giving up our liberty. The man who meanly will ſubmit to wear a <hi>ſhackle,</hi> contemns the nobleſt gift of Heaven, and impiouſly affronts the God that made him free.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:014608_0017_0F9434414CB595F8"/>IT was a maxim of the Roman people, which eminently conduced to the greatneſs of that ſtate never to deſpair of the common-wealth. The maxim may prove as ſalutary to us now, as it did to them. Short ſighted mortals ſee not the numerous links of ſmall and great events which form the chain on which the fate of kings and nations is ſuſpended. Eaſe and proſperity, (tho' pleaſing for a day,) have often ſunk a people into effeminacy and ſloth. Hardſhips and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, (tho' we forever ſtrive to ſhun them,) have frequently called forth ſuch virtues, as have commanded the applauſe and reverence of an admiring world. Our country loudly calls you to be circumſpect, vigilant, active and brave. Perhaps, (all gracious Heaven avert it) perhaps, the power of Britain, a nation great in war, by ſome malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant influence, may be employed to enſlave you. But let not even this diſcourage you. Her arms, 'tis true, have fill'd the world with terror: her troops have reap'd the laurels of the field: her fleets have rode triumphant on the ſea—And <hi>when</hi> or <hi>where</hi> did <hi>you,</hi> my Countrymen, depart inglorious from the field of fight?<note n="*" place="bottom">The Patience with which this People have borne the repeated Injuries which have been heap'd upon them, and their unwillingneſs to take any ſanguinary Meaſures, has very injudiciouſly been aſcribed to Cowardice, by Perſons both here and in Great-Britain. I moſt heartily wiſh that an Opinion ſo erroneous in itſelf, and ſo fatal in its conſequences, might be utterly removed before it be too late: And I think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>further</hi> neceſſary to convince every intelligent Man, that the Conduct of this People is owing to the <hi>tender Regard</hi> which they have for their Fellow Men, and an <hi>utter Abhorrence to the ſhedding of human Blood, than</hi> a little Attention to their general Temper and Diſpoſition, diſcovered when they cannot be ſuppoſed to be under any Apprehenſion of Danger to themſelves.—I will only mention the univerſal Deteſtation which they ſhew to every Act of Cruelty, by whom and upon whomſoever committed; the mild Spirit of their Laws; the very few Crimes to which capital Penalties are annexed; and the very great Backwardneſs which both Courts and Juries diſcover, in condemning Perſons charged with <hi>capital Crimes.</hi>—But if any ſhould think this Obſervation not to the Purpoſe, I readily appeal to thoſe Gentlemen of the Army who have been in the Camp, or in the Field, with the Americans.</note> 
               <hi>You</hi> too
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014608_0018_0F943441B3887588"/>
can ſhew the trophies of your <hi>forefather</hi>'s victories and your <hi>own</hi>; can name the fortreſſes and battles you have won; and many of you count the honourable ſcars of wounds received, whilſt ſighting for your king and country.</p>
            <p>WHERE juſtice is the ſtandard, Heaven is the warrior's ſhield<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But conſcious guilt unnerves the arm that lifts the ſword againſt the innocent. Britain united with theſe colonies, by commerce and affection—by intereſt and blood, may mock the threats of France and Spain: May be the ſeat of univerſal empire. But ſhould America either by <hi>force,</hi> or thoſe more dangerous engines, <hi>luxury</hi> and <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ever be brought into a ſtate of vaſſalage, Britain muſt loſe <hi>her</hi> freedom alſo. No longer ſhall ſhe ſit the <hi>empreſs</hi> of the ſea:— Her ſhips no more ſhall waft her thunders over the wide ocean:— The <hi>wreath</hi> ſhall wither on her temples:—Her weakened arm ſhall be unable to defend her coaſts: and ſhe at laſt muſt bow her vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able head to ſome proud foreigner's deſpotic rule.</p>
            <p>BUT if from paſt events we may venture to form a judgment of the future, we juſtly may expect that the devices of our enemies will but increaſe the triumphs of our country. I <hi>muſt</hi> indulge a hope that <hi>Britain</hi>'s liberty as well as <hi>ours,</hi> will eventually be preſerved by the virtue of America.</p>
            <p>THE attempt of the Britiſh parliament to raiſe a revenue from America, and our denial of their right to do it, have excited an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014608_0019_0F9434423683BBF8"/>
univerſal enquiry into the rights of mankind in general, and of Britiſh ſubjects in particular; the neceſſary reſult of which muſt be ſuch a liberality of ſentiment, and ſuch a jealouſy of thoſe in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as will, better than an adamantine wall, ſecure us againſt the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture approaches of deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>THE malice of the <hi>Boſton</hi> Port-Bill has been defeated in a very conſiderable degree, by giving <hi>you</hi> an opportunity of <hi>deſerving,</hi> and <hi>our brethren</hi> in this and our ſiſter-colonies an opportunity of <hi>beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> thoſe benefactions which have delighted your friends and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed your enemies, not only in America, but in Europe alſo. And what is more valuable ſtill, the ſympathetic feelings for a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in diſtreſs, and the grateful emotions excited in the breaſt of him who finds relief, muſt forever endear each to the other, and form thoſe indiſſoluble bonds of friendſhip and affection, on which the preſervation of our rights ſo evidently depend.</p>
            <p>THE mutilation of our charter has made every other colony jealous for its own; for <hi>this,</hi> if once ſubmitted to by us, would ſet on float the property and government of every Britiſh ſettlement upon the continent. If Charters are not deemed ſacred, how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably precarious is every thing founded upon them.</p>
            <p>EVEN the ſending troops to put theſe acts in execution is not without advantages to us. The exactneſs and beauty of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline inſpire our youth with ardor in the purſuit of military knowledge. Charles the <hi>Invicible,</hi> taught Peter the <hi>Great,</hi> the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014608_0020_0F943442F39C6700"/>
art of war. The battle of Pultowa convinced Charles of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency Peter had made.</p>
            <p>OUR Country is in danger, but not to be deſpaired of. Our enemies are numerous and powerful—but we have many friends, determine to BE FREE, and Heaven and Earth will aid the RESOLUTION. On <hi>you</hi> depend the fortunes of America. <hi>You</hi> are to decide the important queſtion, on which reſt the happineſs and liberty of millions yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. Act worthy of yourſelves. The faltering tongue of hoary age calls on you to ſupport your country. The liſping infant raiſes its ſuppliant hands, imploring defence againſt the monſter ſlavery. Your fathers look from their caeleſtial ſeats with ſmiling approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their ſons, who boldly ſtand forth in the cauſe of virtue; but ſternly frown upon the inhuman miſcreant, who, to ſecure the loaves and fiſhes to himſelf, would breed a ſerpent to deſtroy his children.</p>
            <p>BUT, pardon me, my fellow-citizens, I know you want not zeal Or fortitude. You will maintain your rights or periſh in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtruggle. However difficult the combat, you never will decline it when freedom is the prize. An independence on Great-Britain is not our aim. No, our wiſh is, that Britain and the Colonies may like the oak and ivy, grow and increaſe in ſtrength together. But whilſt the infatuated plan of making one part of the empire ſlaves to the other, is perſiſted in; the intereſt and ſafety of <hi>Britain,</hi> as well as the <hi>Colonies,</hi> require that the wiſe meaſures recommended by the honourable, the continental Congreſs, be ſteadily purſued; whereby
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014608_0021_0F943443B353A218"/>
the unnatural conteſt between a parent honoured, and a child beloved, may probably be brought to ſuch an iſſue, as that the peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of both, may be eſtabliſhed upon a laſting baſis. But if theſe pacific meaſures are ineffectual, and it appears that the only way to ſafety is, thro' fields of blood, I know you will not turn your faces from your foes; but will undauntedly preſs forward, until tyranny is trodden under foot, and you have fixed your adored goddeſs LIBERTY, faſt by a BRUNSWICK's ſide, on the American Throne.</p>
            <p>YOU <hi>then,</hi> who nobly have eſpouſed your Country's cauſe, who generouſly have ſacrificed wealth and caſe—<hi>who</hi> have deſpiſed the pomp and ſhew of tinſel'd greatneſs—refuſed the ſummons to the feſtive board, been deaf to the alluring calls of luxury and mirth, <hi>who</hi> have forſaken the downy pillow, to keep your vigils by the midnight lamp, for the ſalvation of your invaded country, that you might break the fowler's ſnare, and diſappoint the vulture of his prey, <hi>you</hi> then will reap that harveſt of renown which you ſo juſtly have deſerved. Your country ſhall pay her grateful tribute of applauſe. Even the children of your moſt inveterate enemies, aſhamed to tell from whom they ſprang, while they in ſecret curſe their ſtupid, cruel parents, ſhall join the general voice of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to thoſe who broke the ſetters which their father's forg'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:014608_0022_0F9434447A030B30"/>HAVING redeemed your Country, and ſecured the bleſſing to future generations, <hi>who</hi> fired by your example, ſhall emulate your virtues, and learn from <hi>you</hi> the heavenly art of making millions happy;—with heart-felt joy, with tranſports all your own, YOU CRY, the GLORIOUS WORK IS DONE.
