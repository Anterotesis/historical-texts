            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Mutual good Affection between Prince and People, engaging them to their reſpective Duties, and ſhewing itſelf in the Expreſſions of a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Safety and Comfort of each other, is always deſireable, and perculiarly ſo in perilous Times. 'Tis (if I miſtake not) exemplify'd in this hiſtorical Paſſage of ſacred Scripture; and may, on the preſent Occaſion, be ſeaſonably recommended therefrom.</p>
            <p>The great King <hi>David</hi> was Man of War, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently qualified, not only to ſit on the Throne, and judge his Pople, but alſo to march at the Head of Armies into the Field, and fight their Battles. And

by his martial Skill and Atchievements, as well as by his conſummate Policy, juſt and pious Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, his Reign was glorious to himſelf, and happy to his Subjects. It ſeems to be in the latter End of it, when he was weaken'd with Age, that we here find him at War with the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> in which he <hi>waxed ſaint. Iſhhi-henob,</hi> which was of the Sons of the Giant, perceiving that <hi>David</hi>'s Strength fail'd him, ſet upon him with greater Fury, and thought to have ſlain the King,
and ſo defeated the Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> the Son <hi>Zeruiah,</hi> ſuccoured him, and ſmote the <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> and killed him. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King's eſcaping ſo great a Danger, his Men reſolv'd in Council, and confirm'd it with an Oath, that he ſhould go no more out with them to Battle, ſhould never again ſo hazard his precious and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Life, as he had often done, for the Safety of his People; left by his Death the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be <hi>quenched.</hi>—Some uſeful and pertinent Inſtructions may be gather'd from this Text: All that I ſhall offer may be comprized in this general Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That People ſhould be concern'd for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good Ruler, who is their Light, and does for their Sakes incur great Difficulties and Hazards.</p>
            <p>The Character and Work of a good Ruler, and the Duty of an obliged People, will come under Conſideration in this Diſcourse.</p>
            <p>Prop. I. <hi>That a good Ruler is the Light of his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:005602_0006_1026A91C4A093E90"/>So the Men of <hi>David</hi> juſtly thought, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouc'd him to be, <hi>the Light of</hi> Iſrael. And the Spirit of God ſpake by him in the ſame Stile of any other Man that ruleth as he ought. 2 Sam. 23. 3, 4. <hi>The God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid, the Rock of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſpake to me; He that ruleth over Men muſt be Juſt, ruling in the Fear of God. And be ſhall be as the Light the Morning, when the Sun riſeth, even a Morning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Clouds</hi>—.It is compared to the Light of the Sun, riſing clear after a darkſome and cold Night, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing all about, it's chearful Rays and kindly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences.</p>
            <p>Light is an Emblem of Authority. It is the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of Things viſible: Hath the Pre-eminence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, or Predominancy over them: Was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally created and deſigned to bear Sway in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural World. God made two great Lights <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. I. I6.</note>; the greater Light to rule the Day, and the leſſer Light to rule the Night: He made the Stars alſo, <note n="†" place="bottom">Job. 38. 33.</note> and ſet the Dominion of them in the Earth. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents his own ſupreme and univerſal governing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by Light: Takes it for his Robe of Royalty.—<hi>O Lord, thou art very great, thou art clothed with Honour and Majeſty. I'll be covereſt thy ſelf with Light, as with a Garment,</hi> Pſal. 104. I, 2. And his bleſſed Son, to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is given, wears the ſame Character: And is called in <hi>Balain</hi>'s Prophecy of him, a <hi>Star,</hi> and a <hi>Sceptre</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Numb. 24. 17.</note> And every Man, who, as God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and Chriſt's Repreſentative, is veſted with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Power, of any Degree in the Scale of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005602_0007_1026A9209A368688"/>
and exerciſes it to the good End for which it is delegated to him, is the Light of a People.</p>
            <p>He is ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">I. As he is their <hi>Guide.</hi> The Uſe and Benefit of Light is to make us ſee, to direct us in our Way. Of ſuch Advantage is a good Ruler unto his People, enlightning them with Knowledge of the Things, of their Peace, directing them in the Purſuit thereof, and pointing out to them the Way of their Duty and Safety. Job. 29. 25. <hi>I choſe out their Way, and fat Chief, and dwelt as King in the Army.</hi> By a wiſe and underſtanding Heart, a penetrating Judgment, a provident deſcrying of Miſchiefs or Advantanges, which may acrue to, or be averted from the Public, by a careful Inſpection of the State and Manners of People, and ſtrict Obſervance of their varying Circumſtances: By a divine Sentence in his Lips, when his Mouth tranſgreſſeth not in Judgment; by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Rules of Juſtice and Equity for all Relations and Conditions of Men, and Kinds of Commerce, in humane Society; by reſolving of Doubts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of Controverſies, and exhibiting a bright Example of Piety and Virtue, a Ruler is the direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light of his People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A good Ruler is the <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and ſo the Light of his People. <hi>Truly Light is ſween, and a pleaſant Thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun.</hi> It cheers the Heart, by working on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as well as pleaſes the Eyes: Warms and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens univerſal Nature, all ſenſitive and vegetable Creatures: It is benign in its Influence, and produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005602_0008_1026A922F4567FA0"/>
of ſweet Fruits : And ſo doth aptly ſet forth what a good Ruler is to his People, their Joy and Comfort. <hi>When the Righteouſ are in Authority, the People rejoice. The King by Judgment ſtabliſheth the Land</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. 29. 2, 4.</note>: For then Juſtice is adminiſtred, Peace and good Order preſerved, the Conveniences of humane Life are ſafely enjoy'd; Vice is corrected, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue encouraged. Innumerable are the Benefits which People receive from a good Government. The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Fruits of it, the Fruits of Righteouſneſs and Peace, are more to be rejoiced in, than the precious Fruits brought forth by the Sun, and the precious Things put forth by Moon; and the Influences of it are ſweeter than the Influences of the Pleiades, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend far and wide. A good Ruler, ſeeking the Wealth of his People, and ſpeaking Peace to them, is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them, and is <hi>as he that comforteth the Mourners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A good Ruler is the Light, for he is the <hi>Glory</hi> of his People. Light and Glory are equivalent Terms. The Light is bright and gliſtering, and makes other Things conſpicuous and beautiful. A good Ruler is illuſtrious, bearing the Image of God's Authority, and ſhining with the Rays of his Majeſty: He puts on Righteouſneſs, and it cloaths him with Honour, and his Judgment is as a Robe of Light, and Diadem of Beauty. His Piety is a ſparkling Gem in his Crown, and his Glory is reflected on his People. They are dignified and beautified with it. He ſcattereth away all Evil with his Eyes: Whatever is the Reproach and Obſcurity of a People. He ſaveth them from
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005602_0009_1026A9261ED34028"/>
thoſe Things which would bring or keep them low. He procureth their Advancement, makes them high and honourable among the Nations; ſpreads a Luſtre upon them, and renders them conſpicuous and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous—is the Beauty of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Sam. I. I9.</note>. It is by a King's reigning in Righteouſneſs, and gloriouſly, that the Common-wealth is not over-clouded with Adverſity that the public State becomes ſerene, and the Face of Things becomes beautiful: "As when the Sun ſhineth brightly, there is a clear Day, and fair Weather over the World". In theſe Reſpects is a good Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler the Light of his People.</p>
            <p>Prop. II. <hi>That a good Ruler, for the Sake of his People, incurreth many Difficulties and Hazards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>David</hi> was ſpirited for, and often perſonally enagaged in the Toils and Perils of War, and the <hi>Light of Iſrael</hi> was ſorely ſtruck at, and near being quench'd, by the Sword of the Gigantic <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> who thought to have ſlain him, when he waxed faint in Battle, which occaſion'd his Men to ſay to him, as in the Text. He uſually, with his Soldiers, jeoparded his own Life in the high Places of the Field, in the Cauſe of God and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He ſhewed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his affectionate Care of his People, and Zeal to defend them. Every good Ruler, like <hi>David,</hi> is ready, for his People's ſake, to engage in difficult and dangerous Enterprizes, when called thereto in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. The Safety of the People is the End of his Office, and his End in undertaking it; which that he may procure, he more or leſs expoſes their Light
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005602_0010_1026A9287AE47250"/>
to be quenched. His Work is arduous, in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Degree of his Authority: Cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with Eaſe, nor without Danger to himſelf. If he be not, for the Defence of his People, call'd to undergo the Fatigues and Perils of War, yet there are others, great and many, which he cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd from. His whole Buſineſs is a Warfare, in reſpect of painful Exerciſes; the Toils he muſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; the Wacthfulneſs and Diligence he muſt uſe; Enemies he muſt encounter, and Oppoſition he has to grapple with. His Office is laborious and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, accompanied with Varieties of Care and Fear Trouble and Temptation, and is hard to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged well or wiſely. He is God's Miniſter, <hi>attending continually upon this very Thing,</hi> Rom. I3. 6.</p>
            <p>Cloſe Application, Conſtancy and Patience are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the Accompliſhment of it. <hi>The Care of his People</hi> cometh on him daily; and is a Weight under which he is liable to ſink and ſometimes ready to complain, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> Numb. 11.11, 12. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou afflicted thy Servant? And wherefore have I not found Favour in thy Sight, that thou layeſt the Burden of all this People upon me? Have I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all this People? Have I begotten them, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay unto me, Carry them in thy Boſom (as a nurſing Father heareth the ſuckling Child.)</hi> More Burden proportionably muſt this needs be to the Fleſh and Mind, than the private Man finds that hath only a Family to provide for and govern; which yet would ſeem intollerable, were it not for natural Affection, the Strength of parental Love.</p>
            <p>Ignorant and inconſiderate muſt they be, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Man that doth the Work of a Ruler faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, hath an eaſy Taſk; and can live in Idleneſs,

It is apt, ſooner than bodily Labour, to waſte the Strength, to conſume the Spirits, and put out the Lamp of Life. He that is to be a Light unto a People, hath great Occaſion for it, to diſcern between Good and Bad, to ſearch out all Matters involv'd in Darkneſs and Perplexity; to frame Laws which may anſwer the good Intention of them; the Senſe of which may not eaſily be perverted, nor the Force evaded; to apply the general Rules of Juſtice to the great Variety of particular Caſes; to deviſe Means for the Redreſs of public Grievances, and the Prevention of impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſchiefs, and Emolument of the Republic; to manage with Diſcretion the Affairs of Governmen which are very important, and often embarraſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Men of <hi>David</hi> were ſo for his, which made them ſware unto him, ſaying, <hi>thou ſhalt go no more out with us to Battle, that thou quench not the Light of</hi> Iſrael. They had before manifeſted their Care of him, in refuſing to let him go with them againſt <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,</hi> alledging, <hi>that he was worth ten Thouſand of them</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Sam. 18.2, 3.</note>. How they were afterwards content that he ſhould go forth to War, we are not inform'd. There might be ſome ſpecial Reaſon for his being with them at this Time: Or remembring the old Enmity of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> perhaps he could not be perſwaded by them to ſtay at home: But when they ſaw how greatly endanger'd the <hi>Light of</hi> Iſrael was, they became more reſolute, and with the Solemnity of an Oath told him, that he ſhould go no more out with them to Battle. It was not prudent in him ſo to expoſe himſelf, in whoſe Safety the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic was ſo much intereſted; nor decent in them ſo peremptorily to declare againſt it; and neither the one, nor the other, is to be drawn into Precedent in ordinary Caſes; yet the affectionate Concern expreſs'd for each others Preſervation is exemplary. A King ſheweth a Regard to the Safety of his People, by going in Perſon to Battle. And they teſtify their Care of him, by their Unwillingneſs that he ſhould. Whether it be adviſeable, or not, in him, to put his Life to ſuch Hazard for their Sakes, or in them to oppoſe it; yet it is commendable in both to have
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005602_0014_1026A93149761A98"/>
ſuch a tender Regard for one another, as is manifeſted thereby, exerting it ſelf in all proper Ways of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Defence. What theſe Ways are on the People's Part, beſides this which we have in the Text an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of, may be ſhewn, after I have put them in Mind of the Obligations lying upon them, to ſeek the Preſervation of a good Ruler, that their Light be not quenched; totally, nor partially: To ſeek his Preſervation, as he is their Light—his Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only Life ard Being, but in his Splendor and Strength, Influence, Uſefulneſs and Glory.</p>
            <p>The firſt Commandment, with Promiſe, requires it. <hi>Honour thy Father. Honour the King</hi>; this we do not ſufficiently, according to the Obligation of this Precept, by giving him high Titles, and loud Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes, and the external Significations of Reverence, in unveiling and cringing to him; but by more ſubſtantial Demonſtrations of Reſpect, and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Concern to preſerve him, in his honourable State.</p>
            <p>The Relation which there is between Ruler and People implies this Duty of their's towards him. It is conſtituted by the wiſe and good Governour of all, not for the Safety and Benefit of the People only, without Conſideration of the Rulers; but to engage both in a mutual Aſſiſtance and Defence. It is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the natural Right which Men have to each other's Love and Care, and is deſigned for the better Exerciſe of the ſame. Were it not for this Relation they could not ſo well be each one his Brother's Keeper. By Virtue of it, the Wiſdom and Strength given Mankind, for the Preſervation of the Species, may be improv'd to far greater Advantages. As the whole natural Body is the better ſecured, by having
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005602_0015_1026A93425C41F10"/>
the Eyes in the Head, and the Strength in the Arms. The Ruler is to protect the People by his Wiſdom and Authority, and they him by their Eſtates and Strength. Juſtice demands this of them: Yea, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude conſtrains them to it. 'Tis plainly equitable that they ſhould be concern'd for his Safety, who is ſo much for theirs, as a good Ruler is. They claim it as their undoubted Right, to be defended by him in their Perſons, Names, Eſtates and Liberties; and he may claim it as his, to be aided and ſafe-guarded by them. This is the leaſt that in Equity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity they can render to him for the Benefits of his Protetion, and his generous Love toward them, in expoſing himſelf to many Difficulties and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for their Sakes. And their own Preſervation calls for it. 'Tis their Light will be quenched, if a good Ruler be not preſerv'd. "His Fall, like that of a tall Cedar, (to which the Scripture compares him <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai 2.13</note>) will ſhake the Earth, and diſcompoſe the State". Their Safety hath Dependance on his: And in his Peace, they have Peace. 'Tis their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for him to ſhine in Honour. All the Members rejoice if one, eſpecially the Head, be honoured; and by having the chiefeſt Beauty and Ornaments of the whole Body placed there. If a Prince flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in Wealth and Power, if he triumphs in Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Succeſs, it makes, as well as argues, a People to be conſiderable; renders them terrible to their Enemies ſecure from Injuries and Invaſions, &amp; great among the Nations. By his Proſperity they thrive; in his Adverſity they ſhare: If he be a ſhining Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Religion, his Influence on them is great, to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005602_0016_1026A9381442B8C8"/>
draw them to the Practice of it; as is alſo his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Heaven, to derive down Bleſſings upon them, and their Poſterity, even after ſuch a Light is ſeen no more in this World. <hi>David</hi>'s Piety was for a Memorial before God in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Time, and was a Defence to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againſt the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Hoſt, Iſai. 37.35. <hi>I will defend this City to ſave it, for mine own Sake, and for my Servant</hi> David's <hi>Sake.</hi> Since a People's Preſervation in a happy State, is ſo inſeperably connected with their Rulers, the Principle of Self-love urges them to ſeek it. To this they are obliged by all the Ties of Duty and Intereſt. And they ſhou'd expreſs their Concern for his Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Prayer to God for him. Prayer ſhould be made for him continually. To the almighty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, gracious Conduct and Bleſſing of the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Men, who giveth Salvation to Kings, hath their Hearts and Breath and Ways in his Hands, ſhould the Ruler of a People be devoutly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them. He is worſe than a heathen Prince that makes no Account, and they deny the Faith who don't make Conſcience of Prayer on his Behalf. The Perſian King charg'd his Officers to furniſh the Jewiſh Elders and Prieſts with Sacrifices Day by Day without fail, <hi>that</hi> (saith he <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezra 6.10.</note>) <hi>they may offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of ſweet Savour unto the God of Heaven, and pray for the Life of the King, and of his Sons. I exhort,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>that firſt of all Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and

peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty. For this is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By dutiful Behaviour toward him: Readily undertaking difficult Enterprizes, and hazarding their own Lives, when there is Occaſion, in Defence of his Perſon and Government—Cheerfully rendring the Tribute that is due for his Labour and Care, ſupplying him with Means to ſupport the Honour of his Station in the Eyes of Men, who are generally unable to diſcern the greateſt Excellency, under a poor Garb of worldly Cirmcumſtances, and apt to deſpiſe the higheſt Dignity, diveſted of ſplendid Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—Strictly obſerving all his lawful Commands being put in Mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates, and be ready to every good Work, enjoyned by them—Accepting always with all Thankfulneſs the worthy Deeds done by his Providence, not unreaſonably ſuſpecting his Deſigns, nor boldly taxing his Actions; not ſpeaking Evil of him, but commending his Vertues, and concealing his Infirmities; and yet not ſuffering Sin upon him, which may, at ſome Times, and in ſome Way, be fitly diſpenſed, without ſaying to a <hi>King,</hi> (in the Manner which <hi>Elihu</hi> Condemns<note n="†" place="bottom">Job. 34.18.</note>) <hi>Thou art wicked, and to Princes, Ye are Ungodly.</hi> When People are thus dutiful in their Carriage toward a Ruler, then are they his <hi>Strength</hi>

Branches of it which have been mentioned, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Civil Ruler more immediately, but in its largerſt Extent, and as comprizing all Duties, toward God, our Neighbour, and our Selves, muſt be ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiced by the People who would obtain the divine Protection and Bleſſing for their Ruler, and themſelves, that their Light be not quenched. His Safety, as well as their's according to the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which the Scripture makes of it, depends upon their Piety—And by their Wickedneſs they deſtroy him, as well as themſelves. When the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> aſked a King, and <hi>Soul</hi> was ſet over them, <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Only fear the Lord, and ſerve him in Truth with all your Heart, for conſider how great Things he hath done for you. But if ye ſhall ſtill do wickedly, ye ſhall be conſumed, both ye and your King</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. 12.24, 25.</note>. The Sin of a People often provokes a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God to leave the Ruler of them to be miſled by Temptations, and drawn away of his own Luſts, into Courſes which prove deſtructive both to them and him. Many Inſtances of this occur in ſacred Hiſtory. Thro' the Anger of the Lord it came to paſs in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> until he had caſt them out from his Preſence <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Kings 24.29.</note>, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And the Anger of the Lord was kindled againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> when good King <hi>Joſiah</hi> was ſlain in the Battle with <hi>Pharaoh-neeho</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Chron. 35.</note> which he, contrary to ſober Advice, engaged in. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake unadviſedly with his Lips, when the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> provoked his Spririt, and it went ill with him for their Sakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.32, 33.

               <p>This Diſcourſe may be apply'd both to Rulers and People.</p>

The high Character which his Men gave him, <hi>the Light of</hi> Iſrael: And the heroic Enterprize for the Safety of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in which he ſo extremely hazarded his Life, and ſo narrowly eſcaped Death, as made them ſware he ſhould go no more out with them to Battle, will they not aſpire to be the Light of their People, and undertake Difficulties and expoſe themſelves to Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for the public Good and Welfare; and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a reciprocal Concern of the People to preſerve them in a high, ſplendid and uſeful Condition of Life? God is a Sun and Shield.

Exalted, divinely glorious Character! What ſo worthy Object of Ambition, or humane Deſire, can be propoſed to the Men of Honour? Can they aim to riſe higher, to ſhine brighter in this World, who (as other Men) are formed out of the Duſt, are Children of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Brethren of Worms? This lofty mid glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Title is not given them to lift them up with Pride, but to admoniſh them of their Duty; and it no farther belongs to, or adorns them, than they, in correſpondent Properties and Acts, do make it good.</p>
               <p>That they may anſwer their Character they muſt be endued with the reſembling Qualities of Light in

the Charity and Greatneſs of Underſtanding, and Depth of Penetration, the Pureneſs of Deſign, the Benignity of Temper, the Warmth of a public Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Conſtancy and Activity of provident Care, Steadineſs of Proceeding, and in the moſt diffuſive Benevolence. They need be filled with the Spirit of Wiſdom and Counſel, as the People's Light, to ſhine upon their Ways; and daily to ſhed down on them the Beams of a gentle and fair Adminiſtration, making them glad and reſplendent: The guilding the Common-wealth, as the Sun-Beams do the Earth. Rulers ſhould be <hi>Light in the Lord</hi>; endued with heavenly Wiſdom, making their Faces to ſhine, and good Works appear before Men. So will they be the greater and more beneficial Light of the People; far more glorious in themſelves, and advantageous to others: This tranſforming them into nearer and more happy Reſemblance of the Father of Lights, even God, who is Light, and in whom there is no Darkneſs at all. It tranſfigures them in Manner; as Chriſt, their Lord and Maſter, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, was tranſfigur'd on Mount <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> ſo that his Face did ſhine as the Sun, and his Raiment was white as the Light <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 17.7.</note>.

               <p>Such Rulers Will be more affectionately concern'd for the People's Safety and Welfare; and in order there to be more diſpos'd, and better fitted, to do all that is incumbent on them, with Self-Denial, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience

To their Power (I bear Record) yea, and beyond their Power they were willing to contribute their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, Eſtates and Arms toward your ruling proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, to their Comfort and Joy, and your Enemies Terror and Confuſion.</p>

               <p>Our Heart's Deſire for your Excellency is, that by the Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs and Clemency of your Government, and the Luſtre of your good Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in Chriſt, you may continue to ſhine in your high Sphere, and in a long Courſe of unclouded Glory, attending your ſucceſsful Endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Good and Safety of this People; that ſo when you muſt ceaſe to be their Light, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this Hemiſphere, and ſetting (as to your Body) in the Grave, (which you are wiſely to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of—<hi>the Sun knoweth his going down)</hi> your Spirit may aſcend above the ſtarry Heavens, and be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Realms of everlaſting Light and Peace, with the Euge from the Mouth of your divine Maſter, <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servant, thou haſt been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over a few Things, I will make thee Ruler over many Things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi>
