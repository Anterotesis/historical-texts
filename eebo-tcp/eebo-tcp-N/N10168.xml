            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> MY friend, the laſt queſtion <note n="*" place="bottom">Colorum diverſitas, diverſas inter gentes ex climatum differentia praecipue oritur.</note> has ſuggeſted another; which, as it is acknowledged by all to be far from unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and, in the apprehenſions of many, by no means improper to be attentively conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this people at the preſent day; the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of this truly venerable, this learned and polite aſſembly will excuſe us in attempting, in a few words, to examine, <hi>Whether the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to which Africans are in this province, by the permiſſion of law, ſubjected, be agreable to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012917_0003_0F8E6E36D9A984E0"/>the law of nature?</hi> And ſince, fully perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the truth of thoſe principles, in which is founded the idea of natural equality, to the excluſion of a right in one individual of the human ſpecies to exerciſe any degree of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over another without his conſent, I am o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to appear in favor of the negative of the propoſition; and ſince, if I rightly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I have ſometimes heard you expreſs a very different ſentiment, if you are diſpoſed to join in the propoſal, I will firſt attend to what may be offered on your part in ſupport of it. And ſhall therefore only obſerve, that the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent conduct of mankind, reſpecting this matter, furniſhes us with reflections upon the preſent ſtate of human nature by no means the moſt agreable. To me, I confeſs, it is matter of painful aſtoniſhment, that in this enlightened age and land, where the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of natural and civil Liberty, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the natural rights of mankind are ſo generally underſtood, the caſe of theſe unhappy <hi>Africans</hi> ſhould gain no more attention;— that thoſe, who are ſo readily diſpoſed to urge the principles of natural equality in defence of their own Liberties, ſhould, with ſo little reluctance, continue to exert a power, by the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012917_0004_0F8E6E37A9C705C8"/>operation of which they are ſo flagrantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted. For what leſs can be ſaid of that exerciſe of power, whereby ſuch multitudes of our fellow-men, deſcendants, my friend from the ſame common parent with you and me, and between whom and us nature has made no diſtinction, ſave what ariſes from the ſtronger influence of the ſun in the climate whence they originated, are held to groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſupportable burden of the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſlavery, without one chearing beam to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh their deſponding ſouls; and upon whoſe dreary path not even the feebleſt ray of hope is permitted to dawn, and whoſe only proſpect of deliverance is—in death. If indeed the law protects their lives, (which is all that can be ſaid even here, and more—ſhame to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind! —more than can be ſaid in ſome of our ſiſter colonies <note n="¶" place="bottom">According to an act of Virginia (4 Anne, Ch. 49. ſect. 37. p. 227.) <q>After proclamation is iſſued againſt ſlaves that run away and lie out, it is <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for any perſon whatever, <hi>to kill and deſtroy ſuch ſlaves</hi> by ſuch ways and means as he, ſhe, or they ſhall think fit, <hi>without accuſation or impeachment of any crime for the ſame,</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c. And it is enacted in the ſucceeding clauſe (No. 38.) <q>That for every ſlave killed, in purſuance of this act, or put to death by law, the maſter or owner of ſuch ſlave, <hi>ſhall be paid by the public.</hi>
                  </q>
               </note>) the only favor theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012917_0005_0F8E6E3AABA0BF38"/>people receive, from ſuch protection, is a continuation of their miſery; the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a life, every moment of which is worſe than non-exiſtence. A favor this, no doubt, that in a very ſpecial manner demands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> Though conſcious, my friend, of my inability, the moſt advantageouſly to repreſent the arguments in favor of this propoſition, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when circumſcribed within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits the preſent occaſion will allow; yet clearly convinced of the propriety of attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering this queſtion, eſpecially at a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod when perſons of every denomination are ſo juſtly affected with a ſenſe of Liberty, I readily comply; rather hoping that if any preſent, are in doubt reſpecting this matter, they will take occaſion from hence, ſo fully to examine it, as to procure ſatisfaction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than expecting what ſhall be now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on my part will have ſo deſirable an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:012917_0006_0F8E6E3B70B859E0"/>
I am well aware of the difficulty of his taſk who attempts to defend a propoſition of this nature. An heart replete with benevolence and compaſſion will hardly admit reaſoning that involves principles ſeemingly incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the happineſs of <hi>any.</hi> Suffer me therefore to entreat you, that every tender ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, that even the feelings of humanity may be ſuſpended, while we calmly attend to the voice of reaſon, which is the voice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's alwiſe and benevolent Author.</p>
            <p>That Liberty to all is ſweet I freely own; but ſtill 'tis what, in a ſtate of ſociety at leaſt, all cannot equally enjoy, and what even in a <hi>free</hi> government can be enjoyed in the moſt perfect ſenſe by none. Such is the nature of ſociety, that it requires various degrees of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and ſubordination; and while the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal rule of right, <hi>the happineſs of the whole,</hi> allows greater degrees of Liberty to ſome, the ſame immutable law ſuffers it to be enjoyed only in leſs degrees by others. And though my friend, I can moſt cordially join with you in the benevolent wiſh, that it were poſſible that theſe Africans, who I am free with you to call my brethren, and to whom, it is confeſſed, the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012917_0007_0F8E6E3C58FAB2F8"/>principles of our civil conſtitution allow but a ſmall degree of liberty, might enjoy it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us; yet 'till I am convinced it might comport with the rule above mentioned, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them more I am in duty bound to appear an advocate for thoſe principles.</p>
            <p>Let it therefore be remembered, that the queſtion to be conſidered is, <hi>"Whether the ſlavery, to which Africans are in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, by the permiſſion of law, ſubjected, be agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the law of nature?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is, I preſume, ſcarcely neceſſary to obſerve to you, that by the law of nature is intended that law which is the meaſure of all our moral actions, and by which their fitneſs and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and conſequently their juſtice or injuſtice, are to be determined. In other words, that law to which whatever action is in it's nature fit and proper, juſt and right, is agreable, and to which every action of an oppoſite nature is diſagreable. This, then being intended by the law of nature, whether the juſtice of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſlavery,</hi> if found agreable to this law, is defenſible, will be needleſs to inquire. But it will be ſaid, through this definition of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012917_0008_0F8E6E3CDA8064B0"/>law of nature be admitted, we are ſtill to be informed what thoſe actions are, that are agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this law, and conſequently right. I anſwer, whatever action in it's nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant circumſtances being conſidered; tends to <hi>happineſs on the whole,</hi> is agreable to this law, and every action of a contrary tendency is hereunto diſagreable. And hence it will follow, that whatever practical princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſociety, (which is to be conſidered as the action of the community) hath this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, is to be reputed juſt, and approved and adopted, and thoſe of a contrary tendency conſequently diſapproved.</p>
            <p>To demonſtrate this, it will be neceſſary only to obſerve, that as nothing in nature can poſſibly be of the leaſt conſequence but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or miſery, ſo the difference in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the practical principles of any ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the production of theſe, is the only thing that can poſſibly render ſome eligible, fit and proper, rather than others; and was it not for this diſtinction, it muſt forever remain a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of perfect indifference, what practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were in any ſociety adopted. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012917_0009_0F8E6E3D99103AB0"/>ſtopping more fully to demonſtrate the truth of this principle, it having been recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed as well by the generality of ethic writers, as by the wiſdom of all good governments, I ſhall proceed to enquire, how far it will ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to the determination of the preſent queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, I ſhall enquire into the agreement of the law of nature with the idea of ſlavery <hi>in general,</hi> in oppoſition to that principle of natural equality, which is ſo zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contended for by the advocates for u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Liberty.</p>
            <p>By ſlavery <hi>in general</hi> I mean the involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubordination of the will of one to that of another; whereby, independent of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, the actions of the former are in all things to be directed by the will of the latter. Now if ſlavery <hi>in general,</hi> according to this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be agreable to the law of nature, the principle of natural equality muſt fall, and in order to determine the queſtion in diſpute, it will be neceſſary only to apply the general principle to the caſe of the <hi>African</hi> ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby it will be caſy to diſcern if there
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012917_0010_0F8E6E3E6FDFF370"/>is any thing in the nature of their particular caſe not agreable hereto.</p>
            <p>I am therefore now to ſhew, that ſlavery, as above defined, is not repugnant to the law of nature, and therefore that the principle of natural equality cannot be true.</p>
            <p>That right of authority is to be found in ſome being involving ſubordination in others, independent of all voluntary contract on the part of the ſubordinate, is, as far as I know, univerſally acknowledged. Such is the right of the Governor of the univerſe to govern and direct the conduct of all finite exiſtences, and ſuch is the right of parents to govern and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the conduct of their children. Now if it be found, that there is the ſame foundation for authority and ſubordination among dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent individuals of the human ſpecies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom no ſuch relations as thoſe above-mentioned do ſubſiſt, as there is for authority and ſubordination in thoſe caſes where it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be juſt, it will follow, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of rightful authority in ſome, involving degrees of ſubordination in others, muſt be admitted among them likewiſe. In other
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012917_0011_0F8E6E41A677D6E0"/>words, if the <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> authority of the Governor of the univerſe over the creation, and the <hi>limited</hi> authority of parents over their children, be found to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with equal ſtrength in favor of a right of ſome individuals among mankind to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any degrees of authority over others, the exerciſe of ſuch authority muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſt, i. e. agreable to the law of nature. And now to determine this queſtion, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inquire, in what the right of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in the caſes abovementioned, is founded: And here the anſwer is obvious, in <hi>the greateſt good of the whole.</hi> For ſince the Governor of the univerſe is poſſeſſed of power, wiſdom, and goodneſs in perfection of degree, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that the greateſt happineſs to the creation ſhould be the reſult of his exerciſe of the moſt abſolute ſovereignty. And though this right of abſolute authority in the Creator over his creatures be inſeparable from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Creator and creature, yet it is not founded ſimply in that relation, that is, in the idea of derived exiſtence; but in the natural imperfection and dependance of the creature, and the natural perfection of the Creator, and the reaſon of the neceſſarily abſolute ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the creature does not conſiſt merely in

Agreable to this is the foundation of the natural authority of parents over their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; it by no means conſiſting in the notion of <hi>derived exiſtence;</hi> but in the different quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of parents and children to execute this immutable law: For while parents ſo far excel their children in wiſdom, and from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection are diſpoſed to promote their happineſs, it will follow, that more happineſs will reſult to both, from the exerciſe of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in parents, and ſubordination in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than from the exerciſe of equal Liberty in each. And that this authority of parents over their children is derived from this ſource, and not from the natural relation ſubſiſting between them, conſidered merely as parents and offspring, is moreover evident beyond all contradiction from this conſideration, that whenever the parent is by any means diſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, in the reſpects before mentioned, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the conduct of his child, the ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the child ceaſes.</p>

If this, which I think none will deny, be a juſt repreſentation of the foundation in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of authority and ſubordination; in order to juſtify involuntary ſlavery <hi>in general,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the notion of <hi>natural</hi> equality, it is neceſſary only to inquire, whether among dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent individuals, between whom there is no ſuch natural relation as that of parent and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, there be not the ſame reaſon, ground, and foundation in nature for the exerciſe of authority in ſome, neceſſarily involving ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination in others, which there is in caſes where ſuch relation actually ſubſiſts. And concerning this, no one ſurely can remain a moment undetermined, who reflects with the leaſt degree of attention, upon the vaſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality obſervable between different individuals of the human ſpecies, in point of qualification for the proper direction of conduct. Now whether this inequality be conſidered as ariſing from difference in natural capacity, difference in the means of improvement, or in diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on properly to employ ſuch means; in a word, whether it ariſes from nature or education, or any other ſuppoſeable quarter, it matters not, while this is in fact the caſe, while ſome are actually found ſo far to excel others both in reſpect of wiſdom and benevolence, both in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012917_0014_0F8E6E439EB8C2E8"/>the knowledge of the principles of propriety, and a diſpoſition to practice ſuch principles, that the general end, happineſs, would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promoted by the exerciſe of authority in the former, though neceſſarily involving ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination in the latter, than by the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of equal Liberty in each, the exerciſe of ſuch authority muſt be right, and never the leſs ſo, though the individuals by ſuch an oeconomy ſubordinated, do not conſent. It is fit that children ſhould be ſubjected to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their parents, whether they conſent to ſuch ſubjection or not; this is put beyond all poſſibility of doubt by the expreſs declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wiſdom which cannot err; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the conſent of all ages in their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the principles of thoſe civil ſocieties which have warranted the exerciſe of ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Every law is applicable to all caſes within the ſame reaſon; and ſince it cannot be denied that the reaſon of authority and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination between parents and children, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applies to the ſupport of a diſtinction of the ſame kind among others not ſo related, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows inevitably, that a diſtinction in the latter caſe is equally juſtifiable with one in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; they are both ſupported by the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of natural law, and therefore muſt ſtand or fall together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:012917_0015_0F8E6E44580CEBE0"/>
I have introduced theſe obſervations upon the foundation of the authority of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the univerſe over the creation, and of parents over their children, for the ſake of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, rather than as neceſſary to ſupport the general idea of inequality: I ſay as neceſſary, for while there is ſo manifeſtly great an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in the capacities and diſpoſitions of mankind to direct their own as well as the conduct of others, to its only proper end, I think it demonſtrable, that the principle of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute equality could not be ſupported, even though we had no argument from fact by which it might be illuſtrated. And in truth, I think, before the principle of abſolute equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity can be maintained, it muſt be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that all mankind, in point of capacity and diſpoſition to conduct properly, are equal.</p>
            <p>It now remains only to apply theſe general principles to the particular caſe of <hi>Africans</hi> in this country, and ſee what degree of authority the people here are thereby warranted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe over them; and if it ſhall appear in fact, that they are not reduced by the law of this land to a degree of ſubordination beyond what the law of nature abovementioned, the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012917_0016_0F8E6E451B8AD7A0"/>happineſs of both, requires, it will follow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably, that the law by which they are thus ſubjected is juſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Before you proceed to the application you mention, permit me to make an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that perhaps may render ſuch applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unneceſſary. I think you have by no means ſupported the idea of ſlavery <hi>in general;</hi> but that your argument in favour of natural inequality, though ingeniouſly enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, is manifeſtly inconcluſive, and that the contrary, notwithſtanding all you have alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may ſtill be true. For though I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that in every ſociety the practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that in it's operation tends to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs of the whole is right, i. e. agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the law of nature, and that the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> authority of the Governor of the univerſe, and the <hi>limited</hi> authority of parents over their children is founded in the reaſon you alledge; and alſo admit, among different individuals, all thoſe different degrees of qualification for the proper direction of conduct for which you contend; yet that the natural right of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is hence excluded, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of natural equality conſequently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012917_0017_0F8E6E4629C3F888"/>is by no means acknowledged. The reaſon is obvious, that the principle for which you contend is in the nature of things utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impracticable; your concluſion therefore, from premiſes implying a falſe hypotheſis, cannot be admitted.</p>
            <p>The exerciſe of authority, only in caſes where ſuch exerciſe is productive of happineſs, is undoubtedly right: But ſuch is the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of things with regard to man, ſuch his nature, ſtate, and condition, as renders it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible that a principle, warranting the exerciſe of authority in any particular caſe, independent of the conſent of the ſubordinate, ſhould be correſpondent to this end. And for this good reaſon, that it is impoſſible for human wiſdom to diſtinguiſh the caſes where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſuch authority would be proper, from thoſe where it would not be ſo; and could this be effected, it would ſtill be utterly impoſſible for any <hi>practical principle</hi> of ſociety, for any human <hi>law</hi> to make the diſtinction. The ſame law which would warrant the exerciſe of authority in one caſe, muſt of neceſſity war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it in another; unleſs it could be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that ſome infallible judge could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012917_0018_0F8E6E4A595EE750"/>at all times, and in all places, and direct the operation of law in every particular caſe. And were even this poſſible, it might ſtill be doubted whether the principle of natural equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would be overthrown. Such are the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and imperfections, the paſſions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the beſt of men, and ſo deeply are all impreſſed with a ſenſe of Liberty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, that it may well be queſtioned, whether a law, warranting authority in thoſe caſes only where it would be moſt proper, were ſuch law poſſible, would operate more to the general happineſs, than a law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principle of natural equality: For tho' in that caſe, many would conduct leſs fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than they now do; yet the idea of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and dependence upon the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would be a perpetual, and not unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſource of miſery. But whatever might be the effect of ſuch a conſtitution, ſince that is confeſſedly impoſſible, it is evident beyond all contradiction, that the principle of natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality is infinitely better adapted to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral end, happineſs, than any other practical principle that can poſſibly be eſtabliſhed. Hence I think it is manifeſt, notwithſtanding the plauſible appearance of your reaſoning in theory, ſince it will not endure the true touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012917_0019_0F8E6E4B4AC97598"/>of practice, that ſlavery, which many to their coſt know to be a practical thing, is far from being ſupported thereby.</p>
            <p>Your notion of the ground and foundation of natural authority, in the examples you have adduced, is undoubtedly juſt, and conſent in thoſe caſes, is by no means neceſſary to ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, but, unfortunately for your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the caſes are far from being applicable to the point in hand: For as in one caſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of wiſdom and goodneſs excludes the poſſibility of error, and renders the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſubjection neceſſarily beſt; ſo the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of affection implanted by the Author of nature in the breaſt of the parent, inſpiring ſuch a tender concern for the welfare of his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, and ſo ſtrongly operative to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of kind offices towards him, together with the natural inability of the child, through weakneſs or inexperience, to be his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, may well warrant a general rule of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſubordination in the other. And when you have ſhewn me the man, or number of men, capable of infallibly directing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of others, the exerciſe of authority in them, ſhall not want my approbation. And
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012917_0020_0F8E6E4BD7E468C8"/>when you ſhall point out to me any claſſes of men, between whom there is ſuch a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive difference in point of ability for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per direction of conduct, as between parents and children, and the <hi>ſame</hi> diſpoſition in the ſuperior towards the inferior, that the Author of nature has implanted in the hearts of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents towards their children, I will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the exerciſe of a like degree of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority juſtifiable by the law of nature.</p>
            <p>But I am much at a loſs to conceive how your reaſoning in favor of ſlavery <hi>in general,</hi> were it ever ſo fully concluſive, could poſſibly juſtify us in thus forcibly ſubjugating the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans,</hi> between whom and us nature ſeems to have made no ſuch difference as that, upon which you ſuppoſe the notion of <hi>natural ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality</hi> to be founded: For I ſuppoſe you will hardly imagine the darkneſs of a man's ſkin incapacitates him for the direction of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and authoriſes his neighbours, who may have the good fortune of a complexion a ſhade or two lighter, to exerciſe authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. And if the important difference does not lay here, it ſeems not very eaſy to determine where it does; unleſs perchance, it be in the quality of their hair; and if the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012917_0021_0F8E6E4C991E4088"/>principle of ſubordination lies here, I would adviſe every perſon, whoſe hair is inclined to deviate from a right line, to be upon his guard. If indeed any ſhould alledge, that they are diſtinguiſhed by the flatneſs of their noſes, I can't but think this circumſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, for if a man is to be led and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the noſe, it may well be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether a noſe of a different figure would not be better adapted to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> My friend, I am no enemy to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but I think it rarely ſerves to illuſtrate a logical concluſion. I confeſs my argument, as you have repreſented it, appears ridiculous enough; but if you had deferred your reply till I had made an application of the principle to the point in hand, perhaps it had ſaved you this needleſs expence of wit. I have not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as a conſequence from my principles, that every degree of ſuperiority in point of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion would warrant to any individual of a community a right to exerciſe authority over his neighbour: I have only contended, that the notion of <hi>equality,</hi> in the ſtrict ſenſe, had no foundation <hi>in nature;</hi> but as happineſs is the only end of action, ſo ſuperiority in wiſdom,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012917_0022_0F8E6E4D5F84F458"/>goodneſs, &amp;c. is in the nature of things a proper foundation of authority. And as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has made differences among creatures in theſe reſpects; ſo it is fit and proper, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to nature's law, that different degrees of authority in point of direction of conduct ſhould be exerciſed by them; and that in ſome caſes, even among the human ſpecies, this difference is ſo important, as to render the exerciſe of authority juſtifiable, even without the conſent of the governed: For this I have produced an example from fact, in the caſe of parents and children. All this you have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly allowed. I now go on to ſay, as a conſequence from the ſame acknowledged principle, that whenever ſuch a connection of things takes place, that any number of men cannot, conſiſtently with the good of the whole, have a reſidence in any community but in a ſtate of involuntary ſubordination, and that their reſidence in ſuch community notwithſtanding ſuch ſubordination, be in fact beſt for the whole, ſuch ſubordination, though involuntary, is no violation of the law of nature; but on the contrary to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes correſpondent thereto. This is a true concluſion from premiſes incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012917_0023_0F8E6E4EC0C72860"/>principles univerſally acknowledged, and which you yourſelf have but now admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Subordination in this caſe comes fully within the reaſon of the ſubordination of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, reſts on preciſely the ſame foundation, and is therefore juſtifiable on preciſely the ſame principles. For whether the neceſſity of ſuch ſubordination ariſes from natural inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, or from any other quarter, it matters not, if this is in fact the caſe; if the intereſt of the whole does require it; let the cauſes or reaſons of ſuch requirement be what they may, ſuch ſubordination is equally juſtifiable as in any other caſe whatever; not only in the caſe of children, but even in the caſe of conſent; for the obligation to ſubmiſſion ariſing from conſent, is founded in the general obligation to fulfil contracts; which obligation is ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately founded in the good of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Now fully within this predicament lies, as I conceive, the particular caſe of <hi>Africans</hi> in this country. That it is only in a ſtate of limited ſubordination (I ſay <hi>limited,</hi> for it is to be remembered, that the authority of thoſe to whom they are ſubordinate, is reſtricted by the ſuperior authority of law, to which we are all ſubordinate, and which provides that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012917_0024_0F8E6E4F1445AE98"/>they, as well as others, ſhall be treated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the general principles of humanity) that theſe people can <hi>conſiſtently</hi> enjoy a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence among us is, I ſuppoſe, acknowledged by all. And whether it is not better for them to reſide here, notwithſtanding ſuch ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, even regard being had to <hi>their</hi> intereſt only, than in their native country, no one can doubt, at leaſt no one, who has a tolerably adequate conception of their miſery, and wretchedneſs there. Figure to yourſelf my friend, you are not unacquainted with <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> hiſtory, figure to yourſelf the delightful ſituation of a natural inhabitant of <hi>Africa.</hi> View him neceſſarily deſtitute of every mean of improvement in ſocial virtue, of every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the cultivation of thoſe principles of humanity, in which alone conſiſts the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the rational nature, and from which only ſource ſprings all that pleaſure, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of life, by which the human ſpecies is diſtinguiſhed from the other parts of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal creation. Conſider his ſituation as a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for an eternal exiſtence; view him as neceſſarily ignorant of every principle of that religion, through the happy influence of which alone the degenerate race of Adam can rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally form the moſt diſtant expectation of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012917_0025_0F8E6E529D66C778"/>felicity. View him moreover in a ſtate of the moſt abject ſlavery, a ſlavery of the worſt kind, a ſlavery of all others moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of human happineſs,—an entire ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the tyrannizing power of luſt and paſſion,—wholly devoted to the governing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of thoſe irregular propenſities, which are the genuine offspring of depraved nature, when unaſſiſted by philoſophy or religion. Behold him actually clothed in all that brutal ſtupidity, that ſavage barbarity which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſprings from ſuch a ſource. Add to this, his condition of perpetual inſecurity, ariſing from the ſtate of hoſtility and war that forever rages in thoſe inhoſpitable climes; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the treatment he is to expect, whom the fortune of war has ſubjected to the power of his enraged foe, whoſe natural cruelty is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually ſharpened, and whoſe deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is continually cheriſhed, by a ſenſe of his own danger. Reflect, I ſay, a moment upon the condition of a creature in human ſhape, (for in ſuch a ſtate of degradation one can hardly call him a man) the miſery, the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of whoſe ſituation is by theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but faintly repreſented; and compare it with the condition of a ſlave in this country; and then ſee if you can heſitate one moment
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012917_0026_0F8E6E5382C6E448"/>which of the two is moſt eligible. If perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture a doubt ſhould ariſe, if you will pleaſe to enquire, whether you would rather chooſe one, for whoſe proſperity you was tenderly concerned, ſhould be educated in <hi>Africa,</hi> with all the immunities of a native <hi>African,</hi> or in this country, though in that ſtate of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to which <hi>Africans</hi> are here ſubjected, I will venture to warrant you of every ſuch doubt a ſpeedy reſolution.</p>
            <p>Here then I reſt the argument, for upon this point the preſent queſtion muſt infallibly determine. Notwithſtanding all the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs attending ſubordination, and all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries to which an <hi>African</hi> is expoſed in his removal from his native country; while his condition here is ſo much more eligible than his condition there, his removal is to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed a favor: And the conſtitution of our government, whereby ſuch removal is counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and encouraged, is by no means to be eſteemed reprehenſible. It is in vain to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge here the want of conſent on his part. It is evident from the reaſoning above, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in order to ſubjection, is neceſſary in thoſe caſes only where the end of authority, the greateſt poſſible good, cannot be promoted
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012917_0027_0F8E6E541ABD5640"/>without it: But who I beſeech you, ever thought the conſent of a child, an ideot, or a madman neceſſary to his ſubordination? Every whit as immaterial is the conſent of theſe miſerable <hi>Africans,</hi> whoſe real character ſeems to be a compound of the three laſt mentioned. What can avail his conſent, who through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the means neceſſary to promote his happineſs, is rendered altogether incapable of chooſing for himſelf? And as the conſent of ſuch a being could by no means involve ſubordination in a caſe where it would be otherwiſe improper, ſo the want of it can be no bar in a caſe where it would not. In all ſuch caſes it is undoubtedly the duty of thoſe, whom providence has favored with the means of improvement in underſtanding, and the wiſdom reſulting from ſuch improvement, to make uſe of their diſcretion in directing the conduct of thoſe who want it.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that I have already dwelt too long upon this argument; you will however in this connexion, permit me to add, that were involuntary ſubjection, in all caſes, contrary to the law of nature, it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe, that the Governor of the univerſe, whoſe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is infinite, and whoſe will is eternally
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012917_0028_0F8E6E54D87FE190"/>and immutably coincident with, and <hi>when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us,</hi> the <hi>meaſure</hi> of, this law, ſhould ever have expreſsly tolerated it in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtance. I mention this in the preſent connexion, the rather becauſe I ſuppoſe the authority, the Iſraelites, when under a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment abſolutely theocratical, were permitted to exerciſe over ſtrangers, was founded in the ſame reaſon with the authority, for which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, viz: that it was better for them to reſide among a people, where they might have ſome opportunity for improvement in knowledge and virtue, though in a ſtate of ſubordination, than to remain amongſt the barbarous and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous nations, whence they originated.</p>
            <p>Were it neceſſary or expedient, it would be eaſy to ſhew, by compariſon, in a great variety of inſtances not mentioned, the ſuperiority of a ſlave in this country, in point of condition, to a natural inhabitant of <hi>Africa.</hi> And though it be too true, that theſe unhappy creatures are, in many particular caſes, cruelly treated, yet, while their importation is to them a redemption from a condition on the whole ſo much more miſerable, we muſt, as I ſaid before, juſtify the government in tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch importation; and with regard to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012917_0029_0F8E6E55AB79BAF0"/>the particular inſtances of abuſe, we can only ſay <hi>caveant qui ſunt conſcii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have omitted the right, ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be derived from purchaſe, becauſe I look upon the argument to be trifling. For though right of authority, if it be well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be poſſibly, in ſome caſes, transferable, yet it is well known, that all the authority any one of theſe miſerable creatures can pretend to over another, is founded merely in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of a brutal, ſavage war, conducted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leſt regard, on either ſide, to any principles of equity, juſtice, or national honor; and for the right of authority ſo founded I have no diſpoſition to contend. But I think there is much more in their argument who contend that, by the purchaſe of theſe vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims, their lives are preſerved, which would otherwiſe undoubtedly be ſacrificed to the cruelty of the captors. For though I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that to this is commonly replied, that the cuſtom of purchaſing captives is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſource of war; yet if we conſider that a people, ſo inhumanly ſavage as to diſpoſe of their neareſt relations for baubles, can never want matter of diſcord; and that, was it not for the advantages in this way made of them,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012917_0030_0F8E6E566F834CB0"/>the captives would generally periſh, we ſhall have no reaſon to doubt whether the cuſtom of purchaſing may in this way be conſidered as a favor.</p>
            <p>On the whole, ſince it is evident beyond all controverſy, that the removal of the <hi>Africans,</hi> from the ſtate of brutality, wretchedneſs, and miſery, in which they are at home to deeply involved, to this land of light, humanity, and chriſtian knowledge, is to them ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; however faulty any individuals may have been in point of unneceſſary cruelty, practiſed in this buſineſs; yet, whether the general ſtate of ſubordination here, which is a neceſſary conſequence of their removal, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the law of nature, can by no means longer remain a queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Notwithſtanding all you have ſo ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly alledged in ſupport of this queſtion, I am ſtill obliged to confeſs myſelf one of thoſe in whom your reaſoning has failed to produce conviction: And muſt be excuſed in ſaying that the juſtice of ſlavery <hi>generally</hi> underſtood, is ſtill, for aught I am able to diſcern, far from being ſupported.—It is true the Iſraelites
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012917_0031_0F8E6E57181E2220"/>when under a theocratical government were permitted, under certain circumſtances, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe authority over ſtrangers reſident among them. And this is adduced as an argument, infallibly concluſive in favor of ſlavery. But is it certain that this concluſion is not drawn a little too haſtily?</p>
            <p>The Governor of the univerſe has, in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inſtance, expreſsly tolerated ſlavery, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ever by him tolerated but what was agreeable to the law of nature. Therefore,—Slavery is lawful. The man muſt have a very extraordinary talent who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this concluſion from ſuch premiſes.— It is readily granted, that thus much may be juſtly inferred from them, viz. that ſuch a particular connexion of things <hi>once</hi> took place, as rendered ſlavery, under the <hi>expreſs permiſſion</hi> of the Governor of the univerſe, lawful. But will it follow from hence, that ſlavery is ever lawful <hi>without ſuch permiſſion?</hi> As well may we infer a right, by the law of nature, to put any who are unable to reſiſt our power, under harrows and axes of iron, and in a word, make the <hi>particular</hi> precept in any caſe, given the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> a meaſure, whereby to explain thoſe <hi>general</hi> laws of nature, which are to regulate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012917_0032_0F8E6E5B3186D158"/>of <hi>all mankind.</hi> It is undoubtedly true, that every expreſs declaration of the Governor of the univerſe is agreeable to, and juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planatory of, the law of nature, as far as ſuch declaration extends: And the conduct of any particular perſon, or people, which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch declaration is moſt certainly right; but it can never be certainly inferred from hence, that a like conduct in others, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame warrant, is agreeable to this law: For the imperfection of human wiſdom ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it forever uncertain, whether the caſes are in all reſpects ſimilar; and conſequently, it can never be <hi>certainly</hi> determined, that the ſame conduct will, in both caſes, have the ſame natural tendency to happineſs; and hence the ſame conduct, that in the former caſe was right, <hi>may</hi> in the latter, be wrong. But could even this be aſcertained, there would ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main an inſuperable difficulty in determining the actions of one people to be right, <hi>merely</hi> from an expreſs toleration of the ſame, or like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in another: And this ariſes <hi>ſolely</hi> from the <hi>want</hi> of ſuch toleration. If it be objected, that an action, in it's nature unfit, could not be tolerated; it may be anſwered, that the ſame action, <hi>when ſo expreſsly</hi> authoriſed, may be fit and proper, and in it's nature right,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012917_0033_0F8E6E5C3A24EB10"/>which <hi>without ſuch toleration,</hi> would not be ſo; and for this plain reaſon, that the ſame action, when by rightful authority permitted, may have on the whole a tendency to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which without ſuch permiſſion, would have an oppoſite tendency.</p>
            <p>If this reaſoning be juſt (the validity of which, I am happily too well acquainted with your knowledge of the principles of argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to doubt whether you will diſpute) how far the lawfulneſs of the practice of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry among the Iſraelites, when expreſsly tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Governor of the univerſe, will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a people in a like practice, to whom no ſuch toleration has ever been granted, is by no means difficult to diſcern. And before the principle of natural equality can be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, the tendency of ſlavery to the good of mankind, muſt, by arguments drawn from <hi>the nature and conſtitution of things,</hi> be made <hi>evidently</hi> to appear.</p>
            <p>I have no diſpoſition to contend for the ſupport of principles not founded in ſufficient reaſon; was I convinced, that the principle of natural equality, <hi>univerſally</hi> underſtood, was
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012917_0034_0F8E6E5CE8DB0BA0"/>not founded in the general good of mankind, notwithſtanding the conſent of philoſophers in all ages, I would readily give it up. And was I perſuaded, that the practice of enſlaving <hi>Africans,</hi> as tolerated in this province, was conſonant to this end. I ſhould no longer doubt of it's propriety: But unhappily for my apprehenſion this is far from being the caſe.</p>
            <p>Was it poſſible to conſider this caſe as ſtanding alone, independent of it's connexions with practices of a like kind in other places, and the more extenſive influence it may conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have upon the happineſs of mankind, it is at leaſt doubtful if it would then be right. I am ready to allow, that was it <hi>certain</hi> that their condition here is happier on the whole, than in their own country, your premiſes, in this <hi>independent view</hi> of the matter, would well warrant your concluſion; but even this I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend is far from being true. You have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the miſery and wretchedneſs of theſe people in their native land, in a light indeed diſagreeable enough: But I am ſtill diſpoſed from my apprehenſion of the dignity of the rational nature, at leaſt to hope that your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring is a little too ſtrong; and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

But allowing it to be very conſiderable, allowing that the privileges and advantages of a <hi>free</hi> member, of a <hi>free ſociety,</hi> where uſeful ſciences and the liberal arts are patronized and flouriſh, and where all thoſe principles that beautify and adorn the rational nature are cultivated, are comparatively very great: What, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you has all this to do with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent queſtion?

This though long ſmothered is now a truth well known; and 'tis aſtoniſhing that the patience with which they endure the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt ſervitude, ſhould not, long e're this time have rectified this miſtake. But I may not enlarge here; the abſurdity of this argument is too glaring to juſtify a ſerious confutation.</p>
            <p>It is alſo alledged, that <q>in their own country they are unneceſſarily ignorant of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our holy religion.</q> This indeed, generally underſtood, is confeſſedly a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly truth. The advantages they enjoy from revelation are not to be mentioned. Thoſe feeble rays of nature's light which the fatal apoſtacy of our original parents has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily left unextinguiſhed in their poſterity, are
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012917_0043_0F8E6DC45321A0F8"/>their almoſt only guide: And the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of theſe, for the purpoſes of moral direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is confeſſedly but too evident from the ignorance of thoſe, who are unhappily favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no other directors. But admitting this to be the caſe, that the advantages enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this people, of a religious nature, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſmall; before an argument can be hence derived in favor of their removal to this country, it muſt be ſhewn that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they here enjoy are greater. But if we examine the religious advantages of ſlaves in this country, I fear we ſhall find, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of our profeſſion, that they are not greatly ſuperior to thoſe of their brethren in <hi>Africa,</hi> at leaſt the exceſs will fall far ſhort of of an equivalent for the exceſs of their miſery.</p>
            <p>It is true, that in moſt parts of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſlaves are ſometimes permitted to attend public worſhip, but how much is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this, without the addition of private inſtruction, which heaven knows is but ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly afforded them, their acquaintance in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with the principles of chriſtianity abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly demonſtrates. And if we conſider their opportunities of inſtruction, in connexion with fixed prejudices againſt a religion, whoſe profeſſors they naturally conſider as avowedly
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012917_0044_0F8E6DC5220FF880"/>violating one of the plaineſt laws of nature; and add to this, the ſtrong temptations they are under, from the nature of their condition, to every ſpecies of iniquity, we ſhall hardly expect to find in them more of the ſpirit of true <hi>practical</hi> religion, than is to be found in thoſe who never heard of the goſpel. And whether this is not in fact generally the caſe, is by no means a queſtion to thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them. But admitting the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility that ſome individuals, may be benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this way; ſhall this be alledged as an equivalent for all the miſeries to which theſe people are, by this practice, inevitably ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the ſure and certain deſtruction to which ſuch multitudes are hereby devoted? As well may the deſign of propagating chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian knowledge, be alledged in excuſe of the ſhocking cruelties practiſed on the miſerable <hi>Americans,</hi> by their mercileſs deſtroyers, the Spaniards and Portugueſe. Thus we ſee this formidable argument turns out upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, not leſs deficient than thoſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; and this practice of enſlaving our fellow men, though conſidered in this inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent view, notwithſtanding all that can be alledged, muſt be acknowledged altogether unjuſtifiable.</p>

But we muſt not ſtop here: Upon your own principles, we muſt conſider this practice <hi>in all its connexions;</hi> we muſt not only regard the evils of ſlavery in <hi>this</hi> country, but muſt take in alſo the miſeries and calamities that are by this means brought upon <hi>any</hi> of the human race. Before this practice can be juſtified, it muſt appear to be productive of <hi>general</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; it muſt correſpond with the general good of the <hi>whole.</hi> Now if we conſider the practice of ſlavery in this country, in it's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to countenance and encourage the ſame thing, as it is practiſed in the ſouthern colonies, and Weſt-Indies, it will appear much more glaringly iniquitous and unjuſt.
