            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>WHereas through the Favour of God, and his MAJESTY our SOVERAIGNE, we have continued unto us our present enjoyments, both Civil and Ecclesiastical, in this time of Calamity to others of his Majesties Plantations, especially in the Caribdee Islands, by reason of the Malignity of the Common Enemy.</hi> The consideration of whose present distressed condition with a fellow-sympathy and helpfulness to them his Majesty in his gracious Letters, hath commended to his Subjects of this Colony, signifying, that what is done therein, would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as an expression of our loyalty to himself. The Consideration whereof is also further commended unto us by his Excellency the <hi>Lord Willoughby</hi> his Majesties <hi>Governour</hi> of those parts, declaring how seasonable some present supply of Provisions to his Majesties Forces against the common Enemy would now be, and also understanding the fleet is very sickly by reason of the want of such Provisions as are good and comfortable for their present state; notwithstanding such supplies as have been from time to time sent hence, upon the Adventure of Merchants and Gentlemen, on their private accompts, whereby not only themselves have sustained great losses many wayes, but also the Publique is thereby much disabled to afford further supply as were to be desired.</p>
            <p>From the considerations abovesaid, we do commend to the Inhabitants of this Jurisdiction a present contribution to be made for the supply of his Majesties Fleet in those parts, to be sent to the <hi>Lord Willoughby,</hi> to the end it may be accordingly distributed among them, as his Excellency in his wisdom shall see meet; and considering that expedition will be of absolute necessity, we do therefore Nominate and Appoint our loving Friends the Gentlemen here under named, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in Boston Mr. <hi>Edward Ting, Captain William Davis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hezekiah Usher,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Jolliffe, Captain James Oliver, Captain Thomas Lake,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Dean,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Oliver,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Brattle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey Davy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Anthony Stoddard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Bach,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Richard Wharton.</hi> In Charlstown, <hi>Captain John Allin, Liutenant Randal Nicholls, Liutenant Richard Sprague,</hi> Mr <hi>James Russel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Laurance Hammond.</hi> And in Salem <hi>Captain George Corwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Browne, Captain Walter Price.</hi> For Norfolk, <hi>Captain Robert Pike.</hi> For Portsmouth and Dover Mr. <hi>John Cutts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Cutts, Captain Richard Waldern</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nath. Fryer.</hi> In Hampshire, <hi>Captain John Pynchon. Liutenant Clarke</hi> of Northampton, <hi>and Liutenant Smith</hi> of Hadley. They, or the major part of them to receive the free Contributions of the respective parts of the Countrey, and they or any five of them to take order immediately for the Hire of a Vessel, taking care that her Loading be of such Provisions as be good and sound, and no other, and what they shall do herein to render an account thereof to the <hi>Governour</hi> or <hi>Deputy Governour,</hi> from time to time from whom they shall receive Order for their immediate Sayling.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen above named, are also impowred to communicate this to the several Towns, so as may have the best tendancy for the furtherance of the end propounded.</p>
            <p>This Act of the Magistrates is forthwith to be printed and sent accordingly to the several Towns.</p>
