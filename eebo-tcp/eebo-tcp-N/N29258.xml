            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AUSPICIOUS was the day, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the world the <hi>birth</hi> of our illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious and beloved WASHINGTON. Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſteem for his character, and gratitude for his public ſervices, have enrolled it amongſt the anniverſaries of AMERICA. Oft, on its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, have her early patriots and heroes rallied round the <hi>ſtandard</hi> of Liberty, with cheerful hearts and ſmiling countenances, to enjoy the grateful feſtivity. While they indulged to pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflections, extolling his virtues, expatiating on his indefatigable labours, and recounting to their ſons the various occurrences of the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, the hardſhips they endured, the dangers they eſcaped, and the precious blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their liberties coſt, <hi>the thought,</hi> that this GREAT FATHER of his country ſtill lived, conſummated their ſocial enjoyment. This they celebrated as one of their happieſt days.</p>
            <p>THE revolving ſeaſons have completed their circuits. The <hi>day</hi> has again dawned; and we are aſſembled. But the <hi>ſcene!</hi> Oh! how reverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038972_0003_1012399E1396C928"/>
Inſtead of ſongs of joy, and feſtive enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, our eyes behold the ſabled deſk, our ears are accoſted with the woful knell and funeral dirges, and a whole nation is ſhrouded in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. WASHINGTON IS NO MORE. Not the <hi>dear partner</hi> of his life only, the faithful domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, his particular circle of friends, and thoſe in public life; but COLUMBIA, humanity, virtue and the world feel the ſhock, and weep. Tears, on ſuch a ſolemn occaſion, are not weakneſs, but a virtue, a <hi>patriotic virtue:</hi> for it is thus a grateful nation embalms the memory of the MAN, whom all eſteemed, and all delighted to honour.</p>
            <p>COULD eminence of character, noble achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the affections of his country, have pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged above mortality, this man had not died. In him united true magnanimity with more than princely, with <hi>republican virtues.</hi> He was an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to human nature, an honour to this weſtern world. What mere man ever proved a greater national bleſſing, or left behind a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently finiſhed character?</p>
            <p>WHEN ſo much endeared worth draws off the ſtage, decency and our feelings ſanction the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, in ages paſt, of commemorating brilliant virtue, and tranſmitting heroic deeds to poſterity. The death of great and good men has always been lamented, as a public calamity. Did not all Iſrael weep for Moſes? and all Judah and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038972_0004_101239A0C6F7F750"/>
for king Hezekiah? UNITED AME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICA<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all alive to affection and gratitude, through every ſtate, with all her millions of hearts and tongues, pays her departed WASHINGTON, this day, her voluntary tribute of tender grief; eulogizing his ſublime virtues, proclaiming the diſtinguiſhed actions of his life, and holding up to view his amiable example.</p>
            <p>WHILE, with the affectionate tear ſwelling in the eye, we unite to deplore the loſs of this GREAT FRIEND and BENEFACTOR of his country, let us indulge the melancholy pleaſure of contemplating ſome of the <hi>leading traits</hi> of a character, which the world, with one conſent, admires, eſteems and reveres; a <hi>pre-eminent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> in which ſtand concentrated and diſplayed the virtues of the MILITARY HERO, of the PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRIOTIC STATESMAN, and of the PRIVATE CITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZEN.</p>
            <p>SIMPLE narration here is the higheſt eulogy.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON THE GREAT deſcended from a virtuous and reſpectable family. The place famed for his nativity is the pariſh called Waſhington, in the county of Weſtmoreland, and ſtate of Virginia. And the day, ſignalized in our calendar by that happy event, is February 22d, 1732.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:038972_0005_101239A3BA4772E8"/>DESIGNED by Heaven for a diſtinguiſhed Actor on the great theatre of the world, the SUPREME PARENT of all was bountiful to him in the gifts of nature. His <hi>form</hi> was majeſtic and graceful. His <hi>countenance</hi> mingled gravity with mildneſs, and wore impreſſive tokens of penetration, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and fortitude. His <hi>diſpoſition</hi> was gentle, but firm; modeſt, but courageous; cheerful, yet reſerved; active and perſevering. True <hi>genius</hi> he poſſeſſed, accompanied with ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and great <hi>energy of mind,</hi> tempered with cool deliberation. His <hi>education,</hi> though private, was upon a liberal and extenſive plan, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly favourable to virtuous morals. And his YOUTHFUL EXERCISES conſpired to add firmneſs to his conſtitution, and vigour to his mental ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>FORMED to figure, no ſooner did opportunity preſent, than he exhibited convincing ſpecimens of ſuperior abilities. Before his arrival at the age of twenty, he commenced a military life, in the reſpectable rank of Major. Being a <hi>confidential character,</hi> in 1753 he was charged with a ſpecial meſſage of remonſtrance to the French, upon their depredations on the weſtern Britiſh fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; and at the ſame time entruſted with full authority to treat with the ſavage natives. The important commiſſion he fulfilled in ſuch a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly manner, as at once evinced his great talents and virtues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:038972_0006_101239A56563CED0"/>AT the age of about twenty-three, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the office of Lieutenant Colonel; and ſoon after, to that of Colonel. In the war which enſued, he was an active and valiant offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. The policy of his meaſures, and his ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exertions, never failed to do him honour. Redſtone witneſſed his proweſs, and furniſhed trophies of victory. But his conduct, at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable time of Gen. Braddock's defeat, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the applauſe both of Great-Britain and the colonies. In that unhappy engagement he was a volunteer, and extra Aid-de-Camp. Acquainted with the Indian mode of fighting, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of danger, he ſolicited leave to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the regular troops, and ſcour the woods with a party. Had he been permitted, that ſlaughtered army had probably been ſaved. But the haughty General contemptuouſly denied his requeſt. The conſequence was, he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by an attack, principally of Indians in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade. A bloody ſcene enſued. Braddock fell; and all was confuſion. But, amidſt the general conſternation, under the direction and influence of young WASHINGTON, the militia covered the retreat of the remains of the Britiſh army, and prevented their entire deſtruction. And we may add, through the whole of that laſt French war, ſo far as his health admitted, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in contributing to the ſupport of the common cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:038972_0007_101239A7F4A4E9D8"/>UPON the reſtoration of tranquillity to the middle frontiers, after reſigning his commiſſion in 1759, he ſat down to cultivate the peaceful arts, as a farmer, at MOUNT VERNON. There he amuſed himſelf with agricultural employments, till the commencement of the American revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. During that interval, he was a civil "Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, a Judge of the Court, and conſtantly a Member of the Aſſembly."</p>
            <p>AS time rolled on, great events unfolded. At length the meditated ſubjugation of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can colonies to the parent country excited a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral alarm, and enkindled the flames of liberty. This riſing SON OF FAME immediately eſpouſed the cauſe of his injured country, and took a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided part in her favour.</p>
            <p>ESTABLISHED in his reputation, and poſſeſſing the confidence of the people, he ranks amongſt thoſe famous ſages and patriots who conſtituted the firſt Continental Congreſs, in 1774. There he breathed ſuch pure patriotiſm; diſcovered ſuch knowledge of human nature and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the ſtate of his country, and the arts of defence; and the virtues of his heart beamed ſo conſpicuouſly, that the delegates from every part of the Union were ſtruck with his greatneſs, and charmed with his goodneſs. He was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe elected a member of the ſecond renowned Congreſs, the next year.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:038972_0008_101239AAF9643ED8"/>PUBLIC difficulties increaſed, and the times grew more diſtreſſing. On April 19th, 1775, the revolutionary war began. An army was ſoon raiſed to defend the rights and liberties of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; and on June 15th, following, GEORGE WASHINGTON was unanimouſly appointed COMMANDER IN CHIEF. Powerful and regularly trained to war was the enemy he had to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and vaſt were the diſadvantages under which his infant country laboured. What were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined troops, without ammunition, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, clothing or money, to face an army of veterans? But when, to be a freeman or a ſlave, was the only alternative, not the moſt difficult nor dangerous proſpects could diſcourage a mind like his. Confiding in the righteouſneſs of his cauſe, and the God of armies, he did not heſitate to riſk his fortune, his character and life; and, with that ſelf-diſſidence, which is always an attendant on real worth, he accepted the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truſt.</p>
            <p>ALL eyes looked up to him; and never was the GENERAL played off to greater advantage. Should we follow him from the renowned heights encircling Boſton, through all the perilous and trying ſcenes of the revolution, till he obtained the final deciſive victory over Cornwallis, at Yorktown, we ſhould find, under all the different aſpects of public affairs, he uniformly acted the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038972_0009_101239AD5AB0E6A8"/>
ſame great part. What a mixture of painful and pleaſing reflections ſprings up in our minds at the recollection of the various occurrences and events which took place at Long-Iſland and New-Jerſey, at Trenton and Princeton, at Morriſtown, Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth! We trembled, and rejoiced; but he preſerved a ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy firmneſs. Threats could not intimidate, filthy lucre could not bribe him. He was brave in danger, and compaſſionate to the ſons of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. Proſperity did not make him arrogant, nor did he ſink under adverſity. Even in the darkeſt hour, when a general deſpondency ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over the public mind, and thouſands were ready to give up the cauſe as loſt, ſelf-collected and ſelf-poſſeſſed, he remained unmoved. And when reſources ſailed, retiring within himſelf, his ingenuity ſeemed to ſupply all defects, and his preſence inſpired heroic ardour.</p>
            <p>DEFENCE, and not conqueſt, was his object. To effect that, and not ſacrifice life, was his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. For him it was therefore reſerved to teach the world the defenſive art of war, refined upon principles of humanity: the true art of maneuvring and reconnoitring ſo dexterouſly, though ſometimes reduced to a little band, as to fruſtrate the enemy's ſubtleſt ſchemes, without hazarding an engagement: the ſecret art of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the favourable moment, and captivating
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038972_0010_101239AF030A5200"/>
whole armies, without deluging the land in blood. How many more have fallen in a ſingle battle in Europe, than fell during the whole American conteſt!</p>
            <p>NO General ever more entirely poſſeſſed the affections of his army. To this happy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it is to be attributed, that at a very criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal juncture, when their engagements were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring, and the enemy, fluſhed with high expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, were anticipating triumph, at his anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pathetic <hi>requeſt,</hi> they maintained their poſts, though in a deſtitute ſituation, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with extreme difficulties. The ſnow, crimſoned by their footſteps, witneſſed their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to attend him to victory, or to death.</p>
            <p>THROUGH a ſevere ſtruggle for liberty, this great DEFENDER of his country aſtoniſhed his enemies by the regular diſcipline which he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and maintained, by his judicious arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by his conſummate ſkill in evading, and vigorous exertions in the hour of battle. His heart, his tongue, his pen, his ſword, were all employed. Convinced at length of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicability of ſubduing the free-born ſons of America, the PARENT COUNTRY gave up the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and the glorious peace of 1783 ſucceeded. WASHINGTON conquered, and a nation was born. Bleſſed with peace and independence,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038972_0011_101239B19922E020"/>
from St. Croix to the remoteſt boundaries of Georgia, United America proclaimed his praiſe.</p>
            <p>THE great end of the military eſtabliſhment was no ſooner obtained, than to <hi>diſband the army</hi> became an important object. Having gloriouſly accompliſhed their arduous work, they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed compenſation for their labours and ſufferings. Gladly would CONGRESS have diſcharged all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears; but the ſtate of the <hi>national finances</hi> render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it impoſſible. Diſcontents aroſe, became alarming, and perhaps had embroiled the YOUNG REPUBLIC in <hi>civil war,</hi> had not their beloved GENERAL, by a ſpirited, <hi>patriotic Addreſs,</hi> calmed their minds, and prevailed with them to return peaceably to their reſpective homes. But, VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUOUS PATRIOT! having at every ſtage of the war paid a ſacred deference to the <hi>civil authority,</hi> he would not at its cloſe have his arms diſgraced by riſing in oppoſition to it.</p>
            <p>THE freedom and ſovereignty of his country being eſtabliſhed, the triumphant WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, December 23d, 1783, cheerfully reſigned his <hi>conquering ſword,</hi> and with it his <hi>high commiſſion,</hi> to the NATIONAL COUNCIL. The ſame day he filled the firſt military ſtation, and voluntarily took the rank of a common citizen. What <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime patriotiſm!</hi> what <hi>auguſt magnanimity!</hi> Then, amidſt the congratulations and bleſſings of a renovated nation, he retired to his delightful
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038972_0012_101239B3440E6420"/>
MOUNT VERNON, to participate the tranquillity and happineſs of domeſtic life.</p>
            <p>HERE he conſummated one career of glory, quitted the field with unſpotted fame, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalized his character.</p>
            <p>UNITED AMERICA felt her SOVEREIGNTY, and roſe at once to high reſpectability on the liſt of nations. The ſun of republican glory ſhone with full-orbed rays. Our political horizon was clear, and the proſpect bright and promiſing. But, alas! ſoon the clouds began to gather, and a tempeſt to ariſe.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Confederation,</hi> that recommendatory form of government, which proved ſufficient during the war, while the enthuſiaſtic ſpirit of liberty prevailed, was found to want energy in a time of peace. Through the influence of deſigning men, in 1786, a <hi>rebellion</hi> was fomented in the weſtern part of this State, which threatened to involve the Union in war. Alarmed at the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the country, a <hi>Convention</hi> was formed in 1787, for the general purpoſe of conſulting the public good. Here the wiſdom of a WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON was required. He was accordingly choſen one of the members, and accepted their invitation to preſide. After four months' deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, our moſt excellent FEDERAL CONSTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTION
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038972_0013_101239B6F9C22200"/>
was completed; and, being ſanctioned by his approbation, it was ratified by the people</p>
            <p>WHEN that new ſyſtem came into operation, who ſo worthy to be the <hi>Supreme Executive Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate,</hi> as the MAN who had defended and ſaved his devoted country? WASHINGTON, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſſenting voice, was elected PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. To him the call of his country was the call of Heaven. Though independent in his circumſtances, he relinquiſhed the charms of rural retreat for the cares and burdens of high <hi>reſponſibility.</hi> April 30th, 1789, he was inaugurated at New York; and with a modeſt dignity peculiar to himſelf aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Chair of State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE enſuing autumn he favoured theſe Eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern States with a paternal, circular viſit. What heart-felt ſatisfaction it afforded, their unfeigned teſtimonials evinced.</p>
            <p>WITH him at the head of its <hi>Supreme Council,</hi> the nation was happy. Political diſſenſions ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and general proſperity ſmiled. At the periodical election, the united ſuffrages of a free and enlightened people continued him in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſtation. Had it not been for the reſtleſs ſavages of the wilderneſs, and the intrigues of foreign emiſſaries, and internal foes, our national tranquillity had been uninterrupted: but from
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038972_0014_101239B8A4A604E0"/>
theſe ſources originated a complication of evils. To HIS vigilance, wiſe moderation, and pacific diſpoſition, we are greatly obligated for averting the impending judgments. Uniting the arm of power with the voice of clemency, he concluded an <hi>honourable peace</hi> with the Indian tribes. When, at the inſtigation of the enemies of government, a <hi>formidable inſurrection</hi> aroſe in the ſtate of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, mingling mercy and energy, he taught ſucceeding ages how to quell a tumult. By an early declaration of <hi>neutrality,</hi> he happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented America being involved in the wars of Europe. When the ſubtle, intriguing, ſyſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Genet and his accomplices were unwearied in their endeavours to divide the people from their government, and precipitate hoſtilities with Great-Britain, his <hi>conciliatory meaſures</hi> fruſtrated their machiavelian policy. And when an attempt was made by the national LEGISLATIVE to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach on the EXECUTIVE branch of government, he boldly interpoſed, and preſerved the <hi>balance</hi> between the conſtitutional powers.</p>
            <p>PATRIOTISM ſeemed the ruling paſſion of his ſoul. A ſingle eye to America's true intereſt influenced all his foreign intercourſe and negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and indeed the whole of his adminiſtration. No lucrative motives, no party ſpirit, no bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed zeal, perverted his judgment. The <hi>ſcales of juſtice</hi> he poiſed with even hand. And knowing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038972_0015_101239BB5B7E8360"/>
the importance of good morals and examples to the community, he paid attention to true dignity of character as a recommendatory qualification for promotion.</p>
            <p>EIGHT years he ſhone in the firſt ſeat of government, the admiration of other nations, the glory of his own; till the political ferment was allayed, and by the ſmiles of Heaven he ſaw America the happieſt of all countries, the land of rational liberty, the ſeat of ſcience, and every order of citizens enjoying unprecedented proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. There no doubt he had continued to ſhine, had he not declined <hi>a re-election.</hi> But, advanced in years, and no preſſing neceſſity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his public labours, he choſe to retire again to the pleaſing walks of private life, to ſhare in common with his countrymen the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of that government, which he had been ſo ſucceſsful in eſtabliſhing. Crowned with the double thanks and bleſſings of all ranks, his favourite rural ſeat welcomed his return. There he contemplated ſpending the evening of life in peace, without the moſt diſtant thought of ever being called to office again.</p>
            <p>BUT this PATRIOTIC FATHER would not withdraw from public life, without bequeathing his country an invaluable legacy, in his VALE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICTORY ADDRESS. There ſtands recorded a ſyſtem of principles and precepts, worthy to be inſcribed on every American heart; a <hi>ſyſtem,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:038972_0016_101239BD16108388"/>
which, duly regarded, muſt terminate in the conſummation of republican glory.</p>
            <p>THUS he exemplified the ACCOMPLISHED STATESMAN, as illuſtriouſly as he had before the INVINCIBLE HERO.</p>
            <p>AT the peaceful cloſe of his wiſe adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how natural to expect proſperous and <hi>happy days!</hi> But oh! the mutability and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all human affairs! No ſooner had he begun to enjoy retirement, than the diſtracted ſtate of European politics alarmed the world; and the hoſtile proceedings of the DIRECTORY of France endangered the peace and independence of America. To ſupport her dignity, military preparations by land, as well as an armed neutrality at ſea, became neceſſary. On the VENERABLE WASHINGTON all hearts were fixed, to take the charge of the army. One grade more of glory awaited him. He was accordingly the ſecond time, with perfect unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, appointed to the chief military command in 1798. Patriotiſm glowed too fervently in his heart, to decline acceptance. To his honour be it recorded, his <hi>commiſſion</hi> he received from his SUCCESSOR IN OFFICE. Though grown old in ſerving his country, this mighty Chieftain was ready to ſpend his laſt breath in her cauſe. A general joy announced his welcome to office, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038972_0017_10123631E7000628"/>
martial fire began to kindle. With ſuch a GENERAL, who but pronounced American arms invincible? Had neceſſity called him to the field, every patriotic heart and every reſource had been at his command. While his name, more mighty than a hoſt, had ſtruck ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror through the boldeſt enemy, how muſt it have inſpired the brave ſons of liberty with redoubled heroiſm!—But here, alas! here cloſes one of the moſt endeared and valuable of lives. Gods on earth die like men. WASHINGTON himſelf muſt die. And he died the ſame GREAT MAN he lived. This high office he honoured, when the SUPREME LORD OF LIFE iſſued his higher orders. Readily he obeyed; and, December the 14th, 1799, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a groan, "<hi>cloſed his own eyes, and died.</hi>"</p>
            <p>AND has his <hi>great mind</hi> fled? Does he rank no more on the liſt of frail mortals? Will he no longer guide our public councils, no more lead on our armies to victory? Heaven has ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed. What mingled emotions ſtruggle in our hearts! His mourning country thinks no tokens of honour too much to confer on his memory. The world reſounds with his praiſes. Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come will riſe up in ſucceſſion, and call him bleſſed.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>greatly beloved</hi> of men was likewiſe an object of ſpecial divine guardianſhip. Numerous
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038972_0018_101239C3E5159760"/>
were the imminent dangers he eſcaped, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal the deliverances he experienced. His God not only nerved his arm, but covered his head in the day of battle. In devout acknowledgment for his providential preſervation, it is worthy of remark, that in "June, 1776, a plot was medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, under the direction of Gov. Tryon," and "managed by the then Mayor" of New-York, to take away General WASHINGTON'S life, "either by poiſon or aſſaſſination; and Thomas Hickey, one of his life-guard, was engaged in it." But the conſpiracy was ſeaſonably diſcovered, and he "was tried by a court martial, found guilty, and executed." Heaven protects her favourites!</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON is a name that will always bear ſuperior rank in the temple of fame. Should we contraſt his merits with the warriors, ſages and politicians of former or preſent times, he would but gather brilliancy from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. View him at the head of a ſmall, unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, fluctuating army, labouring under almoſt every embarraſſment, and yet maintaining his cauſe againſt one of the moſt powerful nations of the earth; and how diminutively does Xerxes appear, though he commanded the greateſt milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry force that ever marched into the field! how deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable all the ancient conquerors of the world! Their victories only added to the miſeries of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038972_0019_101239C59DF1DCF0"/>
mankind. And what are the modern leaders of armies in Europe? That once happy land, they have converted into a field of blood.—When oppoſed to the wiſe men of Greece and Rome, his luſtre obſcures their feeble rays.—And ſhould we look into the moral and political ſyſtems of antiquity, how imperfect were all the productions of Hermes, Minos and Lycurgus, of Numa, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon and Confucius, in compare with his morals and politics? And who in latter days will boaſt a competition with him? If ever he was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it muſt be by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh Lawgiver.</hi> He was confeſſedly under divine inſpiration, and we would be ſpared an invidious compariſon of merits: but all muſt acknowledge, that in many reſpects there is a ſtriking reſemblance between theſe two great national DELIVERERS and SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOURS.</p>
            <p>ILLUSTRIOUS characters are too often ſhaded with ſome groſs miſtakes, or ſtained by flagrant vices: but WASHINGTON'S will ever ſtand on record, a brilliant exception. Through all the viciſſitudes of war and peace, nothing occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to eclipſe his increaſing glory, or fully his reputation. Every new ſphere of action gained him a freſh wreath of laurels.—Not the moſt <hi>perfect virtue</hi> indeed is ſecurity againſt the enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed tongue of ſlander. There was a time
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038972_0020_101239C753F16090"/>
when groundleſs jealouſy, or party rage, wiſhed to depoſe him, and the pen of infamy attacked his meaſures: but his uniform wiſdom, virtue and fidelity confounded their madneſs and folly. Neither malice nor envy could ſupport the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a charge againſt him. He had no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies but the enemies of his country and good government; and their defamation was public fame.</p>
            <p>TO theſe general ſtrokes we would add that <hi>diſintereſted benevolence,</hi> which graced his public character. Through the whole revolutionary ſcenes, both as GENERAL and PRESIDENT, his generous heart declined all perſonal compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſervices. His vaſt fortune ſuperſeded all neceſſity; and a conſciouſneſs of promoting the general welfare was itſelf ample ſatisfaction. Where in the annals of hiſtory ſhall we trace ſuch <hi>exalted generoſity,</hi> ſuch <hi>patriotic philanthropy!— Love of fame,</hi> it is granted, has wrought wonders. But no man ever appeared to be leſs under the influence of this paſſion. Beſides, had this been his motive, after finiſhing ſo glorious a military life, who at ſuch a criſis would have hazarded the uncertain iſſue of another probation?</p>
            <p>THE field he did not enter to conquer territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to deſtroy his enemies, or to acquire renown; nor did he accept the reins of government to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038972_0021_101239C9C283A570"/>
gratify ambition, and ſoar in grandeur: but he united the PATRIOT and HERO, to oppoſe tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to guard COLUMBIA's birthright, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to poſterity the liberties GOD and nature gave. Her cauſe he vindicated upon ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles, as involve the prerogatives of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. He is therefore juſtly entitled to the high appellation of the ASSERTOR of natural rights, the DEFENDER of liberty, the SUPPORTER of a free government, and the FRIEND of man.</p>
            <p>WHILE we dwell on ſuch <hi>lovely greatneſs,</hi> how does the afflicting thought return and melt our hearts—<hi>HE ſleeps in duſt!</hi> But though dead, he ſtill <hi>lives.</hi> He lives in medals and ſtatues, in monuments and portraits, in the ſong of poets, and page of hiſtory; but, to nobler purpoſe, in virtuous example and in the affections of grateful millions. Nor does he only live; HE ſpeaks, and will bleſs mankind to the remoteſt ages, in his admirable "<hi>ſyſtem of political morality,</hi>" equally celebrated for ſublimity of ſentiment, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of ſtyle.</p>
            <p>THIS firſt of HEROES and PATRIOTS was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the higheſt ſtations UNITED AMERICA afforded, and he dignified every office he ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But he did not figure only in the field and the cabinet; his <hi>perſonal virtues</hi> were as amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as his <hi>public</hi> were illuſtrious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:038972_0022_101239CC1B00CBC8"/>FROM the noiſy <hi>parade</hi> of war, and dazzling <hi>ſplendour</hi> of court equipage, let us retire to <hi>Mount Vernon,</hi> and contemplate WASHINGTON as a PRIVATE CITIZEN.</p>
            <p>VIEWED in the <hi>occupation</hi> of a huſbandman, all was neat, elegant, and on an extenſive and uſeful plan. Probably not a man in the Union exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in a landed intereſt, or made more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious obſervations and arrangements. Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was his delightful buſineſs; and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this honourable branch of living, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an important object. His attention of courſe was turned to the different qualities of ſoil, and the beſt manner and means of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The knowledge he obtained in this art, he readily communicated, and recommended fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and diverſified experiments, as the only way to carry it to perfection. As a <hi>man,</hi> he was a pattern of meekneſs, temperance, ſobriety and benevolence, invariably acting upon the genuine principles of truth, honour and righteouſneſs. As the <hi>head of a family,</hi> he maintained regularity and due ſubordination, mingling economy with liberal hoſpitality. As a <hi>huſband,</hi> he was kind, tender and affectionate. As a <hi>father,</hi> he had no children but the patrons of virtue and liberty, and theſe he defended and nurtured at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his life and property. As a <hi>maſter,</hi> his humanity and reaſonable commands engaged the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038972_0023_101239CE81F5B968"/>
love and obedience of his ſervants. As a <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> he was peaceable, obliging, and abounded in acts and offices of kindneſs. As a <hi>friend,</hi> he was ſincere, faithful and confidential. As a <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor to the poor,</hi> he manifeſted a tender heart, and flowing generoſity. As a <hi>member of ſociety,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted not his own ſeparate intereſt, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. As <hi>one of the community,</hi> he was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary ſubject, public ſpirited, and punctually conformed to the laws of the land. In a word, his <hi>heart</hi> appeared a ſeat of the virtues; and his <hi>manners</hi> diſplayed a noble ſimplicity, and graceful dignity, in the <hi>true republican taſte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>crown</hi> of all his glory was his PIETY. WASHINGTON was a CHRISTIAN—a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed friend to chriſtianity. With all his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he did not diſdain to be accounted the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſciple of a CRUCIFIED NAZARENE: and his life was a practical comment on the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. A divine providence he acknowledged in all his ſucceſſes, and gave the glory to GOD. Stated ſeaſons of retirement for devotion he was known daily to obſerve. The chriſtian ſabbath he ſtrictly regarded, and practiſed attendance on public worſhip. Divine inſtitutions were ſacred in his eſteem, and he was a <hi>communicant</hi> at the LORD'S TABLE. Educated in the <hi>Epiſcopal Church,</hi> he retained that form of worſhip; but extended candour and liberality of ſentiment to the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038972_0024_101239D0D669CEE8"/>
and good of every nation and religion. Thus by his exemplary life he diſcountenanced athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, infidelity, and all immoralities; and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the practice of virtue and piety to the world.</p>
            <p>THIS is the man whoſe <hi>birth</hi> we this day commemorate, and whoſe <hi>death</hi> we mourn. He was <hi>great</hi> without oſtentation, and <hi>good</hi> without ſuperſtition.—Should it be ſaid, So <hi>exalted a character</hi> ſpeaks ſomething more than man, I would reply, It rather proclaims the <hi>true dignity of man,</hi> as it unites real goodneſs to true greatneſs, and proves that human virtue may be greatly ſublimated and refined. What is not our nature capable of exemplifying? It may ſink into the loweſt depths of vice and wretchedneſs, or it may riſe to eminent attainments in moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. —To deny him the imperfections of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, would create a juſt ſuſpicion that all was but empty panegyric, and a piece of ſtate policy. By univerſal conſent, he is entitled to one of the greateſt and beſt of human characters; but his <hi>modeſty</hi> would bluſh, and his <hi>piety,</hi> even in heaven, be ſhocked, could he know he was ſtyled on earth <hi>more</hi> than man.</p>
            <p>WE would not detract from the honours due to a vigorous and perſevering CONGRESS, and to a brave and determined ARMY; nor depreciate the abilities and merits of his CO-PATRIOTS and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038972_0025_101239D3382732C8"/>
HEROES. They did worthily; and procured to themſelves immortal fame. The pen of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will do juſtice to their memories. But it never wounded their moſt <hi>delicate ſenſibilities</hi> to yield up the palm to WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>WHILE we eulogize talents ſo great, virtues ſo reſplendent, and deeds ſo noble, let it not be thought too foreign from the preſent ſolemnity, to moralize the inſtructive theme. FRIENDS OF RELIGION! Let not our grief prevent devout effuſions of gratitude to Heaven, for raiſing up this great DELIVERER of the oppreſſed, and GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY. Surely it was becauſe GOD had a favour for our land, that he capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated him for ſuch a great part in life, and brought him upon the ſtage at the critical period of public exigency. <hi>Divine Providence</hi> ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the union of all hearts in him, in the wiſdom and valour which marked all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and in the ſucceſs attending them. He was a great inſtrument in the hand of God of our national independence and proſperity; and never perhaps was more glory due to one man. But it is no diſparagement to his worth to look beyond all ſecondary cauſes, and aſcribe ſupreme glory to the GREAT OVERRULING POWER.</p>
            <p>RELIGION teaches us likewiſe to attend to the providence of GOD, in the time and manner of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038972_0026_101239D590D88FA0"/>
his departure. He was not cut down at an early age, nor in the midſt of his days; but he filled up a long life of ſervice and glory. And he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by treachery and artifice under cover of friendſhip, as Abner fell; not by an open enemy, as ſons of valour often prematurely fall; nor by his own hand, in a paroxyſm of deſpair, as blood-thirſty conquerors ſometimes ignominiouſly die: but, as frail humanity is ordinarily doomed to cloſe life, by <hi>natural diſeaſe.</hi> HE bleſſed his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and died in peace, on <hi>a bed of virtue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> ſurrounded with his deareſt connexions and friends—And where elſe would a <hi>good man</hi> wiſh to die?</p>
            <p>THE diſorder which <hi>Heaven</hi> commiſſioned over his life was an inflammation of the throat; in technical ſtyle, "<hi>Cynache Trachealis.</hi>" Sudden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and violent was the attack, as if the King of Terrors was conſcious of ſome mighty taſk, jealous of his ſuperior power or policy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing his dear country ſhould have opportunity to raiſe one petition for his life.—Was it then reſerved for this <hi>grim Tyrant</hi> of our race to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſo much greatneſs? No. Such honour was too great. It was not death, but WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, who conquered. His laſt and greateſt victory was over the fear of death. His triumph he ſung, when, with entire compoſure and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he proclaimed, in the audience of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends, "I HAVE NO FEAR TO DIE."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:038972_0027_101239D8016CA790"/>HAVING lived his day, and faithfully perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great work aſſigned him, acquieſcing in the divine will, he conſigned his weary limbs to the peaceful tomb, where his conquering LORD and Maſter lay; there to ſleep, till he ſhould come again, and clothe them with a glorious immortality. His GREAT SOUL we contemplate removed to higher ſpheres, and nobler ſcenes of action; not deſtined to join the Caligulas, the Neros, the Robeſpierres; but advanced to the higheſt rank of worthies in the pure realms of peace and glory. May a double portion of his excellent ſpirit ever reſt on his ſucceſſors in office!</p>
            <p>HEIRS OF MORTALITY! With what pathetic energy does WASHINGTON's death preach to America and the world, a ſerious lecture on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frailty! "Duſt to duſt," is the common doom of our fallen nature. In every age, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, politicians and warriors have come upon the ſtage, acted their parts, and then retired. Diſtinctions of birth, of rank and fortune, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal accompliſhments and mighty achievements, avail not here. The great, the good, and <hi>all,</hi> muſt die. Who can dwell on ſo much <hi>greatneſs laid in duſt,</hi> and not ſelf-appropriate the ſolemn ſcene? <hi>To be prepared,</hi> comprehends the whole duty of life. "Ceaſe from man," and feel your dependence on God.</p>
            <p>REPUBLICAN CITIZENS! Virtue is the ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our government, and good examples are
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038972_0028_101239DA9337C8D8"/>
replete with moral inſtruction. Inſenſibly they charm the heart, and poſſeſs a conſtraining influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the life. The <hi>Chriſtian Exemplar</hi> alone is perfect, and worthy to be our <hi>ſupreme ſtandard:</hi> but what we juſtly admire and eſteem in others, deſerves our imitation. And where ſhall we find a fairer, brighter, or more excellent human pattern, than the life of WASHINGTON? It compriſes a rich aſſemblage of public and private virtues, accommodated to the higheſt and loweſt walks of life. Formed upon the <hi>true ſublime,</hi> it commands univerſal admiration. MAY WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON BE THE MODEL OF OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER!</p>
            <p>AMERICAN YOUTH! To fire your ambition, and excite a virtuous emulation, we would hold him up to your view. Would you ſhun the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and follies of your age? would you riſe to eminence in your day, and prove bleſſings to your country and the world? would you rejoice the hearts of your friends? would you be wiſe and good, great and happy? would you live eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and die lamented? Follow his amiable and virtuous example. Remember his paternal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Imbibe his republican principles; and let his <hi>precious legacy</hi> be your <hi>political oracle.</hi> When to you it falls to guide the helm of ſtate, make that your <hi>pole ſtar</hi> and <hi>compaſs.</hi> He lived not for himſelf only, but for you and poſterity after you, for America and the human race.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:038972_0029_101239DDC1B66290"/>SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF LIBERTY! Behold a revolutionizing world! Under the oſtenſible colour of freedom, fraternity and the rights of man, deſolation and ſlaughter are diſplayed amongſt the ancient nations of Europe, on ſuch a ſanguinary ſcale of terror, as makes all the fine feelings of humanity ſhudder, remonſtrate and agonize. See there, attempts, at once to ſubvert all religion and government. View the human heart unprincipled, and mechanically petrified. Thanks to Heaven! you are bleſſed with a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier lot, than to inhabit climes unfriendly to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. You are no degraded race of bondmen and vaſſals. United America is the land of peace and enjoyment. Here you realize the ſweets of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and refined ſociety. No country ever preſented proſpects more favourable to poſterity. But, reflect and conſider how much you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to WASHINGTON for your diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed privileges; and, while all parties mingle tears at his departure, let his name ſerve as a taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and prove an indiſſoluble bond of union to all.</p>
            <p>FRIENDS OF PEACE AND GOOD GOVERNMENT! Could this GREAT FATHER of liberty witneſs the ſolemnities of this day, and addreſs us from the abodes of immortality, with AMERICA ſtill engraven on his heart, would he not, with more than mortal eloquence, ſanction his former coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, enjoining a charge, on all her citizens, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038972_0030_101239DF648ABC80"/>
ſentiments like theſe? Baniſh forever from your public counſels and your hearts, all party ſpirit, and all diſorganizing and demoraliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles. Watch with eagle-eye againſt encroachments on your rights and privileges, as men and chriſtians; but never indulge unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able jealouſies of the rulers of your own choice. Keep your elections free and uncorrupted. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port public credit, and the dignity of your Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral and State Governments. Promote literary inſtitutions, agriculture and manufactures. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve national faith and juſtice. Encourage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, frugality and improvements. Guard againſt foreign influence and intrigue, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due national attachments and antipathies. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be entangled in the politics of foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Cultivate harmony and commercial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with all the world, upon the great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of truth and righteouſneſs. Study peace with all nations: but be, at all times, prepared for war. Let your union be perpetual. And remember, RELIGION and MORALITY are the foundation of national greatneſs, as well as of perſonal excellence. Practiſe therefore the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſocial virtues, and live up to the true ſpirit of chriſtianity.—This is the beſt eulogy you can pronounce on my memory, the ſureſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of gratitude and affection. Thus you will ſecure the bleſſing of Heaven, and always ſuſtain the rank of a great and free, a reſpected and happy nation.</p>

How then ſhall we cloſe the affecting theme! Muſt CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUMBIA be inconſolable? Shall the tide of grief forever flow! This would in effect impeach the ways of Providence. Surely what God does muſt be right; and reſignation to his will is a duty. Though WASHINGTON is not, it is enough HIS GOD never dies. Thanks to his name! ADAMS and a large catalogue of worthies ſtill live. Never yet has this highly-favoured land wanted for <hi>patriotic fathers</hi> and <hi>martial ſons.</hi> With our plaintive ſtrains let us mingle fervent ſupplications, that he would ſtill remember in mercy his American Iſrael, and raiſe up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſucceſſion of illuſtrious STATESMEN and HEROES. O THOU SUPREME DISPOSER of nations, ſtates and kingdoms! ever keep UNITED AMERICA under thy ſpecial protection. Be "a wall of fire round about," and the "glory in the midſt" of her. May her <hi>politics</hi> be always ſound, her <hi>morals</hi> pure, her <hi>greatneſs</hi> increaſing. And may ſhe never want for WASHINGTONS to direct her councils and command her armies, "till ſun and moon, and time and death, ſhall be no more."</p>
