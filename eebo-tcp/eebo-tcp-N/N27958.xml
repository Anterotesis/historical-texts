            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I have looked over the following account of my trial: ſo far as my memory ſerves me, it is as accurate as ſuch a publication can be, except perhaps in Mr. Rawle's reply; which without meaning to pay the Attorney General of the diſtrict, any unneceſſary compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was in my opinion delivered in neater language than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported here: the reporter accounts for this from the difficulty of hearing Mr. Rawle. I am pretty ſure there is no ſubſtantial er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in any part of the publication. I have thought it a duty to myſelf to add the notes and appendix; the public will judge of their contents.</p>
            <p>The Citizens of this Country may learn ſome uſeful leſſons from this trial; and principally, that if they mean to conſult their own peace and quiet, they will hold their tongues, and reſtrain their pens, on the ſubject of politics: at leaſt during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the SEDITION LAW; a Law, which I do not think "the powers that be," will incline to aboliſh. As it is, the plaineſt truths, and the moſt notorious facts, may be controverted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; and the innocent and well-meaning aſſerter of them, may be driven with impunity, to ſpend his time and exhauſt his finances, in procuring proof ſtrictly legal of what no man in common life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to doubt. Long before my trial I foreſaw this: and ſtated as an inſtance in point, the very caſe of evidence that actually occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſpecting the claim of Robbins. (vide the eſſay on the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Law, in my political eſſays.)</p>
            <p>I was previouſly determined, not to be put to the trouble and expence of ſending for evidence from Danbury to Charleſtown; or to be kept under Dionyſian tyranny, from court to court, and from term to term, with the ſword of the law ſuſpended over my head, dependant on the tender mercies of an <hi>ex-officio</hi> accuſer to ſpare the thread. I preferred to ascertain whether the evidence that common ſenſe would not reject, was likely to be admitted on a political trial. I preferred final to preliminary puniſhment, nor did I want to ſuffer the crafty malignant kindneſs of a <hi>noli-prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi> when my proofs were known to be compleat. Let the reader conſider the danger of uttering a truth, when he finds that I could not ſubſtantiate the notorious affidavit of Jonathan Robbins, without ſending 750 miles for the copy of a record, which Mr. Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering ſo ſtrangely omitted to procure. Reader, when you have peruſed this trial, ſhut the book, and reflect. <hi>I dare not</hi> ſtate the concluſions with which it is pregnant, but which muſt force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with melancholy conviction on your mind: aſk yourſelf how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is this a fair ſpecimen of the freedom you expected to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, from the adoption of the Federal Conſtitution? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Men who can ſanction theſe proceedings, are fit objects of re-election?</p>

            <head>PROCEEDINGS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE <hi>Vnited States.</hi> HELD IN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, FOR THE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA, APRIL 11, 1800.</head>
            <head type="sub">Against Thomas Cooper, Esq. of Northumberland, under the Act of Congress, passed July <hi>14</hi>th <hi>1798,</hi> intitled
<q>An Act in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Act intituled "An Act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,"</q>
commonly called the SEDITION LAW.</head>
            <p>ON Wedneſday, the 9th of April 1800, Mr. Cooper was informed by Mr. Hall the Marſhal of the Court, that a writ was iſſued againſt him for a libel. Mr. Hall wiſhed to know when it would be convenient for Mr. Cooper to attend at judge Peters's on the occaſion, and the next morning at 10 o'clock was fixed for that purpoſe. On attending there, judge Peters ſhewed Mr. Cooper a paper, of which the following is a copy: The publication of it appeared to be atteſted by John Buyers, Eſq. of Sunbury in Pennſylvania<note n="*" place="bottom">The paſſages printed in italic in the laſt paragraph, were thoſe ſelected for proſecution.

If it is, every paper devoted to truth, honour, and decency, ought to give it a thorough circulation.</p>
                                       <p>Not many months ago, it is ſaid, a Mr. Cooper, an Engliſhman, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Preſident of the United States to be appointed "agent for ſettling the reſpective claims of the citizens and ſubjects of this country and Great-Britain." In his letter he informs the Preſident that although (he Thomas Cooper) had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                             <desc>•</desc>

This letter was accompanied with another from Dr. Joſeph Prieſtly, who did not fail to aſſure the Preſident of the pliability of his friend Cooper's democratic principles.— The preſident, it is ſaid, rejected Cooper's application with diſdain, and Prieſtly's with ſtill ſtronger marks of ſurpriſe, ſaying, it is ſaid, as he threw the letter on the table, does he think that I would appoint any Engliſhman to that important office in preference to an American?—What was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence? When Thomas Cooper found his application for a lucrative of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice under our preſident rejected, he writes in revenge the addreſs which appeared in print, and dr. Prieſtly exerted his influence in diſperſing this very addreſs, which he muſt know was the offspring of diſappointment and revenge!!!</p>
                                       <p>The addreſs is as cunning and inſidious a production as ever appeared in the Aurora or the old Chronicle, and as for impudence, it exceeds or at leaſt equals, Porcupine himſelf. Prieſtley and Cooper are both called upon to deny the above narrative. A recourſe to the letters themſelves would eſtabliſh the accuracy of this anecdote even to a ſyllable.</p>

                        <p>Yes; I am the THOMAS COOPER, alluded to; luckily poſſeſſed of more accurate information than the malignant writer of that paragraph, from whatever ſource his intelligence was derived.</p>
                        <p>About the time of the appointment of commiſſioners under the Britiſh treaty, doctor Roſs, who had ſedulouſly brought about an intercourſe of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility between Mr. Liſton and myſelf, urged me to permit him to apply on my behalf to that gentleman for one of the appointments that muſt then take place. He preſſed on me the folly, as he termed it, of my confining myſelf to Northumberland, his earneſt wiſh to ſee me ſettled in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and the duty I owed my family to better my ſituation by every means in my power. He ſtated that mr. Liſton he knew thought highly of me, and though the poſt of the fifth commiſſioner was probably then diſpoſed of, there muſt be an agent for the Britiſh claimants; an office which from my ſituation as a barriſter in England, and my knowledge of mercantile tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037249_0005_100C9CFB82A8F820"/>
I was peculiarly fitted to fill. I replied that he probably over-rated Mr. Liſton's opinion, and his own influence, and that at all events my known political opinions muſt render it equally improper for Mr. Liſton to give, and for me to accept, any office whatever connected with the Britiſh intereſts. That Mr. Liſton and I underſtood each other on this queſtion, and had hitherto avoided all politics whatever. That being an American I ſhould not object to any office under <hi>this</hi> government, if I could fairly obtain it; but that I would never conſent to any application to Mr. Liſton.</p>
                        <p>Through Mr. Coleman's intereſt, Mr. Hall of Sunbury, was compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the offer of being appointed agent of American claims. On mentioning to Dr. Prieſtley one night at ſupper that Mr. Hall had declined it, Dr. Roſs's perſuaſions occurred to me, and I ſaid that ſuch an office as that would have ſuited me very well. Dr. Prieſtley replied if that was the caſe, he thought he had ſome intereſt with Mr. Adams, with whom he had long been acquainted, and who had always expreſſed himſelf in terms of the higheſt friendſhip: that as he never intended to aſk any favour of Mr. Adams for himſelf, I might as well let him try for once to aſk one for me. On my objecting that Mr. Adams's politics and mine were probably very different, Dr. Prieſtley declared that this ſo far from being an objection, might be an inducement in my favor; for if Mr. Adams meant to be the ruler of a nation, inſtead of the leader of a party, he would be glad of an opportunity to exhibit ſuch an inſtance of liberal conduct. At length I conſented, expreſsly requeſting Dr. Prieſtley to take care that Mr. Adams ſhould not miſtake my politics. In conſequence of this converſation Dr. Prieſtley wrote the following letter; not a few months, but above two years ago.</p>

                              <p>It was far from being my intention or wiſh to trouble you with the requeſt of any favours, though it is NOW in your power to grant them; and it is not at all probable that I ſhall ever take a ſecond liberty of the kind. But circumſtances have ariſen which I think call upon me to do it once, though not for myſelf but a friend. The office of agent for American claims was offered I underſtand to Mr. Hall of Sunbury, and he has declined it. If this be the caſe, and no other perſon be yet fixed upon, I ſhall be very happy if I could ſerve Mr. Cooper, a man I doubt not of equal ability and poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of every other qualification for the office, by recommending him. It is true that both he and myſelf fall in the language of our calumniators, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the deſcription of democrats, who are ſtudiouſly repreſented as enemies to what is called GOVERNMENT, both in England and here. What I have done to deſerve that character you well know, and Mr. Cooper has done very little more. In fact we have both been perſecuted for being friends to American liberty, and our preference of the government of this country has brought us both hither. However, were the accuſations true, I think the appointment of a man of unqueſtionable ability and fidelity to his truſt, for which I would make myſelf anſwerable, would be truly ſuch a mark of ſuperiority to popular prejudice as I ſhould expect from you. I therefore think it no unfavorable circumſtance in the recommendation. That you
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037249_0006_100C9CFDC4625080"/>
will act according to your beſt judgment I have no doubt, with reſpect to this and other affairs of infinitely more moment, through which I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded you will bring the country with reputation to yourſelf, though in circumſtances of ſuch uncommon difficulty, perhaps with leſs eaſe and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than I could wiſh. With my earneſt wiſhes for the honour and tranquillity of your preſidency, I am, &amp;c.</p>

If it ſhould ſo happen that I am nominated to that office, I ſhall endeavour to merit the character the doctor has given me, and your eſteem. I am, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Is this the letter of a MAN, or not? I do not appeal to the cowardly propagator of anonymous falſehoods, but to the public. What is there in it, of vanity or ſervility? Do not theſe letters take for granted that I am a democrat, though not a diſturber of all government; and that what I am I ſhall remain, even though it be deemed a <hi>reaſonable objection to my appointment?</hi> Is this, or is this not, adhering to my principle, whatever becomes of my intereſt?</p>
                        <p>Nor is it true that my addreſs originated from any motives of revenge. Two years elapſed from the date of thoſe letters before I wrote any thing on the politics of this country. Nor did I recollect them at the time.— Nor do I ſee the objection to taking any fair means of improving my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. This is a duty incumbent on every prudent man who has a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to raiſe, and which I have already too much neglected from public motives: nor can any office to which I am eligible in this country, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence me for the offers I rejected in its favour. But it is not in the power of promiſes or threats, of wealth or poverty, to extinguiſh the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical enthuſiaſm which has actuated my conduct for theſe twenty years.— The prudence of middle age and the claims of duty may make me cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſacrificing my intereſt, but they cannot induce me to ſacrifice my principle.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nor do I ſee any impropriety in making this requeſt of Mr. Adams. At that time he had juſt entered into office; he was hardly in the infancy of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal miſtake: even thoſe who doubted his capacity, thought well of his intentions.</hi> He had not at that time given the public to underſtand that he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow no office but under implicit conformity to his political opinions. He had not declared that "A Republican Government may mean <hi>any thing</hi>;"
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037249_0007_100C9D00235F9678"/>
he had not yet ſanctioned the abolition of trial by jury in the alien law, or entrenched his public character behind the legal barriers of the ſedition law. <hi>Nor were we yet ſaddled with the expence of a permanent navy, or threatened under his auſpices with the exiſtence of a ſtanding army.

            <p>To this bill of indictment Mr. Cooper put in the plea of <hi>not guilty,</hi> and alſo pleaded the truth of the facts in juſtification. He directed ſubpoenas to be iſſued for the Preſident of the United States, for Timothy Pickering Eſqr. Jacob Wagner, (a clerk in Timothy Pickering's office,) and John Davenport Eſqr. Member of Congreſs. Previous to directing the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poenas', he ſtated to the court, that he underſtood it had been cuſtomary, and was conſidered as a proper practice to prevent any queſtion ariſing on the ſubject of privilege, that when a member of the Legiſlature was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſubpoenaed during ſeſſion, for the court from whence the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poena iſſued, to write to the Speaker of the Houſe requeſting that the Houſe would permit the proceſs to be ſerved.

               <p>I know of no ſuch practice and no ſuch privilege. I do not know that any ſuch privilege is given by the Conſtitution, and if it be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037249_0009_100C9D04223A5440"/>
not given there, I cannot give it. I do not like ſetting precedents of this nature. The court will do its duty, and direct proceſs to be iſſued upon any man whatever his ſituation may be, if the law does not exempt him from it: I ſhall certainly write no ſuch letter.</p>

               <p>I beg leave to ſuggeſt to the court, that the practice of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Speaker in ſuch a caſe was adopted to avoid the difficulty that might ariſe from the claſhing of juriſdictions: If a ſubpoena were ſerved on a member of the Legiſlatue during ſeſſion, and he did not chooſe to attend, the next proceſs of the court (if prayed for,) muſt be attachment; and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be enforced without arreſt: But the members of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are privileged from arreſt during ſeſſion.</p>

               <p>Sir, the court thank you for your ſuggeſtion as Amicus Curiae; but we ſhould take care to avoid this claſhing of juriſdictions. If the member ſubpoenaed during the ſeſſion would not attend, we would iſſue no attachment, we would put off the cauſe till his attendance could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. Mr. Cooper may take out his ſubpoena's, we ſhall write no ſuch letter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge Peters.</speaker>
               <p>I wiſh it to be underſtood that in my opinion, no ſuch proceſs ought to iſſue to members of the Legiſlature during ſeſſion; for I do not approve of iſſuing proceſs which we cannot enforce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cooper on coming into the court on Wedneſday morning (the time appointed for bringing on the trial,) enquired if his ſubpoena's had been ſerved, and particularly the ſubpoena directed to the Preſident of the United States.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Judge Chace.</speaker>
               <p>No Sir; the clerk of the court ſhewed us your directions to him, to ſubpoena the Preſident of the United States, and we directed him not to iſſue the ſubpoena; we thought the proceeding very improper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cooper.</speaker>
               <p>Will the Court have the goodneſs to hear rne on that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion?</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cooper.</speaker>
               <p>I did not expect (may it pleaſe the court) that any objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have been made to iſſuing this proceſs to procure the attendance of the Preſident. It is the duty of every good citizen for the furtherance of juſtice, to give his teſtimony when duly called upon for that purpoſe by the proceſs of a court of juſtice. Before I determined on applying for this ſubpoena, I examined (as it was my duty to do) the Conſtitution of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, to diſcover if any privilege of exemption from this proceſs was given to the Preſident by that Conſtitution: I could find none; If the the gentleman whoſe duty it is to conduct this proſecution, or the court will be kind enough to point out any ſuch exemption, I ſhall moſt willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract my error; but if the Conſtitution and the laws of our country confer no ſuch privilege on the Preſident, it is not in the power of this court to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what they have omitted: notwithſtanding the application to the court on
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037249_0010_100C9D070C0DFFA0"/>
Monday laſt, for a letter to the Speaker, proceeded from myſelf, I was glad to hear the opinion of your Honour that you would not undertake to confer privileges which the Conſtitution had not granted: if no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption then can be claimed in your opinion by any member of our Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, why ſhould it be aſſumed by the Preſident? if the Conſtitution does not give him this privilege of exemption, I may claim the ſubpoena as a matter of right.</p>
               <p>There is a farther and a peculiar reaſon in this cauſe, why the Preſident even if he had this privilege ſhould not claim it as againſt myſelf; if I call him into this court, who compels me to do it? Himſelf. Who has he to blame for the trouble I may occaſion him by his attendance here? Himſelf. The publication for which I am indicted is not a voluntary effuſion, it was forced from me—I was compelled to write it in vindication of my own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, groſſly and falſely attacked in conſequence of a diſcloſure on the part of the Preſident, of what I cannot but deem private correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is from information then, proceeding directly or indirectly from himſelf, that I was firſt compelled to appear before the public, and am now dragged into this court to vindicate my character againſt anonymous ſlander and legal accuſation.—If for no other, for <hi>this</hi> reaſon may it pleaſe the court, in my opinion the Preſident <hi>ought</hi> to appear. Nor in ſuch a country as this, do I ſee why this exemption ſhould be granted to one man and not to another. This is, and I hope, will long continue a republican country. A government of equal rights and equal Laws.—But the privilege now claimed is out of harmony with theſe equal principles of republican gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and I hope the deciſion of the court in the preſent caſe, will author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize us to believe that no man in this country, is poſſeſſed of a ſituation ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated as to be above the Laws, or of any privileges paramount to juſtice.</p>

               <p>We have heard you Sir; patiently; and in conſideration of your being without counſel, we have permitted you to ſay what we would not have ſuffered any counſel to advance: Sir, we conſider your ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, but you have totally miſtaken the whole buſineſs. It is not upon the objection of privilege that we have refuſed this ſubpoena: This court will do its duty againſt any man however elevated his ſituation may be.— You have miſtaken the ground.—We are of opinion that in the caſe of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for a libel tending to bring the Preſident of the United States into contempt, <hi>he</hi> cannot be compelled to appear at all. What? ſhall you bring the Preſident on ſuch an proſecution, into this court to prove your charges? to aſk him, <hi>did</hi> you do ſo and ſo? were you guilty of maladmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration? Sir, this cannot be permitted, and if you had been a lawyer you would not have made the requeſt.</p>

            <sp>

            <p>The Jury were then called, but before they were ſworn, Mr. Cooper ſuggeſted to the court that ſome of the paſſages charged in the indictment were grounded upon certain addreſſes to the Preſident in the ſummer of one thouſand ſeven hundred and nintey-eight, and the anſwers thereto; that he had applied to Mr. Rawle to admit as evidence of thoſe documents, the publications of them in the common news-papers; that he meant to uſe Fenno's paper for the purpoſe; that Mr. Rawle at firſt conſented, but had ſince written him a note retracting that aſſent, that if the court ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide when the cauſe had gone half thro, that ſuch evidence on the part of the defendant was inadmiſſible, he would be compelled to move the court to put off the cauſe till he could procure the beſt evidence, the nature of the caſe would admit of, and which Mr. Rawle ſeemed to inſiſt on, namely official copies of thoſe documents.</p>

               <p>When the queſtion comes before us we will cconſider it. In the mean time you muſt go on your own way and judge for yourſelf.

                  <hi>Mr. Cooper</hi> addreſſed the court as follows,</speaker>
               <p>The court may perhaps remember the propoſals I made to the Attorney General reſpecting ſome public documents, which I meant to give in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as they were publiſhed in a news-paper wherein all the acts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were uſually inſerted: that paper was Fenno's United States Gazette. The Attorney General <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Rawle did not underſtand at firſt as he afterwards informed me, that I meant to uſe Fenno's papar, or he would have admitted it.</note> thought it his duty to object to this kind of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſince either from deſign or inaccuracy, miſtakes might take place in the publications.</p>
               <p>I was extremely deſirous at that time to have met the charge ſubſtantially; the court however, thought Mr. Rawle might inſiſt on my producing official copies of ſuch documents as were neceſſary for my defence.</p>
               <p>In conformity to this expectation, I have endeavoured to procure thoſe copies without delay. Much of the ſuppoſed libel is founded on expreſſions contained in certain addreſſes to the Preſident in the ſummer of one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-eight, and his anſwers thereto. On the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity therefore of the caſe of the King vs. Holt, in 5th. term, reports page 442. I applied by letter to the Secretary of State, who returned for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the next morning that there were none of thoſe addreſſes or anſwers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in his office; on receiving this information I ſent directly the following note to the Preſident,

               <p>I preſume there is the ſame law for Mr. Rawle as for me, and as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the production of news-paper evidence in the firſt inſtance, ſo may I, on the ſame grounds: therefore I move the court to put off the trial until I can procure the papers required.</p>

               <p>You are miſtaken in ſuppoſing the proſecutor of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment is the Preſident of the United States. It is no ſuch thing.—It is at the ſuit of the United States you are indicted, for publiſhing a falſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and malicious libel, with intent to defame the Preſident of the United States.—Nor do I underſtand that the Attorney General objected to your producing the teſtimony you mentioned.—But your miſtakes muſt fall on yourſelf.—You muſt take the chance.—Nor had you a right to make theſe aſſertions unleſs you had proof that would bear you out in them.</p>
               <p>If in making thoſe aſſertions you relied on the public papers it was at your own riſk; and it was your own fault not to have had authentic copies.

               <p>You ſuppoſe that the offices of government ought to be open to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection—it is not ſo—even if you had theſe copies the court would deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on their admiſſibility as evidence.

            <p>W. RAWLE, Attorney General Began by obſerving that the Defendant ſtands charged with attempts which the practice and policy of all civilized nations has thought it right all times to puniſh with ſeverity. With having publiſhed a falſe ſcandalous and malicious attack on the character of the Preſident of the United States with an intent to excite the hatred and contempt of the people of this country againſt the man of their choice.</p>
            <p>It was much to be lamented that every perſon who had a tolerable facility at writing ſhould think he had a right to attack and overſet thoſe authorities and officers whom the people of this country had thought fit to appoint. Nor was it to be endured that foul and infamous falſehoods ſhould be uttered and publiſhed with impunity againſt the Preſident of the United States, whom the people themſelves had placed in that high office, and in which he has acted with ſo much credit to himſelf and benefit to them. Thomas Cooper ſtands charged in the indictment as follows—(here the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney General read the indictment) It was a ſenſe of public duty that called for this proſecution. It was neceſſary that an example ſhould be made to deter others from miſleading the people by ſuch falſe and defamatory publications. There was a peculiarity in the manner alſo of this publication; we generally obſerve that perſons who take theſe liberties, endeavour to avoid puniſhment by ſheltering themſelves under fictitious ſignatures or by concealing their names; but the Defendant acted very differently. Being of the profeſſion of the law, a man of education and literature, he availed himſelf of thoſe advantages for the purpoſe of diſſeminating his dangerous productions in a remote part of the country where he had gained influence. Such conduct muſt have ariſen from the baſeſt motives. It would be proved to the Jury that at the time of this publication, the Defendant went to a magiſtrate and acknowledged it to be his production in the ſame formal manner as if it had been a deed.</p>
            <p>A conduct ſo groſsly improper, had occurred in no inſtance within his recollection and the manner conſtituted no ſlight aggravation of the offence.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037249_0016_100C9D13EEF06350"/>
Indeed it was high time for the law to interfere and reſtrain the libellous ſpirit which had been ſo long permitted to extend itſelf againſt the higheſt and moſt deſerving characters.</p>
            <p>To abuſe the men with whom the public has entruſted the management of their national concerns, to withdraw from them the confidence of the people, ſo neceſſary for conducting the public buſineſs, was in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the duties of a good citizen. Miſchiefs of this kind were to be dreaded in proportion as the country around is leſs informed, and a man of ſenſe and education has it more in his power to extend the miſchief which he is inclined to propagate. Government ſhould not encourage the idea, that they would not proſecute ſuch atrocious conduct, for if this conduct was allowed to paſs over, the peace of the country would be endangered.</p>
            <p>Error leads to diſcontent, diſcontent to a fancied idea of oppreſſion, and that to inſurrection, of which the two inſtances which had already happened, were alarming proofs, and well known to the jury.</p>
            <p>That the jury, as citizens, muſt determine whether from publications of this kind the proſperity of the country was not endangered; and whether it was not their duty, when a caſe of this nature was laid before them and the law was applicable, to bring in ſuch a verdict as the law and the evidence would warrant; and ſhew, that theſe kind of attacks on the government of the country, were not to be ſuffered with impunity.</p>

            <p>MR. COOPER's DEFENCE:</p>
            <sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it were true, as it is not true, that in the language of the attorney general of the diſtrict, I have been guilty of publiſhing with the baſeſt motives a foul and infamous libel on the character of the Preſident; of exciting againſt him the hatred and contempt of the people of this country, by groſs and malicious falſehoods—then indeed would it be his duty to bring me before this Tribunal, it would be yours to convict, and the duty of the court to puniſh me. But I hope in the courſe of this trial, I ſhall be enabled to prove to your ſatisfaction, that I have publiſhed nothing which truth will not juſtify. That the aſſertions for which I am indicted are free from malicious imputation: and that my motives have been honeſt and fair.</p>
               <p>You will obſerve, <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi> that the law requires it to be proved as a neceſſary part of the charge, that the paſſages for which I am indicted ſhould be falſe and ſcandalous, and publiſhed from malicious motives: and before you will be able, conſiſtently with your oaths, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict upon this indictment, you muſt be thoroughly ſatisfied that both theſe parts of the charge are well founded. Nor does it appear to me that the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037249_0018_100C9D19095271B0"/>
expreſſion of the act, to bring the Preſident into contempt, can be fulfilled if the accuſation, as in the preſent inſtance, related to an examination of his <hi>public</hi> conduct, and no improper motives are imputed to him. And that I have carefully avoided imputing any impropriety of intention to the Preſident even in the very paper complained of—that the uniform tenor of my conduct and language has been to attribute honeſty of motive even where I have ſtrongly diſapproved of, the tendency of his meaſures, I can abundantly ſhew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi> you, and all who hear me, well know that this country is divided, and almoſt equally divided, into two grand parties; uſually termed, whether properly or improperly, <hi>Federaliſts</hi> and <hi>Anti-Feder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts</hi>: and that the governing powers of the country, are ranked in public opinion under the former denomination—of theſe diviſions, the one wiſhes to increaſe, the other to diminiſh the powers of the Executive; the one thinks that the people, (the Democracy of the country) has too much, the other, too little influence on the meaſures of government: the one is friendly, the other hoſtile, to a ſtanding army and a permanent Navy: the one thinks them neceſſary to repel invaſions and aggreſſions from without, and commotions within; the other, that a well organized Militia is a ſufficient ſafeguard for all that an army could protect, and that a navy is more dangerous and expenſive than any benefit derived from it can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate: the one, thinks the liberties of our country endangered by the licentiouſneſs, the other, by the reſtrictions on the Preſs: Such are ſome among the leading features of theſe notorious diviſions of political party. It is evident, Gentlemen of the Jury, that each will view with a jealous eye the poſitions of the other, and that there cannot but be a bias among the partizans of the one ſide, againſt the principles and doctrines inculcated by the other. In the preſent inſtance I fear it cannot but have its effect: For without impeaching the integrity of any perſon directly concerned in the progreſs of the preſent trial, I may fairly ſtate, that under the Sedition Law, a defendant, ſuch as I ſtand before you, is placed in a ſituation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in any other caſe.</p>
               <p>Directly or indirectly, the public, if not the private character of the Preſident of the United States is involved in the preſent trial. Who nominates the judges who are to preſide? the juries who are to judge of the evidence? the Marſhal who has the ſummoning of the jury? the Preſident. Suppoſe a caſe of arbitration concerning the property of any one of you, where the adverſe party ſhould claim the right of nominating the perſons whoſe legal opinions are to decide the law of the queſtion, and of the very man who ſhall have the appointment of the arbitrators? what would you ſay to ſuch a trial? and yet in fact ſuch is mine, and ſuch is the trial of every man who has the misfortune to be indicted under this law. But although I have a right to preſume ſomething of political bias againſt my opinions, from the court who try me, to you who ſit there as jurymen, I am ſtill ſatisfied you will feel, that you have ſome ſome character to ſupport and ſome character to loſe; and whatever your opinions may be on the ſubjects alluded to in the indictment, you will reverence as you ought the ſacred obligation of the oath you have taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi> I acknowlege as freely as any of you can, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a certain degree of confidence in the executive Government of the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037249_0019_100C9D1AE80FCC60"/>
Country. But this confidence ought not to be unlimitted, and need not be paid up in advance; let it be earned before it be repoſed; let it be claimed by the evidence of benefits conferred, of meaſures that compell approbation, of conduct irreproachable.—It cannot be exacted by the guarded proviſions of Sedition Laws, by attacks on the Freedom of the Preſs, by proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pains, and penalties on thoſe which boldly expreſs the truth, or who may honeſtly and innocently err in their political ſentiments.—Let this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired confidence be the meed of deſert, and the public will not be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to pay it.</p>
               <p>But in the preſent ſtate of affairs, the Preſs is open to thoſe who will praiſe, while the threats of the Law hang over thoſe who blame the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the men in power.—Indiſcriminate approbation of the meaſures of the executive, is not only unattacked, but foſtered and received with the utmoſt avidity.—While thoſe who venture to expreſs a ſentiment of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt do it in fear and trembling, and run the hazard of being dragged like myſelf before the frowning tribunal, erected by the Sedition Law.— Be it ſo; but ſurely this anxiety to protect public character, muſt ariſe from fear of attack.—That conduct which will not bear inveſtigation will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſhun it; and whether my opinions are right or wrong as they are ſtated in the charge, I cannot help thinking they would have been better confuted by evidence and argument than by indictment.—Fines and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, will produce conviction neither in the mind of the ſufferer, nor of the public.</p>
               <p>Nor do I ſee how the people can exerciſe on rational grounds their elective franchiſe, if perfect freedom of diſcuſſion of public characters be not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—Electors are bound in conſcience to reflect and decide who beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves their ſuffrages; but how can they do it, if theſe proſecutions in <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> cloſe all the avenues of information, and throw a veil over the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſconduct of our periodical rulers.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>
               <p>After having offered theſe preliminary remarks, I ſhall give an account of the paper on which I am accuſed, and then proceed to examine the charges of the indictment in the order in which they are laid: much that I intended to have advanced I muſt relinquiſh, that I may not treſpaſs too long on your time, or weaken the effect of my own defence by fatiguing your attention.</p>
               <p>The ſcored paper now handed to me by the attorney-general, ſuggeſts an obſervation, which, though trite, is material. Upon the plan uſually adopted in theſe <hi>ex officio</hi> accuſations, a good Chriſtian might eaſily be proved an arrant atheiſt. "The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God." Take the four laſt words and they are atheiſtical: take the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and it is ſcripture. So, take the marked paſſages in this paper and they may perhaps be forced into ſomething like improper imputation againſt the preſident: take the paper itſelf, and the very firſt paragraph is a plain and poſitive approbation of his intention. Though I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that however upright I might formerly have believed his motives of action, I cannot upon reflection, pay that tribute to his conduct or his motives on the preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>The general circumſtances that gave riſe to the paper I now hold are
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037249_0020_100C9D1CE7392B10"/>
theſe: Dr. Prieſtley, a man whoſe name implies a greater combination of learning, ſcience, and ability, of important diſcovery, of exertion for the benefit of mankind, and of private integrity, than any other man now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can boaſt—whoſe conduct towards me in the inſtance detailed in this paper is praiſe ſufficient to bear up my mind againſt any conſequences which the preſent trial can produce—had long been an acquaintance and an intimate acquaintance of Mr. Adams in England and in this country. The letters of the latter to dr. Prieſtley are full of ſtrong expreſſions of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and eſteem. Relying upon this long intercourſe of cordiality between them, dr. Prieſtley urged me to permit him to write to Mr. Adams on the ſubject of a vacancy mentioned in this paper, and which as you will have it before you when you retire, I ſhall not read at length. This appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was from one friend to another; upon the face of it a confidential communication; although containing nothing but what might do credit to all the parties concerned. Mr. Adams, however, did not think it ſo confidential; and from ſome diſcloſure on his part has been founded the baſe and cowardly ſlander which dragged me in the firſt inſtance before the public in vindication of my moral and political character, and has at length dragged me before this tribunal, to protect, if I can, my perſonal liberty and my private fortune againſt the legal attack of an <hi>ex officio</hi> information. Hence it is evident, gentlemen of the jury, that this is not a voluntary, but an involuntary publication on my part: it has originated not from motives of turbulence and malice, but from ſelf-defence; not from a deſire of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking the character of the preſident, but of vindicating my own. And in what way have I done this? My motives, my private character, my public character, were the object of falſehood and calumny, apparently founded on information of high authority. In reply, I give credit to the intentions of the preſident, I ſay nothing of his private character, and I attack only the tendency of meaſures notorious to the world, which having been known to diſapprove publicly, I was charged with being ready from motives of intereſt, to approve privately. I think, gentlemen, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help feeling this contraſt of behaviour, and if the preſident is ſatisfied with his ſide of the picture I am with mine.</p>
               <p>The FIRST article ſelected for accuſation is, that at the time I allude to, <hi>he was but in the infancy of political miſtake.</hi> Why this expreſſion ſhould have been fixed on as ſeditious I know not, unleſs it be that <hi>quem deus vult perdere prius dementat;</hi> for have we advanced ſo far on the road to deſpotiſm in this republican country, that we dare not ſay our Preſident may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken? Is a plain citizen encircled at once by the myſterious attribute of political infallibility the inſtant he mounts the preſidential chair? If ſo, then indeed may it be ſeditious to ſay he is miſtaken; but before you can condemn me for this kind of ſedition you muſt become catholic believers in this new-fangled doctrine of infallibility. I know that in England the king can do no wrong, but I did not know till now that the Preſident of the United States had the ſame attribute.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid (and I am accuſed for ſaying it) "<hi>that even thoſe who doubted his capacity thought well of his intentions.</hi>" Is it a crime to doubt the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Preſident? Suppoſe I had ſaid that there were ſome who did not give him credit for capacity ſufficient for the office he holds, is that a crime? Or if in them, is it a crime in me, who have not ſaid it? Nor can
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037249_0021_100C9D1EF2EAF150"/>
the word <hi>capacity</hi> here be fairly conſtrued into any other than a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive meaning; for ſurely no one who has read his Defence, as it is called, of the American Conſtitution, or who reflects that he has had abilities enough to raiſe himſelf to his preſent ſituation, can ſay that he is devoid ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of induſtry or talents. But thoſe who voted for his opponent muſt have believed Mr. Adams of inferior capacity to that gentleman. Of that number was I; of that number was <hi>at leaſt</hi> one-half of the people of the United States. If it be a crime thus to have thought and thus to have ſpoken, I fear I ſhall continue in this reſpect incorrigible. But if of two conſtructions the one is abſurd, improbable and unfavorable, ſurely it ſhould be rejected in favour of that meaning which was moſt likely to have occurred, and which in its effects will do leaſt injury to a defendant like myſelf. This is common, this is legal charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor had we yet under his auſpices, been ſaddled with the expence of a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent navy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen is it true or not that we are ſaddled with the expence of a permanent navy? Is it neceſſary that I ſhould enter into a detail of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to prove that the ſun ſhines at noon day? But farther, is it true that we incur this expence under his auſpices and ſanction?</p>
               <p>I have before me two publications, the one the Gazette of the United States, publiſhed by Mr. Fenno in this city; and another in a form more portable and convenient, purporting to be a ſelection of addreſſes and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to and from the Preſident during the ſummer of 1798. Not having been able to procure office copies of the documents I wiſhed to refer to, I muſt offer in evidence ſuch publications as I can find; that claſs of publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, upon which in fact the mind of the public is uſually made up; and upon whoſe authority the electors of this country determine the characters whom they honour with their ſuffrage. Indeed if the opinion that fell from the court this morning be accurate, that no man ſhould hazzard an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion but upon ſufficient and legal evidence, and if documents from the public offices in proof of notorious facts are required as ſuch evidence, then are the mouths of the people compleatly ſhut up on every queſtion of public conduct or public character: but I cannot help thinking it a fair and reaſonable poſition, that a defendant in ſuch a caſe as this ſhould be permitted to offer to the jury any evidence that appears to him a ſufficient ground for his aſſertion, and let them decide on its credibility.</p>

               <speaker>Judge Chace.</speaker>
               <p>What is it that you ſay ſir fell from the court? They have not yet decided what was or what not proper evidence for you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. The court ſaid if you thought the public documents at your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you were miſtaken. If you undertake to publiſh without having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per evidence before you to juſtify your aſſertions, you do it at your own riſk. Moſt aſſuredly in common traverſes you could not offer the evidence you mention. But we acknowledge that in ſuch a caſe as this greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude may be given. If you ſay the preſident did write a letter you muſt prove it. We ſhould incline to admit gazettes and acts of public autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and notoriety: you might read the ſpeech of the Preſident to both houſes of congreſs in evidence. If you want to prove that the Preſident advocated a navy, you may read the journals of congreſs or any authentic public document.</p>

I muſt offer ſuch evidence as I can procure; and where there is no reaſonable ſuſpicion or aſſignable motive why the publications I offer ſhould miſrepreſent the tranſactions I allude to, the probability is in favour of their accuracy; eſpecially when the printers of them are ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable for wilful miſrepreſentation or groſs miſtake in detailing the public acts of government.</p>

<q>Floating bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and wooden walls have been my favourite ſyſtem of warfare and defence for this country for TWENTY-THREE years. I have had very little ſucceſs in making proſelytes. At the preſent moment how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Americans in general, cultivators as well as merchants and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, begin to look to that ſource of ſecurity and protection, and your aſſiſtance will have great influence and effect in extending the opinion in theory, and introducing and eſtabliſhing the practice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe is the anſwer of the Preſident to the young men of Boſton.
<q>To arms then my young friends, to arms: eſpecially by ſea, to be uſed as the law ſhall direct let us reſort; for ſafety againſt dangers which we now ſee cannot be averted by truth, reaſon or juſtice.</q>
Pat. add. p. 38.</p>
               <p>In uniſon with theſe opinions of the Preſident the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Stoddart, preſented a report to congreſs early the next ſeſſion (2d Jan. 1799) recommending (p. 1) a navy of 12 ſeventy-fours, as many frigates, and twenty or thirty ſmaller veſſels: in another part (p. 2 and 16) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended an addition of 12 ſeventy-fours to the exiſting eſtabliſhment.— Some of the reaſons given by Mr. Stoddart deſerve our moſt ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The paſſages I allude to are theſe. Rep. p. <hi>2.</hi>
                        <q>Whether this ſecurity can be afforded unleſs we are able to command our own coaſt; and whether the union of all the ſtates can long be preſerved without it, are queſtions that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the moſt ſerious and attentive conſideration of American legiſlators. I forbear to a well on this fruitful, perhaps <hi>delicate</hi> topic.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>P. <hi>3.</hi> Thus then, whether our object be to prevent invaſion—to protect our commerce—to obtain a ſpeedy and proper peace—to maintain peace hereafter— or by affording ſecurity to every part of our country, to guard againſt the long train of ills <hi>which muſt reſult from diſunion,</hi>
                        </q>
&amp;c.</p>
                  </note>
Surely after theſe ſtatements it will not be denied that our navy is eſtabliſhed under the ſanction, not to ſay expreſs recommendation of the Preſident.</p>
               <p>In the paſſage thus indicted, there is no expreſſion of blame againſt the meaſure, nor any imputation of improper motive or conduct to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on account of it: but I ſcorn this ſubterfuge of conſtruction: I <hi>did</hi> mean when I wrote it to imply a diſapprobation of the meaſure: I thought it objectionable at the time; I think ſo ſtill. I have elſewhere<note n="†" place="bottom">Political arithmetic, publiſhed by Campbell, Philadelphia.</note> ſtated my reaſons for this diſapprobation, and why we are protecting our commerce

at double its worth: I ſhall not therefore detail my reaſons for this opinion, but appeal to you, gentlemen of the jury, if I have the misfortune of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in opinion with the Preſident on this ſubject, as wiſer heads have done before me, whether I ought to be indicted and puniſhed for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement. Our opinions are not in our own power; they are the inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſult of ſuch evidence and argument as we happen to light upon: at all events, let me aſk, have I proved the facts as ſtated or not? If I have, you cannot find me guilty conſiſtently with the law that has been read to you, or the oaths you have taken.</p>
               <p>It is farther imputed to me as a crime, that I have ſaid, <hi>under the auſpices of the Preſident we are threatened with the exiſtence of a ſtanding army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I feel it very difficult to prove facts ſo notorious as thoſe I am charged with aſſerting. Gentlemen of the jury, have we or have we not a ſtanding army? Is it or is it not ſanctioned with the approbation of the Preſident? Independent of his official approbation giving to our mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tary eſtabliſhment, he has certainly expreſſed himſelf voluntarily much in favour of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Is his reply to the addreſs of the young men of Boſton, pat. add. p. 37, he ſays, that
<q>this country never appeared to him to be in greater danger than at that moment from within or without—never more ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently excited to aſſume the functions of ſoldiers.</q>
And to the ſtudents of Dickinſon College, pat. add. 240, he hopes, that none but thoſe who feel a natural genius and diſpoſition to martial exerciſe "and exertions will ever be called from the field of ſcience," &amp;c. Theſe are certainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his approbation of a military force diſtinct from the militia; evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences confirmed by the repeated official ſtatements and reports<note n="*" place="bottom">The report of Colonel M'Henry to the Preſident, of December <hi>24, 1798,</hi> and by him recommended to the conſideration of congreſs, contemplates an army of <hi>50,000</hi> men, to put us on ſafe ground. I ſhall extract from the report of Colonel M'Henry of <hi>5</hi>th January to the Preſident and the <hi>13</hi>th of February, <hi>1800</hi> to congreſs, hereafter.</note> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent executive department on the ſame ſubject. Without his approbation we could not have had a ſtanding army, and to the inhabitants of our towns and villages who have eyes and ears, no farther proof than the uſe of them is neceſſary that we have one.</p>
               <p>This meaſure, like the former, I certainly meant to inculpate; and if I moſt ſincerely diſapprove it, I ſhall not hold an opinion unconfirmed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern hiſtory, or by teſtimonies of weight among the dead and the living, whoſe authority Mr. Adams himſelf will not diſallow. Is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me, gentlemen of the jury, to enumerate the many governments in ancient and modern hiſtory called republics, which a ſtanding military force has overthrown, and converted into deſpotiſms?<note n="†" place="bottom">Timotheus overthrew the liberties of Corinth; Agathocles of Syracuſe; Piſiſtratus of Athens, Marius and Sylla, with their contending armies deluged Rome in blood.

Are we ourſelves unacquainted with the inconveniences attending them, or are the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar objections to a ſtanding army in ſuch a country as ours ſo deep and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult as to require diffuſe illuſtration? I think not; I think I may ſafely venture to truſt to your recollection of recent events in ſupport of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation, I certainly meant to caſt on a ſtanding army in any form, or to any extent, or on any pretence, except perhaps the dubious neceſſity of actual invaſion.</p>
               <p>General Waſhington, whoſe opinions every man who hears me will liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to with reſpectful attention, was a decided enemy of theſe kind of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary eſtabliſhments. In his ſpeech to both houſes of congreſs, December 1793, he apologizes thus for having recommended certain meaſures of a military nature:
<q>Nor can ſuch arrangements with ſuch objects be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the cenſure or the jealouſy of the warmeſt friends of republican government. They are incapable of abuſe in the hands of a MILITIA, who ought to poſſeſs a pride in being the depoſitory of the force of the republic, <hi>and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military emergency of the United States.</hi>
                  </q>
Again—In that laſt and moſt delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate act of his moſt uſeful life, his <hi>farewell addreſs</hi> to his countrymen, he expreſſes himſelf thus—
<q>
                     <hi>Hence likewiſe they will avoid the neceſſity of thoſe overgrown military eſtabliſhments which under</hi> any form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are inauſpicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hoſtile to republican liberty.</q>
Such are the ſentiments of general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington toward the cloſe of a public life that gave him pec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> Nor has Mr. Adams himſelf been at all times ſo favourable as he ſeems to be at preſent to the modern ſyſtem of ſtanding armies. "We have ſeen," ſays he, (alluding to England)
<q>one of the firſt nations in Europe, poſſeſſed of ample and fertile territories at home, and extenſive dominions abroad, of a commerce with the whole world, immenſe wealth, and the greateſt naval power which ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to any nation, who have ſtill preſerved the power of the people by the equilibrium we have been contending for, by the trial by jury, <hi>and by conſtantly refuſing a ſtanding army.</hi> The people of England alone, by preſerving their ſhare in the legiſlature, at the expence of the blood of heroes and patriots, have enabled their kings to curb the nobility <hi>without giving him a ſtanding army.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Adams is certainly more accurate in his theory than his facts. It is ſurpriſing to me that any man can have read the hiſtory of England, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the quarrels between the monarchs of that country and the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, from William the Third, to George the Third; the various proteſts of the minorities in the houſe of lords on the ſubject of ſtanding armies; the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Cato's Letters, and the Tracts of Gordon and Trenchard, and yet aſſert that there was no ſtanding army in England at the time the above paſſage was written. Did not Mr. Adams know that the ſoldiery in England are enliſted for life, although the mutiny bill is annual, and the appropriations annual?</note>

                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:037249_0025_100C9D2700289E70"/>Hence then we ſee that whatever the Preſident may be now, the time has been when he was not an advocate for a ſtanding army; if the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent has thought fit to change his opinion, ſtill I hope it is no crime in me, to have retained mine. The next charge, is that which reſpects <hi>the project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Embaſſies to Pruſſia, Ruſſia and the Sublime Porte.</hi> Mr. Pickering who is on the bench with the court, can prove the perſons appointed, the date of their appointment, and their ſalaries. But this will be to occupy time in proving a matter of notoriety, and I feel now diſinclined to enter into all the details of concluſion which the facts he could tell us would lead me to. I have much yet to go through; I feel the effect of interruption, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without reſorting to his teſtimony, I ſhall obſerve very briefly in the firſt place, that the obvious tendency of theſe appointments, beſide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for thoſe who are nominated to them, is to put us in a way of being drawn into the vortex of European politics and European quarrels, with which we have nothing to do: 2dly. That they are commercially uſeleſs; the commerce of this country to thoſe places does not furniſh profit enough to pay the expenſes of cur diplomatic and conſular eſtabliſhments there. 3dly. That they have hitherto produced no national benefit whatever, ſo far as the the public yet know; and 4thly. I am, as a citizen of this country, a ſincere convert to the doctrine of General Waſhington in his <hi>farewell addreſs.</hi> Hear his words:
<q>The firſt rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little <hi>political</hi> connexion as poſſible; ſo far as we have formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith: <hi>here let us ſtop.</hi> Europe has a ſet of primary intereſts, which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence ſhe muſt be engaged in frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, the cauſes of which are eſſentially foreign to our concerns. Hence therefore it muſt be unwiſe in us to implicate ourſelves by artificial ties in the ordinary viciſſitudes of her politics, or in the ordinary combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and colliſions of her friendſhips or enmities,</q>
again:
<q>why forego the advantages of ſo peculiar a ſituation? why quit our own ſtand upon foreign ground? why by interweaving our deſtiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and proſperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalſhip, intereſt, humour or caprice. 'Tis our true policy to ſteer clear of all permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world: ſo far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be underſtood as capable of patronizing infidelity to exiſting engagements. But in my opinion it would be unwiſe to extend them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here then, Gentlemen of the Jury, do I ſtand before you, indicted for being an advocate for the doctrines, ſolemnly and deliberately recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his fellow citizens, by GEORGE WASHINGTON.</p>
               <p>But <hi>we have borrowed money</hi> ſays this paper of mine, <hi>at</hi> 8 <hi>per cent in time of peace.</hi>—Have we or have we not? If we have, am I guilty of a crime in making the aſſertion? or can you really deem it neceſſary that I ſhould adduce proof to eſtabliſh this fact? But perhaps Mr. Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may ſay, I meant to imply a cenſure on the Preſident for his ſanction to this meaſure: I did ſo.—I think the cauſes of the Loan, the meaſures that produced it, had a tendency unfavourable to the intereſt of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: I have already urged what I had to ſay on our permanent navy, and our ſtanding army, and therefore I ſhall not repeat the objections.—I think
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037249_0026_100C9D2925C07590"/>
the loan was extravagant, for in no period of war do I recollect that Great Britain has ever offered this high intereſt. I think the intereſt thus given improper, as a ſanctioning of uſury by Government, while our laws repreſs it individually, I dread the principles of all Loans; for I abhor a funding ſyſtem and a national debt.—If thus to think be a crime, I muſt patiently abide the puniſhment.—Nor do I ſee why this expence ſhould have been made neceſſary by any previous meaſures, while the ſtate of our finances was ſo unfriendly to any expenditure that could have been avoided.—If Mr. Gallatins book on the finances of this country, be not authority, it ought to be.—In page 48 and the ſubſequent pages of that book, you may find that about the time when General Waſhington declined and Mr. Adams ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Preſidency, our receipt and expenditures about balanced each other; they were in round numbers 6½ million of dollars per annum. I hold now in my hand the report of the committee of ways and means of February 21ſt. 1800, publiſhed by order of the houſe of Repreſentatives of Congreſs, from page 15 whereof it appears that the eſtimated revenue for the year 1800, is only 9,301,258 dollars, while the eſtimated expence is 15,393,034<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaving a deficiency of above 6 million of dollars! As the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of borrowing at 8 per cent is now ſet; time only can ſhew us how much of this alarming deficiency is to be made up by ſuch loans, at this enormous intereſt. If this be the price of borrowing in time of peace what will be the intereſt demanded in a period of war! Is this giving a proof of our ſtrength, or of our weakneſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This money was borrowed when the violence of official expreſſions might have provoked a war.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi> the court will concede that Vattel's Treatiſe on the Law of Nations, is a book of acknowledged authority: and from that book I will read a quotation or two.
<q>Nothing is more oppoſite to the duties of humanity nor more contrary to the ſociety which ſhould be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by nations, than offences or actions which give a juſt diſpleaſure to others. Every Nation therefore ſhould carefully avoid giving any real offence: I ſay a real; for ſhould he who manifeſts a diſpleaſure at our behaviour when we are only uſing our rights or fulfilling our duties, he is to blame, not we. Offences excite ſuch aſperity and rancour between nations, that we ſhould avoid giving room even for ill grounded offences, when it can be done without any inconveniency or failure in our duty. It is ſaid that ſome medals and dull jeſts, were what irritated Lewis XIV againſt the United Provinces, and were the chief ceaſe of his expedition in 1672, by which that Republic was brought to the brink of ruin.</q>
L. 2. Ch. 1. § 19.</p>
               <p>Again, L. 3. Ch. 4. § 65.
<q>In ſo civilized an age, it may be unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to obſerve, that in theſe pieces, publiſhed on account of a war, all opprobrious words are to be avoided, together with every expreſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating hatred, animoſity, and rage, as theſe can only excite the like ſentiments in the enemy. A prince, both in his diſcourſes and in his writings, ought to obſerve the moſt noble decency. He is to reſpect himſelf in the perſon of his equals: and though it is his misfortune to be at variance with a nation, ſhall he inflame the quarrel by offenſive expreſſions, and thus deprive himſelf of the hopes of a ſincere reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Homer's heroes called each other dog and drunkard, and in their
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037249_0027_100C9D2B6C8D1338"/>
wars they obſerve no manner of decorum, they were filled with the moſt brutal outrages. Frederick Barbaroſſa with other Emperors, and the Popes their enemies, treated each other with the ſame roughneſs and violence. Let us congratulate our age on the ſuperior gentleneſs of its manners, and not deny us an empty politeneſs, cuſtoms which have conſequences truly beneficial.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far Vattel; and I moſt ſincerely wiſh it were in my power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate my fellow citizens of America, and the adminiſtration of our country, with having uniformly preſerved that tone of ſuperior gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and beneficial politeneſs, ſo wiſely recommended by our author.</p>
               <p>But I have no ſuch congratulations to make; and it is to me a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant taſk to detail, though in my own defence, thoſe official expreſſions on the part of the Preſident, which have given undoubted cauſe (and in my opinion juſt cauſe) of offence to France. I ſhall paſs by the abberations from decorum of language which I might quote from the documents of ſecondary officers, and confine myſelf however unpleaſantly, to thoſe which the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident himſelf has thought fit to furniſh or to ſanction. I have many of them to adduce; but I feel fatigue; and it is a taſk too irkſome to wade through the whole collection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi> theſe are expreſſions reſpecting the characters and conduct of the French rulers, and of the French nation, that I am about to quote. I know that reflections have been thrown upon many perſons in this country, eſpecially if they are not natives, as too much addicted to French politics. I hope it will not be improper to obviate that ſtigma in my own caſe: nor do I know how to do it but by quoting a paſſage publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by myſelf, when this imputation and this trial could not have been in contemplation.</p>

               <p>If I have committed a miſtake I am very ſorry for it, but I have committed none: where this language is permitted or encouraged— where the anſwers re-echo or approve the addreſſes, that approbation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to an adoption by the Preſident. For inſtance, in the anſwer to the laſt addreſs I read, the Preſident begins
<q>Gentlemen, I thank you for this addreſs, Your encomiums on the executive authority of the government is in a high degree flattering.</q>
Sir, I have a right to contend that this retort complimentary, on the part of the Preſident, is a direct approbation of the language of the addreſs. I need not however refer to the addreſſes at all, for I have enough among the anſwers in the twenty other inſtances I have ſelected, compleatly to eſtabliſh my poſition; not that a few caſes of harſh and intemperate language, have inadvertendly eſcaped through warmth of temper and a ſenſe of national provocation, but that they have been ſyſtematically, perſeveringly, indulged in.</p>
               <p>But I begin to grow weary of this cauſe; and I feel diſinclined to fatigue

myſelf and you ſtill more by wading through this collection of unpleaſant and irritating expreſſions: nor do I think it worth while to employ my time and yours in contending every technical objection. I did not fully expect ſuch frequent interruptions, on a trial of this nature, or to have fought my way, <hi>per tot ambages, per tot diſcrimina rerum.</hi> I ſhall quit therefore the paper of extracts <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vide Appendix no. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> I hold in my hand, and quote no more of them. But theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and anſwers are not the only foundations of the aſſertions I made. The French themſelves have complained of this violent language and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt accuſation of their principles and conduct. They have felt the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and have expreſsly made it <hi>an obſtacle to negotiation.</hi> In page 19 of the inſtructions to the Envoys, &amp;c. publiſhed by the Secretary of State, in conformity to the reſolution of Congreſs of June 22, 1798, thoſe Envoys inform us that
<q>M. Y. took out of his pocket a French tranſlation of the Preſident's ſpeech, the parts of which objected to by the Directory, were marked agreeably to our requeſt to M. X. and are contained in the exhibit A,</q>
(this exhibit I need not read at length: it will be found in p. 24 of the book I am quoting.)
<q>Then he made us the ſecond ſet of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which were dictated by him and written by M. X. in our preſence, and delivered to us, and which tranſlated from the French are as follows: There is demanded a formal diſavowal in writing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that the ſpeech of the Citizen Preſident Barras did not contain any thing offenſive to the government of the United States, nor any thing which deſerved the epithets contained in the whole paragraph.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In another part of the ſame page the envoys tell us M Y. informed them that "the directory were extremely irritated on account of ſome parts of the Preſident's ſpeech." Now, gentlemen of the jury, that ſpeech is mildneſs itſelf compared with the extracts I have read, and was prepared to read to you from the addreſſes and anſwers of the Preſident, publiſhed in the ſame month with this very book.</p>
               <p>In page 92 the Envoys give us a tranſlation of the letter of M. Talley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, the miniſter of foreign relations, to them. In p. 97 there is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paragraph of that letter.

The executive directory has ſeen itſelf denounced in a ſpeech delivered by the Preſident in the courſe of the month of May laſt (O. S.) as endeavouring to propagate anarchy and diviſion within the United States. The new allies which the republic has acquired, and who are the ſame that contributed to the independence of Americans have been equally inſulted in the official correſpondencies that have been made public, or in the newſpapers. In fine, one cannot help diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the tone of the ſpeech and of the publications which have juſt
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037249_0030_100C9D327141ECA0"/>
been pointed out, a latent enmity which only waits an opportunity to break out.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, after the ſerious manner in which the tone of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial expreſſions had been noticed by the French nation—after it was made an avowed obſtacle to negociation—where was the prudence or propriety of a perſevering reiteration of language ſuch as I have read to you? For my own part, I cannot help thinking ſuch conduct in a public character raſh and indecorous, and highly deſerving the reprehenſion I have expreſſed.</p>
               <p>The next and laſt point, that which ſeems to be the moſt ſerious of all, is, <hi>the interference of the Preſident in the deciſion of a court of juſtice in the caſe of Jonathan Robbins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This caſe has received ſuch full and ſuch <hi>recent</hi> diſcuſſion; it has been ſo much talked of <hi>in</hi> congreſs, and written of <hi>out</hi> of congreſs, that I do not think it neceſſary to enter into all the details of evidence and argument which would have been neceſſary could I have preſumed you unacquainted with the ſubject. I ſhall, however, prove to you, gentlemen of the jury, that there has been ſuch an interference on the part of the Preſident, that it was not only without, but againſt precedent and againſt law; and if ſo, you will alſo conclude with me that it was againſt mercy. Here is the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Preſident to congreſs on the caſe of Jonathan Robbins, authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticating the communications of Mr. Pickering.

I have ſtated the matter to the Preſident of the United States.

Preſident gives his opinion on the ſubject of juriſdiction, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the clauſe of the treaty; and authorizes Mr. Pickering to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Preſident's ADVICE and REQUEST that Naſh ſhould be delivered up. Now, gentlemen, without entering into any argument on the queſtion of territorial juriſdiction; or the conſtruction of the clauſe of the treaty—without going into the point that the crime of piracy gave ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction to the court here—I reſt my aſſertion that the Preſident interfered improperly <hi>on this;</hi> that if he had authority to do what he did, he would not have <hi>adviſed</hi> and <hi>requeſted,</hi> but REQUIRED AND DIRECTED: an advice may be rejected; a requeſt may be refuſed, without attaching blame to the perſon who by this language is permitted to exerciſe his own judgment and inclination. Either the Preſident had authority to interfere or he had not; if he had authority, the language ſhould have been peremptory and not ſubject to excuſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I might have made enquiry by teſtimony into the circumſtances attending the trial of the ſailors from the Hermione before his honour Judge Chaſe, in New-Jerſey.

               <p>I am much obliged to the court, and to the gentlemen who have attended; but I ſhall proceed and finiſh as ſoon as I can.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid this was an interference that the monarch of Great-Britain would have ſhrunk from. Let the caſe be pointed out if it can, <hi>when</hi> a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of Great-Britain has made ſuch an attempt. I know of none; and I know alſo enough of the law and of the ſpirit of that country, to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that no ſuch attempt would be ventured on there.</p>
               <p>It is without precedent—I ſay further, it is againſt precedent. I hold in my hands the caſe of the United States vs. judge Lawrence (p. 42 of 3 Dall. Rep.) The ſubſtance of that caſe is this: Capt. Barré of the French veſſel le Perdrix, abandoned his ſhip, became reſident at New York, was claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a deſerter by the Conſul of the French Republic, and required to be delivered up under the 9th art. of the conſular convention between the United States and France, which authorizes the mutual delivery of deſerters to the conſuls or vice conſuls of the reſpective Countries, on demand made in writing to the Courts, Judges, and officers competent; and on proof by the exhibition of the Ship's Roll, that the perſons required were part of the Crews. The French conſul could not produce the original regiſter or role d'equipage, but a copy only: this, Judge Lawrence thought inſufficient evidence under the clauſe of the Convention. The Miniſter of the French
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037249_0032_100C9D35F913C548"/>
Republic then applied to the executive, complaining of the refuſal, and
<q>the preſent motion was made in order to obtain the opinion of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court (of the U. S.) upon the ſubject for the ſatisfaction of the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter. After counſel were heard in oppoſition to the motion</q>
the Attorney General (Bradford) in reply premiſed that the Executive of the U. S. had
<q>no inclination to preſs upon the Court any particular conſtruction of the article on which his motion was founded, but as it was the wiſh of our Government to preſerve the pureſt faith with all nations, the Preſident could not avoid paying the higheſt reſpects and the prompteſt attention to the repreſentation of the Miniſter of France, who conceived that the deciſion of the diſtrict Judge involved an infraction of the conventional rights of his republic, ***** In the preſent caſe from the nature of the ſubject as well as from the ſpirit of our political conſtitution, the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary department is called on to decide. For it is eſſential to the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of that department, that judicial miſtakes ſhould only be corrected by judicial authority. The Preſident therefore introduces the queſtion for the conſideration of the Court, in order to inſure a punctual execution of the Laws, and at the ſame time to manifeſt to the world the ſolicitude of our Government to preſerve its faith and to cultivate the friendſhip and reſpect of foreign nations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here then in both caſes, (the conſtitutional powers of Gen. Waſhington and Mr. Adams being the ſame) a foreign Conſul claims a Man to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up under a Clauſe of a treaty. The claim in both caſes is made to a diſtrict Judge: in both caſes the foreign Miniſter afterwards applies for the ſame purpoſe to the Preſident of the U. S. and at this point, the Similitude ends. For Gen. Waſhington did not hazard an opinion of his own or exert executive influence in favour of the application from the French miniſter, but <hi>introduced the queſtion for the conſideration of the Court</hi>—Mr. Adams did ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his own opinion in favour of Mr. Liſton's application, and adviſed and requeſted Judge Bee to conform to it. Gen. Waſhington
<q>had no inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preſs upon the Court any particular conſtruction of the clauſe in the Treaty</q>
Mr. Adams not only inclined, but indulged his inclination in preſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Judge Bee that conſtruction of the clauſe in the Treaty which was moſt favourable to the Britiſh claim. Gen. Waſhington deemed it
<q>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the independence of the Judiciary Department, that judicial miſtakes ſhould be corrected by judicial authority</q>
—Mr. Adams not ſo tender of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary honour and independence, boldly ſatisfied the ſcruples of Judge Bee by executive authority. Gen. Waſhington
<q>from the nature of the ſubject, as well as from the Spirit of our political Conſtitution</q>
left the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary department to decide the queſtion—The nature of the ſubject and the ſpirit of our political Conſtitution, were no obſtacles to Mr Adams; he decided the queſtion himſelf without being reſtrained by the one conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or the other. In the caſe of capt. Barré, Gen. Waſhington had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for interfering, which Mr. Adams had not; for it was the application of the conſul alone that gave juriſdiction to Judge Lawrence—whereas the charge of Piracy in the caſe of Robbins brought him compleatly within the juriſdiction of our Courts, even tho' it had been legally eſtabliſhed that he was a native ſubject of the Britiſh monarch. Gen. Waſhington acted in a new caſe; he had no previous deciſion to guide his conduct; he can
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037249_0033_100C9D38AFF56B88"/>
counter to no precedent of authority, to no caſe in point; no charge of Piracy gave undeniable juriſdiction: even though his good ſenſe <hi>had not</hi> prevented his interference with Judge Lawrence, the miſtake might in him have been forgiven—But Mr. Adams had a precedent to go by; he had law to guide his conduct? the caſe in point was within the compaſs of his information; the example ſet by his predeceſſor,</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, after theſe obſervations it will be for yor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide whether I have aſſerted too much in ſaying that Mr. Adams interfered without precedent and againſt law—might I not have been juſtified had I gone a little farther? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In this meſſage of the Preſident there are certificates from certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the town of Danbury denying that any man or any family of the name of Robbins had been known for many years <hi>within that town.</hi> There are two or three ſingular circumſtances attending theſe certificates.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Cooper.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, the point in queſtion is, the <hi>truth or falſehood</hi> of the charge. I <hi>had</hi> evidence ſufficient before me when I wrote it; ſufficient to ſatisfy my own mind: what if I have ſtill better evidence now? Is the fact the leſs true becauſe the Preſident confirms it? The facts had been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in almoſt every paper of the United States—they were detailed at length in a publication then before me, and now on the table, by a moſt reſpectable member of the Senate, Mr. Charles Pinckney; which I do not offer in evidence becauſe I know it will be objected to. Beſides this, I have already ſtated that theſe facts are and muſt be to the jury, matters of recent and public notoriety: they are ſo referred to by Mr. Pickering in his own report: they have boen given in all the debates in Congreſs lately publiſhed, and even now daily publiſhing; and I have a right, as I think, to adduce this meſſage, at leaſt as <hi>additional</hi> and <hi>corroborative</hi> teſtimony. But the iſſue between us is, TRUE or NOT TRUE; the iſſue is not, had I the <hi>beſt</hi> evidence at the time I wrote or not. Whatever evidence I poſſeſſed at the time I wrote, it is enough for me at this time, to prove that what I wrote was and is true: and the meſſage goes directly to this point.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I ſay there are two or three ſingular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending theſe certificates. They alſo, are far more liable to this objection than the evidence I have offered; for they have been preſſed into the ſervice, long after the publication of Robbins's affidavit that he was a native American. Theſe certificates do not ſtate that no ſuch family as Robbins, was known <hi>in the neighbourhood of Danbury,</hi> as I ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve may yet be proved. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide appendix No. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> The time of the enquiring into this fact is alſo curious: While Robbins was alive, while he claimed (for I again repeat it as a notorious fact, and a fact referred to by Mr. Pickering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the firſt page of the Report, that he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d claim) to be a native
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037249_0034_100C9D3ACB56D118"/>
American, no enquiry was thought neceſſary: while he could have an opportunity to repel by evidence a counter affidavit, none was made: nay the Judge himſelf appears to have thrown the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of citizenſhip out of the queſtion.—But now, when Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins has been delivered up and executed—when the enquiry can do him no ſervice, and he is no longer alive to direct or to benefit by it, it has become an important queſtion! The induſtry of Mr. Pickering has been exerted to bring us proof from all quarters, from Connecticut to Jamaica: the guarded evidence of the wiſe men of Danbury, and the diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted teſtimony of Sir Hyde Parker are ſet in array againſt the claim of Robbins. The Preſident tranſmits this accumulation of irrefragable proof to Congreſs; our Repreſentatives debate upon it; and the citizenſhip of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins at length becomes a queſtion moſt material to be aſcertained<note n="†" place="bottom">Why? becauſe the affidavit of Robbins, and the impreſſion made by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin's claim muſt be counteracted. But is not the pains thus taken, full evidence of the Notoriety of the claim!</note>; If the evidence I have offered is objectionable, what ſhall we ſay to Mr. Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings authorities? It is well that Congreſs is not ſcrupulous about the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of teſtimony: It is well that the evidence contained in the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents meſſage on this part of Robbin's hiſtory, was not ſubjected to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſts as I have had to combat!</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I do contend that this is not like a trial on a matter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, where every technical objection to evidence is admiſſible. That evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which does in fact, and ought in reaſon, to decide your political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct when you are out of that box, is the kind of evidence which ought to decide mine; and it is unreaſonable in my opinion on a political trial to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any other; or to harraſs a defendant by putting him to the enormous trouble and expence of travelling from one end of the Continent to the other, to bring forward legal evidence of a fact which nobody doubts before hand. I do contend, Gentlemen of the Jury, that there are, and may be certain facts of public politics ſufficiently notorious to obviate the neceſſity of legal proof, and whoſe notoriety, is itſelf a matter of fact, which may in all caſes be ſafely left to a jury to judge of.</p>
               <p>The affidavit of Jonathan Robbins ſo often publiſhed, ſo commonly known, whoſe authenticity has never been ſcrupled, tho' its veracity has lately been denied, is one of thoſe notorious facts that fall within the ſpirit of the preceding obſervations. While Robbins lived, it was uncontradicted by equal evidence; indeed it is ſo ſtill: I had reaſon to give credit to it at the time I wrote, and I believe in the probability of it now.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have gone through all the charges; and I am ſatisfied that I have brought in ſupport of my aſſertions, the beſt evidence the nature of my caſe would admit of.—It is true by reſorting to Danbury for depoſitions and to Charles Town for records, I might have made the evidence in the laſt charge, more compleat; but I did not and do not think them neceſſary to produce further conviction on your minds, than you feel on the ſubject already. This is an important point under the law in queſtion. If ſuch ſtrictneſs of teſtimony is required, there is an end at once of all political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in promiſcuous ſociety. The time, the labour, the difficulty, the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037249_0035_100C9D3CE3AA5348"/>
expence, the barraſſment and fatigue, of mind as well as of body, which ſuch doctrine would occaſion, to every citizen whom a corrupt adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might determine to ruin, would be an engine of oppreſſion of itſelf ſufficiently powerful to eſtabliſh a perfect deſpotiſm over the preſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would be a puniſhment for innocence before trial, too ſevere to be inflicted on ſedition itſelf. I think you muſt feel the truth of theſe remarks: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings on this trial, irreſiſtibly ſuggeſt them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if the aſſertions I have made are true, whatever the motives of them may be, you cannot find me guilty. But I think it impoſſible if you conſider the paper all together that you can aſcribe the publication of it to malice: it is on the force of it not voluntary but compelled. I have in the very outſet of the paper ſpoken well of the Preſident: I have been in the habit of thinking his intentions right, and his public conduct wrong: and that this has been the general tennor of my language and behaviour, I believe I can even now bring proof enough from among my friends and my neighbours. <stage>Mr. Cooper calls two witneſſes.</stage>

            <p>
               <hi>Mr. RAWLE, in reply:—</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>
               <p>The defence you have juſt heard is one of the moſt extraordinary and unexampled I ever remember to have witneſſed in a court of juſtice. It is no leſs than to call into deciſion whether Thomas Cooper, the defendant, or the Preſident of the United States, to whom this country has thought proper to confide its moſt important intereſts, is beſt qualified to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the meaſures adopted by our government are calculated to preſerve the peace and promote the happineſs of America. This, however, does not ſeem to me the real point which you are to try; and I ſhall therefore (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der direction of the court) proceed to ſtate what <hi>I</hi> conceive to be the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which you, Gentlemen of the Jury are now called upon to determine. Thomas Cooper is charged in the Indictment with having publiſhed a falſe ſcandalous and malicious libel with intent to defame the Preſident of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States and to bring him into contempt and diſrepute, and to excite againſt him the hatred of the good people of this country. In the act which defines this offence, and points out the puniſhment, a liberality of defence is given, unknown I believe in any other Country <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Rawle forgot that the ſame defence is given in England under what is called Mr. Fox's bill.</note> where the party is tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a libel on the Government. Here, the defendant is allowed under the third ſection of that act, to give in evidence the truth of the matters charged as a libel in the publication, and the Jury have a right to determine the Law and the fact under the direction of the Court. The
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037249_0036_100C9D3EA39CBEB8"/>
true ſpirit of the Law is that the defendant ſhall not be found guilty of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing defamatory writings, unleſs they be falſe, nor altho' they may be falſe, ſhall he be conſidered as guilty under the law, unleſs the intent of the publication appear to be malicious.</p>
               <p>That ſuch publication has proceeded upon a knowledge of the truth, he is permitted to give as matter of evidence; and if true, it muſt be allowed to go far to ſatisfy the minds of the Jury, that the malicious motives impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him are not true. In private actions for ſlander, where a man ſeeks pecuniary redreſs for the injury his character has ſuſtained, the defendant is entitled to give in evidence as a defence to the action, the truth of the words ſpoken or the written libel; and if the truth of the aſſertions be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it will amount to a juſtification. There is no difference then between the defence that may be ſet up to an action of ſlander, or libel on a private perſon, and that which is permitted under the law whereon this indictment is grounded.</p>
               <p>The defendant has undertaken to ſatisfy the mind of the Jury that in this publication he had no malicious intention againſt the Preſident of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States; I join iſſue with him on the point, and requeſt your particular attention to it. He alledges that he did not impute improper motives to the Preſident, and attempts to ſubſtantiate his allegation by referring you to his declaration in the outſet where he ſays that "I cannot believe him (the Preſident) capable of ſuch groſs miſrepreſentations, for I ſtill think well of his intentions, however I may diſapprove of his conduct," but to this I ſhall add that he goes on and concludes with a paragraph, evincing in the cleareſt manner a ſettled deſign to perſuade the public that the Preſident of the United States is not fit for the high office he bears, and of this you muſt be fully convinced from the whole tenor of the expreſſions which have been read to you in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>It is very far from my views to preſs hard upon any part of his long ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to you, or to make uſe againſt him of any unguarded expreſſion, which on more deliberate conſideration he might have omitted or corrected; yet when I cannot but obſerve from the whole tenor of his preſent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as from his publication, that his object is not ſo much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you Gentlemen of the Jury, that his aſsertions are true, as to caſt an unmerited reflection on the general character and conduct of the Preſident, I cannot help ſuſpecting him of the motives he diſclaims, and I muſt do my duty by expoſing the deſign as well as the fallacy of the juſtification he has ſet up.</p>
               <p>The defendant has uſed a little obſervation reſpecting the ſeparating in the indictment the text, from the context, as I believe he was pleaſed to term it; and argued that by this means the moſt upright intentions and laudable expreſſions might be perverted from their true and obvious meaning. Such an inſinuation however is not calculated to influence your minds. In fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming an indictment it is my duty to leave out matters of little importance, and to introduce thoſe circumſtances only that are truly and legally repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible: and he well knows that he can read if he pleaſes the whole of the publication, and that you will have it with you when you conſider of your Verdict. You will judge therefore whether by this obſervation it was his, or whether it is my deſign to confound and perplex the ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:037249_0037_100C9D4056588908"/>Whether the reflections he has thrown upon the conduct of Government in ſo many inſtances throughout his defence as well as in his publication, evince the regard he profeſſes to entertain for the intentions of the Preſident, is to me as it will be to you extremely dubious; nor have thoſe profeſſions been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the ſingular manner in which he has cited and ſelected the paſſages on which his defence has been grounded. Throughout the quotations he has made, particularly from the addreſſes to the Preſident, and the anſwers to them, there has been a ſeries of miſrepreſentations which it will be my duty to obſerve upon when I come to conſider that part of the charge and his vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of it. But it is fair to obſerve that if from the peruſal of partial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and paſſages ſelected from various publications he has thought proper to publiſh a libel, ſuch as that for which he is indicted againſt the character of our Preſident, there is no excuſe for his conduct; if on the other hand he had the whole of the publications before him, and has extracted from them partially and unfairly, his conduct is ſtill more reprehenſible, and there is the leſs excuſe, as it is evident, and as you Gentlemen of the Jury, muſt have obſerved, that he is a man of talents and letters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cooper has thought proper to take up the ſeveral paſſages of his publication in the order in which they ſtand in the indictment, and in reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he has ſaid I ſhall follow the order he has purſued.</p>
               <p>I paſs over the paſſages reſpecting the incapacity of the Preſident, and the infancy of political miſtakes as of no great importance, and proceed to that part of the publication which accuſes our Chief Magiſtrate of having ſanctioned and promoted, a permanent navy, a ſtanding army, and a loan at the high intereſt of 8 per cent in time of peace, while the unneceſſary violence of official expreſſions might juſtly have provoked a war.</p>
               <p>Here then the implication againſt the Preſident is that at the ſame time when he was unneceſſarily plunging us into a War he promoted a Navy, a ſtanding Army, and borrowed money at an exorbitant intereſt, the one meaſure calculated to enſlave and the other to oppreſs. But Gentlemen, how has the defendant ſhown this, what proof has he offered that theſe are meaſures for which the Preſident in particular is blameable? Need I recall to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection the Summer of the year 1798 when in conſequence of the diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and inſulting treatment and rejection of our envoys by the French Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the Citizens of this Country from every part of the United States addreſſed the Preſident approving his meaſures and pledging their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? Amongſt others the Marine ſociety at Boſton came forward congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating the American Nation that their beloved Waſhington has been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a Man who treads with equal ſteps the honeſt plain and ſtrait road ſo ſtrictly followed by that wiſe and able ſtateſman.</p>
               <p>In this particular caſe gentlemen, with your permiſſion I will read the whole of the anſwer <stage>(reads the anſwer from Patriotic Addreſſes, page 95.)</stage>
Now gentlemen I appeal to you, was it not natural and becoming, that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the addreſs of a marine ſociety, the Preſident ſhould dwell upon the topic moſt congenial to their inſtitution? Thoſe who do not look with a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous eye on every action and catch with a propenſity to blame at every word he utters, thoſe who know the character of that gentleman in private life, and who have impartially witneſſed his unremitting endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037249_0038_100C9D43A4F83BC0"/>
the defence and welfare of his country can ſurely find nothing but what they may ſincerely praiſe in the anſwer I have juſt read to you.</p>
               <p>The next paſſage Mr. Cooper has quoted is from the addreſs of the young men of Boſton: this addreſs and the anſwer has been uſed for two purpoſes to ſupport; his poſition that the Preſident had recommended a navy and an army. Gentlemen I will read the whole of the anſwer <stage>(reads from page 370 Patriotic Addreſs.)</stage>
I confeſs I was much ſurpriſed to find that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Preſident had recommended them to follow the "example of their fathers, one of whoſe firſt principles it was to unite in themſelves the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of citizens and ſoldiers, and eſpecially to preſerve the latter always ſubordinate to the former." I was very much ſurpriſed to find that ſuch an anſwer could be quoted as reprehenſible.</p>
               <p>To arms then my young friends to arms eſpecially by ſea, <hi>to be uſed as the law directs.</hi> Gentlemen can ſuch ſentiments ſo honeſtly guarded, be tortured into proof of the Preſidents intention to plunge us into a war, to introduce a ſtanding army and a permanent navy? Gentlemen theſe are not the concluſions <hi>you</hi> will draw. The paternal care of the Preſident has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to happily watched over this country, and he knew and wiſely ſignified the time when we ought to be prepared for thoſe gloomy events, which we had too much reaſon to expect. Whether the adduction of theſe paſſages can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the defendant in his defence againſt a malicious libel you are the beſt judges.</p>
               <p>The defendant has read to you a paſſage culled from the anſwer of the Preſident to the ſtudents of Dickenſon college, wherein he hopes that none of them but ſuch as feel a natural genius and diſpoſition to martial exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and exertions, will ever be called from the pleaſing walks of ſcience to repel any attack on their rights, liberties and independence: ſurely gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen if a moderate and affectionate ſentiment of this kind, is to be tor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tured into an approbation of a military force or a ſtanding army, the moſt innocent expreſſions are not ſafe from perverſions. I cannot however for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to remark with how little propriety the defendant has complained of paſſages being ſelected from his publication for indictment without the context as he calls it, when his whole defence reſts upon paſſages thus pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, to ſuit the unfair and malicious purpoſes of his defence, an epithet which I feel myſelf entitled to uſe, when I conſider how that defence has been conducted and on what it reſts.</p>
               <p>But gentlemen of the jury, the defendant muſt have very little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the exiſting circumſtances of this country,<note n="*" place="bottom">Either Mr. Rawle or I, muſt have very little knowledge of the exiſting circumſtances of this country. I fear he is liable to the retort, mutato nomine de te fabula narratur. The term ſtanding army we got from England, when it is applied to a military force in continual and not in periodical diſcipline like the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia. In that country there has been a ſtanding army i. e. a continued military force independent of the militia for <hi>150</hi> years at leaſt; the men are enliſted for life and yet the mutiny bill under which that force exiſts is annual. Does Mr. Rawle know or does he not, that in the <hi>5</hi> year-army of this country as judge Chaſe would call it,—the men continue to be enliſted for <hi>5</hi> years from the date of their enliſtment. So that at the end of <hi>2</hi> years for inſtance, a man is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted for <hi>3</hi> years but ſtill for <hi>5</hi> years! Does Mr. Rawle know that this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the recommendations of the Secretary at war in his report tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Congreſs <hi>13</hi>th January laſt? and that the recruiting inſtructions are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

of a ſtanding army. There neither is nor can be a ſtanding army in this country, the appropriations for the pay of the army cannot be made for more than two years at a time, nor has the Preſident more to do with the army than the Congreſs or the Senate,<note n="†" place="bottom">Yes he had: for the meaſures originated from the ſuggeſtions in his ſpeeches to Congreſs, and the reports of his Secretary of war.</note> and the reflections thrown upon your firſt magiſtrate are equally applicable to your repreſentatives. A man ſo ignorant of the ſubject, or whoſe reading has been ſo careleſs, is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified to caſt a reflection on the conduct of our government, or to inſtruct the people on the nature and tendency of the meaſures of adminiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ation.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the loan at 8 per cent. if money has been borrowed at that rate of intereſt, of which however the defendant has produced to you no proof, it has been done under the authority of Congreſs and their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Rawle probably forgot that the Preſident was authorized to borrow upon ſuch terms, and conditions as he thought moſt advantageous to the United States; and that the rate of intereſt was the meaſure of the Executive Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
in this reſpect the Preſident has ſanctioned as he had a right to do, and as I think (confiding in his wiſdom and integrity) he has rightly done.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I do not pretend to be a judge of the propriety of this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Defendant ſays no other country has borrowed at ſo high a rate of intereſt in time of peace; but neither is he qualified to judge of this any more than myſelf; thoſe who are qualified and who have been appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the purpoſe, have judged for the nation; and I am ſatisfied as I doubt not you are. But to raiſe ſurmiſes and ſuſpicions of the wiſdom and deſign of meaſures of this kind, which he cannot know ſufficient of to explain, or the people to underſtand, is evidence in my opinion that <hi>his</hi> deſign at leaſt was to excite the hatred of the good people of this country againſt their Preſident.</p>
               <p>The Defendant proceeds to charge the Preſident with unneceſſary vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of official expreſſion that might juſtly have provoked a war. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you all of you know the provoking and unjuſtifiable conduct of the French Nation towards our envoys: the repeated deſigns and attempts of this country to procure an adjuſtment of differences on equitable grounds, and the ſtrange and unexampled propoſitions made in return by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of France. It is not for me to dilate upon theſe topics, or on the depredations ſubſequently committed by that Nation on the American Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, you all of you know, you all of you muſt have felt in ſome degree the conſequence of her injuſtice: the Preſident, far better acquainted with theſe proceedings againſt America and the tendency of them, made uſe of ſuch expreſſions as the ſtate of the country and the ſentiments of the people required. Of this he was the beſt judge, and I doubt not in this inſtance as in every other of his wiſe and patriotic adminiſtration he judged for the beſt. The Defendant however ſtill wiſer than the Preſident judged other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and has accordingly ventured to advance before the public the harſh Crimination we are now conſidering.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Defendant has quoted paſſages from the addreſs of the inhabitants of Vergennes in Vermont. I have before remarked to you the ſingular, and I think the unfair method of ſelection the Defendant has
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037249_0040_100C9D47B8133598"/>
adopted; and the impropriety of ſtating the ſentiments of the addreſs itſelf as if it were the anſwer of the Preſident and attributable to him. I will read you the paſſage <stage>(reads it.)</stage>
no ſuch paſſage appears in the anſwer of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, and whether the ſentiments contained in it are true or not, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be the ſentiments of others and not of the Preſident. Such is the way in whick this Defence has been conducted, I will not go through the reſt of Mr. Coopers quotations, becauſe I do not think they have produced any effect on your minds or on the minds of the Court, which it is neceſſary for me to obviate.</p>
               <p>The Defendant next recurs to the complaints of the French Government to our Envoys of the Expreſſions in the Preſident's Speech. No doubt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, it was the intereſt and the inclination of the French Executive to raiſe up ſome frivolous objection to the conduct of our Government that they might have ſome plauſible pretext to juſtify their own.</p>
               <p>But I am fully ſatisfied as I hope and believe you are, that the Preſident of the United States had ſufficient foundation for all that he has ſaid on the conduct of France toward this country, and I ſhall leave you to judge for yourſelves whether he or the Defendant are the moſt proper to decide what conduct or language ought to have been adopted on ſuch provocation.</p>
               <p>The next and moſt ſerious part of this Indictment is that which relates to Thomas Naſh, or, as he has been called, Jonathan Robbins. Gentlemen I will read you the paſſage in the Indictment <stage>(reads it.)</stage>
Now Gentlemen it is important for you to remember the remote part of the country where this libel was publiſhed, and the claſs of people among whom it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated, <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Rawle is miſtaken in his ideas of the people of Northumberland county. They are as capable of judging as the generality of the people here. There are ſome men there who hold the ſame politics with Mr. Rawle (not meaning to include his deputy) of as much natural talent and as much legal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement, and as ready to defend the meaſures of the government without pay, as he for the fees he receives. But the good ſenſe of the people is a full balance for the combination of talent devoted to the meaſures of adminiſtration.</note> and conſider what muſt be the effect of aſſertions thus boldly advanced and ſtrongly ſtated. Mr. Cooper either had evidence before him of the facts he has aſſerted reſpecting this Naſh or Robbins, or he had not. If he had no evidence—what ſhall we ſay of a man deliberately propagating among an ignorant people, libels of the moſt ſerious nature and accuſations againſt the higheſt characters, which if he does not know to be falſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know to be true? In ſupport of his aſſertions he has read to you the Meſſage of the Preſident of the United States on the ſubject of Thomas Naſh, or rather he has read in detached parts in a mutilated manner the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Mr. Pickering: it is obſervable that he could not have had this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before him at the time he wrote, and yet this is the only evidence he has offered to the court in his own defence on this part of the charge.</p>

Preſident as additional and corroborative teſtimony of what was very generally known to the public. Beſide this, I had before me Mr. Pinckney's letters containing all the facts: theſe alſo were publiſhed in the papers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were collected in a pamphlet, and that pamphlet was publiſh- in Auguſt 1799; while the paper indicted was not publiſhed till Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1799.</p>

You obſerve gentlemen of the jury, that Mr. Cooper omitted all that paſſage beginning with "Provided no evidence of his criminality, &amp;c." This opinion, given by the Preſident, was confirmed by the vote of the Houſe of Repreſentatives in rejecting a motion criminating his conduct; and it would be confirmed by Mr. Cooper himſelf as a lawyer, if he had duly conſidered the ſubject, or if his opinions had not been warped by the influence of his political prejudices. But gentlemen, ſuppoſe the Preſident had not done his duty, as he did— that he had not directed this Naſh to be delivered up, then would the party oppoſed to his adminiſtration, have raiſed an outcry as loud, and perhaps better founded than they have made already. No conduct of the Preſident however wiſe, no motives however pure, could ſcreen him from the attacks of party ſpirit. But he has honeſtly endeavoured to preſerve the good faith of the country by carrying a treaty into effect, and I truſt he will receive the applauſe of impartial and competent judges for his behaviour on that occaſion.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen you have attended to the words of this charge in the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and you cannot but be impreſſed that they convey on the face and in the very tenor of them, a ccncluſive proof of a mala mens, of a malicious and deliberate intention to injure the character of the Preſident; no man can read them without receiving this impreſſion from the peruſal.</p>
               <p>I have not touched on the article reſpecting the embaſſies to Pruſſia, Ruſſia, and the Porte, becauſe I did not think it of importance ſufficient to occupy much of your time. Indeed, I believe no embaſſy was ever ſent to Ruſſia.<note n="*" place="bottom">But it was <hi>projected</hi> (my expreſſion) Mr. King was authorized to confer with the Ruſſian ambaſſador on the ſubject.</note> There is enough for your conſideration againſt the defendant, without dwelling on theſe leſſer articles of the indictment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen I have no perſonal animoſity againſt Mr. Cooper, but I have inſtituted this proſecution becauſe I thought it my duty ſo to do, and I muſt make thoſe remarks which the ſame duty calls forth.</p>
               <p>The defendant has endeavoured to ſhew that his publication was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out malice, but his conduct with 'ſquire Buyers and his expreſſions in that publication prove otherwiſe; the nature of his defence, though he has ſtated his opinion of the good intention of the Preſident, evidently ſhews that he meant to juſtify his own conduct and language throughout. You

Gentlemen of the Jury under the direction of the court, will decide whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has preſented to you ſuch a juſtification as will entitle him to your verdict in his favour.</p>

                              <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury.</hi> (<note n="A" place="bottom">The reader is requeſted to pay attention to this charge: it is accurately taken. Some of the points worthy of obſervation, I have made ſhort notes upon; others I muſt diſcuſs in my letter to the Judge</note>)</p>
                           <p>WHEN men are found raſh enough to commit an offence ſuch as the Traverſer is charged with, it becomes the duty of the government to take care that they ſhould not paſs with impunity—It is my duty to ſtate to you the law on which this indictment is preferred, and the ſubſtance of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation and defence.</p>
                           <p>Thomas Cooper the Traverſer ſtands charged with having publiſhed a falſe ſcandalous and malicious libel againſt the Preſident of the United States in his official character as Preſident. There is no civilized country that I know of that does not puniſh ſuch offences; and it is neceſſary to the peace and welfare of this country, that theſe offences ſhould meet with their proper puniſhment, ſince ours is a government founded on the opinions and confidence of the people. The Repreſentatives and the Preſident are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the people. It is a government made by themſelves; and their officers are choſen by themſelves; and therefore if any improper law is enacted, the people have it in their power to obtain the repeal of ſuch law or even of the conſtitution itſelf if found defective, ſince proviſion is made for its amendment.—Our government therefore is really republican, the people are truly repreſented ſince all power is derived from them—it is a government of repreſentation and reſponſibility—all officers of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are liable to be diſplaced or removed, or their duration in office limited by election at fixed periods—there is one department only, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary, which is not ſubject to ſuch removal; their offices, being held "during good behaviour" and therefore they can only be removed for miſbehaviour.</p>
                           <p>All governments which I have ever read or heard of puniſh libels againſt themſelves. If a man attempts to deſtroy the confidence of the people in their officers, their ſupreme magiſtrate, and their legiſlature, he effectually ſaps the foundation of the government—(<note n="B" place="bottom">I would aſk the Judge, whether if the Supreme Magiſtrate adopts mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures inconſiſtent with the public intereſt, it is not the duty of every good citizen to expoſe him to the public? and whether there may not be a Government ſtill exiſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing altho' the Chief Magiſtrate and every Member of the Legiſlature were changed? what is the uſe of Election in a free Government, but for the People to expreſs whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Supreme Magiſtrate and their Legiſlators deſerve their further confidence or not?</note>) A republican government can only be deſtroyed in two ways; the introduction of luxury, or the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037249_0043_100C9D4F26359208"/>
of the preſs. (<note n="C" place="bottom">On this moſt extraordinary portion, I would aſk, 1ſt. what Government ever was deſtroyed by the lincentiouſneſs of the Preſs? 2ly. what Government ever was deſtroyed by Luxury? 3ly. whether a ſtanding army has not been the principal cauſe of the deſtruction of every Government ancient or modern that approached to a Republic?</note>) This latter is the more ſlow but moſt ſure and certain means of bringing about the deſtruction of the government. The legiſlature of this country knowing this maxim, has thought proper to paſs a law to check this licentiouſneſs of the preſs—by a clauſe in that law it is enacted (reads the ſecond ſection of the ſedition law.)</p>
                           <p>It muſt therefore be obſerved, Gentlemen of the Jury, that the <hi>intent</hi> muſt be plainly manifeſt; it is an important <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <p>Thomas Cooper then, ſtands indicted for having publiſhed a falſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and malicious libel upon the Preſident of the United States with <hi>intent</hi> to defame the Preſident, to bring him into contempt and diſrepute, and to excite againſt him the hatred of the good people of the United States. This is the charge: The Traverſer has pleaded Not Guilty, and that he has not publiſhed, &amp;c. with theſe views—he has alſo pleaded in juſtification (which the law provides for) that the matters aſſerted by him are true, and that he will give the ſame in evidence.</p>
                           <p>It is incumbent on the part of the proſecution to prove two facts, <list>
                                 <item>1ſt. That the Traverſer did publiſh the matters contained in the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                                 <item>2d. That he did publiſh with intent to defame, &amp;c.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>For the intent is as much a fact as the other, and muſt be proved in the ſame manner as other facts; and muſt be proved as ſtated in the law of Congreſs—the mere publication is no offence; and in making up your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, though you conſider them ſeparately, you muſt take the whole tenor and import of the publication, ſince the offence is commuted by the two coupled together,</p>
                           <p>Firſt then as to the publication.</p>
                           <p>The fact of writing and publiſhing is clearly proved, nay in fact, it is not denied—it is proved to have taken place at Sunbury a conſiderable diſtance from the ſeat of government: It appears from the evidence, that the Traverſer went to the houſe of a juſtice of the peace with this paper, whom, of all others, he ought to have avoided. (<note n="D" place="bottom">Is it a crime that I do not ſhelter myſelf under anonymous ſignature? that what I do, I do openly?

I felt myſelf conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of no crime: was it criminal in me to banter the official zeal of a party runner?</note>) For he muſt know that it was the duty of the juſtice of peace to deliver it immediately to thoſe who adminiſter the government: He did ſo. It was indecent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver ſuch a paper to a juſtice of the peace, and the manner in which it was delivered was yet more outrageous—if it was done in joke as the Traverſer would wiſh to imply, it was ſtill very improper—but there was the ſame ſolemnity in his expreſſion "this is my name, and I am the author of this hand-bill" as if the Traverſer was going to part with an eſtate.— This conduct ſhewed that he intended to dare and defy the government, and to provoke them, and his ſubſequent conduct ſatisfies my mind, that
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037249_0044_100C9D510041E718"/>
ſuch was his diſpoſition.—For he juſtifies the publication in all its parts, and declares it to be founded in truth—it is proved moſt clearly to be his publication. It is your buſineſs to conſider the intent as coupled with that, and view the whole together. You muſt take that publication and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the indictment, if there are doubts as to the motives of the Traverſer he has removed them, for though he ſtates in his defence that he does not arraign the motives of the Preſident, yet he has boldly avowed that his own motives in this publication were to cenſure the conduct of the Preſident, which his conduct, as he thought, deſerved.—Now Gentlemen, the motives of the Preſident in his official capacity, are not a ſubject of enquiry with you. Shall we ſay to the Preſident, you are not fit for the government of this country? It is no apology for a man to ſay, that he believes the Preſident to be honeſt, but that he has done acts which prove him unworthy the confidence of the people, incapable of executing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his high ſtation, and unfit for the important office to which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have elected him—the motives and intent of the Traverſer, not of the Preſident is the ſubject to be enquired into by you.</p>
                           <p>Now we will conſider this libel as publiſhed by the defendant, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what were his motives. You will find the Traverſer ſpeaking of the Preſident in the following words: "Even thoſe who doubted his capacity, thought well of his intentions." This the Traverſer might ſuppoſe would be conſidered as a compliment as to the intentions of the Preſident, but I have no doubt that it was meant to carry a ſting with it which ſhould be felt; for it was in ſubſtance ſaying of the Preſident, "you may have good intentions, but I doubt your capacity." (<note n="E" place="bottom">This is the firſt time the public have been informed, that it is a crime to doubt the capacity of a Preſident. Is it not a good reaſon for refuſing to vote for a man that you doubt his capacity for the Office? I voted for the Electoral Ticket friendly to Mr. Jefferſon at the laſt Election, becauſe I doubted Mr. Adam's capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to fill the office he now holds: I did not then doubt his intentions. I hope I ſhall have an opportunity of voting again, and the ſame reaſon that decided me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will go far to decide my vote again.</note>)</p>
                           <p>He then goes on to ſay, "Nor were we yet ſaddled with the expence of a permanent navy, nor threatened under his (the Preſident's auſpices) with the exiſtence of a ſtanding army. Our credit was not yet reduced ſo low as to borrow money at eight per cent. in <hi>time of peace.</hi>" Now Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, if theſe things were true, can any one doubt what effect they would have on the public mind? If the people believed thoſe things what would be the conſequence.—What, the Preſident of the United States ſaddle us with a permanent navy, encourage a ſtanding army, and borrow money at a large premium? And are we told too that this is in time of peace? if you believe this to be true, what opinion can you, Gentlemen, form of the Preſident? One obſervation muſt ſtrike you, viz. That theſe charges are made not only againſt the Preſident, but againſt yourſelves who elect the Houſe of Repreſentatives, for theſe acts cannot be done without firſt having been approved of by Congreſs. (<note n="F" place="bottom">If Judge Chaſe had read as he ought to have done the Act of Congreſs relating to the Loan, he would have found that the rate of Intereſt was left to the Executiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It cannot be—I ſay Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men again, if you believe this, what opinion can you form of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? Certainly the worſt you can form: You would certainly conſider him totally unfit for the high ſtation, which he has ſo honourably filled and with ſuch benefit to his country. (<note n="G" place="bottom">I aſk again, is it criminal for me to differ in opinion from Judge Chaſe, and to think Mr. Adams unfit for the high ſtation he fills? What becomes of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foundation of our elective rights, if we are liable to puniſhment for conſidering a chief Magiſtrate unfit for his ſituation? how many people in this country are there, who cannot help thinking thus of Mr. Adams? I ſincerely believe a large majority. He may be a very good man and a very ſenſible man, and yet not fit for his ſituation.</note>)</p>
                           <p>The Traverſer ſtates that under the auſpices of the Preſident "our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is ſo low that we are obliged to borrow money at eight per cent. in time of peace." I cannot ſuppreſs my feelings at this groſs attack upon the Preſident—Can this be true? Can you believe it? Are we now in time of peace? Is there no war? No hoſtilities with France? Has ſhe not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured our veſſels and plundered us of our property to the amount of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions? Has not the intercourſe been prohibited with her? Have we not armed our veſſels to defend ourſelves, and have we not captured ſeveral of her veſſels of war? Although no formal declaration of war has been made, is it not notorious that actual hoſtilities have taken place? And is this then a time of peace? The very expence incurred, which rendered a loan ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary was in conſequence of the conduct of France. The Traverſer therefore has publiſhed an untruth, knowing it to be an untruth.</p>
                           <p>The other part of the publication is much more offenſive: I do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to his aſſertions relating to the embaſſies to Pruſſia, Ruſſia and the Sublime Porte. They are matters of little conſequence, and therefore I ſhall paſs over them. The part to which I allude is that where the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſer charges the Preſident with having influenced the judiciary depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I know of no charge which can be more injurious to the Preſident than that of an attempt to influence a court of judicature: the judicature of the country is of the greateſt conſequence to the liberties and exiſtence of a nation. If your conſtitution was deſtroyed, ſo long as the judiciary department remained free and uncontrouled, the liberties of the people would not be endangered. (<note n="H" place="bottom">So, provided our Judges are upright, the Liberties of the People would not be endangered tho' our L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The traverſer ſays that this interference was a ſtretch of authority that the monarch of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain would have ſhrunk from; an interference without precedent, againſt law and againſt mercy. Is not this an attack, and a moſt ſerious attack on the character of the Preſident?</p>
                           <p>The traverſer goes on thus—
<q>This melancholy caſe of Jonathan Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, a native citizen of America, forcibly impreſſed by the Britiſh, and delivered with the advice of Mr. Adams to the mock trial of a Britiſh court-martial, had not yet aſtoniſhed the republican citizens of this free country!

fully apprized before the election, and they SHALL be.</q>
Now gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, there are circumſtances in this publication which greatly aggravate the offence—The traverſer does not only tell you that the Preſident inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to influence a court of juſtice without precedent againſt law and againſt mercy; but that he ſo interfered in order to deliver up a native American citizen to be executed by a Britiſh court-martial <hi>under a mock trial,</hi> againſt law and againſt mercy. Another circumſtance is adduced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the picture—He tells you that this Robbins was not only an American, but a native American, forcibly impreſſed by the Britiſh; and yet that the Preſident of the United States, without precedent, againſt law and againſt mercy, interfered with a court of juſtice, and ordered this native American to be delivered up to a mock trial by a Britiſh court-martial. I can ſcarcely conceive a charge can be made againſt the Preſident of ſo much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or of a more heinous nature. But, ſays Mr. Cooper, he has done it: I will ſhew you the caſe in which he has done it—It is the caſe of Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Robbins. It appears then that this is a charge on the Preſident, not only falſe and ſcandalous, but evidently made with intent to injure his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and the manner in which it is made is well calculated to operate on the paſſions of Americans, and I fear ſuch has been the effect. If this charge were true, there is not a man amongſt you but would hate the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident; I am ſure I ſhould hate him myſelf if I had thought he had done this. Upon the purity and independence of the judges depends the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your government and the preſervation of your liberties. They ſhould be under no influence—they are only accountable to God and their own conſciences—your preſent judges are in that ſituation.</p>
                           <p>There is a little circumſtance which the attorney-general in his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you omitted to ſtate, (<note n="I" place="bottom">In England the Judge is conſidered not as the accuſer but rather as the advocate for a defendant on a proſecution; even where he has counſel.—But I never knew him ſupply the omiſſions of an Attorney General, and argue the cauſe againſt a priſoner, and dwell upon every minute circumſtance of aggravation.</note>) but which I think it right to recall to your recollection, as it appears with what deſign the traverſer made this publication. In this alluſion to Jonathan Robbins he expreſsly tells you this is
<q>a caſe too little known, but of which the people ought to be fully apprized before the election, and they <hi>ſhall</hi> be.</q>
Here then the evident deſign of the traverſer was, to arouſe the people againſt the Preſident ſo as to influence their minds againſt him on the next election. I think it right to explain this to you, becauſe it proves, that the traverſer was actuated by improper motives to make this charge againſt the Preſident. (<note n="K" place="bottom">I never knew before that it was criminal to diſcuſs the political conduct of a public character to influence the public either for or againſt ſuch public character.

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037249_0047_100C9D57EDCA8CA8"/>
It is a very heavy charge, and made with intent to bring the Preſident into contempt and diſrepute, and excite againſt him the hatred of the people of the United States.</p>
                           <p>The traverſer has read in evidence a report made by the Preſident to the houſe of repreſentatives and a letter written by the ſecretary of ſtate to ſhew that the preſident had adviſed and directed this Robbins to be given up; but ſubſequent facts could not excuſe the traverſer for what he had written before. (<note n="L" place="bottom">I appeal to the legal public whether this be law: whether the iſſue being TRUE or not TRUE, any competent evidence to prove the truth, does not go to iſſue.</note>)</p>
                           <p>Now, gentlemen, with regard to this delivery of Jonathan Robbins, I am clearly of opinion that the Preſident could not refuſe to deliver him up. This ſame Jonathan Robbins, whoſe real name appears to have been Naſh, (<note n="M" place="bottom">How does the Judge know this? is there any thing like <hi>proof</hi> of this in the Preſident's Meſſage? Is the bare aſſertion of Mr Pickering at ſecond, third, or fourth hand, concluſive evidence? or is this taken as a matter of notoriety? Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole of Mr Rawle's reply, and the Judge's charge, a number of political and other facts are taken for granted <hi>upon the ground of notoriety,</hi> of which not a particle the of evidence appeared on the trial.</note>) was charged with murder committed on board the Hermione Britiſh ſhip of war. This Naſh being diſcovered in America, the Britiſh miniſter made a requiſition to the Preſident that he ſhould be delivered up. Then we muſt enquire whether the Preſident was obliged to give him up? By the 27th article of the treaty with Great-Britain, it is ſtipulated,
<q>that either of the contracting parties will deliver up to juſtice all perſons who being charged with murder or forgery committed within the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of either, ſhall ſeek an aſylum within any of the countries of the other, provided this ſhall be done only on ſuch evidence of criminality as according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or perſon ſo charged ſhall be found, would juſtify his apprehenſion and commitment for trial, if the offence had been there committed.</q>
If the Preſident therefore, by this treaty was bound to give this Naſh up to juſtice he was ſo bound by law; for the treaty is the law of the land: if ſo, the charge of interference to influence the deciſions of a court of juſtice, is without foundation: the reaſon why this article was inſerted in the treaty is evident —Murder is a crime againſt the laws of God and man, and ought never to be committed with impunity. Forgery is an offence affecting all commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial countries, and ſhould never go unpuniſhed; and therefore every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, eſpecially a commercial one, acts wiſely in delivering fugitives guilty of ſuch crimes to juſtice. Naſh was charged with having committed murder on board a Britiſh ſhip of war: now a diſpute has ariſen whether murder (<note n="N" place="bottom">I ſhall take an opportunity preſently of recalling to the Judge's recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what <hi>he ought</hi> to have ſtated to the jury, that the charge was piracy as well as murder.</note>) committed on board ſuch a ſhip of war was committed within the juriſdiction of Great-Britain, I have no doubt as to the point.— All veſſels, whether public or private, are part of the territory and within the juriſdiction of the nation to which they belong. This is according to the law of nations.—All nations have this juriſdiction, and the reaſon is
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037249_0048_100C9D59CA642800"/>
obvious, for every country carrying on commerce is anſwerable to other nations for the conduct of their ſubjects on the ocean. Were it not ſo, crimes committed on board veſſels of war would go unpuniſhed; for no other country can claim juriſdiction. This perſon then was charged with murder committed on board a Britiſh ſhip of war. I ſay it was committed within the juriſdiction of Great Britain. By the conſtitution (ſince the treaty is the law of the land) America was bound to give him up: but who is the perſon to deliver up a fugitive according to that article in the treaty? The preſident was the only perſon to take the proper ſteps and to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the buſineſs—He repreſents the United States in their concerns with foreign powers: this affair could not be tried before a court of law— No court of juſtice here has juriſdiction over the crime of murder commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on board a Britiſh ſhip of war. Now, as a requiſition was made to the Preſident on the part of the Britiſh government to deliver this man up, it became neceſſary to know whether there was ſufficient evidence of his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minality purſuant to the treaty.—The judge of the court of Carolina was therefore called upon to inquire into the evidence of his criminality: he was the inſtrument made uſe of by the Preſident to aſcertain that fact: (<note n="O" place="bottom">Is this true?

No: the application of Mr. Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Was this then an interference on the part of the Preſident with the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary without precedent, againſt law and againſt mercy; for doing an act which he was bound by the law of the land to carry into effect and over which a court of juſtice had no juriſdiction? (<note n="P" place="bottom">Yet the Supreme Court ſeems to have thought otherwiſe in the United States, vs. Judge Laurence.</note>) Surely not; neither has it merited to be treated in the manner in which the traverſer has done in his publication—A defence of greater novelty I never heard before.</p>
                           <p>Take this publication in all its parts, and it is the boldeſt attempt I have known to poiſon the minds of the people. He aſſerts that Mr. Adams has countenanced a Navy, that he has brought forward meaſures for raiſing a ſtanding army in the country.—The traverſer is certainly a ſcholar, and has ſhewn himſelf a man of learning, and has read much on the ſubject of armies. But to aſſert, as he has done, that we have a ſtanding army in this country, betrays the moſt egregious ignorance, or the moſt wilful inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to deceive the public. (<note n="Q" place="bottom">I ſhall conſider th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who raiſes them? Congreſs. Who pays them? The people. We have alſo another army, called the proviſional army which is enliſted during the exiſtence of the war with France—neither of theſe can with any propriety
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037249_0049_100C9D5BEDD11C58"/>
be called a ſtanding army—In fact we cannot have a ſtanding army in this country, the Conſtitution having expreſsly declared that no appropriation ſhall be made for the ſupport of an army longer than two years—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Congreſs may appropriate money for the ſupport of the army annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and are obliged to do it only for two years, there can be no ſtanding army in this country until the Conſtitution is firſt deſtroyed.</p>
                           <p>There is no ſubject on which the people of America feel more alarm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than the eſtabliſhment of a ſtanding army. Once perſuade them that the government is attempting to promote ſuch a meaſure, and you deſtroy their confidence in the government. Therefore to ſay, that under the auſpices of the Preſident, we were ſaddled with a ſtanding army, was directly calculated to bring him into contempt with the people, and excite their hatred againſt him.</p>
                           <p>It is too much to preſs this point on the Traverſer. But he deſerves it. This publication is evidently intented to miſlead the ignorant, and inflame their minds againſt the Preſident, and to influence their votes on the next election.</p>
                           <p>The Traverſer ſays, he has proved that the Preſident has advocated a ſtanding army—how has he proved it? There is no ſtanding army; I have before ſtated the army is only raiſed for five years, and during the exiſting differences—He tells you, Mr. Adams is a friend to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a navy—I wonder who is not a friend to a navy which is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the commerce and power of this country.</p>
                           <p>The Traverſer has, to prove theſe points, read to you many extracts from the addreſſes and anſwers to the Preſident. He has ſelected a number of paſſages which he aſſerts, prove the approbation of the Preſident to the creation of a navy, and forming a ſtanding army. But we are to recollect gentlemen, that when in conſequence of the unjuſt proceeding of France, the great maſs of the people thought proper to addreſs the Preſident, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing in thoſe addreſſes ſentiments of attachment and confidence in the Preſident, and their determination to refill the oppreſſion of the French government: the Preſident replied to them in anſwers which generally were the echo of their ſentiments, and in fact his expreſſions were as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as the nature of the addreſſes would permit—Therefore the Traverſer ought to have blamed the addreſſers, and not the Preſident. The Marine Society of Boſton, as old ſeamen, addreſs the Preſident in favour of a navy, the Preſident in reply thinks a navy is the proper defence of the country.</p>
                           <p>I believe, gentlemen, in the firſt part of my charge I made remarks on the aſſertions of the Traverſer, that the Preſident had borrowed momey at 8 per cent. in time of peace. Therefore it will not be neceſſary to enlarge on that point.</p>
                           <p>You will pleaſe to notice, gentlemen, that the Traverſer in his defence muſt prove every charge he has made to be true; he muſt prove it to the marrow. If he aſſerts three things, and proves but one, he fails—If he proves but two, he fails in his defence, for he muſt prove the whole of his aſſertions to be true. If he were to prove that the Preſident had done every thing charged againſt him in the firſt paragraph of the publication— though he ſhould prove to your ſatisfaction, that the Preſident had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfered
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:037249_0050_100C9D5F9694EDF8"/>
to influence the deciſions of a court of juſtice, that he had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up Jonathan Robbins without precedent, againſt law and againſt mercy, this would not be ſufficient, unleſs he proved at the ſame time, that Jonathan Robbins was a native American, and had been forcibly impreſſed, and compelled to ſerve on board a Britiſh ſhip of war.—If he fails there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, gentlemen, in this proof, you muſt then conſider w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If you believe that he has publiſhed it without malice or an intent to defame the Preſident of the United States, you muſt acquit him—If he has proved the truth of the facts aſſerted by him you muſt find him Not Guilty.</p>

                  <p>The court have deſired me to offer any thing relating to my circumſtances in mitigation of the fine, or any obſervation that occurs to me in extenuation of the offence. I have thought it my duty (not for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of deprecating any puniſhment which the court may deem it proper to inflict, but) to prevent any accidental or apparent harſhneſs of puniſhment on part of the court, for want of that information which it is in my power to give. For this reaſon therefore, and that the court may not be miſled, I think it right to ſay that my property in this country is moderate. That ſome reſources I had in England, commercial failures there, have lately cut off: that I depend principally on my practice: that practice impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will annihilate. Be it ſo. I have been accuſtomed to make ſacrifices to opinion, and I can make this. As to circumſtances in extenuation, not being conſcious that I have ſet down ought in malice, I have nothing to extenuate.</p>

                  <p>If we were to indulge our own ideas, there is room to ſuſpect that in caſes of this kind, where one party is againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, gentlemen who write for that party would be indemnified againſt any pecuniary loſs; and that the party ſhould pay any fine which might be impoſed on the perſon convicted. You muſt know, I ſuppoſe, before you made any publication of this kind, whether you were to be ſupported by a party or not, and whether you would not be indemnified againſt any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary loſs—if the fine were only to fall on yourſelf, I would conſider your circumſtances, but if I could believe you were ſupported by a party inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the government, and that <hi>they</hi> were to pay the fine, not you, I would go to the utmoſt extent of the power of the court. I underſtand you have a family, but you have not thought proper to ſtate that to the court. From what I can gather from you, it appears, that you depend on your profeſſion for ſupport—we do not wiſh to impoſe ſo rigorous a fine as to be beyond a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons abilities to ſupport, but the government muſt be ſecured againſt theſe malicious attacks. You ſay that you are not conſcious of having acted from malicious motives. It may be ſo; ſaying ſo, we muſt believe you— but the jury have found otherwiſe: you are a gentleman of the profeſſion, of ſuch capacity and knowledge, as to have it more in your power to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead the ignorant. I do not want to oppreſs, but I will reſtrain, as far as I can all ſuch licentious attacks on the government of the country.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Cooper.</speaker>
                  <p>I have been aſked by the court whether in caſe of a fine being impoſed upon me, I ſhall be ſupported by a party—Sir I ſolemnly aver that throughout my life, here and elſewhere, among all the political queſtions in which I have been concerned, I have never ſo far demeaned myſelf as to be a party writer. I never was in the pay, or under the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any party—there is no party in this or any other country, that can offer me a temptation to proſtitute my pen.—If there are any perſons here who are acquainted with what I have publiſhed, they muſt feel and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that I have had higher and better motives, than a party could ſuggeſt. I have written to the beſt of my ability, what I have ſeriouſly thought would conduce to the general good of mankind. The exertions of my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents ſuch as they are, have been unbought, and ſo they ſhall continue— they have indeed been paid for, but they have been paid for by myſelf, and by myſelf only, and ſometimes dearly. The public is my debtor, and what I have paid or ſuffered for them, if my duty ſhould again call upon me to write or to act, I ſhall again moſt readily ſubmit to. I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have no party opinions, to have no predilection for particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciptions of men or of meaſures; but I do not act upon minor conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: I belong here as in my former country to the great party of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. With regard to any offers which may have been made to me to enable me to diſcharge the fine which may be impoſed, I will ſtate candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the court what has paſſed, for I wiſh not to conceal the truth: I have had no previous communication or promiſe whatever, I have ſince had no ſpecific promiſes of money or any thing elſe. I wrote from my own ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions. But many of my friends have in the expectation of a verdict
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:037249_0052_100C9D612DA11378"/>
againſt me, come forward with general offers of pecuniary aſſiſtance: theſe offers I have hitherto neither accepted nor rejected. If the court ſhould impoſe a fine beyond my ability to pay, I ſhall accept them without heſitation, but if the fine be within my circumſtances to diſcharge. I ſhall pay it myſelf: But the inſinuations of the court are ill founded, and if you ſir, from miſapprehenſion, or miſinformation have been tempted to make them, your miſtake ſhould be corrected.</p>

            <p>The modern practice in Europe with reſpect to the employment of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armies, has created ſuch a maſs of opinion in their favour, that even
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:037249_0053_100C9D62E8359FF8"/>
philoſophers and the advocates of liberty have frequently confeſſed their uſe and neceſſity in certain caſes.</p>
            <p>But whoever ſeriouſly and candidly eſtimates the power of diſcipline and the tendency of military habits, will be conſtrained to confeſs, that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may be the efficacy of a ſtanding army in war, it cannot in peace be conſidered as friendly to the rights of human nature, &amp;c. But any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this head may be conſidered as unneceſſary to the enlightened Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States.</p>
            <p>A ſmall corps of well diſciplined and well informed Artileriſts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers, and a legion for the protection of the frontiers and the magazines and arſenals, are <hi>all</hi> the <hi>military eſtabliſhment</hi> which may be required for the preſent uſe of the United States.—The <hi>privates</hi> of the Corps to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted for a certain period, and after the expiration of which to return to the maſs of the people.</p>
            <p>Page 7. An <hi>energetic national militia</hi> is to be regarded as the <hi>capital ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of a free republic; and not a <hi>ſtanding</hi> army, forming a diſtinct claſs in the community.</p>
            <p>It is the introduction and diffuſion of vice and corruption of manners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the maſs of the people, that renders a ſtanding army neceſſary.—It is when public ſpirit is deſpiſed, and avarice, indolence and effeminacy of manners predominate, and prevent the eſtabliſhment of inſtitutions which would elevate the minds of the youth in the paths of virtue and honour, that a ſtanding army is formed and rivetted for ever, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be decided to reject a ſtanding army for the military branch of the government, as poſſeſſing too fierce an aſpect, and being hoſtile to the principles of liberty, it will follow that a well-conſtituted militia ought to be eſtabliſhed, &amp;o.</p>
            <p>Such were the ſentiments of General Waſhington's Secretary at war.— Let us now turn to the opinions of Mr. Adam's Secretary at war.</p>
            <p>I have already noticed the report of the Secretary at war, of December 24th. 1798, and the force therein mentioned, of 50,000 men.</p>
            <p>In his report tranſmitted by the Preſident to Congreſs 13th. January 1800, there is an elaborate plan for a military Academy: he ſtates the expence of the two regiments of artilleriſts and engineers, as they now ſtand <hi>on the eſtabliſhment.</hi> (page 23)—He ſubmits the preceding plan as eſſential to the improvement of our military eſtabliſhment. (page 24)—He conſiders the volunteer aſſociations as a reſerve body to reinforce our <hi>regular army</hi> — He recommends enliſtments for 5 years in future, if it ſhould be deemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to <hi>keep up</hi> a peace eſtabliſhment more extended than before (page 27)—He ſtates in page 35 the poſitions of the exiſting regular force, and ſpeaks of the four regiments of Infantry and the two companies of Cavalry on the <hi>permanent eſtabliſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His letter (13th. February 1800) to the chairman of the Committee of Congreſs on ſo much of the ſpeech of the Preſident as relate to a <hi>a ſyſtem of national defence,</hi> is a laboured expoſition of the inutility and inefficacy of a militia, and the abſurdity of relying on this means of defence.—In the very outſet he declares
<q>That it is not conceived the United States will ever be diſpoſed to place their reliance for defence againſt a foreign invading ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on militia alone, but that they will <hi>at all times maintain a body of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular troops</hi> commenſurate with their ability to maintain them.</q>
Page 5 and 6 of that letter are occupied in arguments againſt the malitia ſyſtem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:037249_0054_100C9D65F2AA5A28"/>
the whole letter is a recommendation of a permanent eſtabliſhment of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar troops.—The reports are recommended to the ſerious conſiderations of Congreſs by Preſident Adams; and the letter to the Chairman, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on that part of the Preſident's ſpeech which gave riſe to the Committee.</p>
            <p>From theſe extracts the public muſt draw their own concluſions.—Had I produced <hi>all</hi> the evidence in my power on the various charges in the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the day would hardly have ſufficed for the defence; and the patience and attention of the Court the Jury, the auditors and myſelf, would have been exhauſted long before the cloſe.</p>
            <p>The troops on the permanent eſtabliſhment or what Judge Chaſe would call the five year army are now enliſted for five years <hi>from the date of their enliſtment</hi>

               <q>The French revolution has ever been incomprehenſible to me. The ſubſtance of all I can underſtand of it is, that one of the pillars of the ancient monarchy, that is the army, has fallen upon the other two, the nobility and clergy, and broken them both down; the building has fallen of courſe, and this pillar is now the whole edifice. The military ſupport has ſwallowed that of Adam and all the reſt. If the example ſhould be followed through Europe, when the officers of the armies begin to quarrel with one another, five hundred years more of Baron's wars may ſucceed. If the French therefore will become the enemies of all mankind by forcing all nations to follow their example, in the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all the political, religious and ſocial inſtitutions, which time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and freedom, have ſanctioned, they ought to be oppoſed by every country that has any pretenſions to principle, ſpirit and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm.</q>

<q>As I have ever wiſhed to avoid as far as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and prudence would admit, every concealment from my fellow-citizens of my real ſentiments in matters of importance, I will venture to aſk you whether it is conſiſtent with the peace we have made, the friendſhip we have ſtipulated, or even with civility to expreſs a marked reſentment to a foreign power (Great-Britain) who is at war with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe ill will we experience every day, and who will very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in a few weeks, be acknowledged an enemy in the ſenſe of the law of nations: a power too which invariably acknowledged us to be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for 15 years; a power that has never had the inſolence to reject your ambaſſadors; a power that at preſent convoys your trade and their own at the ſame time.</q>

            <p>I ſhall cloſe this collection with the Preſident's famous deſcription of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government. He had already told the Boſton Marine Society that the French revolution had ever been incomprehenſible to him.</p>

<q>But when ſhe denounced her God, and paid a mock of adoration to a harlot; when ſhe murdered or baniſhed without cauſe or without trial her beſt citizens; when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of uſing her arms in her own defence, ſhe invaded, conquered and pillaged weak and divided ſtates around her, our charity was loſt in the enormity of her crimes, and ſober men preſaged to us that a nation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarding all ties of religion and morality, and the obſervance of its own conſtitution and laws, would &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>

<q>The words republican government which never have been and never can be generally diſgraced in the minds of men without danger of univerſal deſpotiſm have impoſed on many who had very imperfect ideas under them: as there are none in our language more indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, they may be interpreted to mean any thing. A republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for 30 millions of people muſt be very well digeſted, or it wl be

more arbitary and tyrannical than deſpotiſm itſelf. The monarchy of France was freedom in compariſon with anarchy.</q>
The public muſt judge how far theſe ſpecimens of irritating language are defenſible. Might they not as well have been avoided? Is it from ſuch expreſſions that Mr. Adams can claim to be re elected to the Preſidency of a republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>

            <p>I do not know of any <hi>legal</hi> proof that Fenno's paper is under the controul of the cabinet here, or that Cobbett was paid by the Britiſh Miniſter. Mr. Talleyrand however is not the only perſon who has made a ſimilar accuſation as to theſe papers. On the 29th of March 1798 Mr. Giles, in Congreſs, ſaid,
<q>Gentlemen talked of news-papers, he would ſay a word on that ſubject: there are two papers in this city which not only breathe defenſive but offenſive war of the worſt kind. One of theſe papers he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved was particularly countenanced by the governmenr. The other was printed by infamous ſcoundrel, a Britiſh ſubject, a paper which he was ſorry to find much countenanced. This paper not only breathes war, but exterminating war. And this paper iſſuing from a Britiſh preſs, ſpreads its baneful influence through the country- He proclaimed this fact, and he ſhould think himſelf a traitor to his country if he did not proclaim it.</q>
This extract is to be found in Porcupine's Gazette of April 3, 1798, and in Fenno's Gazette of March 31 1798, without remark or contradiction in either.</p>
            <p>The preliminary queſtion to which I alluded, when <hi>I</hi> moved for a Subpoena for the Preſident, was the authority of Fenno's Gazette, which I wanted to quote; and I wiſhed for the teſtimony of the Preſident to that point, that I might bring the evidence of that paper ſtill more compleatly within the caſe of Rex vs. Holt, 5 T. Rep. 442. The Preſident however eſcaped the train of queſtions which this ſubject would have brought on.</p>
            <p>The pamphlet alluded to by Mr. Talleyrand, ſeems to have been that ſcurrilous production of Cobbett Le Gros Mousquiton Diplomatique, or the Diplomatic Blunderbuſs: a ſatire on Mr. Adet, the then French miniſter to the United States. The advertiſement of his pamphlet with ſtill more inſulting language, in Brown's Philadelphia Gazette of Nov. 26 1796, is now before me.</p>

               <hi>In the True American of April <hi>14 1800,</hi> Mr.Gallatin, whoſe caution as well as acuteneſs is ſufficiently well known to the public, is ſtated to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf to this purpoſe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Danbury certificates ſo much relied on amounted only to negative proof which was no proof whatever; and in oppoſition, if not to theſe certificates, at leaſt to the inferences drawn from them, he would ſay that he had informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from authority ſufficient to have convinced him and ſufficient to juſtify his repeating it on this floor, that there had been a family, by the name of Robbins, living either in the town of Danbury or in its immediate neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, altho' they had removed many years ago to another ſtate; that the man calling himſelf Jonathan Robbins, if he did really belong to that family, ſhould have ſuppoſed the place of his birth to be Danbury, although it might be the next town to it, that he ſhould have made the miſtake in his relation to a
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037249_0057_100C9D6C69E66508"/>
"place which he had left in his infancy, could by no means invalidate his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. On the other hand, if the man who had been delivered up did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to that family, if he was not Robbins, but Naſh the Iriſhman, how bad it happened that he ſhould ſo ſtrangely have gueſſed at the place where the family whoſe name he had aſſumed had reſided perhaps more than twenty years before? He, the ſuppoſed Naſh, in the firſt place obtains a notarial protection dated at New-York in <hi>1795,</hi> by the name of and ſigned Jonathan Robbins, ſtating him to be a native of Connecticut, but without ſpecifying the town. In <hi>1799</hi> in open court before Judge Bee, his, the ſuppoſed Naſh's hand writing appears ſimilar to the ſignature of Robbins affixed to the notarial protection; he at the ſame time, by his affidavit, deſignates the town of Connecticut, where he pretends to have been born; and although that town was not deſignated in the protection he muſt be ſuppoſed to have obtained fraudulently, yet he divines either the identical town where a Robbins family had formerly reſided, or one adjoining to it."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This led me to make further enquiry, and I had reaſon to believe that Mr. J. Davenport was capable of giving information reſpecting the uncertain limits of the town of Danbury at the time when Robbins might be preſumed to have lived there, and even that ſuch a family did formerly live in the town or the neighbourhood. I find on ſubſequent enquiry that Col. Lyon has not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed directly with the brother of Jonathan Robbins, but that his neighbour Dr. Shaw has converſed with a man of the name of Robbins, who declared himſelf to have lived formerly near Danbury, who had a brother named Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, whom he underſtood went to ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a very ſingular fact, that an illiterate Iriſhman ſhould be ſo well able to conceal the tone and dialect of his country, as to paſs for a moment for a Connecticut man? And yet while the cauſe was pending before Judge Bee, the prima facie evidence was, that he was an American. The brogue has never yet been urged in proof.</hi>

               <hi>I take this opportunity of mentioning that the other members of the Houſe of Repreſentatives were called, in expectation that it would be neceſſary for me, (as Mr. Gales the ſhort-hand writer is in North Carolina) to authenticate cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain declarations and expreſſions in the Congreſſional Regiſter which I had mark'd for uſe, and to give information on ſome other points which I fully intended to have brought forward.

(Printed by Carey, Philadelphia) will be ſatisfied that the queſtion about the common law forming a part of the law of the United States, is ſettled as far as ſound argument can ſettle it.</note> judge Peters admits it—you incline to iſſue but not to enforce, ſubpoenas to mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Legiſlature; judge Peters is againſt iſſuing a proceſs he cannot enforce—you, think it right not only to take for granted the exiſtence of political parties, but thro' my fine, to tax the one in favour of the other; judge Peters more wiſely, does not preſume to know any thing but what paſſes in Court, or to care whether I pay a fine with the Money in my pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, or with the Money I may borrow—Both of ye in my caſe, (like the Senate in Duane's) determined a new point without condeſcending to hear argument upon it: You did the ſame afterward in the caſe of Fries, by pre-determining with the deliberation of a written opinion, the legal queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treaſon; and yet the next day your recalled you papers, withdrew your refuſal to hear counſel on the point, and preſſed them againſt your own ſolemn deciſion, to tread without fear, the forbidden ground. After
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:037249_0059_100C9D728DA43000"/>
differences of opinion ſo repeated and ſo recent—after conduct ſo wavering and indeciſive, I may ſafely venture to aſſert that your inſinuations reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my legal capacity may be controverted without preſumption. While I am in court, I know it is my duty, and I feel it my inclination to ſubmit with deference to the <hi>ex Cathedra</hi> deciſions you are authorized to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce; but that deference to the conſtitutional expounders of the laws, does not deprive me of the right to call up in ſelf defence their erroneous opinions before the more ſolemn tribunal of the Public.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to the points of difference between us.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I claimed a right to the attendance of the Preſident under proceſs of the court.</p>
                  <p>When an opinion is once ſettled by the deliberate deciſion of a court, I think the Judges are right not to permit counſel to travel over beaten ground, or to re-urge the arguments and objections that have been already maturely conſidered and ſettled: it was for this reaſon I declined making any objection to the conſtitutionality of the ſedition law, though I had no doubt of the validity of that objection. But I appeal to common ſenſe and to profeſſional experience, whether it is either proper or uſual for a court to decide a <hi>new</hi> and a doubtful point, without hearing argument, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted by a party concerned? Whether the deciſion of the court was right or not, your refuſal to hear me on the ſubject, cannot be defended. Patience is required in a judge at all times, particularly on the deciſion of new caſes, particularly toward a defendant on an indictment, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly when he pleads for himſelf. All theſe conſiderations ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced you to have liſtened to the following obſervations that then occurred to me.</p>
                  <p>Your objection was, that being an indictment for a falſe and malicious libel againſt the Preſident, he could not be called upon to give teſtimony at all: for it was improper to ſubject him to queſtions that might make him accuſe himſelf of mal-adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p>I reply firſt, that the Preſident is not the proſecutor here. That there is no ground for conſidering him as a legal party to this indictment, and it might be brought without his conſent. It is not the United States on the proſecution of the Preſident againſt Thomas Cooper, but the United States on the proſecution of the Attorney General <hi>ex officio,</hi> againſt Thomas Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Not being a party therefore, he might be examined.</p>
                  <p>I ſay ſecondly, that it is ſtill further evident that he is not legally a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for I could not demand, on ſuch an indictment, to have a proſecutor indorſed.</p>
                  <p>I ſay thirdly, that <hi>ex-officio</hi> informations may lie, where the Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral has a right to call upon the perſon injured to ſupport the proſecution by giving teſtimony on behalf of the United States: and farther that proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or indictments are liable to be croſs-examined by a defendant, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are called as evidences, (as they very commonly are) in ſupport of their own proſecution. So that the objections of your honour would avail in a conſiderable degree againſt common and known practice: but as I doubt whether they could be croſs-examined out of the examination in chief, I do not reſt on this argument.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the queſtions put, need not have been ſuch as would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any legal crimination by the anſwers. For inſtance, ſuppoſe I had aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037249_0060_100C847492D3B7A8"/>
the Preſident, did you direct the preſent proſecution? did Mr. Stoddart conſult you on his report reſpecting the Navy? Was you privy to and did you approve of Colonel Mc'Henry's reports on the army? Did Mr. Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton or any perſon on the part of Great Britain, apply to you under the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the delivery of the Hermione ſailors, tried before Judge Chaſe in the Jerſeys? was there any communication between you and Judge Bee, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to Mr. Liſtons letter? Were you appriſed of the caſe of the United States vs. Judge Lawrence? Surely the anſwers to thoſe and many other queſtions relevant to the iſſue that might be framed, need not have inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any legal crimination. For that is the point: a man is not relieved from a queſtion becauſe it may tend to ſhew that he has been miſtaken or faulty; if the anſwer does not ſubject him to legal reproof, the queſtion may be put.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I think I had a clear right to his evidence on a preliminary and collateral queſtion; for inſtance, as we have no Gazette as yet printed by <hi>Royal</hi> authority in this country, I wanted to ſhew that the Preſident had countenanced and given authenticity to Fenno's Gazette. I wanted to bring my evidence completely within Rex v Holt. The Preſident I believe could have enabled me to do this, and ſurely ſuch queſtions as this point would have required, could not be objected to as within the reaſon of your deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Nor did your own ideas on the light in which the Preſident was to be conſidered ſeem quite clear: This rejecttion of his teſtimony evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently goes on the ſuppoſition that he would have appeared too much in the character of a proſecutor, and yet you decided that I was miſtaken in conſidering him in that light. But your honour miſtook me: I knew that he was not the legal, but I had a right to look upon him as the actual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor.</p>
                  <p>I know that men of eminence at the bar think you were wrong in deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the point againſt me; but it may admit of doubt, for the caſe is new, and no analogous caſe <hi>can</hi> occur under Fox's Libel Bill.</p>
                  <p>But can it admit of doubt whether you ought to have heard arguments on ſo new a point?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. You denied that I had any right to copies of official documents.— You ſaid you knew of no <hi>law</hi> that would entitle me to them.</p>
                  <p>Be good enough Judge Chaſe to read the following extracts from the act of Congreſs entitled
<q>An act to provide for the ſafe keeping of the acts, records, and ſeals of the United States and for other purpoſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Approved September 15th. 1789.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <q>Sect. 5 The ſaid Secretary (of State) ſhall cauſe a ſeal of office to be made for the ſaid department (of State) of ſuch device as the Preſident of the United States ſhall approve; and all copies of records and papers in the ſaid office, authenticated under the ſaid ſeal ſhall be evidence equally as the original record or paper.</q>
The next ſection preſcribes the fees to be paid by perſons requiring copies, viz. 10 cents per 100 words, and 25 cents for the ſeal.</p>
                  <p>I take the liberty of referring you next to the caſe of Rex vs. Holt. 5 T. R. 442. ſo often quoted, wherein Lord Kenyon declares
<q>That the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette is evidence of many acts of ſtate, cannot be doubted.***** Theſe
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037249_0061_100C9D75F5159980"/>
are acts done by and to the King in his regal character: they are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of different bodies of ſubjects going to offer their loyalty at the foot of the throne and received by the King in his public capacity.— <hi>They then become acts of State,</hi> and of ſuch acts announced to the public in the gazette, the gazette is evidence in courts of juſtice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I had a right to demand copies of theſe as PUBLIC PAPERS.</p>
                  <p>Take the trouble of reading the following determination of Dr. James Marriot in the caſe of the Ship Columbus.—Collect. Jurid. page 68.
<q>On the opening of this cauſe it was ſuggeſted by the counſel for Mr. Le Meſurier, that frequent applications had been made by him to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for a copy of the order of counſel.—Now if ſuch an order had exiſted and had been produced it would have prevented this flood of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation. Mr. Le Meſurier would not have heard ſo many brilliant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments either for or againſt himſelf, nor the court have had the fatigue of watching them with extraordinary attention.—In any cauſe, where the crown is a party, it is to be obſerved, <hi>that the Crown</hi> can no more <hi>withhold</hi> evidence of documents in its poſſeſſion <hi>than a private</hi> perſon.— If the court thinks proper to order the production of any public inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that order muſt be obeyed.—It wants no Inſignia of authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Crown.—The order will enforce itſelf.—For if a party <hi>ſuing refuſes to produce a neceſſary document,</hi> what follows? He ſhall take nothing by his petition.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this was before me on the table; the reference marked.—Why did I not quote it? Becauſe I ſhould have been again liable to the charge of impropriety and indecency and perhaps with additional reproach, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain venturing to doubt your honours deciſion—We are now before the public—let them judge whether you or I more deſerve the profeſſional ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms you thought fit to aim at me.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The documents I read ſeemed permitted on the part of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours rather as a matter of indulgence than of right. I was without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and you were graciouſly pleaſed to permit <hi>me</hi> to ſay and to quote many things that a profeſſional advocate would have been reſtrained from. The chief evidence I wanted was Fenno's paper; in which all my quotations were marked; though I uſed the ſelection of addreſſes for temporary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſay, I was <hi>not</hi> obliged to your honours for the permiſſion to read Fenno's paper—For 1ſt, I contend ſtill that on a <hi>political</hi> trial that evidence to which the public conſtantly reſorts is <hi>prima facie</hi> evidence to go to a jury. 2dly, Fenno's Gazette approaches ſo near to the caſe of a Royal Gazette that it is hardly diſtinguiſhable. It is a paper approbatory of the meaſures of government. Fenno is printer to the ſenate; and had I not been reſtrained from examining the Preſident, I think I could have proved that Fenno was his printer too. But 4thly, <hi>it was the beſt evidence the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the circumſtances would admit,</hi> for the higher grades of evidence were refuſed me by your honours' deciſion, and by the illiberal conduct of Mr. Adams. If I was interdicted from procuring better, this became the beſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. You denied the Preſident's meſſage to be evidence, becauſe I had it not by me at the time I wrote.—I think this objection is founded on a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the iſſue, which was, <hi>true or not true</hi> generally; without reference
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037249_0062_100C9D77B17B1188"/>
to time. But having dwelt on this before I ſhall not repeat my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. My allegation that the <hi>notoriety</hi> of political fact, was a proper cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to be judged of by the jury, ſeemed evidently by your manner, to be permitted out of indulgence and compaſſion, while on my part I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to what paſſed, out of deference to the high character with which you were cloathed; but a man muſt be very ill read in the trials for ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and muſt very careleſsly have attended to Mr. Rawle's ſpeech and your charge, not to be convinced that notoriety of political fact muſt ſometimes be taken for granted: how far it ought to avail, is circumſtanse to the jury. If on trial where character can be given in evidence—if on trials as in England on preſcriptive road-cauſes—if on trials reſpecting marriage, common reputation may be ſtated as evidence, how much more proper is it on the general facts of public politics. The hardſhip and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of inſiſting on ſtrict legal evidence in ſuch a caſe, is in my opinion too glaring to be enlarged upon.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. You object to charging the navy on the Preſident, and yet you muſt have known, that the meaſure was grounded on the Preſident's ſpeeches and on Mr. Stoddard's report. <hi>Qui facit per alium facit per ſe.</hi> That it is a permanent eſtabliſhment appears from the purchaſe of woods and iſlands for the uſe of the navy. See the reports and acts of Congreſs relative to the navy. But if it met with no more than his ſanction, my poſition was true, independent of the proof I adduced.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. I muſt join iſſue with you on the ſubject of the army, though I much diſlike the harſh terms wherein you have expreſſed the alternative. I think you are wrong; for, 1ſt, a ſtanding army, as I have before ſtated, is a body of troops exiſting in permanent diſcipline in contradiſtinction to the periodical diſcipline of militia forces. The term is Engliſh, uſed in this ſenſe by every author who has written on the ſubject in that country, and particularly in the legiſlative debates and the lords' proteſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, The appropriations for the ſtanding army in that country as well as the mutiny bill, are annual, as appears by the annual "Diſtribution of Grants," preſented to the houſe of commons of Great-Britain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, The ſoldiery <hi>there</hi> are enliſted for life, although the appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are annual. <hi>Here</hi> they are enliſted on the PERMANENT ESTABLISH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT (M'Henry's Rep. 13th Jan. 1800, p. 35) for five years. No man is enliſted for 1, 2, 3 or 4 years—hence there is a regular ſucceſſion and ſupply kept up. So are the inſtructions of enliſtment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, The Terms made uſe of for that army in the reports of colonel M'Henry, and in the act of congreſs entitled, "An an act to aſcertain and fix the Military eſtabliſhment of the United States," are eſtabliſhment, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent eſtabliſhment, to keep up by enliſtments, &amp;c. You ought to have known this. The five-year army is not a five-year army, but a permanent army, where every ſoldier enliſted, is enliſted for the term of five years from the date of his enliſtment.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. I cannot account for your mode of arguing the caſe of JONA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAN ROBBINS, but whoever attended the trial will be able to account why I did not examine you on the buſineſs of the Hermione ſeamen indicted for piracy before you in Jerſey. How happens it in the firſt place that you ſo ſtrangely omitted to notice the prominent charge of <hi>Piracy?</hi> A charge that came before yourſelf in the caſe of the other ſeamen of the Hermione<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="63" facs="unknown:037249_0063_100C9D79E0E8E570"/>
a charge that came before Judge Bee in Robbins's caſe, that was ſpecifically recognized by the Preſident and by Mr. Pickering in the meſſage noticed by myſelf, and which you muſt know gave indiſputable juriſdiction to the circuit court. Surely you ought to have known, and ought not to have omitted this ſtrong point.</p>
                  <p>A pirate is deſcribed as <hi>Heſtis humani Generis.</hi> Moll. l. 1. c. 4. § 1.— He is not an offender againſt a particular country, but againſt all countries, and therefore all countries have juriſdiction. This doctrine is recognized in the following caſes of Engliſh law:
<q>The king of England hath not only an empire and ſovereignty over the Britiſh ſeas for the puniſhment of piracy; but in concurrence with other Princes and States, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted juriſdiction and power in the moſt remote parts of the world. If any perſon therefore, native or foreigner, Chriſtian or infidel, Turk or pagan, with whoſe country we are in amity, trade or correſpondence, ſhall be robbed or ſpoiled in the narrow or other ſeas, whether the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, Atlantic, Southern or any blanches thereof either in this or the other ſide of the line, it is piracy within the limits and cognizance of the admiralty ſeſſions. Sir Ch. Hodge's charge. <bibl>Old Bailey 8. w. 3. Hawk. pl. c. 152, of Dublin ed. 1788.</bibl>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"The Captain of a French merchantman, having put into a port in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was accuſed by his crew of robberies on the ſeas, and fled. His ſhip and goods were conſidered as having belonged to pirates. The French conſuls preſented memorials requiring the cauſe to be remanded to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural judge, as was pretended, in France. But the king and his counſel finally adjudged that he was ſufficiently founded in point of juriſdiction, to confiſcate the ſhip and goods, and to try capitally the captain himſelf, had he been in hold; the matter of Renvoy being a thing quite diſuſed among princes; and as every man by the uſage of our European nations is <hi>juſticiable</hi> in the place where the crime is committed, ſo are pirates, being out of the protection of all laws and privileges, and to be tried in what part ſoever they are taken. 2. Wooddeſon, § 428. Sr. Leol. Jenk. Rep. 714.</p>
                  <p>The juriſdiction having thus attached to the Circuit court, and having been acted upon, ought not to have been ſurrendered at the advice or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of any man whatever.</p>
                  <p>Had the crime been murder alone, as your charge implies, I incline to think your doctrine would have been well founded. But you know, or ought to know, that where an inferior crime flows from a ſuperior, the former is merged in the latter. Thus, Treſpaſs is merged in Felony, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and Battery, in Riot. In the firſt ſection of Molloy's chapter on pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, he deſcribes a pirate as a ſea thief: hoſtis humani generis, who, to enrich himſelf, either by ſurpriſe or open force, ſets upon merchants and others trading by ſea, ever ſpoiling their lading, if they can by any means get the maſtery, <hi>ſometimes bereaving them of their lives,</hi> and ſinking their ſhips **** againſt theſe, any prince hath power to make war, though they be not ſubject to his government. Molloy L. 1. c. 4. § 1. Grot. de Jur. Belli. L. 2. c. 20. § 40.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears, that the court had juriſdiction: that the court acted upon it: that the court inſtead of deciding upon argument, adopted the opinion of the executive on two judicial queſtions: that the court liſtened
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:037249_0064_100C9D7DA3F0BEA0"/>
to and acted upon the advice and requeſt of the executive in a caſe within judicial authority.</p>
                  <p>Again. Why was it that you did not notice the very ſtrong caſe of the United States and Judge Lawrence? If it did not apply, why not ſayh ſo? If it did, why not allow its proper force? Why give room to ſuppoſe it was too ſtrong to be controverted?</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. I complain of improper conduct in your ſumming up againſt me: <hi>I</hi> ſay (ſubmitting to public opinion) that it is not a part of a judge's duty to argue a cauſe againſt a defendant on a penal proſecution—to notice the omiſſion of an Attorney General—to dwell upon circumſtances of aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—to omit ſtrong points of the defence, or to let the jury perceive a bias in the mind of the court. I ſay this is notoriouſly againſt the practice of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bench at leaſt. It might have been pleaſing to Mr. Pickering on your right hand, to Meſſrs. Read, Harper, &amp;c. on your left, to Mr. Tracy behind you, to Meſſrs. Shaw, Stoddart and Mc'Henry in front of you, but I <hi>think,</hi> the public will not regard it with the ſame encomiaſtic placidity.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. And that I may not omit any of the points of difference between us, I ſhall ſtate that, tho' your objection to the <hi>generality</hi> of my affidavit, was perhaps in ſtrictneſs of law defenſible, yet it was not conformable to the practice I have witneſſed in the courts here: where a party is not entitled according to the rules off practice, to put off a cauſe, and where an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience will ariſe to his opponent from deferring it, or where there is ground to ſuſpect intentional delay, there the courts always require a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial affidavit, going to the points that the abſent witneſſes are required to prove; but where no affectation of delay is imputable, and where a party has not claimed the cauſe to be deferred before, a general affidavit is not uſually objected to.</p>
                  <p>I had a right from the common indulgence, to have put off my trial till next term, and therefore was compleatly within the equity of what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be, the rule of practice here: but I ſhall not deny your right to inſiſt as you did, though it was certainty ſtretching the law to the utmoſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the caſe of the King v. Tandy and Morris, Feb. 12, 1799, in the King's Bench of Ireland, "the defendants were again brought up," and their counſel moved to poſtpone the trial till next term, ſtating the abſence of ſeveral material witneſſes at Hamburgh. Though in this caſe it ſhould appear that the priſoners were brought up at the ſecond term, which I was not, though the affidavit did not ſtate that the witneſſes had been ſought for or ſerved with proceſs, which mine did; although there was reaſonable doubt whether they could be procured at all—a doubt which did not exiſt in my caſe; though the offence there, was much higher than the charge againſt me, yet the attorney general objecting to the legal ſufficiency of the affidavit, allowed the trial to be put off on that ground. This caſe is reported by Brown, Phil. Gaz. April 21, 1800.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your charge of indecency for preſuming to offer arguments againſt the deciſion of the court, prevented me from uſing at that time the authorities in my power. But you have now an opportunity if you pleaſe, of deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the arena of the public, a mark of attention on my part that you owe to the ſituation you fill. You have thrown out the challenge of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional imputation and it is accepted.</p>
