            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SAGE old Solomon very wiſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that there is <hi>a time for all things;</hi> and notwithſtanding his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority many will admit there ſhould be a time for <hi>merriment.</hi> In this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable book, which is the very <hi>eſſence</hi> and <hi>quinteſſence</hi> of all mirth and jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, you will find much genuine wit, but nothing that can have a prejudicial influence upon your mind. It mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters little who you are, whether old or young, ſnarling or good-natured, pretty or ugly, crooked or ſtraight, dimple-chined or copper-noſed, a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker or a nabob; whoever you are it will moſt aſſuredly excite your laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For if your lips are even made of foal-leather, if your eyes flaſh the vengeance of Diogenes who lived in a tub, yet the paroxiſms of giggling will ſeize you as unawares as a bum-bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff; and if your ribs are not made out
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028656_0004_0FDA3D2FD5088198"/>of crow-bars you muſt certainly put them a little in motion.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould you be reſolved to be hipp'd or in the dumps? Why ſhould you proclaim war againſt yourſelf and tear your wig or gouge out your eyes in a fit of deſperation, leaſt you ſhould freeze or ſtarve to death in this world? If you are in ſuch a mopiſh habit you will here find a moſt powerful anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote to chaſe away the fumes of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. Then, if you are ſad do not ſuffer misfortune to thruſt her pitchforks of deſpair into you, for, as the ſong ſays, as light heart and a thin pair of breeches will carry us through the world, brave boys.</p>
            <p>As for the languiſhing nymph, who is up to her eye brows in love, and the deep ſighing ſwain whoſe heart is as full of holes as a riddle, they ought (for humanity's ſake) to be prevented from ſlabbering and ſnivelling at their hard fate. Not an hundred apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries ſhops, not a regiment of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:028656_0005_0FDA3CFA3756EA78"/>incluſive of quack doctors in abundance, will do them half the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that can be effected by a peruſal of this book. If they ſhould chance to be a little ſqueamiſh at the ſtomach, it will prove an excellent remedy for the ſpleen, or the belly-ach of deſpair. In a word, the Editor has written and compiled it for the benefit of thoſe who may be diſpoſed to dance and ſing; to add glee to the ſhort pittance of life, to improve the ſocial virtues; to heighten the charms of the big-bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied decanter, and to frighten haggard care and her wry faced train to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Depend upon it, Reader, that with a few glaſſes of wine in your head, a pretty laſs upon your knee and the <hi>"Feaſt of Merriment"</hi> in your hand, you will be a thouſand times happier than any monarch in the univerſe.</p>

            <head>THE FEAST OF MERRIMENT.</head>
            <p>A SCOTCH major, who had been ſo ſkillful with his ſword as to fight ſeveral duels with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſucceſs, but who, on account of his extreme deſire for quarreling when a little intoxicated, and for his boaſted courage, was deſerted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by his brother officers, came one evening into a large company. There happened to be preſent a Yankee, an officer of the ſame regiment which was then ſtationed at Montreal. This Yankee related among other things the failure of a certain expedition in which he had the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be wounded. That was becauſe you were a <hi>raſcally ſet of cowards,</hi> obſerved the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious major. You are a <hi>d—n'd liar,</hi> ſays the Yankee. The company ſtared. The Scotchman looked down upon him with as much contempt as Goliah did upon David and immediately aſked, Are you a man to meet me? Yes, replied the Yankee, at any time and where you pleaſe, only with this proviſo, that we me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> without ſeconds. Well then, to-morrow morning at five o'clock, at —. Agreed. The company preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to diſſuade the Yankee, telling him the major had every advantage where he had none, and that he had beſt compromiſe matters, ere he would have cauſe to repent his raſhneſs; but he ſtill perſiſted. The next morning the Yankee
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028656_0007_0FDA3D323856E9A0"/>repaired to the place ſomewhat before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour, armed with a <hi>large muſket,</hi> ſhortly after the major made his appearance, with his brace of piſtols and his ſword. Before he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced far, the Yankee, in an auſtere tone, bid him halt or he would blow his brains out. Upon which the major, ſtruck with amazement at this unexpected ſtratagem, reluctantly obeyed, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with him upon the injuſtice of ſuch an ungentle man like proceeding; the Yankee was implacable, determined to puniſh him for his paſt conduct and for the abuſe he had himſelf receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Lay down your ſword and piſtols, ſays he, (ſtill preſenting his muſket) and <hi>to the right, about, face, march!</hi> The poor major was again under the neceſſity of obeying, and uttering a volley of curſes againſt his ſtars, paſſively ſubmitted.—The Yankee then quietly took poſſeſſion of his arms. 'Tis baſe, 'tis cowardly thus to diſarm me of all defence, ſays the major. No, replied his fellow combatant, I will deal honorably with you, there take my muſket (throwing it towards him) and defend yourſelf. He, quite incenſed, ſeized the weapon with a mixture of exultation and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vengeance, and ruſhing forward demanded his arms <hi>or he would blow him to h—l;</hi> blow and be d—n'd, ſays the Yankee. Provoked at ſuch unparelled inſolence, in a fit of frenzy, he drew the trigger! But, alas, the muſket had <hi>not been charged!</hi> The glory of our braggadocia was ſo ſullied, and his ſeeling ſo mortally wounded by this indignation, that he ſold his commiſſion and left the place.</p>

Mr. L—, a citizen of ſome note in New-York, was taken very ill of the gout, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with ſuch dreadful apprehenſions that he looked upon himſelf as already dead. Dr. M N— was ſent for, and on entering the room his patient exclaimed. Oh, doctor, <hi>I'm a dead man, I'm a dead man!</hi> Well then, replied the doctor, I can do nothing for you, and inſtantly left the room. On his return ſome gentlemen enquired, how his patient was? How! why he is dead. Dead! ſaid they, with the utmoſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Yes, abſolutely dead, replies the doctor. The ſolemn news ſoon gained circulation; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before long it was diſcovered to be a falſe report. Some of the gentlemen to whom the doctor had communicated the intelligence meeting with him ſhortly afterwards, queſtioned him, why he had informed them that Mr L— was dead, when it was not ſo. What is he not dead? ſaid he. No ſurely. Well then, ſaid the doctor, <hi>he is ad—n'd liar for he told me ſo himſelf.</hi>

            <p>Previous to the late American revolution, when diſtinction and rank were more faſhionable than at preſent, there happened to be a ſplendid ball in the city of New-York, which Miſs T—and Miſs M—attended. Miſs T's father had been a rope-maker in the former part of his life, but having acquired an immenſe fortune at his trade, he quit buſineſs and lived in the moſt magnificent ſtyle. But the circumſtances of Miſs M—'s father, who was a ſaddler, were ſomewhat cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed, and he ſtill ſubſiſted by the uſe of his hammer and awl. Miſs T—, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an averſion againſt Miſs M—, affected a ſurprizing mortification that the auguſt perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of the aſſembly ſhould be inſulted by the preſence of a lady of ſuch mean rank and fortune; in a fit of extreme indignation ſhe came up to Miſs M— and in a whiſper ſaid to her, Miſs, I wiſh to ſpeak to you before one of the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Miſs M— conſented, and when they came before the manager, Miſs T— proclaimed in a loud voice, which inſtantly ſilenced the whole company, "Mr. Manager, I am aſtoniſhed that you admit a perſon of her low rank (pointing to Miſs M—) to diſgrace the preſence of her ſuperiors, and at any rate I think if ſuch creatures cannot be excluded, they ought to be compelled to wear the badges of their profeſſions." "Alas, retorted Miſs M—, with a ſmile of infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, were we all to appear with the <hi>badges</hi> of

            <p>Two lawyers, who were as different in ſtature as in ability, happened to be opponents in a cauſe.

            <p>A man was at another time brought before the ſame magiſtrate, when Shakeſpear was preſent, for defamation, in calling his neighbor a <hi>ſcaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> Pray, ſir, ſaid Shakeſpear to the juſtice, attend ſeriouſly to this charge, for to me it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears there is ſome very <hi>dirty work</hi> going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>A young lady of earl C—d's acquaintance, having refuſed her hand to a very deſerving man, becauſe he was poor, and being upon the point of marriage with a rich old gentleman; Madam, ſays his lordſhip, I always took you for a woman of ſenſe, but I have been miſtaken, I find you make <hi>matrimony</hi> a meer <hi>matter of money.</hi>

            <p>About half a century ago, when it was more the faſhion to drink ale at Oxford than it is at preſent, a humorous fellow of punning memory, eſtabliſhed an ale-houſe near the pound, and wrote over the door, "Ale ſold by the pound." As his ale was as good as his jokes, the Oxonians reſorted to his houſe in great numbers, and ſometimes ſtaid there beyond the college hours. This was made a matter of complaint to the vice-chancellor, who was deſired to take away his licence by one of the proctors of the univerſity. Boniface was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to attend; and when he came into the vice-chancellor's preſence, he began hawking and ſpitting about the room <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pleaſe your worſhip I came here on purpoſe to <hi>clear</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The vice-chancellor imagined that he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally weighed his ale, and ſold it in that manner; he therefore ſaid to him—they tell me that you ſell ale by the pound, is that true? No, replied the wit. How do you then? replied the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor:—Very well, I thank you, Sir, replied he, how do you do? The chancellor laughed and ſaid <hi>get away for a raſcal,</hi> I'll ſay no more to you. The fellow departed and paſſing the quadrangle, met the proctor who laid the information. Sir, ſaid he, the vice-chancellor wants to ſpeak with you, and returned with him. Here Sir, ſaid he, here he is.—Who? ſaid the chancellor. <hi>Why
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028656_0040_0FDA3D259E89B020"/>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you ſent me for a raſcal, and I've brought you the greateſt that I knew of.</hi>

            <p>An arrogant Engliſhman paſſing through New-Jerſey in the ſtage, entered into a lengthy detail in praiſe of the ſeverity of Britiſh diſcipline, and obſerved as an inſtance, that two ſoldiers in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis's army were hung merely for robbing a hen-rooſt. A facetious Jerſeyman in company, ſaid, it was a pity this diſcipline had not been enforced among Lord Howe's men when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded New-Jerſey. Why, ſo? ſays the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

               <hi>The</hi> Parſon <hi>and the</hi> Fowls; <hi>or, the</hi> Maid <hi>too cunning for her</hi> Maſter.</p>
            <p>A rich old bachelor, a clergyman in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, having made choice of a pretty young maid to be his houſe-keeper, had ordered upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sunday, a couple of fowls to be got read for his dinner, that after he had given his congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a little Chriſtian conſolation at church, he might come home and refreſh his tired vitals with a dainty modicum; when the clerk and his loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bily aſſiſtants had chimed all in, for about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, away jogged the ſhepherd to fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſheep, and meaſure his time by the hour glaſs, leaving his pretty houſekeeper to prepare
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028656_0044_0FDA3D28B1872360"/>the cacklers againſt the accoſtomed time of his return.</p>
            <p>The diligent maid, when ſhe thought her ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maſter had been long enough exalted two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees above his clerk, to get about a quarter of an hour on the right ſide of his text, gueſſed it a very proper time to lay down the fowls, which ſhe did accordingly. As the tidbits were running merrily round before a rouſing fire, who ſhould take the advantage of the parſon's abſence, but his houſekeeper's ſweetheart, who by his pleaſant, comical hoity-toities, and other winning accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, had ſo wriggled himſelf into her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that it is not unreaſonable to think he had as much command as her maſter.</p>
            <p>The maid having miſtaken the time of the day, happened to be a little too early with her cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo that the fowls were full ready before the parſon had given his hungry auditory leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to their puddings and dumplings. The ſweetheart being a fellow of an incomparable ſtomach, thought it a great pity, ſuch good victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ſhould be ſpoiled for want of eating, and very eagerly ſolicited his loving Jug to ſpare him one of the fowls to ſtop a little hole he had in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, telling her one would be ſufficient for her maſter, and that ſhe had wit enough to contrive ſome ſtory or other, handſomely to excuſe the matter, and blind him from the true knowledge of what became of it.</p>
            <p>The maid being willing to oblige her lover, who ſhe found was ſo deſirous to oblige her upon all occaſions, ventured to take up one to ſave the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028656_0045_0FDA3D5E7B5E2A78"/>longing of her ſweetheart who being very well prepared for ſuch a nice entertainment, gobbled it up with ſuch expedition, that before his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſs had wound up the jack, he had not ſo much as left the claws which the poor cockral u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſcratch the dunghill withal.</p>
            <p>He had no ſooner diſpatched his ſweetheart's firſt courteſy, but he began to be very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with her for the ſecond, telling her an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe was as eaſy made for both as for one, and that ſhe had as good be hanged for a ſheep as a lamb; till at laſt, by adding a few melting kiſſes to his ravenous ſolicitations, he prevailed upon her to draw the other off the ſpit, that he might finiſh his meal by robbing the parſon of his Sunday's dinner.</p>
            <p>The ſecond bird being brought before him, he loſt no time, but drove down the former with the latter, without any viſible abatement of either his ſpeed or of his appetite. When he had cleared the diſh, and waſhed all down with a cup of the parſon's beſt beer, he took a thankful leave of his miſtreſs, who now began to be at her wit's end how to excuſe the rudeneſs ſhe had ſo fooliſhly committed.</p>
            <p>As ſhe was thus pondering with herſelf, who ſhould ſtep in but the parſon and a ſtranger with him, who coming from another town to hear him preach, the parſon thought himſelf obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him home to dinner with him.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had the old Levite conducted his gueſts into the parlour, but he begged his pardon a minute and retired into another room to whet his knife upon the frame of an old table, which
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028656_0046_0FDA3D29D54FA870"/>was always his cuſtom before dinner; the maid in a peck of fears and troubles took the advantage in the interim, and ſtepping into the parlour, in a ſtrange ſeeming ſort of diſorder, frightens away her maſter's gueſt with a ſurpriſing ſtory, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, viz. Lord, ſir, how came you to venture yourſelf home with my maſter, at this time of day, when if you had known him, you might have eaſily diſcovered by his countenance, he is in one of his old freaks.—Why, what's the matter with him, ſays the country farmer, he was woundy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to me in the church-yard, and by all means would bring me home to dine with him. Alas, good ſir, replied the maid, whatever you do, let me adviſe you to make the beſt of your way out of the houſe, for if you ſtay, now he is in one of his frenzical humours, he will certainly g— you; and I dare ſay, he is whetting his knife for that purpoſe; he has lately ſerved two or three ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, though they have had the diſcretion to keep it ſilent, becauſe they ſhould not be laughed at. I thank thee kindly ſweetheart, cry'd the countryman, are theſe his tricks—wounds, ſhew me the neareſt way out. Upon which the wench ſhewed him out of a back door, and away ran Gaffer as if the devil was at his heels.</p>
            <p>He had not been gone a minute, but in comes the parſon with his knife in his hand, and finds the maid ſtamping and ſtorming, as if ſhe was ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mad in the parlour, with an empty ſineared diſh upon the table, and his gueſt gone. What's the matter now, ſays the parſon, what's the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all this, where is the man gone that I

            <p>The Emperor Charles V. having wandered up and down for a good while in a foreſt, where he had loſt his way in hunting, found himſelf at laſt

            <p>A country juſtice invited Edwin one day to dinner, with many other perſons; and having a mind to ſhew his wit, took theſe aſide and told them, "Gentlemen, if you'll be ruled by me, we ſhall make ourſelves merry to day with Edwin, who you know ſets up for a jeſter, and drolls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every body. My clerk being ſick a bed, ſo that I have no body to wait on us, I will propoſe to draw cuts, to ſee which of us ſhall go to the cellar to draw the wine, and wait on the reſt whilſt they are at dinner: and I will contrive it ſo, that it ſhall fall to Edwin's lot." Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus concluded amongſt them, was put into execution accordingly. Edwin ſmoaked the plot, and was reſolved to make his hoſt repent it. Down he went to the cellar to fill the bottles, whilſt the others fell too; and being come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with the bottles, "You ſee, Gentlemen, ſaid he, how I have performed what I had to do; let us now draw cuts <hi>to ſee which of us ſhall go down into the cellar to ſtop the hogſheads I have left run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>" Now the juſtice talked no more of caſting lots, and knowing Edwin to be as good as his word, leaves preſently his dinner, and runs to the cellar, where he finds his veſſels running, and part of his wine ſpilt, for which he afterwards expoſtulated with Edwin.

            <p>The following ſtory is related of the king of Pruſſia. A clergyman of Neufchatel chapel preached againſt eternal d—n. His pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioners were ſo diſguſted with him, that they would not afterwards ſuffer him to enter the church-door, nay, they even pelted him. The king hearing of it, ordered the doors to be thrown open to the prieſt, that he might reſume his func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The parſon now reſumed his ſubject. He would not allow eternal d—n by any means; he had no objection to a limited time, even a hundred thouſand years, but not infinite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The pariſhioners would not ſuffer him to go on with his ſermon, but pulled him headlong from his roſtrum, turned him out of the church, and again pelted him. The king ſent for the prieſt, and cenſured him for his abſurdity in reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a ſubject ſo noxious to his bearers, and ſaid, "Since my ſubjects of Neufch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

"Pretty well, I thank your lordſhip, I hope you are well," replied the ruſtic, with ſuch a ſimplicity in his manner, that threw the court into a fit of laughter that laſted for a quarter of an hour. His lordſhip was as merry as the reſt, and leaned to his caſe in ſuch a manner that he was acquitted.</p>

"No, Sir, replied Tom, as you are going to ride, I thought they would ſoon be dirty again;" "Very well, ſaid the Dean, go and get the horſes ready." In the mean time the Dean ordered the landlord to let his man have no breakfaſt. When the ſervant returned, the Dean aſked if the horſes were ready? "Yes, Sir," ſays the ſervant; "Go bring them out then," ſaid the Dean; "I have not had my breakfaſt yet, Sir," ſays Tom; <hi>"Oh, no matter for that, ſays the Dean, if you had it you would ſoon be hungry again."</hi> They mounted and rode off; as they rode the Dean pulled a book out of his pocket and began to read, a gentleman met them and ſeeing the doctor reading, was not willing to

            <p>Dr. Thompſon was a peculiar ſloven, and in the practice of a phyſician, an utter and declared enemy to muffins, which he always forbad his patients.

            <p>Pope, who, whatever his other good qualities might be, certainly was not much troubled with good nature; was one evening at Button's coffee-houſe, where he and a ſet of literati had got po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring over a manuſcript of the Greek comic poet Ariſtophanes, in which they found a paſſage that none of them could comprehend: as they talked pretty loud, a young officer who ſtood by the fire, heard their conference, and begged that he might be permitted to look at the paſſage.

            <p>Rocheſter, in king Charles the Second's time, was as famous for his frolic and humor, as he was infamous for his vices; one day as he was walking in the park, with ſome of his gay companions, he ſaw Dr. Barrow, one of the greateſt divines, and the greateſt mathematician of his time, muſing along the Mall, in his uſual contemplative man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and ſo he propoſed to make up to him, and have ſome drollery, as he termed it.

The doctor, who was not eaſy to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, perceived his drift, and with all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure in the world, returned the lowly bow, and ſaid, "My lord, I am your's to the Antipodes."

            <p>A number of Iriſh gentlemen coming on a party of pleaſure to London, a few weeks ſince, were becalmed midway between the harbor of Dublin and Parkgate. After ſurveying for ſome
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028656_0090_0FDA3DD057AD3FB0"/>time the watery expanſe, they had recourſe to that which is the general refuge in the moments of ſuſpence or difficulty, and a potent bowl of punch was ordered in the cabin. To that they were no ſooner ſeated, than, ſtill warm with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent patriotiſm, they characteriſtically drank, "The land we live in, and proſperity to it."</p>
            <p>Lord Mansfield, being in one of the counties, on the circuit, a poor woman was indicted for witchcraft. The inhabitants of the place were exaſperated againſt her. Some witneſſes depoſed, that they had ſeen her walk in the air, with her feet upwards and her head downwards. Lord Mansfield heard the evidence with great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and perceiving the temper of the people, whom it would not have been prudent to irritate, he thus addreſſed them: "I do not doubt that this woman has walked in the air, with her feet upwards, ſince you have all ſeen it; but ſhe has the honor to be born in England as well as you and I, and conſequently, cannot be judged but by the laws of the country, nor puniſhed but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as ſhe has violated them. Now I know not one law that forbids walking in the air with the feet upwards. We have all a right to do it with impunity. I ſee no reaſon, therefore, for proſecution; and this poor woman may return home when ſhe pleaſes."—I his ſpeech had its proper effect: it pleaſed the auditory, and the woman retired from court without moleſtation.</p>

Accordingly, one of them, who had an impediment in his ſpeech, came up to the captain, and made his bow. "What is your objection?" ſaid the captain. "I ca a-an't go, anſwers the man, becauſe I ſt-ſt-ſtutter." "Statter! ſays the captain; you don't go there to talk but to fight." "Aye, but they'll p-p-put me upon g-g-guard, and a man may go ha-ha-half a mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can ſay, Wh-wh-who goes there?"—"Oh, that is no objection, for they will place ſome other ſentry with you, and he can challenge, if you can fire."

"I was bleſſed this year, ſaid he, with ſuch a miraculous and luxuriant crop of Indian corn, that in plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it I was obliged to have a candle carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me at noon day, in order to light me along the furrows, for ſuch was the darkneſs occaſioned by the monſtrous leaves of corn. When huſking time came on, the corn had grown to ſuch an amazing height, that I was under the neceſſity of having ladders erected againſt the ſtalks before I could have it gathered." "By St. Chriſtopher, replied one of the tars, who was not inclined to be out done, that is not half ſo great a wonder as we have ſeen, for before our late arrival on the American coaſt, we were overtaken by ſuch a hard gale of wind, that it took ten men to hold one man's hair upon his head."</p>

When this was done the gentleman aroſe and viewing himſelf in the glaſs, exclaimed, Why—why you d—n'd raſ—raſcal you have but half ſhaved me. No, ſir, replied the barber, I thought there was no occaſion to do more, for you was <hi>half ſhaved</hi> when you came.</p>
            <p>One ſailor coming to ſee another one pay-day, deſired to borrow twenty ſhillings of him: The monied man fell to telling out the ſum in ſhillings, but a half-crown thruſting its head in, put him out, and he began to tell again: but then an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent crown-piece was as officious as his half-brother had been, and again interrupted the tale; ſo that taking up a handful of ſilver, he cried, "Here Jack, give me a handful when your ſhip's paid; <hi>what a pox ſignifies counting it?</hi>"</p>
