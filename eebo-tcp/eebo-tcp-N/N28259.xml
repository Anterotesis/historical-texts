            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>DAVID, by divine direction, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the nobles and judges of the earth, denominates them <hi>gods</hi>—"I ſaid, Ye are gods, and all of you children of the Moſt High." Though he thus dignifies them with the appellation of "gods, and children of the Moſt High," yet to them he adds the ſolemn and humiliating declaration—"Ye ſhall die like men." Though "it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to all men," princes and judges, as well as their ſubjects, "once to die," yet it is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the death of men, ſuſtaining different characters, ſhould be noticed with different emotions and tokens of reſpect. Though our feelings often forbid us to ſpeak evil of the dead, yet we always perceive that ſociety ſuſtains a greater loſs in the death of a virtuous, deſirable and uſeful man, than in the death of one who
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037663_0004_100F35571227C420"/>
was pernicious and forbidding. If we aſcend to the great perſonages who fill the moſt important offices, and whoſe conduct has great influence on the public mind, our feelings will know a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the death of a Moſes, a Joſhua or a Samuel, and the death of an Ahab, an Hazael or a Jeroboam. Thoſe remarks ſuppoſe we wiſely eſtimate the character and worth of men.</p>
            <p>The death of that public character, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence has been employed in the promotion of public happineſs, will be lamented; while the death of him, whoſe influence has been peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and deſtructive of public tranquillity, will not excite grateful teſtimonials of reſpect and ſorrow. Theſe remarks, it is conceived, find ſupport as we turn the pages of inſpiration.</p>
            <p>Solomon ſays, "The memory of the juſt is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but the name of the wicked ſhall rot." Reſpecting Jehoiakim, king of Judah, of whom it is ſaid "his heart was but for covetouſneſs, and to ſhed innocent blood, and for oppreſſion, and for violence—thus ſaith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim—The people ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah! my brother—they ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah! Lord, or ah! his glory; but he ſhall be buried with the burial of an aſs, drawn and caſt forth beyond the gates of the city." Becauſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037663_0005_100F3558A1ABE750"/>
of his wickedneſs, his death ſhall not be noticed with tokens of reſpect and lamentation; as ſaid of the wicked, "his name ſhall rot." But "the memory of the juſt is bleſſed—the righteous ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance." If, therefore, the memory of the juſt and great is bleſſed—if all Iſrael lamented the death of Samuel, and others, becauſe of their ſingular integrity, and extenſive uſefulneſs to their tribes—then ſhall not all our intereſted countrymen deeply lament the recent and ſudden deceaſe of the venerable and beloved man, who was the "chariot of" our American "Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof?" Shall not we, my breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, as a part of this great community, mingle our tears with our bereaved fellow citizens, and join our hearts to the general voice—"Ah! Lord, and ah! his glory?" The death of one ſo eminently uſeful deſerves to be noticed with national lamentation.</p>
            <p>The important ſervices he has rendered his country, are a good reaſon why "his name ſhould be bleſſed, and held in everlaſting remembrance."</p>
            <p>On this occaſion I have choſen, for the guide of our meditation, the paſſage which informs us of the death of Samuel, and the lamentation which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited through all the tribes of Iſrael. "Samuel died, and all the Iſraelites were gathered together, and lamented him."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037663_0006_100F355B01C46098"/>
In purſuing this ſubject, I ſhall attempt to ſhow why it was proper for all Iſrael to lament the death of Samuel; and, as we proceed, I ſhall apply theſe reaſons for lamentation to ourſelves, and to the people of the United States, who are now, by the holy providence of God, bereaved of the ILLUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRIOUS CHIEF of our armies.</p>
            <p>The firſt reaſon we aſſign for this general mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Samuel is, on account of the purity of his morals, and the unblamable propriety of his conduct on all occaſions. He was not only amiable in his moral character, and highly reſpectable on this account, but his memory was eſpecially dear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the happy influence of his virtuous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the general manners of ſociety. Being th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> an inſtrument of public good by his commendable example, his life was precious—his death calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and hence to be lamented by a grateful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Theſe reaſons for lamenting the death of Samuel apply to the caſe now in view. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the great character whoſe death is announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, deſerves to be dear to us on account of the amiableneſs of his morals, and the unvarying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of his conduct in all the important ſtations in which he has been called to act. <hi>Who</hi> has ever dared to reproach him as a man of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted morals, or indecent demeanour? <hi>Who,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:037663_0007_100F355D65CA4160"/>
that has been honoured as a companion in his moſt <hi>ſocial hours,</hi> that could ever charge him with rude hilarity, with ruſtic and boiſterous mirth, and with immoral and degrading converſation? The univerſal teſtimony of his moſt intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſupports the moſt refined gracefulneſs of his manners, and the ſingular dignity of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, even in the <hi>ſocial circle,</hi> and when leaſt under the <hi>criticiſm</hi> of the public eye.</p>
            <p>Though he was long familiarized to the field of war, and a daily witneſs of the too faſhionable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his martial brethren, yet he never degraded himſelf by an imitation of their follies. His uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form example was a conſtant leſſon of ſolemn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. The common vices of the camp, ſuch as intemperance and profanity, were known to be ſo extremely ungrateful to his moral taſte, that thoſe moſt eaſily beſet with theſe ſins felt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence as a moſt powerful reſtraint. We have not only the pleaſure to ſpeak thus explicitly in favour of the purity and dignity of the moral character of the Man whom all the people delighted to honour, but we have farther reaſon to rejoice, in the belief that he ever acted upon moral principle.</p>
            <p>When Commander of our armies, and when Preſident of our nation, he often publicly declared his full belief in the univerſal and righteous provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037663_0008_100F356044ABFFC8"/>
of God. This his belief was ever expreſſed in terms indicative of an humble ſenſe of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. His acknowledgments of favours were alſo expreſſive of the temper of a grateful heart.</p>
            <p>The benign influence of religion on the order and happineſs of ſociety, was a ſubject which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his devout contemplation, and on which he hath expreſſed himſelf in the moſt pleaſing terms. In his Farewell Addreſs, which we now read with ſolemn thoughtfulneſs, he obſerves, that "<hi>religion</hi> and <hi>morality</hi> are indiſpenſable ſupports to political proſperity—that <hi>theſe</hi> are the great pillars of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineſs—that they have an intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with private and public felicity—and that if a ſenſe of religious obligation deſert the oaths which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in courts of juſtice, there can be no ſecurity left for proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, reputation and life." Theſe ſentiments har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize with divine truth—that "godlineſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to all things;" and ſhow, that a deep ſenſe of its worth had a fixed reſidence in his heart. For theſe reaſons, his death calls for our ſincere lamentation. "His memory is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed," and his name deſerves to be held in our "laſting remembrance." The advantages deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſociety, from his moral inſtructions and example, are innumerable, and ineſtimably great.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037663_0009_100F3561D14FEE38"/>
This remark will appear juſt, if we recur to the pernicious influence on ſociety of a bad example in men who have filled eminent ſtations; of which the world has witneſſed many inſtances, and had fatal experience.</p>
            <p>Look through the hiſtory of the Jews, and when did a vile and immoral character preſide over the nation, and the ill effects of his example were not felt through all their tribes?</p>
            <p>Immoral kings were a mean of leading many of their ſubjects to idolatry and vice. It is ſaid of Jeroboam, that he not only ſinned himſelf, but "he made Iſrael to ſin." We might name many other kings, of Judah and Iſrael, whoſe evil example was deſtructive of the morals of ſociety; and alſo many inſtances of the kind in more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times. The common diſcernment of the world has remarked, that a vicious prince will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vice faſhionable in his court; and a vicious court will diſſeminate vice through the various parts of the ſtate or nation. That the national court impart ſomething of their own caſt of mind, and give currency to certain modes of conduct, amongſt the people, may appear from the two following inſtances:—When Oliver Cromwell aſſumed the government of England, and had the addreſs to create a court after his own image, a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037663_0010_100F356421954270"/>
great part of the people appeared to partake of his fervent ſpirit, and of his impetuous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable temper. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Charles the Second, who ſoon ſucceeded Cromwell, was reſtored to the throne, he ſoon made it evident that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to riotous pleaſures, and to degrading indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. His indecent and vicious morals had a ruinous influence on the court, which ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the very nurſery of vice. The theatres alſo, which were eſtabliſhed for the cultivation of good morals, and for the excitement of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable emulation and refinement, were proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to the exhibition of ſcenes of impurity. Thus a vicious king corrupted the morals both of the court and the ſtage, from which ſources immorality had an alarming prevalence through the nation. His reign gave countenance to men of deiſtical ſentiments, ſome of whom were eminent for their abilities, and came forth with all poſſible freedom in ſupport of their cauſe, being encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in their attacks on divine revelation, by the demoralizing opinions and practices of their prince and his favourites at court.</p>
            <p>Again: That irreligious rulers give currency to vice among their ſubjects, has received recent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. We have lived to paſs the degenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed period, when the legiſlature of the <hi>great and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

republic</hi> gave their cheerful aſſent to ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſentiments as theſe—"That death is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſleep—that reaſon dethrones both the kings of the earth, and the kings of heaven—that man, when free, wants no other divinity than himſelf—and that every republic, but a republic of atheiſts, is a chimera." Under the influence of ſuch opinions, they have proſcribed the holy Sabbath, and all the inſtitutions of the goſpel. The natural effects of this licentiouſneſs of the national court have been already realized. All the vile paſſions which agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the human mind have received encouragements Vice, in all its moſt extravagant forms, has tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over ſocial order and religion. "<hi>The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed walk on every ſide taken the vileſt men are exalted."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In connexion with the above obſervations, as to the pernicious influence of immorality in princes, and men of eminence in ſociety, we remark, that had our illuſtrious and <hi>departed</hi> PATRIOT, when Commander of our armies, or Preſident of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional court, exhibited an example of vicious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſregard to the inſtitutions of religion—had be been devoted to pleaſure; and a ſupporter of diſſipation, ſhe unhappy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

imitation, the advantages hence reſulting have been ineſtimably great. In this view of his character, his death we lament; "his memory is bleſſed," and his name will live in the grateful and laſting remembrance of his countrymen.</p>
            <p>In this connexion we may ſee our obligations to unite in thankful praiſe to Him <hi>by whom princes and judges rule,</hi>" in that he hath again raiſed to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency of our nation one who is explicitly attached to the religion of the goſpel, and whoſe virtuous example is alſo a pointed condemnation of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and vice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Samuel lived in the time of a great revolution in Iſrael—while an important change took place in their government. In their revolution Samuel was an eminent character. His wiſdom and integrity ſhone conſpicuouſly. He was held in high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by the people, as one faithful to the truſt repoſed in him, and as an unſhaken friend to their true intereſt and happineſs. Though, in the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency and extravagance of party ſpirit, ſome dared to oppoſe the meaſures which he recommended—though ſome ſpake evil of his dignity, and inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was a man of corrupt deſigns—yet, when he was dead, they became convinced that he was wiſe in counſel, and that his intentions were good. All the people remembered his advice, his virtues
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037663_0013_100F356B1FFBBE80"/>
and his uſefulneſs, and hence lamented him as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Iſrael, and a friend thereof.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>deceaſed</hi> PATRIOT and friend lived, like Samuel, in a time of great revolution. He has been looked to, in a time of univerſal alarm, danger and anxiety, as a moſt conſpicuous and uſeful man; and his important ſervices have exceeded in value the ſupporting anticipations of his warmeſt friends. Were we to attempt a particular delineation of his virtues, and a repreſentation of his uſefulneſs, in the time of <hi>our</hi> revolution, the ſubject would beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar all deſcription. Our greateſt efforts muſt cloſe in the language of the queen of Sheba when ſhe came to ſurvey the glory of Solomon—"The one half of the greatneſs of thy wiſdom is not told, for thou exceedeſt the fame that I have heard of thee." Let us therefore come down to humble expreſſions, and content ourſelves with ſaying, that his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent uſefulneſs is acknowledged by all claſſes of our citizens, and that nothing can be added in his praiſe, which could excite an higher ſenſe of his worth than is now engraven on the hearts of his countrymen. If all Iſrael had reaſon to lament the death of Samuel, all our united tribes are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to mourn the departure of our beloved CHIEF, in the grateful remembrance of his ſervices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:037663_0014_100F356CC14D09D0"/>
If ſome, in the time of public tumult, party ſpirit and prejudice in Iſrael, dared to reproach the conduct of Samuel, whoſe whole life was as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable as that of any man with whom the world has been honoured; then, though ſome have preſumed to blame the adminiſtration of him for whom we now mourn, we are not to conſider this as a ſingular inſtance of vile paſſion in man, nor as evidence againſt the venerable accuſed, that he was defective as to wiſdom, or depraved in his deſigns. Thoſe who have wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented his intentions as vile and pernicious, will probably learn their error and guilt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret; and perhaps ſome will come to this ſenſe when it is too late, there being no more ſpace for repentance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Under the direction of Samuel, the Iſraelites had great ſucceſs againſt their enemies. It is ſaid, "The hand of the Lord was againſt the enemies of Iſrael all the days of Samuel." He was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant of the public. His wiſdom and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were a mean of the preſervation of his country, when threatened with ruin by invading foes. He was an eminent inſtrument, in the hand of Providence, of their ſucceſs againſt thoſe who violated their rights. The people had a grateful remembrance of his invaluable ſervices, and hence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037663_0015_100F356E66389778"/>
indulged undiſſembled lamentation at his death.</p>
            <p>The world has been aſtoniſhed at the ſucceſs of the American arms, under the wiſe arrangements of our highly-favoured Commander, who is now no more. His faithfulneſs in the cauſe of his country is confeſſed by all who have come to the knowledge of his hiſtory. We honour him, as having been a conſpicuous inſtrument, in the hand of kind Providence, of our ſalvation, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive enemies ſought our ruin. He has not borne the ſword in vain, but with great and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs, againſt foreign enemies, the enemies of the wilderneſs, and the ſtill more unreaſonable enemies of our happineſs who have ariſen among ourſelves. His ineſtimable labours have endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and will perpetuate his name.</p>
            <p>The evident benevolence which excited him to ſubmit to the toils of war, and to burden himſelf with the high reſponſibility attached to his civil adminiſtrations, ſhow him to have been an enemy to vile oppreſſion, and an immutable friend to the intereſt and happineſs of his country. As Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel's whole life rendered it evident that he was not ſeeking to enrich himſelf with the property of his people, no leſs noble has been the conduct of our <hi>renowned Philanthropiſt,</hi> whoſe ſervices are now ended. That to increaſe his property was not his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037663_0016_100F35716B386460"/>
object, in all the cares, toils, dangers and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in which he engaged, and which he ſupported with wiſdom, fortitude and perſeverance, for the good of his country, it is evident, in that he would accept no compenſation. It is true, he was able to ſupport himſelf upon his own property; but is it common that men are willing to labour for nothing becauſe they are affluent? Do we often find it the caſe that men of fortune are unwilling to add to their ſtock, by receiving a full reward for their ſervices? Let captious prejudice ſay what it will, we are bound, by the laws of charity, to call this refuſal of compenſation benevolence. It looks like "love which ſeeketh not her own," and is to be conſidered in this light. This refuſal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is ſtill one of the leaſt of the evidences of his diſintereſted love to his country. He made a much greater ſacrifice than this, in relinquiſhing the charms of retirement, and in ſubjecting himſelf to the toils and hazards of the public offices to which he has been called. If, therefore, we are capable of gratitude, we ſhall exerciſe it in a view of theſe benevolent ſervices. If we love that which is great and good, we ſhall admire this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of ſoul. If worth of character can excite our eſteem, and the death of ſuch, our grief, we ſhall weep on the tomb of our GREAT and HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOURABLE FRIEND.</p>

4. Samuel was a great Civilian, and was known as a judge in Iſrael, throughout all their tribes. "He went in circuit from year to year to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Iſrael in all thoſe places." He was acknowledged as wiſe and impartial, and was highly reſpected by the people. It is ſaid, "All the people greatly feared him." Being ſo generally known, ſo eminently juſt and uſeful, and ſo highly reſpected, his death came near to every heart—it was afflictive, and excited general lamentation. The people recognized him as a righteous judge and father in Iſrael, and they lamented his deceaſe, as for a father dead.</p>
            <p>Our great Civilian, and our Leader in arms, who now ſleeps in death, was known through all our tribes. All claſſes of men ſeemed to be acquainted with him, and ſuffered no other to rival him in their affections. His wiſdom and his integrity were indiſputable, both in the cabinet and in the field of war. His uſefulneſs was eminent, both as a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to our country, and a defender of our rights. We felt intereſted in his honour and happineſs—we were profited by his ſervices—we delighted in ſhowing him reſpect, and we had no fear of excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing envy in any who were leſs noticed. Hence, how can it be otherwiſe than that his death ſhould ſolemnly affect us? How natural is it to lament
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037663_0018_100F3575DD01B090"/>
over him in the language of the king of Iſrael over the departing prophet—"O my father! my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!"</p>
            <p n="5">5. There followed the revolution in Iſrael, or the change of their government, a great and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening diviſion amongſt the people. Their political ideas were extremely confuſed, and their paſſions were all in arms. The people were divided into two great and powerful parties: Saul was at the head of one, and David was the leader of the other. Samuel, in this ſeaſon of alarm and diſtreſs, gave an example of moderation, wiſdom, and fortitude, which deſerves the admiration of the world. He reproved the malevolence, the envy and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary intentions of thoſe who deſerved ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, with all the ſolemnity and faithfulneſs of an angel from heaven. He put himſelf forward, as a terror to evil doers, with all the majeſty of an arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hoſt. <hi>Who,</hi> therefore, can ſufficiently admire the wiſdom of his counſels, and form a juſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the worth of his ſervices? It is fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he was the mean, in the hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of ſaving the tribes of Iſrael from incalcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable loſs of blood and treaſure. Like an angel of peace, his wiſdom and mediation ſaved them from diſtreſſes and woes indeſcribable. How deep and real, therefore, muſt have been the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at his death!</p>

Theſe remarks on Samuel apply with equal truth to "America's Favourite Son," whoſe memory will ever be dear to us all. He has lived to ſee envy, party ſpirit and prejudice riſe up amongſt ourſelves, after a very important revolution in our favour. He has ſeen the paſſion and unſubmiſſive ſpirit of party ariſe with weapons of war to oppoſe the adminiſtration of government. He has ſeen the order and tranquillity of the nation moſt alarmingly threatened, by thoſe who have loved ſtrangers rather than thoſe of their own houſe. His wiſdom, ſtability, and perſeverance in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional righteouſneſs, in theſe ſeaſons of tumult and danger, have been bleſſed: they have been a mean of reſtoring order where confuſion began to ſpread its miſeries. He hath diſplayed himſelf as became one whom kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had raiſed up to be a miniſter of God for good to the people, and to bear the ſword of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and order not in vain—to rebuke the madneſs of diſobedience, and to protect the friends of order and civil happineſs. In the ſenſe in which Samuel was a Saviour of Iſrael, our PATRIOT and GUAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIAN, who has now ceaſed from his labours, was the Saviour of his country. As Samuel's wiſdom, counſels and virtue were a mean of preſerving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Iſrael from total confuſion, and univerſal
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037663_0020_100F357A599F2C70"/>
wretchedneſs, ſo <hi>his</hi> diſcernment and efforts have probably been a mean, in the hand of Providence, of our preſervation from ſeditions, tumults and blood. His name ſhall live in the hearts of his countrymen. He ſhall be held in remembrance of thoſe yet to be born. Fathers ſhall ſpeak of his important ſervices, with gratitude and admiration, "to their ſons and to their ſons' ſons." His me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is and will be "bleſſed."</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Iſraelites lamented for Samuel, becauſe they felt their need of his future counſels and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The civil commotions in Iſrael continued at the time of his death. Saul and David each had their parties and adherents. It was a day of great darkneſs and terror. They were threatened by their powerful enemies, the Philiſtines. This with the riotous and party ſpirit of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, excited great alarm and anxiety. Not only their enemies from abroad, but the violence of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among themſelves, threatened the ruin of the ſtate. Saul continued to purſue David, with envy, malevolence and murder in his heart. David and his men were hunted in the woods of Paleſtine—they were oppreſſed, and chaſed in their minds—they were valiant in battle—there was reaſon why the people ſhould tremble in fear of the fatal iſſue of theſe circumſtances. The people felt
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037663_0021_100F357D23A47B30"/>
their need of the wiſdom, experience, fortitude and prudence of Samuel, to moderate, direct and tranquilize the public mind, which had now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reſtleſs and paſſionate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We</hi> feel <hi>our</hi> need of the continued ſervices of our <hi>wiſe and experienced Leader</hi> in counſel and arms, who is now ſilent in death, having finiſhed his courſe. His prayer was, "that man might no longer be the enemy of man;" but this his benevolent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is not yet anſwered. The world is in trouble—a martial ſpirit has pervaded the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—thoſe with which we have intercourſe are paraded in arms. We have enemies abroad—we have the diſcontented and mutinous at home—the ſtorm gathers around us, and threatens to burſt its thunders on our heads.</p>
            <p>We are in danger of being drawn into the vortex of war, and its miſeries. While we pray that the God of armies, and the God of mercy, would ſave us from theſe woes, we have to lament the loſs of one who has been honoured as an inſtrument of our country's ſalvation, in perilous times; whoſe aid and experience we ſtill need; whoſe wiſdom and valour had acquired univerſal confidence, and whoſe very name inſpired the ſons of America with fortitude and hope.</p>

7. The Iſraelites mourned for Samuel in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his warnings and exhortations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt political jealouſies, and ſedition. In a time of diſaffection toward their government, and when many were indulging complaint, Samuel received direction from the Lord to "proteſt ſolemnly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, and to ſhow them the manner of the king," or the unhappineſs of that government, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they ſought to place themſelves.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he people refuſed to obey the voice of Samuel" in this reſpect; though he was faithful in his admonitions, and ſhowed himſelf a friend to their beſt intereſts. Our <hi>celebrated Civilian,</hi> deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, has ſolemnly admoniſhed his fellow citizens againſt ſeditious principles, and a riotous oppoſition to the eſtabliſhed government. The following ſentiments are his: "The very idea of the power and the right of the people to eſtabliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, preſuppoſes the duty of every individual to obey the eſtabliſhed government. All obſtructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and aſſociations, under whatever plauſible character, with the real deſign to direct, controul, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the conſtituted authorities, are deſtructive of this fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle, and of fatal tendency." This admonition is fitted to ſuppreſs licentious politics,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037663_0023_100F358233C66CD0"/>
and to direct public opinion in the way of ſobriety, order, and civil happineſs. And ſuch is the ſtate of man, that popular opinion is in conſtant need of ſuch direction, becauſe its frailties greatly expoſe it to a wrong bias; and, when this is the caſe, it can eaſily ſubvert the beſt mode of government, and trample on thoſe laws which promiſe ſafety to the public. Under ſuch warnings of our enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Inſtructor, who, "though dead, yet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth," let us watch againſt a ſeditious ſpirit, and thoſe irritating jealouſies which ſap the foundation of public tranquillity, and which tend to involve in irreparable diſorders and ſufferings.</p>
            <p n="8">8. All the Iſraelites lamented the death of Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. Let us put emphaſis on the word <hi>all,</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reaſon why <hi>all</hi> Iſrael were afflicted by this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Samuel was a public benefactor: he had wrought in the ſervice of his country, and ſpent his life for its good. <hi>All</hi> had derived advantages from his wiſdom, and from his faithfulneſs to their intereſts and happineſs. Univerſal teſtimonials of reſpect and mourning at his death were a tribute due to his memory, and ſuitably expreſſive of the public ſenſe of his worth. We are called to mourn, with all our brethren of the United States, the deceaſe of <hi>our moſt worthy and honourable Friend,</hi> as for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic benefactor. From his youth he devoted
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037663_0024_100F358502CFBA00"/>
himſelf to the ſervice of his country, and has ſpent an invaluable life in the promotion of public hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. He has ſuſtained the moſt arduous offices, and filled them with ſingular dignity, not with an ultimate view to acquire the applauſe of men, but to procure laſting advantages for his people. His benevolent purpoſes have met with ſurpriſing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. We have all derived benefits from his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his labours and ſufferings. His life was a bleſſing to every <hi>individual</hi> in United America, and we <hi>all</hi> owe him a weighty and pleaſing debt of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. His unremitting exertions at the head of our armies, and in the chair of ſtate, have been a diſtinguiſhed mean of the eſtabliſhment and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our rights and liberties, civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, which we hold as valuable beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p>The arms of death have now embraced this <hi>our great and honourable Friend</hi>—who has ſubmitted to numberleſs perils and toils for our good—who has traverſed the bloody camp to protect us, and give us liberty—who has left the ſweets of retirement, and placed himſelf at the helm of government, to ſave us from wreck and torture—who has ſhowed himſelf the friend of God, the friend of man, the friend of his country, the ſupporter of that religion which is neceſſary to our preſent and ultimate hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037663_0025_100F3586907C0050"/>
—and who has exhibited a public example of all thoſe virtues which dignify the character of man, and render ſocial intercourſe deſirable. Let our nation therefore be clad in ſackcloth, for "the mighty man is fallen"—the beauty and delight of our Iſrael is no more. "Ye daughters" of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, "weep over him who hath clothed you with ſcarlet, and with other delights, and who hath put ornaments of gold on your apparel."</p>
            <p n="9">9. Public mourning for Samuel, and mourning on ſuch an occaſion as now invites our grief, is ſuitable, becauſe it is but a juſt acknowledgment of the virtues and worth of thoſe whoſe death is thus lamented. It is an evidence of public grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for what they have done for the good of their country, and for the benefit of the world. Beſide, public teſtimonials of reſpect for the memory of thoſe deceaſed, who have been eminently virtuous and uſeful, has a favourable influence on the living. It operates as an encouragement to the living to imitate the example of the honourable dead. A man firſt in the command of an army, or one high in the ſeats of civil adminiſtration, muſt feel a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and diſcouragement, on finding the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the virtuous and faithful in office rewarded with public ungratefulneſs and complaint. The cares, toils and reſponſibility of ſuch offices, when
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037663_0026_100F3588219D1270"/>
filled with wiſdom and dignity, ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the candour, affection and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the public mind. When it is made evident that public gratitude is excited toward thoſe who have ſerved their country with wiſdom and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the moſt important offices—when the labours and anxieties of ſuch offices are rewarded with the affections and confidence of the people, who ariſe at their deceaſe, and pronounce their memory bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed—then encouragement and ſupport are given, both to the warrior and civilian, amidſt all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and wearineſs of office.</p>
            <p>Hence let the affectionate reſpect which appears through our country, for the memory of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <hi>Guardian</hi> and <hi>Friend,</hi> be conſidered as proper and important, not only as it is a tribute due to his worth, but on account of its favourable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the living. Let thoſe who now, or may hereafter, fill the important offices which he hath borne, be encouraged to ſeek for the wiſdom which directed him, and to imitate all his virtues. And may they and all the people pray, in imitation of the prophet Eliſha, that a double portion of WASHINGTON's ſpirit may reſt on his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in office. While we remember his moſt important ſervices, and retain an high affection for his name—while we look up to his worth as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037663_0027_100F358B08BEB178"/>
our eſtimation, and indulge in impreſſive accents of ſorrow at his death—it becomes us to acknowledge the righteouſneſs of that providence which has laid him in his tomb. "Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil?"</p>
            <p>Our Heavenly Benefactor is to be praiſed in that he hath raiſed <hi>one</hi> to the head of our national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, in whom all thoſe virtues remarkably cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which qualified him for office, and rendered him ſo <hi>univerſally</hi> and <hi>peculiarly</hi> acceptable to the people. In this view of divine goodneſs, and the favour granted us, we may adopt the ſentiments which were entertained in the contemplation of Solomon's wiſdom and excellence, and which were expreſſed in theſe words—"Bleſſed be the Lord thy God, who delighted in thee, to ſet thee on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God; becauſe thy God loved Iſrael to eſtabliſh them forever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and juſtice."</p>
            <p>We cloſe with obſerving, that the death which we now lament gives us a ſolemn leſſon on human frailty. The "prophets lived not forever." "Samuel died, and all Iſrael lamented him, and buried him in his own ſepulchre at Ramah." WASHINGTON, our friend and benefactor, is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037663_0028_100F358DCEBFF870"/>
dead, and laid in his own tomb at Mount Vernon. He, who has ſtood protected while thouſands have fallen around him, has now paſt the vale of death, after a ſhort indiſpoſition. He, who was raiſed to the ſummit of human glory, dies like other men. He, who has made legions of invading foes to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, muſt himſelf ſubmit to the irreſiſtible power of the king of terrors. He, whoſe perſon was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, and whom multitudes ſought to behold, is now hidden from the eyes of mortals, and left to moulder back to duſt. He, who gave laws to millions, muſt himſelf ſubmit to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of his Maker. Thus "the world is paſſing away"—the glory of kingdoms is fading. "The wiſe and reverend head" muſt lie on a level with others. In the judgment of the Great Day, there will be no diſtinction, but that which ariſes from different tempers of heart: Though the death of the righteous cauſe grief, <hi>yet to them it is gain.</hi> While their memory is bleſſed on earth, their ſpirits aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the perfect and endleſs enjoyment of God. Glory and praiſe to the riches of that grace which brings the departed ſaint to the triumphant ſong—"<hi>O Death, where is thy ſting? O Grave, where is thy victory?"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſerve God with faithfulneſs in the different ſpheres of action in which his providence hath
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037663_0029_100F358F5C337B80"/>
placed us, is the great buſineſs of life—the way to a happy death, and to an eternal reſt with Chriſt, in his kingdom of unfading glory.</p>
            <p>May we be thus wiſe, and bleſſed of God, through Jeſus Chriſt. AMEN.</p>

            <head>AN HISTORICAL SKETCH.</head>
            <p>"THE anceſtors of General Waſhington came from England in the year 1657. He is in the third deſcent after their migration. He was born the 11th of February (old ſtyle) 1732, at the pariſh of Waſhington, in Weſtmoreland Country, Virginia. His education was principally conducted by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate tutor. Before he attained his twentieth year, he was raiſed to the inſpection of a military diſtrict in Virginia, with the rank of Major. In 1753, when he was little more than twenty-one years of age, he was appointed an agent to treat with the French, who had made encroachments on the territories of the then Britiſh colonies at the weſtward. He was entruſted with plenary power for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this important buſineſs, and purſued the duties of his miſſion with ſingular induſtry, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and addreſs; but had not the happineſs to prevent a war between England and France. The next year, 1754, he was appointed Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel in the Virginia regiment. The chief colonel dying the ſame year, without joining the regiment, the command and rank of Colonel devolved on him. He formed a plan to eſtabliſh poſts for the defence of the frontiers, at the confluence of the

Allegany and Monongahela rivers. Purſuing this object, with only 400 effective men, he was met with an army of the enemy, computed at 1500, and after a gallant and well-managed defence, in which more than one third of his men were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and wounded, he was obliged to capitulate. He, however, ſecured the important condition of retiring with the honours of war; but his men were brutally plundered by the Indians.</p>
            <p>"In 1755 the Britiſh government ſent Gen. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock with an army to repel theſe invaders. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was received as Aid-de Camp to Gen. Braddock, with the rank of Colonel." Preſident Davies, in a ſermon preached to Capt. Overton's company of volunteers, who were raiſed in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia for this expedition, bore this honourable and prophetic teſtimony in favour of the ſince Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the American armies:—Said he, "I point out to the public that heroic youth, Col. Waſhington, whom I cannot but hope Providence has hitherto preſerved in ſo ſignal a manner for ſome important ſervice to his country."</p>

               <p>In this year was the memorable battle and defeat of Braddock, at the Monongahela. Gen. Braddock was killed, and all his officers, who were obliged to be on horſeback, were killed or wounded, excepting Col. Waſhington; who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played great fortitude and military ſkill in ſaving the wreck of this mutilated army. Soon after this, on account of his ſingular merit, he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the command of all the troops raiſed and to be raiſed in Virginia. He continued to diſplay his military talents in the defence of the frontiers. In 1758 he commanded a van brigade in the capture of fort Du Queſne.</p>
               <p>The ſucceſs of this campaign having ſecured tranquillity to the middle colonies, and his health being extremely impaired, in 1759 he reſigned his appointment.</p>

He gradually recovered his health—married Mrs. Cuſtis, a reſpectable young widow—ſettled on his eſtate at Mount Vernon, and gave his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to agriculture. After he left the army in '59 he was conſtantly a member of the Virginia Aſſembly, a magiſtrate of his county, and a judge of the court," until the year 1774, when he was elected a delegate to the firſt Continental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. In 1775 he was appointed Commander in Chief of the continental army. From this time he ſubmitted to more than "Herculean labours" in watching the movements of an inſidious and powerful foe, and in bringing his variable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined army to the moſt promiſing point of reſiſtance.</p>

            <p>Under the moſt depreſſive circumſtances—in want of a regular force competent to the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the day—in want of food, clothing and pay for his ſuffering companions in the field—his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity and truſt in Providence ſupported his hope. The ſufferings of his army, in the want of a generous and promiſed ſubſiſtence, excited re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated mutinies among the ſoldiery, and awakened the moſt threatening diſcontents among many of his officers. Theſe ſeaſons of moſt imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger arouſed his powers of oratory, in which there was unparalleled perſuaſion, which ſuſtained our cauſe, and ſaved our country.</p>

This event (the capture of lord Cornwallis and the Britiſh army under his command, which took place in October, 1781) laid a foundation for peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and Great Britain. Peace was realized in 1783. In 1787 General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was elected Preſident of the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention

The firſt Congreſs, under the new conſtitution, convened March, 1787, and on the 30th of April GEORGE WASHINGTON was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Preſident of the United States.

In '98 he was appointed General and Commander in Chief of the Armies of the United States, of which he accepted; in this, giving the moſt impreſſive evidence of his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his country, and that the greatneſs of his mind was above the punctilios of rank.—He died December 14th, 1799, Aet. 68.</p>
