            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A VERY ſhort, but a very ſerious, pathetical and pleaſant <hi>Prayer</hi> this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Happy the man that is able to make it, and happy the People among whom there are many that can ſolemnly make it. It is an <hi>Appeal</hi> to God reſpecting the faithful love and religious regards we bear to our <hi>Country,</hi> and to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of God in it. It is a lifting up our hand to Heaven, and ſwearing by Him that liveth and ruleth there, and to him to whom we owe and ſhou'd bear true Faith and allegiance for ever and ever; that in our reſpective places we do and will live and act for Him and his People. It is in effect to ſay (and how awful is ſuch an <hi>Oath</hi> to God) <hi>ſo</hi> think upon me my God for Good, <hi>as</hi> I think upon this People with a ſincere deſire of their Good. Who of us now dare aſſume the Words before the LORD, our King and our Judge? And yet who of us is there that may be Excuſable before him if we are
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001949_0008_0FBA43A100E81DE0"/>
not able to do it? The man whoſe Conſcience tells him that he bears an honeſt heart to his Country and the Religion of God in it, he may humbly make the <hi>Prayer</hi> and take the Comfort of it.</p>
            <p>LET us now conſider the <hi>Man</hi> that firſt made it, the <hi>Time</hi> and the Occaſion of his making it, and then the <hi>Prayer</hi> by it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE great &amp; good <hi>Man</hi> that made it was <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who was twelve years <hi>Governour of Judea under Artexerxes King of Perſia.</hi> He was a very pious and excellent Ruler, <hi>a Man that came to ſeek the Welfare of the Children of Iſrael.</hi> His whole ſtory diſcovers a very deep Tincture of ſerious Piety in his Soul, that he was a man of much Devotion and very frequent and ſolemn in Prayer. The ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and of <hi>Jehoſhaphat, Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> reſted upon him in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>WE may profitably obſerve what bro't him to his Government, and with what Diſpoſition of Mind he came, and on what Motives. He came not for Honour, or Riches, for he had eno' of theſe before, and knew, when he had eno', and had a heart large eno' not only to uſe 'em for his own Comfort, but to ſpend 'em for the public Good. He had been the Kings <hi>Cup-bearer</hi>; an Office of high Honour and great Favour, and the Profit was to be ſure equal to the Dignity of the Poſt. By this he ſtood in the Preſence of the King, and attended at his
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001949_0009_0FBA43A24EDAE310"/>
Table in the Month of his Waiting, and <hi>gave the Wine into his Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NEITHER did he come to enjoy Eaſe and Pleaſure. He might have had more of theſe at the Court. They that dwell in Kings Palaces go in ſoft Cloathing, live ſumptuouſly and fare deliciouſly every day. The danger there is of ſurfeiting in ſoft pleaſures. It may be that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the rather left it for that Reaſon. And for what, in Exchange, did he forſake the Voluptuous ſcene? for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in its Ruines! and <hi>the Remnant of the Captivity in great affliction and Reproach</hi>? This was what well became his Vertue and Devotion. He preferred the very duſt of <hi>Zion</hi> to the Gardens of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the broken Walls and Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Palaces of <hi>Shuſhan.</hi> He had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> eaſe in them.</p>
            <p>IN a word, as the Caſe was truly Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and ſo the Reaſon of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> ſeeking the Government of <hi>Judah,</hi> even the Melancholy account that was given him of the preſent State of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; ſo in a very Extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he prepared himſelf for the ſervice of his Country; <hi>He ſat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and faſted and prayed to the God of Heaven</hi>; and his moſt excellent Prayer which he prayed on this Occaſion is recorded in the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of this <hi>Book.</hi> Now it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the like Solemnity is not neceſſary in every Commiſſion for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of a <hi>Province</hi>; No, far otherwiſe; it may be much rather eſteem'd a Circumſtance of life calling for a devout <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> to God: But only let there be an Acknowledgement of the Divine Providence governing our Changes and chuſing for us our reſpective Offices; let us have a ſenſe of our Dependance on God, our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to him and our Accountableneſs, and let us be humbly ſeeking his Preſence, Influence and Help always, without which we ſhall never diſcharge the Duties of the moſt Inferior Truſt.</p>

<q>Who in my Eye (ſays a late pious Expoſitor) tho' he never wore a Crown, nor commanded an Army, nor conquer'd any Country, nor was fam'd for Philoſophy or Oratory; yet being a pious praying Man and a ſingular Servant of the Church of God in his day, was really a Greater Man and more Honourable, not only than any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls or Dictators, but than <hi>Xenophon,</hi> or <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf, who liv'd at the ſame time the bright Ornaments of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. LET us obſerve at what <hi>time</hi> &amp; upon what <hi>Occaſion</hi> it was that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prayed the Words of my Text; It was ſome time after his arrival at his Government, and entrance upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration thereof. For as ſoon as he came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and had publiſh'd his Commiſſion, he did inſtantly and with great Diligence
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001949_0011_0FBA43A6D46E7030"/>
apply himſelf to the Work he came about, the Duties of his High Station. This he did with great Integrity and Honour: He did not loſe a day in Diverſions, but ſet himſelf to Buſineſs. He built the Wall of Jeruſalem, and took care for the Repleniſhing the Holy City He took the Number of his People, he redreſs'd their Grievances, and reform'd divers great Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Abuſes. He look'd to their Morals and led them in the Worſhip of God. He call'd 'em to thoſe ſolemnities of Religion which their preſent State made ſuitable, even to Faſting and Prayer, and their Renewing their Covenant with GOD.</p>
            <p>IN this pious and princely manner did his Zeal, Piety and Charity work, with unknown Induſtry and Labour. And it is ſcarce to be ſaid in what his Vertue moſt appear'd, or in what Vertue he moſt Excell'd; whether in Generoſity to the public, in Tenderneſs to the poor and needy, in Compaſſion to the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, in Courage toward the Rich and Great, the Rulers and Nobles; or in Indignation againſt the wicked, the ſenſual, the profane; the cruel and unjuſt man.</p>
            <p>INDEED there are ſome things here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of this moſt Excellent Governour, which tho' they were truly Glorious in Him, yet ſtrictly are not to be bro't into Example. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly we are told in the Verſes juſt before the Text, <hi>that from the Time he took the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment He did not eat the Bread of the Governour.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001949_0012_0FBA43AA02008320"/>
He was not chargeable to 'em as his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had been. He ſerv'd 'em for nothing, he was ſo rich and they ſo poor, and his heart was as big as his purſe; nay he made his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants work for the public <hi>Gratis,</hi> whereas <hi>the ſervants of the former Governours bare rule over the people</hi>; ſqueezing them with one pretended Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite or another. But <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was too much a Father to his People, and <hi>a Fearer of God</hi> to allow this. He neither durſt do it nor was he Inclin'd to do it.</p>
            <p>YET he kept the <hi>Table</hi> of a Prince, while he wou'd not require or accept the Bread of the Governour. There were at his Table daily an hundred and fifty of the Jews and Rulers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Strangers; and accordingly there was daily prepar'd for him one Ox and ſix choice Sheep; with Fowls in ſome proportion, and once in ten days ſtore of all ſorts of Wine; and yet for all this he did not require the Bread of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, becauſe the Bondage was heavy upon the People.</p>
            <p>NOW I ſay this is not to be bro't into Example to oblige Governours in other places and times, and not in like Circumſtances, to do the like. No, It wou'd be very vain and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to pretend it. All that a Governour or Ruler is to learn from this Noble ſpirit and action is this, to be Generous, to be tender of a People, to conſider his own and their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; to moderate his Deſires after Gain, not to extort and ſqueeze himſelf, nor to let any that are under him do ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:001949_0013_0FBA43AC4B12A7E0"/>
               <hi>NEHEMIAH</hi> had the Heart of a Chriſtian, (for the Godly are juſt alike under both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) and who can read the Record of his noble Deeds without remembring the Words of our Lord Jeſus which he ſpake, It is more bleſſed to give than to receive. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.25. It argues a more bleſſed Diſpoſition, and infers a more bleſſed State.</p>
            <p>AFTER all, Few Governours are rich like <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> He had amaſs'd great Riches in the Perſian Court, and had been wont to live mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently. And now he piouſly (and I had almoſt ſaid profuſely) ſpends it in the Service of the poor afflicted Church. He liv'd of his own in great State and Expence, for he had (he knew) wherewith to do it. And bleſſed be God, Our Circumſtances are not like thoſe of the Remnant of the Captivity. We are poor eno' 'tis true, but not like them; nor are our Spirits lowr'd like theirs with our Condition. Look on us, and judge how poor we be! Look on our Cloathing, our Furniture; our Tables, our Children; and if it were not for ſhame I had ſaid our <hi>Balls,</hi> and ſay if we be Poor! Judge by our Idle hours and Idle Expences! if we are rich in theſe we muſt not be poor only to the State and Church. We are well able to do much more than ever we yet have done for the honourable Support both of the Magiſtracy and the Miniſtry, and ſhould be never the poorer for it.</p>
            <p>AND ſo much for the time wherein <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> utter'd this prayer, a prayer which every
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001949_0014_0FBA43ADD58A5FB0"/>
now &amp; then we find him repeating, and always beautiful in him becauſe ſeaſonably utter'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I COME now to conſider the Prayer by it ſelf: <hi>Think upon me my God for Good, according to all that I have d ne for this People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF ever the words can become a Mortals mouth they became his. We muſt put an humble Chriſtian ſenſe upon 'em, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Boaſting. Here's nothing in 'em but what is modeſt, lowly and abaſing before God; Nothing Vain-glorious, but altogether gracious and devout. He could comfortably remember what he had done, and pray over it; and he knew how to pray, was us'd to it, even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God of his Covenant Faithfulneſs and promiſed Mercies.</p>
            <p>HERE Obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE happy <hi>Freedom</hi> and Confidence with which he addreſſes God. <hi>My God.</hi> He claims, he pleads an Intereſt in him, a Relation to him. My God, <hi>whoſe I am and whom I ſerve.</hi> By God he rul'd, and for him only; by his Word and according to his Will, and for his Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. HIS Requeſt. <hi>Think upon me.</hi> In which I wou'd remark two things, his Modeſty and his Faith.</p>
            <p>Firſt, THE <hi>Modeſty</hi> of his Petition. He asks to be tho't upon. Beſtow a kind tho't upon me, my God. That ſhall be eno' to me, if my
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001949_0015_0FBA43AF1622CB38"/>
God will but think upon me! that ſhall be my pay and my exceeding Great Reward for all my Services to the Public. He look'd for no Recompence from men, nay ſome of them it may be might think, ſpeak and reward to him Evil for Good; but if God will remember his Good Deeds and not blot them out, he deſires no more.</p>
            <p>AND yet it is a Great thing that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> asks, and what the Greateſt and beſt of men are not worthy of. What, for the Great GOD of Heaven to beſtow a Tho't upon man that is a Worm, and the ſon of man that is a Worm! When we conſider his Heavens,— <hi>Lord what is man</hi> that thou art mindful of him! Yet many O Lord, and wonderful are thy Tho'ts to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward! It is a Requeſt meet for a <hi>Favourite</hi> to his Prince. <hi>Let my Lord remember his Handmaid.</hi> If he ſays, I'll think of you, I'll remember you, it is eno'.</p>
            <p>Secondly, THE <hi>Faith</hi> of this prayer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. Nehemiah believed in God, and truſted that he wou'd remember him for Good. He comforted himſelf thus, My God thinketh on me. He came to God believing that he is a Rewarder. He believ'd that his God would think upon him? 1. for Good. 2. according to all his Good Deeds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>FOR Good.</hi> Such are God's Tho'ts; <hi>thoughts of Good and not of Evil.</hi> Think upon me my God, but not to mark my ſin. No, for then
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001949_0016_0FBA43B276DA5008"/>
who cou'd ſtand? let theſe be blotted out for ever &amp; caſt away. Remember them no more. But if there has been any thing ever done in ſincerity let my good God remember it. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Goodneſs remember me, for thy mercy ſake; O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THINK upon me my God and aſſiſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, protect, ſucceed and proſper me. Think upon me and accept me in my deſires to ſerve thee and thy people: Let me find Grace in thy ſight. Think upon me to remunerate as thou pleaſeſt, of thy free Grace, rich bounty and ſovereign Mercy: Bleſs me my God, both in Temporals and Spirituals, but eſpecially the latter.</p>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>G to his <hi>Deeds.</hi> Without good works done by us we may not preſume to look that God will ever think of us for good. For we may know then that there is neither any good thing wro't in us, nor in reſerve for us. Yet our beſt Doings can never merit any Favour from God. 'The Reward is not of debt, but of Grace altogether. If <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father were juſtified by Works, he had whereof to glory. He believed in God which juſtifieth ſinners, and his Faith was counted to him for Righteouſneſs. Yet his Faith wro't in his Works, and by Works his Faith was made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. In like manner <hi>Nehemiah</hi> claim'd nothing as of debt, but manifeſtly asks all of meer Grace,— Think upon me, my God. Indeed he expreſſes the Conſcience he had of his own Sincerity before God, and his Faith in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001949_0017_0FBA43B613A1C1C0"/>
Promiſe and Righteouſneſs of God. He ſpake upon the Principle which David lays down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.24,—28. <hi>With an upright man Thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf Upright, with the pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf pure, and with the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward.</hi> This is the equal and righteous Rule of God's Government and Judgment.</p>
            <p>BUT this excellent man is yet more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and exact in his Petition. 1. He ſpeaks of <hi>all</hi> that he had done. 2. he ſpeaks of it as all done <hi>for this People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE was a <hi>great deal</hi> that he had done; and <hi>all</hi> in a very ſmall ſpace of time. <hi>All that I have done.</hi> God will remember <hi>all</hi> the Good we do. No one thing, not the leaſt, ſincerely meant to his Glory ſhall be overlook'd by him. A Book of Remembrance is written by him. What we forget he keeps in mind. Of <hi>all</hi> not the leaſt ſhall be forgotten; No not a cup of cold water to one of his. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.23. <hi>The Lord render to every man his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and his faithfulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT what <hi>all</hi> is this which poor, wretched, imperfect men may preſume to ſpeak of before God? A poor <hi>all</hi> at the beſt! defective and defiled by Sin! leſs than nothing in the Eyes of a Good man, whoſe Deſires ſo vaſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his attainments. What have we ever done meet for the Great and Holy God to think upon! When ye have done <hi>all</hi> ſay, We are

Unprofitable ſervants. Lord, remember not the defects &amp; the defilements of my beſt Deeds! Judge me not according to the little that I have done. And yet Comparatively one Man does a great deal more Good in the world than many others. Some do a great deal of evil here, and ſome if not ſo much hurt yet very little Good, but even in Compariſon of thoſe that do good among men ſome vaſtly excel. <hi>I laboured more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let us compare our ſelves with our betters, and think what abundance of Good ſome others have done more than we have. Let us conſider in particular <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> excellent ſpirit, diligence and labour, and comparing him with moſt other men, we may allow him to ſay,—Think upon me, my God, according to <hi>all</hi> that I have done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT was all done <hi>for this People,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what God he knew wou'd think upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIS people</hi>? why what People was it? the poor Remnant of a miſerable Captivity? a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were not now a Nation, nor ſcarce a Province! and in great affliction and reproach. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Theſe feeble Jews</hi>; as their Enemies call'd them with much Contempt. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The Bondage was heavy upon them,</hi> as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> himſelf ſays in the words before my Text.</p>

When God firſt choſe 'em they were the feweſt of any people, and continued ſo for a great while after they were choſen, while other Families increas'd into Nations and Kingdoms round about them.

            <p n="1">I. <hi>THAT we ſhould do all that we can, every one in his place and according to his power and ability for the Good of our Country.</hi> Let us Emulate <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Piety in this Heroic Inſtance of it. And indeed this is <hi>the true Heroic Vertue &amp; Piety,</hi> to endeavour in our places to deſerve well of Mankind, and in the moſt extenſive manner wherein we can to honour God in the world.</p>
            <p>NO man is made only for <hi>himſelf</hi> and his own private affairs, but to ſerve profit &amp; benefit others. We are manifeſtly formed for <hi>Society,</hi> and deſign'd by our Great Creator for a mutual dependance on and ſerviceableneſs unto each other here in the body. Both the Safety and the Pleaſure of life depend upon our joint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and purſuing this deſign. As ſoon as we read but of <hi>two</hi> men in the world, we find that God expected the one ſhould be the others <hi>Keeper.</hi> It were yet a <hi>Cainiſh</hi> temper to doubt or deny this Obligation. He was both a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer and a liar that firſt deny'd this, and 'tis pity that he has left any Children behind him in his curſed Image. <hi>Cain</hi> flew in the face of God, and did violence to nature, did outrage to his own Conſcience, when he ask'd— <hi>Am I my Brothers Keeper</hi>? Ignorant and impudent man! did he not feel that within himſelf, that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001949_0022_0FBA43C2446780A0"/>
he ought to be ſo. As <hi>Cain</hi> was of that wicked one, ſo is he of <hi>Cain</hi> who thinks himſelf not born for the Welfare of others, but meerly for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his own petty private and temporal Concerns. And like <hi>Cain</hi> he deſerves to be curſed from the earth, and driven from the face of men, as well as hid from the face of God; a fugitive and a vagabond, and afraid of every one he ſees. This is a due puniſhment of ſo barbarous a Principle. For as the man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces others, ſo muſt they him; and while he declares that others muſt look for no Good from him, they may well apprehend all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Evil and miſchief from him, and he from them again. For his Principle runs him into all manner of Injuſtice and Injury, barbarity and bloodineſs, as it did <hi>Cain</hi>; and the Earth cannot bear the monſter, but cries for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt him.</p>
            <p>A mans private and domeſtic affairs are too <hi>petite</hi> to engroſs his noble Soul; they are too ſmall and narrow a Compaſs for him to confine himſelf within. He is endow'd for much greater things, and he much debaſes himſelf if he do not think ſo.</p>
            <p>BUT our <hi>Country,</hi> and the particular <hi>Places</hi> where we dwell, are ordinarily the bounds of our Influence. Eſpecially is it ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary people, who are known only in their own Nei'bourhood, and find eno' near home to keep 'em imploy'd. And here prudence as well as charity teaches us to begin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:001949_0023_0FBA43C3DDF0CF68"/>EVERY one is to act <hi>in his own place,</hi> ſtudying to be quiet and to do his own buſineſs, in the Relation Truſt and Office which the governing Providence of God aſſigns him, and according to the Talents which the <hi>great Lord and Maſter</hi> has committed to him: But in his place he is to improve unto the utmoſt extent, the Powers which God gives him and the Opportunities which Providence preſents him with, for the doing good in the world; Modeſty and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directing him and preſerving him.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER for <hi>kind</hi> and whatever for <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> the Gift of our bountiful and gracious God be to us, ſo we muſt miniſter to the common Good, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God. For as there are many members in one body, and every member has its ſeveral place and ſervice; ſo how many and various ſoever we be, we are at laſt but one Body, and all members one of another: and having Gifts dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering according to the Grace of God beſtowed on us, we muſt ſo miniſter in proportion and for kind, with diligence and chearfulneſs. To whom much is given of him God demands the more, and of every one according to <hi>that</hi> he has received; as the Husbandman looks to reap that which he ſowes, and in proportion to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſown.</p>
            <p>IF a man receive <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (and largeneſs of heart like <hi>Solomon</hi>) from the Father of light, he muſt be liberal and communicative thereof for the benefit of the world; as men do not light a candle and put it under a buſhel, but ſet it on a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001949_0024_0FBA43C4D2979520"/>
Candleſtic and it giveth light to all that are in the room. If a man have <hi>Learning,</hi> and be able to ſpeak or write well, he is to conſecrate this alſo to the ſervice of God and the world; whereby he may become the Father of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Offspring, and teach the Generations to be born after his own deceaſe. If a man has <hi>Riches</hi> and a heart to do good with it, he may be not only a Father to the Poor but to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try alſo; defending it from dangers and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it from miſery. If a man have <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> it is given him immediately for the Public Service, for he is Gods Miniſter attending continually on this very thing. Or if a man has <hi>Reputation</hi> and Credit, and an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in thoſe that have Power, this alſo is a happy Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be improv'd carefully after the Example of <hi>Eſther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> for the welfare of their People. Again, if a man have <hi>Courage</hi> and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, or bodily Strength, let him not imploy it in injurious hectoring and brutal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting his Nei'bours, but as the <hi>Worthies of David</hi> who ſo't immortal fame and got their Names enroll'd among the <hi>firſt and ſecond Three</hi> by the Dangers which they fac'd in the cauſe of God and his Iſrael. 2 Sam. 10.12. <hi>Be of good Courage and let us play the Men, for our People, and for the Cities of our God.</hi> Or again, if <hi>Policy</hi> and depth for Counſel be a mans Accompliſhment, let him make good uſe of it, as <hi>Huſhai</hi> did in defeating the ſubtle and pernicious counſel of <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> and for the preſervation of his King &amp; Country. But if a perſon have <hi>Nothing</hi> conſiderable in his

own outward Circumſtances or inward Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to diſtinguiſh him, yet if he have but an honeſt and willing Mind to do what he can, he will find many an Opportunity to ſerve the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and contribute to the weal of his Country. The meaneſt muſt not be diſcouraged, nor may be excuſed: he muſt not ſay of himſelf, <hi>I am a dry tree,</hi> a low and uſeleſs ſhrub; nor may others deſpiſe him as inſignificant: for tho' he may not be likely to do much, yet God will accept his little, and it may prove a great deal more than he thinks for. Yea indeed a vaſt deal of good we ſometimes ſee done by Perſons of ſmall powers, either natural or acquir'd, where there is but diſcretion and application. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in fact a matter of Experience does infer a ſtrong Obligation upon all, and is a powerful Motive for the leaſt to be doing what they can. For ſmall Attempts and leſs Expectations have been ſometimes crown'd with vaſt effects.</p>
            <p>IF what has been already ſaid be not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to convince us of our Obligation to propoſe and purſue the common good of our Country, I appeal then to the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of every man, Whether his own heart do not approve &amp; applaud ſuch a Diſpoſition as very excellent in it ſelf. What elſe can at preſent fully anſwer the End of thy Being, rational Endowments, and the Relation thou beareſt to Mankind? can you be good, and juſt in your Place without it? can the Being and End of Humane Society be anſwer'd without it? is not this one point wherein men
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001949_0026_0FBA43C856D2B660"/>
have preheminence above the beaſts? Nay is it not a kind of Inſtinct in Nature, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable and irreſiſtible; a ſecret invincible affection to ones Country, as unto ſome natural Relation in blood? and does it not afford a man a noble and laſting ſatisfaction if he has been honour'd to do it ſervice? is it not agreeable to <hi>humane nature</hi> to be generous, compaſſionate, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, grateful, beneficent? and is it not the Image of the Great Creator inſtamp'd upon us, who is good to all and has a tender Care over all his Works?
<q>Nay are not the worſt of men themſelves aſham'd to avow Self-intereſt as a Principle of their actions, as being conſcious to themſelves that it is the baſeſt of all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? The practice of benignity, of courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, of clemency (ſayes Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi>) do at firſt ſight without the aid of any diſcurſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, obtain approbation and applauſe from men; being acceptable and amiable to their mind as beauty to their ſight, harmony to their hearing, fragrancy to their ſmell, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their taſte. It cannot be (ſayes Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>) that God ſhould give man <hi>Solitary Principles</hi> and yet intend him for Public Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe? make his Intereſt depend upon Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Affection, and at the ſame time create him ſo as natually to care for nothing but himſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT while I am upon this head, proving our Obligation to a <hi>General Kindneſs</hi> and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Spirit from the light of Nature, it may not be amiſs to remark ſomething of the noble ſenſe
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001949_0027_0FBA43C960DC2BA0"/>
that the <hi>Romans</hi> had in this matter. I will name three only, <hi>Cato, Cicero,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi>; and add to them the Principles of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>CATO</hi> the Younger was an admir'd and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated lover of his Country, and a very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful zealous aſſerter of the rights &amp; liberties of it. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us among other things, that when his friends could not perſwade him to ſtand for the <hi>Tribune-ſhip,</hi> yet when <hi>Metellus</hi> was put up from whom he feared danger to the State, he preſently ſtood for the Place himſelf and carry'd it; for the People look'd upon him (ſayes the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi>) not as one that deſir'd a favour of them, but one that ſought it to do his Country a kindneſs, and that he might defend their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Government. Wherefore at another time when by his courage and wiſdom in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Clodius,</hi> he had driven him out of Town, (he had made him appear ſo infamous) and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> came to thank him for it; he anſwer'd, <hi>Thank the Common-wealth,</hi> for whoſe ſake alone it is that I do every thing.</p>
            <p>INDEED <hi>Cicero</hi> was of the ſame noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and a like worthy Patriot to his Country. He was the man among the <hi>Romans</hi> that firſt had that ſingular <hi>Style</hi> of honour decreed him, <hi>Pater patriae, the Father of his Country</hi> A dignity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to the being born to Empire over it. And it is remarkable that <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf who had Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed him to the Malice of <hi>Antonius</hi> for his own Advancement to the Imperial Chair, yet honour'd his Memory for his faithful Oppoſition
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001949_0028_0FBA43CE1C445BD0"/>
to him in that deſign: for <hi>Caeſar</hi> viſiting his Dau'ters Son found him with a Book of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s in his hand; the Boy for fear endeavour'd to hid it under his gown; which <hi>Caeſar</hi> perceiving took it from him, and after he had turn'd over a great part of it gave it him again, ſaying, My Child, this was a Learned man and <hi>a lover of his Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will only add a ſaying of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> one of the beſt of the <hi>Roman Emperors.</hi> As you are a member of a Society, ſo every action of yours ſhould tend to the benefit and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. So that when you do any thing that has neither immediate nor remote reference to general advantage, you make a breach in the common Intereſt, deſtroy the Unity of Public life, and are as really guilty of Seditious behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as a Male-content that imbroils the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>THIS Principle was well worthy of <hi>Him</hi> that was at the Head of the World, and indeed the Happineſs and Glory of the <hi>Empire</hi> ſeem'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in him. Such were the Principles of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> "That we ſhould love all Man kind heartily,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gatakers</hi> Prelim. diſc.</note> ſolicit their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, bear with their Infirmities, and do no manner of injury to any man: "That a man ſhould not think himſelf born for his private Satisfaction, but exert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Public, and make his life as ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant to the world as it is poſſible: "That the Conſcience of a good action ſhould content a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001949_0029_0FBA43CF56B7EEE8"/>
man, without the proſpect of fame and reward: that he ought never to be tir'd with the exerciſe of good nature, — but look upon a generous action as a reward to it ſelf. Theſe are ſome of the noble Sentences which we find in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> which <hi>Chriſtians</hi> may read with bluſhes, reflecting on their own defects in practice.</p>
            <p>NOT but that the Precepts of <hi>CHRIST OUR SAVIOUR</hi> do far excel all that <hi>Seneca, Cicero, Epictetus, Antoninus</hi> or all the <hi>Maſters of Morality</hi> have ſaid on this Argument; and from hence it is that our Obligations riſe higher than theirs cou'd to live unto the benefit of others. And as it much rather becomes me in this desk, ſo it ſhould be much more acceptable unto a Chriſtian Audience, to obſerve the excelling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Goſpel on this Argument. For we are inſtructed from the <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> "To <hi>love our Nei'bours as our ſelves; "Whatſoever we would that men ſhould do to us to do the ſame to them, and "as we have opportunity to do good to all men, eſpecially unto the houſhold of faith; "That we ſhould deny our ſelves, and that NONE OF US LIVETH TO HIMSELF; "That no man ſhould ſeek his own ſingly, but every man his brothers wealth; "That we look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others; "That we be kindly affectioned one to another in brotherly love, in honour preferring one another; "That nothing be done thro' ſtrife and vain glory, but in lowlineſs of mind that each eſteem other better than himſelf.</hi>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:001949_0030_0FBA43D193805710"/>WHEN I look over theſe <hi>Superiour Laws of revealed Religion,</hi> and contemplate the Divine Life of our <hi>SAVIOUR,</hi> and how his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> excelled after him in a noble living to the Good of others, Temporal and Eternal; it puts out all the <hi>Lights of the Gentile world,</hi> as the Stars do diſappear at the riſing of the <hi>Sun.</hi> The <hi>Phylanthropy</hi> of our Saviour was more than <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</hi> It was a <hi>God-like life of love to mankind.</hi> No words can at all adorn the Pattern and the Precept of Goodneſs and Benignity which he has left us.

And this they did on thoſe Spiritual Principles, Reaſons and Motives, which never enter'd into the Morals of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> but are peculiar to the Goſpel of the Grace of God.

that Authority and Power enables a Man to do a great deal of good; and is uſually attended with riches and reputation; and we ought to ſuppoſe with wiſdom and knowlege; all which procure Men more or leſs intereſt abroad and influence at home. Moreover, <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God for this very end, and the Oath of God is upon Rulers to intend the Public Good. There is no power but of God, and the Powers that be are ordained of Him; and to Him they are accountable. They are rais'd by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and muſt themſelves be govern'd in their high ſtation by his Word, and rule for his Glory and the welfare of their People. Rom. 13.4. <hi>For he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good.</hi> To ſerve hereunto is the true honour and noble pleaſure of Life; but the damage and miſchief is infinite if the Ruler departs from this point, either by negligence or wilful abuſe of his Power. The good Providence which is equally over us all, and which concerns itſelf for every Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and much more for the Body of a People collectively, immediately takes notice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity to Heaven and the Injury to Men: <hi>What is thy Mother? a lioneſs?</hi> a She-bear, that ſhou'd have been a Parent and a nurſing Mother.</p>
            <p>WHETHER we conſider the <hi>Ruler</hi> in his Legiſlative or Executive truſt, the making Laws or the ſeeing to the execution of them, he is in both a Servant to the Public, and is to have the weal of his People at heart.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>THE reverend Worſhip of God among our People.</hi> This was ever the firſt Care of the Godly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Iſrael, from the days of <hi>Moſes</hi> down to the Reign of good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and how pleaſing to God and beneficial to the Public this pious care was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let the whole hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

This is the trueſt Charity to the Public, and the leaſt Reverence to God that the Government of a People can expreſs; and as the proſperity of a People depends on the favour and bleſſing of God, ſo it has been ever experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd that the keeping cloſe to the Inſtitutions of God reſpecting his worſhip, is the way to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Divine favour and bleſſing to a People; whereof the ſtory of <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> are notorious and famous Evidence, and an Example to the Church for ever.</p>
            <p>IF then (<hi>our honoured Fathers</hi>) you think in your Conſciences that the Worſhip of God in theſe Churches, the Miniſtry of the Land and the Orders of Gods houſe here, are as near to the Rule of Gods word, and anſwer as well the Great Ends of Holineſs and Devotion, if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that what others may more eſteem &amp; prefer; then as you honour God and value the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of this People, ſpiritual or temporal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide by and adhere to the ſupport and defence of thoſe Methods of religious Worſhip which we are in.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:001949_0041_0FBA43E693484B68"/>BUT do it with Meekneſs and Charity; for your <hi>Platform</hi> pretends not to perfection, nor to impoſe an <hi>Uniformity</hi> on the Churches; which is neither neceſſary nor conducive to external Order nor unto Chriſtian Unity, to peace, truth or vital Piety.</p>
            <p>BUT if it might pleaſe the Government to go further into the Counſel, the expence &amp; travel, for the Inſtruction of the <hi>Natives,</hi> the Miſſion of Miniſters into the <hi>dark &amp; looſe places</hi> of the land, where the Inhabitants are averſs to the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Ordinances of the Goſpel among them, and the aſſiſting our <hi>New Plantations</hi> in their Infancy to have the Preaching of Gods word among them; I judge theſe would be ſo many acts of Piety highly acceptable to heaven, and from which under the bleſſing of Providence both Church and State would reap unknown Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>

and from the Judgments and wrath of God. Exert the power with which God has arm'd and honour'd you againſt Vices and Immoralities which pollute a land &amp; provoke the Divine anger.

For theſe vices ſap the foundation of ſociety, peace, ſafety &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual comfort; and are therefore ſo vehemently abhorred and forbidden by God, who has given us his laws for our good.

            <p n="4">4. IN the next place I would humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>the honourable and careful ſupport of Learning</hi> among this People. It is <hi>this</hi> that has honour'd us among the <hi>Provinces,</hi> and been the ſupport of that Religion and vertue which is left among us. Our wiſe and pious <hi>Fathers</hi> in the Settlement of the Country planted <hi>Schools</hi> as well as Churches in every Town. Religion and Learning were their equal Care; and I truſt will be their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens. Hence it is that they have left an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed Seed as at this day. That happy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation the COLLEGE, ſupply'd from the <hi>Grammar Schools</hi> thro' the <hi>Province,</hi> has not only ſent forth a number of worthy men for the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, but alſo for every Chair of honour in the Government. Not only have our Churches had a ſucceſſion of <hi>Paſtors,</hi> but the State alſo of <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Counſellors,</hi> and ſome moſt Excellent <hi>Governours</hi> have our <hi>Provinces</hi> ſeen, the fair Sons of that beautiful <hi>Academy.</hi> And whatever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays the <hi>Province</hi> languiſhes under in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>College</hi> ſeems to renew its Youth, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001949_0045_0FBA43EC96E0D790"/>
has been ſending out of late a vigorous Iſſue, who in brightneſs of Parts, and alſo in Vertue promiſe to excel. And now we have the Joy to come before You, <hi>our civil Fathers,</hi> as the Sons of the Prophets once did to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> ſaying, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now the Place is too <hi>ſtrait</hi> for the increas'd numbers of your Sons! will you pleaſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Houſe for them to dwell in? We truſt you will kindly anſwer ſo reaſonable, ſo welcome a deſire; and moſt readily build on a Foundation which our Fathers laid and which our God has ſignally bleſſed. For what Parents are there that being able, do not naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thus to ſettle their hopeful Progeny!</p>
            <p>BUT, <hi>my Fathers,</hi> what ſignifies a <hi>College</hi> if there be not a previous care about inferiour <hi>Schools,</hi> in your ſeveral Towns? Let theſe live I beſeech you; let 'em be worthily ſupplied and decently ſupported; let not the Law in that matter be any where ſcandalouſly evaded. If our Schools languiſh ſo will the State &amp; Church too. We ſhall ſoon grow an Irreligious and a contemptible People if we decay in good Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. The Education of our Youth is of the laſt Importance to our future flouriſhing in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in piety, in arts, in riches, in wiſdom and reputation. What had we been at this day if it had not been for the pious care of our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> in this matter? and what will our Poſterity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come if we degenerate from them in this point? What will the Government become? and what the Miniſtry? We ſhall have no <hi>ſtrong Rods</hi> to bear rule, nor <hi>able Miniſters of the New Teſtament.</hi>

Nor will the world believe that we are the Sons of <hi>New-England,</hi> whoſe diſtinguiſhing Character among the Plantations has been <hi>Sobriety, Modeſty and Literature.</hi> But we have found ſo much the Benefit of Learning that I will not give my ſelf leave to doubt of your faithful care for it. So let your Love abound in knowledge and in all judgment.</p>

And now this private Spirit grows manifeſtly upon us from year to year; every body raiſing the price of their own Commodity, and thoſe the Neceſſaries of life more than the Superfluities; and every body acting by one common rule of Mutual Oppreſſion, namely <hi>to get what they can,</hi> without any conſcientious tender regards to the rule of Juſtice and Mercy, at leaſt in the preſent diſtreſs. And I would in particular offer it to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of my People, Whether the poorer <hi>Trades-men</hi> among us are not too much oppreſſed in the payments that are now in uſe.

forc'd to take half in <hi>Goods</hi> when they need it not for their Families, and ſo are led to go above their degree in cloaths, and to take unneceſſary furniture for their houſes; and what muſt be the End of this at long run but great damage, not to ſay ruine, to the Publick?</p>
            <p>TRULY I fear, unleſs it pleaſes God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke this private Spirit among us, that in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time the <hi>oppreſſion of our Poor</hi> may come to be near as great as that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whereof there was ſo great a cry made in our Context, whoſe ſufferings <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did as well ſet himſelf to redreſs, as he did the Sabbath-breaking and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure mixtures. The <hi>Poor</hi> had run themſelves in debt for corn that they might eat and live; they had mortgag'd their lands, their vineyards and houſes to buy bread; they had borrow'd money for the Kings Tribute, to pay their taxes; by which means they and their children were bro't into bondage, and it was no ways in their power to redeem themſelves. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heard this his Anger was very great at the Oppreſſors. He rebuk'd 'em, he call'd <hi>a General Aſſembly</hi> to redreſs the wrong. He reaſon'd the caſe with 'em and convinc'd 'em by his Arguments. He preſs'd 'em to releaſe their poor debtors, and never to exact again upon them in like manner. He got a promiſe of 'em, he made 'em ſwear it, and then he bound 'em by a Curſe to keep their Oath; He ſhook his lap and ſaid, — <hi>So God ſhake out every man from his houſe and from his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that performeth not this promiſe; even thus be

            <p>AND now that I have preſum'd to name the KING, how can I better illuſtrate the <hi>Subject</hi> I am upon, or what like powerful and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Argument</hi> can I ſet before your <hi>Excellency</hi> and his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>Council,</hi> the Honourable Houſe of <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> and all his <hi>Leige People,</hi> as his own Illuſtrious <hi>Example,</hi> and generous extenſive will for the Good of his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

            </p>
            <p>I have but one <hi>Motive</hi> more to urge you with, <hi>my Honoured Fathers,</hi> and it is a very <hi>Melancholly</hi> one, the mention whereof ſhould be very affecting to us this day. It is this, <hi>Your time of Public Action for the Service of God, your King and Country is very ſhort.</hi> We ſeldom come much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Public Service and influence, till we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending

from the Hill of life to our graves. You muſt be working therefore the works of him that ſends you while it is day, the night cometh. You have awfully ſeen this <hi>dark year</hi> that you muſt die like other men. No leſs than <hi>four of His Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>Council</hi> have we bury'd in this Town ſince the laſt <hi>Election,</hi> and I hear of no leſs than <hi>ten</hi> of <hi>the Houſe of Repreſentatives</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd this laſt Winter, beſides <hi>a Generation of pious uſeful Men</hi> thro' the Province, and moſtly <hi>Aged</hi> perſons, a great part of our glory and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. It becomes me in this <hi>Audience</hi> and on this <hi>Occaſion</hi> again to bewail thoſe breaches on the Public, and to drop a freſh tear over the graves of ſo many worthy perſons lately taken from our heads. And while we riſe up and bleſs their Memory, let men in Public place hear the Voice of God more immediately directed unto them, and remember the Account they muſt ſhortly give every one of himſelf to God.</p>
            <p>YOUR WINTHROP, and your HUT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHINSONS were ſincere &amp; hearty lovers of this People, &amp; prov'd themſelves ſo in the <hi>Evil times</hi> as well as the Good which have paſs'd over us.

<q>I am juſt going off the Stage (ſaid he in his <hi>Letter</hi>) and may not live to ſee the diſtreſſing Inconveniences of ſuch a loſs; yet I can't but be in pain for my

Country and People, whoſe proſperity has been always dear to me. — I do therefore with all tender Concern for the good of this People recommend it to you that you improve all the Intereſt you can poſſibly make to ſecure our Charter privileges. Upon mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration my mind and deſire is, that if there be any rational proſpect to preſerve theſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, you ſpare no Money to effect it. — It matters little how your Endeavours may be entertain'd by men, I am well ſatisfy'd you will do what is pleaſing to heaven. And if Providence ſhould honour you to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to lengthen out the Tranquillity of this People, you will upon a juſt reflection never repent it. And whatever the event may be, I ſhall lay down my head in the Grave in greater peace, under this ſenſe that I and mine have labour'd to our utmoſt in this critical Juncture to ſerve the proſperity of our Country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THUS that <hi>Letter</hi>: And to it we very much owe the ſatisfactions we enjoy to day. I eſteem the mention I have made of it the leaſt piece of Gratitude and Juſtice due from me, as a lover of my Country; and if by it I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke to Emulation You that are my fleſh; I mean all the Sons of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now to enforce all that I have ſaid, I come to the third and laſt part of my Text, which is,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:001949_0055_0FBA44001186BD78"/>III. AN <hi>Aſſurance</hi> from GOD unto you, that <hi>He will think upon you for good according to all that any of you have done or ſhall do for this People.</hi> You may humbly look over it all, and then look up to Heaven with a lowly ſatisfaction, and ſay— <hi>think upon me my GOD for Good.</hi> God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous to forget your work &amp; labour of love. Act for his glory, in his fear, by his word, ſeek his conduct, regard his Judgment and depend on his reward.</p>
            <p>HE will think upon you and <hi>furniſh</hi> you for Service, while you think of Him and ask wiſdom of him. He'll think upon you and <hi>accept</hi> your goodwill to his Name &amp; People. He'll think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you and <hi>direct</hi> an honeſt heart into proper and ſuitable meaſures; for the way of man is not in himſelf.

Wherefore as <hi>Azariah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Aſa</hi> in a mighty Audience, — <hi>Be ſtrong and let not your hands be weak, for your Work ſhall be rewarded,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:001949_0056_0FBA4401DB97BC68"/>IN a word, Think you as you ought of God and the Public, and God will think of you <hi>tho' men forget and neglect you,</hi> or tho' they may cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and reproach you, injure and abuſe you. If worn out with <hi>Age</hi> you prudently withdraw your ſelves, and receive an honourable <hi>Quietus,</hi> or if you are laid by before in diſpleaſure or with ſlight, yet God will be with you in your eaſy receſs. But above all <hi>when you come to die,</hi> and take the final leave (as in a little time you muſt) whether of a grateful or an ungrateful world; then God will think upon you, and the Conſcience of a well ſpent life, a faithful Stewardſhip, ſhall brighten your laſt hours it may be, and be a bleſſed Earneſt of the Joy of the Lord.</p>
            <p>AND now,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>LET this be a comfortable and encouraging Word to all ſuch as love &amp; ſerve their Country.</hi> Let the bleſſing of God ever come on that <hi>Man!</hi> may the Great GOD ever think upon him for good! and let all the People ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> Let ſuch a one know that however low or ill he may think of himſelf, yet God thinks well of him. Whether you ever appear a Servant of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, or if it be never known to men that you ſerv'd it, yet God knows and notices it. Be you Young and entring the world with good and generous deſires to do good in it; <hi>Go in this thy might, — the Lord is with thee thou worthy Man!</hi> Or has God already put honour upon you, and call'd you forth upon the Public Stage; ſee to it that you ſerve your Generation according to the will of God; <hi>do worthily in Ephratah, &amp; be famous
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001949_0057_0FBA44030D230598"/>
in Bethlehem.</hi> Or be you quitting the Stage of action under the decays of age, God will ſtill think upon you <hi>in the time of old age, &amp; not forſake you when your ſtrength faileth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET me preſent before you the Record of the Conſolation enjoy'd by <hi>three</hi> brave &amp; pious Men, the <hi>one</hi> laid by by Men, the <hi>ſecond</hi> thrown by by Providence, and the <hi>laſt</hi> call'd to die ſuddenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a life of Public Service to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>THE firſt was <hi>Samuel,</hi> whom the Lord called when but a child, and continued at the head of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto old age; but when the People grew weary of him, and God bid him acquieſce and lay down, he did it gloriouſly after an unſpotted Adminiſtration. He preſented himſelf in a vaſt Aſſembly of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and dar'd to ſay to 'em, <hi>I am now old and gray-headed and my Sons are with you; and I have walked before you from my Childhood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day; Behold here I am, witneſs againſt me before the Lord and before his Anointed; Whoſe ox have I taken? or whoſe aſs have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppreſſed? or of whoſe hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? And they ſaid, Thou haſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded us, nor oppreſſed us; neither haſt thou taken ought of any mans hand. And he ſaid unto them, The Lord is witneſs, and his Anointed is witneſs this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſecond was <hi>Job, that perfect and upright man,</hi> who refreſh'd himſelf in his <hi>aſhes</hi> &amp; <hi>boils</hi> when Providence ſeem'd to have thrown him by as a broken veſſel; for <hi>his Righteouſneſs he hold faſt and would not let it go; and his heart did not
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001949_0058_0FBA4404CCF6DCE8"/>
reproach him within,</hi> tho' his ulcers were nauſeous and painful without. He remember'd how he was wont <hi>to go out to the Gate,</hi> and <hi>when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his ſeat in the ſtreet</hi>; how when <hi>the ear heard him it bleſſed him, and when the eye ſaw him it bare witneſs to him; how he delivered the poor that cryed and the fatherleſs, and how he brake the jaws of the wicked</hi>; and he appeals to God <hi>if his ſtep had turned out of the way, and his heart walk'd after his eyes, or any blot had cleaved to his hand.</hi> Thus <hi>his witneſs was in Heaven, and his record was on high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE third was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that great and good King of <hi>Judah,</hi> who being ſick unto death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a meſſage from God to ſet his houſe in order; upon which he was able to look up to God and ſay— <hi>Remember now O Lord I beſeech thee, how I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> A mighty Prayer for a <hi>dying King</hi>! happy the <hi>Ruler</hi> that can Pray thus in his laſt hours! in ſuch peace and comfort we have ſeen ſome of our faithful Rulers lately expire. And may the Conſolations of God abound to all that ſurvive in their Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WILL God think of Public Spirited Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for good? <hi>then let it be a Rule and law to us to do ſo too.</hi> It is but Juſtice and Gratitude in a People to remember and reward the Public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices &amp; Benefits done them by any. Never let our <hi>Benefactors</hi> be forgotten by us. That Country little deſerves any that is not careful and juſt to acknowledge and honour 'em. Who will think
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001949_0059_0FBA44068C591E18"/>
upon that People for good, who do not grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully think on them that do 'em great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt kindneſſes? Nay will God think upon 'em, to raiſe 'em up more friends?</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Rulers</hi> of a People are the Judges of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits or injuries done to the Public; and 'its a matter wherein they ought to ſet themſelves to judge calmly and impartially. And I am bold to ſay, they are not Public Spirited if they do it not. And if they judge in their conſciences that great Good has been done to their Country by any Perſon or Perſons, the Public thanks and regards (as the matter may require) are due to ſuch Perſons, be they of <hi>our ſelves</hi> or be they <hi>Strangers,</hi> by the ſtricteſt rules of honour and honeſty, as well as wiſdom and policy. This is an eternal Principle of truth, and rule of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE let this People ever think of them for good who are honour'd of God to do 'em good. Be they <hi>dead</hi>? let their Names live with us: let them be had in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remembrance: Do they yet <hi>remain</hi> with us? let us always think of 'em with love and honour, let us bleſs and pray for 'em, (<hi>May they live and not die, and let not their Names be few</hi>) and if need be let us ſtand by and defend 'em; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting 'em among <hi>the Good Men for whom one would even dare to die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT God forbid among us that baſe and helliſh ſpirit, which we our ſelves have known in other Places wiſer &amp; greater than we, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the beſt <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> of the Public
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001949_0060_0FBA44084E0F4610"/>
have been by ſome factiouſly and maliciouſly defam'd, bely'd, revil'd; and the vile ſlanders as eaſily taken up &amp; weakly given into by others; to the ruine of the Public, &amp; to the grief &amp; ſhame of good men that love it. Such was the guilt and wretchedneſs of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the day of <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> and the <hi>Moral of Jothams fable</hi> was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and reproach the baſe ingratitude. Mind how he introduces it, — <hi>Hearken to me ye men of Shechem that God may hearken to you!</hi> — and how he cloſes it, — <hi>Now therefore if ye have done truly and ſincerely, if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his houſe, and have done unto him according to the deſerving of his hands</hi> —. But was this only <hi>Jothams</hi> private reſentment? No, the Ingratitude was firſt to Heaven which had raiſed up <hi>Gideon</hi> for them, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſpeaks of it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, Judges 8.34, 35. <hi>And the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael remember'd not the Lord their God who had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd 'em, neither ſhewed they kindneſs to the houſe of Gideon, according to all the Goodneſs which he had ſhewn to Iſrael.</hi> — But far be any thing like this from this People.</p>
            <p>ONCE more,</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF God will think of Public Spirited Perſons for good? then how do you think he will <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them for evil that hurt and injure his People</hi>? and what a melancholly reflection does our Text lead them into, who are <hi>careleſs of doing any thing for its good</hi>?</p>
            <p>WHAT is there for God to think upon, done by too many in the places and with the talents aſſigned them? Go <hi>wicked and ſlothful Servant,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:001949_0061_0FBA440D92E05DF0"/>
carry thy Lord his Money, and tell him thou haſt hid it in the earth, but that he has his own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, tho' without uſe or improvement: but tremble to think what you will hear from him again, <hi>Take the unprofitable wretch away, and caſt him into utter darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the hurtful and injurious to his People, God will remember them to judge 'em: as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> imprecated againſt ſpiteful <hi>Tobiah</hi> &amp; falſe <hi>Sanballat,</hi> Neh. 6.14. <hi>My God think thou upon them according to their works, and on the reſt that would have put me in fear.</hi> Theſe <hi>reſt</hi> were from among themſelves, baſer to this good man than his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> foes; for there were many in <hi>Judah ſworn to Tobiah,</hi> (a thing moſt horrible to hear) and of them ſome <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly correſponded with him by Letters; Men that ſlily ſpake well of him to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and who as baſely betray'd him to <hi>Tobiah.</hi> (See <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19.) Thus they vext their <hi>good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi> trying to diſpirit him &amp; weary him out. All their tho'ts were againſt him for evil, but his God tho't upon him.</p>
            <p>IF any that hear me this day bear an ill will againſt this People, let me cordially adviſe 'em to forbear, and to fear to injure 'em; for God <hi>ſees miſchief and ſpite to requite it with his hand</hi>; he remember'd the children of <hi>Edom,</hi> their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and cruelty in the day of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And we know the times when he ſuffer'd no man to do them wrong, yea he reproved Kings for their ſake; and they that touched 'em touched the apple of his eye.</p>
