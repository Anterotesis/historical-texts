            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My dear People,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE following Dialogues were written by a worthy clergyman of our own church, and have been already made very uſeful to many perſons. In hopes that they will be made equally uſeful to <hi>you,</hi> I am encouraged to re-print them, and to put them into your hands—They contain the ſubſtance of what I have delivered to you from the pulpit, and are entirely agreeable to the doctrine of Scripture, and of the church of <hi>England,</hi> I may therefore, with great ſafety, recommend them (as I hereby do) to your ſerious and attentive peruſal. I have long had it upon my mind, that it was my bounden duty, as your miniſter to viſiſt you "from houſe to houſe," and enforce the truths of the goſpel upon you. I am now determined by the the grace of God, to ſet about this important part of my office—Let me hope my dear people will give me a favourable reception, and pay a regard to my well-meant admonitions. 'Tis impoſſible for me to addreſs every perſon, in this large and populous pariſh, ſo particularly as could be wiſhed: permit me, therefore, to convey my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the following Dialogues. They ſpeak my
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023952_0003_0FC35A4683F9A3A0"/>
whole heart upon the matter, and are ſo judiciouſly executed, that, while the moſt improved readers will find much in them both for edification and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the plaineſt and ſimpleſt capacities may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and be benefited by them. Let me then intreat your candid attention to theſe Dialogues. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whatever I would ſay to you one by one, were I to addreſs you ſingly, and are much better executed than any thing of my own upon the ſubject would be. It may not be amiſs to add that they are wrote by a father in Chriſt, one who has a pariſh of his own, and who is a faithful preacher of the goſpel of our dear Saviour. God grant you may read them in the ſame ſpirit they were wrote in! then I am perſuaded you will receive a bleſſing from the peruſal. In the name of my Maſter then, I pay you this friendly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, and intreat your acceptance of this little book. For his ſake I beſeech you ſeriouſly to conſider the truths contained therein. Thoſe of you who live without any concern for your poor ſouls, I would earneſtly call upon to attend with diligence to the "things that belong unto their peace." Theſe, and all ſuch as are contented with a bare profeſſion, and the mere externals of religion, would do well to conſider the firſt Dialogue. Thoſe of you who are ſeeking the kingdom of heaven (and I truſt I have many ſuch among you) will find ſome uſeful directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the ſecond; and the ſoul, which is juſtified by faith, will meet with very profitable inſtruction in the third. I would adviſe you, however, to give them all a ſerious reading; although I recommend it to you to fix your particular attention upon that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue that ſuits your ſtate—My dear brethren, I wiſh you knew how earneſtly I "long for your ſouls "in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt;" how ſincerely I deſire your ſalvation. An eternity is before you: Oh that I might be inſtrumental to your finding that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity a bleſſed one! With this deſire I beg leave to wait on you and preſent you with theſe Dialogues.
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:023952_0004_0FC35A48ED551E28"/>
I need no apology for taking this liberty, ſince my office allows me to take it. I would rather aſk Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for having neglected it ſo long. But, for the future, I intend, God willing, to renew my viſits once a year, while he ſhall ſpare me to "labour amongſt you." I likewiſe invite all ſuch of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh as are willing to receive any little inſtructions I can give them, the pooreſt among you I invite, to come to me whenever they chuſe, with all the freedom of a friend, and with all the confidence of a brother. My dear people, indeed I bear you on my heart. Were you my parents or my brethren, I could not love you more affectionately than I do. "I ſeek not yours but you," only glorify my bleſſed Maſter, by ſtriving in earneſt to enter into the kingdom of heaven, and I have my reward.—May the bleſſed Jeſus incline your hearts to ſeek his face here, that you may be glorified with him hereafter! This, you may be aſſured is my hearty prayer to God for you. I often remember you at the throne of grace, let me intreat <hi>your</hi> prayers for <hi>me</hi> in return. I am, with great reſpect and eſteem.</p>

            <p>DIALOGUE I. BETWEEN A <hi>Miniſter</hi> and one of his <hi>Pariſhioners.</hi>

               <p>FARMER, good-morrow. I find you have been early up, and diligently employed: Your cattle are fed, and ſervants at work. I ſee thriving in the world is a matter very near your heart.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, Sir, all this is neceſſary. Meat and cloaths muſt be provided; the lord's rent muſt be paid; and this requires much care and labour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I would by no means diſcourage your induſtry. It is your duty to be <hi>not ſlothful in buſineſs.</hi> But, you know, you have another calling beſides huſbandry: The ſoul muſt be fed and cloathed too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Doubtleſs the ſoul ought to be minded in the firſt place, for that is the chief concern: But I hope I do not neglect my ſoul and the world to come: I ſhould be ſorry you ſhould think me ſo bad a man: I believe you have no reaſon—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>No particular reaſon to be ſuſpicious of you rather than others. But when I look round, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the general unconcern about ſalvation in which men live, I am concerned for my fellow-mortals: And with reſpect to you of this pariſh in particular. I think myſelf obliged to admoniſh you of your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that you may not die before you have obtained forgiveneſs of your ſins through faith in JESUS CHRIST, and <hi>an inheritance among them that are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</hi>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Lord! Sir, why ſhould you entertain ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable thoughts of us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Do not ſo abuſe the word <hi>charity:</hi> It ſignifies the ſame as <hi>love.</hi> Now love does not require that we think well of every body with or without reaſon, but that we wiſh and intend well to every body. If I gave myſelf no trouble about you, that is, if I was utterly void of charity, you would think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> very charitable man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>But I hope you do not condemn us all: Some of us indeed are wicked, ſwearing, drunken men; but we are not all ſo. You know yourſelf that I keep my church, and come ſometimes to ſacrament. I never hurted any man in my life, and pay every man his due.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>And upon this you build your hopes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?—If this is your foundation, I muſt plainly tell you, it will leave you hopeleſs in the day of trial. Let us examine it by the word of God.</p>
               <p>"You never did any hurt to any man." You mean, I ſuppoſe, you never robbed nor murdered any perſon: I do not think you have; but ſtill you have committed much ſin, and done much hurt, not only to others, but eſpecially to your own ſoul, by great and numberleſs, nay daily offences againſt the holy law of GOD. Nay you have broken every one of his commandments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Who could give you ſuch an account of me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You yourſelf, laſt Lord's day. When you heard me repeat the commandments, you made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer after each of them, <hi>Lord, have mercy upon me,</hi> &amp;c. Your calling for mercy was plainly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelf guilty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I never committed <hi>idolatry, murder, adultery</hi>—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, all of them. Have you never loved any worldly thing more than God and his favour? not feared any thing more than his diſpleaſure, ſo as to neglect a known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rather than draw upon your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſome temporal inconvenience? This was a breach
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023952_0007_0FC35A5D4CE52D90"/>
of the <hi>firſt</hi> commandment. The <hi>ſecond</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſpects the <hi>manner of expreſſing</hi> the devotion of the heart; and therefore, whatever in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice has been unbecoming, ſuch as <hi>wandering thoughts, careleſſneſs</hi> and <hi>irreverence,</hi> as well as <hi>uſing images,</hi> is a breach of this commandment: So is alſo neglect of GOD's ſervice. And here you will not pretend, I ſuppoſe, to be <hi>not guilty.</hi> Conſequently your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to church and ſacrament in this manner deſerves rather to be reckoned among your ſins, than tuſted to for juſtification before GOD. But a few minutes ago, in my hearing, you <hi>took the Lord's name in vain,</hi> uſing it needleſly, and without an awful ſenſe, of his Majeſty, of whom you ſpake. You have done the ſame perhaps ten thouſand times in your life. This is a breach of the <hi>third</hi> commandment. Whenever you have neglected to attend on GOD's worſhip on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> without a neceſſary hindrance, ſuffered worldly thoughts to unfit you for GOD's ſervice, done worldly buſineſs on that day that might be done on another, and neglected to devote the whole to GOD, by <hi>reading, hearing, prayer, meditation</hi> and <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful converſation</hi>—you have profaned the LORD's day. The ſubſtance of theſe commandments is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD <hi>with all thy heart:</hi> But you have come ſhort of this whenever you have not acted to the glory of GOD. Now what think you of your innocence with reſpect to the duties of the firſt table?</p>

               <p>You would not ſay ſo, if you underſtood the ſpirituality and extent of GOD's commandments, as explained by our LORD in his <hi>ſermon on the mount.</hi> There you find that <hi>concupiſcence</hi> in the eye or heart is eſteemed <hi>adultery</hi> in the ſight of GOD; and cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>anger,</hi> and eſpecially injurious language, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a degree of <hi>murder:</hi> And who can acquit himſelf of theſe?</p>

                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:023952_0008_0FC35A6621E5AC60"/>If you take the ſame method to underſtand the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commandments, all parts of your behaviour that are unſuitable to the ſtation in which Providence hath placed you, all <hi>irreverence</hi> and proud cenſuring of your <hi>ſuperiors,</hi> and all unkind and injurious treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that are <hi>beneath</hi> you, will appear to be breaches of the <hi>fifth</hi> commandment.

I do not think you a thief or a robber: Yet, have you never concealed the faults and bad properties of what you ſold, when you knew that ignorance of theſe faults was the very thing that induced the perſon to buy? Nay, have you often recommended your goods in ſuch general terms, as were inconſiſtent with ſtrict truth? Have you not cruelly taken ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the neceſſity of a needy ſeller, and beat down his ware much below its real value? Theſe will certainly witneſs againſt you.</p>

from, and whoſe arm none can reſiſt or eſcape? Had you lived in <hi>Sodom,</hi> or the old world, this ſame thought might have lulled you aſleep in the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abominations, but would not ſave you from the overflowing <hi>deluge,</hi> nor the ſtreams of <hi>fire.</hi>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Friend, be ſerious. The ſubject we are now upon is of the utmoſt importance. I have ſinned as well as you; I have greatly ſinned, and my ſins have deſerved eternal damnation: But GOD hath been pleaſed to awaken me to repentance, he hath ſhewn me my danger, and ſtirred me up to <hi>flee from the wrath to come.</hi> He hath ſhewn me alſo the way of eſcaping the wages of ſin, opened in the <hi>bleſſed goſpel.</hi> The tender of ſalvation there made I truſt I have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and obtained forgiveneſs through faith in JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I hope I have repented too: I am ſure, if I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend GOD, I am ſorry for it afterwards. And for faith, why, we are all <hi>chriſtians,</hi> I hope, are we not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>If your <hi>repentance</hi> is <hi>ſincere,</hi> and your <hi>faith lively</hi> and ſaving, your ſtate is ſafe and happy. But many perſons deceive themſelves by a <hi>dead faith</hi> and <hi>imperfect repentance.</hi> Are you willing to have the ſincerity of yours tried?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I am; for the trial can do me no hurt. If I am ſafe, it is well; if I am not, I hope it is not too late to amend.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay very right. Firſt, then, let us examine your <hi>repentance.</hi> Now true repentance implies a ſenſe of ſin, its odiouſneſs and deformity, a hatred of it,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023952_0010_0FC35A6BF41BF358"/>
humilation and ſelf loathing on account of it, an actual forſaking of it, and a turning to GOD by new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life. Is your repentance ſuch as this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I hope it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> eternal death. Do you think you deſerve this death?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>As much as other men, for all are ſinners: But GOD is merciful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Do not now talk of other men. Do you <hi>A. B.</hi> think that you deſerve eternal death?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>If GOD ſhould deal with me according to ſtrict juſtice, I do: But as I think GOD is merciful, ſo I hope I ſhall do well enough.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I fear your notions of GOD'S mercy are ſuch as <hi>prevent</hi> true repentance. You ſeem to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained hopes of mercy, without being deeply ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of your utter miſery without it; to have applied the healing balſam, before you were wounded. This is what the Almighty ſtiles <hi>healing the wounds of his people ſlightly.</hi> Now you ſeem in this manner to have deceived yourſelf. You never ſaw yourſelf in a ſtate of ſin and death; you never ſaw ſin odious; you were never greatly afraid of periſhing, nor ſaw that there was no help or ſtrength in yourſelf; therefore you never fled to him that is a <hi>refuge from the ſtorm.</hi> And, if you never fled thus to CHRIST, as helpleſs and undone without him, it is plain that you are ſtill without any ſaving intereſt in him.</p>
               <p>See how it was with thoſe converts mentioned in the Acts of the Apoſtles: <hi>Peter's</hi> hearers were <hi>prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hearts, and ſaid, Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> The <hi>goaler</hi> came trembling, through a ſenſe of his miſerable condition before he was baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and received forgiveneſs of ſins. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtruck to the ground.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>All theſe were infidels, I was baptized in my infaney, and bred up to know good things, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>GOD does not deal with all exactly in the ſame way. But take heed you do not depend too much
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023952_0011_0FC35A70F2ED79C0"/>
upon theſe privileges. You were early baptized; but ſearch your heart and life. Have you not lived for a long time together as <hi>without God in the world?</hi> Inſtead of <hi>renouncing</hi> the <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>devil,</hi> have you not <hi>followed,</hi> and <hi>been led by them?</hi> Have you not been led by the world in judging of things according to the opinions of men, in oppoſition to the word of GOD? Have you not in many things conformed to its cuſtoms, contrary to the commands of GOD? Have you not frequently obeyed your <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal luſts</hi> and <hi>inclinations,</hi> ſo as to violate frequently the pure law of GOD, if not by actual offences, yet by indulging evil thoughts, and living in leſſer ſins without concern? And has not the <hi>devil</hi> been for a conſiderable time your maſter, leading you to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend GOD by profaning his holy name and holy day, and that for the ſake of ſuch a trifling pleaſure, as plainly argues his aſcendancy over you? And have you not continued ſtill in theſe things with little or no concern, hoping not withſtanding that all would be well? Nay, is not this ſtill in ſome meaſure your caſe?— I ſee you acknowledge it is. It is plain then, your baptiſmal vow and covenant is broken; and there is an abſolute neceſſity of turning unto GOD, and begining all anew.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>How muſt I begin anew?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>By acknowledging that by your departure from God you have brought yourſelf to a <hi>ſtate of ſin and miſery; alienated from</hi> GOD, inclined to evil, and therefore at <hi>enmity with</hi> GOD in your heart; that for theſe things you deſerve his wrath, and ſtand on the brink of ruin, covered with guilt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I am willing to forſake all ſin, turn to GOD, and do better. Will that do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe are good reſolutions, but they do not ſeem to proceed from a right principle. You would forſake ſin, and do better, I ſee, with ſome ſecret dependance upon your amendment and doings, that theſe will <hi>fit</hi> you for acceptance, and <hi>gain</hi> you an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in CHRIST: But this is a legal ſpirit of ſelf-dependance,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023952_0012_0FC35A720D422A40"/>
a <hi>going about to eſtabliſh your own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> When I ſee you acknowledge yourſelf <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, vile</hi> and <hi>baſe,</hi> and, like <hi>Job, abhorring yourſelf;</hi> when I ſee you ſenſible that you are <hi>unworthy</hi> of the leaſt mercy, and <hi>unable</hi> of yourſelf to do any good thing; when I ſee you <hi>renouncing</hi> your beſt deeds as defiled by ſin, caſting yourſelf before GOD as <hi>loſt</hi> and <hi>helpleſs,</hi> having no hope in yourſelf, but ſupported only by the promiſe of ſalvation made in JESUS CHRIST; when this is not only the language of the tongue, but theſe convictions are deeply impeſſed on the heart—When this is your caſe, I ſhall think a real work of grace is begun in your ſoul.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Why, this is adviſing me to <hi>deſpair!</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed I would have you deſpair of all help from yourſelf, or on account of any thing you have done, or can do; for till then you will not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly value JESUS CHRIST, nor fly to him as your only Saviour, who <hi>came to preach deliverance to the captives,</hi> and to <hi>bind up the broken-hearted.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I believe all this may be neceſſary for a <hi>notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinner,</hi> or an <hi>heathen;</hi> but I have lived in ſome fear of GOD, kept my church, and always believed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt you never believed at all, properly ſpeaking: But of this I will talk more with you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time. At preſent, it is plain, your <hi>repentance</hi> has not been <hi>real.</hi> You never ſaw and felt your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, conſequently could never be ſo deſirous of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as is neceſſary. You always flattered your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome hopes that your ſtate was ſafe, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would be, when you lived a little better; which was at bottom depending on yourſelf, with reſpect to the branches of repentance, ſuch as <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking ſin</hi>—it is evident to yourſelf you have lived without concern in ſome leſſer habitual ſins ; and, as for <hi>turning to</hi> GOD, you were never ſenſible, that in the <hi>ſtream of your affections</hi> and <hi>the general courſe of your life,</hi> you were turned from him.</p>
               <p>Indeed (though you ſeem not to know it) the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling principle in you, and every <hi>natural man,</hi> is a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023952_0013_0FC35A7375413D60"/>
principle of ſin and corruption. Inſtead of ſeeking to pleaſe GOD, you have all along been ſeeking to pleaſe yourſelf; to procure ſome gratification to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature, ſuch as ſenſual delights, riches, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem, eaſe, or the like. This hath been the acting principle throughout your whole conduct, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of obeying that command, <hi>do all to the glory of GOD.</hi> Nay, if you ſearch narrowly, you will find in your heart an <hi>enmity againſt GOD.</hi> For ſo ſaith the apoſtle, Rom. viii. 7. <hi>The carnal mind</hi> (and ſuch is every man's by nature) is <hi>enmity againſt GOD.</hi> And this <hi>enmity</hi> ſhews itſelf in oppoſing GOD's will, by doing what he hath forbidden, and leaving undone what he hath commanded; and alſo in flying from GOD as your enemy, and endeavouring to hide your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from him like <hi>Adam.</hi> Have you not paſſed days and weeks without one ſerious thought of GOD, though you were all that time receiving mercies at his hand? Have you not baniſhed and ſuppreſſed ſuch thoughts, when they have riſen in your mind? Have you not fled from ſerious thoughts of GOD and eternity, as enemies to your peace, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in worldly cares, vain converſation, and idle amuſements? Have you not thus fled from GOD, You know you have.—Hitherto, ſuffer me to be plain with you, you have gone wrong, and have been inſenſible of your danger, deceived yourſelf, and <hi>ſpoken peace</hi> to your ſoul, <hi>when there was no peace.</hi> Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you have heard from me, read your Bible, examine yourſelf, and pray unto GOD to give you a ſenſe of your real ſtate, and a right judgement in all things.</p>

               <p>Your yeſterday's ſermon about the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have been very uneaſy ever ſince I heard it. For I am greatly afraid, that, if the day of judgment was now to come, it would find me unprepared. And then—the LORD have mercy upon my poor ſoul!</p>

day, who had fled to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, for righteouſneſs to juſtify them, and had been made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Spirit of GOD, creating in them a <hi>new heart,</hi> and had evidenced this change by an holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the remaining part of their life, how many or great ſoever their ſins had been: And that the <hi>wicked</hi> were thoſe that had lived and died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith in CHRIST, and the indwelling of GOD's Spirit, however orderly and decent their conduct was.</p>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, that was it that terriffed <hi>me.</hi> You told us that the moſt upright man had committed ſins enough to condemn him, if he died without an intereſt in CHRIST, and without being accepted as righteous through <hi>him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if this mercy and acceptance through JESUS CHRIST, were obtained before death, no man's ſins would be remembered againſt him in that day. And to prove this, you ſhewed us, that in the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the laſt day, as related by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> no ſins of the righteous are mentioned by the Judge, nor any good deeds of the wicked.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>The <hi>wicked,</hi> that is, they that lived and died without an humbling ſenſe of their natural corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and actual ſins, ſo as never by faith to fly for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to GOD's mercy in CHRIST, have, properly ſpeaking, no good works to be mentioned, for all they do is from a wrong principle; either for ſelfiſh or worldly ends, or in order to be accepted on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their <hi>doings;</hi> which is ſeeking ſalvation <hi>by the law of works.</hi> On this account their works are not regarded, being not <hi>done in faith;</hi> that is, not proceeding from an union with CHRIST by faith, <hi>without whom we can do nothing</hi> acceptable in GOD's ſight. <hi>John</hi> xv. 5. On the other hand, the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> being themſelves accepted through CHRIST, their ſins are not mentioned, becauſe long before <hi>forgiven</hi> and <hi>blotted out:</hi> And their <hi>imperfect ſervices</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted through JESUS their <hi>High-prieſt,</hi> who <hi>bears

the iniquity of their holy things,</hi> receive at the hands of their bountiful <hi>Judge</hi> a reward of grace. So that which <hi>principally</hi> diſtinguiſhes the <hi>godly</hi> from the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> is, that the one is accepted as righteous, and has obtained forgiveneſs through CHRIST, according to the new or goſpel covenant: The other, never being deeply ſenſible of his ſinful loſt ſtate (indeed too proud to acknowledge it) hath not applied for the mercy repreſented in the goſpel, and ſo at the day of judgment ſtands on his own bottom, without a mediator, and without forgiveneſs, and therefore muſt be condemned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>But then why are works mentioned at all on that day, as we find they are?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I gave you two reaſons for this. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe though they are not the ground of man's acceptance, yet they ſhew a man to be in a juſtified ſtate; for we cannot <hi>bear</hi> the fruit of holineſs, unleſs we are <hi>in</hi> and <hi>abide in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>John</hi> xv. 4. And they that do not act righteouſly deceive themſelves, if they think themſelves righteous; ſo that good works ſerve to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh <hi>believers</hi> from <hi>unbelievers. Secondly,</hi> Becauſe the different degrees of fruitfulneſs make a difference between the godly themſelves, ſo that GOD is pleaſed graciouſly to confer upon them different degrees of glory. That any man is at all ſaved is owing to his faith in the <hi>Redeemer:</hi> His degree of glory is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to his fruitfulneſs and diligence in the vinyard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I always thought that we <hi>chriſtians</hi> were all <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> one as much as another: And that at the day of judgment they would be reckoned <hi>godly</hi> that lived <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>uprightly,</hi> among whom I reckoned myſelf and all were better than I; and that the <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> and all that were <hi>ſecretly wicked</hi> and <hi>ill-deſigned,</hi> would be condemned. Indeed I had always ſome fears that I was not <hi>good enough:</hi> I did not know how great a number would be acknowledged righteous; but I thought I ſtood a better chance than many, or moſt that I knew.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I ſee that all depends on my obtaining, whilſt on earth, mercy and forgiveneſs of all that is paſt; and that not on account of any thing done by me, but through faith in JESUS CHRIST. But what that faith is I know not: This I know, that I have been all along out of the way.</p>

               <p>In order to determine that, look into your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There this tender of ſalvation is made: <hi>CHRIST JESUS came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. i. 15. Now what think you? Are you of the number he came to ſave, or not?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That is becauſe they <hi>will not come to him,</hi> to be ſaved. Of this he complains, <hi>John</hi> v. 40. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</hi>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I have been for ſome time ſo as I was never in my life before: I have been afraid I ſhould be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This has filled me with thought and fears day and night. You had no need to caution me againſt the danger of worldly cares and pleaſures: For where-ever I was, or what ever I have been doing, my ſins and hell have been before my eyes.</p>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Sins committed many years ago have now riſen in my mind, and condemned me. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023952_0022_0FC35ACA6F6F7A78"/>
of the ſins of my youth has followed me, as if committed but yeſterday. And ſome hard ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that I have heard and read, ſeem to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of <hi>my</hi> condemnation. I believe I have thought an hundred times of thoſe words: <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Have you been looking into your heart, and ſeen and lamented the corruptions there?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>I did not uſe to underſtand what you meant by <hi>looking into the heart;</hi> but I think I do now. I find in myſelf a ſtrong inclination to many ſins, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that I am convinced in my mind that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve God's wrath on account of complying with theſe inclinations heretofore. Indeed it is much better with me now than it was. Formerly I have been led by my own wicked heart to delight in idle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; to talk of myſelf in an empty vain manner; to be greedy after the world; to paſs ſlightly over, or entirely neglect prayer, and other duties, as a tedious burthen; and to be guilty of other ſins. At preſent I bleſs God, it is not ſo; but all my thoughts are, in a manner taken up about the care of my ſoul, and the world to come.</p>

               <p>I fear, you do not know your heart as well as you imagine. You ſeem to think that <hi>all things are</hi> already <hi>become new</hi> in you. But be not deceived: Such a cage of unclean birds, as the heart of every man is by nature, is not ſo ſoon cleanſed from its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious luſts and vile affections. Theſe that ſeem to be rooted out are only aſleep for a ſeaſon: Be watchful therefore; they will one day awake again. Some of them probably are only exchanged for others as bad and dangerous, ſuch as <hi>pride, preſumption,</hi> and the like.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Really, Sir, I have had ſome fear of that. For you muſt know that one day I was thinking what a ſinful wretch I was, and what would become of me in the next world; when theſe words came ſtrongly into my mind; <hi>I will heal their backſlidings, I will love
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023952_0023_0FC35AD885AA39D0"/>
them freely.</hi> I am ſure they are ſomewhere in the Bible, but I cannot find them. However, they gave me much comfort, and I have been very eaſy ever ſince. Now a neighbour that I have been talking with, tells me, "This is to be looked on as a word from God," and that I am from henceforth to look on myſelf as a converted man. But I fear this would be preſumption. Now what do you think of this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt deſire ſome time to reſolve this queſtion: ſeven years, at leaſt, before I can give a poſitive anſwer to it.</p>
               <p>The words you mentioned are in the prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea,</hi> xiv. 4. They were perhaps ſpoken more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of the reſtoration of the captive <hi>Jews:</hi> But they contain a ſweet promiſe perfectly in the goſpel ſtrain, and are therefore free for every hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoul to embrace by faith. The prophet you ſee at verſe 1, 2, 3, exhorts the people to repentance and humiliation for ſin: <hi>O Iſrael, return unto the LORD thy GOD; for thou haſt fallen by iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the LORD. Say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly.— For in thee the fatherleſs findeth mercy.</hi> Now, as God hath given you a ſenſe of your ſinful, helpleſs ſtate, and a deſire of turning to him, like this which the prophet here deſcribes as preparatory to an anſwer of peace. I hope the following promiſe belongs to you: <hi>I will heal their backſliding, I will love them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for my anger is turned away from him,</hi> verſe 4. I hope too, that comfort, which you found in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſe to yourſelf by a particular faith, proceedeth from the Spirit of God. In the ſame manner as I look on that conviction of ſin, which filled you with fear and ſelf-abaſement, when you called to mind your ſinfulneſs and God's judgment denounced againſt ſinners, to be the work of the ſame Spirit. For it is he that <hi>convinceth the world of ſin and of righteouſneſs.</hi> But this I muſt tell you: All theſe feelings are to be ſuſpected, till we ſee what
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023952_0024_0FC35ADCB26AA590"/>
fruit follows in the heart and life. For though, theſe are ſometimes owing to the Spirit of God, and come well recommended, when, as in your caſe, they are ſo cloſely connected with the word of God; yet <hi>the enemy of ſouls</hi> ſometimes imitates theſe ſenſible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences in order to deceive. And it is impoſſible to ſay how much our natural temper and ſpirit may contribute thereto.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Pray, Sir, tell me plainly what you think of my ſtate.</p>

                  <hi>Satan,</hi> I tell you, ſometimes puts on <hi>the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of an angel of light,</hi> in order to deceive. Thoſe ſenſible experiences ſometimes vouchſafed by the Spirit of God, and impreſſions made on mens minds, of which ſort are what the ſcripture terms <hi>peace in believing</hi> and <hi>joy in the Holy Ghoſt</hi>—theſe the <hi>enemy</hi> ſometimes imitates, and thereby deludes hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites into ſpiritual pride, and even the godly ſome times, ſo as to <hi>puff</hi> them <hi>up,</hi> and make them ſecure and careleſs. But there are two tokens of grace, which the devil will not, cannot effect: Theſe are an holy heart, ſteadily hating ſin; and an holy life, having reſpect to all God's commandments. Have theſe, and evidence the one by the other; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ſome conſiderable time thus to adorn your profeſſion—Then I ſhall not have the leaſt doubt but you are in a ſtate of grace.</p>

               <p>As far as I know my own heart, I would not willingly offend God for the whole world.

               <p>
                  <hi>Strive to make your calling and election ſure</hi> and evident both to yourſelf and others, by <hi>bringing forth the fruit of righteouſneſs in a good converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My firſt advice is, <hi>Be humble,</hi> and <hi>walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Let the remembrance of your paſt life of ſin and folly ſtill cover you with ſhame. Recollect the many aggravating circumſtances of a life hitherto ſpent in rebellion againſt God: During all which he daily heaped mercies upon you and yours; giving food and raiment, health and ſtrength; and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe mercies to you, while you forgot the hand that gave them, and returned evil for good. He <hi>ſpared</hi> you in all your provocations; and at laſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your eyes to ſee your danger, ſtirred you up to avoid it, and now hath given you a good hope through grace of obtaining eternal life. Thus compare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether what God has done and you deſerved, and thus learn <hi>humility.</hi> Keep a watchful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> alſo upon the remains of indwelling ſin ſtill in you. And let every ſinful inclination, vain thought, backwardneſs to duty, and failure in it, teach you to be humble and fear. Thus, diſtruſting yourſelf, look up to God for continual ſupport, like an helpleſs little child; expecting, through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, to be aſſiſted in every time of need.</p>
               <p>My next advice is, Keep <hi>a conſcience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> If you have wronged any man, be not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to acknowledge it; and according to your power make reſtitution: That the accurſed thing may not cleave unto you. Take heed that you <hi>grieve not the Spirit</hi> of God by unholy walking, left you <hi>provoke him to forſake you.</hi> To this end, watch over your
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023952_0026_0FC35AEED1999D80"/>
heart, repreſs its firſt inclinations to ſin, and be watchful againſt temptations from without; fixing your eye eſpecially on the ſins with which you have heretofore been <hi>moſt eaſily beſet.</hi> If at any time ſin prevail againſt you, do not endeavour to forget it, or <hi>hide it in your boſom:</hi> But go to God immediately; take ſhame to yourſelf: plead the goſpel promiſes to returning ſinners, looking unto Jeſus Chriſt as your all-ſufficient ſacrifice, and <hi>advocate with the Father;</hi> and never ceaſe wreſtling with God in Prayer, until he again ſpeak peace to your troubled ſoul, and fill you with a greater fear of offending him.</p>
               <p>As I hope you are now planted in God's vineyard, <hi>Be fruitful.</hi> Bear on your heart a ſenſe of God's love to ſinners in Jeſus Chriſt. Conſider in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, what God hath done for you, in <hi>calling you out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> Remember how you lay faſt aſleep in ſin and fatal ſecurity, when God awaked you to ſee your danger and eſcape it. Think what would have been your condition in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if God had leſt you to yourſelf. Think how many ſtill go on in the ſame fatal path in which you trod. And let the ſenſe of God's diſtinguiſhing love to you excite you to ſome return. <hi>Love him, becauſe he firſt loved you.</hi> And let love to your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther influence your <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let your <hi>meditations</hi> of God be ſweet and frequent. Lift up your heart to him <hi>that ſeeth in ſecret, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart and reins.</hi> Seek a cloſe communion with the <hi>Father of your ſpirit:</hi> And to this end, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to withdraw your thoughts from worldly things, and to raiſe your affections from earth to heaven, to thoſe things, which are not ſeen but by the eyes of faith. That thus you may <hi>walk by faith,</hi> guided by it as the eye of the ſoul, and raiſed by it to <hi>heavenly-mindedneſs;</hi> ſo as to love and delight in God.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of your former vain <hi>converſation,</hi> hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth let your tongue be employed to God's glory; in <hi>ſpeaking good of his name;</hi> in prayer and praiſe
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023952_0027_0FC35AF008D01E68"/>
to your great Benefactor; in telling others <hi>what he hath done for your ſoul;</hi> in warning ſinners of their danger, and encouraging them that fear God to be bold and hearty in his ſervice.</p>
               <p>And let your <hi>conduct in life</hi> be ſuch as becometh the goſpel. You are called to <hi>fight the good fight of faith;</hi> ſee that you <hi>faint not,</hi> neither be <hi>weary in well doing.</hi> Shew that you are <hi>alive unto GOD by living unto GOD,</hi> by devoting yourſelf to his ſervice, and by diligence therein. Do ſomething for him that hath done ſo much for you. Be loving unto all men, for they are the work of God's hands: Do good unto all men according to your ability. Your time and ſtrength, and every other talent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are given you to be improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, lay them out in acts of charity and love.

               <p>Shew a particular regard for <hi>them that are of the houſhold of faith,</hi> all the ſincerely godly, for Chriſt's ſake.

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023952_0028_0FC35AF18F1FA0B8"/>
blood, and ſanctified by his Spirit. And to animate you to greater diligence in this work and labour of love, view often with the eyes of faith the glorious reward ſet before you, the eternal weight of glory to be beſtowed on that day when Chriſt ſhall reward acts of mercy and love, done in his name as if done to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Quickened by this principle, and encouraged by this proſpect, ſtrive to grow in knowledge, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and faith, and love, and godly fear; in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and every chriſtian grace. Study to promote God's glory, the welfare of all men, and ſuch a diſpoſition in your own ſoul, as may render you <hi>meet to be a partaker of the inheritance of the ſaints in light.</hi> And, in order to promote this work of ſanctification in you, wait for God's bleſſing and grace in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious uſe of the ordinances, in prayer public and private, hearing and reading God's word; and confirm your covenant with God at his table. Thus may you hope to be a fruitful vine, and experience in your ſoul thoſe bleſſings, which the prophet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately adds to that promiſe of free mercy, in which you have found ſo much conſolation. <hi>Hoſea</hi> xiv. 5, 6, 7. <hi>I will be as the dew unto Iſrael.
