            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

HISTORY OF THE YELLOW FEVER.</head>
         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <argument>
               <p>Sketch of the ſituation of Philadelphia—State of the city—Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the weather and diſeaſes of man and other animals previous to the appearance of the Yellow Fever, in 1798.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>PHILADELPHIA, the metropolis of the United States of America, is ſituated in 39 degrees 56 minutes of North latitude, and 75 degrees 9 minutes of longitude, Weſt from London; is upon the Weſt bank of the river Delaware, and about 120 miles, by the courſe of the river, from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic Ocean, and is 6 miles above the junction of the Schuylkill with the Delaware.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to its original plan, it extends from the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, which is on the Eaſt, to the Schuylkill, on the Weſt, making a plot of about two miles in length, and about one mile in breadth, North and South. The ground is level, and generally moiſt; its medium height, above the level of the two waters, is thirty-four to forty feet.—The principal part of the ſurrounding country is level, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally cleared of woods, and under cultivation: a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portion of that between the city and confluence of the rivers, commonly called the Neck, is meadow ground, low
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035335_0005_100231A09CEC5BA0"/>
and conſequently moiſt; in the vicinity of the rivers, it is frequently overflowed, and ſubjects the inhabitants to <hi>fever-and-ague.</hi> But, towards the North and North-Weſt, the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation is much higher. The river Delaware, oppoſite the city, is about one mile broad; the tide riſes ſix feet perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and flows at the rate of four miles an hour; its oppoſite ſhore, in the ſtate of Jerſey, is level; the ſoil dry and ſandy.</p>
            <p>The buildings do not at preſent extend over half the ground deſignated in the original plan; as the inhabitants, from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious commercial advantages, have preferred the Delaware front rather than the Schuylkill: hence, at preſent, the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes extend nearly three miles North and South along the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware, and about three-quarters of a mile due Weſt toward the Schuylkill. They are chiefly built with bricks, from two to five ſtories high; the ſtreets are regular, wide and airy, except Water-ſtreet, which occupies the ſpace between the bank upon which Front-ſtreet is built, and the river, which was originally deſigned for ſtores. It is the narroweſt, yet one of the moſt populous in the city: the ſtreet is only thirty feet wide, and but a little above the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the tide: the houſes are high, and the greater part of them have no yards, particularly thoſe ſituated on the Weſt or bank ſide; an inconvenience which tends much to render the ſtreet more nauſeous. It is much confined, ill-aired, and, in every reſpect, is a diſagreeable ſtreet. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral alleys in the city, which are alſo narrow, confined and filthy.</p>
            <p>The river, for nearly the whole extent of the city, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented with forced wharves, made, as is uſual, of ſquare caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with logs, and filled with earth, veſſels-ballaſt, ſtones, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Where Dock-ſtreet is now built, in former years, was a ſwamp or canal, with a ſmall ſtream of water running through it, extending from the river to Third-ſtreet, which became a general nuiſance, and a common reſervoir for the filth of a large part of the city. It now forms a handſome, airy, ſerpentine ſtreet, having an arch underneath, covered with earth, and paved. This concave ſewer begins beyond Sixth-ſtreet, in Potter's-Field, and is carried under ground below the jail to Walnut-ſtreet, and down Walnut ſtreet to Dock-ſtreet, between Second and Third-ſtreets, and from thence down Dock-ſtreet to the river. At neceſſary diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there are apertures left to receive the water from the gutters of the adjacent ſtreets: theſe openings, in the intenſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035335_0006_100231A2EA4BCA10"/>
heat of ſummer, emit a very diſagreeable ſtench. There are ſeveral ſinks dug, to receive the water from the gutters, in thoſe parts of the city, where there is no other declivity to carry it off. Two of theſe, which are the moſt remarkable, are ſituated in Market-ſtreet, at the corner of Fourth-ſtreet. They, like the apertures to the Dock-ſtreet ſewer, exhale the moſt noxious effluvia; for, dead animals and every kind of nauſea, are thrown into them, and there remain till they become putrified. During the ſickneſs in ſummer 1797, Dr. Paſcalis mentions, that being frequently called out dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the night, he could ſtrongly perceive the ſmell iſſuing from theſe ſinks in Market-ſtreet as far as Mulberry-ſtreet on the one ſide, and Cheſnut-ſtreet on the other.</p>
            <p>A few years ago, there were numbers of marſhes and ponds of ſtagnant water, in the out-lots of the city, which periodically ſubjected the inhabitants ſurrounding them to fever-and-ague. Theſe public nuiſances are now either drained, filled up, or built upon; ſince which, but few are troubled with this complaint. There are, ſtill, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in Southwark and the Northern Liberties: there are alſo many vacancies on the bank of the river, which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a thick bed of miery filth; the wharves, likewiſe, at times, become filled up with impure ſubſtances from the adjoining ſtreets; and, during the ſummer, emit, at low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a very offenſive ſmell. A ſmall ſtream of water, called Pegg's Run, paſſes through Spring-Garden and the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Liberties, the bottom of which is wide and miery; its banks are unimproved, and rendered offenſive by the offals which are thrown upon them from the ſlaughter-houſes, tan-yards, &amp;c. adjoining. Beyond this, upon the Delaware, the improvements called Kenſington, are ſituated. A great part of which, at high water, is nearly ſurrounded by the tide, which, when low, leaves a broad, muddy marſh, more than a quarter of a mile round its ſouth and weſt parts.—Upon this, the heat in ſummer, as might be expected, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſimilar effects. One other ſource of putrid animal exhalation, which very forcibly attracts the notice of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, is moſt ſenſibly diſcovered in thickly inhabited places during the ſummer months. Moſt every dwelling of the city has a privy-houſe, ſituated generally at the fartheſt end of the yard; but the houſes on the bank ſide of Front-ſtreet, have them in their cellars: many of the ſinks, over which they ſtand, are dug to the depth of between twenty to thirty feet, and built round with bricks: They are not
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035335_0007_100231A4822E1B00"/>
cleaned till nearly full, which is once in ten or twelve years, and then, in many caſes, it is conſidered eaſier to cover them over, and dig others. After many years fermentation, theſe ſinks exhale a very putrid and offenſive effluvia, which is abundantly emitted when the air is moiſt, calm or ſultry, particularly towards the end of ſummer, or after the action of ſevere heat has excited the putrefactive fermentation.—The inhabitants are ſtill ſo well appriſed of its conſequence, and knowing that the depth of their wells is not a ſufficient preventative againſt this offenſive exhalation, that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally provide their neceſſaries with an air-pipe, riſing a few feet from the top; but ſtill, under particular circumſtances of the atmoſphere, the aſcending effluvia is frequently diffuſed round the houſes, alleys, &amp;c. where it is highly nauſeous. Some idea of the noxious quality of this gas may be formed from the effects which it produces upon combuſtion. If a lighted candle is let down one of theſe ſinks, it will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>There are many grave yards in the city, and perhaps ſome other ſources of putrid exhalation, which are in a manner incident to all large cities. It is not ſupplied with running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or fountains; but with pump-wells, in diſtributive num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, through the city and ſuburbs; many of which, perhaps, from a communication with the adjacent neceſſaries, have already become unfit even to waſh the houſes.</p>
            <p>The foregoing deſcription is chiefly confined to thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which are more particularly connecte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with the object of our undertaking; for, notwithſtanding theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, ſtill there are few cities that can vie with Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia in point of elegance or even cleanlineſs: the ſtreets interſect each other at right angles, and are open to the winds from all points; which, together with their width, regular pavement, conveniency of foot-ways, and the practice of the inhabitants of frequently waſhing the outſides of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, give to the city a ſingular appearance of regularity and neatneſs, highly admired by foreigners.</p>
            <p>The City and Liberties are eſtimated to contain about ten thouſand houſes, and the number of inhabitants is not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated when we eſtimate the total between fifty-five and ſixty thouſand ſouls. But, notwithſtanding this increaſe of population, the proſperity of the city has not equalled that of former years. The European wars, at an early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, produced conſiderable changes on the trade, property and neceſſaries of life in Philadelphia. The firſt influx of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035335_0008_100231A797861070"/>
foreigners from Europe and the Weſt-Indies raiſed the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, houſe-rents, &amp;c. and gave to the city, in general, a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing appearance; property roſe above its accuſtomed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. But the ſame cauſe has, of late years, been productive of very different effects; and our once flouriſhing trade has ſuffered very conſiderable diminution: Citizens over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their capitals, the general failure of land ſpeculation, the depredations committed upon our commerce, together with the general ſtagnation of trade in almoſt every depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has of late been followed by an increaſed number of bankrupt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>es, that at leaſt equal any period ſince the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such a combination of untoward circumſtances could hardly fail of producing numberleſs diſtreſſes. But evils of a more ſerious nature followed: That malignant ſcourge of mankind, the Yellow Fever, again appeared in the city, marking its path with unprecedented horror and devaſtation. Scarcely recovered from the baleful effects which it produced, laſt year, in the months of Auguſt, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember and October, which diſperſed more than two-thirds of the inhabitants; cut off near thirteen hundred of thoſe that remained, and added to the already general diſtreſs a number of helpleſs widows and orphans, formerly in afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but then reduced to want and poverty, in a ſevere and inclement winter, Philadelphia was this year again doomed to experience a repetition of theſe baneful conſequences, in a degree far beyond any former period, when mediocrity of circumſtances enabled citizens, by a timely flight, to eſcape from a premature Death. Before, however, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the detail of theſe melancholy events, we ſhall ſtate a few primary obſervations on the ſtate of the weather and the antecedent diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Our climate is ſuppoſed, within the few laſt years, to have undergone very conſiderable changes: the winters are expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced to be leſs cold, and the ſummers leſs warm than they were 40 or 50 years ago. It is alſo ſaid, that the climate has become more favourable to the generation of epidemic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, particularly fevers of the bilious type; and that the late recurrence of the Yellow Fever, is, in part, to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to this cauſe. The Academy of Medicine, in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, laſt year, upon the origin of this peſtilence, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the Governor of Pennſylvania, mention, that "at preſent a conſtitution of the atmoſphere prevails in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, which diſpoſes to fevers of a highly inflammatory
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035335_0009_100231AB74367868"/>
character, and that it began in the year 1793."<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Ruth's works, vol. 4, P. 47.</note> The want of meteorological obſervations during former years, renders it difficult to decide upon the firſt opinion; but, there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that the changes obſerved in the temperature of the atmoſphere are not ſo conſiderable as is imagined: The cutting down of woods and the partial cultivation of the ſoil may have ſomewhat contributed more to equalize it.—But we do not diſcover that the change produced, even in conſequence of cultivation, is in any reſpect equal to what has been produced from the ſame cauſe in other countries. Hiſtory informs us "that when Germany and Scythia aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in foreſts, the Romans often tranſported their armies acroſs the frozen Danube; but, ſince the cultivation of theſe regions, the Danube rarely freezes." Nor have we reaſon to believe that the climate is, in any degree, more favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the generation of bilious or epidemic diſeaſes; for, if it is gradually becoming more temperate and equal, and a great proportion of the ſtagnant marſhes in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the cities are drained and cultivated, the cauſe, which produced theſe diſeaſes are, of courſe, every day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, and the climate becoming more healthy than in former years.</p>
            <p>There are but few climates more changeable or irregular than that of Pennſylvania; ſcarcely two ſucceſſive years, or even days, are alike.</p>
            <p>The heat in ſummer and the cold in winter are intenſe. The mercury, in Fahrenheit's thermometer, has been known to riſe to 96° in ſummer, and to fall 5° below 0 in winter. There is not, however, more than one month in ſummer or winter in which the mercury riſes above 80° in the one, or falls below 30° in the other. The barometer is but little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the changes of the atmoſphere in this climate; its medium height is 30 inches. The warmeſt weather is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally about the end of July and beginning of Auguſt; altho' intenſely warm days are frequently felt in May, June and September. "The warmeſt part of the day in ſummer is at two, in ordinary, and at three o'clock in the afternoon in extremely warm weather. From theſe hours, the heat gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually diminiſhes till the enſuing morning. The cooleſt part of the four-and-twenty hours is at the break of day. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the warmeſt days, the evenings are generally agreeable, and often delightful. The higher the mercury riſes in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035335_0010_100231AD1EF2F940"/>
day time, the lower it falls the ſucceeding night. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury at 80° generally falls to 68° while it deſcends, when at 60° only to 56°. This diſproportion between the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the day and night in ſummer, is always greateſt in the month of Auguſt. The dews at this time are heavy in proportion to the coolneſs of the evening; they are ſometimes ſo conſiderable as to wet the clothes." It is ſeldom that two or three ſucceſſive warm days occur without being ſucceeded with ſhowers of rain, accompanied ſometimes by thunder and lightning, and afterwards by a North-Weſt wind, which produces a coolneſs in the air, that is highly invigorating and agreeable. The tranſitions from heat to cold are often ſudden and conſiderable. After a day in which the mercury has ſtood at 86° and even 90°, it ſometimes falls in the courſe of a ſingle night to the 65th, and even the 60th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. The froſt generally begins to ſhow itſelf about the end of October or beginning of November; but the intenſe cold ſeldom ſets in till about the middle of December, and the coldeſt weather is commonly in January. The mean temperature of the air in Philadelphia during the whole year is 52½°, which is the temperature of the deepeſt wells, and of common ſpring water. The wind in winter generally blows from the N. W. in fair, and from the N. E. in wet weather. The N. W. winds are uncommonly cold and dry. S. W. and W. N. W. winds generally prevail during the dry warm weather in ſummer, while the wind from N. E. is frequently accompanied by rain. Thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are leſs frequent than in former years.</p>
            <p>To the preceding obſervations, we may add that May and June are uſually the healthieſt months in the year. The exceſſive heat in ſummer has frequently been known to prove fatal to perſons who are much expoſed to it. Its mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid effects diſcover themſelves by a difficulty in breathing, a general languor, and, in ſome inſtances, by a numbneſs and an immobility of the extremities. The exceſſive cold like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proves fatal to many, particularly old perſons. The night air is always unwholeſome in the ſummer and fall months, particularly during the ſtate of ſleep. The frequent and ſudden changes of the air from heat to cold, renders it unſafe at any time to ſleep with open windows.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding what has been ſaid of the variable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the climate of Pennſylvania, it does not neceſſarily reſult that it is unhealthy; perhaps no climate is unhealthy
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035335_0011_100231AF7250B108"/>
where the inhabitants acquire, from experience, the arts of accommodating themſelves to it.</p>
            <p>We are indebted to Dr. Ruſh's ingenious and elaborate eſſay, upon the climate of Pennſylvania, for many of the above general remarks. In addition to which, we are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make a few obſervations upon the ſtate of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther previous to the laſt appearance of the yellow fever; for, an opinion prevails with many, that it and other peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential diſeaſes in general, are connected with a particular ſtate of atmoſphere, and may be prognoſticated prior to their appearance. A ſimilarity obſerved to exiſt between the conſtitution of man and many of the domeſtic ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, has alſo led ſome to ſuppoſe that certain peſtilential fluids, acting upon the ſyſtem, produce particular and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſimilar effects upon both. They likewiſe trace a ſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity between animal life and vegetation, from having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the ſeaſons in which mortal ſickneſs has prevailed among men and animals, has alſo proved unfavourable to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables.</p>
            <p>Spring ſet in this year with very promiſing appearances; the ice broke up early, and it being followed by plentiful rains, ſoon diſſolved. Vegetation commenced: but this premature aſpect was not of long duration. It was ſucceeded by cold weather, North-Weſt winds, frequent ſhowers of hail and ſlight froſts in the night, which were diſſolved by the heat of the ſun on the ſucceeding day. During the whole ſpring, the ſudden changes of the weather, from heat to cold, were more frequent and extreme than have been known for many years paſt. Even after the ſeaſon was ſo far advanced that the fruit-trees had put forth their bloſſoms, there was a ſmart ſhower of hail. A few days preceding it, the weather was warm and ſultry, inaſmuch, that many perſons put off their winter cloathing, and afterwards caught cold by the ſudden change of weather. The flower buds, bloſſoms, and young fruit, in many places, received conſiderable injury.—During the months of May and June, white froſt, more than once, occurred; and, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, in the afternoon of the 14th July, there was a ſhower of hail, and upon the morning of the 19th, there was a ſlight froſt.</p>
            <p>The weather, during the months of July and Auguſt, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits particular attention; for, if a ſtate of atmoſphere favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the generation of the Yellow Fever ever prevails, it muſt be during thoſe months; as the firſt caſes occurred in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035335_0012_100231B1C57B80E0"/>
July; and, towards the end of Auguſt, it was general over the whole city. In the years 1793 and 1797, as well as this year, the fever made its appearance nearly about the ſame period, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the end of July and beginning of Auguſt, although, by comparing the meteorological regiſters for each of thoſe years, we do not find that the weather during this period has been in any two years alike.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Journal of the ſtate of the weather, annexed hereto.</note> The month of July, this year, commenced with remarkable hot weather. The middle of the month was cold, and the weather in the end, like the beginning, was warm. On the 2d, 3d, 27th, 28th and 29th days, Fahrenheit's thermometer, in the ſhade, ſtood from 88 to 92½ degrees, and in many places it ſtood at 95° and even at 96°. A number of other phaenomena have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred this year, which attracted the attention of the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſerver; and, as theſe appearances are ſuppoſed, by many, to be connected with that ſtate of weather, which they ſuppoſe produces the diſeaſe, it may be proper to notice them. Thunder and lightning appeared earlier this year, and leſs frequent than uſual. The middle of ſpring and of ſummer was remarkably dry: the graſs meadows produced but a ſcanty crop of hay and, towards the end of ſummer, whole fields of graſs were, in many places, entirely withered up. Many tribes of inſects were uncommonly nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; as muſquitoes, ants, crickets, cockroaches, &amp;c. The graſshoppers were ſcarcely ever known to appear in ſuch vaſt quantities. In the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, they ate up all the graſs, even to the roots, ſcarcely any kind of herbage eſcaped them; whole fields of cabbage and potatoes were almoſt entirely devoured. They were ſucceeded by myriads of black crickets; the different ſpecies of caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were alſo uncommonly numerous this ſeaſon; the trees, in many places, loſt their foliage by them; but in September they put forth a ſecond crop of leaves. Inſtances have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe occurred of fruit-trees bloſſoming a ſecond time, and producing fruit late in the fall. The different claſſes of muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms were found in great abundance during their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Purſlane, during the dry hot weather, continued to grow without putting forth leaves, while the jamiſon weed flouriſhed luxuriantly. The crop of apples was greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by worms; this was ſo general all over the country that the cyder this year is tainted with their acrid taſte. Theſe, and other ſimilar phaenomena, have occurred in former years
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035335_0013_1001FE8EC3040C88"/>
when this diſorder was unknown, without attracting any particular notice; but, ſince the appearance of it in the United States, every uncommon occurrence in nature has been obſerved with an anxious wiſh to diſcover in it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the cauſe of this fatal evil.</p>
            <p>A ſhort time previous to the appearance of the fever, a remarkable diſeaſe occurred among the cats and rats in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, which carried off many hundreds of them. After the commencement of the ſickneſs, the dogs alſo were affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The diſeaſe which raged among the cats was ſimilar to that which attacked theſe animals previous to the appearance of the yellow fever in Philadelphia laſt year, and in New-York in 1796. Little attention has been paid to aſcertain the preciſe ſymptoms of this diſeaſe, ſo far as we know. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the animal was without appetite, but thirſty; and, at firſt, much inclined to ſleep; of a dull, melancholy turn, and ſoon began to look weak and thin. Many died in a numb and torpid ſtate, while others, in the laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, were ſeized with a delirium, puking, and an uncommon flow of frothy ſaliva from the mouth. A moaning or groaning noiſe was alſo very common—Theſe are the general ſymptoms, ſo far as we have obſerved them. In former periods, very little attention was paid to the ſtudy of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes incident to the brute creation. But, of late years, and particularly ſince the repeated appearance of the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in different parts of the United States, it has produced more obſervation; and, it is to be hoped, that a further and more minute examination of the nature of the epidemic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the brute animals, will add much new and uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to the healing art, particularly ſo far as it relates to epidemic diſeaſes among mankind.</p>
            <p>As diſtempers among domeſtic animals have more than once been obſerved to precede the yellow fever among the human ſpecies, and, by many, are now looked upon as their ſure harbinger, it is made, uſe of as an argument to corroborate the idea of domeſtic origin, and to ſtrengthen the theory of the prevalence of certain peſtilential fluids.</p>
            <p>In order, therefore, to prevent the adoption of any wrong or haſty concluſions upon this intereſting ſubject, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent imperfect ſtate of our knowledge of its cauſe, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending theſe diſeaſes, we ſhall ſtate what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation we have been able to collect, in hopes, that it may be of uſe in ſome future period, to direct us to more juſt and certain concluſions.</p>
            <p>

During the months of March and April 1797, a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſeaſe occurred among the cats in London, and extended over ſeveral other parts of England. In three pariſhes in London, upwards of 5,000 cats were computed to have been deſtroyed by it within a fortnight. The common pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the diſorder is ſaid to have been ſix or ſeven days.—The following is extracted from the "Account of the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in London, for the months of March and April, 1797," publiſhed in the Monthly Magazine, on this ſubject:</p>
            <p>"After the abatement of the epidemic catarrh, a violent diſeaſe fell among the cats, by which many hundreds of thoſe domeſtic animals periſhed: the particular ſymptoms of their malady, I had not ſufficient opportunity of aſcertaining: but, from diſſections, it appears, that the bowels had been drawn together by a violent cramp or ſpaſmodic conſtriction, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving likewiſe the omentum, and preventing any paſſage. In ſome, the inteſtines were partially red, or blackiſh; but, in the greater number of inſtances, the contraction and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary twiſting of the bowels, had taken place, without any marks of inflammation."</p>
            <p>This is probably the ſame diſeaſe which has appeared among the cats, in various parts of the United States. It made its appearance in Philadelphia in the latter end of May or beginning of June, 1797, when it was computed to have deſtroyed four or five thouſand cats. In New-York it was firſt obſerved in Auguſt, 1797. During its continuance there, a number of the cats, as was ſaid, left the city, and took refuge in the neighbouring country houſes. The number that died, was ſuppoſed to be three or four thouſand. In two inſtances, it was obſerved that lap-dogs, which were wont to play with the cats in the houſes to which they belonged, were affected with a ſimilar complaint. A diſtemper appeared among the cats in Hartford (Connecticut) about the end of July or beginning of Auguſt, 1797, where it carried off the greater part of theſe animals. It appeared in Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth (N. H.) about the ſame period; at Boſton in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; at Albany in October, and at Poughkeepſie, ſtate of New-York, towards the end of November. The ſame year it was alſo obſerved in many of the other towns in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States. We do not know of any inſtance of its being obſerved in any of the country places; but it was chiefly confined to the large cities. From a Bourdeaux newſpaper of October, 1797, it appears that France has been viſited by a ſimilar epidemic amongſt the cats. One of the health of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035335_0015_1001FE91F7A3B6A0"/>
had opened the body of a cat to diſcover the cauſe, and found in it a knot of worms. The name of the place is not mentioned, nor is there any other important information ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the account.</p>
            <p>Many other animals, beſides the cats, have of late been ſubject to the influence of ſimilar epidemics: Hydrophobia, or ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Hartford, Connecticut, in October, 1797, to ſuch an alarming degree, that the magiſtrates of the town were induced to exert the authority veſted in them by a law of the ſtate, for the confinement of all the dogs. Several other places were viſited about the ſame period with this dreadful diſeaſe. In Rhode-Iſland, ſeveral perſons and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle were bitten by mad dogs and died. The ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance took place in Berkſhire, Maſſachuſetts, and in many of the towns in the ſtate of Connecticut. The Rabies, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreadful diſtemper, prevailed among the dogs, in the ſame diſtricts and about the ſame period. It firſt appeared in the town of Berlin, about 12 miles from Hartford, (Con.) in the beginning of March, 1797. Shortly after, the ſame diſeaſe appeared at Hartford, New-Haven, Salem, Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field; and, in many neighbouring parts in the ſtate of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, where it proved fatal to ſome children, who were bitten by infected dogs. Numbers of cattle alſo died from the ſame cauſe. A peculiar diſtemper prevailed among the dogs in Philadelphia, this ſummer, at the beginning of the ſickneſs; perhaps it was produced from a want of ſuſtenance among thoſe who were left by their owners in the city. It is not in our power to ſtate the preciſe ſymptoms, nor even the period of the diſeaſe. In the generality of caſes, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal appeared penſive and dejected; did not refuſe food; but made no exertions to procure it; gradually became lean, and, in the laſt ſtage, would run to diſtant places, as if ſeized with canine madneſs; but, fortunately, when in this ſtate, they never attempted to bite any perſon or to do harm; nor would they even enter the houſe; but, when exhauſted, laid down in the fields and died. At a farm houſe, about ſix miles from Philadelphia, we are informed, that three or four dogs came ſick from the city, in one day, and expired in the farm yard.</p>
            <p>A very violent peſtilential diſorder prevailed among the cattle in many parts of Germany in the year 1796. Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Reich, of the univerſity of Erlangen, has wrote a ſmall
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035335_0016_100231BE82FEFF90"/>
tract upon the ſubject; and, we underſtand, he accounts for it upon the doctrine of peſtilential fluids, as laid down by Dr. Mitchell, of New-York. A diſeaſe of a very ſingular nature has prevailed among the cattle in many parts of the ſtate of Connecticut, for ten or twelve years paſt; an account of which is inſerted in the Medical Repoſitory, publiſhed at New-York, vol. 1, page 335.</p>
            <p>In ſome parts of Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, the foxes, during the winter of 1797-8, have been affected with a diſorder which rendered them an eaſy prey to the hunters. Of the particular ſymptoms, we have not been able to obtain any correct accounts. We are alſo informed, that geeſe, in ſome of the eaſtern ſtates, have been affected in a ſingular manner. Many have been known to ſeize ſome living ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with their bills, and adhere to them till they died.</p>
            <p>Nor are the land animals, alone, the objects of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. In the beginning of Auguſt 1797, a great mortality prevailed among the fiſh in James river, Virginia; the dead fiſh were ſeen floating down the river in aſtoniſhing quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities. In the ſummer of 1795, a ſimilar mortality occurred among the fiſh in Saratoga lake; and, ſome years ago, a diſeaſe is ſaid to have deſtroyed great numbers of fiſh in a pond near the town of Brookfield, in the ſtate of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts.</p>
            <p>What references are to be deduced from theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we leave for the medical Philoſopher to determine. But it does not appear very probable, that they are in any meaſure connected with the cauſe which produced the yellow fever among the human ſpecies; as they do not always appear in thoſe ſeaſons or places when and where that prevails, but generally in the moſt remote parts of the country, which is free from this human ſcourge.</p>
            <p>We ſhall cloſe this part of our ſubject with an account of the diſeaſes which prevailed in Philadelphia previous to its general calamity, as appeared in the Philadelphia Monthly Magazine for July, 1798.</p>
            <p>"July commenced with uncommonly hot weather; the city being pretty free from ſickneſs. The cholera infantum prevailed and carried off many children. On the 8th of the month, much rain fell, and the air became ſuddenly moiſt and cool. Many caſes of cholera and ſeveral of dyſentery occurred immediately afterwards. The ſubduction of heat from the ſkin, the torpor of its veſſels, and the accumulation of blood in the internal parts, in conſequence of the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

of cold to the body, might have been circumſtances favourable to the production of theſe diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>"A number of days, about the middle of the month, were extremely cool; eſpecially in the morning and evening: ſome of them very much reſembled autumnal weather. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of the month, ſome caſes of bilious fever, of a malignant nature, appeared; the weather was ſhowery and became warmer.</p>
            <p>"In treating the cholera infantum, bleeding, calomel, and bliſters, were uſed with advantage. Sometimes any one of theſe remedies would cure the diſeaſe. At other times, the whole of them would prove ineffectual, when it was very violent, or when medical aſſiſtance was delayed. The cold bath cured ſome ſlight caſes, and was employed with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the convaleſcent ſtate of this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>"In the dyſentery which occurred, the uſual remedies were ſucceſsful; ſuch as ſalts, caſtor-oil, laudanum, &amp;c. The laudanum, combined with antimonial wine, and given in the firſt and latter part of the night, proved moſt ſerviceable. In a violent caſe of the complaint, bleeding, bliſters and ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation were uſed with ſucceſs."</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Firſt appearance of the Diſeaſe—General alarm—Flight of the inhabitants, &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE now proceed to the taſk of recording the riſe, progreſs and attendant circumſtances of the late Yellow Fever, the moſt tremendous ſcourge, perhaps, ever experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the United States.</p>
            <p>Its origin is ſtill as much a ſubject of controverſy as in 1793. Thoſe who ſupport the idea of its domeſtic growth, inſiſt much on the long duration of moiſt, ſultry weather, the filth and ſtagnant water collected in our ſtreets, inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſcavengers, foul air diſcharged from the holds of veſſels, with their cargoes, ballaſt, &amp;c. The diſciples of this ſyſtem are, the <hi>Academy of Medicine</hi> and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. The arguments brought forward in ſupport of the above doctrine, are ſtrongly oppoſed by the <hi>College of Phyſicians,</hi> and their adherents. They inſiſt that it has been, moſt unequivocally, imported; that the weather has not been more ſultry this ſeaſon than in many other years, in which not even a ſporadic caſe of the diſorder was met with; that the police of our ſtreets is vaſtly better than formerly, eſpecially during the period that the Britiſh troops were here, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſubſequent to their abandonment of the city. With reſpect to the conſtruction of a city, very few are equal, hardly any ſuperior, to Philadelphia; the ventilation of which, is completely ſecured, let the wind blow in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever direction it may, by its ſtreets interſecting each other at right angles.</p>
            <p>Independent of theſe general arguments, it is contended, that the diſeaſe can be as ſatisfactorily traced to the veſſel or veſſels that introduced it, as the nature of the caſe will admit. For, it has been obſerved, that it is one of thoſe caſes, which will hardly admit of poſitive or judicial proof.</p>
            <p>The examination of the nature and origin of the diſeaſe, we ſhall treat, at large, in another part of this work; and, at
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035335_0027_100231D8CE5D0C38"/>
preſent, confine our inquiry only to the narration of thoſe circumſtances which occurred, and excited general alarm in the city during the period of its prevalence; but, it is neceſſary to remark, that a difference of opinion alſo exiſts reſpecting the <hi>nature</hi> of the yellow fever: Thoſe in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of its importation, aſſert that it is a diſtinct and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific diſeaſe, of itſelf, and highly contagious. Thoſe in favor of its domeſtic origin, affirm, that it is only a higher grade of the common bilious fever of this country, and that it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never contagious.</p>
            <p>Some caſes of highly bilious fever occurred ſo early as the month of June; and, perhaps, ſome even of yellow fever may have occurred during the months of June and July. The Academy of Medicine, in a letter to the Governor of Pennſylvania, dated December 3, 1798, mention eight ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the fever, which occurred between June 2d and July 12th; but, it does not appear, that the diſeaſe was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by infection from any of the caſes they mention; nor was any alarm excited till after that period.</p>
            <p>Many of the inhabitants ſuſpected, that, in certain places, the poiſon might remain during the winter, in the houſes, beds and apparel of thoſe who died with, or who had, the fever the preceding year, and that the heat of the ſun might again bring it into action this ſummer, perhaps from a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, founded upon a reference to the tranſient recurrence of a few caſes of the yellow fever, in the fall which ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 1793. Upon which account, it was natural to expect, that the inhabitants would be upon their guard, and uſe every means in their power to prevent the return of ſo dreadful a calamity; and, if it ſhould be found impoſſible to prevent it, that they would, upon its firſt appearance, ſound the alarm.</p>
            <p>The legiſlature of Pennſylvania, having found, by experience, that the exiſting "laws, for preventing the importation of infectious or contagious diſeaſes into the port of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and the Health-Office ſyſtem thereby eſtabliſhed, were defective and inadequate," in April, 1798, paſſed "an Act to alter and amend the ſame, and to extend the powers of the Board of Health." Agreeable to the tenor of this law, a Board of Health was inſtituted. They entered upon the important and arduous duties of their office in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of May laſt; and, although they were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the new one was ſtill defective, and inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the purpoſes contemplated by its framers, they
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035335_0028_1001FE97160F1840"/>
were determined to make up for its deficiency, if poſſible, by their own vigilance.</p>
            <p>On the 1ſt of May, the following extract from An act to alter and amend the health laws of Pennſylvania, paſſed the 4th of April, was publiſhed by order of the Board of Health, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "Sec. 8. And be it further enacted by the authority aforeſaid, that every houſe-keeper within the city of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, the townſhips of the Northern Liberties and Moya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſing, and diſtrict of Southwark, within one mile of the limits of the city, taking in boarders, arriving by ſea or by land, from any foreign port or place, and having any board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his or her family, who ſhall be taken ſick of any diſeaſe whatſoever, between the firſt day of May and the firſt day of November, in any year, within twenty days next after ſuch boarder ſhall come to lodge in his or her houſe, ſhall, within twenty-four hours next after the knowledge of ſuch ſickneſs, make report at the Health-Office of the name of ſuch ſick perſon, the time of his or her arrival at the houſe, and of his or her being taken ſick, and of the name and place of abode of ſuch houſekeeper; whereupon the Phyſician of the Health-Office ſhall forthwith viſit the patient, and report to the Office his opinion of the nature of ſuch diſeaſe, that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures may be taken to prevent the ſpreading of infection; and if any houſe-keeper ſhall neglect to give information in the manner and within the time aforeſaid, and ſhall be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of convicted, in any court of criminal juriſdiction within this commonwealth, upon indictment or confeſſion, he or ſhe ſhall forfeit and pay a fine to the uſe of the ſaid hoſpital, not leſs than twenty dollars, nor more than one hundred dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to be impoſed at the diſcretion of the court, according to the circumſtances of greater or leſs aggravation attending each particular caſe."</p>
            <p>The 5th ſection of the ſame law enacted, "That all veſſels arriving at the port of Philadelphia, during the months of May, June, July, Auguſt, September, October and November, from any port in the Mediterranean, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters connected therewith to the eaſtward of the Straits of Gibraltar, or from the coaſt of Africa without the Straits, other than the Cape of Good Hope, and from the main land of North or South-America, or the Weſt-India Iſlands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the latitude of the river St. Mary in Georgia, and the beginning of the latitude of thirty degrees ſouth of the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſhall be ſubjected to ride quarantine before the Marine Hoſpital on State-Iſland (about five miles below the city)
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035335_0029_100231DD861111F0"/>
for a term not exceeding ten, nor more than twenty days." In conſequence of which, it was the uniform practice of the Board of Managers to ſubject all unſuſpected veſſels to a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine of ten days only.</p>
            <p>At a meeting of the Board, on the 28th of the ſame month, it was repreſented that the health laws had been frequently violated and evaded, by perſons landing from veſſels under quarantine, and that the reſident phyſician and other officers of the inſtitution, had been obſtructed and groſsly inſulted in the legal exerciſe of their duties, in open and avowed contempt of the laws, and to the great danger of the health of the city. The board, therefore, "reſolved, "That the reſident phyſician, or health-officer of the marine hoſpital, inform all perſons under quarantine, that the 2d Section of the act to alter and amend the health laws, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed April 4th, 1798, will be ſtrictly enforced, and that no perſon under quarantine be permitted to land, except in eaſe of imminent diſtreſs, or abſolute neceſſity, agreeably to the ſaid Section." This reſolution, together with the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alluded to, was publiſhed for the benefit of all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The following is a copy, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>"Sec. 2. And be it further enacted by the authority afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, That every ſhip or veſſel, coming from any foreign port or place, bound to the port of Philadelphia, between the laſt day of April and the firſt day of December, in every year, ſhall come to anchor in the river Delaware, as near to the Marine Hoſpital as her draft of water and the ſtate of the tide and weather will reaſonably admit, before any part of the cargo or baggage be landed, or any perſon who came in ſuch ſhip or veſſel, ſhall leave her; and ſhall ſubmit to the examinations, and obtain the certificate hereafter ſpecified: And if any maſter, commander, or pilot, ſhall leave his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the ſaid hoſpital, or if any maſter or commander ſhall permit or ſuffer any part of the cargo or baggage, or any perſon or perſons arriving in ſuch ſhip or veſſel, from any port beyond the limits of the United States, to be landed on either ſhore of Delaware Bay or river, before ſuch examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be duly had, and certificate obtained, the perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo permitting, and the perſon or perſons ſo landing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caſe of imminent diſtreſs, or abſolute neceſſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof convicted upon indictment, under this act, by verdict, confeſſion, or ſtanding mute, in any court having criminal juriſdiction within this commonwealth, ſhall be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to, and ſuffer confinement in the gaol of the county
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035335_0030_100231DF12A329F8"/>
of Philadelphia, for any ſpace not leſs than one, nor more than three years."</p>
            <p>The board, likewiſe, directed the Health-Officer reſiding at the Marine Hoſpital, to viſit every veſſel, riding quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, at leaſt once every twenty-four hours, at irregular times, to call the roll of the crew and paſſengers, and to ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that they were all on board; and, if any others ſhould be found on board, to ſubject them to remain until the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the period of the veſſel's quarantine. But, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe precautions, on the 12th of June, the Board received information that two perſons had been on board one of the veſſel's then under quarantine; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were accordingly proſecuted. The law was alſo evaded by a mode ſtill more dangerous to the health of the city and its neighbourhood: both perſons and goods were landed in the ſtate of Delaware, previous to the veſſel's reaching State-Iſland; which perſons, together with their goods, proceeded to the city. Information of this nature was communicated to the Board on the 16th of July; and, on the ſame day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of another nature, drew, from the Health-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the following advertiſement: "Whereas, repreſentations have been made to the Managers of the Marine and City-Hoſpitals, that frequent communication is had between ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of Philadelphia and elſewhere, and perſons on board of veſſels under quarantine, by means of boats going along ſide, to the great danger of the health of the city: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, reſolved, that every veſſel with which ſuch communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been permitted, ſhall perform an additional quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of five days."</p>
            <p>There is great reaſon for ſuppoſing that communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between the city and the veſſels under quarantine were carried on to a very great extent. It is ſaid, that perſons from theſe veſſels frequently came to the city in the night, and returned again next morning. We are more particular in mentioning theſe circumſtances; for, it is poſſible that ſome of the earlier caſes of the fever were thus introduced.</p>
            <p>About the end of June, a very great influx of foreigners from the Weſt-Indies took place, which created the alarm of government, from a repreſentation, that their views were hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to the peace of our country; but this proved to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature. It was cauſed by the evacuation of Port-au-Prince by the Britiſh troops. Eight veſſels arrived at the port of Philadelphia on the 5th of July, from the ports of Cape-Nichola-Mole, Jeremic and Port-au-Prince, bringing two
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035335_0031_100231E4A2B14578"/>
hundred and twenty-ſeven paſſengers, and one hundred and ſixteen ſeamen. The ſudden death of the Marquis de Rouvray, ſhortly after his arrival in one of theſe veſſels, gave ground for ſuſpicion, that the ſeeds of the diſeaſe might have been thus early imported.</p>
            <p>The period of quarantine, preſcribed by law, was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed to be inſufficient. The Board of Health, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obviate bad conſequences from this defect, on the 2d July, procured ſix of Wynkoop's ventilators; the uſe of which had been ſtrenuouſly recommended, in 1797, to the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and legiſlature of Pennſylvania, by the Academy of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as being admirably adapted for expelling the foul air from the holds of veſſels, and preſerving the cargo and tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from putrefaction. Theſe ventilators, the Board direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the reſident phyſician to uſe in all veſſels that he ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted might require them.</p>
            <p>While the Board of Health were thus employing every means, which they could deviſe, to prevent a return of the fever by importation, the ſelect and common councils, and many other citizens, were equally vigilant, both by private example and public authority, to guard againſt its domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic generation. The ſtreets and alleys were kept clean; the police-officers were enjoined to be vigilant in their duty, and the inhabitants cheerfully gave them aid. The following paragraphs, from the newſpapers, will convey a more perfect idea how far theſe precautions were reſpected, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

                        <p>The preſent very warm weather, naturally reminds many citizens of the watering carts, which are depoſited in the large wooden-building at the corner of Walnut and Sixth-ſtreets.</p>
                        <p>There can be no ſeaſon of the year in which they might be uſed to greater advantage; and it is the earneſt wiſh, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, of all Philadelphia, that they were immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the purpoſes for which they were made. As to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, expenſe, &amp;c. ſurely theſe are no objects in a city, which has too often experienced the fatal effects of dry, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted air.</p>
                        <p>As the great danger is from a collection of dirt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent putrefaction in our gutters, I would further propoſe, that the perſons appointed to clean the ſtreets, inſtead of ſweeping off the looſe, dry dirt, which had much better be left where it is, ſhould be employed in pumping the water
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035335_0032_100231E62FEF9F28"/>
into the gutters, and giving them, at leaſt, a daily cleanſing. Beſides the public pumps, there are a great number of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ones, whoſe owners would be glad to have them uſed in this manner, not only for the general good, but for their own ſakes; as it is well known nothing contributes more to mending the water, than frequent pumping.</p>

                        <head>Advice to the inhabitants of Philadelphia and other cities in the United States.</head>
                        <p>The ſummer ſeaſon is the ſeaſon of fevers, and of thoſe inflammatory diſeaſes which attack man. It is principally large cities that are ſubject to theſe misfortunes.</p>
                        <p>The efferveſcence of the bile is one of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſes of thoſe diſeaſes in the warm weather. I think it will be rendering humanity ſervice to point out ſome means of preſervation againſt the deſtroying peſtilence.</p>
                        <p>One of the general cauſes of epidemical diſeaſes, is the noxious quality of air, which becomes vitiated by a variety of circumſtances to which the magiſtrates ſhould pay the cloſeſt attention:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The ſtreets often ſtrewed, for days together, with the putrefying carcaſes of dead animals, ſhould be cleanſed.—Theſe ſtreets ſhould be daily watered, and the gutters ſwept.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A watchful ſuperintendance ſhould take place over ſeveral kinds of manufacturies, particularly breweries, ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and others liable to have heaps of fermenting mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A ſevere penalty ſhould be inflicted on keeping pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid ſubſtances in the city.</p>
                        <p>I will mention an inſtance: A few days ago, ſeveral bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of putrid beef were buried a very few inches under ground, and on the outſkirts of the city. Putrid ſubſtances ſhould be thrown into the river, at a conſiderable diſtance below the city.</p>
                        <p>It would alſo be very adviſeable to bury the dead, at leaſt during the hot weather, at a diſtance from the city, and a conſiderable depth.</p>
                        <p>A ſtop put to the abuſes I have been ſpeaking of, would certainly contribute to the preſervation of the cities of the United States from that dreadful diſeaſe, known by the name of the yellow fever.</p>
                        <p>As a preſervation for individuals, I would recommend the uſe of acids and vomits to thoſe who have the ſtomach
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035335_0033_100231E8ACE5A318"/>
loaded with bile. The diſuſe of animal food, and of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous liquors, a vegetable and plain diet; in a word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can cool down the heat of the blood and the efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the bile, are recommended.</p>

                        <p>It gave me pleaſure in obſerving in this morning's paper that the Select and Common Councils had enjoined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the city commiſſioners to have the ſtreets, lanes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys and gutters kept free and clear of all noxious matter and filth; but I am ſorry they did not ſee the neceſſity of paying ſome attention to the different docks, and having them clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and kept ſo; as I am of opinion there is as much danger to be apprehended to the health of the city from the putrid filth and noxious matter that lays, for ſeveral hours in the day, expoſed to the ſun, in many of the docks, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at Market-ſtreet, as from any other ſource.

            <p>In conſequence of the extraordinary vigilance of the city commiſſioners, in junction with the inhabitants, the ſtreets, lanes and alleys, within the city, were never known, in any former period, to be kept cleaner, or in better order.

On the 2d July, Drs. Wiſtar and Duffield communicated to the board of health, the death of Mr. Mark Miller (one of the eight caſes formerly mentioned,) with the yellow fever, at the houſe of Mr. Mark Reeve, merchant, Callowhill-ſtreet, between Front and Second-ſtreets; whereupon, the board ordered the houſe in which he died to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and white-waſhed; his bedding and apparel to be taken to the city-hoſpital, and buried, for purification; and that Mr. Reeve's family, and thoſe who attended Mr. Miller, be recommended to remove from the city. All this was punctually complied with, and no perſon was afterwards known to have taken the fever from Mr. Miller. There was not a doubt, among the phyſicians, reſpecting the nature of the diſeaſe of which Mr. Miller died. Drs. Hodge and Wiſtar, who attended him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to have been a true caſe of yellow fever: the black vomit, one of its moſt ſure and violent characteriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, appeared previous to death. This being one of the earlieſt caſes which created alarm, or apprehenſion in the city, this ſummer, we ſhall be particular to aſcertain the preciſe circumſtances of the caſe. Dr. Currie, in his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of the Yellow Fever of</hi> 1798, ſtates the particulars thus: "June 27th, cool, thermometer only 76° at two P. M. Mark Miller died to-day under the care of Drs. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and Hodge, with ſymptoms of the yellow fever, at Mrs. Reeves's, in Callowhill-ſtreet. He had been much fatigued and debilitated, from loading a veſſel at Almond-ſtreet wharf, a mile from his lodgings, in the heat of the day, to which he had walked daily for ſometime. He had, alſo, according to the account of Mrs. Reeves, ſlept on the bed in which her ſon had died of the fever the preceding autumn." By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Dr. Currie's ſtatement with our narration, it will appear evident, that he has been miſinformed reſpecting ſome of the particulars of this caſe. Mr. Reeve informs us, that laſt fall, after the fever had ſo far ſubſided, that the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were returning to the city, a boy in his employ was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ill with what was ſuppoſed to be the yellow fever. He had a mild attack, and recovered. During his illneſs, a thick bed-quilt was conſtantly kept between the bed-linen and the bed, and that, after his recovery, the bed was, according to advice of the phyſician, laid in an open field amongſt the graſs, and there ſuffered to remain for a week or ten days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the cold air and white froſt. The bed was afterwards brought home, and, from that period, was in conſtant uſe in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035335_0035_100231ED50B659D0"/>
the family. Mr. Miller ſlept upon it for many months pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to his death. On the night of June 5th, Mr. Miller ſat up to watch the corpſe of Benjamin Jones, taylor, in Fromberger's court. Mr. Jones had been but ſix or ſeven weeks reſident in Philadelphia. About ſeven or eight months previous, he had been bit by a dog ſuppoſed to be mad. He was delirious and attempted to bite his attendants. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances produced ſuſpicion that he had the hydrophobia; but his phyſician, Dr. Phyſick, who opened his body after death, aſſerted it to be the yellow fever. Mr. Miller was taken ſick on the night of June 20, ſome days previous to which, he had fatigued himſelf in ſhipping ſome goods at Almond-ſtreet wharf, upwards of a mile from his lodgings: to which he walked daily. Whether he caught the infection from Benjamin Jones, whoſe body had been opened, or from any remaining contagion in the bed, or any other local cauſe, it will be difficult to determine; the probability is, that he had imbibed the infection from one or the other of theſe firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned cauſes, and that it was excited into action by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatiguing himſelf in the heat of the day.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that two other perſons, who were taken ſick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they went to the country, ſuppoſe that they caught the infection from the above-mentioned Mr. Jones. They were attended in the country by Dr. Iſaac Huddleſton, of Norriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. They, however, recovered.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 8th July, the armed ſhip Deborah, captain Edward Yard, arrived at the fort from Jeremie. By the following anſwers to the official queſtions, preſcribed by law, it appears that ſhe buried eight perſons during her ſtay there and paſſage home, and that the harbour of Jeremie was ſickly.</p>

            <p>On the 16th of July, the Board of Health directed the reſident and conſulting phyſicians, to examine the ſhip De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, and report to them their opinion reſpecting her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition previous to the expiration of her quarantine, and to cauſe the bedding and apparel of thoſe who had died, to be landed at the marine hoſpital for purification; accordingly, on the 17th of the ſame month, Dr. Samuel Duffield, the conſulting phyſician, and Dr. James Hall, the reſident phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, reported, that they had viſited and carefully examined the ſtate of the ſhip Deborah, captain Yard, from Jeremie; and had found the ſame remarkably clean, and the people on board, in perfect health: Captain Yard informed them, that he loſt three of his people in Hiſpaniola, and two on his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage home; the laſt on the 24th of June, beſides three paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers; one was a lady juſt from Europe: ſhe died on the 2d of July, of a fever, which terminated in conſtant purging, but without vomiting, or any uncommon yellowneſs of the ſkin. A white child died on the 26th of June, and a Negro child died on the 7th of July. The latter ſuppoſed to be occaſioned by a wound which it had received on the head, by running againſt one of the pikes. That the captain was of opinion, that all his people who died, brought on their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes by intemperance, and by expoſing themſelves, when in that ſtate, to the rain and night air. That he further declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, that none of the people who died, either of his crew or the paſſengers, had any thing like black vomiting, extraordinary yellowneſs of the ſkin, or, as far as he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge, with any of the ſtriking ſymptoms of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever; and that their diſeaſes were not communicated to any other perſons from any of thoſe that died. That upon conſidering the report of captain Yard, and comparing it with the preſent very healthy appearance of the people on board, none of whom appeared to them to have been affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the diſeaſes of thoſe who died, and the number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons now on board (ninety-five) they were of opinion, that
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035335_0038_100231F7A77D7388"/>
the diſeaſes of which the before-mentioned perſons died, were not of a contagious nature: That they were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this opinion, from the ſtate of the four perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that ſhip, who were then in the marine hoſpital, none of whom exhibited any ſymptoms whatever of a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious or malignant nature: That they were alſo of opinion, that the ſhip was now in a perfect and wholeſome ſtate; that the people were free from every appearance of contagion: that the bedding and cloathing of all the perſons who died in the veſſel, had either been thrown overboard, or landed at the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of this report, the Deborah was permitted to proceed to the city; where ſhe arrived on the 18th of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diſcharged her cargo near Race-ſtreet wharf.</p>
            <p>Many circumſtances have occurred to excite ſtrong ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion that the contagion was imported in the ſhip Deborah. In conſequence of which, we have endeavoured, as far as is in our power, to acquire a juſt knowledge of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant facts relative thereto; and to ſtate them with all poſſible preciſion, that the public may be the better enabled to form a correct judgment upon this important queſtion.</p>
            <p>The Deborah ſailed from Philadelphia in February, 1798, for Cape Nichola-Mole; where ſhe arrived in March; in April ſhe ſailed from thence to Port-au-Prince, from Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au-Prince to Jeremie, and from thence back to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Theſe places, which are in the iſland of Hiſpaniola or St. Domingo, had long been garriſoned by Britiſh troops. In conſequence of which, they were more peculiarly adapted to the generation of peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Dr. Curric was informed by Mr. Lewis, the mate, that previous to the Deborah's taking in her cargo, at Jeremie, ſhe was employed as a tranſport in the Britiſh ſervice. That the yellow fever prevailed in thoſe places to which the Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah went is aſcertained by captain Yard's anſwer to the official queſtion, No. 11. He alſo acknowledged <q>in converſation with a gentleman ſhortly after his arrival in Philadelphia, that while he lay at Jeremie, a very mortal diſeaſe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent there, which the natives called the <hi>Maladie de Slam</hi> (a name by which the yellow fever is known in many parts of the Weſt-Indies, particularly the French Iſlands) of which the captain and the chief part of the crew of an Engliſh ſhip, from Liverpool, died.<note n="*" place="bottom">Currie's Memoirs, p. 132.</note>

                        <p>During my reſidence at Santo-Domingo and the Cape, I received frequent information that the yellow fever prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in almoſt all the ſea-port towns in the French part of Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola, particularly at Cape Nichola-Mole. It raged ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently at this latter place, and the mortality was ſo great, that it obliged the Britiſh to abandon the poſt ſooner than they intended. About the ſame time this diſeaſe made its appearance in the harbour of St. Thomas, and was ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructive to foreigners, that it obtained the name of <hi>the plague</hi> from all thoſe who ſpoke of it. At Santo Domingo I ſaw ſeveral caſes of it, during the months of Auguſt and Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Theſe were entirely confined to American ſeamen, while the native inhabitants of the city were altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from it. The privateers which frequented this port loſt alſo ſeveral of their crew by this fever, while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at anchor.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to you that a ſimilar diſeaſe had broke out on board of the ſchooner Swift, at Porto-Rico. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are the facts reſpecting that veſſel, <abbr>viz.</abbr> On the 11th of laſt March, ſhe ſailed from the Delaware, and, after touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Tortola and St. Thomas, arrived at the city of Santo Domingo on the 13th of April, where ſhe continued until the 26th of June, when, ſhe went to the Cape, and returned again on the 1ſt of Auguſt, without touching at any other port. She remained at Santo Domingo until the 28th of October, and then ſailed for Porto-Rico, where ſhe arrived on the 5th of November. She anchored at the entrance of the harbour, at a conſiderable diſtance from any other veſſel. A ſhort time before ſhe left the city of Santo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo, ſhe took on board, from a French privateer that had been diſmantled, a quantity of rigging, ſails, guns and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. From the time that ſhe left Philadelphia until her arrival at Porto-Rico, the crew were healthy, except two of the ſailors, who were affected with venereal complaints. The ſecond day after ſhe anchored at this latter port, the mate and one of the ſailors began to complain; and the greateſt part of the crew, together with the captain, were ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attacked. The two firſt died after a ſhort illneſs, and one
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035335_0040_1001FEA2019F67C0"/>
of the others during her paſſage to America. The captain eſcaped, in conſequence of being brought on ſhore and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attended, at the commencement of the diſorder. When ſhe arrived at Porto-Rico, and during her ſtay there, both the harbour and city were remarkably healthy, and her crew had little or no communication with either the ſhore or the ſhipping. Theſe are all the facts which have come to my knowledge reſpecting the exiſtence of this diſeaſe in the Weſt-Indies, during the laſt ſummer and fall.</p>

                        <p>On the 27th Auguſt, 1798, before Joſeph Bloomfield, mayor of the city of Burlington, appeared John Boden, of ſaid city, ſhip-carpenter and free-holder in the ſame; and being duly ſworn, depoſeth and ſaith, that on the 1ſt Dec. 1797, this deponent ſhipped himſelf as carpenter on board the Deborah, Edward Yard, commander: that ſaid ſhip ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Philadelphia in February laſt, for Cape Nichola-Mole, and arrived at ſaid Cape about the middle of March; from whence the ſaid ſhip, in April laſt, went to Port-au-Prince; while at Port-au-Prince, Henry Philips, one of the ſailors of ſaid ſhip, was taken very ill with what is called the yellow fever: that, during his illneſs, the ſaid Henry Philips told this deponent (and often times ſince) that he had taken the yellow fever, in attendance upon a man of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who had the yellow fever, and died on board an Engliſh brig at Port-au-Prince, while the ſaid Philips was on board ſaid brig, and with his ſaid acquaintance. This deponent further ſaith, that ſaid Henry Philips has a wiſe in Philadelphia; but is now on a voyage to Europe. That this deponent aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Deborah remained ten days at Smith's wharf, near Race-ſtreet, diſcharging her cargo; and, on the 25th of July, ſhe was removed to Mr. Eyre's wharf, in Kenſington, to be repaired.

                        <p>Mr. Thomas Town, citizen of the Northern Liberties, Philadelphia, related to Dr. Wiſtar, that on the 1ſt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1798, he ſaw Alexander Philips, late of Water-ſtreet, taylor, in Second ſtreet, and inquired of him, whether it was true (as reported) that he had brought up privately ſome ſick men from the ſhip Deborah, ſoon after her arrival in the river, and had received ten dollars for ſo doing; and, that Philips replied, that he had brought up two or three in one or two boats. Mr. Town believes he ſaid that he had
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035335_0042_1002320912E03EB0"/>
gone down as low as Marcus Hook. Philips ſaid he had taken ſome of them to his own houſe, and that one was dead. He added, that he was ſorry it had been done; that he was ſick himſelf, but hoped his complaint would turn out a cold.</p>
                        <p>He ſtated that he had done it as an act of friendſhip, in return for favours received.</p>
                        <p>On the Sunday morning following, Mr. Town was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to Philips's funeral.</p>

Mr. Purdon obſerved to him, with horror and aſtoniſhment, that he had acted very wrong, and immediately departed from his houſe. Mr. Philips, on that day, was apparently in perfect health; on the Saturday night following he was a corpſe.

                        <head>Extract from Dr. Currie's defence of the opinions of the College of Phyſicians.</head>
                        <p>To weaken, and, as far as in their power, to invalidate the opinion of the College reſpecting the origin of the diſeaſe in Philadelphia laſt year, the Academy have brought forward the teſtimony of ſeveral perſons in ſome degree intereſted in diſguiſing, or at leaſt withholding ſome part of the truth. Theſe go to prove that the declaration of Alexander Philips, who told Meſſrs. Towne and Purdon, ſeverally, and at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times, that he had brought ſick perſons to his houſe, was falſe. Mr. Purdon had called on Philips to requeſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an account he owed him—Philips aſſured him that he would pay him in a few days, as he had been down the river and brought up an old lodger, whom he had occaſion for as a witneſs, but that he was then ſick.</p>
                        <p>That Philips had a man, belonging to the Deborah, ſick in his houſe, at the time he was ſick himſelf, is certain from the teſtimony of Dr. Griffitts, who preſcribed for him.</p>

            </q>
            <p>There was no inſtance of the fever being in Kenſington until the Deborah went there, nor was it in any caſe known to be contagious before her arrival. The people belonging to her, labourers who aſſiſted to unload her, carpenters who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired her, and others who viſited her, were the firſt who were attacked with the diſeaſe; indeed, a very conſiderable proportion of the firſt caſes have been traced to this veſſel. [<hi>See the recapitulation at the end of this chapter.</hi>]</p>
            <p>It is probable that the contagion was imported from the Weſt-Indies in other veſſels beſides the Deborah. On the 21ſt of July, the ſchooner Aurora, with eleven paſſengers,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035335_0045_1002321737CC87D8"/>
and fourteen ſeamen, and the Ariel, with twenty-two paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and twelve ſeamen, arrived at the fort from Cape-Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chola-Mole. <hi>Two</hi> paſſengers died on board the Aurora, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her paſſage. She was boarded in the bay of Delaware, on the 16th of July, by James Nagglee, pilot. Then it rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He got wet, and in that ſtate, he ſlept upon the deck. He alſo ſlept upon the deck on the 19th, expoſed to the ſun; and on the 22d, he complained of pains in his legs and feet. He was taken to the Marine Hoſpital, on State-Iſland, on the 23d, and <hi>died</hi> (July 28th)—the <hi>fifth</hi> day after his admiſſion. Previous to his death, he became delirious, vomited blood, and bled at the noſe.</p>
            <p>The mate of the Aurora alſo died at the Marine Hoſpital. When he was admitted, he had a ſwelling in his groin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſores in ſundry other parts of his body—par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly his head; but, upon examination, he denied that it was <hi>lues venera.</hi> When landed, he walked up to the hoſpital, and did not appear to have a high fever; but, the day after, he was ſuddenly taken with a convulſion fit, and died deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous on the <hi>ſixth</hi> day after his admiſſion.</p>
            <p>The Ariel was boarded by James Roland, pilot, on the 16th of July; he ſlept in the mate's birth, and was not expoſed to the bad weather. He was a very temperate, ſober man. On the 25th, he complained of a ſevere pain in the head, and was ſent to the Marine Hoſpital on the 26th. When admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he had a ſlow fever, and complained of great weakneſs. He died on the <hi>third</hi> day after his admiſſion. Previous to death, he was affected with the hickup, oppreſſion of the breaſt, and heavy breathing. He bled once at the mouth, and his ſkin was yellow.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances induced the Board of Health, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the quarantine of the Aurora and Ariel to twenty days; during which, they were well cleanſed, waſhed with vinegar, white-waſhed, and had two of Wynkoop's ventilators work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on board. They came to the city on the 10th of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>On the 19th of July, the brig Mary arrived at the fort from Kingſton, Jamaica, with ſix paſſengers and twenty-two ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. After ten days quarantine, ſhe came up to the city, (July 29) and began to diſcharge her cargo, conſiſting of cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee and cocoa, at Roſs and Simpſon's wharf, below Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-ſtreet. Part of the cargo was much damaged, and in a putrid ſtate. Several ſudden deaths occurred about this time in the neighbourhood, and the inhabitants were alarmed.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035335_0046_1002321B14BEE9C0"/>
In conſequence, information was lodged at the health-office, purporting that the coffee and cocoa, landed from ſaid brig, and ſtored at Roſs and Simpſon's, was in a putrid ſtate, and extremely offenſive. Likewiſe, that a ſtore in the ſame block of buildings, belonging to Mr. Dawſon, contained a quantity of hides, in a putrid and offenſive condition. That Mr. Dawſon had died that morning of a fever, which had excited great alarm in that neighbourhood, and that his daughter was ill of the ſame fever. In conſequence of this report, the mayor, by requeſt of the board, cauſed all the coffee to be returned on board the brig; and ordered, that ſhe ſhould be removed from the wharf oppoſite to the Wind-Mill iſland; from whence ſhe was, together with all the hands who worked on board, removed to State-iſland, where the articles were landed for purification, and the veſſel carefully cleanſed.</p>
            <p>The Academy of Medicine, in their communication to the Board of Health, of the 8th of Auguſt, ſay, that they <hi>derive</hi> the rapid progreſs of the fever, during the firſt week of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, to the foul air of ſeveral ſhips lately arrived in the port, and from the damaged coffee of the above veſſel. But, as the diſeaſe had made ſome progreſs before the arrival of the bring Mary, it could not, therefore, have proceeded from her alone.</p>
            <p>The conſulting phyſician, on the 25th of July, intimated to the Board of Health, that two ſtrangers, who had arrived at a tavern in Front-ſtreet, were lying ſick; and, on the 30th of the ſame month, Chriſtopher Holmes, from Penn-ſtreet, was ſent to the Marine hoſpital; that the houſe was ordered to be cleanſed, and the bedding and apparel removed to the City Hoſpital for purification. The ſame day, a report was made to the board, by Mr. James Yard and Dr. Samuel Duffield, ſtating, that George Ralſton, who had laboured on board the Deborah, died that day, after a ſhort illneſs. A letter from Dr. Hall, the ſame day, mentioned the death of a perſon, who was taken to the Marine Hoſpital from the ſhip Neſtor.</p>
            <p>The number of deaths and new caſes of the fever, which daily increaſed from the 28th of July to the 6th of Auguſt, alarmed the citizens, and became a general topic of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The college of Phyſicians met on the ſixth of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guſt: at which time about 26 caſes of the fever were known to exiſt in the city. After conferring together, they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed to the following reſolutions; which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately communicated to the Board of Health:</p>

                        <p>The board alſo earneſtly recommend to the inhabitants of that part of the city, included between Walnut and Spruce-ſtreets, and the eaſt ſide of Front-ſtreet and the river, and alſo thoſe immediately in the vicinity thereof, to remove without the bounds of the city and Liberties as ſpeedily as poſſible.</p>

            <p>The veſſels were accordingly removed from the wharves above ſpecified. But, inſtead of being "removed to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſtance from the city," as recommended by the College, they were diſtributed to the other wharves. Moſt of them
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035335_0048_10023221FAFABD58"/>
were ſent to the upper parts of the city. The brig Mary, who brought the damaged coffee, &amp;c. was the only veſſel which was removed from the city. Perhaps from this cauſe it was, that the diſeaſe, ſoon afterwards, ſo rapidly ſpread, and produced ſuch a general depopulation. Another circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which may have aided its ſpreading, ought not to paſs unnoticed: a quantity of the damaged coffee, before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſcattered on the wharf, which the itinerant poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately gathered up; and thus, probably, carried home the inſtrument of their deſtruction!</p>
            <p>The removal of the inhabitants, from the city, was earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended in the daily papers; nor was any time loſt in communicating the cauſe for alarm. The following com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, recommending proviſion for the removal of the poor, is extracted from <hi>Porcupine's Gazette,</hi> of Auguſt 7th, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>The yellow fever is in this city. It is now come out, that it made its appearance about a week ago. Several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are dead with it, and, according to all the accounts I have heard, it ſpreads with greater rapidity than it did laſt year.</p>
            <p>A number of ſtories, with regard to its origin, are, as uſual, on foot; but, I believe, the beſt way would be to lay aſide all vain diſputes on this ſubject, and prepare, as quick as poſſible, to make proviſion for removing thoſe who have not the means of removing themſelves, to ſituations more healthy.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Gazette, on the ſame day, contained the following</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Communication</hi>—An immediate attention to the advice of the board of health, in evacuating the infected quarter is, perhaps, the only meaſure by which our unfortunate city can be reſcued from increaſing affliction. Individual intereſt ſhould yield to a temporary ſacrifice, in order to avert the public calamity. It is a duty every citizen owes to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as well as to himſelf, to be vigilant in removing the objects, and thereby impeding the progreſs of contagion.</p>
            <p>To thoſe who neceſſarily remain in the city, it is almoſt ſuperfluous to intimate the neceſſity of avoiding thoſe parts where the contagion prevails. A ſentiment of ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if not of duty to ſociety, will be a ſufficient reſtraint.—Under the favor of heaven, and our own precaution, we may then hope to be ſoon reſtored to health, proſperity, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

                        <p>THE Academy of Medicine of Philadelphia, having taken into conſideration the exiſtence of a malignant bilious fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in this city, have conceived it to be their duty to lay before the managers of the Marine and City Hoſpitals, the following facts reſpecting its origin, and the means of checking its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
                        <p>We have, upon inquiry, diſcovered that a caſe of this fever exiſted in the city on the 6th of June, and that ſeveral caſes of it exiſted in July, in parts of the city remote from the river, and wholly unconnected with each other. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to originate from the putrid exhalations of alleys and gutters, and docks, and from the ſtagnating water in the neighbourhood of the city. We derive the late rapid increaſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ever from the foul air of ſeveral ſhips lately arrived in the port, and from ſome damaged coffee which arrived in a brig from Jamaica on the 29th of July. In the courſe of our inquiries into the origin of the fever, we did not meet with a ſingle fact that could ſupport the opinion of contagion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imported in the bodies or clothes of ſick people in the ſhips or veſſels which lie between Walnut and Spruce ſtreets, where the diſeaſe has prevailed moſt. Many reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able modern authorities aſſert that the yellow fever is <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious</hi> in the Weſt-Indies, and repeated obſervations ſatisfy us, that it is rarely ſo during the <hi>warm weather</hi> in the United States. None of the caſes we have as yet ſeen, have propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated it, and we conceive it to be an error as abſurd, in its nature, as it has been fatal in its operation upon the city of Philadelphia, that the contagion of a diſeaſe ſhould adhere to the timber of a ſhip after a ſea voyage, and ſhould ſpread from the timber of the ſhip without contact through an extenſive neighbourhood, and ceaſe to communicate itſelf afterwards by long and cloſe connection of the ſick with their families and attendants. We lament that this fact, together with many others upon the nature and origin of the yellow fever, which were ſtated in our letter to the Governor, on the 1ſt of December, 1797, and by him laid before the legiſlature of the ſtate, have been treated with total neglect in the preſent health law: the diſtreſs we felt upon ſeeing that law is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, much alleviated by the reflection, that we have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed,

                        <p n="1">1ſt. The removal of all the families from thoſe parts of the city where the diſeaſe, from the contamination of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, appears chiefly to exiſt, and the preventing thoſe parts being viſited by the citizens.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>ABOUT the beginning of Auguſt, the news-papers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the uncommon healthineſs of the city; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which has occurred towards the beginning of that peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in almoſt every city of the United States, where it has appeared. It was the caſe with Philadelphia, New-York, and Baltimore, in 1797; and with Philadelphia, Beſton, New-York, and ſome other towns, this year. Even, on the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the diſeaſe, we have been congratulated for the uncommon health of the city. Declarations of uncommon health, at this ſeaſon, will, perhaps, hereafter, be looked upon as an omen of diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The publications of the College of Phyſicians, the Board of Health, and the Academy of Medicine, on the ſixth, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and eighth days of Auguſt, produced the moſt ſerious alarm amongſt all claſſes of citizens. Numbers fled, and crouded into the ſurrounding towns and country, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of twenty, thirty, and even fifty miles from the city, to provide refuge for their families and friends. The removals from the city were much more general and more rapid than in 1793. It is probable, that at leaſt twice, if not three times the number of perſons fled this year, as at any former period. Many who had been witneſſes to the diſtreſſes of 1793 and 1797, and appeared then the moſt undaunted, were now the firſt to remove from danger. For the firſt three weeks after the alarm, the ſtreets were crouded with waggons and carts, loaded with goods and furniture. Forty or fifty wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, beſides carts, have been ſeen in their route to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035335_0054_10023239D52AFDB8"/>
in one direction. One ſquare, in the centre of the city, where, in 1793, there removed only about twenty-five perſons, in 1798, there were above one hundred and forty. The diſperſion began about the ſixth and eighth of Auguſt, and, altho' moſt numerous in the two ſucceeding weeks, they continued partially until the middle of September. Many, who at the beginning, when the diſeaſe was confined to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular parts of the city, had adopted the reſolution of ſtaying, and confining themſelves to their houſes, were afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to remove; becauſe, the diſeaſe approached either their doors or neighbourhood. The number who fled from the city have been eſtimated at <hi>three-fourths</hi> to <hi>five-ſixths</hi> of the whole inhabitants: the total number of inhabitants have been eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated at fifty to ſeventy thouſand. We have eſtimated them<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 8.</note> at fifty-five to ſixty thouſand; and we think it probable, that about forty thouſand may have removed from the city.</p>
            <p>In 1793, our citizens complained of inhoſpitality in the country, ariſing principally from the terror created by the novelty of the diſorder. Then it was believed to be as contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the country as in the unfortunate city, which poured forth its fugitives in every direction. It was not, therefore, to be wondered, that our citizens were ſhunned, as if even their approach carried inevitable deſtruction. To repel ſuppoſed dangers, guards were ſtationed, with arms, to ſtop the flight of the wanderers. They were then refuſed the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life; and, in many inſtances, they died for want. Many could not always procure a comfortable lodging. The caſe was rather different this year. An idea, now prevailed, grounded upon the experience of 1793 and 1797, that the diſorder was not communicable in the country; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, there was leſs difficulty made to the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our citizens. Throughout the country, the houſes were generally open for them: accommodations were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at reaſonable rates: the extortions practiſed were few. There were ſome however, ſignalized by avarice.</p>
            <p>Altho' accommodations were generally afforded reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtill the ſufferings of our citizens were very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Many perſons, accuſtomed to ſpacious houſes, and all the comforts and luxuries which Philadelphia could furniſh, were obliged to content themſelves with, perhaps, one ſmall room, wherein two, three or four beds were crouded together; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, in ſome ſituations remote from markets, the fare

was very coarſe; and, in ſome places, not abundant. Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have occurred, of women, in a ſtate of parturition, in bleak, deſolate rooms, almoſt without aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The Health Office was removed from Walnut ſtreet to the City Hall, where it was kept open, night and day. The City-Tavern was ſhut up, and the different public offices, banks, &amp;c. were removed, either to the remoter parts of the city, to Germantown, Trenton, Cheſter, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Meantime, the diſeaſe continued to increaſe, and appeared in parts of the city, remote from where it firſt was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The number of deaths in the city and ſuburbs was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the newſpapers, and publiſhed daily. The returns of the City-Hoſpital were alſo regularly reported; and, after the 15th of Auguſt, a daily report of the new caſes was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, collected from the different phyſicians, by Mr. JOHN JARVIS, who was employed by the Board of Health for that purpoſe. Theſe reports were a index by which the citizens were enabled, with ſome degree of certainty, to judge of its progreſs, extenſion and decline. The arrangements of the Board of Health, for the removal of the ſick, interment of the dead, &amp;c. were judicious and early. They empowered all the regular practiſing phyſicians to grant orders for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the City Hoſpital, and coachees were provided by the Board for that purpoſe.—At the Hoſpital burying-ground, graves were always ready: the grave diggers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained day and night in the yard.—When a perſon died, it was only neceſſary to make application at the Health-Office, where hearſes and coffins were in readineſs to convey the corpſe to the grave. The patients in the City-Hoſpital were placed under the management of Dr. Philip Syng Phyſick, and Dr. Samuel Cooper. They reſided there conſtantly, and were furniſhed with two aſſiſtants;—a competant number of nurſes and attendants, with medicine, and every thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the comfort and relief of the ſick;—nor were the poor, who were ſick in the city, neglected: ſkilful phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians were appointed to attend them, and medicines provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their uſe, at the expenſe of the public. The north part of the city, and the Northern-Liberties, were placed under the care of Dr. Francis Bowes Sayre, Dr. James Meaſe, and Dr. Kinlaid: Southwark, and the ſouth part of the city, were attended by Dr. John Church and Dr. Benjamin Duffield; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In the early period of the calamity, the diſeaſe aſſumed a
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035335_0056_1002324013F16478"/>
more malignant form, than it did in '93 or '97, and very great mortality took place: not <hi>one</hi> in <hi>ſix</hi> caſes now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Several of the phyſicians announced their intention of leaving the city—perhaps, urged by the recollection of the great mortality among phyſicians the year previous.—An idea that it was the plague, and incurable, was generally propagated and believed: Nurſes were with difficulty procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, perhaps from the experience of '97, which proved, that the native blacks were not more exempt from the diſeaſe than the whites.—An almoſt univerſal antipathy to the City Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital prevailed. The terror of being forceably ſent there, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented many from acknowledging their ſickneſs, until they were unable to conceal it; and ſcarcely <hi>one</hi> patient in <hi>ten</hi> would acknowledge that his diſeaſe was the prevailing fever. This operated in producing a delay in calling for medical aſſiſtance, until that period, when it was difficult to overcome it by the power of medicine. A want of confidence likewiſe prevented many from applying to a phyſician for advice. They were convinced, from experience, that in jarring opinions, humanity is often loſt ſight of, by an obſtinate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to error: in the former years, the medical pen was, in many inſtances, dipped in gall. "The ſeveral combatants took their peculiar grounds, and diſdained, in too many caſes, to ſave the life of a human being, by following any other ſuggeſtions than their own. They diſtracted the public mind, and ſhook all confidence in medical aſſiſtance."</p>
            <p>But, the reverſe of this was exhibited this ſeaſon; and it was truly agreeable, to obſerve the harmony that prevailed among the phyſicians in this period of ſickneſs and diſtreſs. They all agreed in adviſing their friends to leave the city; altho' they "<hi>derived</hi>" the diſeaſe from different cauſes. The practiſe of the one, therefore, became more aſſimilated to that of the other.</p>
            <p>The Board of Health, impreſſed with a ſenſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of delaying to apply for medical aid, on the 13th of Auguſt, publiſhed the following recommendation:</p>

                        <p>They recommend, in the moſt earneſt manner, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removal of patients to the City Hoſpital,—where, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic

                        </opener>
                        <p>I am ſorry to diſcover, by your letter, your want of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the treatment of our malignant fever, at the City Hoſpital. I do not wonder at it: you ſeldom ſee the diſeaſe in is firſt ſtage; and, when you do, you meet it in an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſtate, by the motion your patients undergo in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Hoſpital.</p>
                        <p>In anſwer to your requeſt, I have ſat down to inform you of the practice which I have adopted in our preſent epidemic. In the treatment of the yellow fever of laſt year, I have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally lamented the loſs of patients after reducing the pulſe by bleeding, and by the liberal uſe of purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. I have ſuſpected that death occurred in thoſe caſes, from the ſtagnation of acrid bile in the gall-bladder, or its cloſe adherence to the upper bowels, in the manner deſcribed by Dr. Mitchell, in his account of the yellow fever-in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina, in the year 1741. The ſlow pulſe which occurs about the 4th day, I ſuſpect further to be the effect of this bile. Its effects in a much leſs morbid ſtate in the jaundice, in reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pulſe, is well known. Mr. John Hunter ſays, he once met with an inſtance in which it fell to thirty-two ſtrokes in a minute in that diſeaſe. Revolving theſe facts in my mind, I reſolved to try to remove this bile, by exciting an <hi>artificial cholera morbus,</hi> about the 4th day of the fever. I was the more diſpoſed to attempt this method of cure, from believing, as I have done for ſeveral years, that a Cholera Morbus is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the firſt grade of billious fever thrown in upon the bowels, juſt as the Dyſentery and Diarrhoea are the internal forms of a common billious or intermitting fever.</p>
                        <p>I began this mode of treating the fever eights day ago. My ſolicitude for the iſſue of it was very great. Thank God, it has ſucceded to my wiſhes; and thereby leſſoned, in a great degree, the anxiety and diſtreſs which accompany our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon this ferocious diſeaſe. The medicines I uſe for <hi>ſhaking</hi> the gall-bladder and bowels, and <hi>diſcharging</hi> the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035335_0059_10023249D2D14E78"/>
contents are, tartar-emetic, gamboge, jalap and calomel, combined, or given ſeparately, and in ſmall or large doſes, according to circumſtances. Perhaps Turpeth mineral might be added to this liſt of vomiting and purging medicines with advantage. In one caſe, I gave four grains of tartar-emetic, and twenty of calomel. It operated freely upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and brought away a large quantity of green and black bile, but without exciting the leaſt cramp or pain in the ſtomach or bowels. At the time I gave it, death appeared to be creeping upon the patient. The next day he was out of danger. The perſon thus reſcued from the grave, was the ſon of Mr. Richard Renſhaw. Indeed, I have not, as yet, loſt a ſing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e patient to whom I have given this powerful remedy. In one inſtance I fear it will fail. It is in a boy of ſixteen years of age, to whom I have given near thirty grains of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-emetic in the courſe of a few hours, without producing the leaſt evacuation from his ſtomach or bowels. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame increaſe of ſtrength after its operation, that we obſerve after bleeding and purging in the beginning of the fever.</p>
                        <p>Vomits are old remedies in the yellow fever of the Weſt-Indies. I gave them on the firſt day of the diſeaſe in the year 1793, and always without ſucceſs. They uniformly did harm, when given in the beginning of the fever, in its worſt grade, in 1797. The reaſon of this failure in their efficacy, I now perceive was, becauſe they were given before the violent morbid action in the ſyſtem was reduced or moderated by bleeding and purging. After this change is induced in the diſeaſe, they are perfectly ſafe. The time for exhibiting them ſhould be regulated by the pulſe, and other ſymptoms. In moderate caſes of the fever, they are as proper in its firſt ſtage, as on the fourth day. As there is a bliſtering point in all fevers, ſo there appears to be an <hi>emetic point</hi> in the yellow fever. It may occur on the ſecond, and it may be protracted to the ſixth or ſeventh day of the diſeaſe. I have not given the medicine I have mentioned in any caſe where the patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of pain or burning in the ſtomach; but, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered a nauſea, and a moderate degree of puking, as no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to its uſe; for, Dr. Phyſick has taught me by his diſſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that theſe ſymptoms may exiſt without the leaſt infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the ſtomach, and that they have been abſent where the ſtomach has appeared after death to have been highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.</p>
                        <p>The cure of the fever ſhould not reſt upon a ſingle doſe of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035335_0060_1002324DF73DF3D8"/>
the medicine. I have given two doſes of it in a day in ſeveral caſes, and have given it in one caſe, every day for three ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive days.</p>
                        <p>It has often been remarked, that no two epidemics are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly alike. They vary not only in different climates, but in the ſame climate in different years. They even vary with the changes of the weather in the ſame ſeaſon. The fever of 1797 differed in ſeveral particulars from the fever of 1793, and the preſent epidemic differs materially from both. In many of the caſes I have ſeen, it exceeds the fever of laſt year in its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity. Theſe variations in diſeaſes call for correſponding changes in our practice.</p>

            <p>The following remarks, attempting to prove that the diſeaſe is contagious, is taken from the Philadelphia Gazette:</p>
            <p>"The preſent alarming ſituation of our city, is, alas! tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deplorable—almoſt in a general ſtate of infection with a diſeaſe, to whoſe virulence, medicinal ſkill is lamentably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to acknowledge its inferiority! Former experience is rendered, in a great meaſure, uſeleſs, by the very material dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the nature of the diſeaſe.—The moſt copious bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the moſt violent purgatives have been found ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; and the ſucceſs that will attend the new ſyſtem of emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying the gall-bladder, is, at leaſt, problematical. With regard to the opinion of the non-contagion of the diſorder, I have very great reaſon to doubt it. I have known, lately, ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that could not be accounted for upon any other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than that of contagion. The moſt ſtriking of the caſes I allude to, is, where ſeveral of a family, living in a healthy and uninfected part of the city, took the diſorder from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the family, whom they had for ſeveral days cloſely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; without having themſelves been in any part of the city that could even have been ſuppoſed to be infected. I
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035335_0061_1001FEAA448BE8F0"/>
would caution my fellow-citizens not to truſt too implicitly to this fatal opinion, which has been ſo induſtriouſly propagated. A confidence in it, in caſe it ſhould happen to be erroneous, may prove the deſtruction of thouſands, while, by acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a diſbelief of it, and uſing every poſſible precaution, many lives may be preſerved. It is at leaſt doubtful whether it is, or is not, contagious; and there being a doubt, I think the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt courſe to be purſued is obvious: I would adviſe my friends, to avoid, as much as poſſible, expoſing themſelves to the night air, or morning fogs; nothing tending more effectually to prediſpoſe the body to infection."</p>
            <p>Many perſons who had gone into the country for ſafety, were afterwards ſeized with the fever. It is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they had imbibed the contagion before they left the city. In conſequence, the Board of Health, on the 22d of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, authoriſed the phyſicians to receive into the Hoſpital, all ſuch perſons as came from the country. There were now about fifty patients in the Hoſpital: the new caſes amounted to about forty, and the deaths, to above thirty, per day.—The difficulty of procuring nurſes to attend the ſick, induced the Board of Health, to ſolicit ſuch perſons, of good character, as were willing and qualified for that office, to leave their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs at the Health Office; where citizens, who required them, were invited to apply.</p>
            <p>The ſufferings of the poor, and, indeed of many others in middling circumſtances of life, were extreme: deprived, as they were, of all employment, and unable to procure money from thoſe who owed them;—a ſtagnation to trade and other cauſes, rendered them incapable of removing their families to the country; and many of them were almoſt, literally, ſtarving: even the reſources of credit were not left; as there were very few ſtores open, or bakers who remained in town. In this criſis, the Guardians of the Poor liberally ſtepped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and, in junction with the Board of Health, erected tents on the eaſt bank of the river Schuylkill; to which they invited the citizens to remove with their families. There were alſo tents afterwards erected at Maſters' Place, for the ſame laudable purpoſe; and proviſion was made for the relief of the poor in the city, whoſe ſituations prevented them from removing.</p>

                        <p>Impelled by the awful progreſs and unparalleled malignity of the prevailing fever, we are conſtrained to addreſs your feelings, as well as your reaſon, in order to avert the fatal deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, which, with rapid ſtrides, is pervading our ill-fated city and ſuburbs.</p>
                        <p>The beſt ſkill of our phyſicians, and all the powers of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, it muſt be acknowledged, have proved unequal in the conteſt with this devouring poiſon.</p>
                        <p>With the moſt affecting ſympathy, and anxious ſolicitude, we have, to the beſt of our judgments, endeavoured to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, as circumſtances appeared to require, the power and the means entruſted to us, in arreſting its progreſs, and alleviat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its concomitant miſeries. We ſhall continue to employ them with unremitting zeal; but, we have neither the power nor the means to accompliſh ALL THE MEASURES neceſſary to check its extenſion, or provide for the preſſing exigencies of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035335_0063_100232576471F4C0"/>
the moment. The powers delegated, and appropriations made by law, to the inſtitutions under our direction, are impotent, indeed, when compared to the magnitude of the occaſion.</p>
                        <p>It remains for our fellow-citizens to attain, by their energy, the ends, which, alone, can ſtop its progreſs and diminiſh its horrors.</p>
                        <p>We have, in conjunction with the Guardians of the Poor, cauſed tents to be erected on the eaſt bank of the Schuylkill, for the accommodation of the indigent; where near twelve hundred are already provided for, out of the fund appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ordinary relief of the poor. This is but a partial mitigation of the evils which <hi>environ</hi> thouſands who have a claim upon the philanthropy of thoſe who are in more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty of procuring a place of refuge, at preſent, in the country, is too well known; and the expenſe attending the removal of a family, has diſcouraged many from the attempt, who are in circumſtances to live comfortably at home.</p>
                        <p>What remains to be done? Citizens of reſpectability and influence!—come forward, and form yourſelves into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for the purpoſe of erecting, on the weſt bank of the Schuylkill, all the tents that can be collected: let the tents be floored with boards, and made as comfortable as poſſible.—If tents cannot be had, boards, in abundance, may be procured for the erection of ſheds. Admoniſh thoſe citizens who have no place of refuge, to take ſhelter there,—particularly thoſe from the eaſt part of the city, the diſtrict of Southwark, and the Northern Liberties.—In ſhort, ALL who can leave their homes, without manifeſt injury;—except thoſe who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the protection of the city and liberties.</p>
                        <p>The committee ſhould have the general ſuperintendance and regulation of the tents, and authority to preſerve order; contract for certain ſupplies of bread, meat, vegetables, wood, &amp;c. at the loweſt poſſible rates. Thoſe who are not in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to pay, muſt be ſupplied by public bounty.</p>
                        <p>It is at leaſt an unequal, perhaps an unjuſt mode of raiſing money by an appeal to the humanity of generous individuals; but, if on any occaſion, it may be juſtified, the preſent may be aſſumed without heſitation.</p>
                        <p>We call your attention to the actual and undiſguiſed ſtate of our city. Conſider the mortality and rapid increaſe of the ſick at ſo early a period.—View the liſt of your phyſicians, and <hi>mark how few are at their poſts;</hi> and we believe you will think, with us, that the preſervation of health is only to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by flight.</p>

Do not flatter yourſelves, fellow-citizens, that this picture is too highly coloured: we ſpeak from conviction, and a knowledge of facts; and doubt not, but that the lives of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, perhaps of thouſands, may be preſerved, by the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe or ſimilar meaſures.</p>

            <p>Much merit is due to the framer of this elegant, feeling, and pathetic addreſs, which, in a very ample manner, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the contemplated relief.

            <p>The proſpect which the city now afforded was truly deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Accounts, from almoſt every quarter eaſt of Seventh-ſtreet, furniſhed the moſt gloomy pictures of diſeaſe and death. The City Hoſpital contained about 100 ſick perſons, and the daily admiſſions amounted to about 22. One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeven new caſes, and ſixty-ſeven deaths, per day, had been reported<note n="*" place="bottom">See table, at the end of this chapter.</note>—and to add, if poſſible, to the general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, the ſons of rapine and robbery were availing themſelves of the unguarded ſtate of the city, to enhance themſelves by their ignominious plunder. On the night of the 2d of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, the bank of Pennſylvania was opened, and robbed to the amount of <hi>one hundred and ſixty-two thouſand eight hundred and twenty-one dollars and ſixty one cents,</hi> in caſh and notes, the particulars of which we will hereafter relate. Every thing ſeemed to portray ruin and deſolation: even the perſons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to drive the hearſes and coachees, for the conveyance of the ſick, by their bad behaviour, were aiding the maſs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.

                        <p>The following directions for the prevention and treatment of the prevailing fever, are affectionately recommended to thoſe citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Philadelphia, who are unable to procure the regular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and advice of phyſicians, by BENJAMIN RUSH, SAMUEL P. GRIFFITTS. <date>September 3d, 1798.</date>

                        <p>THE ſeeds of the diſeaſe may exiſt in the body, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, without doing any harm. It is generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by one or more of the following cauſes, which of courſe,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035335_0067_1002326672F83F90"/>
ought to be carefully avoided, <abbr>viz.</abbr> fatigue, a long walk, ſtanding in the ſun, or in a current of air, intemperance in eating and drinking, coſtiveneſs, violent paſſions, or ſudden emotions of the mind, thin dreſſed, light bed clothes, and, above all, the night air.</p>
                        <p>It is of conſequence for our citizens to know, that we have but one fever in our city at preſent, and that every febrile indiſpoſition partakes of the prevailing malignant epidemic. Hundreds have died from miſtaking the firſt ſtage of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for a common cold. The miſtake is a natural one; for, it comes on like a cold, and is frequently excited by cool, or cold air. This remark is intended to produce applications for medical aid as ſoon as poſſible after feeling the leaſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of indiſpoſition at the preſent juncture.</p>
                        <p>In the forming ſtate of the fever, when the patient feels ſlightly indiſpoſed, and before he is confined to his bed, the following remedies generally check the diſeaſe:</p>
                        <p>A purge of ſalts, caſtor oil, or a doſe of jalap and calomel. If theſe fail of giving relief, a gentle ſweat ſhould be excited in the uſual way. If there be much pain in the head or back, and the pulſe be full, or tenſe, ten or twelve ounces of blood ſhould be loſt, before the uſe of the ſweat, and either before or after taking the purge. Entire reſt from buſineſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all kinds will be neceſſary to give efficacy to the above remedies.</p>
                        <p>If the exiſtence of the diſeaſe were more early, and more generally admitted, and the remedies which have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, uſed before the fever was completely formed, there are the ſtrongeſt reaſons to believe there would be much leſs mortality from it.</p>
                        <p>After the diſeaſe is formed, and appears with more or leſs of the following ſymptoms, <abbr>viz.</abbr> chills, great heat, head-ache, a redneſs in the eyes, ſickneſs at the ſtomach, vomiting, pains in the back, limbs and bowels, &amp;c. the following remedies are proper.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The loſs of ten or twelve ounces of blood, two or three times a-day, while the pulſe continues to be full, or tenſe. If the pulſe ſhould be ſlower, and apparently weaker than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it calls for bleeding as much as it does when it diſcovers preternatural fulneſs and tenſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The bowels ſhould be purged, at the ſame time, with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel mixed with jalap or rhubarb, in powders or in pills.—The operation of this purging medicine ſhould be aided, when practicable, by clyſters, compoſed of half an ounce of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035335_0068_1001FEADD012FD80"/>
glauber ſalts, diſſolved in half a pint of warm water, or of half a pint of warm water with ſweet oil, molaſſes, and common ſalt, of each a table-ſpoonful, in it.</p>
                        <p>The bowels ſhould be kept gently open through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, by means of the above clyſters, and any other gently purging medicine.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If the ſtomach ſhould be ſick and oppreſſed with bile, a vomit of ipecacuana, or tartar emetic may be given at any time on the 3d or 4th day of the diſeaſe, provided the pulſe has been reduced by previous bleeding and purging. From five to ten drops of laudanum may be given to compoſe the ſtomach if the vomit ſhould operate more than three or four times.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Calomel ſhould be given from the beginning, in doſes of from two to five grains, every two hours, in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a ſalivation. If the calomel ſhould purge more than two or three times a-day, four or five drops of laudanum may be given two or three times a-day, in order to confine the calomel to the bowels, and thereby to determine it to the mouth and throat. We have ſeen no death where this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine has produced a ſalivation.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. After the pulſe is reduced by bleeding and purging, if the diſeaſe has not yielded, a profuſe ſweat ſhould be excited by wrapping the patient up in blankets, with five or ſix hot bricks wetted with vinegar applied to different parts of his body, and giving him at the ſame time large and repeated draughts, of hot camomile or ſage tea, hot lemonade or weak punch, or any other hot liquor that is agreeable to him, to drink. This ſweat ſhould be continued <hi>but</hi> FOUR or FIVE hours at a TIME, and but ONCE in the twenty-four hours. If the patient ſhould become fainty, during the uſe of this excellent remedy, it ſhould be diſcontinued for a few hours, but renewed (under the circumſtances above mentioned) if the diſeaſe ſhould continue.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Bliſters ſhould be applied to the wriſts and ankles, in common caſes, about the third or fourth day of the fever, if the pulſe be reduced, or the ſickneſs at ſtomach is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. If the head be much affected, a bliſter ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the neck or to the crown of the head, firſt cutting off the hair and ſhaving it, and if the ſtomach ſhould be much affected after the third or fourth day a large bliſter ſhould be applied to it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. In caſe of delirium with a languid pulſe, poultices of raw garlic, with a little muſtard, ſhould be applied to the feet,</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <pb n="70" facs="unknown:035335_0069_10023268C6B75858"/>
8. Freſh air ſhould be admitted into ſick rooms at all times, and cool air in the beginning of the fever, when the ſkin is hot, and the pulſe full and tenſe. In this ſtate of the fever, the hands, feet and face ſhould be waſhed, ten or twelve times a-day, with cold water. In a cool ſtate of the ſkin, or when the body is covered with ſweat, cool air and cold water are improper.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The body and bed linen of the ſick ſhould be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed, and all offenſive matters, diſcharged from them, ſhould be inſtantly removed.</p>
                        <p>In caſes of great weakneſs, the patient ſhould not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to riſe from his bed when under the operation of purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing phyſic, nor upon any other occaſion.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The drinks of ſick people, in the beginning of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhould be toaſt and water, tamarind water, lemonade, currant jelly, diſſolved in water, apple water or barley water. In the latter ſtage of the fever, the drinks may be porter and water, claret and water, milk and water, or camomile tea.</p>
                        <p>Weak tea and coffee may be taken in the beginning of the fever. In its ſecond ſtage, the patient may eat bread and milk, with roaſted apples, or ſoft peaches, chocolate, ſago, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pioca, ripe fruits, weak chicken or veal broth, and a little boiled chicken.</p>
                        <p>It will be improper to depend excluſively upon any one of the above remedies. The combined force of them, all is barely ſufficient, in many caſes, to overcome this formidable diſeaſe.</p>

                           <hi>How to eſcape the Yellow-Fever, now prevalent in Philadelphia:</hi> Addreſſed particularly to thoſe citizens whoſe circumſtances will not permit them to comply with the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Managers of the Marine and City Hoſpitals.</p>
                        <p>The fever, which at this time prevails in our unfortunate city and ſuburbs, is the very ſame, in kind, as that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in '93 and '97, occaſioned by imported contagion, and was introduced into it, for want of efficient health-laws, and the proper regulation of quarantines, as I propoſe to make appear in a future paper.</p>
                        <p>This contagion, however, appears, from numerous obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and the moſt authentic facts, to be capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing fever, only under <hi>particular</hi> circumſtances: theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035335_0070_1002326A54562570"/>
removed or avoided, the contagion becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active and harmleſs.</p>
                        <p>This fever had not been obſerved to exiſt in Philadelphia, for more than thirty years, before the year '93—and has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been known to exiſt in the winter ſeaſon in this climate; differing in this reſpect, from thoſe contagious fevers that are bred in jails, hoſpitals and priſon ſhips; but perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the plagues which have been introduced at different times into different maritime towns in Europe from certain parts of Africa, and the Turkiſh dominions in Europe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon Aſia.</p>
                        <p>The circumſtances which render the contagion of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever active, and favour its ſpreading or becoming epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, appear to be, hot, rarified and ſtagnant, or confined air, more eſpecially when replete and altered in its ſalutary quality by putrid exhalations from dead vegetable and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſubſtances. Under the recited circumſtances, the majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe who approach very near to, or come in contact with the ſick, ſo as to receive the exhalations emitted by the lungs or ſkin, become in the courſe of a few days, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly on the fifth or ſixth day after ſuch expoſure, affected with the ſame kind of fever; but as all that approach within the ſame diſtance to the ſick, do not afterwards take the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, though they have received the contagious particles into their bodies, it implies that their conſtitutions are not diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to favour its operation; that is, that they are poſſeſſed of a power to reſiſt its action or impreſſion, or that the contagion mixing with the fluids in the ſtomach, or with thoſe in the arteries, paſſes out again, with ſome of the uſual excretions.</p>
                        <p>The circumſtances, which, in moſt caſes, appear to give ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to the contagion, ſo as to produce fever, after it has been received into the circulation, through the medium of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, lungs or ſkin, appear to be ſuch as have the power of inducing ſudden and great debility in the ſeveral functions of the body, and conſequent ſpaſm or conſtriction of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme veſſels, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Among the chief of theſe, may be reckoned, ſudden expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to cold, after great fatigue, or after being greatly heated by exerciſe, and expoſure to the ſcorching rays of the ſun.</p>
                        <p>Intemperance, ſucceeded by abſtinence, frequent blood let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, purging, faſting, and conſtant terror or dread of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, have all a ſimilar effect. Whereas, moderate and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exerciſe, the temperate uſe of ſuch nouriſhing food as has no tendency to ſtimulate or inflame, and rather to preſerve
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035335_0071_1002326F30235570"/>
the bowels laxative than otherwiſe, and the temperate uſe of diluted fermented liquors, particularly found bottled porter and claret, have the moſt ſalutary effect in preventing the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the contagion, and alſo of rendering the diſeaſe milder and more manageable by the phyſician, when it does attack, than when it occurs in thoſe previouſly debilitated.</p>
                        <p>The air in the open ſtreets, I believe, never becomes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently contaminated by the contagious particles (let the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients be ever ſo numerous in the houſes) to communicate the diſeaſe to any perſon walking in the middle of the ſtreet, or even on the pavements, when the wind blows from the oppoſite ſide. This is a fact not only confirmed by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the judicious and accurate Dr. Ruſſel, in his account of a peſtilential fever at Aleppo, and by all the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians that have publiſhed an account of the diſeaſe, as it has appeared in different parts of Europe, but is alſo eſtabliſhed by the events of laſt year, and by thoſe of '93.</p>
                        <p>In the year '93, all the priſoners in the jail of Philadelphia, amounting to more than 200; the priſoners in the almſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; and the patients in the Pennſylvania hoſpital, eſcaped the diſeaſe, owing to the precaution of preventing the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any ſick or ſuſpicious perſon, as well as every infected article into thoſe places.</p>
                        <p>All the families, alſo, that remained in the city and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined themſelves and their domeſtics ſtrictly to their own houſes, and ſuffered no ſick perſon, or any one lately recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the diſorder, or any material from an infected houſe, to come near them; and employed ſome truſty perſon to furniſh them with marketing and other neceſſaries, from ſources free from infection, eſcaped the diſeaſe without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. This was alſo the caſe with all the farmers that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the market, that cautiouſly avoided ſleeping at, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into any of the chambers of the taverns, or places where they put up. This could not have been the caſe, if the whole atmoſphere of the city had been tainted, or replete with noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exhalations.</p>
                        <p>By obſerving the preceding rules and cautions, therefore, thoſe inhabitants who cannot procure a retreat in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may certainly preſerve themſelves from taking the fever.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are conſolatory facts, drawn from experienced ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers; and they are facts that may be fitly oppoſed to the popular notions of contagion, ſo apt to affect the imagination in moments of conſternation and diſmay.</p>
                        <p>Before I conclude, I think it proper to add, that I have
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035335_0072_1002327315411DC8"/>
frequently ſeen perſons, whoſe office it is to attend the ſick, eſcape the diſeaſe in large airy apartments, without obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any precaution at all; but have ſeldom obſerved this to be the caſe in ſmall confined places unfavourable for ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially where the circumſtances of the patient, would not admit of daily changes of the bed and body linen. Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, daily changes of apparel, and free ventilation appear, therefore, to be eſſential for preventing the contagious and malignant effects of the fever.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps if phyſicians and nurſes were ſtudiouſly to guard againſt breathing when near the patient, and were never to ſwallow their ſaliva; (by which it is probable the contagion is more frequently conveyed into the body than by any other means) were careful to rince their mouths with cold water and vinegar, brandy and water or wine, and frequently to chew ſome agreeable aromatic ſubſtance; were never to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the ſick with an empty ſtomach, and were to rub half a drachm or a drachm of mercurial ointment upon their limbs every night till it occaſioned tenderneſs of the mouth, it would prevent the contagion from operating, or at leaſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſeaſe much more mild and manageable when it did occur.</p>

            <p>About the 12th or 14th of September, the diſeaſe began to appear among the convicts in the criminals' jail. One died on the 17th, and two more on the 18th, and ſeveral were lying ſick. In conſequence of which, the vagrant and untried
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035335_0075_1001FEB97052E150"/>
criminals, male and female, were removed to Morris's Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. The whole number of priſoners in the jail, at this time, including debtors, was about three hundred.</p>
            <p>On the 18th, ſeveral of them attempted to make their eſcape by force, in abſence of the jailor. Perhaps they were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led to this raſh act, to avoid the contagion which was then raging in the jail, and perhaps becauſe there was little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being taken, from the unprotected ſtate of the city. But, in this project, they were fruſtrated, by the undaunted vigilance of Robert Wharton, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> then one of the alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the city, now mayor, with a few aſſiſtants; two of the criminals were ſhot, and one wounded with a bayonet before the reſt ſurrendered.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the above proceedings, and the ſeveral robberies, which had been committed; a number of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens formed themſelves into an aſſociation, for the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the city, during this deſerted and unprotected period. Their proceedings will be noticed in the next chapter.</p>
            <p>The Board of Health, in order to remove, if poſſible, the averſion retained againſt the City Hoſpital, and to induce the ſick, who were deſtitute of the conveniencies which their ſituation required, to conſent to be taken to the Hoſpital, publiſhed the following comparative ſtatement between the mortality at the City Hoſpital, and that of the City and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties:</p>

            <p>They met at the Senate Chamber, in the State Houſe, on the Mondays, Wedneſdays, and Fridays, of each week, from three to ſix o'clock in the afternoon; where they invited the indigent to apply for relief, and to bring with them certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates from one or more reſpectable inhabitants, to evidence that their families were in ſuch a ſituation as to render it improper to remove to the tents.</p>
            <p>About the 21ſt of September, the fever firſt appeared in the Pennſylvania Hoſpital. It is ſuppoſed to have been introduced by one of the nurſes, who brought ſome clothes from the city a few days previous.</p>
            <p>The repeated robberies and thefts, induced the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to double the number of ordinary watchmen; who, in junction with the patrols, appointed by the citizens, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to guard the city both day and night.</p>
            <p>On the 22d of September, a number of the members of the ſociety of Friends held their annual meeting; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, on account of the fever, till December. About fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Friends, from different parts of the country, attended this meeting. Of theſe, ſeventeen were ſoon after attacked with the fever, twelve of whom died. The majority were attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within five days after leaving the city, tho' many of them reſided here but one, and others only two days.</p>
            <p>About the end of September and the beginning of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the diſeaſe attained to its criſis. The greateſt number of new caſes, reported in one day, during the whole period of the calamity, was, <hi>one hundred and twenty-ſeven.</hi> This was on the 7th of September. On the 21ſt, there were one hundred and twenty-ſix new caſes reported. On the 19th of September, thirty-two ſick perſons were admitted into the City Hoſpital; and, on the 26th of the ſame month, ſixteen died. Theſe were the greateſt number of admiſſions and deaths that occurred. The higheſt number of patients, remaining in the Hoſpital, was 164. This was on the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035335_0078_100232957B42FD70"/>
22d of Sept. On the evening and night of the 27th, there was a great fall of rain, which ſuddenly cooled the air. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, in conſequence of this, the mortality on the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day was greater than at any other period of the fever. One hundred and ſix perſons were interred.</p>
            <p>By comparing the tables of new caſes, and of mortality, &amp;c. as annexed, with the regiſter of the weather, it will be found, that both new caſes and deaths were augmented in conſequence of either rainy, damp, or ſudden cool weather; but, that in a day or two afterwards, both were diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>About the 24th of September, the following hand-bill, without either date or ſignature, was publiſhed, diſtributed and poſted up throughout the City and Liberties:</p>

                        <p>FELLOW-CITIZENS! reflect upon your danger before it is too late. One hundred of us are attacked with the fever every day. One half of that number is daily carried to the grave. If we remain in town, it is probable that the fever will continue five or ſix weeks longer; and, by that time, one-half of our number will have been ſick!—and one-fourth of us will be no more!</p>
                        <p>How different is the ſituation of our friends in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and in the tents!</p>
                        <p>Two thouſand perſons in the tents have loſt but ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen in twenty-five days, while the ſame number in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia have loſt one hundred and ſeventy-eight.</p>

                        <p>The weather, ſince the 6th inſt. has been extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable, and the number of the ſick have conſiderably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; which would evidently be augmented by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of perſons, particularly thoſe from a pure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere.

It was doubtleſs in conſequence of this, that both the new caſes and deaths ſuſtained an increaſe. Many paragraphs appeared in the newſpapers, diſſuading the citizens from returning, until the

               <p>Summary of the proceedings at the City Hoſpital—Encampments on the Schuylkill, and Maſters's place—Aſſociation for the protection of the city—Robbery of the bank—Proceedings in the jail—and at different parts of the union, during the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAVING, in the preceding pages, traced the riſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and decline of the diſeaſe, we now proceed, in a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary manner, to mention ſome occurrences, which could not be previouſly noticed, without interfering with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral connection of ſubject.</p>
            <p>The moſt important proceedings of the Board of Health, we have thought proper to notice, as they are replete with information to the various ſtages of the calamity.—No claſs or body of men were of more ſervice to the city, throughout the whole gloomy period, than theſe individuals.<note n="*" place="bottom">The members who remained at their poſts, and who merit the gratitude of the public, are recorded in page 63. It includes the whole Board, except Meſſrs. John Newbold, and James Wood. After the eſtabliſhment of tents at Maſters's place, Mr. John Inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eep preſided there.</note> Their indefatigable exertions—their arrangements in the city, and at the City Hoſpital, with thoſe of the Overſeers and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the poor, for alleviating diſtreſs, were judicious and ſalutary. It was the general cuſtom of the Board to meet and deliberate every morning at 11 o'clock. They framed the regulations for the management of the City Hoſpital, and ſaw that they were properly executed. Meſſrs. William Jones, William Dawſon, and (previous to his death) Iſaac Price, were the members who moſt frequently viſited the Hoſpital for this purpoſe. The burial of the dead was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conducted by the regulations of the Board: they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided coffins, hearſes, &amp;c. Moſt of the coffins (rough pine boxes) were made in the jail by convicts. In the height of the diſeaſe, the deaths were ſo numerous, that the Board found it neceſſary to employ common carts: the number of
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035335_0082_1001FE87036E1128"/>
hearſes were inadequate; and even, with this aſſiſtance, they were frequently under the neceſſity of conveying the dead to the grave in the ſame coachees which carried the ſick to the Hoſpital. Two, and even three bodies were often car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together: about twelve hearſes and carts, and three coachees, were in conſtant employ. An improvement was made, for the more eaſy conveyance of the ſick patients, in the advanced ſtage of their ſickneſs. They could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, without injury, in the coachees. The Board cauſed three ſwing carriages to be made, by which the ſick could lay at their whole length in a bed, ſuſpended from the ſhafts, between the wheels. Thus, they were conveyed with ſuch eaſe, as ameliorated ſome of the former conſequent diſtreſſes, without being diſturbed by the jolting of the carriage. The carriages, with horſes, ſtood always ready, in the <hi>old</hi> Potter's Field.</p>
            <p>For the receipts and expenditures of the Board, together with a ſketch of their proceedings, as detailed in their letter to the governor, <hi>ſee appendix, page XXV.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The City Hoſpital ſtands on a low, flat piece of ground, on the eaſt bank of the Schuylkill, in Saſſafras-ſtreet; with a tract of marſhy ground in front: The ſituation cannot be healthy. Formerly it was occupied for a tavern, when the ſummer-houſes, in the garden, were erected.—The build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for the accommodation of the ſick, conſiſt of two large frame houſes: their form is an oblong ſquare, two ſtories high. The largeſt was erected, during the prevalence of the laſt calamity, when the other was inadequate to contain the number of ſick. The ſummer-houſes were covered with canvaſs, and a few ſmall ſheds were erected for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeſcent. There are alſo ſtables and other out-houſes.—The management of the hoſpital was entruſted to the phyſicians, a ſteward and a matron, under the inſpection of the Board of Health. It was opened for the reception of the ſick about the 8th of Auguſt. They were placed under the care of Drs. Phyſick and Cooper; gentlemen, eminent for medical ſkill and goodneſs of heart.—They made a voluntary offer of their ſervices to the Board.—There Dr. Cooper died, a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim to the contagion, much regretted. Dr. Ruſh aſſiſted as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting phyſician, and Drs. May and Watt were appointed to compound the medicines, &amp;c. From the 6th of September, and to the 6th of October, there were never leſs than one hundred patients in the Hoſpital, nor more than one hundred and ſixty-four.—Medicine, fruit, wine, changes of linen, and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035335_0083_10023181B02A1FB8"/>
every other article, neceſſary for relief, comfort, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, were amply provided.</p>
            <p>The ſcenes of diſtreſs which the Hoſpital exhibited, were truly diſmal:—there we could hear the groans—the moan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings—and the heavy ſighs of "the hundreds ſick." No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions were near to view their diſtreſs, or to ſoothe, with the tear of friendſhip, their "little hour." When the coachees, which brought out the ſick, arrived, often might be ſeen an affrightened patient enter, ſupported by ſtrange Nurſes, and bedewing his or her cheeks with tears. The nurſes were often obliged to hold the patient in bed by force, when ſtruggling with delirium, and others ſeemed to ſleep out their life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any feeling, while the ſcreams of many were heard at a diſtance. Some bled from the mouth and noſe, and the black vomit iſſued, in ſtreams, from others. Two, and frequently three, were placed in one coffin.</p>
            <p>The men and women occupied different wards. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar attention was paid by the nurſes to the ſick, both day and night.—No complaints have been made; but letters of thanks have frequently been ſent to the phyſicians and managers for kind treatment and attention.</p>
            <p>Few of the nurſes at the Hoſpital were attacked with the diſeaſe, although expoſed to concentrated contagion. It was often cuſtomary for them to ſleep on the ſame bed with the ſick, and ſome have been known to ſwallow a portion of the juices of the ſick, without experiencing any injury.—Dr. Phyſick informed us, that he has frequently ſeen a nurſe helping a patient to a ſpoonful of food, and taking another, herſelf, alternately: that he has alſo ſeen them eat the fruit that has been gnawed by the ſick. One or two inſtances occurred of wives nurſing their huſbands in the Hoſpital, and mothers their children; none of which took the diſeaſe, tho' lying on the ſame bed. During the whole period of the ſickneſs, there were 899<note n="*" place="bottom">See the tables of daily returns.</note> perſons admitted into the Hoſpital, of which 518 died.</p>
            <p>The City Hoſpital burial-ground, was the general recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle for the dead, from the beginning of Auguſt to the firſt of November. Graves were dug, at the commencement of the calamity, for every corpſe; but, afterwards, two or three were put into one pit. The accumulated mortality, which commenced about the end of Auguſt, rendered this mode
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035335_0084_10023184C282CE98"/>
impracticable. A more expeditious method of interment was adopted. A large trench was dug, in which the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins were piled upon each other. It was conducted in ſuch a manner, that the freſh mould, dug from one end, covered the dead in another; while the hearſes were drove to the bottom of the trench, where they depoſited the bodies. In two of theſe trenches, upwards of fifteen hundred were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred; twelve or fourteen diggers were employed. They remained, as obſerved before, in the field, night and day. Sheds were conſtructed for their accommodation. Some were buried in this ground, who are not mentioned in our liſt. It was not unfrequent for the grave-diggers to find a dead body in the morning, which had been thrown over the fence during the preceding night.</p>
            <p>After moſt of the citizens, whoſe circumſtances would permit, had fled to the country, the poor began, generally, to ſuffer, and the diſeaſe ſuſtained no abatement. It rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſpread, and little hope remained that it would ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, until it ſhould be deſtroyed by froſt. A removal of the healthy was the only hope left for its mitigation. The Board of Health, in junction with the Guardians of the Poor, concerted meaſures for the conſtruction of temporary tents. Theſe were ſoon afterwards erected on the banks of Schuyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill, between Spruce and Cheſnut-ſtreets. They were ready by the 24th of Auguſt, where fugitives crouded. A certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate was neceſſary, to gain admiſſion, from ſome reſpectable citizen, with an application to any of the following gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were appointed a joint committee from the Board of Health and Guardians of the Poor to ſuperintend this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment: Peter Mierken, Iſaac Price, James Oldden, John Kehr.</p>
            <p>They crouded, in the greateſt abundance, from the ſouth parts of the City and Southwark: They were accommodated with every neceſſary of life, principally from the donations of the opulent. The tents were made of canvaſs, and floored with boards. Here nineteen hundred and fifty perſons were fed, and ſome of them cloathed! While we admire the liberality of the public, which was diſplayed on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we are induced to mention, that in many inſtances, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages were taken. Many ſordid ſouls removed, and were fed and cloathed, who poſſeſſed independent reſources. The names of freeholders, who hold property to the amount of ſeveral thouſands of dollars, could be mentioned, who here
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035335_0085_10023186518AD070"/>
robbed the poor of their pittance. The liberal hand muſt move reluctant, under an idea of ſuch a diabolical practice. Credit is due to the committee who ſuperintended this eſtabliſhment, for both their attention and trouble. The rules which they fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med were judicious, and well adapted to the ſituation and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of each claſs. Some, as might naturally be ſuppoſed, were not the moſt orderly; ſuch were either ſent to Morris's Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or confined in a temporary priſon, at the encampment. Guards were ſtationed with arms, to preſerve order, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any individuals from treſpaſſing the rules. Schools, for the inſtruction of children, were inſtituted; at which 137 male, and 143 female children, attended. The hearty men were employed, in digging the canal. Public worſhip was performed on Sundays; and medical advice, and attendance was given by Dr. S. Duſſield.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of November, the committee were in need of cloathing for infants. They publiſhed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>

            <p>About the beginning of September, another encampment was erected at Maſters' Place, near the Mill-Pond, on the road to Germantown, about two miles from the city, for the ſame benevolent purpoſe as that on the Schuylkill; to which the fugitives, principally from the Northern-Liberties and Kenſington, flocked. John Inſkeep, Jonathan Robeſon, and Iſaac W. Morris, were appointed a committee for its ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendance. It was compoſed of wooden ſheds, comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, convenient, and, in every reſpect, adapted to the occaſion; eſpecially when it is conſidered that they were erected in eight or ten days, and accommodated upwards of <hi>two thouſand perſons.</hi> Beſides the lodging-ſheds, there were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an hoſpital, a large ſtore-houſe, and office, a bake-houſe and oven, and five kitchens, with eight large fire-places. This encampment was ſituated on a well-choſen ſpot, and laid out in regular order: the ſtreets interſected each other. The rules and regulations, which were printed and poſted up in different places in the encampment, do honour to the committee. Spirituous liquors were prohibited, except in caſes of ſuppoſed neceſſity. Slight offences were puniſhed, by withholding proviſions for a reaſonable time; and, for thoſe of a more aggravated nature, the offender was expelled. All
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035335_0087_1002318CD3105730"/>
intercourſe with the city was cut off, except on urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This was enforced, by placing centinels, at proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, around the encampment. Scavengers were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoſe duty it was, every morning, to remove all the filth, and to throw freſh earth into the neceſſaries; and, in every other reſpect, the utmoſt attention was paid to cleanlineſs. They were abundantly ſupplied with proviſions of every kind; the arrangement for the delivery of the rations was well plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the moſt ſcrupulous regard to juſtice obſerved in the diſtribution. The decorum, which was ſo eminently maintained in the encampment, amongſt characters, too, ſome of which were not the moſt amiable, reflect great honour both on the ſuperintendants, and the example of many virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous families, who reſided there. The firſt public addreſs of the ſuperintendants was on the 10th of September: they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the public, that they ſtood in need of vegetables, ſtraw, &amp;c. for the uſe of the diſtreſſed citizens, who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken refuge there; and they hoped that they would experience the ſame liberality which had been extended to the Schuylkill encampment; having the ſame laudable object in view. This public intimation produced an abundant ſupply. On the 28th of the ſame month, the committee publicly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the liberality which they had experienced, ſurpaſſed all expectation: that ſeveral villages and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoods in New-Jerſey, had been eminently bountiful on this occaſion; that the ſupplies which they had occaſionally received, had been abundant, <hi>except in articles of cloathing:</hi> they had received ſome very handſome donations in that line; but not in ſufficient abundance to ſupply their preſſing and numerous wants: that the number, under their care, was daily encreaſing, and already amounted to upwards of <hi>thirteen hundred perſons,</hi> compoſed of both ſexes, from one hour to eighty years old; but, that the greater proportion of them, were helpleſs women and children. About two hundred of the children were at the breaſt, the mothers of whom were generally without ſhoe or ſtocking. The committee ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that linſey, flannels, and woollen ſtockings, would be particularly acceptable, as well as every deſcription of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-hand and ready-made cloathing. From this period, the liſts of donations ſwelled with individual bounty. Our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens ſeemed to vie with each other who ſhould be the moſt liberal. Drs. Currie and Dewees, gratuitouſly offered their ſervices to the committee. Great attention and care was beſtowed upon the ſick in this encampment, which
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035335_0088_1002318F27727708"/>
was numerous. A few had the yellow fever. Theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men received a public declaration of thanks from the committee.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of this encampment returned to their homes, generally, about the 1ſt of November; but not before they had publiſhed a grateful and affectionate tribute of laudable praiſe to their meritorious committee.</p>

            <p>There were about two thouſand and twenty-four perſons ſupplied at this encampment from the 15th and 20th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember to the 1ſt of November.</p>
            <p>It is a melancholy truth, that the moſt awful afflictions which befal our fellow-creatures, are not ſufficient to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in ſome minds, even the feelings of ſympathy. Callous to every ſentiment of humanity, and dead to every principle of virtue, ſome wretches, who, to the eternal diſgrace of the human character, were ſo totally depraved, that while walking even "in the valley of the ſhadow of death," medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and committed the moſt abominable crimes. While every virtuous mind was filled with ſympathetic ſorrow for that general gloom, which hovered over the city, there were vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains lurking about, watching every opportunity, during the abſence of the citizens, to commit robbery on their deſerted houſes. Notwithſtanding that the number of ordinary watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had been augmented, and patrols appointed to watch it during the day, ſeveral robberies were committed. The bank of Pennſylvania, as obſerved before, was robbed; and attempts were made by the priſoners in the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals jail to eſcape. A conſideration of theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and the general unguarded ſtate of the city, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a number of private citizens, to aſſociate for the purpoſe of affording it better protection.</p>

            <p>The aſſociation informed the public, that their intentions were merely to have a body of men ready to turn out, armed and equipped, on any ſudden emergency, or to mount guard at any of the priſons, or elſewhere, if neceſſary; by thus being ready with arms and ammunition, to repair, at the firſt notice, to their reſpective alarm poſts, that they might act with the greateſt promptitude and efficiency, and that the civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates and other good citizens might know where to find a body of men, prepared, to enforce a due obedience to the laws, and preſerve order and tranquility.</p>
            <p>The citizens were informed that in caſes of fire, or riot in the city, the <hi>old</hi> Potter's-Field was choſen as the alarm poſt, or rallying point, from its central ſituation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity to both jails and Morris's Building, then the place of confinement for vagrants; in the Northern Liberties, the city-hall or town-houſe; and in Southwark, Little's ſchool houſe, to which all the members of the aſſociation were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair equipped, and there await the orders or preſence of their own officers, a magiſtrate, or other civil officer.</p>
            <p>The alarm was to be given by firing a field piece.</p>

                        <head>Robbery of the Bank of Pennſylvania.</head>
                        <p>On the night of the 4th of Auguſt, ſome villains entered the bank, and made an unſucceſsful attempt to force open the doors of the caſh vault, and to pick the lock of an iron cheſt; but the inſtitution ſuſtained no loſs; as it was apprehended that the attempt would be renewed, and conſidering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecurity of the building, and the impoſſibility of making ſuch repairs to it as would render it ſafe, the porters were armed, and directed to ſleep in the banking-houſe, in order to guard againſt the ſucceſs of future attempts. The immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the bank to Carpenter's-hall was propoſed. This building, from its conſtruction, and the improvements which had been made to it, when in the occupancy of the Bank of the United States, was thought perfectly ſecure; but previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the removal, which took place on the Saturday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, a new patent lock was put to the outer door, and two
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035335_0090_100231BA491E8C88"/>
iron doors were fitted to the caſh vault, with locks which had been uſed for the book vault, and which were of a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction than any which could at that time be procured in the city. The precaution of obliging the porters to ſleep in the Bank was continued, and the watchmen were charged to be particularly vigilant.</p>
                        <p>Thomas Cunningham, the porter, who is ſince dead, ſlept there alone, and early in the morning of Sunday the 2d of September, Mr. Anneſley, the runner, having occaſion to go to the Bank, found the back door of the banking houſe open; and looking into the banking room, he diſcovered the doors of the back vault likewiſe open. He immediately rouſed Cunningham, who was aſleep up ſtairs; they found all the windows ſecured, the back door unbarred, and the doors of the caſh vault unlocked. Upon an examination of the houſe, it was found that the locks had been opened by falſe keys, for no injury was done to the wards of any of them, nor was there any appearance of force having been uſed.</p>
                        <p>The loſs which the inſtitution had ſuſtained, amounted to <hi>one hundred and ſixty-two thouſand eight hundred and twenty-one dollars and ſixty-one cents.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Every exertion was made to diſcover the perpetrators of this flagrant robbery. Advertiſements were publiſhed throughout the United States, cautioning the public againſt the receipt of the poſt-notes ſtolen. Conſiderable rewards were offered for the apprehenſion of thoſe concerned in the robbery, in addition to that of <hi>one thouſand dollars,</hi> promiſed in the governor's proclamation. "Several perſons were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted upon ſuſpicion, and amongſt thoſe was Patrick Lyon, the ſmith, who was employed in fitting the iron doors of the caſh vault, <hi>and without whoſe privity it is believed this robbery has not been committed.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>After unceaſing vigilance they had the ſatisfaction to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the perpetrator of this daring robbery, ſo that the whole amount of the property ſtolen was recovered, except about three thouſand two hundred dollars.</p>
                        <p>One Iſaac Davis, a carpenter, had an account open in this bank: The firſt circumſtance which excited ſuſpicions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, was a depoſit of 16,000 dollars. Enquiry was made reſpecting his circumſtances and character, which were found to be ſuch, as to induce the officers of the bank to watch his conduct. On the 17th of November, he made another depoſit of 3,910 dollars. The ſuſpicions were now increaſed, and it was thought proper to enquire at the other
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035335_0091_100231BC0DF833D0"/>
banks, whether he had made any depoſits with them? when ſuch information was obtained, as left no doubt but that he was the robber. He was then apprehended, and, partly by threats, and partly by promiſe of an interceſſion with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor for his pardon, the confeſſion of his guilt was extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him.</p>
                        <p>His diſcloſures criminated only Thomas Cunningham, the late porter, and himſelf; for, he repeatedly declared, that they alone were concerned in the robbery. It was remarked, that Thomas Cunningham ſlept in the bank the night that the robbery was committed, and that he was taken ill of the yellow fever the day after and died in the courſe of the week. Davis ſaid that they had divided the money ſtolen, and that the depoſits he had made in the different banks, were part of his ſhare. He aſſured them that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned all he was poſſeſſed of, and that the remainder of the property ſtolen, would be found at the houſe where Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham died. They ſearched the houſe deſcribed, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs. Davis was informed that unleſs he made a full diſcloſure, he would be committed to priſon, and his houſe ſearched: By threats and promiſes, he acknowledged that he had viſited Cunningham the day he was taken ill, and had received from him the remainder of the money ſtolen, a great part of which he had ſtill ſecreted. They had then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in all 158<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Davis declared that the plan of the robbery originated with Cunningham, who procured the falſe keys, and that he does not know who made them.</p>
                        <p>The tenor of this is taken from the report of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, of the State Aſſembly, who were appointed-to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry on the ſubject. They received their information from the officers of the bank. The attempt on the 4th of Auguſt, and the robbery on the 1ſt September, were ſuppoſed to be committed by the ſame perſons. It does not appear evident that Cunningham, the porter, had any concern in the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery. He was found aſleep in the bank next morning; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his conduct nor countenance diſcovered the leaſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of guilt, even to make him ſuſpected. None of the money was found with him, when he died. No evidence but that of Davis, appears to criminate him; and his death prevents his pleading in his own defence. It is not uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in criminal caſes, for the innocent to ſuffer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the guilty: That Mr. Lyon, who fitted the doors

            <p>A convict, named Bradley, was the firſt perſon attacked in the criminals' jail. He was confined in a cell. At this time, it raged in an alley that runs from Fifth-ſtreet, near to the jail-wall, oppoſite to the cells; from whence it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have reached Bradley, whoſe window it fronted.—He was removed on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of September, and died in a few hours after. From him, the diſeaſe communicated to other priſoners; the number of which, including debtors, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to upwards of three hundred. Shortly afterwards, the vagrants, and priſoners confined for petty offences, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Morris's-Buildings, and the debtors to Norriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town: The convicts, amounting to about one hundred and ſixty, and untried of priſoners, near an hundred, then, only, remained in gaol. Mr. Smith, the Jailor, on the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the diſeaſe, became alarmed. He relinquiſhed his charge on the 8th of September, and removed to the country. Robert Wharton, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>, a vigilant and active magiſtrate, now mayor of our city, then aſſumed it. He reſided there, and performed all the duties of jailor, until ſhortly after the 17th of September, when he was aſſiſted by Mr. Peter Helm; who, afterwards, took upon himſelf the charge. The ſervices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rendered by Mr. Helm, during the calamity in 1793, when he preſided at Ruſh-Hill-Hoſpital, and in 1797, when he ſuperintended the City-Hoſpital, at the Wigwam, together with his ſervices this year, juſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to thanks. He was active in theſe different capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and zealouſly and undauntedly run into danger—but, the palm ſeems to reſt upon other characters: Like the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock in the fable, which other birds wiſhed to vie with, ſome have been plucking his feathers.</p>
            <p>After Mr. Helm took charge of the jail, he reſided there day and night—watched the convicts, and attended the ſick, alternately. Some of the keepers left the jail ſhortly after
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035335_0093_100231DB27F7B468"/>
Mr. Smith. Others were taken ſick. Their places were ſupplied by conſtables, &amp;c. The ſick priſoners were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Dr. Benjamin Duffield. He cauſed every humane and ſalutary meaſure to be adopted for their accommodation. They were removed from the healthy, to a ward in the eaſt wing, which was converted into an hoſpital. The convaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents were kept in a ſeparate apartment. Strict attention was paid to cleanlineſs, for the better ſecurity againſt the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the diſeaſe. The green wood was removed from the yard; all rubbage and putrifiable materials, were carried off: The obſtructed water-channel was cleared: The pavement was frequently waſhed, and kept wet and cool, by means of the pump; and the ſleeping wards, were, as uſual, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ventilated. To theſe precautions, which were adopted by direction of Mr. Caleb Lownes, with their ſimple healthy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and the entire prohibition of every kind of liquor, is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to be aſcribed, the ſucceſsful eſcape of ſo large a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the priſoners. The diſeaſe ſpread through every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the jail. <hi>'Dutch Hannah',</hi> a convict, was the firſt vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim in the weſt wing, where the females are kept. Several of the convicts voluntarily offered their ſervices as nurſes, and attended the ſick with tenderneſs and attention. One John Brown was the firſt that made this laudable offer.—He was taken ſick, and died. There were, in all, forty-four caſes in the jail; of which, twenty-ſeven paid their laſt debt to Nature. Nine were ſent to the City-Hoſpital; two of which, only, recovered. Thirty-five were attended in jail; twenty of theſe ſurvived.</p>
            <p>On the 18th of Auguſt, ſome of the priſoners in the eaſt wing attempted to eſcape. Perhaps they were inſtigated from a conſideration of the unguarded ſtate of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—the abſence of the jailor—and a wiſh to eſcape from the fever. They took the advantage of a viſit from the phyſician. They ſeized upon the key of their apartment—forced their way out, knocked down Mr. Evans, a conſtable, then one of the aſſiſtant-keepers, and called to the convicts in the yard to come to their aſſiſtance. Mr. Wharton, who was in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent part of the jail, on hearing the alarm, went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the aſſiſtance of the keepers. Miller, the ring-leader, had an axe lifted to <hi>diſpatch</hi> Mr. Evans, which Mr. R. Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and Mr. G. Gaſs, an aſſiſtant-keeper, obſerving, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by well directed balls from their muſkets, which broke the bone of his right arm, and entered his body.—Mr. Wharton and Mr. Gaſs fired at the ſame time: the ball from the latter, it was generally ſuppoſed, proved fatal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:035335_0094_100231E0C055E448"/>
Another of the aſſailants, of the name of Vaughan, ſtruck Mr. Evans with a bar of iron. He then retreated to his apartment. Evans purſued him, and lodged a ball in his lungs. He ſurvived it about twenty-four hours. A Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro convict wounded another by a bayonet. They even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually drove the gang into their apartments. During the diſturbance, the convicts behaved well: They did not even ſhow a wiſh to aid the offenders. The bravery and prompt exertions of Mr. Wharton, deſerve a high encomium.—Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Evans and Mr. Gaſs, the deſigns of theſe incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible villains were happily fruſtrated, and the city, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, only thus preſerved from devaſtation and pillage.</p>
            <p>An unſucceſsful attempt was afterwards made by two of the criminals, who were confined in the eaſt dungeon.—They had nearly effected their eſcape, by undermining the wall, when firſt diſcovered.</p>
            <p>On the night of the 18th of October, ſeven of the priſoners were ſucceſsful in making their eſcape. They undermined the wall of the eaſt wing, and got off; and only two of the banditti were taken.</p>
            <p>Several ſea-port towns in the United States, beſides Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, have been inflicted with the ſame calamity this ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It viſited New-York about the 28th or 30th of July, nearly at the ſame period as it did here. The firſt public intimation of its introduction there, was made on the 6th of Auguſt. The citizens did not generally leave the town till the end of Auguſt, and towards the beginning of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Then the diſeaſe had made conſiderable progreſs. The deaths amounted from twenty-three to twenty-five a-day.—It is eſtimated, that one third to one-half of the whole inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants left that city. It continued to rage till the 8th or 10th of November. During this period, the deaths amounted to two thouſand and eighty-ſix. One thouſand five hundred and twenty-four, of theſe, fell victims to its rage. The enquiries made, to aſcertain its cauſe, have generally been directed to thoſe objects which tend to prove its domeſtic origin. Hence, perhaps, it is, that this idea is the moſt prevalent there.</p>
            <p>Its introduction in Boſton happened about the firſt of July. On the 4th of Auguſt, the ſelectmen had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with the phyſicians: From whoſe reports, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that only ſixteen perſons had died with that diſeaſe ſince its firſt appearance; and that there were but ten perſons then ſick: That in all the caſes, the probability was, that

               </gap>, or attendant on the ſick, having, at that time, taken the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der."</p>
            <p>At the ſame conſultation, the phyſicians gave their opinion, that lobſters and oyſters, at that ſeaſon of the year, and until the middle of September, were extremely pernicious to the health, and prediſpoſed the body to putrid diſorders.</p>
            <p>From this time, a regular report of the number of deaths and of the ſick was publiſhed, by order of the ſelectmen, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Wm. Cooper, town-clerk. On the 20th of Auguſt, there were twenty ſick; on the 31ſt, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Afterwards, it gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abated until tho 6th of October, when it was checked at the approach of froſt, and a ſucceſſion of cold weather.—On the 18th, the inhabitants were invited to return from exile.</p>
            <p>It made its appearance at Portſmouth. (N. H.) about the 20th of July, and raged until the beginning of October. Previous to the 20th of Auguſt, eleven perſons died, ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen were ſick on the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A committee of health was inſtituted; they made their firſt report on the 30th of Auguſt. Whether its inhabitants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally aſcribe this ſcourge to importation, or to domeſtic origin, cannot be determined by us, nor, perhaps, by them.</p>

Fifty died at Cheſtor, and at Marcus-Hook, fifty-two—at Chew's Landing, a ſmall vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in New-Jerſey, ten miles from Philadelphia, twenty-ſix died—and at Cooper's Ferry, oppoſite to the city, about the ſame number. There were alſo many caſes at Trenton, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Some went from the city with the diſeaſe on them; others were out but one day previous to being attacked; but, generally, at about three, and ſometimes ſix days after. In ſome inſtances, it was not taken till they had been out ten, twelve, fourteen, and even twenty-one days.

            <p>"Baltimore has happily eſcaped this year. Their ſufferings, in 1797, convinced them of the propriety of an efficient qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine law, and a ſtrict attention to cleanlineſs. Their care and their ſucceſs is a good example to other cities. Their mayor enforced a ſtrict compliance with the ordinance for clearing the gutters, and removing every kind of filth, not only from the ſtreets, but from the houſes and lots. He alſo ſolicited the different fire-companies, to have their engines fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exerciſed in watering the ſtreets. This was complied with, as it was deemed neceſſary to guard againſt its domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic generation. On the 10th of Auguſt, the Board of Health ordered that all veſſels, arriving from any of the Weſt-India iſlands, laden with certain cargoes, which they particularly ſpecified, ſhould be prohibited by the health-officer from coming up into port; but, that the cargo thereof ſhould be diſcharged into another veſſel, while it remained in the river, and that neceſſary care ſhould be obſerved to purify the ſame, before it ſhould be admitted into the city.

His caſe did not come ſtrictly within their cognizance, and he was refuſed. He then ſolicited an entrance into the alms-houſe; but having the dyſentery, and not being entitled to a place of reſidence there, he was unſucceſsful. His next application was to the Health-Officer of the port; but he conceiving himſelf unauthorized to ſend him to the City-Hoſpital, the poor wretch was turned away, without any hope of relief. What became of him, is not known; but

the deſpondency depicted in his countenance, produced a correſpondent ſentiment of ſympathy in the minds of many, all of whom ſeemed to regret his unhappy condition, though none knew in what manner to grant him the aid he required."</p>

            <p>October 16—A dead woman was found in a houſe at the corner of Eighth and Shippen-ſtreets.</p>
            <p>About the 16th of Auguſt, a perſon, paſſing through Union, between Second and Third-ſtreets, perceived a nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious effluvia, of the nature of that which is emitted by cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, in a ſtate of putrefaction.

            <p>The caſe of Jane Doron, at the City-Hoſpital, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remarkable: She was, to all appearance, dead. A coffin was brought, and other preparations for her interment purſued. But ſome doubt remained in the mind of Dr. May, the phyſician. He returned—and, upon examining her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he felt a warmth, near the heart, yet without any palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Urged by this, he then reſolved to try his utmoſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. He began to rub her arm, in order to bring on a pulſe by friction. The ſteward, who was alſo preſent, laid hold of the other arm, and followed the example. In two hours, ſhe ſhewed ſymptoms of life, firſt, by a quivering at the region of the heart, and a few hours afterwards, by an hyſteric fit, which went off with a copious effuſion of tears. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>

Mr. J. Conchy's ſon died of the calamity. The ſame day his daughter went to the river to bring water: She fell in, and was drowned.</p>
            <p>A perſon entered the houſe of Mr. M'P—. He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that he had juſt put a body in a coffin. This alarmed Mrs. M'P—. She immediately took ſick. Diſtreſs, unuſually accumulated, ſoon followed. Mrs. M'P—and a child were attacked. Mrs. M'P—'s mother and brother went to aſſiſt them. They were likewiſe ſeized; and all died but Mr. and Mrs. M'P—: nor did diſtreſs end here:—Whilſt they were in ſtate of convaleſcence, they were recommended to move to a more airy, and leſs-infected ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. On their removal, they hired a white nurſe; having previouſly experienced the negligence of ſeveral black ones. But, ſhe proved to be more abandoned. She let in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons during the night. Their noiſe alarmed Mr. M'P—, who was but juſt able to walk. He went to inquire what was going on; but, he found them gone, and fire on the floor in ſeveral places. They were robbed of caſh, plate, &amp;c.—Even the body-clothes of the two patients, who were in bed, were carried off.</p>
            <p>In many families the mortality was general. Three bodies have been taken out of <hi>one</hi> houſe at <hi>one</hi> time. Whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were, in ſeveral inſtances, ſwept off. Mr. Wiles's wife died on the 26th of September. By the time the hearſe came for the corpſe, his ſon was dead; his journeyman died the ſame day; next day Mr. Wiles died, and his brother-in-law next day after.</p>
            <p>Mr. Scott, a ſtout, robuſt man, in delirium, ran into the ſtreet in his ſhirt and night-cap; and walked up ſeveral ſquares, before he was overtaken. A patient made his eſcape from the Hoſpital with nothing on but his ſhirt, and went to his lodgings, in Water-ſtreet, (a diſtance of two miles); when he arrived, he was covered with blood; It was cauſed by his removing the bandages from the orifice, where he was bled at the Hoſpital.</p>
            <p>The ſcreams of a woman, who died at No. 32, Carter's-alley, were heard to the diſtance of Strawberry-alley, on the one ſide, and Dock-ſtreet on the other. The wall of the room was ſprinkled with blood, that iſſued from her mouth, upwards of two feet from where her head lay.</p>
            <p>

Some were attacked in the ſtreet, others on the commons, and there generally laid till a coach came to carry them to the Hoſpital.—Drunkards, lying in the ſtreet, have alſo been ſent to the Hoſpital, ſuppoſed to have the fever.</p>
            <p>Many ſcenes occurred to the drivers of the ſick coachees, which were calculated to ſoften hearts the moſt hardened! Fathers and mothers delivered to them their ſick children, children their parents, wives their huſbands, huſbands their wives, &amp;c. &amp;c. but moſt frequently, maſters their ſervants and landlords their lodgers.</p>
            <p>A gentleman who remained in the city during the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, principally from an intention of aſſiſting his ſuffering fellow-creatures, in taking his rounds one morning, met with a man lying in a gutter; who, in his agony, had much bruiſed himſelf and torn his cloaths. A number of people at a diſtance were viewing him; but none ventured to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. His own ſon had deſerted him! Shocking to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity! Had it not been for the interference of the above gentleman, he muſt have died, to the reproach of human nature, like a beaſt! He was removed to the Hoſpital, where the laſt moments of this afflicted man were ſomewhat aſſuag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the lenient hand of attention. He lived but a few hours after he was removed from the gutter.</p>
            <p>A gentleman of New-Jerſey, went to Germantown. When arrived, he felt overcome by heat and fatigue; but, notwithſtanding, he tranſacted his buſineſs; and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet off to return home. On his way in the road, which leads from Frankford to Germantown, perceiving a pleaſant place under the ſhade of a tree, he laid down, with an intention of reſting himſelf. Several perſons, who paſſed by, expreſſed their pity for his ſituation, ſuppoſing him ill with the fever, but took good care to keep on the other ſide of the road. At length, a lady, with her daughter, who happened to be rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, perceived him, and ſuppoſing him ill of the fever, ordered her ſervant to drive up to the fence. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſurprized, raiſed himſelf up, and the lady in a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing tone of voice, deſired to know if he was unwell. He informed her he was not. But ſhe ſuppoſing he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to confeſs it, preſſed him, that if he had the fever, and no friends near, ſhe would take him to her houſe, which was cloſe by, and nurſe him herſelf. The gentleman, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035335_0103_10023274A37CD6C0"/>
with gratitude, aroſe, thanked her, and declared that he was only fatigued, and had not been in Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>A perſon from Philadelphia, travelling in weſt New-Jerſey, ſtopped at the houſe of Mr. Craig, a miller, where he was attacked with the fever: he died in a few days. During his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he was nurſed by Mrs. Craig both day and night, who would not let any others go nigh him. She remained with him till he died, and even aſſiſted to lay him in a coffin.</p>
            <p>A woman of Wilmington, after loſing one of her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the fever that raged there, fled with her five children to the houſe of her father, a few miles from Cheſter.—He poſſeſſes a large houſe, farm, &amp;c. On their approach, her father's houſe-keeper came to the gate, and forbid them to enter, at the ſame time faſtened it. The fugitives took ſhelter in a ſchool-houſe, nearly oppoſite, and received daily ſupport, for near three weeks, from the neighbours generally, the father's family excepted.</p>
            <p>During the height of the calamity, it was difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure nurſes. The hire was from one to five dollars per day! Richard Allen and William Gray, two men of colour, were very ſerviceable in aſſiſting to procure nurſes. They recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended none but thoſe whom they ſuppoſed could be truſted.</p>
            <p>A young man, of the name of Henry Bullyberger, of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, moved to Upper-Providence, Delaware county, about fifteen miles from Philadelphia. Contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of his friends, he ſecretly viſited Philadelphia to ſee his relations. He went to the Hoſpital burying-ground: he there ſaw ſeventeen interred. His ſiſter and her huſband, whom he viſited, took the fever, with himſelf, who all died in the ſpace of nine days.</p>
            <p>Many facts appear, which evidence that the yellow fever is contagious in country places, diſtant from tide-water, marſhes, &amp;c. In Germantown, the infection was, in ſeveral caſes, communicated from one to another.</p>

               <head>LETTER From a gentleman of experience and reſpectability, TO THE EDITORS.</head>
               <p>I APPROVE your deſign of publiſhing a hiſtory of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever which has ravaged our city, and divers other parts of America. I hope it will be uſeful to the citizens of the United States, and profitable to yourſelves. Such light as may be in my power to throw upon this ſubject, you ſhall have. I propoſe, therefore, to anſwer your queries accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt of my judgment, in the order you have ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them.</p>
               <p>Query I. "Is it" (the diſeaſe) "of domeſtic origin, or imported? If one, or the other, be pleaſed to ſtate the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for your opinion."</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I believe the diſeaſe, this year, as in the years '93 and '97, to have been imported; and, I will add, contagious: (this being ſtill doubted by ſome, and denied by others). My reaſons are as follow. In the years '93 and '97, the diſorder broke out near the river, and ſpread, with remarkable regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, up and down the river; going from houſe to houſe and from ſtreet to ſtreet, until it extended, from the river, quite to the weſtward part of the city. In the preſent year, it appeared in ſeveral parts of the city, diſtant from each other, nearly at the ſame time: From this circumſtance, thoſe gentlemen who had entertained a belief that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe we had in '93 and '97 was of domeſtic origin, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confirmed in their opinion; and concluded that others,
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:035335_0109_100232C2179DCAA8"/>
muſt now agree with them, that the diſeaſe, both then and now, originated in this city. If the regular manner in which the diſorder ſpread over the city, in the years '93 and '97, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed an argument in favour of its being imported and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, ſo does the manner in which it appeared among us in the preſent year, furniſh an argument, equally ſtrong, that it was imported and contagious. Its ſpreading over the whole city, in the preſent year, has been as uniform as it was before; although it appeared in different parts of it nearly at the ſame time. Two flat-men, who lodged near the ſign of the Croſs-Keys, were among the firſt who died of this diſorder. Two young men, of the names of Ralſton and Beaty, lodged together near the hay-ſcales, up town; they had worked on board the ſhip Deborah; were both ſeized with the fever, and died. A young man, of the name of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, came from Burlington, went on board the Deborah to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> an acquaintance, was ſoon after ſeized with the fever, and died. Doctor Kheimly attended a young man who died with the fever; the Doctor was informed this man belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Deborah. A young man, who belonged to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the gentleman who owned the Deborah, died of the fever. It has been repeatedly aſſerted, that Ely Shoemaker, and 'ſquire Servoſs, were on board the Deborah; they died of the fever. A gentleman, who lives at Kenſington, has aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me, that they were in health until the Deborah was taken there, to be repaired; that ſeveral of the carpenters, who worked on board her, were ſeized with the fever and died; and, from them, it ſpread through the place. Doctor Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newell happened to be near this veſſel when ſhe was there; he was ſoon after ſeized with the fever; it ſpread through his family, and ſome of them died. It is aſſerted, that a man, of the name of Philips, who lived in Water-ſtreet, between Walnut-ſtreet and the Draw-bridge, went down the river and brought up one, or more ſick men, from the Deborah; they died: Philips was ſeized with the diſeaſe, and died.—About the ſame time, the diſorder appeared in the family of the next neighbour of Philips, and ſoon after, in divers other places in the ſouth part of the city, all of which could have been traced to the neighbourhood where Philips had died. It now made its appearance up town, about the hay-ſcales, where Ralſton and Beaty, who had worked on board the Deborah, died; and at the Croſs-Keys, where two ſhallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had died. In conſequence of my profeſſion, as an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, and perſons coming from various parts of the town
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:035335_0110_100232C923C6D810"/>
for medicine, I had an opportunity of diſcovering that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the diſeaſe raged violently in many parts of the city at the ſame time, yet there were many other parts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely free from complaint; but, by degrees, the healthy parts diminiſhed in magnitude, and the ſickly parts increaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they met; after which, again, and before the diſeaſe had ſearched out every part of the town, ſome parts, where the diſorder had raged violently, became free from diſeaſe; whilſt other parts of the town were viſited that before had been healthy. Near thirty perſons have died in a few hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, oppoſite this city, in the Jerſeys. The caſe of the veſſel, mentioned in the newſpapers, ſailing from this city to City-Point, in Virginia, is a ſtriking proof of the contagion of this diſeaſe; from this veſſel the diſorder ſpread, and great numbers of the inhabitants died. About 12 perſons, who came to the annual meeting of the Friends, died. A man came from Wilmington to this city; was in Water-ſtreet, near Philips's; was taken ill ſoon after he returned home, and died. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after, a quantity of rags, for a paper-maker, was ſent from this city to Wilmington; ſeveral young perſons, who handled them, were taken ill and died: from them, ſome ſay, it ſpread.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who hold that the diſorder is of domeſtic origin, have ſaid that many places have been viſited with as great mortality, in proportion to their numbers, as this city; and who have had no intercourſe with any place, ſo as to have taken the diſorder by infection; that the firſt who died among them, had never been from home. This has been aſſerted by ſome, and contradicted by others. It would be an arduous taſk to aſcertain the facts, neither is it material. If this ſhould even be granted, it does by no means prove what is endeavoured to be inferred from it. If handling a few rags communicated the diſeaſe, as at Wilmington, and opening a cheſt of clothes, as was the caſe at Bordentown, might not the diſorder have been carried, in ſome ſuch way, where it has been ſuppoſed to have originated, and at the ſame time unnoticed? Has it not been frequently carried in bales of goods and clothing, from one country to another? Is it then to be wondered at, that it ſhould appear in ſome places where its communication could not be traced or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for?</p>
               <p>In the year '94, this city, Boſton and New-London, were clear of the diſeaſe; and New-York and Baltimore, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with it: In the preſent year, this city, New-York,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:035335_0111_100232CAB1578BC8"/>
Boſton, New-London, and other places, have had it, and Baltimore was healthy. Now, it is ſcarcely poſſible that an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical diſeaſe, originating in ſome peculiar ſtate of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, could appear ſo ſingular. What extraordinary phaenomenon has appeared, in the elements, to produce ſuch aſtoniſhing effects? Had ſome deadly exhalation ariſen from the bowels of the earth—or ſuch a blaſt of air, as, at times, appears in ſome parts of the world, where men are ſuddenly ſmitten with diſeaſe—had the heavens aſſumed an appearance very unuſual, we might, then, have had ſome reaſon to conclude this diſorder of domeſtic origin; but when the weather has been remarkably ſerene and pleaſant—when the inhabitants of Philadelphia and Baltimore all breathe the ſame common air (unleſs, indeed, at Baltimore it is leſs ſalubrious)—that, at the ſame time, a moſt mortal epidemic, as it is called, ſhould viſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, and they all enjoy good health! This cannot be: The diſeaſe we have had among us, I believe, has ariſen from no ſuch cauſe. It is the opinion of ſome gentlemen of the faculty, that coffee and grain, in a ſtate of putrefaction, will generate a putrid fever; but they do not agree in ſaying, how far ſuch a fever is contagious: Some, who admit that they would generate a putrid fever, deny ſuch a fever would be contagious; others do not admit that a putrid fever would ariſe from ſuch a cauſe. If coffee or grain, in a ſtate of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, will, at any time, generate a contagious putrid fever, it will at all times do ſo, the ſtate of the atmoſphere being the ſame, becauſe the operations of nature are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly alike; but, among the farmers and millers in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, no inſtances of the kind has appeared.</p>
               <p>The late doctor Chauvett, who had reſided many years in the Weſt-Indies, always gave it as his opinion, that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, commonly called the Weſt-India fever, from its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing there, was not natural to the climate, but was impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Africa. Doctor Letſom, of London, in a letter to a gentleman of the faculty in this city, informs him, that a veſſel ſailed from Africa in the year '93, and arrived in the Weſt-Indies, having a malignant fever on board; that this fever ſpread among the king's troops with great mortality; that one remarkable circumſtance attending the diſeaſe was, that thoſe who died ſeldom ſurvived the fifth day. It is now further well known, that, from the year '93 to the preſent time, the fever in the Weſt-Indies has been worſe than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. A maſter of a veſſel, who has ſailed to the Weſt-Indies for ſome years paſt, aſſured me, that, in the year '96, he lay
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:035335_0112_100232CF96C5B258"/>
near a Britiſh man of war of 74 guns, that the fever appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among the crew, and that 30 perſons were buried from her in twenty-four hours. A medical gentleman, with whom I am acquainted, has further informed me, that he was on the coaſt of Africa, in the year 1788, when the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that were there, had on board a diſeaſe reſembling the one we have had, in all reſpects. We ſee, then, in the year '88, this diſorder was in Africa; doctor Letſom has tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it from Africa to Philadelphia, in the year '93; and that it has been in the Weſt-Indies from '93 to the preſent year. Is it not then more than probable, that it has been repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly brought from thence to the United States of America?</p>
               <p>That this diſeaſe is the plague, or a plague, is evident, if we attend to the ſymptoms and circumſtances attending it. In the firſt place, great proſtration of ſtrength attended the ſick from the firſt attack; ſome died in a few hours after they were taken ill; many died within 24 hours after; but generally on the fifth day. Many were raving and diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and would have got away from their nurſes if they could. They frequently bled at the mouth and noſe, and died with the black vomit. There is a great reſemblance, in other reſpects, between the diſeaſe we have had, and thoſe plagues which has viſited other countries.</p>
               <p>Under the article of plague, in the Encyclopedia, we are told of a plague that killed ſcarc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> any women, and very few except luſty men. Another plague, mentioned by Boterus, which aſſaulted none but the younger ſort. Cardon ſpeaks of a plague at Baſil, with which the Switzers were infected, and the Italians, Germans and French, exempted; and a dreadful one at Copenhagen, which, though it raged among the Danes, ſpared the Germans, Dutch and Engliſh, who went with all freedom, and without the leaſt danger, to the houſes of the infected. During the plague which ravaged Syria in 1760, it was obſerved, that people of the ſoundeſt conſtitutions were the moſt liable to it, and that the weak and delicate were either ſpared, or eaſily cured: it was moſt fatal to the Moors; when it attacked them, it was, generally, incurable.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe we had in the years '93 and 97 was more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal among men than women; and was ſtill more ſo among the ſtrong and vigorous than among the weak and delicate; and rarely attacked any under 14 years of age; the Weſt-Indians eſcaped it altogether. In the preſent year, it ſeems to have ſeized all ages and both ſexes, except the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:035335_0113_100232D7756D0080"/>
and they have eſcaped it as heretofore; perſons lately from Europe took it readily, and it was generally mortal.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing reſemblance between the plague, which has deſolated other countries, and the ſickneſs we have had, we may ſafely pronounce it a plague. If, then, this is its proper appellation, it has not generated in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca; no cauſe, adequate to the generating ſuch a diſeaſe, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeared among us. To ſay that the elements have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone ſome extraordinary change, is merely an aſſertion that does not appear to have any foundation. Is there not a great degree of uniformity in the temperature of the air and elements, from Maſſachuſetts-Bay to Virginia? and, yet, how different has been the fate of the inhabitants, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places, between the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and the other. What ſalubrity in the air and elements has Baltimore been bleſſed with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Philadelphia, New-York, Boſton, and other places in the preſent year, and which it was deprived of in the year '94, and Philadelphia enjoyed in preference?</p>
               <p>The foregoing are reaſons to induce me to believe the diſeaſe we have had, was not an epidemical diſeaſe, occaſioned by any peculiar ſtate of the atmoſphere, nor occaſioned by any ſtagnated filth in or near, our city. The diſorder we have had is no leſs than a plague; and, as no ſufficient cauſe has appeared to generate a plague, ſo, of conſequence, it muſt have been imported.</p>
               <p>It is generally agreed that the plague was never bred, or propagated, in Britain; but was always imported there: and if it be ſo, may we not, with as much reaſon, conclude it was never bred or generated in America? I do not ſay this is impoſſible, but only contend it hath never yet happened, although we have had a diſeaſe, in the laſt war, approaching thereto, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the camp fever.</p>
               <p>To what cauſe, then, ſhall we attribute the origin of ſuch a diſeaſe? Not to a few bags of damaged coffee, or vegetable ſubſtances, in a ſtate of putrefaction; this, in my opinion, would not do it. Although perſons approaching ſuch a ſource of polluted air might get a fever, yet I cannot believe ſuch a fever would be contagious. My ſuſpicions are, that this diſeaſe takes its origin from human nature.</p>
               <p>There are frequent plagues among the brute creation, and which are confined to one particular ſpecies. I ſuſpect, then, that thoſe plagues originate in ſome peculiar manner among the particular ſpecies which are afflicted, whether dogs, cats, horſes, or horned cattle. Plagues, therefore,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:035335_0114_100232DA94D10678"/>
among men, originate not by means of damaged grain, cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, or any vegetable ſubſtances, in a ſtate of putrefaction; but by means of human nature in a ſtate of peculiar diſeaſe, death and putrefaction. A number of perſons crouded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in a narrow apartment, although in perfect health, will ſoon generate a diſeaſe; and it will be more malignant the longer they are confined. A large encampment, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions are bad, and the men not kept clean, and impurities not removed, will generate diſeaſe—theſe are the jail and camp fever, and reſemble a plague in ſome degree; but to render them ſo virulent, as to become highly contagious, for they are contagious in ſome degree, it may poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that moſt offenſive and deadly exhalation, which ariſe from the human corps in a ſtate of putrefaction; this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of cauſes, together with a particular ſtate of the atmoſphere, produces, as I ſuppoſe, what is properly, and diſtinguiſhedly, called the plague. This effluvia operates upon perſons of a peculiar habit of body, as a poiſonous lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo as ſpeedily to reduce them to that ſtate of diſeaſe, in which they tranſmit the ſame peſtilential miaſmata, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the ſmall-pox, and ſome other diſeaſes, propagate the ſame diſeaſe. I have either read, or heard, of a plague, ariſing from a grave having been opened, when the corps was in a ſtate of putrefaction; the grave-digger being firſt ſeized, and dying; from him it ſpread. That ſuch a cauſe might produce a malignant fever, there is no doubt; how far it would be contagious, depends upon known facts: that the jail and camp fevers are contagious, in ſome degree, is true; and that human corps, in a ſtate of putrefaction, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a malignant and putrid fever, is alſo true; that they may unite together, and, under a peculiar ſtate of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, conſtitute a malignant, putrid and contagious fever, is almoſt certain; and I very much doubt whether any thing ſhort of either one or other-of thoſe cauſes, or theſe combined, would produce ſuch a fever. We are told, that an immenſe ſwarm of locuſts dying has occaſioned a plague. I do not doubt the ſtory; yet I do not believe that this diſeaſe was conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious or catching from man to man; an immenſe number of locuſts, in a ſtate of putrefaction, might contaminate the air, ſo as to render it almoſt fatal for any perſon to breathe it. Thouſands might die from ſuch a cauſe; yet this is a different thing from contagion; every man being ſeized with ſuch a ſickneſs, derives his diſorder immediately from a great maſs of contaminated air; but a contagious, putrid fever is
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:035335_0115_100232E420DE69D8"/>
where the diſeaſe communicates an effluvia; which, being received by perſons of a peculiar habit of body, produces, in them, the ſame diſeaſe. It is highly probable, as I have before obſerved, that every contagious diſeaſe with which mankind are afflicted, ariſes from ſome peculiar cauſe among the ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Thoſe gentlemen who believe the diſeaſe we have had was neither imported nor contagious, advance the following reaſons, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that very few of thoſe who nurſed in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe took it; and many others eſcaped who were much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the contagion, and that it did not ſpread in the country. It is, indeed, one conſoling circumſtance attending the diſeaſe, that there did not appear that danger in nurſing in it, as might have been apprehended from ſo malignant a diſeaſe; but it does not therefore follow that it is not, or was not, contagious. It is true, there are ſome perſons of that peculiar habit of body which do not take the diſeaſe, let them be ever ſo much expoſed to it; were not this the caſe, the world would ſoon be depopulated.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that ſome of thoſe who nurſed at the hoſpital, in the midſt of great contagion, enjoyed their health; but leaving the hoſpital, and coming into town, they caught the diſorder. From this, it is inferred, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was not contagious in itſelf; but that the danger aroſe from the peculiar ſtate of the atmoſphere in the city. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the facts to be as above ſtated, I account for the nurſes eſcaping the ſickneſs at the hoſpital, and taking it in the city, upon other principles. The hoſpital is a building which ſtands alone, and well aired, and was kept clean; the miaſmata, ariſing from the ſick, was ſpeedily extinguiſhed, or carried away by the free admiſſion of the air: this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the contiguous vegetation, and the ſalubrious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations ariſing therefrom, rendered it much ſafer, than where buildings erected, with brick, are crowded together, and the ſtreets paved. By thoſe means, the air muſt have been much more diſpoſed to ſpread contagion, and to add virulency to the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>I have now anſwered your query with reſpect to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the diſorder, and, have further given you ſome reaſons why I believe it to be contagious, many others might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
               <p>2dly, You requeſt to be informed of "the time when the firſt caſe appeared, and where?"</p>
               <p>On the 2d of July, Mark Miller died, as has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:035335_0116_100232EDD1B01380"/>
with the uſual ſymptoms of the yellow fever. And us this caſe could not be traced to any veſſel from the Weſt-Indies, it has been uſed as an argument in favour of its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic origin: But, it is ſaid, the bed on which he ſlept, at his lodgings in Callowhill-ſtreet, was one on which a young man laid, while he had the yellow fever in the year '97. If this be true, as I believe the diſeaſe to be of the peſtilential kind, it accounts for his having taken the diſorder, and points out the neceſſity of well cleanſing houſes. There were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other perſons who died in the month of June and July, (whoſe names I have forgot) with ſymptoms, as it was ſaid, very much reſembling the yellow fever; and thoſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who hold that the fever originated among us, advance theſe caſes as additional arguments in favour of their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis: But, might they not have died in conſequence of contagion remaining, either in beds or cloathing from the preceding year, or from ſome veſſels from the Weſt Indies? for, the diſeaſe is there, and no doubt has been brought by other veſſels beſides the Deborah and Mary; or might not thoſe perſons have died of a billious fever, ſuch as that which ſometimes prevails in the ſummer ſeaſon, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, yet, in its ſymptoms, is very much like the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever we have had among us? It may be ſaid, that if thoſe perſons had received the diſorder either by a veſſel from the Weſt-Indies, from peſtilential miaſmata, remaining in beds or cloathing, the diſorder would have ſpread from them over the city. This does not follow, neither. There is no doubt but that a certain pre-diſpoſition, in the air, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order for it to ſpread, and a pre-diſpoſition of body alſo to receive it. A warm ſummer produces this effect: it both renders the atmoſphere diſpoſed to ſpread the diſeaſe, and the habits of bodies among the people to receive it, and alſo it may require the ſummer ſeaſon to produce this effect, ſo as for it to ſpread generally, yet ſome individuals may take it earlier. This ſentiment ſeems corroborated from a great number having had the diſorder ſince it has generally aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for, as ſome have taken the diſorder ſince the weather has been ſo favourable as to have very much extinguiſhed it, ſo ſome might have taken it from previous contagion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeaſon was ſuch as to promote a general infection.</p>
               <p>Your third query is, "What were the general appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the diſeaſe? Were they any way different from the year '93." Anſwer. The general appearances of the diſeaſe
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:035335_0117_100232EFA4A2A598"/>
ſo nearly reſembled the appearances in the year '93, as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhewed it to be the ſame diſeaſe, yet more malignant and mortal. In the year '93, ſcarce any took the diſorder under 14 or 15 years of age: it was leſs mortal among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than men. In the preſent year, it has been very mortal among all ages, and both ſexes.</p>
               <p>4th. You query, "What were the ſucceſsful modes of treatment? did they differ from former practice?"</p>
               <p>Anſwer. The moſt ſucceſsful mode of treating this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, appeared to be, either by ſalivating the patient as ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as poſſible, or by promoting a copious ſweat, on the firſt ſymptoms appearing; then to open the body well, and by keeping it open with moderate purges, and frequent clyſtering. Altho' the lancet was not ſo frequently uſed as heretofore, yet, in ſome caſes, it was, in my opinion, very proper. The regimen ſhould be of the cooling kind; ſuch as that generally known and practiſed in malignant fevers. If the patient ſhould be ſeized with a pain in the ſtomach, which is ſometimes the caſe, and it is an unfavourable ſymptom, I have known extraordinary good effects produced by fomenting the part with a decoction of flaxſeed. There is no diſeaſe which depends more upon the nurſe; for, if your phyſician is ever ſo ſkilful, if your nurſe is inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, you may, nevertheleſs, loſe your friend; and, it is on this account, that this diſeaſe has been more mortal than otherwiſe it would have been. I have been informed by a young man, who nurſed in the diſorder, at Wilmington, that the mortality was conſiderably leſs among thoſe who were laid under tents, and upon the ground, with only ſtraw under them, than among thoſe who were attended in the uſual way in dwelling houſes.</p>
               <p>5th. You query, "Was the diſeaſe in any caſes infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, when carried into the country, diſtant from tide-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?"</p>
               <p>Anſwer. This diſeaſe was infectious at Germantown: eight or ten perſons took it in two or three families. This diſorder will be moſt mortal in cities that are large, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, (whether they are on tide-water or not,) on account of houſes depriving each other of a free admiſſion and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the air, the encreaſed heat of cities, and their being deprived of the ſalubrity of vegetation, and the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of many citizens confining them within doors.</p>
               <p>6th. You aſk, "What eſtimate do you make of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:035335_0118_100232F50B625268"/>
who have died in the country? How long were they out? Or whether, with them, it aſſumed ſuch fatal or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent appearances as here?"</p>
               <p>Anſwer. I have taken no pains to aſcertain the numbers who have died in the country; but they are much greater than the numbers were in the year '93; neither have I taken any pains to aſcertain what length of time they were out. With reſpect to thoſe who were ſeized with the diſorder in the country, it appeared to be as fatal as in the city, although it did not ſpread as it did in the city: the reaſon for which, I conceive to be, country houſes are better aired, and the advantages they have of the ſalubrious effects of vegetation.</p>
               <p>7thly. "What are the beſt means of preventing its intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or generation, or to prevent its attack, when gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, beſides that of flight?"</p>
               <p>Anſwer. As this diſorder is unqueſtionably imported from the Weſt-Indies, the beſt means of preventing its introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, to ſtop all trade there for a few months in the year; or to oblige veſſels to perform a more effectual quarantine than has been obſerved heretofore. The beſt way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an attack of the diſeaſe, when introduced among us, beſides that of flight, is, to keep your perſon and your habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſweet and clean, uſe moderate exerciſe in the open air, not to ſtand ſtill in the ſun, and avoid taking cold; to live temperately, yet by no means too abſtemiouſly, nor to take purgatives by way of prevention; and, above all things, to acquire, if poſſible, a magnanimous mind that does not fear death. I know of no better preventatives than the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going; yet, as the diſeaſe is the plague, I believe many would take it, if expoſed to the contagion, let them uſe whatever precaution they may.</p>
               <p>8thly. "What are the beſt means of cleanſing houſes, clothes, &amp;c. of the infected, and of deſtroying contagion?".</p>
               <p>Anſwer. Gunpowder ſlaſhed in an infected room will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the foul air, and replace it with air free from conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but, that every cloſet and crevice may be ſearched, ſhut your room cloſe up, ſtop the fire-place, ſet a pan of coals in the middle of the room, on which throw a quantity of brimſtone, and fill your room with the fumes; or, take a handful of common ſalt, or ſalt-petre, and with it, about half a pound of oil of vitriol, hanging, at the ſame time, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apparel, or any other article which you may apprehend is infected, in the room. Theſe fumes will penetrate every thing thoroughly, and cleanſe them from infection. Linens
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:035335_0119_100232FC1686A9A0"/>
may be cleanſed by ſteeping them in ley, and woolens in ſoap ſuds. White-waſh your walls with lime, and waſh your floors with ley. To bury an infected article in the ground ten days will cleanſe it.</p>
               <p>9thly. "Are there any particular claſſes of perſons more ſubject to it than others."</p>
               <p>Anſwer. It appears that ſome perſons are more liable to take it than others. In this reſpect, it correſponds with ſome other plagues which have appeared at different times. I know of no inſtance of a Weſt-Indian taking the diſorder, although there was many in the city during the whole ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Europeans have taken it very readily, and it has been generally mortal among them. Of the Americans in the year '93, I know of but few who took it under 14 or 15 years of age, and as I have obſerved before, it was more mortal among men than women; and it has been more mortal then and the preſent year, among the robuſt and ſanguinary, than among perſons of a ſpare habit of body. Of hard drinkers, ſcarce one in twenty have recovered.</p>

               <p>I HAVE received your circular letter of the 9th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, containing queries relative to the epidemic, which lately ravaged our city and other places on this continent. The good that may reſult from your undertaking is obvious, if it only contributes to propagate thoſe opinions which will lead us to efficacious meaſures for the preſervation of a great population. Many old countries have protected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt plagues and malignant fevers, and why ſhould we not imitate their improvements to obtain the ſame bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? I have now but little to ſay on the various topics of ſo intereſting a ſubject, yet, I think it is the duty of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual,
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:035335_0120_100232FDA3D1E818"/>
to ſubmit to the public any obſervation that he may deem conducive to relieve us from one of the greateſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. That duty I endeavoured to fulfil laſt year, and I would be obliged to repeat what I have already publiſhed, if I were to anſwer all your queries. I ſhall, however, content myſelf with a few obſervations that have occurred during one year more of experience.</p>
               <p>"<hi>Is the yellow fever of domeſtic origin?</hi>" Men wiſhing for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative demonſtration, might perhaps be ſatisfied with what has been already ſaid in the affirmative of this queſtion, and chiefly by the opinion of the majority of the learned in the United States; but, if a proof of another kind is acceptable—a proof of fact and of experimental demonſtration, ſuch a proof has been offered to me by a ſingular circumſtance; and I beg your readers will weigh it with impartiality, while their candour will require no further evidence than that which is in the power of one witneſs to give.</p>
               <p>A gentleman from a foreign country, who arrived during our late epidemic, informed me, that although he was quite healthy, and had lived many years in one of the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia iſlands, he did experience a diſagreeable impreſſion from our atmoſphere chiefly during the firſt days of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival; and that he had even felt ſome fever, which juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarmed him. In conſequence, he fixed his reſidence at two miles diſtant from town, where he never ſuffered any kind of indiſpoſition; yet, as he frequently came into the city, he then always diſcovered that our atmoſphere was impregnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with corrupted effluvia, which he could aſſimilate to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than to the effluvia from rotten wood. This ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was very ſurpriſing to him; for he admired the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and the cleanlineſs of this town in general. I anſwered, that if I could add to his obſervation a greater evidence than that of a ſingle individual, I could derive from it a convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof, that the origin of our epidemic was a contagion abundantly floating in our atmoſphere, and inceſſantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in it. It was obvious to ſuppoſe that this gentleman was endowed with a particular degree of acuteneſs in his olfactory organs, which power, however, is not very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and which many among us do not perceive, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to live in a vitiated atmoſphere. But how could an imported diſorder produce ſuch an alteration in it? Are not populous towns in Europe productive of much more corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vapours, than thoſe that can ariſe from a few patients ſcattered about? and yet none of them, except in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:035335_0121_10023301C98ABFC0"/>
are productive of peſtilence. Moreover, all the houſes here, few excepted, were ſhut up during the laſt prevalence, and almoſt none could produce the uſual ſhare of corruption which muſt continually ariſe from inhabited places. It reſted with me to collect as much evidence as I could of an important fact, becauſe the aſſertion of the above gentleman extended to all the minutes which he paſſed in town, and at every time of his coming into it from the houſe where he lodged in the country. It was conſequently agreed between us that he would ſubmit to a trial, by which I could render both his unprejudiced veracity, and the acuteneſs of his ſmelling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, unqueſtionable proofs of an exiſting contagion in our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. I then deſired him to come with me, while I viſited my patients. If I ſtopped at any place or houſe where there was no ſick, I would leave to him to diſcriminate whether effluvia or corrupted miaſma could be ſmelled in the neighbourhood or in the entries around. This obſervation was very difficult to make; but I thought it could not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to a man who could diſtinguiſh ſuch alterations in the atmoſphere: it was beſides grounded on the opinion and the fact of noxious vapours ſenſibly ariſing from the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds or bodies of patients in the yellow fever, and poſſibly diffuſing at a great diſtance. The man accepted the taſk, and fulfilled it wonderfully well. At every place where I ſtopped or went in, he was able to tell whether a patient was in it or not: he could alſo diſcover when I had put myſelf too much in contact with the ſick. But I objected that the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous miaſma, which he perceived ſo ſtrongly in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood and in the houſes of the ſick, might be ſuppoſed to be the cauſe of the corrupted vapours, which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the atmoſphere. He could not think ſo, he ſaid, becauſe they were quite different, and he was now ſmelling a new ſort of human or animal putrefaction which he had not yet in any degree ſmelled in the general currents of the air, within the avenues and the ſtreets of the city. For a laſt trial, I took with me a clean white pocket handkerchief, and left it a few minutes in the bed of a patient. I wrapped it up again in a ſheet of paper. At the firſt interview with the gentleman, I ſuddenly unfolded it, and ſhook it in his preſence, and pretty near him, when he ſuddenly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my diffuſing very ſtrong and corrupted vapours, ſuch as he had ſmelled before at my patients' houſes. I finally remained ſatisfied of the extreme acuteneſs of the ſenſes of the obſerver, and of his veracity in aſcertaining that our
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:035335_0122_100233041C7B3AB0"/>
atmoſphere was contaminated with corrupted vapours. That the air is conſtantly renewed and purified of any kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure emanations, even without wind, is a fact that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teaches us, in every populous town, and at any ſeaſon of the year; but, ſuch effects cannot take place, when the local ſources of corruption, as the wharves, &amp;c. are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fermentation. This was doubtleſs the caſe of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia. Then, it is not ſurpriſing, that our atmoſphere ſhould bread fevers, contagion and death!</p>
               <p>To unprejudiced people, it will appear impoſſible that an imported diſorder could contaminate the whole atmoſphere during three months, and when ſo few people remain in it.</p>
               <p>The other point to which I may advert, in anſwer to your letter, is the proportion of thoſe who recovered by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of medical art, and by the method of treatment which has been generally employed by the greateſt number of our phyſicians. In giving ſuch eſtimate, however, I wholly co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it within my own opinion, and thoſe of a few medical friends. Owing to the greater degree of malignancy of the laſt epidemic, it ſhould ſeem that the ſucceſs of our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice has not ſurpaſſed that of the year '97, although the beſt remedies were more generally employed. It is true, that it is the peculiar character of a contagious diſorder to increaſe its deplorable effects in proportion to the degree of alarm that it ſpreads; for, patients altogether given up to the moſt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſpair, and deſtitute of proper aſſiſtance, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſoon become victims of the ſickneſs. Theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, oblige us, gentlemen, to limit our reckoning among or from the patients who were timely and properly aſſiſted; and of thoſe, I think, that ſix recovered out of ſeven. If it was made known that this juſt and true proportion of the ſick reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by more reſpectable authorities than that of an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, inſtead of ſo many dreadful accounts of deaths inceſſantly publiſhed, certainly the people at large would at leaſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a conſoling and relieving hope, and in fact, they would be more careful of themſelves; for, thoſe who cannot conveniently remove from the ſeat of the infection, would be more attentive in procuring medical aſſiſtance, for which they apply too late or not at all, for want of confidence in its remedies, and becauſe they are not at all appriſed of their effectual applications. I ſhall alſo take the liberty to ſuggeſt, that the public authority might eaſily obviate the diſadvantage of the abſence of many of our regular phyſicians, by granting to thoſe who chooſe to remain in the infected places, the
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:035335_0123_1002330A8569CDA0"/>
means of attending as many patients as they could, if they are not uſed to keep the accommodation of a carriage.</p>
               <p>One objection may be made againſt the above proportion of the patients recovered under the help of medical art, if we attend, without explanation, to a comparative ſtatement on that ſubject, publiſhed by the health office, the 21ſt of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. So it ſtood;

                  </gap> above ſtatement, in order to convince the people, that there was a great danger for them to ſtay in town, and that the aſſiſtance prepared for them in the city-hoſpital was far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any they could procure in the city: in all reſpects that intention was laudable; and, in many, the conſequences were true; but it behoves a phyſician to explain, why ſuch a great number as the half of the ſick died in the hoſpital, and why three-fourths have fallen victims in town.</p>
               <p>I never granted to a ſick perſon an order for admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the city-hoſpital, but I lamented that it was too late, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one or two days had been loſt, by the patient indulging himſelf in the opinion, that his caſe was not the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or trying ſome remedies recommended by their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; or fooliſhly delaying to take a reſolution, which igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and prejudice rendered very painful to every one of them. To that delay, one or two days were added before the patient would be admitted into the hoſpital, owing to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect in tranſmitting the order to the officers of the board of health, or to the want of ſome body who could be ſent for the carriage, or to accidental delays of other kinds. Thus, it may be juſtly obſerved, to the honour of the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians employed in the city-hoſpital, that moſt of the patients they received were taken ſick three or four, and many four or five days previous to their admiſſion; yet, at that time, they had cured half of them.</p>
               <p>We were in town witneſſes to almoſt the ſame neglects, delays, and prejudices, among the ſick who called for bur aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Many refuſed to be ſent to the hoſpital, who died deſtitute of nurſes and the moſt neceſſary remedies; while they ſurely were not benefited by our atmoſphere. They
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:035335_0124_1002331187FC01A0"/>
were alſo injured by the heat, narrowneſs and uncleanlineſs of their houſes and clothes. As the yellow fever has often the ſurpriſing effect of ſuſpending any kind of painful ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many felt as if nothing of conſequence ailed them, till the approach of death. If, on the contrary, they were attacked with violent ſymptoms, they were abandoned even by their neareſt relations; but few charitable and judicious nurſes could be found; of the remaining phyſicians, many were ſick and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. In ſhort, I have ſeen about ſixty or ſeventy patients, all of the above deſcription; the greateſt part died; and it ſurely will be granted, that if they had received proper aſſiſtance, the greater part muſt have recovered; and, for the truth and juſtneſs of theſe obſervations, I can, I believe, with confidence, call upon the candor and experience of the other phyſicians. It will then be underſtood, why ſo many patients died in town with the yellow fever, without derogating from the eſtimate I have given of thoſe who recovered under medical aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Every body is now inveſtigating what are the beſt means of preventing the return of that calamity. We muſt congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate ourſelves on the laudable and numerous exertions of our fellow citizens. The introduction of pure waters, will, no doubt, prove one of the moſt beneficial improvements; for, it equally anſwers the purpoſe of cleanſing the ſtreets, as refreſhing the atmoſphere. The poor people alſo will have an eaſier and more convenient means for waſhing their clothes, which they are uſed to keep dirty, during the ſummer, until they can gather ſome rain water; but that is not all: many other cauſes did appear to me very obnoxious to the wholeſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the town. The caſements and logs of our wharves are old, and their ſurface is rotten; at low water, when a ſcorching ſun dries them up, they produce very infecting and dangerous effluvia. The vicinity of the docks has always appeared to be the ſeat of many deaths; becauſe, at the periodical return of the tide, their filthy waters are alſo returned, and the moſt corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and black mud is left again on the bottom. Too many crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded buildings are unfortunately erected upon the wharves. The whole eaſt ſide of Philadelphia is walled by a double, thick and high range of houſes, through which the air has but few ſtreets opened to circulate. The conveniencies of the ſhipping and mercantile buſineſs, have thus deprived the metropolis of the refreſhing and moiſt currents of air, that muſt neceſſarily riſe from one of the largeſt rivers<note n="*" place="bottom">There are about ten thouſand houſes in Philadelphia; the ground alſo contains ten thouſand deep ditches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:035335_0125_10023316376BCA38"/>
ſtreets of the ſuburbs, and many of the city, are left in a ſurpriſing ſtate of degradation, and without pavement, while the numerous carriages and great intercourſe with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, render them ſtill worſe; no declivity is given to their waters; no police law is enacted to compel the inhabitants to clean their foot-ways. There the rains, and the common ſewers of houſes, empty, form ponds, and cover the ſurface with a thick ſtratum of animal and vegetable putrefaction. There is nobody in thoſe parts, and even South ſtreet, who could not, when he pleaſes, manure his little garden with the black mud which ſurrounds them. I never could think, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as many do, that the numerous burying-grounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in the city, were of no bad conſequence. I believe quite the reverſe, and I ſupported it in my account of the yellow fever in '97, by reaſons and arguments which I do not think eaſy to refute. All thoſe burying-grounds are ſituated on the moſt elevated points of the city; and as the higheſt part of the city is forty feet above the river, and as the ditches are dug only ſix feet deep, I calculate that the bed of all our dead, lie between 20 and 30 feet above the loweſt ground. How many ſtreets, conſequently, and how many cellars are lower than the loweſt bottom of a burying-ground? I aſk now, whether the conſtant moiſture and vapour of the ground can be infiltrated from any where but from the high ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding parts, and whether waters waſhing thouſands of dead bodies, renewed every year, do not retain the moſt noxious particles, although theſe waters, under the whole ground of Philadelphia, do circulate through the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous clay.</p>
               <p>Theſe are, gentlemen, the points of obſervation which have conſtantly fixed my opinion, on the origin of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever; from which nothing now can preſerve us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a cool ſummer, and frequent N. W. winds. Other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies or preventatives againſt ſuch a calamity, will, I hope, be found in the liberality and experience of our enlightened fellow-citizens; but it would be uſeleſs to ſtreſs upon any other conjecture or hypotheſis. It was always known, and never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected but here, that the vicinity of effluvia from corrupted
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:035335_0126_1002331955CE2F10"/>
animal or vegetable ſubſtances were peſtilential, and produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fatal diſeaſes; and whenever ſuch ſources of contagion ſurround us, and exiſt with us, it would be injudicious to dwell upon mere ſuppoſitions; for the importion of a fever will always be a ſuppoſed doctrine, ſince it is generally grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that during the heat of ſummer, the ſame cauſes can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it on board of veſſels, at ſea or in our ports, and often car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries off the whole of their crews. It is alſo very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that we ſhould receive, by importation, a diſorder which proves ſo terrible among us, while it is but occaſionally in the countries from where we dread to receive it, and where it is hardly thought contagious, and never threatens, to an alarming degree the population nor the proſperity of the inhabitants.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN order to comply with your requeſt to the Academy of Medicine, communicated by Dr. Samuel Duffield, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Phyſician of the port, reſpecting the means of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the return of the epidemic fever, which has lately afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our city, the Academy have conceived the hiſtory of its origin, neceſſarily connected with their anſwer.</p>
               <p>We believe it was derived from the following ſources:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The exhalations of the alleys, gutters, docks, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſewers of the city; and from ſtagnating water in its neighbourhood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The foul air diſcharged with the ballaſt of the ſhip De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, and the cargo of the brig Mary; the former of which arrived from Hiſpaniola on the 18th July, and the latter on the 29th of the ſame month. We reject the opinion of an imported human contagion in either of the above veſſels. It has not been aſſerted that any perſon died of the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on board the Mary, during her voyage: and if it be ſaid,
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:035335_0127_1002332059279728"/>
that ſeveral perſons died on board the Deborah of that diſeaſe, on her paſſage to this city, we cannot admit that they contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the timbers or contents of the ſhip in ſuch a manner, as to ſpread the diſeaſe to perſons at ſeveral hundred feet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he wharf at which ſhe was moored. The impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of this opinion will appear from two conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt—The diſeaſe is not contagious in the Weſt-Indies; and rarely, if ever ſo, in the United States in hot weather, at which time only it makes its firſt appearance in our country. So general is this opinion, that ſome phyſicians have unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately refuſed to admit the exiſtence of the fever in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement in our city, only becauſe it was not contagious.</p>
               <p>Second—The diſeaſe was in no inſtance propagated by thoſe perſons who were ſuppoſed to have derived it from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man contagion adhering to the timbers o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> contents of the Deborah and Mary, and who died with it in parts of the city remote from the influence of the foul air of thoſe veſſels.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid that the contagion of the yellow fever is not uniform in its effects, it ought at leaſt to be admitted, that it acts with moſt certainty where it exiſts with moſt force; but the reverſe of this took place in the ſuppoſed origin of our late fever from imported contagion. We are the more deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in our opinion of the foul air of the Deborah and Mary being the cauſe of many caſes of our fever, from ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes of fever having been often produced from ſimilar cauſes, inſtances of which were mentioned in our letter to you of laſt year.</p>
               <p>In ſupport of our opinion of the diſeaſe being derived from the exhalations of our city before enumerated, we ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the names of the following perſons, who had the fever before the arrival of the Deborah or Mary, in our port, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Benjamin Jones, Fromberger's Court, June 2d; Mary Wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleſworth, near the corner of Walnut and Tenth-ſtreets, June 6th; Rebecca Treſted, in Front between Spruce and Union-ſtreets, June 11th; Elizabeth Curran, Fourth below South-ſtreet, June 27th; Mark Miller, Callowhill-ſtreet, and Molly Zeller, Race-ſtreet, July 2d; Miſs Byrne, Spruce between Second and Third ſtreets, July 11th; Mr. Vannoſt, Shannon-ſtreet wharves, July 12th. We obſerved, moreover, and heard of a conſiderable number of perſons who had the diſeaſe in the weſtern parts of the city, and in Southwark and the Northern Liberties, who had not been expoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, nor breathed the air in the neighbourhood of Water-ſtreet
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:035335_0128_10023323C99C7AD0"/>
for many weeks, and in ſome inſtances for ſeveral months, before they were attacked by that fever.</p>
               <p>In addition to the arguments in favour of the domeſtic ſources of the fever, that had been mentioned in our former letter, we ſhall add four more, that we think cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The atmoſphere of our city, during the prevalence of the fever, produced ſenſations of pain or ſickneſs in many people who came into it from the country; the ſame atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere became the cauſe of the diſeaſe and death in others who viſited the city, and who carefully avoided lodging, or any intercourſe with perſons infected by the fever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The diſeaſe prevailed in many inland towns of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, which had no intercourſe with thoſe ſea-port towns in which it was epidemic. Thoſe towns were, in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we have heard of, ſituated near to putrid ſubſtances, or ſtagnating water.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The diſeaſe was rarely contagious, even when it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in death, when carried into the country, or into towns not expoſed to putrid exhalations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The general extinction of the diſeaſe by froſt, clearly proves that it exiſts chiefly in the atmoſphere; and that it is not derived, in the firſt inſtance, from human contagion; for froſt, it is well known, does not act in the autumnal months upon the bodies of the ſick, nor upon their beds, clothing, or any other ſuppoſed receptacle of contagion.</p>
               <p>We wiſh to direct the attention of our fellow-citizens to the hiſtory of the cauſes and remedies of peſtilential diſeaſes in foreign countries: In the ages of medical ſuperſtition, when thoſe diſeaſes were believed to be imported, they nearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated cities for many ſucceſſive years. Frequent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated ſuffering at laſt begat wiſdom. The cauſes of peſtilence were diſcovered to exiſt in all countries, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic remedies were applied to remove them. The effect of this change in the opinion and conduct of the nations of Europe has been the almoſt general extirpation of malignant fevers from their cities and ſea ports. We have many docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove that the recurrence of the yellow fever has been prevented in the cities of Europe by cleanlineſs. It for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly prevailed in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Holland, and, occaſionally, in Britain and Ireland, under the names of putrid, malignant, and bilious fevers, alſo of the <hi>gall ſickneſs</hi> and of the <hi>black fever.</hi> The laſt name was derived from the
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:035335_0129_1002332B8C6E0D78"/>
black vomiting, which is ſo often the ſymptom of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death in bilious fevers.</p>
               <p>We are the more confirmed in the opinion we have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the yellow fever is a native diſeaſe of our country, by diſcovering that the ſame opinion is held by moſt of the phyſicians and citizens of our ſiſter ſtates. We lament the prevalence of an opinion, that the admiſſion of truth upon this ſubject, will injure the credit of our city. Truth, upon all ſubjects is ultimately friendly to general intereſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, while the remedies of the evils of error, are always of a partial and tranſitory nature. We conceive that the report of the exiſtence of a diſeaſe of a nature ſo ſubtle as to elude the utmoſt force of the health laws, and the greateſt vigilance of health-officers, will be much more injurious to our city, than a belief of its being derived from cauſes which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to our ſenſes, and which, by active exertions, might be eaſily and certainly removed, without oppreſſing or injuring our commerce.</p>
               <p>We ſhall repeat, in this place, the means recommended by us in our former letter, with the addition of ſome others, for preventing a return of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. "Removing all thoſe matters from our ſtreets, gutters, cellars, gardens, yards, ſtores, vaults, ponds, &amp;c. which, by putrefaction in warm weather, afford the moſt frequent cauſe of the diſeaſe in this country. For this purpoſe, we recommend the appointment of a certain number of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, whoſe buſineſs it ſhall be, to inſpect all ſuch places in the city, the Northern Liberties and Southwark, as contain any matters, capable by putrefaction, of producing the diſeaſe, and to have them removed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. "We earneſtly recommend the frequent waſhing of all impure parts of the city in warm and dry weather, by means of the pumps, until the water of the river Schuylkill can be made to waſh all the ſtreets of the city; a meaſure which we conceive promiſes to our citizens, the moſt durable exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from bilious fevers of all kinds, of domeſtic origin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. "To guard againſt the frequent ſource of yellow fever from the noxious air in the holds of veſſels, we recommend the unlading ſuch veſſels, as contain cargoes liable to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and the diſcharging the ballaſt of all veſſels at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the city, during the months of June, July, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, September and October. To prevent the generation of noxious air in the holds of veſſels, we conceive every veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſhould be obliged, by law, to carry and uſe a ventilator, and
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:035335_0130_10023332499DDA60"/>
we recommend in a particular manner, the one lately invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Benjamin Wynkoop. We believe this invention to be one of the moſt important and uſeful that has been made in modern times, and that it is calculated to prevent not only the decay of ſhips and cargoes, but a very frequent ſource of peſtilential diſeaſes of all kinds in commercial ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties."</p>
               <p n="4">4. The filling up, or cleaning the docks in ſuch a manner, that no matters, capable of putrefaction, ſhall be expoſed to the rays of the ſun at low water.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The cloſing the common ſewers, ſo as to admit water only, and the daily removal of the filth of the city, deſtined to flow into them, by means of covered carts or waggons made for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The prevention of the filth of the city from being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated, and ſtagnating in its neighbourhood.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The prohibition of alleys and narrow ſtreets in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture improvement of the city.</p>
               <p n="8">8. An alteration of the preſent health law, which, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining veſſels with periſhable cargoes for ten days at the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, in hot weather, is calculated to increaſe the foul air in their holds; and we recommend alſo, that no veſſel, owned by a citizen of Philadelphia, be permitted to leave or enter our ports, that is not provided with a ventilator.</p>
               <p>We ſhall conclude our letter by deprecating, in the moſt ſolemn manner, the continuance of a belief in the ſuppoſed importation of our fever, an opinion which has led to the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal negligence of the means of preventing its return; alſo by humbly hoping that a merciful Providence may not correct our ignorance and prejudices, by frequent returns of a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which has in five years ſwept away ten thouſand of our inhabitants, and which in a few years may, if not obviated by the only proper remedies, (under the influence of the preſent inflammatory conſtitution of the atmoſphere) annihilate our city.</p>

               <head>LETTER from the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, by direction of the Governor, relative to the late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Fever, to the Board of Health.</head>

               </opener>
               <p>THE Governor is deſirous of ſubmitting to the legiſlature, a comprehenſive view of the mortality and expenditure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the calamity, which has recently afflicted the city and its ſuburbs. He, therefore, directs me to requeſt, that you will favour him with a report, and the neceſſary docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon the ſubject. The information contemplated may be properly embraced, perhaps, by the following enquiries.</p>
               <p>1ſt. At what time, in what place, and in what manner, was the malignant fever introduced into the city and ſuburbs?</p>
               <p>2d. How long did the fever continue to rage, and what is the number of its victims?</p>
               <p>3d. What was the general police purſued by the Board, the overſeers of the poor, and their agents, to ſubdue, or mitigate the diſeaſe, to aid the ſick, to inter the dead, and to maintain the poor?</p>
               <p>4th. What ſum has been raiſed on this occaſion, by taxes, by voluntary loan, and by gratuitous contributions; what ſum has been expended, and what balance remains on hand?</p>
               <p>5th. What is the number and condition of the citizens who have been relieved, and will any extraordinary aid be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, on the part of the legiſlature, for the ſupport of the poor during the enſuing winter?</p>
               <p>6th. What precautions ought to be taken to prevent the recurrence of ſo dreadful a calamity?</p>
               <p>Permit me to add, that it is the governor's wiſh, that the overſeers of the poor, and, particularly thoſe active citizens, who ſuperintended the buſineſs of the camps, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted in forming your report. As the legiſlature meets on the 4th of December, I hope it will be convenient for you to comply with the governor's requeſt, in the courſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent month.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE ſecretary of the commonwealth, in a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 8th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lt. by your direction, having propounded certain queries relative to the late dreadful calamity, a ſenſe of duty, common intereſt, and a poignant retroſpect of the paſt ſcenes of miſery and wretchedneſs, which came more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under our care, have excited an intenſe ſolicitude and aſſiduity, on our part, to anſwer ſatisfactorily your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, and deviſe means for the prevention of ſo terrible a ſcourge in future.</p>
               <p>We regret that the continuance of the diſeaſe to ſo late a period has delayed the adjuſtment of the accounts of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions under our direction, and will conſequently deprive us of that accuracy which is deſirable. We believe, however, that the report will not ultimately be found materially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct.</p>
               <p>A few preliminary remarks, relative to the precautions which have been taken in order to prevent the importation of diſeaſe, may not be ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>The law, in reſpect to quarantine, has been conſtrued and executed in the ſtricteſt ſenſe. Every power and effort which the board, or the officers under their direction, were capable of exerciſing, has been employed to cut off all communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the veſſels under quarantine.—Every poſſible mode of purification, which a law ſo manifeſtly defective would permit, has been adopted, and the moſt rigid ſcrutiny had, before the veſſels were permitted to proceed to the city.</p>
               <p>At the Marine Hoſpital, the fences were extended into the river, the more completely to encloſe the premiſes, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe therewith precluded.</p>
               <p>For the ſake of perſpicuity we ſhall conform, as near as poſſible, to the order in which you have preſented the ſeveral ſubjects of enquiry; and</p>
               <p>1ſt. The malignant fever, according to our information, firſt made its appearance in Water-ſtreet, between Spruce and Walnut-ſtreets, about the firſt of Auguſt. Several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable phyſicians declare that it appeared in the month of June; and, that many unequivocal caſes occurred early in July.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:035335_0133_1002333D35578480"/>
Unſhackled by prejudice, and diffident of opinion, we have endeavoured to trace the diſeaſe to its origin, but without ſucceſs. Thoſe objects which have been pointed to with the greateſt confidence as the foreign ſource of the diſeaſe, on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, afford no ſuch proof.</p>
               <p>Thus ſituated, it would be indecorous, in an official report to the chief magiſtrate, to ſubſtitute opinion for fact. We deem a queſtion, on which the lives of thouſands and the proſperity or annihilation of our flouriſhing city may depend, of too much importance to reſt upon the <hi>excluſive ſpeculation</hi> of either foreign or domeſtic origin.</p>
               <p>In our anſwer to your 6th query, we ſhall endeavour to deſignate ſuch general meaſures as, when properly digeſted by legiſlative wiſdom, are, in our judgement, beſt calculated to guard againſt the recurrence of ſo fatal a malady from either domeſtic or foreign ſources.</p>
               <p>2d. The diſeaſe continued to rage until about the firſt of November; and, partially, until about the 5th. The whole number of victims, excluſive of thoſe who died in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are three thouſand ſix hundred and forty five.</p>
               <p>3d. The City Hoſpital was opened on the 7th Auguſt—all veſſels were immediately removed by order of the Board from all the wharves included between Mr. Levi Hollingſworth's and Tun Alley.—The Board publicly admoniſhed the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the infected neighbourhood to remove without delay.—A quantity of damaged coffee and cocoa, imported on the 30th July, and ſtored in Roſs's ſtores, was reported on the 3d Auguſt to the Board to be in a putrid ſtate. It was immediately put on board the veſſel in which it was impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſent down to the Marine Hoſpital for purification.</p>
               <p>Two ſkilful phyſicians and two aſſiſtants were appointed to reſide at the City Hoſpital, with a competent number of nurſes and attendants, and every thing neceſſary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and relief of the patients was provided. All the powers of reaſoning, perſuaſion, and authority, which the Board poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, ſhort of abſolute coercion, were aſſiduouſly employed to induce the ſick to remove inſtantly to the Hoſpital; for which purpoſe carriages conſtantly attended, and litters were conſtructed as ſpeedily as poſſibly, to convey them with eaſe and convenience.</p>
               <p>All the regular practiſing phyſicians of the city and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties were authorized to grant orders for admiſſion into the City Hoſpital.—Hearſes and perſons were employed for the ſpeedy removal and interment of the dead, and the Health-Office
<pb n="xxvii" facs="unknown:035335_0134_100233402362DA68"/>
kept open day and night, for the purpoſe of receiving applications and executing the duties of the office with promptitude.</p>
               <p>In order to aſcertain the progreſs of the diſeaſe and form ſome criterion by which to judge of its extenſion or decline, as well as to mark thoſe parts of the city and liberties in which it raged with the greateſt violence, a ſuitable perſon was appointed to obtain from the phyſicians the daily reports of new caſes which occurred in their practice ſeverally, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the names and reſidence of the patients.</p>
               <p>Skilful phyſicians were appointed to attend the poor of the city and liberties, and medicines provided for their uſe at the expence of the inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The buildings at the City Hoſpital being found inſufficient, a houſe contiguous thereto was rented; the ſummer houſes were covered with canvas, a number of ſheds, and a new frame building 60 by 20 feet, two ſtories high, were erected for the better accommodation of the ſick.</p>
               <p>The alarming progreſs of the diſeaſe, and frightful increaſe of mortality; the apparent temerity or apathy of ſome, and the indigence and diſtreſs of others, impelled the Board to reiterate in terms the moſt impreſſive, their admonitions to the inhabitants who were in circumſtances to abandon their homes; and, in conjuction with the Guardians of the poor, to provide a retreat for the indigent.</p>
               <p>Tents were accordingly erected on the eaſt bank of Schuyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill, to which they were invited to reſort, and ample provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was there made for their comfort and ſupport. Theſe meaſures being inadequate to the urgency of the occaſion, temporary buildings for the accommodation of near two thouſand perſons were erected on Maſters' ground, two miles above the city.</p>
               <p>The regulation and ſuperintendance of each encampment was confided to a committee of reſpectable and humane citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who voluntarily undertook the arduous taſk.</p>
               <p>By the joint authority of the Board of Managers and the Board of Guardians of the poor, a committee of reſpectable citizens were appointed for the diſtribution of relief to the poor of the city and liberties, whoſe ſituation rendered it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to remove to the tents.</p>
               <p>The infected houſes and bedding were cleanſed and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by order of the Board, ſo far as was found practicable. This, however, was but partial, owing to the inevitable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and confuſion occaſioned by the calamity.</p>

               <p>Excluſive of the above expenditures and numbers of perſons relieved, the guardians of the poor have incurred a very great and extraordinary expence for the relief of orphans and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſtreſſed by the calamity.</p>
               <p>5th. The poor will, doubtleſs, require extraodinary aid from the legiſlature the enſuing winter, in conſequence of the ſuſpenſion of labour during the prevalence of the diſeaſe, the extraordinary expenſes incurred by ſickneſs, or removal from the city, and, in all probability, a ſhort interval from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the citizens to the cloſing of the navigation for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of induſtry.</p>
               <p>6th. No queſtion can be more intereſting, none more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to ſerious conſideration, than that which ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the precautions to be adopted, in order to prevent the recurrence of a calamity ſo deſtructive. Accordingly, we find our fellow citizens generally engaged in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſcuſſion of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Whatever difference of opinion may exiſt as to its origin, all appear to agree in the general ſyſtem of police neceſſary to guard againſt its introduction in future.</p>
               <p>The idea of reſorting to the legiſlature of the union, for an act to interdict the commerce from the Mediterranean and Weſt-Indies, during the ſummer months, appears to be general, and if attainable, would certainly be moſt deſirable, at leaſt until ſome effectual ſyſtem ſhall be diviſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ready for execution.</p>
               <p>The great diverſity of ſentiment which appears to prevail in the different ſtates, relative to the origin of the diſeaſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the powerful influence of commercial intereſt and rivalſhip, may create inſurmountable obſtacles to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an efficient law from the general government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxxi" facs="unknown:035335_0138_10023352727DF2F8"/>
Under theſe circumſtances, we think it will be prudent to perſevere with energy in an application to the ſtate legiſlature, for effectual quarantine and health laws, with liberal endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the ſupport of the ſeveral inſtitutions. It may here be proper to obſerve that a well digeſted quarantine law of this ſtate will be neceſſary (even in the event of a law of the general government) to provide for the eaſe of veſſels which may enter our port from ſtreſs of weather, or other caſualty during the period of interdiction.</p>
               <p>We take the liberty of ſuggeſting the propriety of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the governments of the ſtates of Delaware and New-Jerſey for their co-operation. The principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt and ſelf-preſervation, and their participation in the late calamity, muſt dictate to them the neceſſity of ſuch a coalition.</p>
               <p>A quarantine law to be effectual ſhould make proviſion for the following objects.</p>
               <p>An inſular ſituation, remote from the city, ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, if practicable, for the place of quarantine; if none ſuch can be obtained, forty or fifty acres on ſome convenient part of the Delaware ſhore ſhould be ſecured by a high and ſtrong encloſure—wharves, ware houſes, and other ſuitable buildings ſhould be erected for the reception and purification of cargoes and accommodation of perſons.</p>
               <p>All veſſels from the Mediterranean and Weſt-Indies, from the firſt of June to the firſt October, ſhould there diſcharge their cargoes, which, together with the veſſels, ſhould be thoroughly purified, and perform a quarantine of at leaſt 20 days. Guards ſhould be conſtantly poſted at all the avenues, and guard boats ſtationed around the fleet.</p>
               <p>The law ſhould provide for the prohibition of intercourſe by land or water with ſuch of our ſiſter ſtates as may not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt efficient quarantine laws; and interdict all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with infected places.</p>
               <p>Having deſignated thoſe general regulations, which we conceive are beſt adapted to guard againſt the importation of diſeaſe, we ſhall take the liberty of adverting to meaſures, which appear to us no leſs neceſſary to the health and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of our city.</p>
               <p>If the domeſtic origin of the diſeaſe is denied, yet it muſt be allowed that local cauſes have a potent effect in its diffuſion, and encreaſing its malignity; of this, fatal experience has furniſhed an irrefragable proof in the exceſſive mortality, and number of the diſeaſed, in particular parts of the city and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxxii" facs="unknown:035335_0139_1002335653468260"/>
We believe that theſe dreadful conſequences would be greatly mitigated, if not wholly averted, by a judicious refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the police of the city and liberties.</p>
               <p>The introduction of wholeſome running water for domeſtic purpoſes, and for waſhing the ſtreets, and common ſewers, is in our judgment, an object of primary importance; the cleanſing of all the docks to a depth below the level of low water mark, a ſtrict attention to the removal of all filth and putrifying ſubſtances, and correcting the noxious effluvia from the privies in the commencement of the hot ſeaſon, would, we conceive, be productive of the happieſt effects.</p>
               <p>The great attention which has been paid to the cleanſing of the beſt improved parts of our city, and the obvious ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of remote and confined ſituations, has long been a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſerious complaint.</p>
               <p>Any work, however great, will be but partial whilſt the ſtagnant pools, and filth of the narrow lanes, alleys and yards, in the extremities of the city, and particularly in the diſtricts of Southwark and the Nothern Liberties, are ſuffered to exiſt.</p>
               <p>We beg leave to call your attention to a ſubject which we conſider as deeply intereſting.</p>
               <p>The eſtabliſhment of a City Hoſpital upon an enlarged plan, permanently provided with every thing neceſſary for the comfort and relief of the ſick, and ſkilful profeſſors, nurſes, &amp;c. proviſionally engaged in the event of a recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the diſeaſe, would excite public confidence, and greatly diminiſh the evils of the calamity. The ſituation of the preſent City Hiſpital, we conſider as highly improper for the purpoſe, from its contiguity to the marſhes of the Schuylkill. The lots and improvements thereon, if ſold, would, probably produce a ſum equivalent to the purchaſe of an elevated ſituation, and the completion of buildings bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adapted to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>We have been led into unavoidable prolixity from the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the ſubject, and a wiſh to contribute the reſult of our experience and obſervations. Should they produce, in any degree, the deſired effect, it will alleviate the recollection of thoſe painful ſcenes which it was our lot to witneſs, and our duty to relieve.</p>
