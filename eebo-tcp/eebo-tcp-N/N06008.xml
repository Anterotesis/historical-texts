            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. As to the <hi>Character</hi> of the Perſons St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to deal with.—They, at leaſt the Ring-leaders of them, were, by Birth <hi>Jews,</hi> by Education <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and now lately converted to <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> but yet zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for ſome of their old <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Notions, fond of making <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to their own Scheme, a Scheme, in the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Opinion, ſubverſive of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHILE of the Sect of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> before their Converſion to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> they expected Juſtification <hi>wholly</hi> by the <hi>Deeds of the Law. (Rom.</hi> x. 3.) But now, ſince their Converſion to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Juſtification by the <hi>Deeds of the Law;</hi> and yet it ſeems, not <hi>wholly;</hi> for they hoped that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would <hi>profit them ſome,</hi> be of <hi>ſome Effect,</hi> and they had <hi>ſome Dependence on Grace,</hi> as is implied in the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Manner of Reaſoning in <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 2, 3, 4.—As to their Notions of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by which they expected Juſtification, it ſeems, they conſidered it, not at all, as a Diſpenſation preparitory to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſuited to ſhew them their Need of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to lead them to Faith in him by Types and Shadows; but only as a Rule of Life, to which, if they conformed, they ſhould be ſaved. And it ſeems they did not doubt, but that ſuch a Conformity to it, as they were capable of, would anſwer the End: Little conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if they depended upon their Circumciſion, and their others Works for Life, they were obliged to keep the whole Law.—Juſt as now a Days there are thoſe, who ignorantly imagine, that if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do as well as they can, they ſhall be ſaved; little thinking, that if they depend upon their own Righteouſneſs for Salvation, they ought to yield a perfect Obedience, as they would not finally be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.</p>
            <p>HAD they viewed the <hi>Law of Moſes</hi> as a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preparatory to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> they might more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily have ſoon the Propriety of its being aboliſhed, and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007618_0005_102B87769C535F90"/>giving Place to the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but while they conſidered it, with all its Rites and Ceremonies, only, as a Rule to which they were to Conform, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Salvation, <hi>Chriſt</hi> only making up for their Deficiencies, it was natural to think it of perpetual Obligation; and that not only to themſelves, but alſo to the <hi>Gentile Converts.</hi> When therefore they obſerved St. <hi>Paul</hi> conſtantly preaching <hi>Juſtification by Faith alone without the Deeds of the Law,</hi> and the <hi>Gentile Converts</hi> received and embraced as good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> without their paying any Regard to the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, they were chagrined, and ſet up themſelves to oppoſe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> affirming <q>that unleſs the <hi>Gentile Converts</hi> were circumciſed and kept the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> they could not be ſaved.</q>

               </gap> early Times, the greateſt Enemies Chriſtianity had, and the moſt bitter Perſecutors, enraged to ſee the Rites of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law neglected; ſo theſe <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Chriſtians, by their Zeal for <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, ingratiated themſelves very much, in the Favour of theſe bitter Enemies of Chriſtianity, which made them the more zealous in their Way, that they might not only avoid Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo have it to glory in, that they had proſelyted ſo many <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be circumciſed. <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 12, 13.—So that they were not only bigoted to their Scheme by their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation while <hi>Jews,</hi> and attached to it, as it ſuited their ſelf-righteous Temper; but alſo proud of it, as it freed them from the chief Odium of Chriſtianity, and ſcreened them from the Malice of its bittereſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.—And they were in ſome Places more than a Match for St. <hi>Paul</hi> with all his extraordinary Gifts. They raiſed ſuch a Duſt at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> could not ſettle the Point; but were obliged to refer it to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And they made ſuch ſad Work in the Churches in <hi>Galatia,</hi> that altho' the Converts there, once, could have even <hi>plucked
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007618_0006_102B87AB26F32D18"/>out their Eyes</hi> and given to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet they were now much diſaffected towards him, and even become his <hi>Enemies.</hi> And theſe <hi>Seducers</hi> were in eminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of even overthrowing Chriſtianity in all that Country; which at laſt obliged St. <hi>Paul</hi> to write this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the ſeveral Churches in <hi>Galatia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Now theſe were the Men the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had to deal with; and the Method he took, which was wiſely adapted to let in Light upon, their Minds and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convince their Judgments, may be fully ſeen, if we carefully read thro' this Epiſtle: But I may now only give you a brief and curſory View of ſome Parts of it, juſt to let you ſee his Manner of Addreſs, and his Way of Reaſoning, and how our Text is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in the Thread of the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Argument.— Which take as follows—</p>
            <p>
               <q>THIS Epiſtle is ſent to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> from <hi>Paul,</hi> an Apoſtle, who received his Miſſion not of Men, neither by Men, but immediately from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And it is approved by all the Brethren with him, and it comes wiſhing you all Bleſſings.—But I am aſtoniſhed and greatly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, after all the Pains I have taken with you to inſtruct you into the true Nature of Chriſtianity, to ſee you ſo ſoon drawn away by theſe Seducers, to quite another Kind of a Goſpel; which indeed is no Goſpel: But is a moſt dangerous Scheme.— Theſe Seducers, how plauſible ſoever they appear, ought not to be regarded. Yea, if an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach any other Goſpel, than that I have preached, let him be ACCURSED.—I ſpeak plainly: For I am no TRIMMER. I do not make it my ultimate End to pleaſe Man; but mean, in the Uprightneſs of my Heart, to be faithful to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>—And I know, I received the Goſpel I preached to you by immediate Revelation from God, after, as it was publickly known, I had been exceedingly zealous in the <hi>Phariſaical Scheme;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met with in a very extraordinary Manner, as I
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007618_0007_102B87788DDFE910"/>was going to <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> Ever ſince which Time, I have conſtantly preached this Goſpel; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, not even by any of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but by immediate Revelation.—And I have conſtantly maintained, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> need not be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, or keep the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that no Man is juſtified by the Deeds of the Law, but only by Faith in Chriſt. &amp;c. <hi>Chapters</hi> i, and ii.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>NOT that I countenance Licentiouſneſs. For at the ſame Time, that I thro' the Law am dead to all Hopes of Juſtification by the Law, I am but hereby prepared to live with a ſingle Eye to the Glory of God: Still having all my Hopes of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance founded on <hi>Chriſt.</hi>—And indeed I could not conſiſtently preach up Juſtification by the Law. For if I did, I ſhould quite overthrow the Goſpel. For if Righteouſneſs and Juſtification come by the Law, and is to be obtained by our own Works, then there was no Need of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But he is dead in vain. <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. 17.21.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>O FOOLISH, infatuated <hi>Galatians,</hi> may I not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal even to your own Experience? Cannot you recollect that an extraordinary Outpouring of the Spirit, in his miraculous Gifts, has attended the Preaching of the <hi>Doctrines of Grace,</hi> and not of the <hi>Phariſaical Scheme,</hi> as in all the Churches, ſo alſo among you? And is not this a ſufficient Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they are from God? And were not even you yourſelves converted to Chriſtianity by theſe Doctrines attended with a divine Influence? And can you think to perfect yourſelves now by going off from this ſpiritual, divine Scheme, to one, ſo mean and low? <hi>Chap.</hi> iii. 1—5.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>AND this indeed, is not any new Doctrine. It is the old Way of Juſtification. Your Father <hi>Abraham</hi> was, two Thouſand Years ago, juſtified in this Way. And in this Way all his Children are juſtified. <hi>Ver.</hi> 6—9.</q>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007618_0008_102B87ACF9A81608"/>
               <q>BESIDES, you cannot be juſtified by the Law, if you are ever ſo deſirous of it. All your Hopes are built upon ignorant and miſtaken Notions. For it is evident that the Law requires ſinleſs Perfection under the ſevereſt Penalty.—Therefore, ſo far from being juſtified will you be, if you adhere to this Way of Juſtification, that every Man of you, who does ſo, will inevitably fall under the Curſe. For it is expreſsly written, <hi>curſed is every one, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in all Things, which are written in the Bock of the Law, to do them. Ver.</hi> 10.—And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſee you remember, that if you are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and intend to be ſaved by the Law, that you yield a ſinleſs Perfection. For I <hi>Paul</hi> aſſure every Man of you, that is circumciſed under that Notion, that he is a Debtor to keep the whole Law, he is bound to yield a perfect Obedience, as he hopes to be ſaved. For if you go this Way to obtain Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, I aſſure you, whatever you think, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will profit you nothing: You ſhall, however you may flatter yourſelves, have no Benefit from him: But muſt ſtand, or fall, as you yield a perfect Obedience, or not. <hi>Chap.</hi> v. 2, 3, 4.

                     <p>An <hi>Arminian</hi> might juſtly query—Why did not the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> reply to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſay—<q>Sir, you quite abuſe us, we have no Notion of being juſtified by Law in your Senſe. We only depend upon our ſincere Obedience, and hope and expect to receive ſome Benefit from Chriſt, and free Grace, as you are ſenſible. We are in the Main, exactly of your Mind.

                           </gap>ou yourſelf know we do not pretend to perfect Obedience. Why then do you bear down ſo very hard upon us? And even pronounce the Man ACCURSED, that teaches our Scheme? Pretending that it is ſo eſſentially different from yours. We think we obey God in being circumciſed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Rites of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law. And you think you obey God in not doing theſe Things. We own we have been too uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable in thinking none could be ſaved, unleſs they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed and kept the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But, if this is all the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror we are in, you are full as uncharitable towards us, to doom us to Deſtruction for ſuch a Miſtake. Therefore, being now willing to give up this one Point, as for all the Reſt, we think your own Words will equally ſuit us both. <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 3, 4. <hi>Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not. And let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth. Who art thou that judgeſt another Man's Servant?</hi> For as to the Terms of Juſtification, that one Miſtake excepted, we are exactly of your Mind.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>AND had St. <hi>Paul</hi> been in the ſame Scheme with our modern <hi>Arminians,</hi> I do not ſee how he could have anſwered them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to own, as he would have been, that their Notions about Juſtification were right in the Main, although he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them by wholeſale.</p>
                     <p>BUT if St. <hi>Paul</hi> denied Juſtification, by any Kind of Obedience, ſhort of abſolute Perfection, how ſincere ſoever it might be, as it is plain he did; then there was no Room for the <hi>Galatians</hi> to make this Reply to his Manner of arguing. Nor is there any more Room for the <hi>Arminian</hi> Way of Juſtification by ſincere Obedience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Way of reaſoning.—For if they will be juſtified by their Obedience, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will profit them nothing, will make up for none of their Defect. They therefore muſt yield a perfect Obedience, or fall under the Curſe; but they do not yield a perfect Obedience. As many, therefore, as are, not only in Head, but in Heart, in the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme, are under the CURSE, according to St. <hi>Paul. Gal.</hi> iii. 26.</p>

               <q>AND if to all this you ſhould object, and ſay— <hi>And what was the Law given for, if we are not to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it?</hi>—I reply, it was given to anſwer many wiſe Ends, as for Inſtance, to check and reſtrain Vice. <hi>Chap.</hi> iii. 19. But eſpecially to be a School-Maſter, to bring us to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that we might be juſtified by Faith. For by the Law all Sin was forbid under the higheſt Penalty.

III. AND now that we may more fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, let us turn back to the ſacred Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and take a View of the Law given on <hi>Mount-Sanai,</hi> that we may ſee what Foundation there was in that Diſpenſation, for this Obſervation of the inſpired <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us begin then with the xixth <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,</hi> and ſee the particular Steps divine Wiſdom took to introduce that Diſpenſation, after that God had already in general prepared the Way for it, by redeeming the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by an out-ſtretched Hand, by Signs and Wonders, and led them through the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi>—Two Months they had now been in the Wilderneſs (miraculouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied were they with Water out of the flinty Rock, and with Bread from Heaven) when they came to the Mount of God—and all to teach them, that the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> was the MOST HIGH GOD; and to make them ſenſible, that they were under the greateſt and ſtrongeſt Obligations to him.</p>
            <p>ISRAEL pitched in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Sinai,</hi> and there they camped before the Mount. And that it might be ſeen whether they would receive his Law, God called unto <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the Mountain, and ſent him to the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and bid him tell the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>—"Ye have ſeen what I did unto the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and how I bare you on Eagle's Wings, and brought you unto my ſelf. Now therefore if ye will obey my Voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye ſhall be a peculiar Treaſure to me above all People: For all the Earth is mine." To which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made Anſwer—"All that the Lord hath ſpoken will we do."—"And <hi>Moſes</hi> told the Words of the People unto the Lord."—And the Lord ſent him to ſanctify the People that Day, and the next, that they might be ready againſt the third Day, when he would come down in the Sight of all the People upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>—"And it came to paſs on the third Day in the Morning, that there were Thunders and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007618_0011_102B877BF0E10020"/>and a thick Cloud upon the Mount, and the Voice of the Trumpet exceeding loud: So that all the People that was in the Camp trembled."—Upon which "<hi>Moſes</hi> brought forth the People out of the Camp to meet with God. And Mount Sinai," to look to,
"was altogether on a Smoke. And the Smoke thereof aſcended as the Smoke of a Furnace: And the whole Mount quaked greatly. And the Voice of the Trumpet ſounded long, and waxed louder and louder." <hi>Exod.</hi> xix. "And the Sight of the Glory of the Lord was like DEVOURING FIRE on the Top of the Mount, in the Eyes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael." Chap.</hi> xxiv. 17.—And all this, to fill the Hearts of the whole Congregation with a Senſe of the Greatneſs and Majeſty of God, and their infinite Obligations to be obedient.</p>
            <p>Now from the Mountain, with all theſe ſolemn and awful Things attending, God gave forth his Law, with a Voice ſo exceeding loud, as to be heard by the whole Congregation, containing perhaps near three Millions of Souls: Which filled the whole Congregation with ſo great Terror, that they beſought that God would not ſpeak any farther to them in this awful Manner, leſt they ſhould die under it. <hi>Chap.</hi> xx. 18.19.</p>
            <p>"AND God ſpake all theſe Words, ſaying,"</p>
            <p>"I AM THE LORD THY GOD, which have brought the out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the Houſe of Bondage."</p>
            <p>"THOU ſhalt have no other Gods before me."</p>
            <p>"THOU ſhalt not make unto thee any graven Image," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>"THOU ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>"REMEMBER the Sabbath Day to keep it Holy," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Even Ten Commandments.</p>
            <p>THE Sum of all which was "thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart.—And thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thyſelf."</p>

AND it was charged upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had paſſed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> that they ſhould ſtand, Part on Mount <hi>Gerizzim,</hi> and Part on Mount <hi>Ebal:</hi> and that the <hi>Levites</hi> ſhould ſay, "CURSED be the Man, that maketh any graven, or molten Image," &amp;c.—"And all the People ſhall ſay, AMEN." And the CURSE was to be repeated <hi>twelve</hi> Times, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Number of the <hi>twelve</hi> Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all the People were to ſay AMEN.—And to ſum up the Whole, the <hi>Levites</hi> were to ſay, "CURSED be the Man that confirmeth not all the Words of this Law, to do them." (Or according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> "that continueth not in all Things, written in the Book of the Law, to do them.") "And all the People ſhall ſay, AMEN."—Thus the Law, as requiring ſinleſs Perfection under the Penalty of the CURSE, was, in this public Manner, and with the utmoſt Solemnity, to be approved by the whole Congregation, as holy, juſt and good. <hi>And all the People ſhall ſay, AMEN.</hi> Deut. xxvii.</p>

            <p n="4">IV. BUT that this Point may ſtand in the cleareſt Light, and the Juſtneſs of the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Obſervation be ſeen in the plaineſt Manner, theſe following Particulars may be diſtinctly noted and illuſtrated.</p>
            <p n="1">1. "THAT the Law given on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſinleſs Perfection of the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>"—If ſinleſs Perfection be defined to be, "a feeling and acting towards intelligent Beings, as being what they are;" this, their Law required. For it required them, "to love God with all their Heart, and obey him in every Thing; and to love their Neighbours as themſelves, and to do as they would be done by:" Which would have been to feel and act towards God and their Neighbours, as being juſt what they were.—Or, if ſinleſs Perfection conſiſts in always doing that, "which is right and fit and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to be done, all Things conſidered:" Still it comes to the ſame Thing. To love God with all our Heart, and obey him in every Thing; and to love our Neighbours as ourſelves, and do as we would be done by; is the Sum of what is to be done by us, "as right and fit and beautiful."—Or, if ſinleſs Perfection conſiſts in a perfect Conformity of Heart
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007618_0014_102B87B21731CA38"/>and Life to the Will and Law of God:" This was plainly required. For it is eſſential to every Law, to require an exact, and entire Conformity to itſelf. And it is a plain Contradiction to ſuppoſe, that God did not require them to do <hi>all</hi> that he did require them to do. They were always to obey God, and never to diſobey him. And the Law reſpected their Hearts and Lives, their Thoughts, Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; all their inward Tempers, and all their outward Behaviour: And it was never lawful for them to commit the leaſt Sin, or to omit the leaſt Duty; but, as to all Things written in the Book of the Law, they were to do them.—And</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS perfect Obedience was the Condition, upon which, the Law promiſed Life."—"Ye ſhall keep my Statues and my Judgments, which if a Man do, <hi>he ſhall live in them. Lev.</hi> xviii. 5. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>four</hi> Times more in the <hi>Old-Teſtament;</hi> once in <hi>Neh.</hi> ix. 29. thrice in <hi>Ezek.</hi> xx. 11, 13, 21. And <hi>twice</hi> in the <hi>New-Teſtament;</hi> once in <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 5. and once in <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 12.</p>
            <p>AND, that this <hi>Life,</hi> thus promiſed in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law upon Condition of perfect Obedience, implied in it ETERNAL LIFE and Happineſs, is evident from the Teſtimony of our Bleſſed Saviour, in <hi>Luke</hi> x. 25—28. "What ſhall I do to inherit ETERNAL LIFE?" Said a certain <hi>Jew</hi> to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> To whom our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, turning him back to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> with theſe Queſtions, "what is written in the Law? How readeſt thou?"—To which the Man anſwered and ſaid,—"Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength, and with all thy Mind; and thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thyſelf."—This he gives, as the Sum of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law.—To which our Saviour replied,—"Thou haſt anſwered right. <hi>This do, and thou ſhalt live."</hi> i. e. Inherit ETERNAL LIFE.—The ſame Reply our Saviour made to another Man, who alſo came to him, to know, <hi>what he ſhould do that he might have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007618_0015_102B878048ED1090"/>ETERNAL LIFE:</hi>—"If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments." Said our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> xix. 16, 17.—It is plain, that in both theſe Paſſages, our Saviour means to declare how <hi>Eternal Life</hi> was to be obtained by the Law: And he gives the ſame Anſwer that <hi>Moſes</hi> had done before. <hi>Which, if a Man do he ſhall live in them.</hi> So that according to our Saviour's Interpretation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ETERNAL LIFE was implied in the <hi>Life</hi> therein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
            <p>THIS alſo is plain from the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> x. Where oppoſing the Way to Juſtification and <hi>eternal</hi> Life by <hi>the Law,</hi> to that which is by <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> and ſhewing the Difference, he ſays, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.

Where he intimates that the Law does not promiſe Juſtification to Faith, but to perfect Obedience; plainly taking it for granted, that <hi>the Life,</hi> promiſed in the <hi>Law,</hi> implied ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL LIFE.—I have inſiſted the longer on this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if the <hi>Life</hi> promiſed in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law implied <hi>eternal Life;</hi> no doubt, the <hi>Death</hi> threatned, implied <hi>eternal Death:</hi> Which ſeems to be the Meaning of <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 23. "The Wages," (i. e. according to Law) "of Sin is Death." i. e. Eternal Death and Miſery: Even as "the Gift of God is <hi>eternal Life</hi> thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt."—Therefore I may venture to affirm</p>
            <p n="3">3. "THAT the CURSE threatned in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, againſt the Man that broke it in any one Point, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in it, ETERNAL DAMNATION, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Abatements made on Account of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability."</p>
            <p>How great their Impotency was, whether from their native Corruption, or from their contracted bad
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007618_0016_102B87B3F12CDE00"/>Habits, I ſhall not pretend now to determine. But, as they were Deſcendants of <hi>Adam,</hi> and had been educated in <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo, I ſuppoſe, they were, at leaſt, as bad as the Generality of Mankind.—But, be it ſo they were ever ſo bad, ever ſo diſinclined to yield this perfect Obedience in Heart and Life, yet the Law is not brought down to their vitiated Taſte, and corrupt Hearts; but they are ſtill required, to love God with all their Hearts, and obey him in every Thing, under the Penalty of the Curſe.—</p>
            <p>Now that the <hi>Law</hi> did <hi>curſe</hi> every One, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued not in all Things written in the Book of the Law to do them, is plain from <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvii.—and that this <hi>Curſe</hi> compriſed the <hi>Sum total</hi> of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to Sin, according to the <hi>Law,</hi> there is no Doubt.—And that ETERNAL DAMNATION was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the Puniſhment threatned in the <hi>Law,</hi> and compriſed in the <hi>Curſe</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvii. I think is evident.—</p>
            <p>FOR otherwiſe the wicked <hi>Jews,</hi> who died in their Sins, were not expoſed to Hell: But we ſee they were expoſed to Hell, from the Repreſentation <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives in his Parable of the <hi>Rich Man</hi> and <hi>Lazarus.</hi> "The rich Man died and was buried, and in HELL he lift up his Eyes being in Torments." <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 22, 23. —This Parable was ſpoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> then under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law.—But they could not have been expoſed to Hell, unleſs it were by <hi>their own Law,</hi> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſsly affirms, that they ſhould be judged by that, and by no other: "As many as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law."

            <p>BESIDES if the <hi>Jews,</hi> who enjoyed the Benefit of divine Revelation, were not expoſed to <hi>Hell</hi> for their Sins; it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the benighted <hi>Gentiles</hi> were.—And if neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Gentile</hi> were in Danger of <hi>Hell,</hi> previous to the coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>ANSWER. God deſigned the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation as a SHADOW of ſpiritual Things.—Their Bondage in <hi>Egypt</hi> was a Shadow of our ſpiritual Bondage—Their Redemption out of <hi>Egypt</hi> a Shadow of our Redemption by <hi>Chriſt</hi>—The Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with all the <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Honey,</hi> a Shadow of Heaven and its eternal Delights and Joys—Their being turned out of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for their Sins, and <hi>Curſed</hi> in all their temporal Intereſts, a Shadow of an eternal Baniſhment from Heaven, and of the everlaſting Miſeries of Hell.—So that the <hi>Curſe</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law was, in its <hi>ſpiritual Meaning,</hi> of the ſame Import, with the <hi>Curſe</hi> that ſhall be executed at the laſt Day; when the Judge ſhall ſay, "Depart from me, ye CURSED, into everlaſting Fire." <hi>Matt.</hi> xxv. 41. And accordingly, St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood it ſo.— This is the true Solution of the Difficulty. And it muſt be quite ſatisfactory to thoſe who believe, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation was by God deſigned to be a <hi>Shadow</hi> of ſpiritual Things. For this being ſuppoſed, and taken for granted, as indeed it is every where in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> might be full as certain what was the <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as what was the <hi>literal</hi> Senſe.—Nor was this <hi>ſpiritual Senſe</hi> deſigned to be wholly hid from the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the learned Dr. <hi>Warburton</hi> ſeems to imagine; (vid. <hi>div. Leg. Moſ.</hi>) but rather, we ought to think, God deſigned to give them ſome general Idea of the <hi>Subſtance</hi> by all thoſe <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> which were held forth before their Eyes, (and in which <hi>the Goſpel was preached to them: Heb.</hi> iv 2.) becauſe otherwiſe theſe Shadows would have been of no Service to lead them to look to the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was to come: And ſo the End for which they were appointed, would have been fruſtrated. They were, therefore, not deſigned to <hi>ſecrete;</hi> but to <hi>reveal</hi> ſpiritual Things: Not indeed <hi>clearly;</hi> but yet to give a <hi>Shadow of them:</hi> And ſuch a <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> as was well ſuited to lead their Minds to the <hi>Subſtance.</hi> As might be largely ſhewn.—Particularly, all the <hi>Curſes</hi> written in their Law againſt the Sinner, were deſigned and ſuited, not to <hi>hide</hi> and <hi>ſecrete</hi> the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> but to <hi>reveal</hi> and <hi>realize</hi> it to the Heart. And while the guilty <hi>Jew</hi> died <hi>ſenſibly</hi> under the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> and <hi>Curſe of the Law,</hi> he could have a Proſpect of nothing but a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Eternity, nor expect any Thing ſhort of <hi>eternal Damnation.</hi> i. e. To continue forever under the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> an <hi>accurſed</hi> Creature.—But whether every Reader ſhall think <hi>this,</hi> the true Solution of the Difficulty mentioned in the <hi>Objection,</hi> or not; yet this is plain, that by the <hi>Curſe,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> means that <hi>eternal Miſery from which Chriſt redeems Sinners:</hi> and by the <hi>Law,</hi> he means <hi>the Law of Moſes,</hi> of which he had been ſpeaking, and out of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>

                  <p>Perhaps, by this Time, ſome Readers may begin to pauſe, and reaſon within Themſelves, and ſay.—<q>How can theſe Things be? I never experienced any ſuch Thing.

Nor do they think it neceſſary: But think as I do, that if Men are <hi>ſincere in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</hi> they will be ſaved at laſt.—And it muſt be ſo: For neither <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor <hi>David,</hi> were perfect.

AND now, there is but one Thing more, that needs to be obſerved, in order to our full Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Apoſtle's Reaſonings upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and to prepare the Way to apply all, that has been ſaid, to us, who are not <hi>Jews,</hi> who were never under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, but are by Nature <hi>Gentiles.</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>THAT the Law given at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as to its moral Precepts, was nothing more than a new and plainer Edition and Republication of the Law of Nature, which had been in Force from the Beginning of the World, and was equally binding to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in all Ages. To love God with all the Heart, and our Neighbour as our Selves, being
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007618_0028_102B87BEF249F278"/>equally the Duty of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as of <hi>Jews;</hi> and the leaſt Sin expoſing <hi>Gentile,</hi> as well as <hi>Jew</hi> to the everlaſting Wrath of God.</p>
            <p>ALL this is implied in <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 18. <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all Ungodlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men</hi>—He means, be they, <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as is plain from what follows.—One as well as the Other, is expoſed to <hi>the Wrath of God,</hi> for <hi>any Ungodlineſs,</hi> or <hi>Unrighteouſneſs;</hi> i. e. for <hi>any</hi> Neglect of Duty to God, or Man; i. e. for <hi>any</hi> Defect of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Holineſs,</hi> in Heart, or Life. And that, which makes it evident this is his true Meaning, is, that in theſe Words he deſignedly lays down a <hi>Maxim,</hi> upon which to build his whole Argument, by which to prove the <hi>whole World to be guilty before God,</hi> and that <hi>no Fleſh,</hi> whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> could be <hi>juſtified in the Sight of God,</hi> by their own Virtue and good Deeds. The Sum of his Argument is this—"every Sin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to the everlaſting Wrath of God: But both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed to the everlaſting Wrath of God." <hi>The whole World ſtand Guilty before God.</hi> "No Man can be juſtified by Law, unleſs he yield a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience: But there is none Righteous, no not One in this Senſe: Therefore no Fleſh can be juſtified in the Sight of God by Law."—This, I ſay, is the Sum of his Argument.—Which plainly ſuppoſes, that the <hi>Gentile</hi> was bound by the Law of Nature to <hi>ſinleſs Perfection,</hi> juſt as the <hi>Jew</hi> was by the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> And was equally expoſed to <hi>the Wrath of God</hi> for <hi>any</hi> Neglect.—For otherwiſe, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, altho' it might prove, that no ONE <hi>Jew</hi> could be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Yet it would not prove, that no ONE <hi>Gentile</hi> could be juſtified by the Law of Nature, which he was under. Which yet the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intended to prove; that the <hi>Gentile,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jew,</hi> might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Need of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Goſpel-Grace.—</p>

BESIDES, if the <hi>Gentile</hi> could be juſtified by the Law of Nature, he might juſtly reject the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> upon the ſame Ground, upon which, the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> unjuſtly rejected it.

            <p>AND if this had been the Caſe, as to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they might have been thus ſaved by the Law of Nature; it will follow, that there never had been any Need of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, had it not have been for the Law given on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Had they remained only under the Law of Nature, they might have been ſaved by it too, as well as the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And ſo the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made neceſſary <hi>merely</hi> by the <hi>Sinai</hi>-Law. And ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being a <hi>School-Maſter</hi> to teach the <hi>Jews</hi> their Need of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it was the <hi>only Thing</hi> that made <hi>Chriſt</hi> needful. To ſuppoſe which, would overthrow <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> too.—All which Abſurdities, plainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on the preſent <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> do ſufficiently prove
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007618_0030_102B87C0A2369738"/>it to be falſe; and demonſtrate that the Law of Nature did require ſinleſs Perfection on Pain of eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> juſt as the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> did of the <hi>Jews.</hi>—And now the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be concluſive, and <hi>no Fleſh,</hi> whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> by their own good Deeds can be juſtified in the Sight of God.—For neither the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> could <hi>give Life.</hi>—And there was a Neceſſity for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to die for the <hi>Gentile,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jew.—All having ſinned—and the whole World ſtanding guilty before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, it may be added, that Sin did, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Reaſon and ſtrict Juſtice, deſerve eternal Damnation, antecedent to the giving of the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> or it did not.—If it did; then, by the Law of Nature, eternal Damnation was Due.—If it did not; then, the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was too ſevere, in threatening a greater Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Sin than in ſtrict Juſtice it deſerved.

And ſo <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> are all under Sin—the whole World ſtand guilty before God—And by their own Virtue or Goodneſs no Fleſh can be juſtified in his Sight—and ſo all ſtand in abſolute, periſhing Need of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and free Grace. —And now upon a Review of all that has been ſaid, the following <hi>Remarks</hi> and <hi>Inferences</hi> may juſtly be made.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>THE Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Manner of Reaſoning upon it, are inconſiſtent with the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme of Religion, and do as effectually confute it, as the Scheme of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of that Age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ONE of the moſt fundamental <hi>Maxims</hi> in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> Scheme, is,—<q>That, in the Nature of Things, it is not juſt for God to require more of his Creatures than they can do, and then threaten to puniſh them for not doing.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>AND ſo they ſuppoſe, that God was bound in Juſtice to make ſome Abatements in his Law, and to bring it down to a Level with our preſent State; and yet are ſo abſurd and inconſiſtent, as to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died to purchaſe theſe Abatements, i. e. died to get Juſtice done us.—And if we will yield ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to this <hi>new, abated</hi> Law, we ſhall be juſtified and ſaved. —This ſincere Obedience, it ſeems, is the utmoſt, that God in Juſtice can require of us. So then, if we yield <hi>this,</hi> we ſhall be juſtified, becauſe we have come up to the Rule of our Duty. Or, if we have any Defects, (i. e. are not ſo ſincere as we ſhould be,) <hi>Chriſt</hi> will make up for them. Theſe are the Notions of Many And <hi>they,</hi> for Subſtance, being the very ſame the <hi>Phariſaical Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latian:</hi> had, St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Arguments lie full againſt them. And was St. <hi>Paul</hi> to deal with them, he would ſay,—<q>I <hi>Paul</hi> ſay unto you, that your Duties will not ſave you, unleſs you yield a perfect Obedience. And while you ſeek to be juſtified by your own Goodneſs, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will be of no Effect to you, will make up for none of your Failings. <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 3, 4, 5.

            </p>
            <p>WELL,—be it ſo—How then will they reconcile their Scheme with the <hi>Law of Moſes?</hi>—Did not the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> require perfect Obedience? It is plain it did. It is a Fact that cannot be denied. <hi>Arminians Pelagians, Socinians,</hi> that are Men of Learning do not pretend to deny it.—Well, had the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> POWER, in the Senſe <hi>Arminians</hi> uſe the Word, to yield perfect Obedience, in Heart and Life, all their Lives long, without ever failing in the leaſt Degree, in any one Point, at any one Time? It is plain they had not. Yea, no <hi>Arminian</hi> ever pretended they had.—Well, when the <hi>Levites</hi> ſaid, <hi>Curſed be the Man, that confirmeth not all the Words of this Law, to do them;</hi> were not all the People to ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> and ſo approve the Law in all its Rigour? This again is plain Fact.—So that here, the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> has no <hi>metaphyſical Niceties,</hi> (as he loves to call thoſe clear Diſtinctions, and concluſive Arguments, which he is not able fairly to get rid of,) to grapple with; but <hi>plain Facts.</hi> Facts acknowledged on all Hands.—Now <hi>Facts are ſtubborn Things.</hi>—Here we ſee, God gave a Law, required more than they could do, denounced the <hi>Curſe</hi> againſt the Man, that failed in the leaſt Point; and yet, in expreſs Contradiction, the <hi>Arminian</hi> ſays, <q>it is abſolutely unjuſt for God to require more of his Creatures than they can do, and then threaten to puniſh them for not doing.</q> Wherefore, it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme is, in <hi>this,</hi> directly inconſiſtent with the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And therefore, if the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> came from God, their Scheme in this <hi>fundamental Maxim,</hi> and in all that depends upon it, is falſe.</p>
            <p>THIS is a <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>eaſy</hi> Way to confute the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> Scheme, quite level with the Capacity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, who are not ſo well able to attend to a long Chain of Arguments. And it was deſigned by
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007618_0042_102B87CC5F5D9250"/>a God of infinite Wiſdom, who knows how to let in Light upon weak and ignorant Minds, in Effect, for this very Purpoſe. For it was deſigned to convince Men, that, in Themſelves, they are abſolutely loſt and undone.—And every Thing meets in this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of confuting the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme, which could be deſired, to give the fulleſt Satisfaction to the Minds of Men. For the Argument is not founded upon, here and there, a dark Text of Scripture, of doubtful Signification, and ſeemingly capable of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral different Meanings; but upon the plain Nature of the whole <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation; upon Facts, ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to be acknowledged on all Hands. Nor is there ſo much as Room left to ſuſpect, that we miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation, and view the Facts in a wrong Light, inaſmuch as St. <hi>Paul</hi> has led the Way before us, and, under divine Inſpiration, has ſhewn this to be the Nature and Deſign of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation, viewing the Facts in the ſame Light, and arguing from them in the ſame Manner, as has been already obſerved. That if we may give Credit to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or to the great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or to a Method of Reaſoning full of Light and Demonſtration, or to all together, we may ſit down here fully ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>AND as the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are in a perfect Harmony; and, as on this Account, what is inconſiſtent with one, muſt be with the other: So it is manifeſt from the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reaſoning, that the aforeſaid <hi>Arminian</hi> Maxim is quite inconſiſtent with the Goſpel. For, according to that Maxim, Mankind have power to do that, which would entitle them to the Favour of God, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had never died. But, ſays St. <hi>Paul, if there had been a Law, which could have given Life, verily Righteouſneſs had come by the Law. And if Righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is Dead in vain. Gal.</hi> ii. 21. and <hi>Chap.</hi> iii. 21.
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>IF the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme is inconſiſtent with the <hi>Law,</hi> and with the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it will unavoidably follow, that the <hi>religious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,</hi> of thoſe who are <hi>Armenians</hi> at Heart, are not in Conformity to <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but of a contrary Nature; even, their <hi>Love to God,</hi> their <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> their <hi>Repeniance,</hi> their <hi>ſincere Obedience,</hi> and <hi>every other Branch</hi> of their <hi>Religion.</hi> The whole Spirit and Frame of their Minds is contrary to Law, and to Goſpel, juſt as their Scheme of Religion is. And indeed, the Scheme of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they have in their Heads, grows up out of the Frame of their Hearts. They are both of the ſame Nature. They feel, as they believe, <q>it is not juſt for God to require ſinleſs Perfection on Pain of eternal Damnation. If I do as well as I can, it is not fair I ſhould be damned.</q>—They would not love God, if they did not think he was of their Opinion. Their Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and their Hopes of Heaven, harmonize with theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and ſo does their Repentance, and their Obedience. So that if theſe Principles are inconſiſtent with Law and Goſpel, it will follow, the whole Syſtem of the Religion of their Hearts is ſo too—the Scheme in their Heads, and the Religion of their Hearts, being exactly ſuited to each other.</p>
                  <p>SOME Comfort themſelves much, that the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had ſo low an Opinion of, had nothing of the Nature of true Virtue in it; ſuppoſing this to be the only Reaſon they could not be juſtified by it. Little thinking, that, it is their own Caſe. That there is not the leaſt real Goodneſs in all their Religion.—But it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo, that what is <hi>highly eſteemed among Men, is Abomination in the Sight of God. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

For, while they maintain, "that God cannot juſtly require more of us than we can do Our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves," they add, "that we did not need <hi>Chriſt</hi> to obey or die in our Stead," and accordingly, they ſay, "He never deſigned any ſuch Thing."

But here in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> every Thing was <hi>acted over,</hi> and that exceedingly to the <hi>Life.</hi> God ſpake the Law HIMSELF, and that with an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>loud Voice.</hi> It thundered and lightned, the Mountain quaked and trembled, God appeared like the <hi>Flame</hi> of a <hi>devouring Fire</hi> in the Eyes of all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And thus the Greatneſs and Majeſty, the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Authority of God were repreſented, and brought into clear View; and thus the Law was ſet home.— And Half the Tribes ſtood on Mount <hi>Gerizzim,</hi> and half the Tribes ſtood upon Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> and while the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> before all the Congregation, repeated the <hi>Curſe</hi> twelve Times going, all the People anſwered, and ſaid, AMEN.

            <p>THEY ſay, <q>'tis true, we cannot be juſtified by a Law that requires ſinleſs Perfection, nor do we expect it.

AGAIN, they ſay, <q>The Obedience of the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> was not ſincere. And that was the Reaſon they could not be juſtified by it. But our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſincere.</q>—But St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument was not—"your Obedience is not ſincere; therefore you cannot be juſtified by it."—But it was—"your Obedience is not perfect. Therefore you cannot be juſtified by it."</p>
            <p>AGAIN, they ſay, <q>Chriſt has purchaſed an Abatement of the Law. And promiſed Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our ſincere Obedience.</q>—But St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, "the Law is not abated one Title; but requires ſinleſs Perfection ſtill: And Curſes the Man, that ever at any Time fails in the leaſt Point. Nor will any Obedience juſtify, ſhort of Perfection."—So that, which Way ſoever they turn, St. <hi>Paul</hi> meets them. And there is no eſcape.</p>
            <p>"YES," ſay they, <q>we hold Juſtification by Faith, juſt as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did. By Faith, he meant, ſincere Obedience, and ſo do we.</q>—"No, no," ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> "if by Faith, you mean ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, you cannot be juſtified by it. For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly affirm, that no Obedience ſhort of ſinleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection can juſtify you. If you will be juſtified by Obedience, it muſt be perfect. Sincere Obedience will not anſwer. For it is written, <hi>curſed is every Man, that continueth not in all Things, written in the Book of the Law, to do them."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SEEING then, nothing is to be done with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but ſtill he will be againſt them, therefore they run to St. <hi>James</hi> to help them againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and look all over the <hi>Bible</hi> for Help. And ſo having ſtrengthened Themſelves, by perverting ſome Paſſages of <hi>Scripture,</hi> they venture out, and boldly ſay, <q>That if St. <hi>Paul</hi> does in Fact mean, that our ſincere Obedience will not juſtify us, he contradicts almoſt the whole <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> which conſtantly declares,—that Repentance is abſolutely neceſſary to Forgiveneſs—that we are juſtified by our Works and not by Faith only—
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007618_0048_102B87D2ED542BF8"/>that none but good Men ſhall ever be ſaved—yea, that keeping the Commands is what gives a Right to the Tree of Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>DOUBTLESS, theſe Men, had they lived in the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Day, would have been as zealous againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as ever any were at <hi>Galatia,</hi> or <hi>Antioch.</hi> Nor would his ſingle Authority have ſatisfied them. And, if a <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Sentence,</hi> of another Sound, at any Time, dropped from any other of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> on whatever Subject they were preaching, it would have been picked up with Joy, to prove St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Scheme to be ſingular.—It was this ſame Spirit, which obliged St. <hi>Paul</hi> to write this <hi>laboured Epiſtle,</hi> to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf, and eſtabliſh the Truth. And he plainly demonſtrates that their Scheme was contrary to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and pronounceth the Man <hi>accurſed,</hi> that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to preach it.—Vain is it, therefore, now, to bring in a detached Sentence, or two, from here and there in the <hi>Bible,</hi> to overſet a Doctrine, that, St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms and proves, cannot be overſet, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting both LAW and GOSPEL.—Theſe Men muſt prove, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words did actually mean ſome other Thing, or they muſt believe him to be right, or they muſt call his Inſpiration into Queſtion, as Some, of the ſame Stamp, did 1700 Years ago.— But it is not all the Wit of Man can ever ſhew St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words capable of any Senſe conſiſtent with the common <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme. They have tried, but all in vain, this many a Year, till many have argued Themſelves into downright Infidelity; for he could not have framed his Argument better, had he been to have written againſt <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> in its very preſent Dreſs.—As to the Sentences of a different Sound, here and there in the <hi>Bible,</hi> which they refer to, their Conſiſtence with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, hath been often ſhewn by Divines, and till theſe Men have, at leaſt, attempted an Anſwer, it is needleſs to

               </note> which, now at Length, I proceed unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. FROM what has been ſaid, we may learn, "That, altho', we are juſtified <hi>by Faith;</hi> yet we are
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007618_0052_102B87D6B92BC9B8"/>not juſtified <hi>for Faith."</hi> That is, our faith, conſidered, as Something <hi>holy, virtuous</hi> and <hi>good</hi> in us, is not that which recommends us to God, in Whole, or in Part. Nor has it, viewed in this Point of Light, <hi>any Hand in our Juſtification.</hi>—For</p>
            <p>THE true Believer, conſidered as in himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Relation to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> does, in ſtrict Juſtice, deſerve Damnation, after he believes, as much as he did before. The Act of Faith makes no Amends for his paſt Sins, none at all. The Account ſtands juſt as it did. Only, as he falls ſhort of ſinleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection every Moment; ſo every Moment he merits Damnation afreſh; according to Law: A Law <hi>holy, juſt</hi> and <hi>good.</hi>—And indeed, it muſt in Reaſon be ſo. For if we ſhould perfectly devote Ourſelves to God in Heart and Life for the Time to come; we ſhould but give God his juſt Due: For we are His: wholly his. But doing our Duty for the Future, cannot make up for paſt Neglects; any more than our paying the Debts we may contract for the Time to come, will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy for Debts contracted in Time paſt.—Beſides, our Sins are infinite Evils: But our Virtues are of finite Worth: But Finite put in Ballance to Infinite is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For when it is ſubſtracted, the Remainder is ſtill infinite. Therefore only the mere defects, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our beſt Services, our higheſt Exerciſes of Grace, in this imperfect State, merit eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nor does all the Grace and Goodneſs in us make the leaſt Amends.—So that the Believer, in his pureſt and higheſt Act of Faith, conſidered as in himſelf, without any Relation to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> merits eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; inſtead of Juſtification to eternal Life.</p>
            <p>OR, if we leave <hi>Speculation,</hi> and come to <hi>Experience;</hi> ſtill the Point before us appears to be true. "For the Believer feels that Hell is his proper Due, that very Moment he exerciſes Faith in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>"—For why elſe does he apply to the Atonement of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> For if he does not deſerve to go to Hell, he does not need the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſave him from Hell.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:007618_0053_102B87F61D236190"/>His looking to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith, to be ſaved from Hell ſuppoſes, he feels Hell to be his proper Due. Elfe, 'tis a mere Mockery.</p>
            <p>BUT it is plain from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> "That no Goodneſs ſhort of ſinleſs Perfection can entitle us to the Favour of God." <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is our Virtue, cannot do it, any more than <hi>Repentance,</hi> or <hi>ſincere Obedience.</hi> For nothing ſhort of ſinleſs Perfection can do it. But Faith is not ſinleſs Perfection. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot be juſtified on the Account of our Faith.—In a Word. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Reaſonings do as effectually prove, that <hi>Faith</hi> cannot juſtify us in this Senſe, as that <hi>Works</hi> cannot. And, indeed, <hi>Faith,</hi> viewed in this Light, is as much a <hi>Work,</hi> as any other Chriſtian Grace whatſoever, or as any external Act of Obedience a Man can do. And he that depends upon <hi>his Faith</hi> to recommend him to God, depends upon <hi>his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> as much as the <hi>Galatians</hi> did. He is in the ſame Scheme, only a little refined. There is no eſſential Difference.—The <hi>Galatians</hi> truſted in their own Righteouſneſs: So do theſe.—The <hi>Galatians</hi> nevertheleſs hoped and expected that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would be of <hi>ſome Effect</hi> to them, and <hi>profit</hi> them <hi>ſome:</hi> And ſo do theſe.—The <hi>Galatians</hi> had never had the Law ſufficiently ſet home upon their Hearts: So it is with theſe.—The only Difference is, that the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſeem to have truſted chiefly in their external religious Performances; and theſe truſt chiefly in the internal religious Frame of their Hearts. But, as there was Nothing of the Nature of true Virtue, in the Duties of the ſelf-righteous <hi>Galatians;</hi> ſo there is Nothing of the Nature of true Faith, in the Faith of theſe ſelf-righteous Believers: It being as inconſiſtent with the Nature of Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for a Man to make a Righteouſneſs of his Faith; as it is to make a Righteouſneſs of any Thing elſe.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be enquired, "in what Senſe then, are we juſtified by Faith?"—I anſwer.—When the <hi>Jew</hi> brought a Bullock for a Sin-Offering, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:007618_0054_102B87D8957CBB80"/>it before the Lord, and laid his Hands on the Head of it, that it might die in his Stead, and make an Atonement for his Sin, that it might be forgiven; if he acted underſtandingly, and uprightly, it implied, an hearty Approbation of the Law; which he could not have, without a ſupreme Love to God; which would naturally lay the Foundation for Repentance, and ſincere Obedience: Yet, it was not, that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Law, nor that Love to God, nor that Repentance, nor that ſincere Obedience, nor his bringing the Bullock, nor his laying his Hands on his Head, which was to make Atonement for his Sin; but <hi>the Blood of the Bullock:</hi> According to the conſtant Language of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>—So, altho' true Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> implies, an hearty Approbation of the Law; which cannot be without a ſupreme Love to God; which will naturally lay a Foundation for Repentance, and ſincere Obedience: Yet, it is not this hearty Approbation of the Law, nor this ſupreme Love to God, nor this Repentance, nor this ſincere Obedience, no, nor the Act of Faith itſelf, that makes Atonement for Sin; but only <hi>the Blood of Chriſt;</hi> according to the conſtant Language of the <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi> Nor are any of theſe, therefore, to be depended upon; but <hi>only Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>—Nor can Faith do any Thing towards juſtifying us, unleſs as it UNITES us to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For in the very Act of Faith, all Pretences to the divine Favour, on our own Account, are given up; and Hell is owned to be our Due. And we look only to the Merits and Atonement of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> —Leave all other Refuges, and fly hither.—Are <hi>divorced from the Law,</hi> and <hi>married to Chriſt.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Language of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>

            <p>BUT, inaſmuch as the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of a preparitory Work, is denied by Some, and the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, is ſtill more miſunderſtood; therefore let us ſtop here a few Minutes, and ſee what Light, the Subject we have been upon, will pour in upon theſe Points.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Preparation for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt, without Diſpute, be granted; or we ſhall undermine the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, which was, by God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for this very Purpoſe.—God intended that the Light of the glorious Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſhine into this benighted World—He <hi>intended</hi> it, in the Days of <hi>Moſes</hi>—But the World was not prepared for it <hi>then.</hi> Therefore, <hi>firſt,</hi> he gives the <hi>Law;</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points <hi>that,</hi> to be a <hi>School-Maſter;</hi> and keeps up the <hi>School,</hi> for near two Thouſand Years; to prepare the Way for the Goſpel-Revelation: That it might be the better underſtood, the more readily believed and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:007618_0059_102B87FBB9747730"/>embraced.—God ſaw many preparatory Leſſons needed to be taught, and that the Neceſſity was ſo great, as that it was beſt to delay the Goſpel Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and ſet up a preparatory School, and appoint a preparatory School-Maſter.—So that, there needs, no farther Proof, of the Neceſſity of Preparation, in Order to Faith in Chriſt; as the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation takes this for granted, and was chiefly deſigned to anſwer this End.
<note place="bottom">
                  <p>‡ OBJECTION. <q>IF every particular Sinner needs the Law to be his School-Maſter to bring him to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as much as the <hi>Jewiſh.</hi> Nation did; why was the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation ever to be at an End? Why was it not to be perpetual?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>ANSWER. 1. THE Law of Nature, requiring ſinleſs Perfection; on Pain of eternal Damnation, which was the chief Part of the Law given at Mount Sinai, all the Advantages of which new Edition, or Republication of the Law of Nature we ſtill enjoy; I ſay, this Law of Nature, as it was in Force, previous t the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, among all Nations; ſo it is ſtill. And by it, all Nations ever were, and ſtill are expoſed to the everlaſting Wrath of God, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were by their Law. Nor is there any Way of Eſcape, but by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now, here is a perpetual School-Maſter. <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 18. and iii. 9, 19. <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. BUT there is now no Need to offer the Blood of Bulls and Goats, or conſtantly to attend to and look upon, any other of the <hi>Jewiſh Shadows:</hi> Becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Subſtance</hi> is <hi>come.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>ceremonial</hi> Law is to be no longer in Force.</p>
               </note> For, as if any Man ſhould boldly ſay, that Mankind have no Need of a Saviour, it would wholly undermine and overthrow the Goſpel Revelation; which takes it for granted, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind do need a Saviour, and juſt ſuch a Saviour as is provided: So, if any Man ſhould boldly ſay, that Nothing is wanting to prepare a Sinner for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it would undermine and overthrow the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which takes it for granted, that Sinners did need Preparation, and juſt ſuch a Preparation, as that Diſpenſation was ſuited to work.</p>
            <p>Now, read through the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with the Hiſtory interſperſed in thoſe ſacred Books, of God's Dealings with the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thoſe Forty Years in the Wilderneſs; and it will appear,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:007618_0060_102B87DE1CF5F0C0"/>that the Whole is admirably ſuited, to realize the Being and Perfections of God; to ſhew us exactly how he looks upon Himſelf, and how he ſtands af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards Sin. "I AM THE LORD," He ſays, an Hundred Times, he ſpeaks it with the Majeſty of a GOD, and he ſhews an infinite Regard to his own Honour, and expects All to love and worſhip him, to fear and obey him, on Pain of Death. If his <hi>Anger waxes hot,</hi> behold! <hi>the Earth opens her Mouth, and ſwallows up Hundreds!</hi> Or, <hi>the Plague rages, to kill Thouſands in a Moment!</hi> And if he is pleaſed to have Mercy, and not execute all his Wrath; it is, like an abſolute Sovereign, over Criminals, that have no Claim. <hi>I will have Mercy, on whom I will have Mercy: And I will have Compaſſion, on whom I will have Compaſſion.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxiii. 19.</note> Thus they are in the Hands of a <hi>Sovereign</hi> God.—Mean While, the Law teaches, that no Mortal can, on the Account of his own Goodneſs, be approved of God, unleſs he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy in Heart and Life. And that, the leaſt Defect merits and expoſes to eternal Damnation. And yet, at the ſame Time, forbids a complaining Thought, and obliges to an hearty Approbation. Nor could the poor, guilty, helpleſs <hi>Jew,</hi> without an hearty Approbation of the Law, with any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency, lay his Hands on the Head of the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Animal, and preſent it to die in his Room. And yet, <hi>this was the only Door of Hope:</hi> For, <hi>without ſhedding of Blood, there was no Remiſſion.</hi> And now it is plain, what Views and Diſpoſitions, all this, effectually realized to the Mind, and ſet home upon the Heart, was ſuited to work.—<q>It would effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally awaken his Conſcience, and bring the <hi>Jew</hi> to feel, what he was, by Nature, and by Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, in the Sight of God, and compared with his Law; and what he ſtood expoſed unto; without any poſſible Way of Eſcape, but by the Blood of Atonement; which, yet, he could not, conſiſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:007618_0061_102B87FD5D22E490"/>have recourſe unto; unleſs, firſt, he heartily approved the Law, in all its Rigour, as ſtrictly juſt.</q>—And herein, as in a Glaſs, we may ſee, the true Nature of that Preparation, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in Order to exerciſe Faith in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND <hi>impartial Reaſon</hi> approves it all. For—is it fit the Sinner ſhould be pardoned, before he ſees and owns, what he is, and wherein, and how much, he has been to blame?—Or, is it fit, the Sinner ſhould be pardoned, till he clearly ſees he deſerves to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed?—Or, is it fit, a Sinner ſhould be pardoned, by God, the Lawgiver, before he ſees and feels the Law is <hi>juſt,</hi> by which he ſtands condemned; ſo as to ceaſe complaining; yea, ſo as actually to approve, juſtify, and acquieſce in it, as quite right and altogether equitable?—Or, can a Sinner, till then, ſee any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and rational Ground for an <hi>Atonement?</hi> Or, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his Need of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Or, ſee the true Beauty and Glory of the Goſpel-Way of Life? Or, heartily acquieſce in it?</p>
            <p>OR, may not theſe be laid down, as <hi>Maxims,</hi> near, or quite, ſelf-evident?—I muſt ſee, wherein I have been to blame, and how much, before I can ſee wherein, and how much, I need a Pardon.—I muſt ſee, I, altogether, deſerve the threatned Puniſhment; before I can ſee it, altogether, free Grace, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it. I muſt ſee it, reaſonable, fit and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that Sin ſhould be, ſo puniſhed, as the Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens; before I can ſee the Law, reaſonable, fit and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, in threatning, ſo to puniſh Sin.—I muſt ſee the Law reaſonable, fit and beautiful; before I can be ſatisfied at Heart, that it was ever beſt it ſhould be executed upon the Sinner, or upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Surety: —I muſt ſee it, to be of infinite Importance that God be honoured, and Sin diſcountenanced; before the Severity of the Law will appear beautiful, or the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> needful, or the Way of Life thro' his Blood glorious, or I heartily approve of the Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Now, theſe, and, each of theſe Particulars, are eſſential to the Exerciſe of Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for Pardon and Juſtification. Nor, need any Thing farther be added, in Order to determine exactly, the Nature of that Preparation, which is neceſſary, to the Exerciſe of Faith in Chriſt.—Preciſely, how much of <hi>this,</hi> is wrought in the true Convert, previous to <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and goes into the <hi>Idea,</hi> of what is called <hi>legal Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> and how much is conſequent upon <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>divine Light,</hi> and belongs to what is called <hi>evangelical Humiliation,</hi> I ſhall not ſtand to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:007618_0064_102B87E1F3CD7980"/>
(1.) IN <hi>General.</hi> It implies an hearty Approbation of the Law, and an hearty Acquieſcence in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; as being ſuited to honour God, and diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance Sin:—And therefore more <hi>particularly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) IT implies, a Conviction, and ſome realizing Senſe, of the infinite Greatneſs and Glory of God; as alſo a ſupreme Love to God, and Regard to his Honour. For otherwiſe, we can never approve the Law, from the Heart; nor will it ever appear beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, or agreeable, that God's Honour is ſo much conſulted and ſet by, both in the Law and Goſpel.</p>
            <p>(3.) IT implies <hi>Regeneration.</hi> Or, that a new, ſpiritual, divine Nature, Taſte and Reliſh, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us from God. For, there is no Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in unrenewed Nature, from which, a Man may have ſuch a ſupreme Regard to God and his Honour, as from the Heart to approve the Law, in requiring ſinleſs Perfection on Pain of eternal Damnation. The Law never appeared Glorious to an unregenerate Heart. But every unregenerate Heart is at Enmity againſt it. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 7.</p>
            <p>(4.) IT implies a Conviction, and ſome realizing Senſe, of the infinite Evil of Sin, as it is againſt a God or infinite Glory. For otherwiſe it cannot appear as an agreeable, amiable Thing in God to puniſh it with eternal Damnation: And ſo the Law cannot be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved of and liked.</p>
            <p>(5.) IT implies <hi>true Repentance.</hi> In that, we are thus heartily turned againſt Sin, to God, to be on his Side, to approve and juſtify his Law, and ſtand for his Honour. For now the <hi>Rebel</hi> is become, and has the Heart of a <hi>loyal Subject.</hi>—And ſo,</p>
            <p>(6.) IT implies a Principle of <hi>new Obedience.</hi>— Yea,</p>
            <p>(7.) IT implies the Seeds of every moral Virtue, and every chriſtian Grace. For, they are compriſed in a hearty Approbation of the Law, and Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence in the Goſpel.—And ſo,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:007618_0065_102B8801A92562E0"/>
(8.) IT implies, virtually, a Preparedneſs of Heart, to deny Ourſelves, take up our Croſs, and follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and be true to him at all Adventures.—A Character abſolutely eſſential to every true Chriſtian. <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 25—33.—And ſo beyond all Diſpute,</p>
            <p>(9.) Juſtifying Faith is an <hi>HOLY ACT.</hi>—And yet.</p>
            <p>(10.) IT implies, that we have no Dependence, no, not the leaſt, on any Goodneſs, of any Kind, which is inherent in us, to recommend us to God's Favour and Acceptance.—For,</p>
            <p>(11.) IT implies, that we ſee and feel, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation is, at that Moment, our proper Due, according to Law and Reaſon, according to ſtrict and impartial Juſtice.—Yea,</p>
            <p>(12.) IT implies, that we are ſo far from a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to think hard of God, and complain of his Law, as too ſevere; that on the Contrary, we are diſpoſed to think well of God, and to think the Law to be juſt what it ſhould be, quite right, altogether right, juſt and fair.—Yea,</p>
            <p>(13.) IT implies, that the Law, altho' a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Death, appears to be <hi>glorious.</hi> For, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it cannot appear fit and beautiful, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it ſhould be ſecured, by the Blood of the SON OF GOD. And yet, unleſs this does appear fit and Beautiful, the Goſpel-Way of Life cannot be heartily acquieſced in.</p>
            <p>(14.) AND if the Law, altho' a Miniſtration of Death, appears to be glorious, as it is ſuited to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God and diſcountenance Sin; the Goſpel will appear much more exceedingly glorious: as being wiſely calculated, not only to anſwer theſe Ends, to even better Advantage than the Law; but alſo to humble and ſave the Sinner, and glorify Grace.— And therefore, in the Exerciſe of Faith, the Goſpel-Way of Life by free Grace thro' <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> will be admired, loved, eſteemed, rejoiced in, as being full of the manifold Wiſdom of God; while we behold,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:007618_0066_102B87E46DAAE718"/>how Satan is diſappointed, God exalted, the Law honoured, God's Authority eſtabliſhed, Sin puniſhed, the Sinner humbled and ſaved, and Grace glorified, all at once.</p>
            <p>(15.) Juſtifying Faith, theſe Views and Tempers, being thus ſuppoſed and implied, conſiſts more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a cordial Compliance with the Goſpel-Way of Life, by <hi>truſting in</hi> and <hi>entirely depending upon Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>—that <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> typically <hi>ſlain</hi> in daily Sacrifices <hi>from the Foundation of the World;</hi> who, in the Fulneſs of Time, <hi>bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree—died, the Juſt for the Unjuſt</hi>—being <hi>ſet forth,</hi> as the Bullock of old, <hi>to be a Propitiation for Sin, that God might be juſt</hi>—and who is now <hi>aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to appear,</hi> as our <hi>great High-Prieſt, in the Preſence of God</hi>—and is <hi>able to ſave to the Uttermoſt, all that come to God by him.</hi>—So the pious <hi>Jew,</hi> with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and broken Heart, laid his Hands on the Head of the Bullock, or the Goat, which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before the Lord, to die in his Room. The conſecrated Animal was ſlain, his <hi>Blood ſprinkled,</hi> his Carcaſs burnt, and ſo <hi>Atonement</hi> was made. <hi>Without ſhedding of Blood, there was no Remiſſion.</hi> Even ſo now, we are juſtified by FAITH IN CHRIST'S BLOOD. i. e. by an entire Truſt, Dependence, Reliance, on the Atonement, Merits, and Mediation of Chriſt, for Pardon and Acceptance in the Sight of God, and for eternal Life.—This FAITH IN CHRIST'S BLOOD— is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Definition of juſtifying Faith.</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 25.—And</p>
            <p>(16.) It implies <hi>a firm Belief of the Truth of the Goſpel.</hi> For, otherwiſe, a Sinner, ſo wide awake, would not dare, to venture his Soul and eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, thus wholly and entirely, upon it, without any other Dependence.—And laſtly,</p>
            <p>(17.) IT implies <hi>a ſupreme Value for the Favour of God, above all the World.</hi> As this will naturally ariſe from a Senſe of his ſupreme Dignity, Greatneſs and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:007618_0067_102B880652B9CAF0"/>
THESE Things are all ſo eaſy to be underſtood, and ſo evidently true, from what has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, that they need neither farther Illuſtration, nor farther Proof.</p>
            <p>AND thus, from the Nature of the Law, and of the Goſpel,—from the very Frame and Conſtitution of theſe two Diſpenſations, we learn the Nature of the <hi>preparatory Work,</hi> and the Nature of <hi>Saving Faith.</hi>— And nothing can be more ſatisfactory than to ſee theſe two Things, which lay the Foundation for all experimental Religion, i. e. for all <hi>real Religion,</hi> thus growing up, as it were, out of the <hi>whole Bible,</hi> not reſulting from, here, and there, a detached Sentence; but the natural and neceſſary Conſequence of both Diſpenſations, jointly viewed. And this <hi>joint View</hi> ſet in a divine Light, by the great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> before our Eyes.—And thus, the Religion of the Heart anſwers exactly to the <hi>Bible;</hi> as Face anſwers to Face in a Glaſs. As it is written, <hi>we all beholding, as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the Lord, are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſame Image.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 18.</note> i. e. beholding the Glory of the Lord, as ſhining in the Law; which, altho' a Miniſtration of Death, was glorious: And in the Goſpel, which much exceeds in Glory: We are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſame Image, are transformed into an exact Reſemblance, into a Frame of Heart, that is exactly anſwerable.—This <hi>Image</hi> is begun at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and it increaſes, <hi>from Glory to Glory, by the</hi> continual Influences of the <hi>Spirit of the Lord;</hi> who begins, carries on, and compleats this glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.</p>
            <p>AND from theſe Things, it is evident, that juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith is entirely of a different Nature, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thing, an unregenerate Man experiences; who has neither theſe Views, nor theſe Tempers, which are implied in it, and properly belong to its Eſſence, And accordingly, we find, that he, who faith, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned:</hi>

               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> iii. 3.</note>—And particularly</p>
            <p>WE may now, in the Light of all theſe Truths, ſee, as in the Light of Noon-Day, that for a Man, merely, <hi>to believe that his Sins are pardoned,</hi> and <hi>that God loves him,</hi> has in it nothing of the Nature of <hi>juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Faith;</hi> but is altogether a different Thing.</p>
            <p>(1.) JUSTIFYING Faith is a <hi>Grace,</hi> it is an <hi>holy Act.</hi> But there is nothing of the Nature of Holineſs, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in believing my Sins are forgiven. Yea, many a graceleſs Sinner believes ſo.</p>
            <p>(2.) JUSTIFYING Faith is a <hi>ſaving Grace.</hi> But Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is no where promiſed to a Man's firmly believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sins are forgiven.</p>
            <p>(3.) JUSTIFYING Faith is <hi>wrought,</hi> and <hi>can be wrought</hi> in the Heart by <hi>none</hi> but the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> But this Belief may be the Effect of a Man's own Preſumption, or of the Devil's Deluſion.</p>
            <p>(4.) JUSTIFYING Faith implies all the Seeds of Holineſs in it, and ſo naturally lays a Foundation for a <hi>holy Life.</hi> But this Belief, as there is no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in it; ſo it may naturally lay a Foundation for a <hi>wicked Life:</hi> As it tends to embolden a graceleſs Heart in Sin.</p>
            <p>(5.) JUSTIFYING Faith implies <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and cannot exiſt without it. But this Belief <hi>may be</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. There is no <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Regeneration in Order to its Exiſtence.</p>
            <p>(6.) JUSTIFYING Faith implies <hi>a thorough Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sin.</hi> But a thorough Convicton of Sin would be a Hindrance to this Faith. If They ſaw how bad they were, they would not be ſo apt to believe their Sins forgiven. Yea, thorough Conviction would ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually prevent this Belief, and keep them from this Deluſion, and ſhew them their Need of <hi>Chriſt</hi> indeed. Sudden Terrors, without any deep Conviction, are Preparation enough for this Belief. Yea, the <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians,</hi> who think this Belief true Faith, are againſt
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:007618_0069_102B8808788E4198"/>any Convictions, or Terrors, as doing more Hurt than Good.</p>
            <p>(7.) JUSTIFYING Faith ſuppoſes, that eternal Damnation is ſeen to be juſtly due: Nor can there be an Act of Faith without it. But deluded Sinners may be ſtrong in this Belief, when quite ſecure in Sin, and at the greateſt Remove from a Senſe of their Deſert of Damnation.</p>
            <p>(8.) JUSTIFYING Faith ſuppoſes, that the Law is approved of, and loved. But this Belief may be in an <hi>Antinomian</hi> Heart, that hates the Law.</p>
            <p>(9.) JUSTIFYING Faith ſuppoſes the Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by free Grace thro' Jeſus Chriſt, is rightly underſtood; as it reſults herefrom. But a right Underſtanding of the Goſpel-Way of Life is not needful to this Belief; as it does not take its Riſe from the Goſpel, but from a new Revelation. Yea, a clear Inſight into the Goſpel-Way of Life, would do more Hurt than Good; as it would tend to convince them of their Deluſion.</p>
            <p>(10.) JUSTIFYING Faith ſuppoſes, that we believe the Goſpel to be true. But that Belief a Heretick may have. Yea, a profeſſed Infidel may have it: A <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Jew</hi> may as firmly believe that his Sins are forgiven, as any <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> And doubtleſs ſome of them do.</p>
            <p>(11.) JUSTIFYING Faith ſuppoſes, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is heartily approved of and loved. But this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is conſiſtent with an habitual Enmity to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as well as the Law.</p>
            <p>(12.) JUSTIFYING Faith hath for its Object, <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> But this Belief has for its Object, no Being; but only a ſuppoſed <hi>Fact.</hi> viz. <hi>That my Sins are forgiven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(13.) JUSTIFYING Faith, is that, by which, we are juſtified. But this Belief ſuppoſes the Man <hi>was juſtified,</hi> that his Sins <hi>were actually pardoned</hi> before he believed.—Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:007618_0070_102B87E87584CA58"/>
(14.) As juſtifying Faith is founded only on Truth; ſo this Belief is founded only on Falſhood.— And</p>
            <p>(15.) As juſtifying Faith is founded only on Truths revealed in the written Word; ſo this Belief is only on a ſuppoſed Fact, no where revealed in the written Word. Yea, contrary to the written Word, which teaches, that before Faith our Sins are <hi>not pardoned:</hi> But <hi>the Wrath of God abideth on us.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> iii. 18, 36.</note>
            </p>
            <p>(16.) JUSTIFYING Faith is wrought by the Spirit of God, <hi>enlightening</hi> our Minds, ſpiritually to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Truths of the Goſpel <hi>already</hi> revealed in the written Word. But this Belief is begotten by an <hi>immediate Revelation,</hi> of a Fact <hi>never</hi> revealed before.—Yea, of a Fact not true.</p>
            <p>(17.) JUSTIFYING Faith attaches the Heart to that whole Syſtem of Truths revealed in the Goſpel. But this Belief leaves the Heart open to Error, and inclines it to <hi>Antinomianiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(18.) IT is every Sinner's Duty, that hears the Goſpel, to believe on <hi>Christ</hi> with a juſtifying Faith, But it is not every Sinner's Duty to believe his Sins are forgiven.</p>
            <p>(19.) AN Averſion to the Exerciſe of true Faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> is a Sin in all Caſes. But a Backwardneſs to believe his Sins are forgiven, is no Sin, in one, who is unpard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed.</p>
            <p>(20.) JUSTIFYING Faith, the ſtronger it is, ſo much the better, always. But this Belief, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it is, in a ſelf-deceived Hypocrite, ſo much the worſe.</p>
            <p>(21.) JUSTIFYING Faith works by Love to God, as glorious and amiable in himſelf. But this Belief works only by Self-Love. As the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> at the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> were, from Self-Love, filled with Joy, in a Senſe of their Deliverance, without any true Love to God in their Hearts; ſo a Man may be filled with Joy, in a firm Belief that his Sins are forgiven;
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:007618_0071_102B880AE27FC1B0"/>and yet be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, to whom God ſware in his Wrath, that they ſhould never enter into his Reſt.</p>
            <p>(22.) THE true Believer naturally makes Holineſs of Heart and Life his Evidence of a good Eſtate, as this is the natural Fruit of true Faith. But this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief naturally leads Men to make, what they call, the immediate Witneſs of the Spirit, their only fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Evidence; as all their Faith, and all their Religion, ariſes from it, and is entirely dependent on it: And diſpoſes them to think Sanctification, a very dark, unſteady, uncertain Evidence; their own religious Frames being ſuch.</p>
            <p>(23.) THE firſt and fundamental Article of a true Believer's Creed, and that on which all his Religion and Hopes are built, is, that the Scriptures of the Old and New-Teſtament are the Word of God.
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 20.</note> But the firſt and fundamental Article of the other Sort, and that on which all their Religion and Hopes are built, is, that the immediate Diſcovery they have had of the Love of God, and that their Sins are pardoned, is from God.—Shake them here, and you Shake their very Foundation.—Deſtroy this Belief, and you deſtroy all their Religon and all their Hopes, and leave them quite uncertain in every Thing.</p>
            <p>(24.) IN juſtifying Faith the Believer is married to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becomes One with him; and ſo is intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all his Benefits. But in this Belief, They are perſuaded, that the Benefits of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are Theirs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ever married to Him.—To render this perfectly familiar to the weakeſt Capacity, let me add, —That the Church, in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is called, <hi>the Bride, the Lamb's Wife.</hi> And being thus united to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is conſidered, as being <hi>IN CHRIST,</hi> and ſo intereſted in all his Benefits.—Now there ariſes this <hi>Queſtion— What is the Nature of that Faith, whereby the Soul is thus united to Chriſt?</hi>—When a Woman is married to a Man, there is, (1.) the Tranſaction itſelf, in and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:007618_0072_102B87EAB2A20940"/>by which, they are married. (2.) A Conſciouſneſs of the Tranſaction, at that Time. (3.) A Remembrance of it afterwards. (4.) Duties and Privileges flowing from it. So it is in true Faith.—But what if a Woman ſhould take it in her Head, without ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married, to believe, (1.) ſuch a Man is my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. (2.) He has paid all my Debts and given me all his Eſtate.—<hi>Objection.</hi> No, but <hi>you are not married to him.—Anſwer.</hi> Yes, I am. For Marriage conſiſts in believing he is my Huſband, and has paid all my Debts.—Might it not in this Caſe be affirmed?— <hi>Believing I am married, is not the whole Eſſence of the Marriage-Covenant, nor any Part of it.</hi>—So it is equally plain and certain, that—<hi>believing that Chriſt is mine, and that my Sins are pardoned, is not the whole Eſſence of juſtifying Faith, nor any Part of it.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Altho' it appears, ſo clear a Caſe, that juſtifying Faith, and a <hi>mere Belief that my Sins are pardoned,</hi> are two diſtinct, different Things, in their whole Nature and Effects; ſo that, it ſeems ſtrange, how they ſhould be taken for One and the ſame Thing, unleſs where Men are biaſſed by their own corrupt Experiences: Yet, ſtill I have Charity for ſome <hi>Divines,</hi> who ſeem to think, that juſtifying Faith conſiſts in ſuch a Belief, hoping they have a <hi>better Faith</hi> in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> than <hi>that,</hi> which they deſcribe in their <hi>Books,</hi>—But their being good Men, does not make this Notion of Faith, ever the better; but on the Contrary, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of its doing Miſchief in the World, is greatly increaſed, when it is eſpouſed and recommended by Men of great Names. And, therefore, there is the greater Reaſon, and the more Need, ſo particularly, to point out its Difference from <hi>true Faith.</hi>
               </note> To proceed</p>
            <p n="5">5. FROM what has been ſaid, the following <hi>Caſe of Conſcience</hi> may be eaſily and ſafely reſolved.—viz.—<q>A Man is greatly at a Loſs about the State of his Soul. He has been awakened, and has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and has frequently had ſomething like Communion with God. He makes Conſcience of all his Ways. And yet, for ſeveral Reaſons, is at a great Loſs, whether, what he has experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, be a <hi>common,</hi> or <hi>ſaving Work of the Spirit.</hi>— He opens his Caſe to his chriſtian Friends; they are afraid to ſpeak comfortably, leſt it ſhould ſettle
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:007618_0073_102B880CC3B003F8"/>him down on a falſe Foundation, if all ſtill be wrong. But they dare by no Means ſpeak diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging; becauſe, according to his Account, his Caſe is hopeful, altho' not clear. So they know not what to ſay.—Now what is the beſt Advice that can be given to a Man in ſuch a Caſe?</q>
            </p>
            <p>TELL him, that altho' he is at a <hi>Loſs,</hi> about his State; yet theſe <hi>three</hi> Things he may be <hi>certain</hi> of. They are true, and may be depended upon. viz. He is a Sinner—the Goſpel is true—and it is his Duty to comply with it.—Thus tenderly addreſs him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Altho' you are Conſcientious in all your Ways, yet you know, you have been, and ſtill are a Sinner. Your Heart is not what it ought to be. Your Temper towards God, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and divine Things is not as it ſhould be. Nor do you take that Pains in the Uſe of Means, in Prayer, Meditation, keeping the Heart, &amp;c. as you might.—You are to blame.—You are wholly to blame.—God is righteous in his preſent Dealings with you.—Yea, you deſerve infinitely worſe than all this: Even, to be ſent immediately to Hell.— Wherefore, ſee it; own it; come down, and lie in the Duſt at the Foot of God. And learn habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to underſtand, realize and approve of God's Law, as holy, juſt and good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>AND, as it is true, that you are a Sinner, and deſerve Hell; ſo it is equally true, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has died for Sinners, and God is ready, thro' him, to be reconciled to all that believe.—And the Truth of theſe glad Tidings may be depended upon. And you cannot reaſonably deſire, that God ſhould be reconciled to you, in any other Way than this, which is ſo perfectly adapted and ſuited to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, diſcountenance Sin, humble the Sinner and glorify Grace.</q>
            </p>

               <q>Now whether you was ever ſavingly converted or not; yet it is equally your Duty, in a Senſe, that Hell is your proper Due, and that you are
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:007618_0074_102B87EC441D15D8"/>abſolutely helpleſs and undone in Yourſelf, and in a firm Belief of the Truth of the Goſpel, to apply to the great Atonement of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to look to the free Grace of God thro' him, for Mercy to pardon, and Grace to help according to all your Needs.—And thro' <hi>Chriſt</hi> to devote and give up Yourſelf to God, to love him, live to him, and to be for ever His.—And in this Way your State may be cleared up, and your Doubts removed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>OBJECTION. But is there not Danger, that all This may Jettle him down on a falſe Hope; if as yet be never was converted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANSWER.</hi> (1.) IF he never was converted, then he never yet heartily approved of the Law, or really believed the Goſpel, or ever heartily complied with it. Therefore, putting him upon theſe Things, will tend to convince him, that he never did. For it will tend to ſhow him, that it is <hi>not in his Heart to do it.</hi> And conſequently, that there is <hi>no Seed of Grace</hi> there: But that he is quite <hi>dead in Sin.</hi> And that, therefore, unleſs <hi>he is born again, he ſhall never ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi>—I ſay, it will tend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of all this; and if, after all, he remains unconvinced, the Fault will be his own.</p>
            <p>(2.) IF he has been ſavingly converted, then this Method of dealing with him, will be like pointing out the Way to One loſt in a Wilderneſs.—He likes the Directions—he takes them—he haſtens towards the Road—he finds it—he remembers it—he rejoices —and takes better Heed to keep the right Path thro' the Reſt of his Journey. For the true Convert, altho' under great Backſlidings, has ſtill the <hi>Root</hi> of the Matter in him. Has it in his Heart to juſtify the Law, to be pleaſed with the Goſpel-Way of Life, and to look to free Grace through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for all Things.—Like <hi>Jonah</hi> in the <hi>Belly of Hell,</hi> when the <hi>Weeds wrapt about his Head,</hi> and he was ready to ſay, that he was <hi>caſt out of God's Sight;</hi> and his Soul <hi>fainted within him.</hi> Then he <hi>remembred God,</hi> and <hi>looked
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:007618_0075_102B880E5BB04D78"/>again towards his holy Temple,</hi> where God dwelt in the Cloud of Glory over the Mercy-Seat, under which the Law was laid up in the Ark, in the moſt holy Place of the HOLY of HOLIES, into which the High-Prieſt entered once a Year with the Blood of Atonement.—He looked <hi>hither</hi>—his former Ideas of God revived: He <hi>remembered</hi> the Lord: And a Senſe of God, as <hi>there</hi> manifeſted, encouraged him to pray. —He prayed, and God heard him, and delivered him out of all his Diſtreſſes.—And many a poor broken hearted Backſlider has done in like Manner, and found it <hi>good to draw near to the Lord.</hi> And thus the Truth clearly held forth to the Conſcience, as it tends to kill the falſe Hopes of a ſelf-deceived Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite; ſo it tends to awaken and encourage the true Saint to ſuch Exerciſes of Grace, as may be plainly diſcernible, and lay a Foundation for a full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. To conclude</p>
            <p n="6">6. FROM what has been ſaid, "the true State of the Chriſtleſs Sinner appears in a clear Light." For, while we view the Sinner, as under a Law, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſinleſs Perfection under Pain of eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, we may eaſily ſee how the Caſe ſtands with him.—He is under the Curſe—he cannot obtain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, by any Works of Righteouſneſſ, which he can do—he daily runs deeper into Debt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>—he has no Claim to any Mercy, of any Kind, temporal, or ſpiritual—till he ſees this to be his Caſe, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily approves the Law, by which he ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, it is impoſſible he ſhould ſee his Need of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or approve of or fall in with, the Way of Salvation by him.</p>

            <p>"WHEN he ſees this to be his Caſe, and heartily approves the Law by which he ſtands condemned;" then, and not till then, is there any Door of Hope, or any Way of Eſcape. But he is <hi>ſhut up under Sin.</hi>

            <p>HE cannot <hi>approve</hi> of the Goſpel. For this would imply an hearty Approbation of the Law. If it does not appear reaſonable, fit and beautiful, that he ſhould be puniſhed, as the Law threatens; it cannot appear

            <p>THEREFORE, he cannot <hi>acquieſce,</hi> heartily acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce, in ſuch a Way of Life. It does not ſuit his Heart. He is not pleaſed with it.</p>
            <p>AND ſo he can have <hi>no genuine Diſpoſition</hi> to look to, and truſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as ſet forth in the Goſpel, the whole Plan being virtually diſliked, while it does not appear beſt, and a Thing deſireable, that Sin ſhould be puniſhed with ſo great Severity.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he muſt remain in profound Darkneſs, ſhut up under Sin, bound down under Wrath, and in fearful Expectations of everlaſting Deſtruction, until his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed Heart is humbled.</hi>
