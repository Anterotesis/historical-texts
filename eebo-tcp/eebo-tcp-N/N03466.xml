            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Par of Exchange,</hi> is the intrinſick Value (in Weight and Fineneſs) of the <hi>Silver Coin</hi> or Denominations of one Country, reduced to the like Value of Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of another Country. Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Table of the Aſſays, Weights, and ſterling Values of foreign Coins, publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot,</hi> A 1727, is a proper Standard. From this no Country ſwerves, excepting by a ſmall Variation, called, the <hi>Difference of Exchange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Difference of Exchange,</hi> is a ſmall <hi>Premium</hi> allowed for the Trouble and Riſque of having Silver (that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Staple and Medium of Trade) remitted to anſwer the <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi>; according as the Imports and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Countries in other Goods, do exceed one the other. The printed <hi>Prices current</hi> of ſeveral trading Towns, from Time to Time informs us of this.</p>
            <p>Originally the <hi>nummary Denomination of Silver,</hi> ſeems to have been the ſame as its Weight or <hi>ponderal Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> It would have been happy and <hi>facile</hi> for the World, if it had ſo continued; but from the <hi>corrupt civil Adminiſtrations</hi> (not from the Ballance of Trade) from Time to Time, in all Countries, the Value of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary from that of the ponderal Denomination has been altered, <hi>to Defraud Creditors,</hi> and more eſpecially to cheat the Creditors of the publick.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> for many Ages before the 14th <hi>Century,</hi> the <hi>nummary Pound</hi> was the ſame with the Pound weight of Silver (this was in a proper Senſe the <hi>natural Pound</hi>) that is a computative <hi>Pound</hi> Sterling was 12 <hi>Oz</hi> of Silver, a <hi>Mark,</hi> or 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the arbitrary Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, it fell more and more, and <hi>A</hi> 1546 it was only 40 <hi>Gr; A</hi> 1551 by the bad Adminiſtration of the <hi>Duke of Somerſet</hi> Lord Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in the Minority of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. it was reduced to 20 <hi>Gr.</hi> but immediately after the <hi>Duke of Somerſet's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beheaded, it roſe to 88 <hi>Gr.</hi> and remained ſo, until <hi>A.</hi> 1601 it ſuffered a ſmall Reduction to 86 <hi>Gr.</hi> where it continues to this Day. Thus <hi>our preſent nummary Pound</hi> contains only about 4 <hi>Oz. of Silver,</hi> that is only one Third of what it originally contained.</p>
            <p>In all other Nations the like has been done in bad Adminiſtrations. The <hi>Dutch Pond Ulams</hi> (6 Guilders) which originally contained 12 <hi>Oz Silver,</hi> at preſent is 2 <hi>Oz Silver.</hi> The <hi>French Livre</hi> originally was a Pound or 12 <hi>Oz. Silver,</hi> at preſent it is reduced to 4 <hi>Penny weight of Silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe almoſt incredible Depravations of the ſeveral <hi>nummary Denominations,</hi> had not the leaſt Relation to the <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> and the moſt conſiderable of them happened in Times prior to their ſeveral Nations being much concerned in Trade; excepting what happened in <hi>France</hi> in the End of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. and Beginning of <hi>Lewis</hi> XV. Reigns; <hi>Silver from a Mark or</hi> 8 Oz <hi>at</hi> 27 Livres <hi>was at length</hi> A. 1719 <hi>impoſed upon the People at</hi> 120 <hi>Livres:</hi> The Iniquity of the Adminiſtration, not the Ballance of Trade was the Cauſe. Trade has quite a different Operation, and in Fact ever ſince Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came extenſive in <hi>England,</hi> that is, in the laſt 180 Years, the nummary Denominations have loſt only 2 <hi>in</hi> 88 <hi>Gr.</hi> The Credit of <hi>Merchants</hi> in the commercial World is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſacred, than the Probity of <hi>Miniſters</hi> in the civil Adminiſtration, and is a Check upon them Ever ſince the <hi>French</hi> began to have Commerce truly at Heart, which at preſent they ſeem to have as much, if not more, than their Neighbours; that is, ever ſince the Beginning of <hi>Cardinal Fleuri</hi>'s Adminiſtration, there has been no Alteration in their Coin and Denominations.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Europe</hi> all Nations have had the Ballance of Trade ſometimes in their Favour, ſometimes againſt them; and each of them more or leſs at different Times; foreign Wars, civil Wars, Loſs of Trade, Increaſe in Trade; without altering the Value of their <hi>nummary Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in Reſpect of ſtandard Silver.</p>

            <p>In the <hi>Britiſh Plantations</hi> originally an <hi>Engliſh Crown</hi> was 5 <hi>s.</hi> Denomination; in Proceſs of Time, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Creditors at Home a <hi>Piece of Eight,</hi> which is only 4 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Sterling, at the Rate of 5 <hi>s.</hi>; ſome Time after that in moſt of our Colonies this <hi>Piece of Eight</hi> was paid away to their Creditors at 6 <hi>s.</hi> and would have gone further, by <hi>Perſons in Debt</hi> getting into the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Power of defrauding their Creditors; if the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants at Home had not procured an Act of Parliament called the <hi>Plantation Act,</hi> whereby a <hi>Piece of Eight</hi> in all our Colonies was fixed at 6 <hi>s.</hi> for 6 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d., per Oz.

Exchange</hi>: But in ſome of the Colonies <hi>(Leeward Weſt India Iſlands, New York, New England)</hi> not uſing Weight, they continue to carry on the Cheat by paſſing a light clipt Piece of Eight for 6 <hi>s.</hi> which is about 8 <hi>s. per Oz Silver</hi>; there being no Bounds to their Clipping, they were obliged to come into the Uſe of Weights, but continued the Ounce of Silver at 8 <hi>s.</hi> Denomination, is 50 <hi>per Cent Exchange.</hi> In many of our Colonies they have gone greater Lengths, and by Floods of <hi>provincial Paper Credit</hi> or Money, they have made vile Work of it; <hi>ſo that Exchange with Sterling is at preſent in</hi> Jerſies <hi>and</hi> Penſilvania 60 <hi>or</hi> 70 per Cent. <hi>Advance</hi>; Maryland 100 <hi>per Cent.; the</hi> New England <hi>Colonies and</hi> Nova Scotia 400 <hi>per Cent</hi>: South Carolina, 700 <hi>per Cent; and</hi> North Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina <hi>ſtill worſe.

            <p>I ſhall, here give ſome <hi>Inſtances of the bad Effects of Paper Currency made a legal Tender.</hi> The Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>France,</hi> after much Damage done to the Subjects in depreciating their nummary Denominations by <hi>recoinages</hi>; did <hi>A.</hi> 1719, to compleat their Miſery, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Mr. <hi>Law</hi>'s Project of a <hi>Paper Currency</hi>; Silver was baniſhed by ſevere Penalties, Paper was made the only legal Tender. The Operation was; the Nation reduced to the utmoſt Confuſion, Mr. <hi>Law</hi> and his Abettor Mr. <hi>D'Argenſon</hi> were diſgraced; Silver again introduced as a Currency, and the only legal Tender.</p>
            <p>Baron <hi>Gortz</hi> about 20 Years ago, had reduced <hi>Sweden</hi> to extreme Miſery, by impoſing <hi>Government Notes</hi> inſtead of Specie. Upon the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Death, the <hi>Baron</hi> ſuffered capital Puniſhment, this being one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Crimes alledged againſt him. The Paper Currency was called in; the Silver and Copper Currency was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, upon the ſame footing as before <hi>Charles</hi> XII. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
            <p>We have a very good Inſtance in one of our own <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies. Barbados A.</hi> 1702 emitted 16,000 <hi>l. Bills</hi> of Credit on <hi>Funds,</hi> to be brought in again by a <hi>Tax of</hi> 3 s. 9 d. <hi>on Negroes:</hi> At firſt they paſſed at a Diſcount, but no more being then emitted, and the Time of the coming in being at Hand, they roſe again to near Par. Encouraged by this, they made a large Emiſſion of 30,000 <hi>l. Bills on Land security</hi> at 4 <hi>per Cent.</hi> payable after 5 Years: Theſe Bills immediately fell to 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> below Silver; but by an Order from Home they were all called in ſoon, and their Currency became Silver Value as before. <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi> had not the leaſt Concern here.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>A Paper Credit</hi> well founded and under good Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and not larger than what the Silver Specie Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency will bear; has been found to be a very good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in Buſineſs, and it leaves the <hi>Silver Species</hi> at more Liberty to be uſed as Merchandize, and for petty Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In <hi>Holland</hi> all large Tranſactions are in <hi>Bank Transfers of Amſterdam,</hi> their Credit being better than that of the Government, and their Bank Money 3 a 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> better than the common Currency. The Uſe and Credit of the <hi>Bank Notes in England</hi> we all know, their Fund being a valuable Depoſitum, a Call upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion on the Proprietors, and about <hi>Ten Millions</hi> Sterling in the Government's Hands; yet their Notes are no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Tender. <hi>If Paper Credit exceeds a certain Proportion of the concomitant Silver Currency, its Effects are bad, and ruinous</hi>; by its precarious Loſs of Value. The <hi>Bank of Venice</hi> was originally two Millions of <hi>Ducats</hi> given in, and Bills to a limited Sum given out, upon the Security of the ſame: This Scheme was ſo good that their Bank Money became 28 <hi>per Cent.</hi> better than common Curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: from this good Succeſs the Government allowed them to iſſue out more Bills, only to the Value of 300,000 <hi>Ducats</hi>; this ſmall Addition brought down their Bills to 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Advance. <hi>N. B.</hi> By continued Additions they might have brought them down to Par, and from thence to a Diſcount, even ſo low as 400 <hi>per Cent,</hi> as is our Caſe at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Province Bills from the various Operations of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent large Emiſſions, diſtant Periods, and Periods poſtpon'd; are become</hi> 400 per Cent. <hi>worſe than Sterling, and above</hi> 200 per Cent. <hi>worſe than themſelves</hi> 25 <hi>Years ago.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All well regulated Corporations are reſtricted, to iſſue Bills or Notes not exceeding a certain Value: Thus it is with <hi>Engliſh Bank Notes, Eaſt-India and South Sea Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Bonds</hi>; leſt by too large Emiſſions, they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate their Notes and Bonds, to the Damage of the So<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciety itſelf, and Creditors. The <hi>King</hi> by an Inſtruction to his <hi>Governour</hi> of this Province, limits us to 30,000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> (to be underſtood Proclamation Money or its Value) for extraordinary Charges of Government.</p>
            <p>The principal Deſign of a Currency or <hi>Medium</hi> of Trade, is to avoid the Inconveniencies of <hi>Barter:</hi> Paper Currency in large Quantities does not anſwer this End; becauſe of its Fluctuation, or rather progreſſive leſs Value; which obliges the Merchant at length to return to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004238_0008_10042a6d690deef8"/>
again, as being ſafe and better. In <hi>South Carolina,</hi> the Quantity of Paper Currency has ſo depreciated itſelf, that all conſiderable Contracts, are made, not in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Bills, but in their Produce <hi>Rice.</hi> In <hi>North Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi> their Produce, they call <hi>Specie,</hi> is 50 to 100 <hi>per Cent.</hi> better than their Paper Currency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Silver</hi> is a ſtaple Merchandize, an adequate Pledge, and an univerſal commercial <hi>Medium.</hi> Our <hi>Province Bills</hi> have no intrinſick Value, and as a Depoſitum, are no better than waſte Paper; they are no exportable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and receivable no where but in <hi>New England,</hi> being only an ill contrived provincial or <hi>municipal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Barter</hi> is Merchandize (not ſo ſtaple, and more bulky and periſhing than Silver) exportable, and upon that Account preferable to Province Bills as a <hi>Medium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Virginia, Tobacco</hi> is their <hi>Medium,</hi> and anſwers bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Paper, becauſe it is an exportable ſtaple Merchandize. Let us ſuppoſe, that at any Time it ſhould become (as are our Bills) not exportable, and that Laws ſhould be made there from Time to Time, for planting of greater Quantities, to increaſe their Medium; it would become in Courſe ſuch a <hi>Drug,</hi> that more and more of it would be given, for a certain Quantity of Silver or any other Goods, and at length be of no Value; but if their Government being ſenſible of their Error, ſhould forbid planting above ſuch a Quantity, their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> would become good as before.</p>
            <p>As to the Quantity of Paper Currency which the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Currency will bear, without depreciating its Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; it is only to be learnt by Experience. In <hi>New England</hi> we found that <hi>A.</hi> 1713 there were 194,000<hi>l.</hi> in Province Bills at <hi>Par</hi> with Silver at 8 <hi>s. per Oz.</hi> When we began to exceed that Sum, our Paper began to looſe of its Value: Here we ought to have ſtopt and kept within that Sum in our future Emiſſions. <hi>New York</hi> never exceed 40,000 <hi>l.</hi> in Province Bills (at preſent only about 37,000 <hi>l.</hi>) and ſo kept up their Value at 8 <hi>s. per Oz. Silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The larger</hi> the Paper Currency of any Country, <hi>the more it labours,</hi> and is circulated to the greater Diſadvantage. The greateſt Quantity of <hi>Exchequer Bills in England</hi> (never were made a legal Tender but in Taxes) at one Time extant was <hi>A.</hi> 1716, being a 4,596,184 <hi>l.</hi> Debt, much of it contracted in the bad Adminiſtrations of the latter End of Queen <hi>Ann</hi>'s Reign; Notwithſtanding of their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004238_0009_10042a70e63255e8"/>
being above one Fourth of the Nation's Currency their being receivable in <hi>Taxes</hi> and all Treaſury Affairs, and bearing Intereſt 3 <hi>per Cent. per Annum</hi>; they began to depreciate, and the Government was obliged to allow the <hi>Bank</hi> an Annuity to cancel <hi>Two Millions</hi> Sterling Value of them, and 3 <hi>per Cent. Premium</hi> to circulate, and ſpecify the Remainder while above One Million, and afterwards only 1 <hi>per Cent. Premium. Anno</hi> 1702 there were extant <hi>Two Millions Sterling Value in Exchequer Notes,</hi> the Government allows the Bank 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to circulate them while above One Million, and 1 <hi>per Cent.</hi> when not exceeding One Million. Since that Time, if <hi>Exchequer Notes</hi> are at any Time uſed towards defraying the Charges of Government, they are honeſtly paid off next Seſſions of <hi>Parliament.</hi> The laſt Emiſſion of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chequer Notes</hi> was <hi>A</hi> 1730, being 510,000 <hi>l.</hi> towards the Charges of that Year, and were paid off <hi>A.</hi> 1731, the Year following.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Paper Credit upon future Taxes or upon Loan,</hi> would anſwer as a <hi>Medium</hi>; how is it that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>Europe,</hi> find it ſo intricate an Affair to raiſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for publick Charges in Time of War,or other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Occaſions? When attempted by arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, they always tend to the Ruin of the Subject: The State Bills of <hi>France</hi> in King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. laſt War, were ſold at 50 or 60 <hi>per Cent. Diſcount.</hi> Baron <hi>Gorz</hi>'s State Bills in <hi>Sweden</hi> were Part of the Crimes for which he ſuffered Death.</p>
            <p>Upon any extraordinary Emergency or Charge incur'd by the Government (we were by the King's Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on allowed to emit, not exceeding 30,000 <hi>l. Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Value per Ann.</hi>) it may be proper to ſatisfie it, by publick Bills of Credit, to be received again next Year in <hi>Taxes.</hi> This is only good Oeconomy, to lay Part of the extraordinary Charge of a preceeding Year, upon the Taxes of the Year following; they will be as good as Silver Caſh, or better, if the Circulation is encouraged by a 5 <hi>per Cent. Premium</hi> or advance Allowance in the Treaſury. By this good Management of cancelling the Bills in a Year or two, we kept up their Credit till <hi>A</hi> 1713.</p>
            <p>To emit large Sums of Paper Money, upon Funds of <hi>Taxes</hi> payable after many Years; or upon <hi>Loans</hi> not to be paid in until after 10, 20, or 45 Years, as are the laſt Payments in <hi>Maryland,</hi> is leaving a heavy Debt of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004238_0010_10042a7a217a3c78"/>
Funds and Loans, contracted by our own Extravagancies and perverſe Humours; as a Burden, to be diſcharged by the ſucceeding Generation. As it is a natural Inſtinct in Animals to provide for Poſterity, it muſt be deem'd very <hi>unnatural and wicked</hi> in us, inſtead of doing ſo, to contribute to their future Miſery.</p>
            <p>So much Paper as is current in a Province, <hi>ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is that Province in Debt</hi>; for the <hi>Funds</hi> Part, the Publick is in Debt; for the <hi>Loans</hi> Part, private Perſons are in Debt: It is a Contradiction co aſſert that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try my <hi>grow rich by</hi> (Paper Money) <hi>running in Debt?</hi> As neither Publick nor Private are now aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Debt, we may ſay of thoſe Paper-Money Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, with Regard to their Mother-Country; what is commonly ſaid, and is in Fact true of many of our Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers with Regard to the Merchants; if they would be rich they muſt run boldly in Debt, and not be aſham'd of being dunn'd.</p>
            <p>If a private Man's Notes or Bonds are negotiated at a Diſcount, he is deem'd a <hi>Bankrupt</hi> capable of paying only — in the Pound. So it may be ſaid of our Colonies, with Paper Currencies at a great Diſcount; and the Diſcount encreaſing daily, they are in a State of <hi>lawleſs Bankrupcy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Private Credit</hi> or Notes on a good ſolid Foundation, are <hi>better than publick Bills</hi>; the former cannot, <hi>impune,</hi> break their <hi>Faith</hi>; they are under Coercion: The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is the Dernier reſort and in bad Adminiſtrations fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently break their <hi>publick Faith.</hi> Hence, the Credit of a well regulated Commerce or Corporation, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that of the civil Adminiſtration; <hi>the Bank Money of</hi> Venice <hi>is</hi> 20 <hi>per Cent. of</hi> Hamburg 12 <hi>per Cent. of</hi> Holland 5 <hi>per Cent. better than common</hi> Currency.</p>
            <p>This private commercial Credit in all polite Nations, is ſo ſacred at preſent, that the <hi>civil Government ſtand corrected by it.</hi> The Generality of the <hi>united Provinces</hi> did <hi>A</hi> 1693 coin alloy'd Pieces called <hi>quaad Schellings</hi> at 6 <hi>Stivers,</hi> being near 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> above their intrinſick Value. The <hi>Bank</hi> retain'd their Integrity, and it again roſe to 13 or 15 <hi>per Cent.</hi> this obliged the Government to reduce theſe <hi>Schellings</hi> to 5 and an Half <hi>Stivers</hi> their intrinſick Value, and have continued ſo ever ſince, and the Agio of the Bank fell to 3 or 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> as formerly. <hi>A</hi> 1720, <hi>France</hi> being in the moſt diſmal Confuſion, by their Paper Currency, their Court was obliged to apply
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004238_0011_10042a7bdcb6ccb0"/>
to the Merchants and Bankers for their Advice, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Method to be uſed to find out the natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between publick Bills and Silver Species, and to <hi>limit their Paper Effects</hi> to a certain Sum.</p>
            <p>A plain Illuſtration, that Private is better than publick Credit, we have amongſt ourſelves. Our <hi>Merchant's Notes,</hi> ſo called, being well founded, were 11 and an Half <hi>per Cent.</hi> in <hi>Decemb</hi> 1737, will be 18 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in <hi>Decem.</hi> 1738, 12 and an Half <hi>per Cent.</hi> (3 7ths of them then paid off) in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1739, 19 and an Half <hi>per Cent.</hi> in <hi>Decem.</hi> 1740, 26 and an Half <hi>per Cent.</hi> in <hi>Decemb</hi> 1741, and 34 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in <hi>Decemb</hi> 1742, better than the preſent Value of our Province Bills at 27 <hi>per Cent.</hi>; becauſe they are continually growing better, until they come to their fixed Value, at which they are to be paid off.</p>
            <p>The Scheme for emitting of 60,000<hi>l. Bills of the new Tenour,</hi> equal to is 180,000<hi>l</hi> of the common <hi>New England</hi> Bills, by Undertakers or Subſcribers, probably will drop, and therefore requires no Diſquiſition: Only we may obſerve 1<hi>ſt.</hi> The Emiſſion is too large, and the Periods too diſtant. 2<hi>dly.</hi> The Subſcribers or Circulators require a good <hi>Premium</hi>; becauſe if let go, at the Rate of 27 <hi>s. per Oz.

            <p>A Glut of this Provincial confuſed Paper Currency, by frequent and large Emiſſions, did naturally make it a <hi>Drug,</hi> and cheaper than Silver the general Standard of Merchandize: So that the <hi>Merchant</hi> was obliged to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance upon his Goods, bought for Silver, &amp; ſold for this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and in Conſequence the Conſumer of them obliged to raiſe the Price of <hi>his Labour and Country Produe,</hi> paid in Paper.</p>

This is the natural Conſequence of large Quantities of Paper Credit in all Countries.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Extravagancies</hi> the Conſequencies of our Paper Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, hurt us as to the <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi> in both Reſpects: They encourage a Conſumption of foreign Commodities, that is, they increaſe our <hi>Imports</hi>; inſtead of employing our Paper Credit to procure Exports, and to ſet up <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures</hi> and other Improvements; it is expended in fine Houſes, Equipages, and Apparel, or to pay Debts contracted by a long Credit: The Hands employ'd in fitting out theſe Extravagancies, would have been more profitably employ'd, about Things for <hi>Exports,</hi> or in manufacturing ſuch Things, as would have leſſened our <hi>Imports.</hi>

               <hi>viz. The fine Figure Boſton now makes,</hi> in Houſes, Equipages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is owing to it. This is Truth, but not to be boaſted of, no Man is the richer

for theſe Extravagancies, he thereby ſtarves his Trade, and diſappoints his Merchants and other Creditors: We are not to judge by Appearances only; <hi>Boſton</hi> never was more extravagant and gay than at preſent, but never were more in Debt, never more incapable and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in paying Debts. From the repeated large Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Paper Credit, the Value of our <hi>nummary Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi> did continually become leſs, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants at Home were from Time to Time paid a leſs Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than they contracted for; thus, for a Debt contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 25 Years ago, he now receives only 7 <hi>s. in the Pound,</hi> that is the Debtor (defrauds) retains 13 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound of the Merchant's Money, and with this he builds fine Houſes, makes Purchaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>: Let us not boaſt of theſe Things, leſt it may be ſaid of our Poſterity, and of thoſe who are to enjoy them: <hi>Happy is the Child whoſe Father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Seeing then a Creditor paid in theſe <hi>depreciating De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations,</hi> does not receive the Value he contracted for: is it poſſible that any Man (if in his right Senſes) of a monied Eſtate, that is, in Caſh, or out upon Bond or any other kind of Debt, can deſire ſuch a Moth of a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.

            <p>Some harſh ſounding Words, are not deſigned as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi> upon this Country in general (the Country is not without its Merit, and their People in their natural <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> do excel) the Errors of all Countries in bad Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, are to be imputed, to the <hi>Iniquity</hi> of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, but not to the People in general.</p>
            <p>There has lately appeared here in print a ſmall Piece (<hi>Some Obſervations,</hi> &amp;c.) in Favour of a Paper Curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: But unluckily for the Author and his Cauſe, moſt of his Arguments, when cleared of unnatural Incumbrances, recoil upon himſelf, and they point out the many Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which attend a large publick Paper Credit. As it ſeems deſigned for the Vulgar great and ſmall; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, what I have already related, is a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the whole; I muſt by a cloſer Application, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort his Arguments.

obſerve, that in all his ſpacious Calculations, he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make Uſe of Silver at a certain Value, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable at certain Periods, as a <hi>Baſis</hi>; neglecting his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Paper Currency's Uncertainties, as not qualified for a proper Foundation.</p>
            <p>He introduces theſe Words, <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> upon all Occaſions, with no true Meaning and Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi> is Caſh (Silver and Gold) impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, or exported from a Country, according as the general Exports or Imports of Merchandize exceed one the other. The Silver and Gold which we ſend to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are no Part of the Ballance of Trade againſt us, being truly, as Merchandize only. <hi>England</hi> ſometimes exports <hi>Two Millions</hi> Sterling Value of Silver and Gold <hi>per Ann.</hi> to <hi>Holland, Eaſt Indies,</hi> &amp;c. by way of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize; the Ballance of Trade continuing in Favour of <hi>England</hi> notwithſtanding. <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi> is alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Country, not only when they export their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, but alſo when the Country runs in Debt, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending in fine Houſes, Apparel, <hi>&amp;c</hi> that which ought to have purchaſed Exports; this is our preſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>The whole of his Book may be ſumm'd up in this Sentence, <hi>The ſinking Value of our Bills is from and in Proportion to the Ballance of Trade being againſt us.</hi> Is it poſſible that a Country ſhould continue to trade, or be capable of trading, when by the <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them, ſhould meerly upon that Account in 25 Years Time, looſe two Thirds of their Subſtance, as our Bills have loſt above two Thirds of their Value. In any Country if the <hi>Ballance of Trade,</hi> is very much againſt them for a Series of Years; their Merchants na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally become Bankrupts, to the Damage of their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Creditors; the Country looſes its Credit, and is no more a Place of Trade. <hi>Paper Money cannot ſatisfy a Ballance of Trade,</hi> it is not exportable or to be negotiated abroad.</p>
            <p>If we find that in all our Colonies where is no Paper Credit, that, the Value of their <hi>nummary Denominations,</hi> continues the ſame; and in all Colonies where Paper Currencies has prevailed, their Denominations have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated; Hand in Hand with their repeated Paper E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, ought we to have Recourſe to any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit (as Ballance of Trade) for its Cauſe, but only to the Operation of theſe Bills, would he not be reckoned <hi>a wrong Head,</hi> who ſhould aſign any other <hi>Regulator</hi> of

(that is the Demand is the greater) to carry on the ſame Buſineſs. <hi>A</hi> 1713, when our Bills began to depreciate, there was current in all <hi>New England</hi> 194,000 <hi>l.</hi> in publick Bills of Bredit, at 8 <hi>s. per Oz.</hi> (the Value at that Time) is 485,000 <hi>Ounces</hi> Silver Value, beſides a conſiderable concomitant Silver Currency: Our Paper Currency at preſent (Merchant's Notes not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded) is about 580,000 <hi>l.</hi> (triple the former) at 27 <hi>s. per Oz.</hi> Silver Value, is only 429,629 <hi>Oz.</hi> without any concomitant Silver Currency; ſo that our real Medium of Trade or Currency is conſiderably leſs at preſent, than it was <hi>A.</hi> 1713; notwithſtanding the emitted large Sums, of this imaginary fallacious nominal Currency. This is the certain and conſtant Operation of a publick Paper Currency in large Quantities, over all our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; that is, when it exceeds a certain Proportion; the more that is emitted the more it depreciates, and by continued multiplied Emiſſions, at length, <hi>Province Bills may become in Value equal to Waſte Paper.</hi>

            <p>I canot avoid, by way of Digreſſion, to make ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on <hi>long Credit.</hi> It makes the Unthinking buy profuſely. Whereas ready Money, or a ſhort Credit, would not allow a Man to buy and ſpend more, than his preſent Earning could afford, conſequently he would live frugally, and keep clear of Debt: Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities would not be imported in ſuch Quantities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not be conſumed faſter than our Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (our Returns) would admit of; and would anſwer the Intention of <hi>ſumptuary Laws,</hi> which our ſtated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on a trading Mother Country cannot allow of. Ready Money or a ſhort Credit, makes a quick Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the quicker the Circulation, the leſs Quantity of a Currency or <hi>Medium</hi> is required to carry on any Trade and Buſineſs. This would be an effectual Method, and equivalent to enlarging our Currency.</p>
            <p>He alledges alſo, that <hi>Shop Notes (another great Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance) were introduced from the Scarcity of Paper Curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> This is ill judged. Becauſe the <hi>Merchant</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a greater Advantage upon his Goods, than if ſold for Caſh; contracted with the <hi>Shop-keeper,</hi> to take it out in his Way by <hi>Tradeſmen's Notes</hi>: The Shop-keeper by impoſing upon the Tradeſmen and Labourers, Poſſeſſors of theſe Notes, found their Profit in it; this made the Shop keepers chuſe to buy, to be drawn out in Notes. The Factor alſo found his Advantage in it, by dazling his Employer with a large Account of Sales, &amp; by encreaſing his Commiſſions. This is become an <hi>Iniquity</hi> as it were by compact.</p>
            <p>He encourages the <hi>Rhode Iſlanders</hi> to more Emiſſions of Bills, '<hi>And they will find their Account in it, if they go on to emit a ſufficient Quantity of Bills.</hi>' He adviſes this Province to follow their Example, <hi>in emitting a great Quantity before it be too late.</hi> He does not conſider that if this Province were to emit a Quantity of Bills in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to what <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> have emitted, (<hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets Bay</hi> Colony being to that of <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> nearly as 6 is to 1) they would be ſo depreciated by their Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, as not to anſwer the End of a Currency, and oblige us to a <hi>Truck Trade</hi>; as in <hi>North Carolina,</hi> where their Truck call'd Specie, paſſes at a great Advance above their Province Bills; and in <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> by reaſon of their large Emiſſions, all conſiderable Contracts are made

in their Produce Rice, not in Bills. A Man of a landed Eſtate perſwades ſome Merchants his Neighbours and and Friends to accept his Notes for Goods and other Neceſſaries payable after 10 or 20 Years, and to circulate them all that Time without any <hi>Premium</hi>: And this Man a trading with theſe Goods to his own private Profit. It is ſcarce credible that there could be ſuch <hi>Infatuation</hi> on the one Side, and ſuch <hi>bare fac'd Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> on the Other. This is the very Caſe between this Province and <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> It is in vain to think, that we may follow their Example; it is impracticable ſo to multiply Bills to our Advantage, unleſs we could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade (it is <hi>Folly</hi> to imagine it) all our Continent Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to circulate them; <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> bears no greater a Proportion to this Province, than this Province does to all our other Colonies upon this Continent.</p>
            <p>He is an inexorable Enemy to Silver, for the following Reaſons, as he ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Silver has been and may be greatly depreciated by the Exceſs of its Quantity.</hi> Silver is of ſo univerſal Demand all over the World; that the continued Additions to it is like throwing of Water into the Ocean, making no ſenſible Alteration: But a continued Emiſſion of any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar provincial Paper Money, above a certain Sum, is like continued Pourings of Liquor into a Cask, which is ſoon full, runs over, and the Additions are loſt. In Fact, the computative or <hi>nummary Denominations,</hi> inſtead of containing more Silver, as it might be imagined from its Exceſs, do contain conſiderably leſs, <hi>v. g</hi> in <hi>England</hi> inſtead of 12 <hi>Oz to a Pound Sterling,</hi> as it was when Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſcarce, it is at preſent only 4 <hi>Oz</hi> when Silver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds: But, as we have already proved, this proceeds from none of the Qualities of Silver; it is meerly from the <hi>Iniquity</hi> of civil Adminiſtrations. The Silver Mines of <hi>Potſio</hi> are ſaid to have been firſt diſcovered <hi>A.</hi> 1545, the nummary Denominations, as to Quantity of Silver, varied much before that Time, and ſince <hi>Anno</hi> 1552 (prior to this our Import of Silver was inconſiderable) in <hi>England</hi> they have altered or varied only Two, in Eighty Eight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bills are a Commodity, not as a Pledge given but as Value paid, and therefore preferable to Silver.</hi> Is it not more natural to ſay, Silver is as a certain Value paid, as a Pledge, and as Returns or Merchandize; therefore it is prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to publick Bills, which are only as a precarious Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004238_0023_10042abac479a910"/>
paid, but no Pledge, and no Returns or Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bills are leſs bulky and more handy than Silver.</hi> Is a Shop-keeper's (whoſe Notes are already at a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) promiſary Note of Hand, better than a Bag of Silver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Notes on a fixed real Fund, are worſe than Notes that have no ſuch Fund</hi>; becauſe the former cannot grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beyond that fixed Standard: But the others being bad, may grow better <hi>in infinitum.</hi> This is ludicrous. I can anſwer only by a like Story: A certain <hi>Quack</hi> in the Cure of a ſick Perſon, being told that by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, the Patient did grow worſe and worſe: So much the better, anſwered the Quack, becauſe when Things are come to the worſt, then they will mend. The Truth of the Caſe is, the firſt can be no worſe, than the juſt Diſcount for the Diſtance of the Time of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the Others may grow worſe and worſe, <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we make Bills promiſing Silver or any Thing of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Value, it will occaſion their being hoarded up.</hi> It will be ſo, where there are alſo current Bills, promiſing a precarious or no Value; becauſe ſuch will be hoarded up by no Body, but be gladly parted with, even at a Diſcount, and Diſcount upon Diſcount, until we diſcount near the whole, that is until they are of no further Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency or Value: Accordingly in this Province, we are now arrived to a <hi>Diſcount of more than two Thirds</hi> of what theſe Bills were firſt emitted for. That a Bill without Limitation of Value or Period, and continually growing worſe, ſhould be preferable to a Bill with the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Period, and Value certain, and yearly meliorating, as are Bills on a fixed Silver Bottom; is a <hi>ſtrange Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</hi> Some keep up the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Bills and paſs away the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills; are the <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> Bills there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better than the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>? Amongſt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent publick Bills, what are tore and defac'd, or ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are paſſed away firſt; are they therefore a better Currency, than a good fair Bill?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There ought to be no Silver Fund for Bills, becauſe it will riſe the Price of Silver, to make good this Fund.</hi> That is, all our Banks in <hi>Europe</hi> are ill founded, both Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Private; becauſe they are all upon a Silver Bottom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:004238_0024_10042ac52bad36a0"/>
               <hi>To pay Contracts according to a fixed Weight of Silver; would have an unavoidable Tendency to raiſe the Price of it.</hi> It does not happen ſo in <hi>Europe,</hi> where Silver is their only legal Tender. In <hi>New England,</hi> paying of Contracts in Province Bills, does not riſe the Price of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Bills are better than Silver, becauſe they are by our Acts of Aſſembly a Tender, and conſequently muſt paſs: Silver paſſes only by Conſent, which may be withdrawn.</hi> That is, a forced provincial Tender, paſſable no where elſe, is better than a natural, univerſal, and legal (<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation Act</hi>) Tender, from which no trading Conſent ever was or will be withdrawn: And 27<hi>s.</hi> in Bills the preſent Value of One <hi>Ounce</hi> of Silver, is better than 27 <hi>s.</hi> which was the Value of Three <hi>Ounces and an Half</hi> Silver Twenty Five Years ago; or in plain Words, One is more than Three.</p>
            <p>The following Clauſes in his Book I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <hi>viz. Province Bills may be fixed to an aſſigned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and ſo be made a juſt Meaſure or Standard of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of all Things bought or ſold, which Silver cannot be. —When Silver falls the Government may ſtop it at any fixed Rate, and make that the Silver Pound or legal Tender. Why not alſo when Silver riſes if it were practicable. —Lowering the Price of Silver in</hi> England, <hi>where the nummary Denomination continues of the ſame Weight in our Coin,</hi> it is a Contradiction in itſelf. — <hi>By Means of a Paper Currency, to introduce Silver to paſs current.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He concludes thus. That he might now ſhew, how the Bills of the old Tenour, might be qualified, for the true Ends and Uſes thereof; and the like of private Notes of the ſame Nature, but having exceeded the Bounds of a Letter, he muſt forbear. <hi>Cui bono</hi> is the whole, ſince he concludes without entring upon the main and only Affair?</p>
            <p>Moſt <hi>political</hi> Affairs have ſome Reſemblance, to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>oſcillatory</hi> Motions, when got to their Extent on the one Side; they muſt return gradually and in the ſame Path to the other Side. Large Emiſſions of a bad Currency, long Credit, Inſenſibility of Diſcredit, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Extravigance, and Intemprance, have carried us to the Extent of bad Circumſtances: We muſt return by
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004238_0025_10042ac8b5a07078"/>
gradually cancelling our bad Medium, by ſhortning our Credit, by being more upon the Punctos of Honour and Honeſty, by being more induſtrious, by being more Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and by abandoning the plentiful Uſe of <hi>Rum,</hi> that execrable Bane of all our Plantations, and perniciouſly recommended by ſome of our Practitioners in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> as more wholeſome than Wine.</p>
