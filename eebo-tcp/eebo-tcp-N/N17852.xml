            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS precept of the Apoſtle is plain, and being delivered under the authority of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, is infinitely binding.</p>
            <p>THE great duty which it teaches us, is, to regard with a benevolent affection, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote with correſpondent engaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the temporal, ſocial, and ſpiritual intereſts of our fellow men. Though the precept does not prohibit a ſuitably ſubordinate care for our own welfare, ſo far as it can be conſulted, in conſiſtency with the claims of benevolence to others; it particularly inculcates, a diſintereſted
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023135_0003_0FBC83AF6F4ADF60"/>concern for, and ſuitable exertions to advance, as in itſelf a diſtinct, and deſirable object, the good of others. For by the things of others is undoubtedly meant their good, compriſing their external proſperity, their peace, reputation, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial comfort, and whatever is abſolutely valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them. This good of others, as in itſelf a valuable object, the Apoſtle directs us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. As the object is of a diſintereſted nature, the affection enjoined muſt be diſintereſted. From the text then, this doctrine may be fairly drawn, that DISINTERESTED love is at the foundation of the Chriſtian character, and abſolutely binding on all mankind.</p>
            <p>IN the proſecution of the diſcourſe, I ſhall
<list>
                  <item>I. ENDEAVOUR to give you an explanation of what is meant by Diſintereſted Love, by exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting its nature, and the manner in which it will operate and expreſs itſelf.</item>
                  <item>II. PROVE the doctrine.</item>
                  <item>III. ATTEMPT to anſwer ſome objections which have been raiſed againſt it; and then cloſe with an improvement.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I AM to give you an explanation of what is meant by Diſintereſted Love, by exhibiting its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the manner in which it will operate and expreſs itſelf. The term diſintereſted is not found in the Scriptures. We however make uſe of it, to communicate an idea of that love, which our
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023135_0004_0FBC83B2D87BE608"/>text and many other paſſages of the Bible enjoin, becauſe it more conciſely, and more forcibly expreſſes that idea, than it can be expreſſed in any other manner.</p>
            <p>DISINTERESTED love may be defined thus, It is a love to an object for what it is in itſelf; a diſpoſition to conſult and rejoice in its good, as an object, abſtractly conſidered. It is a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent regard, which one being feels for the good and happineſs of another, proportionate to its apparent intrinſic worth and importance, and is a rejoicing in, and ſeeking the good of that other, without any regard to perſonal benefit to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from it. Diſintereſted love is, in its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nature the contraſt of that which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted.</p>
            <p>INTERESTED love is a regard to a being merely on account of the benefits he confers, or which are expected from him: ſo that ſtrictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking the being is not loved but his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. In this, Satan ſuppoſed the love which Job appeared to exerciſe towards GOD conſiſted. Satan imagined that Job's dutiful reſpect to the DEITY was founded ſolely on the bleſſings with which GOD had favoured him, and that if thoſe bleſſings ſhould be withdrawn, and GOD ſhould lay his hand heavy upon him, in a way of chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Job's apparent love would become extinct, and his enmity riſe to a flame. ſee Job 1.9. <q>Then
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023135_0005_0FBC83B484B39918"/>Satan anſwered the Lord and ſaid, Doth Job fear GOD for nought? Haſt not thou made an hedge about him and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the work of his hands and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is increaſed on every ſide. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</q> This repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation exhibits the love of Job as ultimately mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary and ſelfiſh. Of this nature was that love, which influenced many of thoſe who followed our Saviour when they attended him with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of reſpect, not becauſe they were really attached to Chriſt, or the intereſts of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but becauſe they found their own tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ends anſwered by following him. This is clearly intimated in what Chriſt ſaid to them, <q>Verily I ſay unto you, ye follow me not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.</q> This love Chriſt ſpeaks of, as common to men in an unſanctified ſtate. He tells us that <q>they love thoſe who love them,</q> that they do good to thoſe who do good to them, and lend to thoſe, of whom they hope to receive as much again. Though they have a kind of love, it is not that genuine benevolent affection, which terminates in the good of others. It is of a ſiniſter nature, and in all its operations and fruits has an ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023135_0006_0FBC83B5FAA5BF88"/>direction to ſelf. All the views and aims of thoſe whom it governs, center finally in ſelf. Self is their GOD, their ſupreme object of regard, in whoſe ſervice all their powers are employed, and their zeal exerted. This love does not refuſe to embrace others, ſo far as they can be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the inſtruments of its own gratification, and as ſubſerving its own ſelfiſh ſchemes and wiſhes.</p>
            <p>IT may even lead the ſubjects of it to exerciſe ſome complacency in the DEITY, ſo far as their imaginations repreſent him in a partial view, and they can conſider him as the author of their pleaſures and as invariably conſulting their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. But it will go no farther.</p>
            <p>ESSENTIALLY and widely different from this, is the diſintereſted love which we are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to delienate. Self is not its object or its end. It is an enlarged affection of heart, which looks at the good of others ultimately, and for itſelf; under the prevailing influence of which, the ſubject of it rejoices, in the exiſtence, glory, and happineſs of GOD; in the exiſtence, exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and felicity of inferiour intelligents; and in all the bleſſedneſs which is ſhed abroad, or is yet to be extended through the univerſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by this love, he rejoices in the triumphs of redeeming grace, wiſhes for the beſt good of all around him, even of his bittereſt enemies,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023135_0007_0FBC83B719145D48"/>and feels a ſenſible pleaſure in every inſtance of the advancement of their temporal, ſocial, and ſpiritual intereſts; without taking into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration any ſuppoſed good to be derived from thence to himſelf. Indeed ſo ardently does he deſire, and ſo highly does he value this good of the DEITY and of his fellow creatures, that he takes his chief ſatisfaction in it. And ſo far is he from regarding others as only ſubſervient to his own intereſts, that he is willing to give up his own intereſt for the greater good of others. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry boſom, in which this love has the aſcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it will operate and expreſs itſelf in a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious obedience to all duty, at the hazard of reputation, property, and life.</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to GOD the ſupreme object of it, it will operate in a cordial complacency in his character as in itſelf infinitely amiable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. For a benevolent creature cannot but love a being perfectly benevolent, and <hi>GOD is Love.</hi> It will operate in a ſincere veneration of the divine government as a government uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equitable, and embracing in its nature and iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the moſt noble and benevolent objects. View<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divine adminiſtration as a ſyſtem of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and conſpiring to ſecure the greateſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and happineſs of the intelligent creation, the benevolent ſubject of this love will frequently, and devoutly adopt the language of inſpiration,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023135_0008_0FBC83B8708D42A0"/>
               <q>The Lord reigneth let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the iſles be glad thereof,</q> and join the rapturous ſong of the Redeemed, <q>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiah, for the Lord GOD omnipotent reigneth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS love will operate in an acquieſcence in the decrees of GOD; in the providential allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD, and make the happy ſubject of it willing to be in the hand of GOD, as clay in the hand of the Potter. For if the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in its execution, be a proper object of benevolent acquieſcence and joy, then it muſt reflect higher honour upon the DEITY, to have planned it from Eternity, than to have ſtumbled upon it by any fortunate contingence. And if GOD be infinitely lovely, as a holy and benevolent Being, then it muſt be grateful to every good man, that all things are at his diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, this love will lead the ſubject of it to ſubſcribe to the divine laws, as holy, juſt, and good; becauſe they are calculated not only to ſecure the greateſt good of the univerſe, but the temporal and eternal happineſs of every one who obeys them.</p>
            <p>THE man who is under the influence of this diſintereſted affection, will embrace objects ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their worth and importance. He will ſeek the divine glory as dearer to him than any of his own intereſts. He will be chearfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſecrate his all to this glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023135_0009_0FBC83BC0AD3E578"/>and to lay himſelf, with all his intereſts for time and for eternity at the feet of his Maker; and if his own welfare interfere with the great and benevolent ends of the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he will be willing to ſacrifice ſo ſmall a trifle, rather than thoſe ends ſhould be fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated.</p>
            <p>THIS love will expreſs itſelf in the outward obedience of a pious and uſeful life. He in whoſe boſom it reigns, will endeavour to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour GOD by an adherence to his worſhip, his inſtitutions and cauſe at whatever expence. He will be ſtrictly careful to refrain from all acts of impiety as diſhonorary to GOD, and injurious in their tendency. He will ardently pray for, and by actual exertion endeavour to be inſtrumental in the advancement of the Goſpel of the Son of GOD, as a ſyſtem of grace and happineſs; and nothing will give him ſo much pleaſure, as to hear of the converſion of ſouls, and the progreſs of grace in the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>TOWARDS men, this love reigning in the heart of a true chriſtian, will be a fountain of beneficent actions. It will incline him to acts of forbearance and forgiveneſs towards his enemies, to be tender of the reputation, peace and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity of all thoſe with whom he is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated in domeſtic and civil ſociety, or in the bonds of the Goſpel, and to maintain a harmleſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023135_0010_0FBC83BDD8BF28C8"/>deportment. It will not prompt him to reproach and calumny. It will not allow him to wiſh to build up his own temporal intereſts on the ruin of the reputation or property of another. He will conſider the peace and ſocial happineſs of his neighbour as dear to him, and will be ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous not to diſturb them. He will be happy to ſee them promoted and will rather ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf than be the inſtrument of his ſuffering.</p>
            <p>FARTHER, he will be active in poſitive exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to do good. His hand will be open to relieve the diſtreſſed. The hungry, the naked, the widow and the orphan; the family of ſickneſs and affliction, will be the objects of his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and charity. He will ſympathize with them under their affliction, and it will afford him ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id ſatisfaction to contribute to their relief. He will love the pleaſing condeſcenſion of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating council or inſtruction to them, or in any way promoting their felicity. The good of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, of uſeful ſocieties, and inſtitutions he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to advance; and above all, the eternal ſalvation of his fellow creatures, as that is by far the moſt important of all other ſocial objects, and in itſelf infinitely deſirable, he will ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray for, and to this will his exertions, his counſels, his perſuaſions and his example be chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be aſked whether this love to others,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023135_0011_0FBC83BF9D8E2980"/>and regard to their welfare, does not connect with it ſenſible pleaſure, and whether therefore it can be properly termed a diſintereſted affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>I WOULD anſwer. There can be no queſtion, but that the love which we have been deſcribing, brings with it, its own reward. It eſſentially involves in it a pleaſure of the moſt exalted kind. There is a ſolid joy attending it, which is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribably ſweet. Yea, the benevolent man's happineſs lies in the happineſs of others, and the more his heart expands with the love of GOD and his fellow creatures, the more happy he is. But this is the <hi>effect</hi> of the affection; not the <hi>motive</hi> or <hi>object</hi> of it. The good man does not ſeek his neighbour's happineſs that he may enjoy the pleaſure of ſeeking it. This would be contradictory. For, were this the caſe, his neighbour would not be loved at all in fact, only as an inſtrument of his pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. Diſintereſted love terminates not in perſonal enjoyment, but in the good of others. The man who is the ſubject of it, regards the good and happineſs of others ultimately. And though he feels the moſt ſenſible pleaſure in the exerciſe of his affection, and though it conduces directly to the ſecurity of his higeſt preſent and eternal intereſts, this is by no means the motive or object of it, but its ſpontaneous effect and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023135_0012_0FBC83C10AC23238"/>fruit. And when we ſpeak of diſintereſted love, we have reference merely to the object.</p>
            <p>IF any ſhould aſk ſtill farther, whether by diſintereſted love be meant, ſuch an entire and abſtracted regard to the good of others, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a total diſregard to, and indifference about our own <hi>good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT may be anſwered, that diſintereſted love, ſtrictly ſpeaking, has no ultimate reſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to ſelf, as ſelf. But while we contend for this, we do not mean to contend for it, to the total ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all regard to our own private good. A ſubordinate, an impartial, a diſintereſted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for our own happineſs, is conſiſtent with a diſintereſted and ſuperior regard to the greater good of others, and diſintereſted love will not give up or diſregard the former when it can be conſulted in conſiſtency with the latter. Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted love, being abſolutely impartial in it nature, cannot lead a man to an indifferency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his own private happineſs, but to value it, juſt as he would the happineſs of another in ſimilar circumſtances, and juſt as another perſon, diſconnected from him, and viewing things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, would value it. And there can be no doubt but that ſaints and angels in heaven, who exerciſe a perfectly diſintereſted and ſupreme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the glory of GOD, and the good of other intelligents, have alſo at the ſame time a real,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023135_0013_0FBC83C240A94408"/>though a perfectly impartial, ſubordinate, and vaſtly inferior value for their own happineſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hence the manner of expreſſion which the Apoſtle uſes in the text, "But every man <hi>alſo</hi> on the things of others," is ſo far from millitating as ſome inſinuate, againſt the doctrine of diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted love, that it rather corroborates it. For while it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly teaches, that it is our duty to entertain a due regard to our own happineſs, it teaches, that that regard muſt be imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or diſintereſted, ſo as to admit a due benevolence to others.</note> Subordinate, I ſay, for diſintereſted love will never allow private, perſonal intereſts to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the public, and more extenſive good.</p>
            <p>HAVING briefly ſhown you what is meant by diſintereſted love, and illuſtrated the manner in which it will operate and expreſs itſelf. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</p>
            <p n="2">II. To prove the doctrine, that ſuch diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted love is at the foundation of the chriſtian character and abſolutely binding on all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>THIS part of the ſubject, ſeems to divide itſelf into two branches.</p>
            <p n="1">I. LET us conſider the proof which may be produced to evince, that diſintereſted love is at the foundation of the chriſtian character. When I ſay it is at the foundation of the chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, I mean, that it is eſſential to all evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical obedience, ſo that without it there can be no genuine renovation of nature, or any ſaving conformity to the the Goſpel. And in proof of this propoſition, let it be obſerved,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:023135_0014_0FBC83C3B69B6A78"/>
I. THAT diſintereſted love is the love which the ſum of the moral law requires. <q>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy GOD, with all thy heart, and withall thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyſelf.</q> In this ſummary view of the moral law, the objects of love are, GOD, and our neighbour. In them our love is to terminate. They are to be loved ultimately as objects in themſelves conſidered, diſconnected from any ſelfiſh intereſts of ours, and without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations whether that love in its nature or iſſue will conduce to our own perſonal benefit or not. The command is unconditional and poſitive, in no meaſure ſuſpended on the condition of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to our advantage. And if the affection required, did not produce to us the leaſt degree of enjoyment for the preſent, or if there were no promiſes of future reward made to it, the command would ſtill be abſolutely binding.</p>
            <p>IT cannot be ſuppoſed that this command obliges us to love GOD only ſo far as he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to our enjoyment; and that the moment he counteracts our happineſs, even though it be in perfect juſtice, he forfeits all claim to our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This would, even by divine conſtitution make ſelf, the ſupreme and ultimate object of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. This would make us reſpect the DEITY only as ſubſervient to our wiſhes, and would be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023135_0015_0FBC83C531240C30"/>a requiſition of no love to him at all. It would totally preclude on his part all claim to ſupreme homage, and complacency.</p>
            <p>NOR can it be ſuppoſed that the command obliging us to love our <hi>neighbour,</hi> has an ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate reference to our own happineſs, and is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the condition of its conducing to it. This would involve a ſimilar abſurdity. GOD and our neighbour are therefore the expreſs and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate objects, to whom our love is directed in this ſummary of the divine law. And the reaſon of this is obvious.</p>
            <p>WE are under infinite obligations to love the bleſſed GOD for what he is in himſelf, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the infinite worth of his exiſtence, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and happineſs; and the infinite amiableneſs of his character. So abſolutely perfect, excellent, and amiable is that aſſemblage of divine attributes, with which the DEITY is clothed; ſo altogether equitable and benevolent his government, and ſo wiſe his laws and diſpenſations, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but that every intelligent creature, be his perſonal circumſtances and proſpects what they may, ſhould be under obligations to love him with all their powers, and to rejoice in him as GOD over all bleſſed for ever.—</p>
            <p>AND we cannot but be bound to love our neighbour, and in the exerciſe of that love to ſeek his welfare; becauſe his exiſtence and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023135_0016_0FBC83C8F635B750"/>are in themſelves of great worth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>DISINTERESTED love then, is the love which the moral law ſummarily requires. It is the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of holineſs and of all obedience. But the ſcripture expreſſly aſſures us, "that <hi>without</hi> holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no man can ſee the Lord;" That it is vain to call Chriſt Lord, Lord, while we do not the things which he requires; that the unrighteous mall not inherit the kingdom of GOD; and that thoſe who are peculiarly GOD'S people, have his law put into their hearts. The undeniable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is, that diſintereſted love is at the foundation of the chriſtian character.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE ſon of GOD has decidedly made the poſſeſſion of his ſpirit, and an imitation of his example, not only our duty, but abſolutely eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to our ſaving intereſt in him. <q>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt he is none of his. This is my commandment, that ye love one another, <hi>as I have loved you,</hi> and he that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and <hi>they follow me</hi>
               </q> Hence the apoſtolic exhortation <q>Let this mind be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt.</q> From theſe paſſages we are evidently taught, that all thoſe who yield any true obedience to the Goſpel, and are ſavingly intereſted in its bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023135_0017_0FBC83CA6ED63FE8"/>are, in a meaſure, under the government of the ſame temper, aims and affections, which actuated Chriſt.</p>
            <p>BUT will any man pretend that ſelf was the end of all our Saviour's illuſtrious actions? Will any man preſume to ſay, that in his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſelf-denial, acts of beneficence, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the agonies of the croſs, he was ſelf-intereſted? That in this aſtoniſhing exhibition of love and goodneſs, he ultimately regarded ſelfiſh objects? What advantages could that divine perſonage poſſibly obtain, who was in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, independent, and immutable poſſeſſion of all glory and bleſſedneſs? What intereſted ends could <hi>he</hi> poſſibly have in view, who was the ſovereign proprietor of heaven and earth, the eternal fountain of good; by whoſe agency all creatures are every moment ſuſtained, and on whoſe providence and beneficence they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely dependent? What ſay the ſcriptures? <q>For our ſakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might become rich.</q>
               <hi>This is love,</hi> love of the pureſt, and moſt impartial nature, <q>not that we have loved GOD, but that he hath loved us, and ſent his ſon to die for us for the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? The ſon of man came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt.</q> Now was all this love a mere
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023135_0018_0FBC83CC0BC7CAF8"/>ſelfiſh affection? Is it ſelfiſhneſs which we ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate in this divine Philanthropiſt? No. It is a fervent charity of heart, which ſought not its own. It is the charming dignity of an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſpontaneous benevolence, totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from any thing of a ſelfiſh nature; a benevolence ſtronger than death, and which ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the illuſtrious ſufferer, through ſuch a ſcene of humiliation, as the univerſe never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. Attend candidly to the mere language of theſe paſſages, and you cannot, you will not diſpute it. Conſider the aſpect of his life, and the hiſtory of his atonement. Give impartial credit to the teſtimony of inſpired truth, and you will acknowledge that it was an ardent, diſintereſted love, which ultimately reſpected his father's honour, the happineſs of the univerſe, and the ſalvation of precious ſouls, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the divine Jeſus to mount Calvary, which has gone with him to heaven, and which will for ever burn in his boſom, as a perpetual and inextinguiſhable flame.</p>
            <p>NOW as the members muſt be of the ſame nature with the head, as the branches muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the eſſential qualities of the vine, the conſequence follows, that diſintereſted love is at the foundation of the Chriſtian character, and eſſential to all ſaving conformity to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:023135_0019_0FBC83CD873E33C8"/>
III. THE examples of the Apoſtles, may be produced as additional teſtimony in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine before us. The Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in their public preaching, and the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actions of their lives, not a ſordid, narrow ſelfiſhneſs, which ultimately reſpected their own intereſts either temporal or eternal; but a diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted regard to the honour of their maſter, and the higheſt happineſs of their fellow men. That they were under the government of this noble propenſity of ſoul, they gave undeniable proof, in their voluntary renunciation of their worldly eaſe and temporal proſpects, and their uniform ſubmiſſion to every kind of ſufferings, for the furtherance of the Goſpel. Hence ſays St. Paul, "We ſeek not yours but you." and again, <q>Even as I pleaſe all men, in all things, not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NOW holineſs is the ſame throughout every part of the univerſe. The ſpirit of Chriſt's kingdom is but one. This only is the proper baſis of that union ſpoken of by Chriſt, <q>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, that they alſo may be one in us, I in them, and thou in me, that they alſo may be perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me.</q> Is not here then, my brethren, unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023135_0020_0FBC83CF49ED32E0"/>proof of the propoſition before us?—</p>
            <p n="4">IV. FARTHER evidence in ſupport of the doctrine, that diſintereſted love is eſſential to the chriſtian character, may be produced from many paſſages of ſcripture, which explicitly eſtabliſh it. To this purpoſe, you will ſuffer me to requeſt your attention to the following. Matt. v. 44. <q>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies. Bleſs them that curſe you. Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you. Luke vi. 31. "And as ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them. For if ye love them which love you, what thank have you? For ſinners alſo love thoſe that love them. And if ye lend to thoſe of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? For ſinners alſo lend to ſinners to receive as much again. But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, <hi>hoping for nothing again,</hi> and your reward ſhall be great, and ye ſhall be the children of the higheſt, for he is kind unto the unthankful, and to the evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE love here enjoined, as conſtituting the diſtinguiſhing character of Chriſt's diſciples, is certainly of a diſintereſted nature. Self-intereſt is not the ſpring of it. We are enjoined to do good without any reſpect to perſonal advantage, from a mere principle of loving to do good,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023135_0021_0FBC83D06ECD9140"/>even to thoſe whom our ſelfiſh affections natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prompt us to hate and injure. And leſt we ſhould imagine that this love was not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the chriſtian character, Chriſt repeatedly aſſures us, that if we have it not, and do not act from the influence of it, we are no better than publicans and ſinners. Correſpondent to which, are the words of Chriſt. Luke 14.26. <q>If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſiſters, yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my diſciple.</q> i.e. If a man have not that diſintereſted love to me and my kingdom, which ſhall diſpoſe him to a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary ſacrifice of his own private intereſts for my ſake, and for the ſake of the Goſpel, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the kingdom of my great enemy, and cannot be admitted to a ſhare in thoſe bleſſings, which I will beſtow on all, who truly take up their croſs, and follow me. To the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and enjoining the ſame thing, are the words of the Apoſtle. 1 Cor. 10. 24. <q>Let no man ſeek his own, but every man another's wealth.</q> In the ſame manner he ſpeaks of that charity, the nature of which he particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delineates in 1 Cor. 13 ch. and of which he ſays, <q>Though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge; and though I have all faith, ſo that I
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023135_0022_0FBC83D39FDE10D8"/>could remove mountains, and have no chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I am nothing. And though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing;</q> and, which he ſays in another place, <q>is the fulfilling of the law;</q> of this charity, he gives this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing characteriſtic, <q>ſhe ſeeketh nother own.</q> Hence he reprobates the oppoſite principle of ſinners, as repugnant to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity. "For I have no man," ſays he in his epiſtle to the Epheſians. <q>like-minded, who will naturally care for your ſtate, for all ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſt's.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ADDRESSING his ſon Timothy on the peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous times that were to come, he ſpeaks of this, as one of the greateſt evils that ſhould attend them, <q>For men ſhall be lovers of their <hi>own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> 
               </q> I need not comment on theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, becauſe they expreſsly teach the doctrine we are now ſupporting. They unequivocally aſſert, that diſintereſted love is at the foundation of the chriſtian character, or they teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they are perfectly unintelligible, and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be underſtood from the ſacred volume.</p>
            <p>BUT it is time for me to proceed to the other branch of the doctrine, and to ſhow that diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted love is binding on all mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:023135_0023_0FBC83D4FA190430"/>
AFTER what has been advanced to prove, that it is eſſential to the chriſtian character, much need not be ſaid to demonſtrate, that as the eſſence of duty, it is obligatory upon men of all deſcriptions. For ſurely, all mankind are bound to the ſame obedience, which the true chriſtian renders. If diſintereſted love was the actuating principle in the Redeemer of the world, if it was the grand impelling affection in the inſpired Apoſtles, and if it was taught to Chriſt's followers, by ſuch numerous precepts, as <hi>that</hi> charity without which they could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then its univerſal obligation is indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>BUT that it may be rendered, if poſſible, ſtill more indiſputable, ſuffer me to make ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional obſervations from the nature of things, and from the expreſs commands of GOD reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IT is obvious from the nature of things, that all mankind are bound to exerciſe this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted love, and to act in all the tranſactions of life from the governing influence of it. Can it be reaſonable that ſelf ſhould be the object of our ſupreme and ultimate regard? Can it be right that all our ſolicitude and concern ſhould center on mere perſonal intereſts? Can it be juſt for us to view our little ſelves as of ſuch mighty importance, as to entertain no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023135_0024_0FBC83D67A6762B0"/>for other beings, only as they contribute to our felicity, and are ſubſervient to our purpoſes? What are we! creatures of a day, whoſe breath is in our noſtrils, who hang upon our Makers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy; what are we, that we ſhould be the ſole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our own regard? Of what little compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative conſequence are we and our intereſts, in the ſcale of being? What mighty loſs would the Univerſe ſuſtain if we were ſtruck out of it? Is not the exiſtence and glory of GOD, of infinitely more worth and value, than any intereſts of ours? Is not the good, the happineſs of the moral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of far, yea, of inconceiveably greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence than ours? And is not the happineſs of an individual of our fellow creatures, of as much worth as our own happineſs? For a man then to love himſelf ſupremely and ſolely, is it not to make an idol of ſelf, and to raiſe himſelf in his own views and eſteem, far above the infinite Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and the hoſts of intelligent creatures? Is it not in effect to place all beings as proſtrate at his own feet? And what is this, but a wicked, baſe contempt of the infinite GOD, and other beings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the plaineſt dictates of reaſon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe!</p>
            <p>EVERY object deſerves love and regard in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its intrinſic worth and excellence. Hence the Deity has a claim to more regard than the whole Univerſe of creatures. And the good of the collective body of intelligent creatures, is of vaſtly more worth and importance than ours. And the exiſtence and happineſs of a fellow creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of as much worth and importance, have a claim to as much benevolent regard. It is this diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed benevolence, this ardent diffuſive love my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which links holy beings in heaven together, into one perfect harmonious whole. Were ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023135_0025_0FBC83D82F439C00"/>to reign among them, it would produce uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal jar, animoſity, and ruin. It is a baſe narrow ſelfiſhneſs, which is at the foundation of the wars, tumults, rivalſhips, envying, and bickering of the preſent ſinful world. Were men to conſult the good and happineſs of each other as much as they do their own, the felicity of paradiſe would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. Selfiſhneſs then, is the ſubverſion of all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, propriety and happineſs.</p>
            <p>BUT that all men are under obligations to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this diſintereſted affection to other beings, is put out of all diſpute by the particular, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory injunctions of the Deity. <q>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy GOD, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyſelf.</q> This is the ſummary of the divine law, given by the authority of GOD, and enforced by the moſt awful ſanctions. And it has been ſhown that diſintereſted love is the love here enjoined. <q>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of <hi>others.</hi> But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again. Let no man ſeek his own, but every man anothers wealth.</q> Theſe are expreſs commands of the living GOD. They enjoin the love we have been deſcribing, and <q>curſed be he whoſoever continueth not in all things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of the law to do them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I AM now to anſwer one or two objections to the foregoing doctrines.</p>
            <p>I. The paſſage of the Apoſtle in Heb. xii. 2. is ſometimes mentioned as an objection to the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of diſintereſted love, <q>Looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith, who <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him</hi> endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of GOD.</q> The objection from this paſſage
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023135_0026_0FBC83D9C4129658"/>ſuppoſeth, that the joy which was ſet before Chriſt was an intereſted object; that it was an additional joy, or felicity, to which as a perſonal acquiſition, he had ultimate reſpect. It ſuppoſeth that the great end, which Chriſt had in view was his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the advancement of his own happineſs. But is it true, that the ſon of GOD was influenced, ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately by ſelfiſh motives, in that ſcene of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſufferings, which Chriſtians are wont to contemplate with ſo much admiration? Was this the nature of that joy which was ſet before Chriſt? Was it mere perſonal enjoyment? Was it not on the other hand a <hi>benevolent joy,</hi> the joy of ſeeing, as the reſult of his ſufferings and death, his Father eminently and eternally glorified; was it not the joy of ſeeing the empire of happineſs extended, the bleſſedneſs of the univerſe augmented, and milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of precious ſouls delivered from ſin and endleſs torments, and raiſed to the enjoyment of immortal glory? Well might the benevolent heart of Chriſt rejoice in the proſpect of this inconceivable good. This I venture to ſay was the joy which was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt. This it was which made him ſo nobly endure the croſs, and deſpiſe the ſhame. It was a joy purely diſintereſted. And for any one to ſay, that it was what the objection ſuppoſeth, that Chriſt was ultimately ſelfiſh, in his ſubmiſſion to death, is to advance a poſition, which militates with all the repreſentations of the Goſpel, which obſcures the glory of the Saviour and perverts one of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt paſſages in the ſacred volume.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another objection to the doctrine of diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted love, is drawn from what is ſaid of Moſes in the xi Chap. of Hebrews 26 verſe, <q>Eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches, than the treaſures in Egypt, <hi>for he had reſpect unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the reward.</hi>
               </q> The objection raiſed

               </gap>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:023135_0027_0FBC83DC49B375A0"/>as it is delineated in the holy Bible, is of ſo uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a diſintereſted complexion, that it of itſelf fully refutes the objection without any comment.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now cloſe what has been ſaid with an IMPROVEMENT.</p>
            <p n="1">I. From what has been exhibited we infer, that thoſe are guilty of a great and very pernicious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who deny the exiſtence of diſintereſted love, and our obligations to the exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been advanced in this diſcourſe, it is obvious; that diſintereſted love is the ſubſtance of all duty, and of all moral beauty. It is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt, and ſecond commandments of the law. It is the great bond of harmony and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the heavenly world, and without it, there cannot poſſibly exiſt in the heart of man, any real conformity to that glorious example of love and goodneſs, which is ſet us in the Goſpel. Thoſe therefore who deny this, as eſſential to the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an character, and binding on every man, do in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect deny all religion, they take the part of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and convert the whole glorious ſyſtem of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel duty into a ſcheme of mere ſelfiſhneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. From our ſubject we learn, that human de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity is radically founded in ſelfiſhneſs. Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted love is the ſubſtance of that holineſs which is required of us. Of courſe ſelfiſhneſs muſt be the ſubſtance of that rebellion for which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. This is the idolatry which GOD will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with inextinguiſhable burnings. Sinners hate GOD becauſe he ſtands in the way of their ſelfiſh propenſities; becauſe he will not let the wicked go unpuniſhed. They hate his government and laws; becauſe they care for nothing but their own ſelfiſh objects, and becauſe the government and laws of GOD claſh with thoſe objects. And if we will impartially examine the principles of human
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023135_0028_0FBC83DFF6E7BD88"/>intercourſe, we ſhall find that ſelfiſhneſs is the foundation of all thoſe moral diſorders, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb ſociety. Men are envious, revengful, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jous, fraudulent, treacherous, thieviſh, debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they love their own intereſts, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures more than the reputation, peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their neighbours.</p>
            <p n="3">III. OUR ſubject affords this inference, that all external performances of a religious aſpect, which reſult from motives of ſelfiſhneſs, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute no real obedience, and do not enter inot the nature of that holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee GOD. If on the ſuppoſition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of that charity which ſeeketh not her own, St. Paul could ſay, though I ſpeak with the tongue of men and angels, I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and my body to be burned, it profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me nothing; then certainly, whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal performances reſult not from this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple within, are mere droſs, and no proper or acceptable compliance with the divine law what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>IF a man ſhould ſerve his country with ever ſo much external diligence and activity, though his ſervice in itſelf might eſſentially contribute to the public good; yet, if it all were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of ſelfiſhneſs and dictated by motives of ſelf-intereſt, not by a ſuperiour regard to the divine glory and the good of men, it would be nothing in the divine account. Were a man to contribute ever ſo largely to the relief of the diſtreſſed, yet if it be done through an ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate regard to his own private ends, and not from diſintereſted motives, it would be nothing. Hence ſays Chriſt, <q>When thou doeſt thine alms, do not found a trumpet before thee, as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023135_0029_0FBC83E181A0BF80"/>the hypocrites do in the ſynagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, that they may have glory of men Verily I ſay unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doſt alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</q> If men externally faſt and pray ever ſo conſtantly, yet if ſelf is the ſpring of their apparent duty, it enters not into the nature of obedience. Therefore ſays the apoſtle James, <q>Ye aſk and ye receive not, becauſe ye aſk amiſs, that ye may conſume it upon your luſts.</q> Hence the precept, <q>Whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. OUR ſubject teaches us, that the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years reign of Chriſt on earth, in the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent enlargement and glory of the Church, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by ſcripture prophecy, will be attended with unſpeakable glory and happineſs. Inſpired truth predicts, that the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, even as the waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſea; that the time ſhall come, when Satan ſhall be bound for a thouſand years, and not be ſuffered to deceive the nations any more till thoſe thouſand years ſhall be fulfilled; when the kingdoms of this world, ſhall become the kingdom of our Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; when many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when all ſhall know GOD, from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unto the leaſt; and the nations of the world ſhall beat their ſwords into plough-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks, and ſhall learn war no more. Such a bleſſed period has not yet gladened this ſinful diſtracted world. It is therefore yet to come. It is advancing as faſt as the wheels of time roll round, and probably it is not far diſtant. What glory my brethern will diſtinguiſh this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023135_0030_0FBC83E3EC9B8288"/>ſcene! Here will be the reign of holineſs, and holineſs is love. Diſintereſted love will here erect her throne, and extend her benign and ſalutary way. The ſelfish propenſities will give way to the milder and more peaceful influence of imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affection. Hence frauds, treacheries and rapine will ceaſe, and mankind will live together as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, anticipating in the grateful fervour of their love to GOD and one another, the undiſturbed feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of that world, where love will be perfect and interminable.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Let me cloſe, by calling upon you all, my chriſtian brethern and fellow ſinners, in the name of that GOD who is love, to exerciſe and uniformly to act from the influence of that love which is the fulfilling of the law. If ye live deſtitute of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection, as the ſupreme and governing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of your ſouls, ye will be cumberers of the ground, ye will live under the curſe of your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and at laſt lie down in ſorrow. If that charity which ſeeketh not her own have the aſcendency in your hearts, and transfuſe itſelf in your lives, ye will reſemble the divine Philanthropiſt, who died for us. You will live uſefully and happily; you will leave the world in triumph, and heaven will be your reſidence forever. Now to GOD only wiſe and our Saviour, be glory and dominion Amen.</p>
