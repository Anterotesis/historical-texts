            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>PSALM CXIX. 59, 60.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>I THOUGHT on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies:</p>
                  <p>I MADE haſte, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT being of no great conſequence to us to know,<note place="margin">SERM I.</note> I ſhall not now ſpend time to inquire, whether the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt here refers to his thinking on his ways after falling into ſome particular great ſin, or ſins, as good men are liable to fall; and his ſpeedily turning his feet again unto God's teſtimonies, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008667_0007_102fad526d4249d8"/>
of ſuch reflection: Or whether he refers to ſome period, poſſibly in his early youth, when he was not yet a true fearer and ſervant of God; but being brought to a ſerious conſideration of his ways, and the fatal tendency of them, he then, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, altered the general courſe of his life; turning from his former wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the way of righteouſneſs; and ſo, of a child of diſobedience and wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a ſon of God, and an heir of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I ſay, I do not conceive it to be of much importance to us to inquire into this matter: For there is evidently a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold repentance, or turning to God, and to the keeping of his teſtimonies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; to both of which, ſober re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, or thinking on our ways, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and conducive; and both of which may, I ſuppoſe, properly come under conſideration, in a diſcourſe upon the preſent ſubject. The firſt is that of wicked, unrighteous men; of thoſe who have lived unmindful of God, and of their duty to him; thoſe who have habitually violated his commandments in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part of their lives; till, by ſome means or other, being put upon ſerious thought and reflection, they are induced to forſake their ſins, and to enter upon a new courſe of life, a life of piety, virtue
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008667_0008_102fad54669c4700"/>
and religion. And this is what, in the language of ſcripture, is more generally intended by repentance, or turning to God and his commandments. But there is a ſecondary repentance and reformation, or turning to God's teſtimonïes, which is proper to good and holy men, who have in general kept the commandments. For even the righteous may, in times of great temptation, or at any time, if they are not circumſpect and watchful, fall into conſiderable ſins, and come very ſhort of their duty in many reſpects. And ſuch men are generally, if not always, by the good providence and grace of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to think on their ways, and amend them; to
<q>remember from whence they are fallen, to repent, and to do the firſt works.</q>
This, you perceive, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or turning to God's teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, different in ſome reſpects from that before-mentioned, the ſubjects of it being ſo different. It is indeed common to the ſubjects of both, to have broken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and to have gone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his teſtimonies; this being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in turning their feet unto them. But then the ſubjects of the former repentance and reformation, are cuſtomary, habitual ſinners, whoſe whole courſe and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life is hereby changed; whereas
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008667_0009_102fad55ece8c3e0"/>
the ſubjects of the latter, are righteous, good men, who having in ſome reſpects violated their duty, return to it, and keep the commandments of God more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly. It is but once that a man exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes repentance towards God in the firſt ſenſe, as it ſignifies the breaking off a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and entering upon a new, an holy, and divine, life: But repentance, or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, in the latter ſenſe, may, and ought to be, and is, often repeated in this imperfect ſtate; even as often as a good man deviates from the path of his duty, and returns to it with an humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart.</p>
            <p>Now, what the particular caſe of the Pſalmiſt was, to which he refers in the paſſage I have choſen for the ſubject of ſeveral diſcourſes; whether he refers to the time of his firſt converſion to God, from the ways of ſin and folly, or to that of his recovery from ſome criminal lapſe after he had known the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; every one is left to his own opinion, as a thing that is very immaterial in itſelf, or at leaſt to my preſent deſign. Neither do I think it of any great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance now to inquire, what was the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and more immediate occaſion of the Pſalmiſt's being thus led to think on his ways, and to walk in God's teſtimonies;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008667_0010_102fad5d5d023178"/>
whether it were ſickneſs, or ſome other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening viſitation of divine providence; whether it were affliction and adverſity of any kind, or that abounding goodneſs and mercy of God, the deſign of which is to lead men to repentance; or laſtly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there might not poſſibly be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of ſeveral means, to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of which, under the influence and bleſſing of God who worketh all in all, this happy effect was to be aſcribed.</p>
            <p>THE judgments of God are unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and none can find out either the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, or his ways, unto perfection. But we know in general, that there is a great variety of means which God makes uſe of, to bring about the deſigns of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and grace; and which, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, he uſes for the awakening and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſinners; to reclaim them from the ways of folly and deſtruction, to the wiſdom of the juſt, and cauſe them to walk in his teſtimonies. Tho' God is omnipotent, yet he ſeldom or never works wholly without means. He did not even produce the world by a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, or act of his own power; but he "created all things by Jeſus Chriſt."<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 3.9 comp. Col 1.16. Joh. 1.3. &amp; Heb 1.2. &amp; 10.</note> And as God originally created, ſo he ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the world by his Son; and by the means and inſtrumentality of other beings,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008667_0011_102fad5ee8e4fe80"/>
and ſecondary cauſes. And amongſt thoſe which he employs for the convincing and reclaiming of ſinners, and bringing many ſons unto glory, ſome are ſtated and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, others extraordinary and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. It is chiefly the former, viz. the natural and ſtated means, and very ſeldom the latter, or miraculous ones, at leaſt in this age of the world, that God uſes to this end. Saul, afterwards Paul the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and ſome few others of old, ſeem indeed to have been preternaturally ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in their wicked courſes, and converted to God; that perſecutor of the ſaints ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been at once ſtruck blind, and ſtruck to the earth, in his journey to Damaſcus, while he heard a voice from heaven, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him,
<q>Saul, Saul, why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou me?</q>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 9.3, &amp;c.</note> There may poſſibly have been ſome examples, even in theſe laſt ages, of a ſudden and extraordinary converſion, not very diſſimilar to this. However, ſuch things have neither been common and frequent in any age, even the age of miracles, nor are they to be expected in this. God has favoured us with a plain, ſtanding revelation of his will, long ſince ſufficiently confirmed and eſtabliſhed
<q>by ſigns, and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
Herein both his mercy and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008667_0012_102fad6072613f50"/>
his wrath are clearly revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the former, to thoſe who think of their ways, and turn their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unto his teſtimonies; the latter,
<q>againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</q>
And to this revelation God juſtly expects, that we ſhould diligently attend; receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth in the love of it, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our lives and actions by the rules of it. For this grace of God which has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us, teaches us that,
<q>denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the preſent world.</q>
And this we are indiſpenſably bound to do, even tho' nothing very ſignal or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſhould occur in the courſe of God's providence, whether in the way of judgment or of mercy, to put us upon thinking on our ways, and turning to him. However, there are often ſuch diſpenſations of providence as theſe; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated in the nature and deſign of them, to rouze and awaken the minds of men to that ſerious and religious ſenſe of things, which becomes them. And theſe events of providence, tho' perhaps diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by many, will yet, by the bleſſing of God, have their deſigned good effect upon others; cauſing them to think on their ways, to make haſte, and not delay
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008667_0013_102fad63afe21e20"/>
to keep his commandments. To this it is to be added, that God is almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſtriving with us by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which co-operates with his word and providences to awaken ſinners, and lead them to repentance: Tho', alas! there are many beſides the Iſraelites, who
<q>do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt;</q>
and grieve and quench the bleſſed Spirit of God, till they are given over of him to a reprobate mind; and left to treaſure up unto themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of his righteous judgment; who will finally
<q>render to every man according to his deeds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to return: Whatever might be the particular caſe of the Pſalmiſt, to which he refers in the text; and whatever were the diſpenſations of God's providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him at that time; ſtill we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of theſe three things; That he
<q>tho't on his ways;</q>
That, in conſequence hereof, he
<q>turned his feet unto God's teſtimonies;</q>
and, That he did this ſpeedily; or, in his own more emphatical language, That he
<q>made haſte, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd not to keep his commandments.</q>
And as every one underſtands well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in general, what is intended by turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keeping his commandments, I ſhall
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008667_0014_102fad6a6c6d2f28"/>
not needleſly ſpend time in explaining it: But</p>
            <p>MY deſign is, in the firſt place, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you the great, yea, infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance hereof, by ſeveral conſiderations.</p>
            <p>I SHALL then ſhow, by a variety of arguments, the vaſt importance of being ſpeedy in this buſineſs; and the extreme folly and danger of delaying it.</p>
            <p>THE reaſonableneſs of thinking on our ways, together with the neceſſity and conduciveneſs hereof to a reformation of them, will be ſhown in the third place. And</p>
            <p>LASTLY, I ſhall make ſome applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſubject, in a ſerious, recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory addreſs to you: Nor ſhall I omit to take a particular notice therein of the late alarming viſitations of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which are ſo peculiarly adapted to awaken us all to conſider our ways, and to amend them; and which have, accordingly, led my thoughts to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject. And I ſhall endeavour, by divine aſſiſtance, to handle the ſubject in ſuch a manner as to render it, in ſome meaſure, profitable both to wicked men and good; to thoſe who have hitherto lived in the habitual violation of God's commandments, ſo as to need a total change of heart and manners; and to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008667_0015_102fad6c099ab5b0"/>
thoſe who, although they may have long been the true ſervants of the Moſt High, yet need to be awakened to greater watchfulneſs and circumſpection, and more diligence in working the work of God.</p>
            <p>FIRST, I am to repreſent to you the great, yea, infinite importance which it is to ſinners, to turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies, and to keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For this is ſo far from being a matter of indifference, of little or no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to us, that there is hardly any thing elſe which claims our care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; to be ſure, nothing in compariſon of it. Now the vaſt importance hereof is apparent from many conſiderations; and more particularly from the four following ones, which I ſhall enlarge upon in this, and in the next enſuing diſcourſe. It appears</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> FROM a general conſideration of God's power and greatneſs, his holineſs and univerſal dominion, and our abſolute dependence upon him.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly.</hi> FROM the clear and poſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of his wrath, in his word, againſt all impenitent, irreclaimable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly.</hi> FROM the great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the goſpel made to thoſe who
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008667_0016_102fad6d9c67ba80"/>
turn at God's reproof, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">thly.</hi> FROM a conſideration of that aſtoniſhing method which God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for our ſalvation from the dominion of ſin, and the puniſhment due to it.</p>
            <p>THESE things which I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being ſeriouſly and properly attended to, no one can doubt but that it is of infinite importance to thoſe who have tranſgreſſed the laws of God, to turn their feet unto his teſtimonies, and to walk in his commandments. And I muſt juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you, that this is what all of us have done, in a greater or leſs degree; it being certain, that both jews and gentiles are "all under ſin;" and the whole world become "guilty before God:" Which could not be, except all had tranſgreſſed his laws; for
<q>ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the law.</q>
We are therefore all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the preſent ſubject, either more or leſs; and ſhould impartially apply it to ourſelves, according to truth and equity.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> The importance of turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, appears from a general conſideration of his power and greatneſs, his holineſs and univerſal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and our abſolute dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. When we reflect upon theſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008667_0017_102fad70d76810c0"/>
things, it is at firſt view very evident, how greatly it concerns us to ſecure to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the good-will and patronage of our Maker, by obeying his commandments; and what a terrible hazard we run, by perſiſting in our rebellion againſt him, and in oppoſition to his righteous government. It is certainly wiſe in men, and muſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally turn to their unſpeakable advantage to pleaſe that being, who is infinite in wiſdom; to ſubmit to his authority, whoſe kingdom ruleth over all; to reſemble, in their own tempers and manners, him who is perfectly holy, juſt and good; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the friendſhip and protection of him, who is all-powerful; and in fine, to adore, to love and obey him, in whom all theſe adoreable qualities and perfections are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited. And if it is wiſe and prudent for men to do thus; then it certainly becomes them, whenever they have done otherwiſe in any degree, and neglected their duty and trueſt intereſt, to be heartily ſorry for it; and to amend their ways. Now thus wiſe for themſelves, are all they, who, with the Pſalmiſt, think of their ways, and return to God, from whom they have gone aſtray. And if this is the moſt wiſe and prudent courſe for ſinners to take; if, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, they beſt conſult both their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future intereſt; how fooliſh and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008667_0018_102fad770ac3b108"/>
mad, on the contrary, is the conduct of thoſe, and how certainly are they deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, who continue in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to infinite wiſdom; and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the great lord and ſovereign of the univerſe? they who, by perſevering in their wicked ways, continue to be as unlike as they can to the moſt perfect and amiable of beings? they who provoke that infinite power, which can either deprive them of exiſtence in a moment, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them in it forever, to puniſh their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and temerity? they who daily abuſe, affront and blaſpheme that moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doreable being, in whoſe hand their breath is, and whoſe are all their ways? How fooliſh, imprudent, and even mad, I ſay, are ſuch perſons? and how ſurely do they "ſeek death in the error of their life?" And yet thus do all they, who having departed from God's teſtimonies, will not turn their feet to them again; but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in violating his holy commandments; of whom, alas! there are ſo many thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world; and even in that part of it which is called chriſtian.</p>
            <p>THIS conduct of ſinners muſt, one wou'd think, proceed from great ignorance of God and themſelves; for if that light of divine truth which ſhines around them, did actually ſhine into their hearts, ſo as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008667_0019_102fad78d36a69c8"/>
to give them the knowledge of the glory and majeſty of God, it would be morally impoſſible for them to act ſuch a part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. No man who has a juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the greatneſs and glory of that being, who created all things, and upholds them all by the word of his power; who is both the righteous lawgiver, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judge of the world, equally able to ſave and to deſtroy; no man who has a juſt conception of almighty God, I ſay, and who thinks ſoberly of himſelf as he ought to think, being duly ſenſible of his own weakneſs, littleneſs and dependent condition, can help ſeeing the infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance which it is to him to forſake his ſinful courſes, and to work righteouſneſs: No one can help ſeeing, that upon doing ſo, his whole intereſt and being depend. It were certainly better for us never to have been born, or even now to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to nothing, by the breath which gave us being, than, by continuing to rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt high God, to remain under his diſpleaſure; not only excluded from a ſhare in his loving-kindneſs, which is better than life; but alſo the objects of his wrath, which is worſe than death. Who can, on one hand, fully expreſs the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of thoſe who love and ſerve God, and are beloved of him? Who, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008667_0020_102fad7ab6afe890"/>
hand, knoweth the power of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and the miſery of thoſe who continue liable to the terrible effects and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it? Reflect a little upon the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing effects of God's power, viſible in the material world;
<q>look unto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and ſee, and behold the clouds which are higher than thou;</q>
contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the great works of God in the earth beneath, the ſea, and upon the dry land: And when you have, by conſidering theſe works of God, attained to a juſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his greatneſs and majeſty, then doubt, if you can, whether it be a thing of the laſt importance to you to be at peace with him; to have him for your friend and protector? whether his favour is not more to be deſired than life? and whether, to be the object of his wrath, is not worſe than death? And if this is a thing of any conſequence to you, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſo, whether you do, or do not turn to God, and keep his commandments: For upon this it depends, whether God, the ſovereign ruler and potentate, who doeth his will in the armies of heaven, and amongſt the inhabitants of the earth, ſhall be your friend or your enemy. We may be certain from the mere light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that impious and unrighteous men muſt be the objects of God's diſpleaſure;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008667_0021_102fad7c470fc128"/>
and that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of him that liveth forever, as the victims of his anger: For how ſhould a man's heart endure, or his hands be ſtrong, when God deals with him in righteous ſeverity; and gives him the due reward of his deeds! But</p>
            <p>THIS brings me to the ſecond thing mentioned, in order to ſhow the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keeping his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; viz.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly.</hi> THE clear and poſitive denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his wrath, in his word, againſt all impenitent, irreclaimable tranſgreſſors. Thô it is at leaſt probable from the light of nature, that we ſhall exiſt in a future ſtate; and althô it is a dictate of reaſon and natural conſcience, that if we actually exiſt thus hereafter, vicious, ungodly men ſhall undergo ſome ſtrange puniſhment, as inflicted by the righteous Lord and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the univerſe; yet men in general being ſlow at reaſoning, and ſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to this world, that they will ſcarce give themſelves time to think ſeriouſly of another, or to conſider what muſt in all probability be the conſequence, as it is the juſt demerit, of a wicked life; God has therefore ſent his prophets and apoſtles, and even his own Son, to admoniſh and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008667_0022_102fad816d7ff6e8"/>
warn us; to call us to repentance, and to denounce his wrath and righteous ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt bold, preſumptuous ſinners. By them his wrath is now moſt clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men; and it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced equally, both againſt them that "hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs," and them that do not hold the truth at all, but hate and reject it,
<q>leſt their deeds which are evil ſhould be reproved.</q>
And this wrath of God is revealed in ſuch terms as no ſinner that hears them, can either eaſily miſtake the ſenſe of, or avoid trembling at; unleſs he is more hardened and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned than even Felix was, when St. Paul
<q>reaſoned of righteouſneſs, temperance and judgment to come.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE no fondneſs for uſing harſh, and very terrifying language in preaching; and could heartily wiſh there was never any occaſion for it. But it is manifeſt from the holy ſcriptures, and indeed from our own experience and obſervation, that ſome ſinners are ſo in love with their luſts and vices, as to need ſuch language in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their being reclaimed from them. Yea, experience ſhows, that even all the terrible menaces in God's word are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to produce a reformation in ſome hardened, and bold tranſgreſſors; yea, I
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008667_0023_102fad85c587d138"/>
may add, they are ſo far from working any thorô and laſting amendment in them, that they hardly awaken them to any degree of ſerious tho'tfulneſs concerning their latter end. This being the caſe, I imagine there is not only no impropriety, but an evident expediency, and even neceſſity, in a diſcourſe upon this ſubject, of plainly laying before men the threatnings of God in his word, againſt thoſe who perſevere in their wicked courſes; which, by his bleſſing, may prove ſalvation to their ſouls: But whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, the miniſters of religion are required, in order to the delivering their own ſouls, and being clear from the blood of all men, to give them warning as from God: that ſo their guilt may be all their own, and their deſtruction of themſelves, if they perſiſt in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deeds. What God ſays to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ezekiel, <note n="c" place="margin">Chap. 3. ver. 17, 18, 19.</note> is applicable in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to every man, who is by office a preacher of righteouſneſs:
<q>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I ſay unto the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die; and thou giveſt him not warning; nor ſpeakeſt to warn the wicked from his wicked way to ſave
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008667_0024_102fad8799a86ba0"/>
his life, the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way, he ſhall die in his iniquity; but thou haſt delivered thy ſoul.</q>
You muſt therefore ſuffer me plainly to repreſent to you the threatnings, which God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſuch as diſregard his teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies, and violate his commandments. This I ſhall do in the very language of ſcripture: for I do not think it proper to indulge to my own imagination, or even to uſe my own words, upon ſo ſolemn and tremendous a ſubject.</p>
            <p>IN the ſcriptures of the old teſtament we find ſuch declarations and threatnings as theſe. In the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of the book of Deuteronomy, after a curſe has been particularly denounced againſt ſeveral ſorts of ſinners, there is a general one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt all the tranſgreſſors of the law in common, in the following terms:
<q>Curſed <note n="d" place="bottom">The apoſtle Paul gives us the ſenſe of this malediction, Gal. 3.10. in the following words, — <q>It is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</q>
                  </note> is he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them: and all the people ſhall ſay, Amen.</q>
It is ſaid Pſalm 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> That
<q>the Lord is in his holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Lord's throne is in heaven; his
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008667_0025_102fad89233b5150"/>
eyes behold, his eylids try the children of men. The Lord trieth the righteous; but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his ſoul hateth. Upon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt: this ſhall be the portion of their cup.</q>
It is ſaid in the book of Job, chap. 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, That
<q>the triumphing of the wicked is ſhort, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; yet he ſhall periſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, like his own dung</q>
—
<q>God ſhall caſt the fury of his wrath upon him, and ſhall rain it upon him</q>
—
<q>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall reveal his iniquity, and the earth ſhall riſe up againſt him</q>
—
<q>This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.</q>
It is ſaid in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of the prophecy of Daniel, That
<q>many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame, and everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</q>
It is ſaid in the prophecy of Malachi,
<q>Then ſhall ye return, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between the righteous and the wicked; between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the day cometh that ſhall burn as
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008667_0026_102fad91cbfd9868"/>
an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be ſtubble; and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</q>
And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wicked men are apt to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the hopes of impunity, even while they hear the curſe of God denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt them, therefore it is ſaid, Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chap.—
<q>Leſt there be among you a root that beareth gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; and it come to paſs, when he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, thô I walk in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine heart, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt: the Lord will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſy ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this book ſhall lie upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and the Lord ſhall ſeparate him unto evil.</q>
Agreeably hereto, it is ſaid in the perſon of wiſdom, Proverbs chap. 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>.
<q>How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity? and the ſcorners delight in ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my repoof</q>
—
<q>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed; I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008667_0027_102fad935683afe8"/>
but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: I alſo will laugh at your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, I will mock when your fear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; when your fear cometh as deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you. Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me; for that they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord.</q>
Now when wiſdom crieth thus without, and utters her voice in this manner, by way of warning to ſinners, it is, I ſuppoſe, the ſame thing in effect as if God himſelf had ſpoken to them in the like language; which is, indeed, very ſolemn and terrifying.</p>
            <p>BUT let us, from the old, proceed to the ſcriptures of the new teſtament, and ſee what is ſaid therein to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; I mean, by way of threatning againſt the impenitent tranſgreſſors of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and teſtimonies. Our bleſſed Saviour in his explanation of the parable of the tares, Matthew 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, ſays,—
<q>The harveſt is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered, and burnt in the fire; ſo ſhall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008667_0028_102fad952d200080"/>
and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire: there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</q>
In the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of the ſame goſpel of St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, where the proceedings of the laſt day are more largely and particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us than any where elſe, our Lord has declared, that when he is ſeated upon the throne of his glory, and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are gathered before him, he will ſay to the wicked on his left hand,
<q>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</q>
and that, in conſequence of this moſt awful but righteous ſentence,
<q>theſe ſhall go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into everlaſting puniſhment.</q>
It is ſaid in the Acts of the Apoſtles, chap. 17. That God
<q>now commandeth all men every where to repent; becauſe he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs, by that man whom he hath ordained.</q>
And Romans 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. it is ſaid, that God
<q>will render to every man according to his deeds:</q>
—
<q>unto them that are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath; tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doeth evil, of the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008667_0029_102fad9a4c7f0d08"/>
Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile</q>
—
<q>For there is no reſpect of perſons with God.</q>
It is declared in the ſecond epiſtle to the Theſſalonians, chap. 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, That
<q>the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</q>
And in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter of the revelation of St. John, it is ſaid of the wicked, that
<q>the ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, into the cup of his indignation; and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone, in the preſence of the holy angels, and in the preſence of the lamb: and the ſmoke of their torment aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth up for ever and ever; and they have no reſt day nor night.</q>
—Such are the expreſs, poſitive declarations found in the new teſtament reſpecting the future perdition of ungodly men; of all ſuch as will not think of their ways in time, and turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>AND it will be proper to remind you here, that leſt the profeſſors of chriſtianity ſhould flatter themſelves that theſe and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008667_0030_102fad9d6059d088"/>
ſuch-like threatnings in the word of God, are denounced only againſt the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heathen world; againſt thoſe who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never heard of the Goſpel, or having heard of it, openly and profeſſedly reject it; our Lord has admoniſhed us, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long equally to wicked believers, with unbelievers, even thò they make high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to religion, and of love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him,
<q>eating and drinking in his preſence.</q>
For he has aſſured us, that he will hereafter ſay to all ſuch hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal profeſſors of his name and religion,
<q>Depart from me, I know you not whence you are, all ye workers of iniquity.</q>
Yea farther, it is to be obſerved, that thô the goſpel is ſo emphatically a diſpenſation of grace and mercy to ſinners, yet it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared therein, that they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their ſins and diſobedience, while they know the truth, and their duty, ſhall receive a far heavier doom hereafter, than either wicked pagans, or wicked men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the legal diſpenſation. There is a paſſage full to the firſt of theſe points in the goſpel of St. Matthew: <note n="e" place="margin">Chap. XI. ver. 20.</note>
               <q>Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan he to upbraid the cities wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, becauſe they repented not. Wo unto thee, Chorazin, wo unto thee, Bethſaida; for if the mighty works which were
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008667_0031_102fada06494bf00"/>
done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes. But I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than for you. And thou, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, which art exalted unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day. But it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, than for you.</q>
The words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour elſewhere, are much to the ſame purpoſe; only of more general and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal extent:
<q>And that ſervant which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes: For unto whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much is given, of him ſhall be much required: and to whom men have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted much, of him they will aſk the more.</q>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Luke XII.47, 48.</note> And theſe words of our Saviour ſuggeſt to us one, thò not the only, ground and reaſon, why wicked and incorrigible men, living under the goſpel diſpenſation, ſhall incur a ſorer puniſhment hereafter,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008667_0032_102fada2648faa38"/>
than ſuch men under the law of Moſes; the former being a clearer and more perfect diſcovery and revelation of God's will, than the latter, as it was made by a far more glorious perſonage, the Son of God in our nature. And to this purpoſe are the following paſſages of ſcripture:
<q>If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more ſacrifice for ſins; but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation to devour the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. He that deſpiſed Moſes law, died without mercy, under two or three witneſſes: Of how much ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God?—For ye know him that hath ſaid, Vengeance belongeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I will recompence, ſaith the Lord.<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. X.26.—</note>
               </q>
And again:
<q>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: For if they eſcaped not, who refuſed him that ſpake on earth,</q>
[viz. Moſes]
<q>much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven <note n="h" place="margin">Chap. 12 ver. 25.</note>
               </q>:
i. e. Jeſus Chriſt. For it is by his Son that, in theſe laſt days, God ſpeaks to the World <note n="i" place="margin">Vid. Ch. I.1, 2.</note>. There is a paſſage much to this ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, nearer the beginning of the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle; and which might therefore have
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008667_0033_102fada3ed994378"/>
been mentioned before:
<q>If the word ſpoken by angels</q>
[it being probable that angels miniſtred at the promulgation of the law at Sinai]
<q>was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a juſt recompence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord; and was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us by them that heard him; God alſo bearing them witneſs,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY they who duly conſider theſe, and ſuch-like paſſages of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot encourage and harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the tranſgreſſion of, or in diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, the commandments of Chriſt, by reflecting upon the grace revealed in the goſpel; or from an imagination that any faith in Chriſt, or dependence upon his righteouſneſs, which is conſiſtent with habitual ſinning againſt him, will ſkreen them from his juſt indignation, when the great day of his wrath ſhall come. In that day none will be able to ſtand, excepting thoſe who, having believed in God thrô him, have turned their feet unto his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and been
<q>careful to maintain good works.</q>
Without this, our faith will not profit us in the day of wrath, any more than our riches: yea, it will ſerve to aggravate our guilt and miſery, far beyond that of vicious Jews and Pagans.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:008667_0034_102fada9022fefc0"/>I HAVE now done with the two former of the particulars mentioned under this firſt general head of diſcourſe; which was, to repreſent to you the infinite importance of turning your feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keeping his commandments. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, you ſee, in ſome meaſure, only from a general conſideration of his greatneſs and majeſty, his power, juſtice, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal dominion. But the importance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appears ſtill more clearly and evidently, from a conſideration of the awful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in his word, ſo plainly denounced againſt all the impenitent workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>REFERRING the two other heads of argument mentioned above to my next diſcourſe, I ſhall conclude the preſent by beſeeching all who hear me, ſeriouſly and impartially to weigh what has now been offered to their conſideration; and then to act according to the dictates of their own reaſon and conſciences, and in ſuch a manner as they are perſwaded will, in the end, conduce moſt to their own good. And if people would but do thus, I am morally certain that not one ſoul would be loſt, or finally periſh. For no man, ſurely, would then perſiſt in his rebellion againſt God, and the known, wilful violation of his holy and juſt commandments. Every
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008667_0035_102fadae09130368"/>
man who thinks calmly, muſt know that he cannot poſſibly find his account in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the will of the all-wiſe and powerful, juſt and good governor of the world, upon whoſe pleaſure he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely depends for happineſs, for life, breath and all things, both now and forever. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſinner muſt be ſenſible, that it is of infinite importance to him to eſcape the deſerved wrath, and to obtain the favour, of this thrice glorious Being; which can be done only by amending his ways, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to him in the exerciſe of unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed repentance, and by a new life. This, every man that thinks muſt be ſenſible, is a matter of the laſt concernment to him, even thô the holy ſcriptures had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſingle word, expreſly, concerning the future puniſhment, and final perdition of ungodly men. But with how much greater clearneſs, and ſtrength of evidence does this appear, when we reflect upon thoſe poſitive, repeated, and moſt ſolemn declarations of God's word, reſpecting this point, ſome of which have been produced above?—Such threatnings as no one can hear, believing them really to come from God, the great Creator and righteous Lord of all, without being ſeized with inward horror and trembling; unleſs he is either quite abandoned, and given over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate

mind, or elſe is one of thoſe good men, in whom love, being made perfect, has "caſt out fear," and inſpired him with a holy confidence in his Maker's friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, thrô the great Redeemer of the world. For it is only when we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by grace thrô the redemption that is in Chriſt, that we are at peace with God; and only when we know this to be our happy condition, by the witneſs and fruits of the Holy Spirit, one of the principal of which is love, that we can reaſonably "aſſure our hearts before him."</p>

               <note place="margin">SERM II.</note>THE firſt thing propoſed in handling this ſubject, was, To repreſent to you the great, yea, infinite importance which it is to ſinners, to turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies, and to keep his commandments.

            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> From a general conſideration of God's power and greatneſs, his holineſs and univerſal dominion, and our abſolute dependence upon him. And</p>

               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:008667_0038_102fadb8f7005e38"/>Two other heads of argument to ſhow the importance hereof, were mentioned, but not inſiſted on, in the foregoing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Theſe are, by God's leave and aſſiſtance, to be dilated upon at this time. To proceed with the ſubject, therefore, the vaſt importance of this appears,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> FROM the great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the goſpel, made to thoſe who turn at God's repoof, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
            <p>IN eſtimating the importance of doing any particular thing to us, it is proper we ſhould, on one hand, conſider what evil and miſchief will attend the neglect, and, on the other, what good will reſult from the performance of it. And, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, irreparable damage will accrue to us from neglecting to turn our feet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's teſtimonies, or perſevering in our rebellion againſt him, has accordingly been ſhown already, from the clear and awful threatnings of his word, which will moſt certainly be verified in the utter deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked. And, what great and unſpeakable good will reſult to us by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking our ſins, and keeping God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is now to be ſhown from his moſt gracious promiſes. It is, indeed, a dictate of natural reaſon, independent of revelation, I will not ſay, that penitent
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008667_0039_102fadba845b8e08"/>
and reformed tranſgreſſors ſhall receive a full rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The light of nature, it muſt be confeſſed, leaves us very much in the dark as to another ſtate; and how it ſhall fare with thoſe, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been vicious, are reclaimed to the path of virtue before they leave the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And altho it may be probable, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the footing of mere nature and reaſon, that God will not be
<q>ſtrict to mark ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</q>
againſt ſuch perſons; but that they ſhall be in ſome degree happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, yet this is put beyond all reaſonable ground of doubt, only by the expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and promiſes of God in his word, or by immediate revelation from him. The holy ſcriptures contai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the moſt ample aſſurances of his grace and good-will, and of his kind intentions to penitent ſinners; clearly ſhowing us what great and unſpeakable gainers we ſhall be, if after we have fooliſhly departed from the living God, we turn our feet unto his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and walk in his commandments.</p>
            <p>THE benefits and bleſſed privileges which God, in his unutterable love, has
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008667_0040_102fadbc5f046a18"/>
been pleaſed to promiſe to thoſe who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely repent of their ſins, and return to him, are chiefly theſe: The free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire remiſſion of their ſins: The ſpecial care, guardianſhip and guidance of his providence in this world; and eternal life and glory in the kingdom of heaven. Theſe are the advantages which we ſhall obtain, by turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keeping his commandments; that we ſhall obtain, I mean, thrô the riches of his grace in Jeſus Chriſt, the great Mediator betwixt God and ſinful men, not indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of him. For it is only thrô him, and for his ſake, that God diſpences par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and eternal happineſs to ſinners. The wages, and proper demerit of ſin is death; but the forgiveneſs of ſins, and eternal life is the free
<q>gift of God thrô Jeſus Chriſt our Lord<note n="a" place="margin">Romans VI.23.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LET me refreſh your memory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you to your duty, by pointing out to you more particularly, ſome of theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, of which I am ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Now the holy ſcriptures abound with offers of pardon, or the forgiveneſs of ſins, to thoſe who ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well. God has all along, even ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoon after the apoſtacy of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and under the legal diſpenſation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelf propitious to ſinful men.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008667_0041_102fadbde84a4cf0"/>
The ſame mount Sinai, from which his holy law had been proclaimed in ſuch majeſty and terror, ſaw him ſoon after paſſing by, and proclaiming his name,
<q>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity and tranſgreſſion and ſin.<note n="b" place="margin">Exodus XXXIV.5, 6, 7.</note>
               </q>
—His word aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us that he is more ready to pardon ſinners who repent, and return to him with their whole heart, than they are to aſk forgiveneſs of him, or than he is to puniſh thoſe who have long deſerved his diſpleaſure. And hence it is, that he ſo compaſſionately invites and perſuades us to return to him; for he gains nothing by our doing ſo, except it be an opportunity to ſhow the exceeding riches of his grace to thoſe, whom the ſword of his juſtice might have cut off, and utterly deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>LET me particularly remind you of a few of theſe his merciful offers of pardon to thoſe who repent, and turn their feet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his teſtimonies. Thus in the prophecy of Ezekiel, chap. XVIII.—
<q>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die. All his tranſgreſſions that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008667_0042_102fadc2c6dabed8"/>
they ſhall not be mentioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: in his righteouſneſs that he hath done, he ſhall live. Have I any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at all that the wicked ſhould die? ſaith the Lord God: and not that he ſhould return from his ways and live?</q>
And afterwards in the ſame chapter,
<q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he conſidereth, and turneth away from all his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die—Repent, and turn yourſelves from all your tranſgreſſions; ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruin. Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions, whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit; for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael? For I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God: wherefore turn yourſelves, and live ye!</q>
And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe whoſe tranſgreſſions have been multiplied, of a very heinous, aggravated nature, and long continued in, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apt to deſpond, thinking that God's mercy cannot be extended to them; he has taken particular care to aſſure us, that the greatneſs of our crimes, and of our guilt, ſhall be no bar to our finding a gracious reception with him, provided we heartily turn from our ſins, and work righteouſneſs. Thus, particularly in the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008667_0043_102fadc726d33d50"/>
firſt chapter of Iſaiah, having ſet forth the ſins of his people Iſrael in the ſtrongeſt language, by comparing them to the people of Sodom; and admoniſhed them to put away the evil of their doings from before his eyes, he then encourages them to do ſo, by giving them the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of his mercy—
<q>Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord; tho' your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; thô they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NOR is this pardoning mercy of God limited to any particular penitent tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, to the excluſion of others who are alike penitent. It overflows upon a whole guilty people, althô in a manner ripe for vengeance and deſtruction, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a thorough and univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in it: and this, althò God had denounced ſpeedy ruin to it.
<q>At what inſtant,</q>
ſays God by the prophet,
<q>I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to pull down, and to deſtroy it; if that nation againſt whom I have pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, turn from the evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.<note n="c" place="margin">Jerem. XVIII.7, 8.</note>
               </q>
This declaration, and gracious promiſe of God relates, indeed, more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to his providential diſpenſations in
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008667_0044_102fadc8f5fdd6a0"/>
this world, than to his dealings with people in another: And being conſidered in this light, it was remarkably verified in his conduct towards the people of Nineveh, tho' pagans. He had ſent his prophet to denounce wrath and deſtruction againſt that great, and very wicked city, even within forty days. But the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and proclaimed a faſt; and the king ſaid,
<q>Let man and beaſt put on ſackcloth, and cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not? <note n="d" place="margin">Jomah III. 7, —</note>
               </q>
It follows,
<q>And God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</q>
Thus gracious and long-ſuffering; thus ſlow to anger and plenteous in mercy; thus ready to forgive iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin, even the ſins of an whole people, upon their repentance, did God both proclaim and manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be; and this, even long before the ſetting up of that diſpenſation in the world, which is more properly called the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his grace.

to futurity, and as extending their influence to another ſtate of exiſtence, were not fully revealed, and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, but by the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh; to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf; and thus by one offering, to

            </p>
            <p>THE goſpel is ſo eminently a revelation of pardon, and mercy, and grace, to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, that the apoſtle makes this its characteriſtick; calling it the
<q>goſpel of the grace of God;</q>
and ſometimes "grace" in the abſtract, as if there were nothing in it but what was compriſed in this term. At other times, it is
<q>the word of reconciliation</q>:
—
<q>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt; and hath given to Us the miniſtry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them<note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. V. 18, 19.</note>.</q>
—And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably hereto, repentance, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, are ſpoken of as a ſummary of that goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which our Lord commanded his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to preach thro'out the world. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Saviour's reſurrection, and juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his aſcenſion into heaven, he ſaid to his choſen apoſtles, whoſe underſtandings
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:008667_0046_102fadcddec76118"/>
he then opened in ſome meaſure, that they might underſtand the ſcriptures—
<q>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day: And that repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name, among all nations, beginning at Jeruſalem. And ye are witneſſes of theſe things.<note n="g" place="margin">Luke XXIV. 46 47, 48.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>AGREEABLE to this general account of the evangelical diſpenſation, the new teſtament abounds with declarations of God's mercy, and the pardon of ſin, to all truly humble, penitent, and reformed tranſgreſſors. Theſe offers are ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſo univerſally known, that it ſeems needleſs to produce any particular examples. However, to ſhow you how exceeding ready and willing God is to forgive thoſe who return to him; I ſhall juſt remind you of our Saviour's well-known parable of the prodigal ſon <note n="h" place="margin">Luk. XV 11,—</note> which is indeed very moving and affecting, even conſidered without its deſigned reference to the manner of God's dealing with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners. This fooliſh youth is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to forſake his father's houſe, where he had bread enough and to ſpare; and to go into a far diſtant country. Here he ſoon waſtes his ſubſtance in riotous living; is neceſſitated to betake himſelf to the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008667_0047_102fadd46cc428c8"/>
baſeſt employments for a ſubſiſtence; and wiſhes in vain to ſatisfy himſelf with the huſks which the ſwine fed upon. He at length awakes, as it were, out of a long and deep ſleep; and "comes to himſelf." He thinks upon his ways, and ariſes to go to his father with that humble and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential confeſſion,
<q>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon.</q>
—
<q>But when he was yet a great way off, his father ſaw him, and had compaſſion on him, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him.</q>
The ſon then makes his confeſſion and acknowledgment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his reſolution while he was yet in a far country. But the father, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at the unexpected return of his ſon, inſtead of upbraiding him with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful conduct, is concerned only to give him a kind welcome—
<q>Bring forth the beſt robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger, and ſhoes on his feet. And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat and be merry. For this my ſon was dead, and is alive again; he was loſt, and is found.</q>
There cannot, I think, be a ſtronger, or more affecting repreſentation, than our Saviour gives us in this parable, of the great compaſſion of God towards
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008667_0048_102fadd6840f5a38"/>
ſinful men, who at length penitently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him, how far ſoever they have gone aſtray from him; of his willingneſs to meet them upon their return from their wanderings, with the bowels and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a father; of his rejoicing at an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to receive them, and to beſtow upon them the tokens of his love: For ſuch
<q>joy ſhall be in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>YOU ſee then, that if the pardon of our ſins is of any value or importance to us, how much it concerns us to turn our feet unto God's teſtimonies, and to keep his commandments. For if we do the latter, we ſhall certainly obtain the former. He, againſt whom, and whom only we have ſinned, has been pleaſed, thrô his dear ſon, to promiſe his pardoning mercy to all that are truly penitent. And if, with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and contrite hearts, we confeſs our ſins, as the prodigal did, we may ſecurely rely on his word, that
<q>he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs. <note n="i" place="margin">1 John 1.9.</note>
               </q>
And, oh! how ſweet is the voice of pardon to the guilty conſcience, and wounded ſpirit of an awakened ſinner? How much more refreſhing, than
<q>good news from a far country, or cold water to the thirſty ſoul?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:008667_0049_102faddb4cc79f28"/>THERE are moreover many promiſes, or at leaſt gracious encouragements given us in the holy ſcriptures, that if we return to God by ſincere repentance, and keep his commandments, we ſhall reap great advantages by it even in this life.
<q>In keeping his commandments there is [now] great reward.</q>
And godlineſs is ſaid to be profitable unto all things,
<q>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſe of the life that now is,</q>
as well as of that which is to come. God has given us leave to hope, and to expect, that if we fear him and work righteouſneſs, we ſhall be favoured with the ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, guidance, and outward bleſſings of his providence, during our pilgrimage in this world. The evils and perils, to which human life is naturally expoſed, and which we are unable to guard againſt, or to remove, are very great and numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: So that it highly concerns us to have a friend and protector more wiſe and powerful than we are ourſelves: One who can foreſee and avert the evils which are likely to befal us; or lead us, perhaps quite imperceptibly to ourſelves, into the proper methods of eſcaping them; or mitigate them when they come upon us; or ſanctify them to us for our real benefit; and to cauſe all things, even thoſe which are reckoned the moſt calamitous,
<q>to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:008667_0050_102fadde37926cd8"/>
work together for good</q>
to us. How deſireable and happy is it, to have ſuch a guide, protector and friend? And ſuch an one do we all obtain in God moſt high, by turning our feet unto his teſtimonies, and keeping his commandments. His ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is ever nigh to them that fear him: He will be their guardian and their God; their ſun and ſhield. He will beſtow upon them outward, temporal bleſſings, as far as ſuch things are beſt for them: He will defend them from external, worldly evils and ſorrows; ſuch, I mean, as would be really prejudicial to them upon the whole: He will enable them to bear ſuch as he permits to befal them, and render them ſalutary and uſeful, as the means of making them wiſer and better.</p>
            <p>NOW theſe are ſome of the ſpecial pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of good men, the ſons of God; privileges which belong to them, and only to them, who keep his commandments. For there are no promiſes of this nature, made to the workers of iniquity: But, there are many threatnings, that God will afflict them with ſore temporal calamities; that he will confound their devices, and fruſtrate their hopes; that he will turn even their bleſſings into curſes; and in all reſpects walk contrary to thoſe, who walk contrary to him, in their evil ways.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:008667_0051_102fade1b33d9978"/>NOR are the privileges of the righteous which I have juſt now mentioned incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ones, thô they are not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. They do not conſiſt merely in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings, or an exemption from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny external evils and vexations which others undergo. They compriſe in them peace of mind, and a ſenſe of ſecurity, in times of the greateſt trial and adverſity. This is in ſome degree the natural reſult of faith in God, and a conſcience void of offence towards him. For which reaſon it is ſpoken of in ſcripture, as the fruit and effect of righteouſneſs:
<q>The work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ever. And my people ſhall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</q>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Iſaiah XXXII.17, 18.</note> Agreeably hereto it is ſaid of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (which, in the writings of Solomon, generally means the knowledge of God, and forming the heart and manners aright) that
<q>length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor. Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth her.<note n="l" place="margin">Prov. III 16, 17, 18</note>
               </q>
The experience of all good men does, in ſome meaſure, verify theſe obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:008667_0052_102fade37b522c28"/>
the ſuperior happineſs attending the ways of religion and virtue. And now, if it be of any conſequence to us to live peaceably and happily in this world; if, of any, to have the all-powerful and gracious protection of divine providence; and to enjoy ſerenity of mind in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of our Maker's favour; then it is of equal importance to us to turn our feet unto his teſtimonies, and to keep his commandments; this being the only way to obtain thoſe bleſſings.
<q>For there is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</q>
Evil continually purſueth ſinners, and very often overtaketh them in the preſent life: So that with what they actually feel, and what they fear, from a conſciouſneſs of their ill deſerts, they are
<q>like the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt forth mire and dirt.</q>
We cannot therefore, if we believe theſe things, but acknowledge that it is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to us to forſake our ſins, and keep the commandments of our God, only from a conſideration of the preſent comfort and happineſs attending a life devoted to his ſervice.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, this is but the beginning of joy with thoſe, who return to God by unfeigned repentance, and live in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his commandments. Look beyond
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:008667_0053_102fadeaad1b5d00"/>
this narrow ſpan of human life; and you ſee pleaſures infinitely ſuperior to any that are enjoyed here; a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory; an happineſs unallayed by any root of bitterneſs; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in degree; undecaying with time; unlimited in duration; and uncloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with poſſeſſion. God has choſen us in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, not only that we might be at peace with him, and bleſſed of him, while the world ſtandeth; but more eſpecially, that in the ages which are to come, and which never will expire,
<q>he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us, through Jeſus Chriſt:</q>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Eph. II.7.</note> i. e. towards all thoſe who hearken to the admonitions of his word, and the invitations of his mercy, ſo as to turn from their evil ways, and keep his holy commandments. The ſouls of the righteous are always in the hand of the Lord; and they are no ſooner enlarged from theſe earthly tabernacles, than they are carried by angels into Abraham's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, the paradiſe of God. Here they are at peace, and in joy, even before their mortal and corruptible part is laid in the grave, and the duſt returns to the duſt, as it was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:008667_0054_102f74f027af0ad8"/>IN this unknown, but bliſsful region, we may conclude from the intimations given us in ſcripture, the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, remain in joyful expectation of the redemption of their bodies; enjoying in the mean time, by anticipation, and the full aſſurance of faith and hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that complete and perfect ſalvation which Chriſt has wrought out for them, and which, in the judgment of the great day, he will beſtow upon all them that look for him, and love his appearing. At which time all the redeemed and ranſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Lord; all who were ſo wiſe during their ſtate of trial, as to accept the redemption offered them, by performing the terms on which it was offered, ſhall be clothed with glorious and immortal bodies: and ſtanding on the right hand of their enthroned Lord and great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, ſhall hear that ſentence from him,
<q>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</q>
Which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſhall not only abſolve them forever from all guilt, and give them an eternal divorce from all pain and ſorrow, the fruit of ſin, and the effect of the curſe; but put them in the immediate poſſeſſion of that inheritance, incorruptible and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and that fadeth not away, which
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008667_0055_102fadec328ff458"/>
is promiſed to the ſons and heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt. But I preſume not to give any particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the glorious ſtate, and happineſs of the righteous hereafter; knowing that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mortal man,
<q>the things which God has prepared for them that love him.</q>
We are aſſured in general, from the holy ſcriptures, that they ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not only infinitely beyond their deſerts, but beyond their preſent conceptions and wiſhes; and thus bleſſed forevermore.</p>
            <p>NOW I hope I need not ſpend time to prove to any man in his ſenſes, that it is a thing of importance to him, whether he does, or does not obtain an happineſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded and everlaſting; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether he does, or does not turn his feet unto God's teſtimonies; ſince we are certain that they only who do the latter, ſhall enjoy the former. We know that into that thrice glorious kingdom which God has prepared for his friends and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, no unclean thing ſhall enter; neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or that maketh a lie: but the holy, that do his commandments, the redeemed and ranſomed of the Lord, ſhall aſcend, and live, and ſhine glorious there, with ſongs,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:008667_0056_102fadedd5adf8f8"/>
and everlaſting joy upon their heads. And he that is in the midſt of the throne, ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them to living fountains of water; and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes. If you think it of any importance to you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come partakers of ſuch an happineſs as this, i. e. the greateſt which God has to beſtow, certainly you cannot think it a matter of indifference to you, whether you comply with the terms of it, by repenting of your ſins, and turning your feet unto God's teſtimonies; or finally cut yourſelves off from it, by perſevering in your ſinful courſes. But,</p>
            <p>LET us now proceed to the fourth and laſt thing mentioned for the illuſtration of this firſt general head of diſcourſe; which is,</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi> THE aſtoniſhing method which God has projected for our ſalvation from the dominion of ſin, and the puniſhment due to it: you know I mean the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and ſufferings, the life and death, of his own dear Son here on earth. This matter being attentively, thô but briefly conſidered, will ſet the great importance of turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keeping his commandments, in a ſtronger point of light; and give an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional degree of weight and force to the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008667_0057_102fadf143817218"/>
arguments that have been already inſiſted on. You are ſenſible that the particular means or method, by which God offers to deliver us from any evil, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or ſpiritual, is of diſtinct conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that evil itſelf. So alſo, the particular means or method, by which he offers to confer upon us any good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporal or eternal, is of diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration from the good itſelf. It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over evident, that theſe means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods may be of ſuch a nature, as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enhance the favour, and add to the bleſſing; or, at leaſt, of ſuch a nature, as to give us a more ſtriking and affecting idea of its worth and importance; and conſequently of the importance of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which may be requiſite, on our part, in order to render effectual the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious purpoſes of heaven towards us.</p>
            <p>NOW this is the caſe with reſpect to the matter under conſideration. It is plainly a thing of great importance to us to turn our feet unto God's teſtimonies, that we may receive the remiſſion of ſins, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternal life and glory in the kingdom of heaven. But ſurely the importance hereof appears in a ſtill ſtronger light to us, when we reflect particularly upon what God has done, in the way of means, in order to bring us to repentance, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:008667_0058_102fadf2cbbb0570"/>
to our obtaining forgiveneſs, and a title to future glory, honor and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. That end muſt be of inconceivably great importance to us, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of which, God ſpared not his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son, but delivered him up for us all; that end, for which the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, emptied himſelf of his glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and became incarnate, dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and exchanging the form of God for the form of a ſervant; that end, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of which he, according to the will, and eternal purpoſe of God, thôt it worth his while to become our inſtructor and guide, our monitor and example, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God had raiſed up ſo many holy men and prophets to preach righteouſneſs to the world, and call ſinners to repentance; that end, for which ſo glorious a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage as he by whom God created all things, condeſcended to undergo ſo many trials and ſufferings for a number of years, in our world and nature, not having where to lay his head, thò the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts: that end, for the accompliſhing of which, he not only became a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with the common griefs which are incident to humanity; but to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:008667_0059_102fadfa303b5dc8"/>
very peculiar and extraordinary ones, ſo that there were no griefs in all reſpects like to his, whether we conſider the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of thoſe ſinners whom he came to redeem, which he endured againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or thoſe temptations and vexations of ſatan, to which he was ſubjected, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when his laſt ſufferings approached; when he was in an agony, and ſweat as it were great drops of blood, falling from his face to the ground: In fine, that end, for the accompliſhing of which he poured out his ſoul unto death, the accurſed death of the croſs, and was made a curſe for us. That end, for which God gave his Son to do and ſuffer theſe things, and for which he actually did and ſuffered them, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of God's appointment, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be an end of ſuch importance to us, that it is not fully conceivable by us. We know indeed, in general, what the end hereof actually was, namely, that we might be redeemed from all iniquity, from the power and practice of ſin, from the miſeries of our fallen and corrupt eſtate, from the curſe of the law, and become the ſons and heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt, "the firſt-born among many brethren," to an incorruptible and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance. We know in general, not only that this was the end of our
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:008667_0060_102fadfbd6d6f450"/>
Lord's incarnation, ſufferings and death; but we can alſo ſee in ſome meaſure, that it highly concerns us that this end ſhould be finally accompliſhed with reſpect to us, by our cordially falling in, and co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with, this gracious deſign, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous diſpenſation of providence. But ſtill there is, and muſt be, ſomewhat here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which is unfathomable by us: It is a great deep, which we cannot go to the bottom of: It muſt be ſomewhat of ſo momentous and intereſting a nature to us, that we cannot have a full and adequate conception of it at preſent; neither of the greatneſs of that miſery and deſtruction, to deliver us from which, the Son of God was made manifeſt in the fleſh, lived in ſorrow, and died upon a croſs; nor yet of the greatneſs of that ſalvation which he came to purchaſe for us, and of that glory which is to be revealed in his ſaints. It is a diſpenſation of divine love and grace, which evidently beſpeaks, or indicates, an end and deſign too big and auguſt for our narrow, limited capacities; and indeed the holy angels are repreſented as prying into it with wonder and admiration.</p>
            <p>WE can hardly conceive of an end great enough, a deſign really worthy of ſuch an extraordinary interpoſition of providence: We can hardly imagine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:008667_0061_102fadfdae3fa538"/>
or any thing which relates to us poor mortals, of ſuch importance in the creation of God, that it would be worth while (to ſpeak after the manner of men) for God to be at ſo great an expence for us, or for ſo dignified and glorious a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as the Son of God, by whom all things were made and conſiſt, to come down from heaven, and to ſuffer death with malefactors upon a croſs. But yet we are ſure that all this is in fact true: And what is the conſequence from it? I anſwer, it is plainly this, that we ourſelves are of more conſequence, and our ſouls of more worth than we can well conceive of, or at preſent imagine: That we do not fully know, either what a terrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is implied in that death, which is ſaid to be the "wages of ſin," or the glory and happineſs implied in that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life with God, which is his
<q>gift thrô Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</q>
Both the ruin and miſery of that ſtate of ſin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, from which Chriſt came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us, and the bliſs and glory of that ſtate to which he came to conduct us, are great beyond our preſent comprehenſion. They ſhun our finite capacities, and are in a ſort hidden from us, even by means of their own greatneſs. And we may be certain beforehand, if there be a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:008667_0062_102fadff33720370"/>
and analogy amongſt the works of God; betwixt the diſpenſations of his providence towards us in this probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtate, and what is to ſucceed them hereafter, in a ſtate of retribution, that both the ruin of thoſe who perſevere in their rebellion againſt God's righteous laws and government, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe who co-operate with the deſigns of his grace, ſhall far ſurpaſs any thing of miſery upon one hand, and of bliſs and glory upon the other, that we can now conceive of by the utmoſt ſtretch of imagination. It was not, ſurely, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from ſome inconſiderable evil, nor to procure for us an inconſiderable good, that the Son of God came into this apoſtate world, and liv'd and died therein, in the manner repreſented to us in the holy ſcriptures! Here it is that we ſee as far, perhaps, as it is poſſible for us to ſee at preſent, the importance of turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keeping his commandments: We ſee the vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance hereof more fully and clearly by contemplating upon the mediation of Chriſt, and trying to enlarge our thôts to ſomething future, that may correſpond to ſo great an interpoſition of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and grace, than we can, even by contemplating the expreſs threatnings and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:008667_0063_102fae06a60c7698"/>
promiſes of God in his word, thô ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully calculated to fill us with awful apprehenſions on one hand, and with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hopes on the other. Unleſs we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with the deſign of Chriſt's coming into the world, by exerciſing repentance towards God, and faith towards him, and living in obedience to his commandments, we ſhall not only have no lot or portion hereafter, with them that reap the glorious fruits of his mediation; but ſuffer the full demerit of our ſins, and amongſt others, that of
<q>treading under foot the Son of God.</q>
So that altho' we have now all of us reaſon to rejoice, yet we may hereafter have occaſion to lament, that ever there was
<q>born to us in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Chriſt the Lord!</q>
For certainly it had been far better for us, if God had left us to periſh finally in the ruins of the common apoſtacy, than that He ſhould have been ſo good and gracious as to offer us, and we ſo evil and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to reject, ſo great ſalvation!</p>
            <p>AND thus we have done with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral heads of argument, by which it was propoſed to ſhow, of what vaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it is to ſinful men to turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; thò it is impoſſible fully and adequately to repreſent it, or even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:008667_0064_102fae082e2e3078"/>
of it: For every thing that relates to infinity and eternity, puzzle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found us, ſo that we can neither think nor ſpeak with due juſtneſs and propriety of them, even when religion is out of the queſtion. But whether you conſider the greatneſs, majeſty and holineſs of God, and his power diſplayed thro' out the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, which power may be equally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for our welfare or deſtruction: Whether you conſider the expreſs and repeated declarations of his word, reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the final perdition of wicked and ungodly men, the truth of which cannot be doubted of: Whether you conſider the great and precious promiſes which he has made in his holy word, to thoſe who turn at his reproof, and do that which is lawful and right: Or, laſtly, whether you conſider the aſtoniſhing method which his wiſdom and unutterable love have projected for our redemption from ſin, and its effects, and for bringing many ſons unto glory, by Jeſus Chriſt his Son, made perfect through ſufferings: Whether you conſider one or the other of theſe things properly, ſtill the vaſt importance of forſaking your ſins, and keeping God's commandments, will appear in a very ſtrong and convincing light; ſo that every man who has any eyes to ſee, or ears to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:008667_0065_102fae09d6e88468"/>
hear, muſt be ſenſible of it. And if either of theſe things, ſeparately conſidered, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the importance hereof ſo clearly, and ſhows it to be the higheſt degree of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence and folly, not to ſay of impiety, for men to go on in the allowed violation of God's commandments; of how much greater importance does this appear, when we lay all theſe conſiderations together? when the force of all theſe arguments, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which is really of infinite weight, is united, and brôt into one view, into one comprehenſive argument for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our lives, and devoting them to the ſervice of God! When all theſe ſcattered rays of truth and reaſon, are brought to a proper point, ſo as to ſtrike the mind at once, it might be ſuppoſed, that men's hearts would not only be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, but quite overpowered, melted and diſſolved, unleſs they were of ſuch a nature and temper, that neither reaſon nor revelation, which are both from the ſame great Father of lights, could have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them. The God of this world muſt have ſtrangely blinded the eyes of ſuch men, leſt the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of the inviſible God, ſhould ſhine into them; and make them diſcern the things that belong unto their peace, before theſe
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:008667_0066_102fae0d0dad09a0"/>
things are, in a ſtill more awful ſenſe, hidden from them!</p>
            <p>THE time is too far elapſed to proceed to another head of diſcourſe. I am not willing to ſuſpect, either the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or the hearts of any of you, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved hearers, ſo far as to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you do not plainly ſee, and even feel, the force of theſe arguments, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite importance of fearing God, and keeping his commandments. No! I will not doubt but that you are deeply ſenſible, your whole intereſt and well-being, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it. Not only our bible, but the whole viſible creation, contains lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of wiſdom, of warning, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to them that have eyes to ſee; it is a mighty volume, profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction and inſtruction in righteouſneſs, if we will but read, and meditate upon it. God ſpeaks to us daily, in all his providences; even in the moſt common of them, in order to excite us to that reverence of, and obedience to him, which is our greateſt good. Wiſdom is not only to be ſought or found, in thoſe books and places which we uſually term ſacred:
<q>She crieth without, ſhe uttereth her voice [even] in the Streets: She crieth in the chief place of concourſe, in the opening of the gates: in the city
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:008667_0067_102fae13a8c6cff0"/>
ſhe uttereth her words, ſaying, How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity? and the ſcorners delight in ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my ſpirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</q>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Prov. I.20—23.</note> This is the voice of wiſdom to you all at preſent, which you may hear in every place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you are like the deaf adder that ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth her ear. O! attend to it, leſt this friendly monitor ſhould turn a bitter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, ſaying,
<q>Becauſe I have called, and ye have refuſed,</q>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ver. 24.</note> &amp;c. Let me beſeech you in the name of Him, whoſe I am, and whom I am endeavouring to ſerve, thô in much weakneſs, to bear theſe important things in your minds; and not merely to remember them, but to practiſe agreeably to them, by turning your feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keeping his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. You cannot but know, that this is a reaſonable and wiſe part for you to act; and not only conducive in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but abſolutely neceſſary, to your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture well-being; to your eſcaping the wrath to come, and being immortally happy in the kingdom and preſence of God, when momentary ages are paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and forgotten. Be wiſe, then, for yourſelves: and let not, I will not ſay,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:008667_0068_102fae153b718780"/>
me, but, the whole creation, preach to you in vain. Know, O man! woman! child! Know, that it is not God, but thou, thyſelf, that will reap the advantage of thy wiſdom, thy repentance, thy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For, can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wiſe may be profitable unto himſelf? Is it any pleaſure unto the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or will it be gain to Him, if thou makeſt thy way perfect? Look unto the heavens, and ſee, and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. If thou ſinneſt, what doeſt thou againſt Him that made both them and thee? Or if thy tranſgreſſions be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, what harm doeſt thou unto Him? If thou art righteous, what giveſt thou Him? or what receiveth He of thine hand? Thy wickedneſs may indeed hurt a poor, weak, dependent creature, as thou art; or thy righteouſneſs may profit thee, the ſon or daughter of man; but not Him, before whom all nations are as the ſmall duſt of the balance, and are counted to Him as leſs than nothing and vanity. The reſult of all, therefore, is this,—

               <note place="margin">SERM III.</note>THE great importance of turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keeping his commandments, has been ſhown in two preceeding diſcourſes; and more eſpecially from theſe conſiderations;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:008667_0070_102fae18a1d6eef0"/>THE power and greatneſs of God, his holineſs and univerſal dominion, and our abſolute dependence upon him:</p>
            <p>THE clear and poſitive denunciations of his wrath, in his word, againſt all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, irreclaimable tranſgreſſors:</p>
            <p>THE great and precious promiſes of the goſpel, made to thoſe who turn at God's reproof, and keep his commandments:</p>
            <p>And laſtly,</p>
            <p>THE aſtoniſhing method which God has projected for our ſalvation from the dominion of ſin, and the puniſhment due to it.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations make it manifeſt, how greatly it concerns us to break off our ſins by repentance, and to walk before God in holineſs and righteouſneſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his commandments; which was the firſt general point propoſed, in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the preſent ſubject. The ſecond ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral head, to which we now proceed, was,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, To ſhow, by a variety of arguments, the vaſt importance of being ſpeedy in this buſineſs; of making haſte to keep God's commandments; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme folly and danger of delaying it.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, it is only one argument that will be inſiſted upon at preſent, with this view; which ſhall be drawn from a
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:008667_0071_102fae2069881868"/>
conſideration of the ſhortneſs of human life, and the uncertain duration of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationary ſtate. Divers other arguments will be left to ſucceeding diſcourſes. For I ſhall chooſe to confine myſelf to a ſingle point in each diſcourſe, rather than to run the hazard of perplexing and diſtracting your minds by too great a variety. And beſides, the arguments which will, by God's leave and help, be inſiſted upon, ſeem to be ſo weighty and momentous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that each of them may well claim a large and diſtinct conſideration, by itſelf.</p>
            <p>IT may be reaſonably preſumed, that you are all in general convinced, that it is both your duty and higheſt intereſt to turn your feet unto God's teſtimonies, and to keep his commandments: but poſſibly you may not ſo clearly perceive the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being ſpeedy herein, as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt was, who tells us, that he
<q>made haſte and delayed not.</q>
There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons who will not pretend to deny, but that it is of the laſt importance to them to repent of their ſins, and reform their lives; who yet cannot be perſuaded of the reaſonableneſs and importance of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this immediately, without any delay; but will be for deferring it to ſome future opportunity, which they imagine will be more convenient for them, and anſwer the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:008667_0072_102fae226717e388"/>
end as well in other reſpects. It is indeed here, that one of the greateſt dangers lies, of mens finally periſhing in their ſins: So that when they are convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and importance of a reformation in general, they are to be ſhown the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and importance of beginning it without any delay; otherwiſe the time may perhaps never come, which ſuits them in all reſpects; and ſo they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the better for that general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, which they have of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of leading a better life.</p>
            <p>Now thô there were no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to inforce a ſpeedy repentance and amendment, beſides that which was juſt mentioned above, the ſhortneſs of human life, and the uncertain continuance of our ſtate of trial; yet this alone would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely concluſive; ſo as to convict that perſon of the greateſt imprudence and madneſs, who ſhould defer the thoughts of returning to God and his duty, a ſingle day or hour; ſince we know not what a day or hour may bring forth, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which is let ſlip, and is loſt to day, may be loſt forever! Whenever there is any thing which is in itſelf of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and concernment to us in this world; (if indeed there is any thing here below that can be juſtly accounted ſo) and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:008667_0073_102fae23f39d1ab0"/>
when, by neglecting it at preſent, we may probably miſs of ſome great temporal good, or incur ſome great temporal evil, and render the damage irretrievable to us; whenever this is the caſe, as to our worldly buſineſs and concernments, it is the plain dictate of reaſon and prudence to embrace the preſent time, and not to let ſlip the opportunity which we actually have, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſtant and uncertain proſpect of another afterwards. And this is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule and maxim, by which all men that are tolerably wiſe and prudent in their temporal affairs, invariably conduct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for
<q>the children of this world are in their generation wiſer than the children of light;</q>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luke XVI.8.</note> more wary and provident, and more careful to improve their ſeveral opportunities to ſecure their worldly advantage, than they who are favoured with ſpiritual privileges, and a ſpace for repentance, are to
<q>make their calling and election ſure;</q>
and entitle themſelves to eternal life and ſalvation. Our Saviour takes occaſion to teach us a leſſon of prudence in our ſpiritual and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal concernments, from the conduct and example of ſuch children of this world, as neglect not to improve their preſent opportunities; nor put off 'til to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, that which ſhould be done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:008667_0074_102fae25804ce780"/>
Conſider, therefore, their ways, and be wiſe.</p>
            <p>THE careful huſbandman obſerves the firſt opening of the ſpring, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of the ſun with his genial warmth: He conſiders the approaching ſummer, the autumnal ſeaſon, and ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent winter. In the ſpring he manures, ſows and plants his fields; in the ſummer he dreſſes them,
<q>waiting for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious fruit of the earth;</q>
and in autumn he gathers his harveſt into barns, that he may have all manner of ſtore, when the ſeaſon is paſt for that kind of labor, and winter confines him at home. Did you ever know a diſcrete huſbandman, who did not thus conſider times, ſeaſons and opportunities; and lay hold upon them as they arrived, leſt, letting them ſlip, he ſhould be deſtitute of the means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence? Fools, and ſlothful men, may indeed be guilty of ſuch negligence, and only they: And ſuch are accordingly ſent to learn wiſdom even of the ant, or piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire:
<q>Go to the ant thou ſluggard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider her ways, and be wiſe: which having no guide, overſeer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the ſummer, and gathereth her food in the harveſt.<note n="b" place="margin">Prov. VI 6, 7, 8.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IF you conſider the diſcrete mariner, you will find in him the ſame care, and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:008667_0075_102fae2d337b0420"/>
attention to times and opportunities. Knowing that winds, and tides, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will not conform to his inclinations, or wait his pleaſure, he prudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms himſelf to them, as far as poſſible. When the weather is fair, the gale from the proper point, and the tide ſerves, he weighs anchor, ſpreads his ſails, and takes the helm, leſt he ſhould miſs his paſſage, and by unneceſſary delays, be kept from the country and port for which he is bound.</p>
            <p>THE diſcrete merchant, the object of whoſe attention is worldly gain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, acts in conformity to the ſame pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial maxim, of obſerving times and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; which, being once ſlipped, may never return. Does he not carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the riſe and fall of ſtocks, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt? Does he not diligently inquire into the ſtate of foreign markets; and into an hundred other things and circumſtances, which are in their nature fluctuating and changeable, that, by improving his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and the critical time, he may make ſure of ſomething; and promote his intereſt to the utmoſt? Will he neglect a preſent favourable opportunity, when he knows not but that delaying a day or two, may not only put it out of his power to make great profit to himſelf, but prove ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:008667_0076_102fae2ec0953350"/>
to his fortunes, and reduce him to bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy? Certainly a cautious, prudent mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant will not be guilty of ſuch negligence; but improve every fair opportunity that preſents itſelf, while it is in his power.</p>
            <p>DOES not every wiſe general, or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent commander, act upon the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple? Will ſuch an one neglect a preſent advantage againſt the enemy, ſuch a one as almoſt ſecures ſucceſs and triumph to him; when he knows not but that his omitting it, may ſoon give the enemy as great, or a greater advantage againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; not only ſnatch a victory from him, but prove the occaſion of his being ſpoiled and captivated?</p>
            <p>IN ſhort do not all men in general act upon this ſame prudential maxim in their ſecular affairs and concernments, even from the ermin'd monarchs, the great warriours and politicians of the earth, down to the cobler upon his ſtall? You may plainly ſee this principle of warineſs and caution operating, and exerting it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, thrô all the various ranks of human life, from the throne to the footſtool; there are no men who are not governed by it in their worldly buſineſs, excepting thoſe only, whom all the world agrees to call, either giddy or ſtupid, ſlothful or mad. Every individual, that has any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:008667_0077_102fae3073ff3010"/>
to be reckoned knowing in his own proper concerns, and wiſe for himſelf in this world, is habitually influenced by it. It is the diſcernment of times, and the improvement of opportunities, that makes wiſe men, and the not obſerving, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting them, that makes fools, in all ſecular and earthly affairs. Prudent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought is the parent of plenty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; delay is the mother of want, ſhame and wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>APPLY this to yourſelves in your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er capacity, and more important intereſt, as you ſtand related to God, and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. Reflect how much more ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational and fooliſh it is for men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinate in things of a ſpiritual nature, and eternal concernment, than to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory in their worldly concernments. This life is the ſeaſon for planting and cultivating thoſe ſeeds of piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which may yield us a harveſt of the fruits of righteouſneſs; that we may reap immortal felicity, and make proviſion for ourſelves againſt the winter of death that is approaching. We are all mariners, bound to another country to another world; and now is the time to weigh anchor, to ſpread our ſails, and ſhape our courſe, towards the haven of endleſs peace and joy. There is a pearl of great price
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:008667_0078_102fae320ba1e3d8"/>
ſet before us, which, like wiſe merchants, we ſhould endeavour to make ſure of, thô at the expence of every thing elſe which we poſſeſs; and without uſing any delay, leſt the opportunity ſhould be over for making ourſelves rich towards God, before we are aware; and we ſhould be caſt into that priſon, from whence we ſhall not come out,
<q>'til we have paid the uttermoſt farthing.</q>
There is vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and triumph, and an unfading crown of glory in view; obtaining which, we ſhall be more than conquerors thrô him that loved us; and miſſing of which, we ſhall be far more wretched than cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;—puniſhed as rebels and traitors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the king of heaven!</p>
            <p>SO important is the intereſt which we have depending; and all depending upon our making a wiſe and diligent improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this preſent life; the only oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which we have, or may expect, in order to work out our ſalvation. That this ſeaſon cannot be very long, and that it may poſſibly be very ſhort, we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually certain. The life of man, when protracted to its greateſt length, in this period of the world, is but an
<q>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth;</q>
and it is, beſides, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uncertain. And whenever it is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, our time of trial, you know, is
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:008667_0079_102fae38deef1528"/>
over; ſo that nothing then remains for us, but to
<q>receive the things done in the body, according to that we have done, whether it be good or evil.</q>
Can there be any thing more reaſonable for us then, than to make haſte? any thing more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, than delaying to keep God's commandments? Can you think of any negligence of men in their worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, but what is infinitely leſs foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and abſurd, than this negligence and delay, which are ſo common with reſpect to religion, and the concerns of eternity? If men are negligent and imprudent in their worldly concernments, there is ſtill a poſſibility of retrieving: Seaſons may return; another ſpring and ſeed-time to the huſbandman, another wind to the mariner, another lucky opportunity to the merchant, another advantage to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. But
<q>the accepted time, and the day of ſalvation,</q>
being once over, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return to the probationer for another world. This life being run out, the time of trial which God has allotted us, is paſt; we know of no other; we are to expect no other. For as it is
<q>appointed unto men once to die,</q>
ſo
<q>after that is the judgment;</q>
and God will then
<q>render to every man according to his deeds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:008667_0080_102fae3be4732188"/>AND what now is human life, upon which ſo much depends? Is it like the conſtant ſun, which burns and ſhines thrô a long ſucceſſion of years, ſo that there is no danger of its going out, and leaving us, thò we ſhould neglect our proper bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs for the preſent? Is it not rather like a little meteor, that darts along the ſky, and both appears, and is wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, in a moment? in the ſame breath? Or, to uſe a ſcripture-compariſon, is it not like a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſhes away, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon as the ſun is riſen? Is it not like the graſs? In the morning it flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and groweth up; but at noon it is cut down and withereth. Man knoweth not his time; nor what ſhall be, even on the morrow. If therefore he is wiſe, he will make haſte, and not delay to keep God's commandments to day; leſt, thrô ſuch negligence, he ſhould ſuddenly fall into laſting and irretrievable ruin.</p>
            <p>I WILL not now aſk you, where your fathers are, or whether the prophets live for ever? But let me aſk you, Where are many of your cotemporaries? Where are many of your friends and acquaintance, who made their appearance upon the ſtage of this life, about the ſame time that you did yourſelves? Are they all living?
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:008667_0081_102fae3dc3646c68"/>
Are none of them removed far from you, into darkneſs? If you go and examine the tombs and monuments in our burial-places, will you not find the names of many of them? ſome perhaps newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved, but others that begin to moulder with time; intimating to you, how long your brother or ſiſter, your wife, huſband, or dear friend, has been in eternity! Yea, I may aſk you, Where are many that are younger than you? that were born ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years after you? Are they all ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live? Are they all ſtill probationers for their eternal ſtate? Or is not that ſtate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fixed with reſpect to divers of thoſe, who entered upon their ſtate of trial ſome years after you? Yea, let me aſk ſtill far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Where are ſome of your own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? the offspring of your bodies? Are they all alive, and flouriſhing like plants of renown? Alas! are not ſome of thoſe, who were brôt into the world by you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God the common parent, gone out of it before you, leaving you to mourn their untimely exit! It may be further enquired, Where are many that were not only much younger than you, but alſo, once, more healthy, ſtrong and vigorous? of firmer nerves and ſinews? of more robuſt conſtitutions? and who were therefore, according to human rules of probability,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:008667_0082_102fae41036d5d78"/>
likely to ſurvive you, and to weep, or perhaps to rejoice, over your graves? Are all ſuch, whom you once knew, ſtill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving? Are not many of them, years ſince, taken off the ſtage, and numbered with the dead, not to riſe again, 'til the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens be no more!</p>
            <p>LET me inquire a little farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner and circumſtances of their death; I mean the death of thoſe, whom you once knew, and who were at leaſt as likely, if not more ſo, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive you, than you was to out-live them. To proceed then; had they all ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable warning given them of their danger, and approaching diſſolution? Did they all lie for ſeveral months, or weeks, upon the bed of ſickneſs? Did they all languiſh away by ſuch ſlow degrees, and die ſuch a lingering death, as gave them, if I may ſo expreſs it, fair warning to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it, by making their peace with God, and ſettling their accounts with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? ſo that after they were unable to walk the earth, they might turn their feet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's teſtimonies, and run the way of his commandments? What! Were none of them ſuddenly ſnatched away, as in a moment, by ſome violent, rapid diſeaſe, which had no ſooner ſeized, than it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them? or, at leaſt, took from them
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:008667_0083_102fae47889eeca8"/>
the exerciſe of their rational faculties, ſo as to diſqualify them for religious reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and amendment? Were none of them taken away by what is called, thò perhaps not very piouſly, a fortuitous, caſual, or accidental death; ſo as to be in another world, even before they had the leaſt apprehenſions of any danger; and were buſily employed, either in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting ſome old, or laying ſome new ſcheme of worldly wealth, grandeur, or pleaſure?</p>
            <p>CAN you call to your remembrance no one example of either of theſe ſorts? Or rather, can you not call to mind ſeveral, yea, many ſuch. And doſt thou know, O man, whoſoever thou art, that this will not be thy own caſe? that the Son of man will not come at an hour when thou lookeſt not for him? Doſt thou aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly know, that thy life will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee before to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? before this day's ſun is ſet? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another hour is expired? yea, before thou haſt heard the end of this, and the beginning of another ſentence?—Thou knoweſt not what a mighty change a ſingle moment may produce with reſpect to thee, now, or any other time. And wilt thou riſque thy ſoul? thy eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt? thy all, at ſuch uncertainties?
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:008667_0084_102fae4942091a58"/>
Wilt thou preſume to go on in thy treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes againſt Him, in whoſe hand thy breath is, and who may ſuddenly deprive thee of it, even before thou haſt drawed another; and call thee before his dread tribunal, all unprepared as thou art? Wilt thou not make haſte to keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, leſt a moment's delay ſhould prove thy final ruin? Wilt thou, when thy life, and time of trial, are thus preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, think it time enough to turn thy feet unto God's teſtimonies, ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years hence? Yea, wilt thou think it time enough to do this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, which, to thee, may never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive; or, if it arrives, find thee in that diſmal region, where the rich man lift up his eyes, being in torment? Wilt thou not even now humble thy ſoul before the great God, whom thou haſt hitherto been offending by thy crimes? and whoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience may be in a manner at an end with thee? Wilt thou not now awake out of ſleep, and haſte, and fly, to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hope ſet before ſinners in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? Wilt thou ſtill tread under foot the Son of God, whom thou haſt ſo long been wounding, and piercing, and putting to open ſhame, by thy ſins? Wilt thou not even now come to him, that thou mayeſt have eternal life, and eſcape the perdition
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:008667_0085_102fae4b21539dc0"/>
that hangs over thee? come to him, I mean, in the exerciſe of faith towards him, and of repentance towards God; and with humble reſolutions, that, thrô his grace aſſiſting, thou wilt be his faithful and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient ſervant? Alas! thou art worſe than mad, if thou delayeſt this another day.</p>
            <p>IF you knew, my friends and brethren, if you certainly knew, that you had one month longer to live, and only one, in which to work out your ſalvation; at the expiration of which ſhort term, you muſt appear before the judge of all the earth to receive your ſentence from him; this would doubtleſs alarm you. You would be ready to cry out, What ſhall I do to be ſaved! and immediately betake yourſelves to your prayers, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of your lives. You would not commit another wilful ſin; but make haſte, under the apprehenſions of ſo ſhort a ſpace for repentance, and of a ſpeedy reckoning, to keep God's commandments. This may be preſumed concerning almoſt any man, however hardned and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, from what is generally ſeen in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals under ſentence of death; and in other wicked men, when they are told by their phyſicians, or their own fears ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to them, that they are but a little
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:008667_0086_102fae4e311a6f40"/>
while for this world. What diſtreſs are they in? how ſorry for their paſt ſins? how anxious about futurity? how reſolved do they ſeem to be, that they will uſe theſe ſhort remains of life to the beſt advantage; and not trifle away another moment?</p>
            <p>Now if you conſider the matter atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, you will plainly ſee, that you have more reaſon to make haſte, and not delay to keep God's commandments, than if you were ſure you had one month, and no longer to live. For, as the caſe now ſtands with you, you are not certain of another month; nor even of another hour. You may indeed think it probable that you may live ſeveral years; but ſince it is poſſible you may be diſappointed, and that this day is your laſt; ſince it is poſſible your probationary ſtate may end before the evening; and if it ſhould, your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity is entirely over, as much as it would be, if you now ſaw the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, or ſitting upon the throne of his glory, to judge the world; ſince your lives are ſo uncertain, and theſe things are thus, I ſay, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that you have a louder call to make haſte in your preparation for death; and that it is more unreaſonable and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous for you to delay it another day, than if you was certain you had one
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:008667_0087_102fae55a2e797b8"/>
month, and no longer to live. Why then, I beſeech you, will you live as careleſly, as negligently of your eternal intereſt, as if you was ſure of many years to come; and that future opportunites would not be wanting, wherein to do that neceſſary and moſt important work, which you leave undone at preſent? You are ſenſible that you are undone, and your ſouls loſt forever, if you do not turn your feet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's teſtimonies, and learn to keep his commandments, before your lives, and this ſtate of trial, are ended. And ſince you have only a diſtant, and very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proſpect of any future opportunity, whether it be many years hence, or only one, or but a ſingle month; how deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is the hazard which you run by your preſent delay? Or what is there in this world that ſhould tempt you thus to put off, and defer from time to time, the one thing needful!</p>
            <p>WE may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that by far the greater part of thoſe who die in their ſins under the light, and in a ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative belief of the goſpel, had ſome ſenſe of the great importance of religion; that they had at times ſome checks and remorſe of conſcience; ſome deſire to eſcape the condemnation of the wicked, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternal life; and accordingly, that
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:008667_0088_102fae5738afeac8"/>
they frequently reſolved with themſelves, that they would, ſome time or other, break off their wicked lives, and turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies. Yea, 'tis probable there is hardly one of theſe ſinners, amongſt that wretched multitude, who are now lamenting their wickedneſs and impenitence in the regions of woe, but what had often reſolved thus with himſelf, upon occaſion of ſome alarming providences, ſome pathetic diſcourſes, or reading or hearing the promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God in his holy word, which is ſo quick, and powerful, and piercing, at times, even to the hearts of very wicked men. But, alas! death overtook them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time actually came, which ſuited them to ſet about this buſineſs of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in earneſt. They determined, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that they would do it five, ten, or twenty years hence; but to be ſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time of trial was elapſed. Their ſins and luſts were ſo dear to them, and their preſumption upon many years to come, was ſo ſtrong, that it ſeemed, not only very hard and mortifying, but in ſome meaſure unneceſſary alſo, to break off from them at preſent, and make haſte to keep God's commandments. This ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to them like ſeparating choice friends, the friends of their boſom; thô, in reality,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:008667_0089_102fae58f7f0ffc8"/>
only the poiſonous aſps therein, which were unperceived ſtinging and wounding them to death. Thus it is that wicked and fooliſh men go on, hugging and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their luſts; and violating the known, plain commandments of God, from on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to another: and yet, with a ſtrange mixture of faith and infidelity, of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and no conſcience, of piety and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, of love to this world and regard to another, of concern for their ſouls and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of them, hypocritically reſolving that they will not be wicked always, thô fully determined to be ſo at preſent. They imagine they have time enough before them; and God forbid that they ſhould always live that wicked life, and die in their ſins at laſt! They have ſome favorite folly or vanity, to which, having ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a little longer, they will piouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the remainder of their days to the ſervice of God, and ſecure the ſalvation of their ſouls. They have either bought a piece of ground, or a yoke of oxen, or married a wife, or are building, or taking their ſwing at youthful pleaſures; ſo that they beg to be excuſed juſt now; but will be ſure not to let death overtake them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared, the thought of which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure. And what is the conſequence of theſe delays and procraſtinations?
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:008667_0090_102fae5a824ab738"/>
of preſuming thus upon ſeeing many days, and having time enough in ſtore to do that, which ought to be done immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, while it is called to-day? I will tell you plainly what it is, becauſe it may, by the bleſſing of God, prove a ſalutary warning to you, and the means of exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you to improve your preſent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The conſequence is, that theſe fooliſh, preſuming ſinners are damned, before they really conceived themſelves to be in any great danger of damnation. I do not mean that this is always, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally, but very often the conſequence, of ſuch dilatory preſumption. Some men doubtleſs live to repent, according to their hopes and expectations, thrô God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, forbearance, and long-ſuffering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. But many are ſnatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the midſt of their fond preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vain imaginations; having no other opportunity for repentance, beſides that ſeaſon which they thought too ſoon, and therefore neglected. And this is ſo frequently the fatal conſequence of letting ſlip the time actually preſent, that the conſideration hereof may well alarm every ſinner; and excite him to make haſte to keep God's commandments, leſt he himſelf ſhould be another ſad example, how dangerous it is to delay it!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:008667_0091_102fae5c172892d8"/>A MAN who is thorôly and properly ſenſible of the hazard he runs by delaying to turn his feet unto God's teſtimonies; of the danger he is really in, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his delay, of being undone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; cannot uſe any delay in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conſiſtently with the known princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of human nature, and the motives by which men are influenced to action: Which makes it proper and neceſſary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to inculcate a juſt ſenſe of this their danger upon them. If men either diſbelieve the great and fundamental doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of religion, reſpecting future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a pious and holy life; or, if believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, they confidently depend upon living long, and having time enough to repent and amend hereafter; upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe ſuppoſitions it is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it poſſible for them to perſevere in their wicked courſes; and indeed it is improbable that they ſhould do otherwiſe. For as the firſt of theſe errors deſtroys the grand motives to religion in general, by wholly taking away both the hope of a reward, and the fear of puniſhment; the latter greatly weakens them, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving theſe things at a diſtance; and making it appear ſafe for a man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his luſts for the preſent, of which
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:008667_0092_102fae6554b7dd10"/>
he may repent ſome years hence, and be ſaved at laſt. It is not altogether unnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, but rather to be ſuppoſed as a thing of courſe, that in either of theſe caſes a man will go on in his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But it is hardly to be conceived poſſible for a man, who firmly believes the great doctrines of religion, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe reſpecting a future ſtate, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of heaven, and the miſeries of hell; and who has, at the ſame time, a juſt ſenſe of his frailty and mortality, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious his life is, how ſoon his ſtate of trial may be ended, and he called to receive the due reward of his deeds; that this may be on the morrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to-day, the next hour, or the next minute; it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conceived poſſible, I ſay, for a man who both believes the great doctrines of religion, and has ſuch a due, thorough ſenſe of the uncertainty of his life, and ſtate of probation, and the danger he is in of damnation while he continues in his ſins, to delay to keep God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. No! he will of courſe make haſte to do it, leſt death and deſtruction ſhould ſuddenly overtake him: he will run, he will fly as upon the wings of the wind, or on the winged lightning, that he may eſcape the danger which hangs over his guilty head, and make his calling
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:008667_0093_102f74ee99591af0"/>
and election ſure. The man who ſees but an hand's or hair's-breadth, as it were, betwixt himſelf and eternal perdition, (as all wicked men who believe the ſcriptures would do, if they had a juſt ſenſe of the uncertainty of their lives) will ſurely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reaſon thus abſurdly in his heart:
<q>When I am ſome months or years ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; when I have finiſhed the worldly ſchemes I am now ſo deeply engaged in; when I have taken my fill of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual delights; when I have diſobeyed, affronted and diſhonored God, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging my luſts a while longer, then will I make all up with him by turning my feet unto his teſtimonies, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commandments; ſo that I ſhall ſecure my ſalvation effectually, without foregoing my preſent ſinful pleaſures. I can ſin with ſafety to myſelf for a while; and be wiſe, and pious, and virtuous, ſome time hence, when my life is drawing near to a period.</q>
How abſurd and ſenſeleſs would ſuch reaſoning be, if it could be called reaſoning? how unnatural in the mouth or heart of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who had any proper ſenſe of human frailty, the precariouſneſs of his life, and the conſequence of death to thoſe, whom it finds unprepared! Can you ſuppoſe it even poſſible for a man, duly ſenſible what
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:008667_0094_102fae6a5522c828"/>
his ſtate is, to have ſuch thoughts, and idle notions of future amendment, paſſing in his mind? No, ſurely: The language of a ſinner's heart, awakened into a juſt ſenſe of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of human life, and the conſequences of death, will be of a quite contrary ſtrain:
<q>I have far too often tranſgreſſed God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments already; I have riſqued my ſoul far too long. How fooliſh and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh have I been! O my God! what have I been doing! How have I been provoking thy juſt diſpleaſure! I am a monument of thy mercy, forbearance and long-ſuffering. I will no longer tempt thy vengeance, and hazard the loſs of my ſoul: I have done iniquity; I will do ſo no more. I will now, even while it is called to day, turn at thy reproof: I will make haſte, and not delay to keep thy commandments; leſt death ſurpriſe me unprepared to appear before thee! O my God, help me to put theſe my preſent reſolutions into practice; and preſerve me from that great and moſt dangerous folly of deferring my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to another day!</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS, or the like, will ever be the language of that man's heart, who truly believes the great doctrines of religion, who duly conſiders how much depends
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:008667_0095_102fae70e37ecac0"/>
upon turning his feet unto God's teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and how ſhort, how very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the time is, which is alotted him for that end. It is not ſuppoſeable that ſuch a man ſhould think of delaying a ſingle day to make his peace with God; to ſeek an intereſt in his favour, thrò him that came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt; and to ſecure himſelf againſt the terrible effects of his righteous diſpleaſure. You might as well ſuppoſe that a man would, with his eyes open, precipitate himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea, or leap headlong into the fire, as that ſuch a perſon would perſevere in the indulgence of thoſe luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition; or in perpetrating thoſe crimes, for which he knows he may ſuddenly be caſt into hell, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched!</p>
            <p>AND hence it plainly follows, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thoſe men may pretend, who go on from year to year in the gratification of their ſinful luſts and paſſions, they do not give a full and firm aſſent to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant doctrines of religion, more eſpecially thoſe reſpecting a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, or elſe they have not a juſt ſenſe of their frailty, the uncertainty of their lives, and the time of their proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Either they have ſome doubts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:008667_0096_102fae72c12ca8c0"/>
upon their minds, reſpecting the truth of what religion teaches concerning the perfections and moral government of God, and the conſequences of death to the righteous and wicked reſpectively; or, if they really and fully believe theſe things, they are not duly apprehenſive how ſhort and precarious their time here is, but moſt fondly and fooliſhly preſume upon that as certain, than which nothing is leſs ſo, viz. that they ſhall have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to repent and reform hereafter. One or the other of theſe muſt needs be the caſe: There is no poſſibility of account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their conduct, in delaying to turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies, in any other way, without contradicting the known principles of human nature, and the motives upon which men conſtantly act in all other matters of importance to them. The former ſuppoſition may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be the truth as to ſome wicked men, even amongſt the profeſſors of religion; and the latter as to others. Some, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, may not really believe thoſe great and fundamental articles of religion, which they profeſs; but profeſs them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for form and faſhion ſake, to avoid the appearance of ſingularity. It is eaſy to account for the conduct of ſuch. But there may be others who really believe
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:008667_0097_102fae749a84a2a0"/>
theſe doctrines, and are perſuaded in their own minds, that their eternal well-being depends upon turning to God, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commandments, during the preſent life; who have yet never once thought ſeriouſly and juſtly of the uncertainty of life; who have never learnt, with their other arithmetic, to number their days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; nor duly conſidered the hazard of delaying, on a preſumption that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of their lives is far diſtant.</p>
            <p>NOW whatever may be the reaſon why other perſons neglect to return to God, the more immediate cauſe why theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defer their repentance, is, becauſe they thus put far away the time of their death, and thus flatter themſelves with future opportunities of amendment. And you are ſenſible that my ſubject, and the main argument and deſign of this diſcourſe, lead me more particularly to guard you againſt this error, ſo natural, and almoſt neceſſary a cauſe, of ſecurity in ſin. It is probable that this is a very common, if not the moſt general and fatal deluſion, which people who believe the goſpel, fall into; and which keeps ſinners from turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their feet unto God's teſtimonies without delay. The devil is too know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tempt men to go on in their ſins with their eyes wide open, and while they
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:008667_0098_102fae76221aca08"/>
clearly diſcern the danger of it; he knows this would be to little purpoſe. The great adverſary of our ſouls, of whoſe devices we ſhould not be ignorant, therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes people into this notion, that their lives are not ſo very precarious as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; that they may, and probably will, live long; that they need not be in haſte; that there is no great danger of delaying a little longer, and enjoying the pleaſures of ſin: And that after they have indulged their luſts a few years more, then they may repent, and work out their ſalvation, and do it with double diligence.</p>
            <p>I CALL this a deluſion of the devil, not only becauſe all vain and falſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in general, which tend to make men quiet in their ſins, are aſcribed to him in ſcripture; but alſo becauſe it is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hardly poſſible that men ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded in this manner, and run into ſuch a groſs miſtake, unleſs they were under ſome ſtrange infatuation; unleſs, in ſhort, they were in fact blinded and bewitch'd by that evil ſpirit, that worketh in the children of diſobedience. For what ſinner could preſume thus upon future opportunities, and on that fooliſh preſumption make himſelf eaſy, and think his condition ſafe, were he not under the influence of ſome ſpirit even worſe than his own, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:008667_0099_102fafa99362d848"/>
him of his reaſon and ſenſes? Is there any foundation in nature, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, for ſuch preſumption? Is it not even contrary to common ſenſe; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what our lives are, their natural frailty, the numerous diſeaſes, and the many caſualties, if I may call them ſo, to which we are daily expoſed?</p>
            <p>LET me therefore endeavour to reſcue miſerable, mortal ſinners, out of the ſnare of the evil one, by impreſſing this plain, but uſeful ſentiment upon their hearts, that it may be written there as with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond, as their ſins are written in the book of God's remembrance; this ſentiment, I mean, that their lives are every moment uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. You can have no dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any future ſeaſon, if you neglect the preſent, for turning to God, and ſecuring that great ſalvation which is revealed in the goſpel. In the language of ſcripture, NOW is the accepted time, and NOW is the day of ſalvation. It is unreaſonable to allot upon that time which may never be yours, even in things of little moment: but to allot and rely upon it in a matter of infinite and eternal concernment, and when, if you ſhould happen to be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, you will be undone forever, this is ſuch ſottiſhneſs and infatuation as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:008667_0100_102f74faeb051b78"/>
be expreſſed in Words: Nor could any thing give an idea of it, ſufficiently ſtrong and affecting, unleſs perhaps it were, the groans, and fruitleſs lamentations of the damned, who have been already thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to their perdition! One would think that the word of God himſelf, wherein we are ſo frequently reminded of the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of our lives, and admoniſhed not to "boaſt ourſelves of to-morrow," might be ſufficient to reclaim us from this folly; and to make us conſtantly look upon ourſelves as dying men, even thô there were no other argument to convince us. But if, like Thomas, you muſt needs ſee before you will believe, and cry out,
<q>My Lord and my God!</q>
if you muſt needs ſee, in order to your being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, how frail and precarious human life is; come with me, let us look round the world; and then tell me what you ſee therein. I know you ſee that the old die: But tell me, do you not ſee that the young die alſo? Do you not ſee one dying there, who was juſt ſetting out in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the world, with a fair proſpect of making a figure in it? Do you not here ſee even children falling an early ſacrifice to death? And muſt you not from hence neceſſarily infer, that youth is no ſecurity at all againſt death, how much ſoever
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:008667_0101_102fae7c85d83740"/>
you may rely upon it? Do you not ſee, in the next place, that men of the greateſt capacity and learning die, as well as the fooliſh and bruitiſh perſon? and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that great parts, and acquired accompliſhments, are no ſecurity to you, thô poſſeſſed of them, and glorying in them? In the next place, do you not ſee, that the rich die, as well as the poor and neceſſitous? and conſequently, that great worldly poſſeſſions are no ſecurity, how apt ſoever you may be to think and ſay, you have much goods laid up for many years? Do you not alſo ſee, that the princes and potentates of the earth die, as well as men of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree? and conſequently, that worldly power and dominion are no ſecurity to the poſſeſſors of them? that thô they are gods, they are only mortal ones, and muſt die like common men? Do you not ſee, that the ſtrong and robuſt die, as well as the weak and infirm? and conſequently, that that which men are of all other things the moſt apt to rely upon, health and vigor of body, are no ſecurity? In fine, do you not plainly ſee, that perſons of all theſe different ranks and conditions of life, often die ſuddenly, without any conſiderable warning, unleſs it be that which they had not the wiſdom to take;
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:008667_0102_102fae7fd6b1e408"/>
I mean the common, viſible mortality of the ſpecies, and the deaths of others, of age, rank and circumſtances parallel to their own? You cannot deny, but that you plainly ſee all theſe things. And wilt thou then, O vain man, boaſt thyſelf of to-morrow? Wilt thou, contrary to the evidence of thy ſenſes, preſume upon the ſtability, and long continuance of thy life? Wilt thou, on this unreaſonable preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, excuſe thyſelf from making haſte to keep God's commandments? Wilt thou wage heaven, with all its unfading joys, that thy death is at a great diſtance? And wilt thou conſent to incur the pains and torments of the damned, if thou ſhouldſt be miſtaken, and it ſhould be nigh, even at the door! For this is really the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of thy delay, if thou delayeſt upon the preſumption I am now ſpeaking of; you do as it were bet your immortal ſouls, that thô you neglect to turn your feet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's teſtimonies at preſent, yet you ſhall not want an opportunity to do it hereafter. And what can be more irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional than to riſque ſo much upon ſo ſlender a probability? eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thô you ſhould not be miſtaken and diſappointed, yet you really gain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by this delay, but loſe the comforts and bleſſed hopes of a life devoted to God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:008667_0103_102fae81b8d368b8"/>WHAT do your reaſon and conſciences anſwer to theſe plain, but very ſerious and important queſtions? But indeed I need not aſk you what anſwer they make: for I know what it muſt of neceſſity be, if you underſtand the queſtions, and the ground of them. It muſt needs be, that it is the height of imprudence and madneſs to defer your repentance a day, or hour longer; that you will forfeit all juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to diſcrete and wiſe conduct, if you do not make haſte to keep God's commandments; ſince you have ſo great an intereſt that depends upon your doing it before this life, which is ſo very preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, is brought to a concluſion. It is impoſſible but that your underſtandings ſhould be convinced of theſe things; and God grant that your hearts may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to follow their dictates!</p>
            <p>THE argument which has been inſiſted upon in this diſcourſe, you are ſenſible, is drawn wholly from a conſideration of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of that ſpace which God allows us for repentance, and working out our ſalvation. If I ſhould live to preach, and you to hear, any more diſcourſes upon this ſubject, you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear ſome other arguments, tending to ſhow you the importance of acting the ſame part which the Pſalmiſt did, who
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:008667_0104_102fae8353e3ef28"/>
tells us that he made haſte, and delayed not to keep the commandments of God.</p>
            <p>TO conclude for the preſent; Let me beſeech you, as you value your ſouls, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider, and keep in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that argument which has now been improved to quicken you to your duty. Fix it in your thoughts, that this world is not your home; that you are ſtrangers and pilgrims in the earth, as all your fathers were; that you are haſtening to an eternal ſtate, a ſtate of righteous retribution; that you can have no dependence upon to-morrow; that you may be in another world before you hear another ſermon, yea before you get to your own houſes from the houſe of God, where the preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of life has been repreſented to you. However you may triumph in the thoughts of your youth, health or ſtrength, you have, believe it, all a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſtemper now upon you; you are in a conſumption; the ſeeds and the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death is within you; it cannot be long before, and it may be very ſoon that, you will go to the houſe appointed for all the living. Watch therefore, and endeavour to be prepared for your great change; for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein it will come upon you.
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:008667_0105_102fae8bc0686690"/>
Whenever it comes, you will be ſenſible, that as but one thing is needful, ſo that claims the firſt and laſt attention of man; and that all other cares, beſides that of the ſoul, are foreign from his true intereſt, and therefore little better than mere tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling. One might be confident, that a man who believes the ſcriptures, and has a due ſenſe of life's uncertainty, cannot go on from year to year, in the known, wilful violation of God's commandments, or delay to turn his feet unto his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. A man muſt almoſt forget that he is mortal, to be ſure forget that he is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour liable to death and its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, before he can be eaſy in his ſins. While he keeps death and eternal judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in view, and conſiders how ſoon and ſuddenly he may be called out of the world to receive his recompence, he will of courſe be conſtrained to live to God, who giveth unto all, life and breath and all things; and upon whom all intirely depend. So that there can hardly be a prayer more proper for mortal man to put up to the immortal, inviſible and eternal God, than that of the Pſalmiſt, with which I conclude; and which each one of us ſhould make with ſincerity and fervor, as he did, while we are muſing, and the fire burns;—

               <note place="margin">SERM IV.</note>THE reaſonableneſs and importance of making haſte to keep God's commandments, was ſhown in the laſt diſcourſe upon this ſubject, from
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:008667_0108_102fae91c9d5bef8"/>
a conſideration of the ſhortneſs of human life, and the uncertain duration of this probationary ſtate. It was then intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, that ſome other arguments would, by God's leave and aſſiſtance, be inſiſted upon, in order to quicken you in your return to him, and to ſhow you the unreaſonableneſs of delay in this matter. Accordingly I intend, in this diſcourſe, to handle another argument with the ſame general deſign of exciting you to a ſpeedy repentance, and reformation of your lives; thô the argument will be quite different in kind from the former.</p>
            <p>THE preſent argument, then, ſhall be drawn from a conſideration of the greater eaſe of reforming now, without delay, than there will be hereafter, if we put off this neceſſary and important work to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſeaſon, thô we were ſure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aving another, as we are not. Taking it for granted that you have as many years cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to come, as you may perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon, thô nothing is leſs certain; yet if by delaying your return to God, you will render ſtill more difficult, what ſeems ſo difficult and irkſome to you at preſent, it is plainly the dictate of wiſdom and prudence to make haſte, and not to defer it to another time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:008667_0109_102fae98754c97a0"/>WHEN any thing, be it what it will, is of great importance and neceſſity to be done by us ſome time or other, which will be attended with difficulty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much pains and labor, whenever it is done; and when delaying it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, or only probably, increaſe the difficulty, this is a plain reaſon why we ſhould immediately apply ourſelves to the doing of it, without the loſs of any time. There would be ſome plauſible excuſe, yea, in many caſes a ſufficient reaſon for delay, provided the particular buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us would grow eaſier and eaſier up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hands, the longer it was deferred; provided that which at preſent requires great pains and ſelf-denial, care and watchfulneſs, would require little or none ſome years hence. In many affairs of a worldly nature, thô not in all univerſally, this would fully juſtify a delay, and even make it the part of wiſdom. But where the reverſe of this is true; where the difficulty will be made greater by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination, it is evidently moſt reaſonable for us immediately to apply ourſelves to the work before us; that ſo we may ſave ourſelves that additional degree of toil, trouble and vexation, which will be the certain, or at leaſt probable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of delay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="unknown:008667_0110_102fae9a3064dae0"/>THE general rule or maxim here laid down, is indiſputably true, and univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged by men in their ſecular concernments. All men, excepting only the fooliſh, ſlothful and improvident, both acknowledge it true in ſpeculation, and act according to it, in their worldly affairs. Does not every man, who is but tolerably wiſe and prudent in the management of his affairs, ſtudy and contrive, and exert himſelf, to diſpatch them with all ſpeed, when it is either certain, or highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that delays will create new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and obſtructions to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſigns? when he knows that what is hard to be executed at preſent, will, in all likelihood, become ſtill the harder, the longer it is deferred? Do not all men of all ranks, profeſſions and ſtations in life, reaſon thus, and act upon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; except only the fooliſh, negligent and ſlothful, as was intimated before? Shew me, if you can, any of thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world, who can be called wiſe in their generation, or diſcrete in the conduct of their temporal affairs, who do not govern themſelves by this rule. You can ſhew me none, who do not. And ſhould not we, who are called to the kingdom and glory of God, be as careful, prudent and provident in the concerns of
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:008667_0111_102fae9c0d372dc0"/>
our ſouls, and eternal intereſt, as the men of the world generally are in their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concerns? Or rather, ſhould we not be more wary, more circumſpect, more diligent, more ſtudious to embrace the fitteſt opportunity for working out our ſalvation, than they are to compaſs their worldly deſigns and projects? Certainly we ſhould be ſo, by how more important and neceſſary this buſineſs is to us, than the former is to them. We ſhould take heed leſt, by any delay, we render this moſt neceſſary work of amending our hearts and manners, more difficult and irkſome than it would be, if we engaged in it immediately, as we ſhall doubtleſs do, if we delay it at all.</p>
            <p>BUT let me be a little more particular in ſtating and urging this argument for making haſte to keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. And here, allowing all that could be deſired, and indeed much more than is true, viz, that wicked men might depend upon many years to come, and be certain of a future ſeaſon for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, thò they neglect the preſent; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon this ſuppoſition, I ſay, it would be their wiſdom immediately to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the neceſſary work of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe deferring it will render it the more irkſome and difficult, and coſt
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:008667_0112_102fae9f1e82a370"/>
them the more pains in accompliſhing it at laſt. This argument conſiſts of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts following, which, for the ſake of clearneſs, it will be proper to conſider diſtinctly: viz.</p>
            <p>THAT for wicked men to reform their hearts and ways, and turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies, is a work of abſolute neceſſity to them:</p>
            <p>THAT it will be attended with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſelf-denial, how ſoon ſoever it is engaged in:</p>
            <p>THAT it will become ſtill more difficult by being delayed: And, therefore,</p>
            <p>THAT it highly concerns them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in it immediately; to make haſte, and not delay to keep God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.—Of each of theſe particulars in its order, as the time will allow.</p>
            <p>IT was obſerved then, as the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the preſent argument, and what is to be taken along with us thròout, That for wicked men to reform their hearts and ways, and turn their feet unto God's teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies, is a work of abſolute neceſſity to them. By which is meant, that they are intirely undone and loſt, if they do it not, and happy forever if they do it. There are many things, which a man may either do or forbear, without any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable advantage to him upon one hand,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:008667_0113_102faea3ed70dfa0"/>
or diſadvantage upon the other. But here, the gain and the loſs are both of them beyond compariſon or computation, being both infinite. This is a work which, if we perform it in the day of our viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will gain us the favour of almighty God, will inſure the ſalvation of our ſouls, and a glorious, incorruptible inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the kingdom of heaven; ſo that whatever elſe we may neglect, yet if we do this, we ſhall be happy forever, happy beyond all our preſent ideas and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. On the other hand, if we leave this undone, and die in our ſins, we ſhall incur the wrath of God, we ſhall loſe our ſouls, and have our portion with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his angels in outer darkneſs; ſo that whatever elſe we may do, yet if we neglect this, we ſhall be wretched forever, wretched beyond all that we can conceive of wretchedneſs at preſent. How ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a work then, muſt that be, upon the performance or neglect of which, ſo much depends! In our worldly affairs, we frequently think and ſpeak of this and the other thing as neceſſary, which are by no means ſo, the conſequences of doing or omitting them, not being very material to us one way or the other. But this is truly neceſſary; becauſe our great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal intereſt is inſeparably connected
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:008667_0114_102faea74b65b1b0"/>
with, and depends upon it. And indeed all that was ſaid in the two firſt diſcourſes upon this ſubject, concerning the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of turning our feet unto God's teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, is a proof of the great and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of this work, in the ſenſe of the term neceſſity, as here uſed: So that there is no occaſion for enlarging any farther here, upon this point.</p>
            <p>IT was obſerved in the next place, That this work will be attended with difficulty and ſelf-denial, how ſoon ſoever it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in. To correct the temper and manners, to break off a vicious courſe of life, and enter the paths of righteouſneſs, will at any time require great reſolution, and coſt t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> penitent much pains. Even before the fleſh, the world and the devil, have eſtabliſhed their empire over a man in its full ſtrength and power, it is no eaſy thing to conquer them, and throw off their oppreſſive yoke. There will be many a ſtruggle betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit; there muſt be many a conflict for the dominion over us, betwixt the world in which we live, and that world which faith diſcovers to us; there will be many a ſtrife and conteſt betwixt conſcience and the evil ſpirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience, before you will fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and eſtabliſh your moral liberty,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:008667_0115_102faea90c291150"/>
and get into a fixed habit of piety, and obedience to God's commandments. I would not therefore by any means flatter you with the thought, that you will not meet with difficulties, with many diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, with much hard labor, and have occaſion to exerciſe great ſelf-denial, 'ere you accompliſh a thorough reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in yourſelves, and become indeed the ſervants of God and righteouſneſs. This would be to ſpeak wickedly for God, and to deceive you to your hurt; whereas it is my duty to forewarn you truly of what you are to expect, that you may ſit down and count the coſt, and be the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to encounter the difficulties that may ariſe in your way. Theſe will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be ſo many and great, that you will often be ready to deſpond, thinking them unſurmountable; and that thô you ſhould ſtruggle for a while, yet you muſt finally be overcome, and fall by the hands of your ſpiritual enemies. This is what you are to expect, in turning your feet unto God's teſtimonies, how much haſte ſoever you may make to do it, and how reſolutely ſoever you may begin. You will find numerous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to overcome, which will require all your fortitude and ſtrength, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, will prove too hard for you.
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:008667_0116_102faeadb53ce418"/>
You will have ſnares laid in your way, ſo that you will ſometimes be ſurpriſed into ſin, and caught by the wiles of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, before you was aware of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular danger you was in. And it will coſt you many a groan in ſpirit, many a tear, before you can recover yourſelves out of the ſnare, and from under the power of the devil. Even the young, althô they may never have been remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably vicious, will be no ſtrangers to theſe diſcouragements and difficulties, when they ſet themſelves in earneſt to ſeek and ſerve their Creator. Nor is it proper that they ſhould be fed up, and deluded, with the contrary notions, that all will be eaſy and pleaſant to them at their firſt ſetting out in a life of religion, and obedience to God's commandments; which might be of very hurtful, if not fatal conſequence to them.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the ways of wiſdom are truly ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths peace, yet they are ſo only to thoſe who have fairly entered into them, and for ſome ſhort time at leaſt, been walking therein; who have gotten the maſtery of their luſts, and brôt their paſſions into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the laws of God and reaſon. In doing this, the difficulty lies; in getting into the right way; in thus ſubduing your
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:008667_0117_102faeb0962dbfe8"/>
luſts, and regulating your paſſions: And herein there ever was, and always will be, great difficulty, how much eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſoever there may be in the exerciſes of piety and virtue, after the habit of them is in ſome good meaſure gained. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of your hearts from the world, from all the luſts and vanities of it, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to God, in ſuch a manner as the goſpel makes indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation, will ordinarily cauſe pain and anguiſh, equal to that of cutting off a right hand, or plucking out a right eye; yea, it will be like rending the heart it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſunder; which may be one reaſon why repentance is expreſſed in ſcripture, by the metaphor of "a broken heart." It may be added, that it would not be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult, but altogether impracticable, for ſinners to ſubdue their luſts, to change their carnal minds, and ſerve God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, were it not for the grace and aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of his holy Spirit, thrô which all things are poſſible. Without him they can do nothing effectual to their ſalvation. But his word gives them reaſon to hope, and firmly to expect, that if they are not wanting to themſelves, he
<q>will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be tempted above that they are able; but will with the temptation make a way to eſcape, that they may
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:008667_0118_102faeb25a3ccfe8"/>
be able to bear it;</q>
and not labor in vain, or ſpend their ſtrength for nought.</p>
            <p>BUT however unable you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert yourſelves from the love of your luſts to the love of God; and altho' his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is exerted in the change of every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's heart, that is effectually changed; yet you are not to imagine that his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit operates herein in ſuch a manner, as to ſuperſede the neceſſity of the ſinner's labor and endeavours, or to exempt him from all pain and toil and trouble, in turning to God. We may indeed ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it poſſible for God to turn a ſinner to himſelf, without any pain, or difficulty, or labor to the ſinner. But it is certain that this is not the way, in which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually works upon the hearts of wicked men in their converſion. His almighty power is not exerted in ſuch a manner as leaves them no work to do, no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and difficulties to ſtruggle with, no ſelf-denial to practiſe. For all who have ever been truly converted from their ſins to God, have actually found theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their way, and found by their own experience the neceſſity of exerting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the utmoſt, in order to ſurmount them. And all theories and ſpeculations, ſchemes and notions, whether reſpecting things natural or things ſpiritual, muſt
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:008667_0119_102faeb5d3550538"/>
certainly give way to what is plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact and experience, if there is any diſagreement betwixt them.</p>
            <p>LET every ſinner therefore, whether old or young, remember theſe two things, of great importance to be kept in mind by him; That without grace and help from above, he cannot effectually change his own heart, ſo as to be made fit for the kingdom of heaven: And, That he muſt co-operate with the good Spirit of God in turning to him. He muſt not imagine that God will give him his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in ſuch manner and meaſure, as will leave him no work to do, no trials and conflicts to go thrô, no temptations and difficulties to vanquiſh. He muſt learn to endure toil and hardſhip, if he hopes to become a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt; he muſt exert himſelf with diligence, prayer and watchfulneſs. This is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon one hand, as it is upon the other, that all his pains and labor would be ineffectual, without the bleſſing of God upon them. Wicked men are required in the holy ſcriptures, not only to "ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate," which our Saviour ſays was found but of few, at leaſt in that age and country wherein he lived; but they are even required to
<q>make them a new heart, and a new ſpirit.</q>

And indeed, were not this true, as well as that the grace and aſſiſtance of God's Spirit are neceſſary to that end, a great part of the ſcriptures muſt either have no meaning at all, or elſe naturally convey a ſenſe which is repugnant to truth: To ſuppoſe either of which, would be highly derogatory to them, and blaſphemy againſt the Spirit that inſpired them.</p>
            <p>BUT not to digreſs any farther from the particular point before us. It is moſt certain that all ſinners, even the young not excepted, will find many trials and difficulties, whenever they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the working out their ſalvation; much labour and pains will be requiſite, and great ſelf-denial, till ſuch time as they have made ſome conſiderable attainments in religion. However, this ſhould by no means diſcourage or deter any from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting a reformation of themſelves, with God's aſſiſtance, which will not be denied to them that ſeek it aright. Whatever dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties may attend this work, yet, as was obſerved to you above, it is a work of abſolute, indiſpenſible neceſſity to you: You muſt either turn your feet unto God's
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:008667_0121_102faec010600440"/>
teſtimonies and keep his commandments, or elſe be condemned as the tranſgreſſors of them, in the judgment of the great day. There is no medium betwixt turning and dying, according to the expreſſion in the Prophet,
<q>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael!</q>
It may be hard and irkſome to you to forſake your ſins; but will it not be much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and more irkſome, to undergo the penalty or puniſhment of them in hell! Now as this work of reformation is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary in order to your ſalvation, ſo the ſooner you engage heartily in it, the better it will be for your ſelves. For, as it was obſerved above,</p>
            <p>IT will become ſtill more difficult by being delayed. The longer it is put off, the more grief, pain and trouble it will coſt the ſinner, whenever he turns his feet unto God's teſtimonies. This aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is grounded chiefly, tho' not intirely, upon the common, well-known maxim, that vicious habits in general are ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by time, 'til they are rooted out and deſtroyed by the efficacy of religion, and the grace of God: A maxim, as certainly true, agreeable to experience, and to the doctrine of ſcripture, as it is common in the mouths of men. The longer any have been ſinning againſt God, the more
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:008667_0122_102faec1b10675f8"/>
hardened they are of courſe againſt the fear of him, and the farther do they go aſtray from him in the by-paths of folly and wickedneſs; and the harder it will conſequently be for them to correct their tempers, to reform their lives, to turn their feet unto his teſtimonies, and walk in his righteous ways. Wicked men groſly deceive themſelves, or are deluded by the devil, if they imagine, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that the power of ſin and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them will decay merely by length of time, without their oppoſing it; and that if they delay to keep God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments for a ſeaſon, they ſhall find repentance and reformation an eaſier work, than it would be at preſent. The reverſe of this is moſt certainly the truth. And yet it is highly probable, that many wicked men, unwilling to part with their ſins at preſent, for the love they bear to them, ſecretly flatter themſelves that this will be the caſe; and upon ſuch a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuppoſition, and fond preſumption, indulge their luſts year after year, 'til they are grown old in iniquity. They ſeem to imagine, if I may ſo expreſs it, that they can ſin away their ſins, if they take time for it; and that the corrupt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their hearts may run it ſelf dry, and be quite exhauſted, by the plentiful
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:008667_0123_102faec4043c9840"/>
ſtreams flowing from it in a ſucceſſion of years! But alas! that impure fountain within them, from whence proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, deceits, and other immoralities, is not thus to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted. It is plentifully ſupplied, and will be kept full, how great rivers and floods of iniquity ſoever are conſtantly pouring from it. Yea, if pains be not ſeaſonably taken to cut off its latent, ſecret ſources, it will riſe higher and higher, 'til it exceeds all banks and bounds; ſo that it will be next to impoſſible to reduce and confine it, or prevent its drowning the ſinner in deſtruction and perdition. If it would be difficult for you to bridle and reſtrain your luſts now, how will you conquer them when they are grown far more violent and head-ſtrong? The words of the prophet, thô perhaps ſpoken with another view, may yet be accommodated to the point in hand:
<q>If thou haſt run with footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canſt thou contend with horſes? and if in the land of peace wherein thou truſtedſt, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the ſwelling of Jordan<note n="c" place="margin">Jer. XII.5.</note>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>SIN is not only a cruel and deſtructive, but a falſe and treacherous enemy: and thrô this deceitfulneſs, the heart is inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:008667_0124_102faec751a43c40"/>
more and more hardened. This mortal foe comes to men under the enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, ſyren form of pleaſure, binding them without reſiſtance in her ſoft and ſilken bands, which they imagine they can break and caſt off whenever they pleaſe. But, alas! they ſoon become ſtronger than all Delilah's green withs and cords, ſo that a Sampſon could not break them in ſunder, without the aſſiſtance of One, greater than the "ſtrong man armed." We do not only read in ſcripture, that wicked men ſhall wax worſe and worſe; (which is equally true of ſeducers, and the ſeduced, led away with divers luſts) but we are frequently warned concerning the danger of ſtrong, inveterate habits of ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by uſe and cuſtom; and the great difficulty of overcoming them. Yea, it is ſometimes repreſented as being almoſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally impoſſible, as well as morally ſo, for men who have long indulged their luſts, to get the victory over them.
<q>Can the Aethiopian change his ſkin, or the leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.<note n="d" place="margin">Jer. XI.23.</note>?</q>
Theſe words of the prophet, to ſay the leaſt, plainly imply, that the longer men ſin, and give the reins to their ungodly luſts and paſſions, the leſs inclination, and the leſs moral power, (if there be any
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:008667_0125_102faecc2faf3ac8"/>
real difference betwixt theſe things) they will ordinarily have to forſake their evil ways, and to keep God's commandments. Their love to ſin, and their averſion to holineſs, will generally be ſtrong in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the length of time they have been alienated from God, and the degree to which they have indulged their luſts: Which being the caſe, renders their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, humanly ſpeaking, ſo much the more difficult and improbable.</p>
            <p>IT is not indeed to be denied, that a perſon's inclination to ſome particular ſins may be naturally leſſened by time, age and experience; I mean, leſſened of courſe, without any efforts or endeavours of the perſon himſelf to amend his ways. But then his inclination to other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſins will naturally and of courſe be ſtrengthened, in the ſame, if not in a greater proportion. Man is not alike diſpoſed to the ſame ſins at all periods of his life; but has, like the year, various ſeaſons, which produce a variety of fruits. You ſee in the natural world, I mean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this earth, now under the malediction of heaven, that there are certain poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weeds, and evil fruits, proper, and almoſt peculiar, to every month, from the firſt opening of the ſpring to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of winter. There is a ſucceſſion
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:008667_0126_102faecf7448a4c0"/>
of them, even upon the ſame ſoil; one dies, in appearance, ſtill leaving its root alive in the earth, and another ſprings up and flouriſhes in its ſtead. Thus it is with mankind and their vices: The carnal heart of man is a ſoil, fruitful of evil; ſo that even in the early ſpring of life, you will often ſee many corrupt fruits produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from it. For, in the language of ſcripture,
<q>the wicked are eſtranged from the womb: they go aſtray as ſoon as they are born ſpeaking lies.</q>
And althô ſome of theſe evil weeds, theſe follies and vices of childhood, ſeem to die away of themſelves, yet the root of bitterneſs is ſtill alive: And unleſs religion, a virtuous education, and the grace of God prevent, theſe vices will be followed by others, proper to youth; theſe by others, proper to manly, mature life; and theſe ſtill by others, more natural to old age. So that in every ſeaſon of life, even from its ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bloom to the winter of age, you will ſee a large crop of vices, but too naturally growing and flouriſhing upon this bad ground. Thô the leaves fall off, and the branches wither away, at certain times, the poiſonous root of all is ſtill green, ſtrong and vigorous in the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains like the root of the emblematic tree, which Nebuchadnezzar<note n="e" place="margin">Dan. IV.</note> ſaw in his viſion,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:008667_0127_102faed12cc4ec18"/>
with a band of iron and braſs in the earth, even after the leaves are ſhaken off, the branches lopped, and the tree it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hewèd down: An intimation that his kingdom remained ſure to him; and that after his ſeeming ruin, he ſhould riſe to greater glory and majeſty than ever. Thus does ſin ſtill live and reign in the hearts of the wicked, 'til the
<q>axe is laid to the root of the tree;</q>
thô ſome particular vices may appear to die away with time. Others, and more enormous ones, will probably ſucceed to theſe, whoſe tops will reach to the very heavens: And the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of ſin is not only ſure and certain, but enlarged continually; and, if I may ſo expreſs it, a more
<q>excellent majeſty is given to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is indubitably certain, that 'til a man ſets about reforming his heart and ways in earneſt, he will really grow worſe and worſe, whether he is ſenſible of it or not himſelf; and thô it may ſeem to himſelf and others, that he has forſaken divers of his youthful follies and vices; yea, thô it may be true, he does not actually live in the outward practice of them. He may perhaps flatter himſelf that he ſhall drop all the reſt by degrees, without taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pains to get rid of them, as the adder drops his ſkin. However, the ſerpent
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:008667_0128_102faed2b496ff58"/>
ſtill remains a ſerpent in nature; he is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly growing an older and more venomous one; and a new ſkin will as naturally ſucceed, as the other fell off. And in like manner, 'til the ſinner actually returns to God by unfeigned repentance, he grows more and more a ſinner: He does at beſt, only exchange his old vices for new ones, and thoſe probably greater. The poiſon of aſps is ſtill under his tongue, and in his heart, which will vent itſelf in ſome way or other: And all the time, while the deluded wretch fancies his vices are leaving him, he is growing into a nearer reſemblance of that
<q>old ſerpent, called the devil and ſatan, which deceiveth the whole world.</q>
The natural principle of conſcience will be inſenſibly weakened in him; his heart will grow more callous and unfeeling; his power of ſelf-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will gradually be loſt; and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of ſin in general will be the more firmly eſtabliſhed in his ſoul, the longer it is ſubmitted to, and indulged: So that a reformation will become much more difficult than it would otherwiſe have been. According to the eſtabliſhed order of things, and the method of God's deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us, in our ſpiritual concernments, it is paſt doubt, that we may much eaſier turn our feet unto his teſtimonies, ſoon
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:008667_0129_102faed61c484ba0"/>
after deviating from them, and before we have gone far in the ways of error and vice, than when long, cuſtomary ſinning, has render'd vice our ſecond nature. For, as has been intimated before, it is abſurd in this caſe to talk of what God can do by his almighty power, and how eaſily he can convert the moſt obdurate ſinner to himſelf, even without giving the ſinner any pain, trouble or difficulty. However poſſible this may be, yet ſurely there is not the leaſt ground to hope, that he will in fact do thus. No, verily: They who enter into life at all, muſt ſtrive and labor to do it; exerting themſelves with all diligence to work out their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while God by his providence, word and Spirit, is drawing them, and working in them to will and to do of his good pleaſure. And the ſooner they ſet about this neceſſary work, the leſs ſorrow will they give themſelves.</p>
            <p>HAVING therefore eſtabliſh'd theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the concluſion cannot be denied. It ſtands thus: Since repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation are abſolutely neceſſary to our ſalvation; ſince this work is painful and difficult whenever it is engaged in; and ſince it will certainly become more ſo by being delayed; the moſt wiſe and prudent courſe is, to make haſte, and immediately
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:008667_0130_102faedce2f64d58"/>
to apply ourſelves to it. It is folly to put it off another day or hour. You ſhould even now reſolve to amend your ways; your hearts ſhould even now be lifted up to God in the heavens, in the exerciſe of humble repentance for what is already paſt; in prayer for the pardon of it, and that he would grant you thoſe aſſiſtances of his bleſſed Spirit, which are needful in order to your forſaking your ſins, and keeping his holy commandments for the future.</p>
            <p>SOME may perhaps ſay in their hearts, that this is hard doctrine.
<q>May I not indulge my favourite luſt a little longer? Muſt I now, thô in the bloom and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of life, mortify my members which are upon the earth? Muſt I now take my heart from the world, on which I have beſtowed it, and give it to God? How can I endure the thought of ſo ſudden and ſpeedy a change! Let me walk in the way of my heart, and in the ſight of my eyes, but a few years longer; and then will I, without reluctance, turn at God's reproof, and devote myſelf to his ſervice!</q>
But, O child of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, guilt and folly! I tell thee, and know thou it for thy good, that thô thou ſhouldſt live a few years longer, as thou preſumeſt, yet by perſiſting thus in thy
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:008667_0131_102faede6925e7b0"/>
evil courſes for the preſent, thou art mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard and bitter work for thyſelf. Thou art making that which thou now thinkeſt ſo irkſome and difficult, far more ſo. For every wilful ſin thou committeſt after this time, thou wilt pay an additional groan, whenever thou repenteſt of thy ſins in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: For every commandment thou breakeſt after this, one of thy heart-ſtrings will be broken, whenever thou comeſt ſeriouſly to think on thy ways, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them: For every criminal indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, thô attended with preſent pleaſure, thou wilt undergo pangs of diſtreſs and anguiſh, another day: And whenever thou buryeſt thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollies and vices, thou wilt weep over them as it were tears of blood; not that they are dead, but that they lived ſo long; and that thou waſt ſo fooliſh as to nouriſh them up from dwarfs, 'til they became as giants, that warred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heaven, and thy own ſoul, ſo long. Thou art at leaſt treaſuring up unto thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſorrow in this world, againſt the day of ſorrow, I mean, of repentance; if not wrath, againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God. Wilt thou not then be perſwaded to make haſte? Wilt thou ſtill delay to keep God's commandments? Wilt thou be willing to pay in tears and groans another
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:008667_0132_102faedff01714b8"/>
day, for thy preſent criminal indulgences? Wilt thou make that which now ſeems ſo difficult to thee, abundantly more difficult, by procraſtination? Wilt thou now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately chooſe and act that part, which thou muſt ſo bitterly repent of hereafter? Or canſt thou think it conſiſtent with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence, to do that now, for which thou wilt, ſome time or other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thyſelf as a fool? yea, for which thou mayeſt perhaps be condemned of God, when ſighs, and groans, and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, will be of no ſervice to thee!</p>
            <p>TO draw to a concluſion; let me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeech every impenitent ſinner preſent, ſeriouſly to conſider what has been ſaid, reſpecting the greater difficulty he will find hereafter in reforming his ways, if God peradventure ſhould give him an opportunity for it, than he would find at preſent. It is certain from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and both reaſon and experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, that vice and wickedneſs long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, become more hard to be ſubdued; that thò the external exertions and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations thereof in the lives and actions of men, ſhould not be multiplied, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſignal and obſervable, yet the habit and dominion of ſin in the heart will be ſtrengthened; and the moral fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſoul, becoming more diſtorted
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:008667_0133_102faee4a4718f30"/>
and monſtrous, be the harder to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to the image and likeneſs of God. This argument for making haſte, is of great weight; and ſhews, of itſelf, the great folly and imprudence of delaying your repentance. And as this is the only argument which I propoſed to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at this time, I will not now urge the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of human life; nor any other Conſiderations to quicken you; though there are many ſuch, and ſome, which are naturally ſuggeſted by the late diſpenſations, and the preſent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, of divine providence. All theſe I wave for the preſent; only requeſting you to conſult your own eaſe; and by making haſte to keep God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prevent that additional ſorrow and trouble to yourſelves, which delay will certainly bring with it, even though it ſhould not prove fatal and remedileſs!</p>

            <p>THE reaſonableneſs and importance of making haſte to keep God's commandments,<note place="margin">SERM V.</note> was the ſubject of the two laſt diſcourſes, and is likewiſe to be the ſubject of the preſent. Two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments have been already inſiſted on, for the illuſtration and proof of this point.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:008667_0135_102faeebd0f0cea8"/>
The former of them was drawn from a conſideration of the ſhortneſs of human life, and the uncertain duration of this probationary ſtate: The latter of them, from a conſideration of the greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty attending a reformation, if defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till the habits of ſin are confirmed and ſtrengthened. I propoſe, in this diſcourſe, to urge another argument with the ſame general deſign of exciting thoſe who have gone aſtray from God, and his holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, to be ſpeedy in their return to him, and living ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world.</p>
            <p>THIS third argument ſhall be drawn from a conſideration of the ſuperior hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs attending a religious and virtuous life, compared with a life of ſin, and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation from God, the fountain of living waters. It is certainly a thing, very reaſonable in itſelf, and of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to men, to make haſte to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: I mean, to obtain the greateſt and nobleſt happineſs, of which they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in this world. No one, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, will deny the reaſonableneſs of this, or its importance to us: For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of happineſs is both a natural and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional one; no ways criminal in itſelf, however criminal moſt of the ways are, in which mankind ſeek felicity; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:008667_0136_102faeeede978b00"/>
conformable to the will of God, and the great end of our being. Now if it be reaſonable, and a thing of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to us, to make haſte to be happy, it is equally reaſonable, and of equal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to us, to make haſte in turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies: Or if it be irrational and fooliſh to delay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of that happineſs, for which we were made, and which is within our reach, it is equally irrational and fooliſh for us to delay our return to God, and keeping his commandments. For there is no peace, no felicity, no joy in this world, comparable to that, which attends a life devoted to God, ſpent in his ſervice, and in communion with him: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hopes for any happineſs here, worthy the purſuit of a reaſonable and immortal creature, while he is wandering from his God, and violating his laws, is as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived, and will as ſurely be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as God and his word are true.</p>
            <p>DOUBTLESS a very common, and one of the moſt fatal offences, which wicked men take at practical religion, and which makes them ſo backward to reform their lives, has its riſe in an ill-grounded ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that religion is a gloomy, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly buſineſs, a foe to human felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that it multiplies our pains, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges

               </gap>at it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed men muſt, as it were, bid a final adieu to all joy and comfort in this world, when, by turning their feet unto God's teſtimonies, they endeavour to ſecure his favor, and provide for their eternal well-being in another. Nor indeed can it be denied, that ſome injudicious, tho' perhaps very good men, have expreſſed themſelves ſo incautiouſly concerning the ſelf-denial, and mortifications of a religious life, as very much to ſtrengthen this vulgar, and too natural prejudice of vicious men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the right ways of the Lord. And it muſt be confeſſed, that were religion ſo great an enemy to men's happineſs in this world, as is often ſuppoſed, it would not be altogether ſtrange, that ſinners are ſo apt to delay their reformation, as they are. This, if true, muſt needs be looked upon as a very great, tho' by no means a ſufficient objection, againſt a man's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the courſe of his life, and making haſte to keep God's commandments: For who is forward to do that, which he knows will render his life more unhappy upon the whole, than it would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be? My deſign therefore, by divine aſſiſtance, is, to ſhow how groundleſs a prejudice this is; to make it evident to
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:008667_0138_102faef701d23b78"/>
you, by reaſon and ſcripture, that a life conducted by the principles of religion, is the happieſt you can poſſibly live on earth: And ſo, from hence to argue the reaſonableneſs and importance of making haſte to keep God's commandments, and live this bleſſed life.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, it muſt juſt be premiſed, that when I ſpeak of the happineſs, and ſuperior pleaſures attending a life of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and virtue; I do not mean, that it is thus happy when a man firſt enters upon it. The beginning of a reformation is always attended with a degree of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, pain and uneaſineſs; ſo that a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man will not, perhaps, immediately find that he is any gainer by changing his courſe and manner of life. But time and experience will convince every true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, that in turning his feet unto God's teſtimonies, he provided the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for his own peace and comfort in this world, as well as for his happineſs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nor will he want any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, than what ariſes from his own perception, and daily experience, that
<q>the ways of wiſdom are, indeed, ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths peace.</q>

            <p>THE main argument of the preſent diſcourſe, may be handled under the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervations, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:008667_0139_102faef8b17583a8"/>THAT religion being a reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, enjoined upon us by our wiſe and good Creator, it muſt therefore of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be ſuppoſed conducive to human happineſs, even in this preſent ſtate; the contrary ſuppoſition implying in it a groſs abſurdity:</p>
            <p>THAT a life of irreligion and vice is naturally productive of many evils and diſquietudes, from which the contrary courſe of life is free:</p>
            <p>THAT religion is ſo far from abridging us of the natural pleaſures of life, which are worthy of our purſuit, that it refines and exalts them all:</p>
            <p>THAT it affords the beſt relief, and moſt rational ſupport, under thoſe afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and trials which are common to men, in this preſent evil world: And,</p>
            <p>THAT the practice and hopes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are attended with noble and divine pleaſures, which good men only enjoy, and a ſtranger intermeddleth not with.</p>
            <p>FROM which reflections laid together, it will plainly appear in the concluſion, of how great importance it is to wicked men to make haſte, and what injury they do themſelves by delaying, to keep God's commandments.—Of each of theſe particulars in its order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:008667_0140_102faefa39c54e80"/>IT was obſerved then, in the firſt place, That religion being a reaſonable ſervice, enjoined upon us by our wiſe and good Creator, it muſt therefore of neceſſity be ſuppoſed conducive to human happineſs, even in this preſent ſtate; the contrary ſuppoſition implying in it a groſs abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I am not now diſputing with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed unbelievers; either with thoſe who ſay in their hearts, there is no God, or with thoſe who deny the truth and divine authority of the holy ſcriptures. It is taken for granted that you believe in God; and are perſwaded that, having at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpoken to the fathers by the prophets, he has in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things; that the chriſtian religion is a reaſonable one, and comes from God; and requires of men nothing but what is fit for men to do. Aſk your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeriouſly then, whether it is poſſible that the practice of this reaſonable religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, enjoined upon you by God all-wiſe and good, ſhould tend to make you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, even in this world? and whether you can expect to find more felicity in violating the laws of it, than in carefully obſerving them? Can there be ſuch a contradiction in nature, as this would
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:008667_0141_102faf008419f510"/>
ſuppoſe? Can reaſon and happineſs be thus at variance? Or can folly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable conduct, promote the well-being of reaſonable creatures in any ſtate, or period of their exiſtence? Can you ſuppoſe that God, our merciful Father, would require that of us, which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tends to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>roy the peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our lives? Can it enter into your hearts to imagine, that he enjoins you to love him, and keep his commandments leſt you ſhould enjoy more happineſs in walking contrary to him, than in doing ſo? What wiſe and good prince gives any laws to his ſubjects, beſides thoſe which are conducive to their well-being? And if God's commandments were ſuch, that men might be happier in diſobeying, than yielding obedience to them, would this be reconcileable with that character of wiſdom and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence which we aſcribe to him? Would it not from hence follow, that he was an unreaſonable and envious being, who aimed rather at vexing and grieving his creatures by arbitrary impoſitions, than at their proſperity, by giving them whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome laws? And would it not follow as the plain conſequence of theſe premiſes, that the world, inſtead of being under the government of ſuch an all-wiſe and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:008667_0142_102faf041040eb50"/>
ſovereign as is commonly ſuppoſed, is really governed by a tyrannical maſter, regardleſs of its welfare, or rather an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to it?</p>
            <p>I KNOW not exactly in what light theſe reflections may appear to others, whether juſt or not. But to me it appears with all the certainty of a ſelf-evident propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a life of reaſon muſt needs be a life of happineſs; and that as far as men walk contrary to reaſon, they run into miſery: So that if the laws of God are reaſonable laws, we muſt needs be gainers, even at preſent, by obſerving them. It is plain to a demonſtration, that if the world is under the government of a perfectly wiſe and good being, as we all ſuppoſe, the courſe of life which he has pointed out for us, partly by that internal ſenſe and conſciouſneſs of moral obligations which he has given us, and more fully by an external revelation, muſt needs be the moſt happy courſe of life that man can lead; ſuitable to his nature, and in all reſpects beſt for him. From which conſideration alone, it is evident to all that will attend to it, that to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in diſobeying God's commandments, is, in effect, perſevering to be miſerable; or depriving ourſelves of that felicity which was deſigned for us, and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:008667_0143_102faf05cc666870"/>
our reach. If we imagine that God's precepts, and our own reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, concur in leading us aſide from our true happineſs, we muſt ſuppoſe, there is a grand, fundamental error in the very nature, and original conſtitution of things; that we are a contradiction to ourſelves; that reaſon requires us to make ourſelves miſerable; that there is no wiſe and good moral government eſtabliſhed in the univerſe; but only a cruel tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. On the other hand, all will be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, conſiſtent and beautiful, if we ſuppoſe, that that religious and virtuous courſe of life, which God has preſcribed to us, and which correſponds to the law written in our hearts, is the way of happineſs and peace; that whenever we deviace therefrom, we wander in the ſame degree, from that felicity which we were made for, like fooliſh prodigals, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking their father's houſe, where they have bread enough, and to ſpare, and periſhing with hunger in a ſtrange land: And that 'til we ariſe, and go to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we are ſtrangers to true happineſs; we are, in effect, only endeavouring to ſatisfy ourſelves with the
<q>huſks which the ſwine do eat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT leaving theſe general reflections, which ſurely are not without their weight,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:008667_0144_102faf08e50b7d70"/>
let us deſcend to fact and experience. And it will appear, as it was obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, that a life of irreligion and vice is naturally productive of many evils and diſquietudes, from which the contrary courſe of life is free. It is undeniable, that a diſturbed mind and uneaſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are the common, and natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a wicked life. Some men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hardened to a great degree in vice; but, probably, never to ſo great a degree, that they are kept in perfect peace in their own breaſts. Generally it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with wicked men. The conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their crimes, and ill deſert, joined with an apprehenſion of God's righteous diſpleaſure, gives them great uneaſineſs, however they may try to drown the voice of conſcience. They are far from being ſatisfied with themſelves, in their evil cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whatever they may pretend. A rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature cannot be at quiet in his own mind, while he knows he is acting an unreaſonable part; that his Maker is diſpleaſed with him, and that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expoſed to the fatal conſequences of that diſpleaſure. A ſenſe of guilt, and ſecret apprehenſion of danger, will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily lie as a heavy weight and burthen upon his mind; and, even in the midſt of laughter, make his heart ſorrowful.
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:008667_0145_102faf0bd3143b48"/>
The mind of man is the chief, and, philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophically ſpeaking, perhaps the only ſeat, both of pleaſure and pain: And if that is diſquieted within him, by any means, eſpecially by a conſciouſneſs of his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violating his duty to God and his neighbour, and abuſing his intellectual powers, it is impoſſible he ſhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the poſſeſſion of any external goods, tho' he has more than heart could wiſh. This internal ſource of diſquietude will remain, while a man remains wicked and impenitent, tho' all things without ſhould conſpire to make him happy. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect therefore it is evident, that a pious, good man, has greatly the advantage of the ſinner and profligate; the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from that remorſe, and thoſe guilty fears, which always attend the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſome degree, and generally make life uncomfortable to him.</p>
            <p>BUT there are alſo many external evils which are the natural fruit of an irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, profligate life, from which evils good men are exempted. What a numerous train of woes does a libertine courſe of behaviour lead after it, in addition to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e which are common to men?
<q>Who hath woes? Who hath ſorrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath wounds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe?</q>
Is it they who are ſober
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:008667_0146_102faf1082e9f4d8"/>
and temperate in all things? Or they who "tarry long at the wine; they that go to ſeek mixt wine?" Who are the moſt ſubject to bodily pains and diſeaſes? They who keep under their body, and bring it into ſubjection to the laws of reaſon and religion? Or they, whoſe paſſions and appetites are without reſtraint and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul? Do not the libertine part of the world generally pay dearly for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and debaucheries, in thoſe pains and bodily diſorders, which are the natural conſequence of them? Yea, do not many bring a premature old age upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and die before their time, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus "wicked overmuch?" Whether we conſider the hiſtory of times paſt, or look round the world at preſent, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the nature of the thing itſelf, we cannot be inſenſible that vicious men do, and muſt, bring many external, bodily evils on themſelves, which they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void by a contrary behaviour, and which good men are actually free from.</p>
            <p>IT may be added here, that as human laws are
<q>not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for the ungodly and for ſinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers, — for whoremongers,— for perjured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</q>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.9.</note> &amp;c.; ſo ſuch lawleſs men, and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:008667_0147_102faf1246771720"/>
not the righteous, ſuffer by them, in the ordinary courſe of things. Civil ſociety will not permit men to go on with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in violating the laws of virtue and righteouſneſs; but is obliged, for its own ſecurity and ſupport, to puniſh them in a variety of ways. And how frequent are the examples of this ſort, even in times and places wherein religion and virtue are at a low ebb in general? Such is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſociety, and the laws by which it ſubſiſts throughout the world, that aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned wickedneſs and vice muſt needs be ſubjected to many inconveniencies, and even heavy penalties, from which virtue is ordinarily free.
<q>For who is he that will harm you, ſays the apoſtle, if ye be followers of that which is good?</q>
            </p>
            <p>FROM theſe conſiderations it appears, that the preſent conſtitution and courſe of things, is moral in a high degree, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the general depravity of the world. Such is human nature, ſuch the natural effects of vice, and ſuch the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſociety, that vice is evidently the parent of miſery and evil, mental, bodily, and penal. Men are uſually, tho' not univerſally, made to ſuffer evil even now, in ſome proportion to the nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their crimes. No one can habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually act contrary to the fundamental
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:008667_0148_102faf183af039f0"/>
laws of religion, righteouſneſs and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, without hurting himſelf, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his life much more uncomfortable than it would be, if directed by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of piety and virtue. And this being the caſe, ſurely wicked men ſhould, for their own ſakes, make haſte, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to keep God's commandments. By this means they would deliver themſelves from many diſtreſſing fears, and poſitive evils, which are incident to a vicious life: So that the calm conſideration of their own preſent intereſt, could not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, when they think of their ways, to imitate the example of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>BUT for the farther illuſtration of this point, it was obſerved above, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the prejudices which men often entertain againſt religion; it is ſo far from abridging us of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pleaſures of life, which are worthy of our purſuit, that it refines and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts them all. You cannot think of any ſort of worldly happineſs or enjoyment, forbidden you by the laws of God, to which you would not be aſhamed to own before a wiſe man, that you had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; or that your own reaſon would not condemn you for coveting and purſuing, even tho' God had explicitly
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:008667_0149_102faf19c663aa78"/>
laid you under no prohibition reſpecting it. For example; would you not be aſhamed to acknowledge before a wiſe man, that you took a pleaſure in intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, or making beaſts of yourſelves, by drunkenneſs? Or that any part of your happineſs was placed in gluttony? Would you be willing it ſhould be even ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that you had any pleaſure in theſe things, or in them that do them, tho' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed religion was out of the caſe? Would you not be aſhamed to own, that you deſired to enrich yourſelves by inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your neighbour? by ſtealing, cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any of the various kinds of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty? Would you not think it a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, even tho' it were no ſin, to be tho't capable of taking delight in practices ſo unreaſonable, and unworthy of a man? Would you not be aſhamed to be thought perſons of unbridled luſt, and given to lawleſs leudneſs? ſuch as could not be happy without breaking thro' thoſe rules and ties, on the obſervation of which the well-being of ſociety ſo much depends; and which being diſregarded, no one could have the ſatisfaction of knowing, either his own father, or his own offspring? Would you not be aſhamed to own, tho' you were under no apprehenſion of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment, that you took pleaſure
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:008667_0150_102faf1ce88a95f8"/>
in a practice ſo irrational, as that of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the holy name of God, or profanely curſing, either your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or yourſelves? You cannot, in ſhort, think of any ſpecies of pleaſure or enjoyment, forbidden by religion, which your own reaſon could juſtify, or which yourſelves could think worthy of your purſuit, tho' religion laid you under no reſtraints with reſpect to it. The world is all before you, given by our bountiful Creator to the children of men, with the things of it, for their uſe and enjoyment. You are laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no reſtrictions or limitations, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch as you muſt acknowledge to be fit and reaſonable, and even neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in order to the well-being of ſociety; and which being tranſgreſſed by a man, he muſt acknowledge, he acts below the dignity of his rational nature.</p>
            <p>THIS being evident, I may aſk, Where is that hard and intolerable yoke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, at which many are ſo ſcandalized? It is purely an imaginary one. Where is that command of God, which you yourſelves can pronounce grievous? In what chapter of the bible is that law, reſpecting the government of your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which you would chuſe to have blotted out or repealed, for the common,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:008667_0151_102faf1e6e581320"/>
or even for your own particular good, in order to have the road to pleaſure, any pleaſure worth deſiring, left more open than it is at preſent? Tho' I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently read the bible, I can, for my own part, find no one command or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition therein, which abridges the happineſs, or real enjoyments, either of mankind in general, or of individuals, ſo that they would upon the whole live more delightfully in the world if it were aboliſhed, than they may under the reſtraints of it. And I may almoſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to tell you, that whenever you ſhall think in your conſciences, after ſerious, calm and deliberate reflection, that you have found ſuch a grievous command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you are at liberty to eraſe it. For whatever you may imagine in the heat of paſſion, and for want of attending to the nature and conſequences of things, I may be confident that, on due and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough reflection, you would be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that all God's commandments are not only holy and juſt, but even good; good for the world, and for yourſelves. For, as was intimated above, religion does not only, not abridge the pleaſures and enjoyments of men in this world, but heightens and improves them all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="unknown:008667_0152_102faf21c67194f8"/>No libertine enjoys that happineſs which is proper to man, conſidered merely as an inhabitant of this world, in ſo great a degree, or in ſuch perfection, as a chriſtian, who
<q>keeps under his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and brings it into ſubjection.</q>
This may perhaps ſeem a paradox at beſt, if not a contradiction. However, it is certainly true; and will be in ſome meaſure apparent only from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſideration. Thoſe impious and vicious men who have, ſhall I ſay, the modeſty, or the impudence, to profeſs a total diſregard to the laws of religion, yet find the neceſſity of preſcribing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſimilar laws and reſtrictions to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, merely with a view at attaining their great and avowed end, pleaſure. They perceive the neceſſity of obſerving theſe ſame rules, many of them at leaſt, in order to their enjoying animal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and gratifications in their greateſt height and perfection. And this, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, may be the true drift and ſcope of the Epicurean philoſophy; which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly miſtaken by thoſe, who exclude all morals from their idea of it. So that whether men believe in God and his providence, or not; whether they will love, reverence and obey him, or the contrary; ſtill they are obliged, if they
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:008667_0153_102faf28270d9ab8"/>
would live in the moſt refined and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant luxury they are capable of, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on themſelves much the ſame laws of temperance and moderation, and a certain oeconomy in their pleaſures, which religion herſelf obliges them to obſerve. The connoiſſieurs in voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, while they have no more ſenſe of religious obligations, than the flocks and herds on which they riot, are yet, in one ſenſe, tho' againſt their will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under the prohibitions, and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and ſelf-denials, which religion impoſes; being forced, if I may ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, to exerciſe the reaſon of men, in order to enjoy the pleaſures of bruits in their greateſt perfection. Which being the caſe, it is a clear proof and demoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that keeping the commandments of God, reſpecting the government of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal paſſions, is ſo far from diminiſhing the happineſs of man, conſidered in his animal and worldly capacity, that it is the greateſt improvement of them. All vicious, irregular, paſſions, as intimated above, are productive of pain and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This is eſpecially true of envy, wrath and reſentment.
<q>Bitter and malevolent tempers puniſh themſelves: They are not always gratified; never
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:008667_0154_102faf29ba979e58"/>
ſo thoroughly as they wiſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore become fuel to their own malice. A ſpiteful man is an unhappy man, as well as an odious character: If he would preſerve eſteem, or hope for it, he muſt hide his heart—It is the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and juſtice of providence, to make malevolent hearts their own tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, and bad men actually hurt themſelves by wiſhing hurt to others. They earn and pre-occupy the pain and miſery, which they ſtudy to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and make retribution to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and deſerving, for hating and reviling them.—Who would chuſe to poſſeſs the bane of a rancorous ſpirit? Who would feel the torture of envy? Who would burn with raging rancour? Whoever hates any man, pays dear for his hate: Whoever is curſed with a revengeful heart, needs no other curſe.</q>
The vicious man, whoſe paſſions are always either rampant, or palled to a nauſea, has certainly a leſs ſhare of real enjoyment, than he who ſtrictly obſerves the commandments of God, following him, and reaſon. The former is always, either like a barque toſſed in a tempeſtuous ſea, or one ſtuck faſt in a miry, motionleſs lake
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:008667_0155_102faf2b812409b8"/>
of ſtagnated water: The latter is like one wafted on a ſmooth ſea by gentle, propititious gales, under a ſerene ſky.— And this is he, who, ſteering his courſe by the ſure compaſs of religion, ſhall ſail into the harbour of bliſs, if there is any ſuch port on the coaſt of human life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we arrive at the haven of endleſs joy. Who then that is truly wiſe for himſelf, would not make haſte to keep God's commandments, were it only for the ſake of that greater degree of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and worldly happineſs, which will thereby accrue to him, than can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained according to the eſtabliſhed order of nature and providence, in the way of irregular and ſinful indulgence?</p>
            <p>BUT it muſt not be omitted here, that beſides the advantages already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, religion affords the beſt relief, and moſt ſolid ſupports, under thoſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, trials and perils, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to men in this preſent evil world. This life is at beſt a weariſome journey thro' a wilderneſs beſet with numerous ills and dangers, which no human pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution or power can either effectually guard againſt, or remove. But they may beſt be borne by him, who has that hope and confidence in God, which the ſincere practice of religion naturally inſpires;
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:008667_0156_102faf2eadb79d00"/>
and they are the moſt intolerable to thoſe, who are deſtitute hereof. Reflect ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly on human life; think of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calamities which come alike to all, and the various evils to which we are expoſed; ſickneſs and pains of number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs kinds; the ill-will, and ill offices of our enemies; the loſs of our friends; the uncertainty of riches, honors and all earthly goods: Conſider the diſorder'd ſtate of the world in general; the fraud, deceit and violence that are found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from age to age; the revolutions and mighty changes that are frequently brought about in the kingdoms and civil affairs of it;— changes, as often for the worſe as for the better: Conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of theſe things, I ſay; and you cannot be wholly inſenſible, either of the happineſs of good men, who have faith, hope and confidence in God, or of the forlorn, diſconſolate condition of the wicked, who are deſtitute of this relief. How great is the ſupport? how unſpeakable the conſolation, when a man is ſuffering adverſity, or foreſees it coming upon him; when he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf encompaſſed with infirmities, ills and dangers; and ſees himſelf, as it were, juſt dropping into the grave, his fleſh and his heart failing him; how unſpeakable is
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:008667_0157_102faf351e935cb0"/>
the conſolation, I ſay, reſulting to a good man in theſe circumſtances, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, that there is a God above, all-wiſe, good and powerful; that this God is his God forever and ever; his friend, and guardian, and portion; that the very hairs of his head are numbered by him; that he will cauſe "all things to work together for good to him"; that he will guide him by his counſel during life, and at death receive him to glory, and joys forevermore? Surely this is the beſt ſupport, that any man can have in ſuch a world of confuſion, danger and death, as this; than which the heart of man cannot conceive a greater, a more ſolid or rational. But it may be further illuſtrated by way of contraſt. Conſider a man labouring under adverſity, or at leaſt apprehenſive of it; conſider him reflecting with himſelf on the viciſſitudes and miſeries of this preſent ſtate; a weak, helpleſs, mortal creature, drawing every day nearer to the grave; and one, to whom time it ſelf would ſoon prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: How miſerable an object does this man appear, while, being an enemy to God, he can draw no relief from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his perfections, providence or friendſhip, or from the hopes of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed immortality? He is left without
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:008667_0158_102faf3723bc54a8"/>
refuge, without any adequate ſupport; he feels many evils, perhaps; and has reaſon to apprehend more and greater; life is burdenſome to him, and death ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; and that judgment which is after it, the moſt terrible of all!—You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive a more miſerable object than this, unleſs your imagination car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries you to the regions of darkneſs, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deſpair. Nor can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of a happier one, than a good man, whoſe "hopes are full of immortality," unleſs your tho'ts aſcend to that glorious region, where mortality is ſwallowed up of life, and hope is turned into frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You ſee then, how ſolid a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port under afflictions and perils, and how great a felicity you deprive your ſelves of, even in this world, ſo long as you delay to keep God's commandments.</p>
            <p>THERE are peculiar and exalted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures attending the practice and hopes of religion; ſuch as a "ſtranger inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddleth not with;" ſuch as a wicked man can form no adequate idea of; ſcarce more than a blind man can of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, or a deaf one of ſounds: It is only experience that can fully make them known. However, all men may form ſome general conception of that peace, that ſenſe of ſecurity, and inward ſatisfaction,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:008667_0159_102faf38b065a9e8"/>
which muſt needs attend a well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope towards God, thro' him "that hath aboliſhed death." Very wicked men may have ſome confus'd, general notion hereof, even by means of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which they have had, at times, of the contrary; I mean of that deep diſtreſs, and anxiety, and terror, which they are at certain ſeaſons thrown into, by a ſenſe of their guilt, and an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of God's righteous diſpleaſure. Is there a wicked man preſent, who does not know what is here intended? Can you not call to mind one <note n="†" place="bottom">The then late terrible Earthquake is here alluded to.</note> time, at leaſt, when you experienced ſuch guilty fears and apprehenſions?—ſuch diſtreſs as words cannot utter? — To ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then, ſurely I need not labour to prove, how great the happineſs is, of being at peace with God, and having confidence towards him. Their want of this hope, at ſuch a ſeaſon, their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſery of an awakened conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of guilt, and apprehenſions of divine wrath, may ſerve in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, at leaſt, to convince them, that good men, whoſe hope is in God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a very different ſort of happineſs, and infinitely ſuperior to that of the workers of iniquity. Verily, it is not
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:008667_0160_102faf3a46dd6a70"/>
ſaid in vain,
<q>Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</q>
It is not ſaid in vain, that
<q>the work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, quietneſs and aſſurance forever.</q>
It is not ſaid in vain of wiſdom, that "all her paths are peace;" that
<q>ſhe is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the happineſs of good men, who are at peace with God thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is not merely that, which naturally reſults from a rational, well-grounded confidence in God's favour: They have, ſometimes at leaſt, a more direct and immediate intercourſe with God, and a ſtill more exalted happineſs ariſing from ſuch intercourſe, than any which reſults from the deductions of reaſon, in the way of argumentation. I would not willingly be an enthuſiaſt. But when the ſcripture ſaith, "Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt": When it ſaith, that the kingdom of God is "joy in the Holy Ghoſt," as well as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and peace: When the ſcriptures ſpeak of God, as the God of all grace and conſolation, who "comforteth his
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:008667_0161_102faf40cfaa7f80"/>
ſaints in all their tribulations", ſo that they greatly rejoice: When they ſpeak of chriſtians as "walking in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Holy Ghoſt": When they ſay, "Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts" <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 4.6.</note>: In fine, when they ſay,
<q>Ye have not received the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage again to fear; but ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of adoption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we cry, Abba, Father: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit itſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt; if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8.15,—17.</note>
               </q>:
When the holy ſcriptures, I ſay, ſpeak ſuch language as this, I cannot eaſily perſuade myſelf to believe, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nothing further, than that good men have peace and joy within, ariſing from a rational conviction, by means of the miraculous works of the Spirit, and his operations in purifying their hearts, or any other objective evidence, that they are in a ſtate of favour with God, and entitled to the inheritance of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. There are ſome, I may preſume to ſay, who have the beſt grounds to think, that by the comforts and joys of
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:008667_0162_102faf43f79998c8"/>
the Holy Ghoſt, and the witneſs of the Spirit, ſomething further, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate is intended, and I may add, more noble and divine, than a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſuaſion of a man's good eſtate, ariſing from any merely objective evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof; tho' I do not ſay, wholly and abſolutely independent of it. In ſhort, God does ſometimes, tho' not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, by the immediate influences of his bleſſed Spirit, cauſe his ſaints to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with joy unſpeakable and full of glory," filling them "with all his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;" with a big, ineffable and divine joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſwallows up all the ſoul; a joy, as much ſurpaſſing, not only the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin, but I had almoſt ſaid, even the merely <hi>rational</hi> pleaſures of piety, as heaven ſurpaſſes earth, or eternity is more laſting than time! I am aware that ſome will probably look on this, as nothing better than enthuſiaſtic rant: To whom, God grant the only full, ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate and ſatisfactory evidence of its reality, the experience of the thing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! There may, indeed, be ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere chriſtians, to whom God may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have thus "manifeſted himſelf," in a way ſo different from that, in which he "manifeſts himſelf unto the world;" and who may expreſs themſelves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:008667_0163_102faf45ba8f3218"/>
on this point. But it may be juſtly apprehended, that the more general and common reaſon, why theſe things are called folly and enthuſiaſm, is, that men are really ſtrangers to the ſpirit and power of religion in their hearts. And there is doubtleſs ſome good meaning of thoſe words, ſo often abuſed and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by cenſorious viſionaries —
<q>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note>
               </q>
But let us not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that our Saviour mocked his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with vain, viſionary hopes, or ſpake to his apoſtles excluſively of other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, when he ſaid, a little before his paſſion,
<q>If ye love me, keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: And I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeeth him not, neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him</q>
—
<q>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: Not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</q>
               <note n="e" place="margin">John 14.15, 16, 17, &amp; 27.</note> Theſe are gracious promiſes of the ſupport, and conſolations
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:008667_0164_102faf4744dc8990"/>
of the Holy Spirit, ſpoken of above; in ſome meaſure diſtinct from, tho' not wholly independent of, that peace and joy, which naturally ariſe from a rational and ſcriptural perſwaſion of a man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtate of favour with God. And the moſt probable reaſon, why chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do not more generally experience theſe divine conſolations, and in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree, is, that they do not aſpire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter greater degrees of holineſs, and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian perfection; but content themſelves with little more than "a name to live." For you will obſerve, that they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed above, by our Saviour, not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but conditionally:—
<q>If ye love me, keep my commandments: And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter,</q>
&amp;c. But I muſt not enlarge; it being time to draw towards a concluſion.</p>
            <p>IT has been ſhown in this diſcourſe, That religion, being a reaſonable ſervice, enjoined upon us by our wiſe and good Creator, muſt needs be ſuppoſed in general conducive to the happineſs of mankind, even in their preſent ſtate. And if we come to fact and experience, it has been ſhown, That a life of irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and vice is naturally productive of many evils and diſquietudes, from which
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:008667_0165_102faf4f5b8f7b20"/>
the contrary courſe of life is free: That religion is ſo far from abridging us of any of the natural pleaſures of life, which are worthy our purſuit, that it improves and exalts them all: That it affords the beſt relief, the moſt ſolid and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſupports, under thoſe numerous trials and afflictions which are common to men in this evil world: And laſtly, That the practice and hopes of religion are attended with other, with noble, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſures, and heavenly joys, to which wicked men are not only ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but of which they cannot even have any proper or adequate conception. From all which conſiderations laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it appears that a religious and truly chriſtian life is, beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, the happieſt that a man can live in this world; and that the pleaſures of the wicked are mean, low, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, when compared with thoſe which good men enjoy. And from hence the main concluſion deſigned to be drawn, appears in a clear and ſtrong light; viz. That it is of great importance to wicked men to make haſte, and not delay to keep the commandments of God, even with regard to their preſent, temporal welfare. For if theſe things are as they have been repreſented, as
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:008667_0166_102faf50ef0ed448"/>
they certainly are, unleſs reaſon, ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and experience all conſpire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, (which is impoſſible) it is the greateſt imprudence and folly for men to perſevere in their ſins; and of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſequence to them, immediately, and in earneſt, to devote themſelves to the ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>SOME other arguments, if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, will be inſiſted upon hereafter. Let me conclude for the preſent, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching wicked men, if there are any ſuch in this aſſembly, duly to conſider that which has now been handled.— Whatever objections you may have in other reſpects, againſt a ſpeedy return to God and your duty, thro' Jeſus Chriſt the redeemer and ſaviour of ſinners; I am almoſt confident you can have none, (after ſeriouſly weighing what has now been offered) on account of any ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed happineſs which this would oblige you to forego: I mean, any which is not abſolutely unworthy the purſuit of reaſonable creatures; and the loſs of which, would not be infinitely more than compenſated, by the pleaſures of piety and virtue. This common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is doubtleſs ſuggeſted by the evil One, that he may deſtroy the ſouls of ſinners, by infuſing into them a ſenſeleſs,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:008667_0167_102faf52f106f2f8"/>
irrational fear, that they will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves miſerable by ſaving them! There is a great degree of infatuation in all ſuch-like apprehenſions; there being, not only no viſible foundation for them in nature; but they being utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the plaineſt dictates of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, revelation and experience, all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Be aſſured that you will be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to true happineſs, to the proper, and almoſt only happineſs of man, ſo long as you continue ſtrangers to true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and "alienated from the life of God." So long as you expect to drink of pleaſure, while at a diſtance from the "fountain of living waters," you will be continually diſappointed, and ſtill thirſty: All the ciſterns you can hew out to yourſelves, will be broken, leaky ones, which will "hold no water;" none that is pure and wholeſome; none but what will, in the end, rather give you a vomit, and bring ſickneſs and death, a terrible death, than chear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and immortalize you. But you know who has ſaid, and his words are true,
<q>Whoſoever drinketh of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt; but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life. <note n="e" place="margin">John 4.14.</note>

And you know alſo, how free, gracious and univerſal the invitation is,
<q>Ho! every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do ye ſpend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not? hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken diligently unto me, — and let your ſoul delight itſelf in fatneſs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your ſoul ſhall live; and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David.</q>

               <note place="margin">SERM VI.</note>IN the three laſt preceeding diſcourſes, the reaſonableneſs and importance of making haſte to keep God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, was ſhown by as many
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:008667_0170_102faf5deee22ab0"/>
different arguments: viz. From a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſhortneſs of human life, and the uncertain duration of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationary ſtate: The greater eaſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming without delay, than if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till the habits of ſin and vice gain more power over us: And laſtly, From a conſideration of the ſuperior happineſs, peace and joy, attending a religious and virtuous life, compared with a life of impiety and vice.</p>
            <p>A FOURTH argument, by God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and aſſiſtance, is now to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the preceeding, to ſhew ſtill more plainly the reaſonableneſs and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of making haſte to keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, in oppoſition to delaying it to another ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>AND the argument of the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhall be drawn from this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the ſooner we heartily engage in the ſervice of God, the greater degree of chriſtian perfection we ſhall probably arrive at in this world; and accordingly ſhall receive ſo much a brighter crown of glory and joy in the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Let us, for the preſent, wave all other conſiderations, and confine our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to this alone, that by God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, it may have it's proper and full effect upon our hearts and conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="unknown:008667_0171_102faf5fcd5d43c0"/>IT was not ſaid above, poſitively, without reſerve, that the ſooner we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to keep the commandments of God, the greater degree of chriſtian perfection, and future felicity, we ſhall attain to; but that this will "probably" be the conſequence. For it may be thought, that this is not univerſally certain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exceptions. If we judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to appearance, it will perhaps be ſaid, that ſome perſons who, as there is reaſon to think, have been truly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and virtuous from their youth, have yet been ſo immerſed in the cares of this life, and ſo ſlothful in their ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, even while they ſerved the Lord, that they have at laſt, when full of days, been chriſtians but of a dwarfiſh ſize; mere babes in Chriſt, with reſpect to their ſpiritual growth and ſtature, tho' men with reſpect to the length of time ſince their ſpiritual birth. To preſerve a due diſtinction of characters in our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's parable of the <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> ſower, it may ſeem requiſite to underſtand ſuch very imperfect, tho' ſincere chriſtians, as theſe, where it is ſaid, that
<q>ſome fell among thorns; and the thorns ſprung up and choked them <note n="b" place="margin">Ver. 7.</note>.</q>
Our Lord explains himſelf thus, "He alſo that received the ſeed among thorns, is he that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:008667_0172_102faf62d3114d48"/>
the word: and the care of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful <note n="c" place="margin">Ver. 22.</note>": Or, as it is explained, perhaps with greater exactneſs and preciſion, in the parallel place, they "bring no fruit to <hi>perfection</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 7.14.</note>". But whatever may be the true, preciſe meaning of theſe words, there is no reaſonable ground to doubt, but that the character alluded to above, is a real character in the chriſtian world. And tho' the labor, even of ſuch imperfect and ſlothful chriſtians, ſhall not be wholly in vain; yet, as they have not "<hi>abounded</hi> always in the work of the Lord," there is no ground to think, that "an entrance will be miniſtred to them <hi>abundantly,</hi> into his everlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom." If they gain an admittance into that bleſſed ſtate, as they doubtleſs will, they may well be content with an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior manſion.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand it will be ſaid, That there have been examples of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who, after long delays, have at length turned their feet unto God's teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies; and who have, by redeeming the time with uncommon diligence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a peculiar bleſſing of heaven, arrived to high attainments in religion, to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent degree of ſanctity, and chriſtian
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:008667_0173_102faf67d9493888"/>
perfection: And ſuch perſons will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs receive a glorious recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in proportion to their actual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in wiſdom and holineſs; not in proportion to the length of time ſince they ceaſed to ſerve divers luſts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and began to "ſerve the Lord Chriſt." Such reflections as theſe may ſeem to be verified, or in ſome meaſure confirmed, by our daily experience and obſervation of what comes to paſs in the common affairs and buſineſs of human life. For a man may be at his proper work, the buſineſs of his particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, all the day, even from morning till night; and yet purſue it with ſo much indifference and ſloth, that he ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh but little at laſt. Tho' he is before-hand with the ſun in his riſing, when he goeth forth to his labour, and after it in his reclining to reſt, he finds but little fruit of his labour which he has taken under it. On the contrary, do we not ſometimes ſee a man indulging to ſloth the former part of the day, on the bed of eaſe, ſaying,
<q>A little more ſleep, a little more ſlumber,</q>
rouſed up in the afternoon; and applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his buſineſs with ſo much addreſs and induſtry, that the ſetting ſun beholds much greater effects of his labour, than
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:008667_0174_102faf6af3de1b50"/>
of the other's; and his profit proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably greater? And all this, it will be ſaid, may be applied to men's religious concerns and labours, to the time when they reſpectively begin, and the rewards they ſhall finally receive.</p>
            <p>Now the truth of theſe repreſentations and facts is not to be abſolutely denied; tho' ſuch inſtances as thoſe alluded to, are comparatively rare. And the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral truth of the propoſition, which is the argument of this diſcourſe, is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially infringed by a few ſingular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that may be found of the contrary; which is the utmoſt that can be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But if we look a little more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into the natural import of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion above, it may at leaſt be doubted, whether ſuch examples as theſe, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally any exceptions at all to the truth of it. For, pleaſe to obſerve, that when it is ſaid, The ſooner we heartily engage in the ſervice of God, the greater degree of chriſtian perfection we ſhall arrive at, &amp;c, the compariſon implied, does not lie between <hi>us</hi> and <hi>other</hi> perſons, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to <hi>ourſelves</hi>; and lies wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>our</hi> beginning earlier or later in life, to keep God's commands, and the greater or leſs degree of perfection and happineſs <hi>we</hi> ourſelves ſhall attain to, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:008667_0175_102faf6c7af4c9e8"/>
as we do one or the other; it being ſtill ſuppoſed that we engage hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily in the ſervice of God, whenever we engage in it, and perſevere therein with diligence. Which being conſidered, the propoſition, I ſuppoſe, is not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, but certainly true; however true it may be, at the ſame time, that ſome perſons who begin to ſerve God at a late ſeaſon of life, may, by uncommon dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and a peculiar bleſſing on their endeavours, make greater advances in piety and virtue than ſome others, who did not delay ſo long.</p>
            <p>AND now, avoiding all uſeleſs ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as much as poſſible, let me more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly explain and urge the preſent argument, under the following propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT religion is progreſſive in the hearts and lives of good men:</p>
            <p>THAT, by natural conſequence, the ſooner any one begins to be ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, the greater improvement he will make at laſt in holineſs and virtue:</p>
            <p>THAT the greater degree of chriſtian perfection we attain to, the greater will be our happineſs in the world to come: And laſtly, which is the practical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from the whole,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="unknown:008667_0176_102faf6e04e7ad20"/>THAT it is highly reaſonable, and of great importance to us, to make haſte, or that we do not delay, to turn our feet unto God's teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>THE former of theſe propoſitions, now to be enlarged upon in their order, is, That religion is progreſſive in the hearts and lives of good men. When a ſinner is converted from the error of his way, to the wiſdom of the juſt, he is not at once made perfect in holineſs, or in any chriſtian virtue: So far from it, that no man attains to perfection, ſtrictly ſpeaking, in this life; there is always room for improvement both in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and in virtue, how long ſoever a man has been engaged in the ſervice of God. And there is, generally at leaſt, moſt room and occaſion for ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, in thoſe who are newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon a religious courſe of life. However poſſible and eaſy it might be ſuppoſed to be, for God, by his grace and Spirit, at once to produce a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect change in the heart of a wicked man, as compleat and perfect as is ever effected in this world; yet we know it is not agreeable to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed method of divine grace to effect at once ſuch a thorough change. God is pleaſed, after our regeneration, to leave
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:008667_0177_102faf758b049268"/>
our improvement in goodneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in ſome meaſure, to our ſelves; I do not mean independently of him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom we can do nothing; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his gracious influence, or by his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. And thus it is, that from very imperfect degrees of goodneſs, the new man advances to higher, to a nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of God, after whoſe image he was "created in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs <note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note>" That the ſaints thus make progreſs in piety and virtue, is plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the doctrine and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſcripture, as well as to experience. Our Saviour ſays, that the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of muſtard-ſeed, the leaſt of all ſeeds, which yet groweth till it "becometh a tree." This is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, not only to the external, viſible kingdom of God in this world, under Chriſt, who is to reign till every knee ſhall bow to him; but alſo to that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God which is "within us," and which "cometh not with obſervation;" or that kingdom of heaven which, the apoſtle ſays, "is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt." This kingdom, as well as the external, is at firſt ſo ſmall and imperfect, that it may be fitly compared to a grain of muſtard-ſeed, tho', by the
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:008667_0178_102faf7714eb4150"/>
bleſſing of God, it will in its progreſs become great and flouriſhing, even like the cedars of Lebanon. Agreeably here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, chriſtians are exhorted to "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt." It is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that "the path of the juſt is as the ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day." St. Paul tells thoſe, to whom he wrote one of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, he was "perſwaded that He, who had begun a good work in them, would perform it unto the day of Chriſt." The ſame apoſtle having obſerved, in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Epheſians, that when Chriſt aſcended, he gave to his church, apoſtles, paſtors, teachers, &amp;c. immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, as the end and deſign of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, — "for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt; that we henceforth be no more children; — but ſpeaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things." This may be underſtood, both with reference to the church in general, and to particular perſons. In conformity whereto, St.
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:008667_0179_102faf78dd4679f0"/>
Paul, even after he had been many years a faithful miniſter of Chriſt, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the very chief of the apoſtles, ſays of himſelf, under an humble ſenſe of his infirmities and imperfections — "Not as tho' I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus. Brethren, I count not myſelf to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; but this one thing I do, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, I preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus."</p>
            <p>Now all theſe, and innumerable other paſſages of holy ſcripture, plainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe religion to be progreſſive in the hearts and lives of men; to be weak in it's beginning, or riſe, and gradually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards perfection, by the care and induſtry of good men, under the ſmiles and influences of heaven, or the gracious operations of God's ſpirit. And this repreſentation, as was intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is verifyed by the experience of good men in all ages and generations. As wicked men and ſeducers often, not always, "wax worſe and worſe"; ſo good men, generally at leaſt, wax bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:008667_0180_102faf7a6ea49ce0"/>
and better; "perfecting holineſs in the fear of God"; and obtaining, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, a more compleat victory over their luſts, till they are finally made even "more than conquerors, thro' him that loved them". Thoſe who are born of the Spirit, tho' they are at firſt truly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s of God, and are in one ſenſe perfect, <hi>viz.</hi> as no intire member is wanting in them; yet they are ſpoken of as being but "babes in Chriſt"; who accordingly need to be "fed with milk", that they may "grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by"; not with "ſtrong meat", which
<q>belongeth to them that are of full age, even thoſe who, by reaſon of uſe, have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil.</q>
It is needleſs, I imagine, to enlarge any farther in the proof of this point. Reaſon, ſcripture and experience, all concur in eſtabliſhing its truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the poſſibility of a rational doubt concerning it. Let us therefore proceed to the next remark mentioned above; which is indeed a plain conſequence from this; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT the ſooner any one begins to be ſincerely religious, the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement he will make at laſt in true wiſdom, virtue and holineſs; the greater degree of chriſtian perfection he will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:008667_0181_102faf8243cd30b8"/>
to at the cloſe of life. Whatever is progreſſive in its nature, requires time, and is improved, advanced and perfected thereby. There is no making progreſs in any thing, but by time. And if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in men's hearts and lives is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive, according to the eſtabliſhed courſe of nature, and the methods of God's grace, agreeably to what has been ſaid above, it follows by plain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the ſooner we turn our feet unto God's teſtimonies, the greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs we ſhall have made in chriſtian piety, when our days are numbered and finiſhed. The nearer our lives are to a period, when we begin to fear and ſerve God, the leſs opportunity we have for improvement, and the lower will be our attainments at laſt. Notwithſtanding what was ſaid in the beginning of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, any man who begins his worldly labor with the day, and is diligent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, will do more than if he delay'd till it was far ſpent, and the night was at hand, "wherein no man can work". Accordingly all men who are wiſe in the management of their temporal affairs, and hope to thrive by their induſtry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bleſſing of God, are early at their buſineſs. And you would think <hi>that</hi> man talk'd very irrationally, who
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:008667_0182_102faf83ca112dd0"/>
ſhould tell his poor neighbour, that he might ſtand almoſt all the day idle, and then make up for it, by doubling his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence when the ſun was juſt ſetting. This is contrary to experience, and the common ſenſe of mankind. All which is, in general, applicable to the higher concerns and buſineſs of religion. Youth is the morning of human life; death the evening or night: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if we begin to be wiſe and good, and to work out our ſalvation, in the former, and perſevere diligently in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, we ſhall at laſt be wiſer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more effectually ſecure our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, than if we delay till we are paſt the meridian of our days, and death is at hand. This is as certain as it is, that if a man travel diligently all the day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning his journey with the ſun, he will get farther on his road at evening, than if he delay'd till the afternoon.</p>
            <p>BUT if we come to fact and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the ſureſt guides in all caſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in recourſe may be had to them, it is plain, that thoſe perſons who have known and ſerved God from their youth, have been much oftner eminent for their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and great improvements in chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, in their old age, than they who have lived as without God in the world,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:008667_0183_102faf85ab8ce148"/>
till gray hairs were upon them. Tho' we ſhould allow that there are ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions here, they are but few. And as to thoſe very perſons who may be looked upon as exceptions, I mean thoſe who have made a great progreſs in a little time, towards the cloſe of life; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would have been ſtill far more eminent for their ſanctity and chriſtian perfection, had they not delayed ſo long to keep God's commandments. If this is allowed, it is ſufficient to my preſent purpoſe, as it ſhows that the degree of our attainments in true wiſdom and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, depends in a great meaſure, under God, on the time that we begin to know and ſerve him. The earlier in life we do this, the more perfect we ſhall be, when the time of our departure out of this world is at hand, and we are going to "receive the things done in the body." This point, I imagine, need not be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſiſted on, it being ſo clear from what was ſaid above, concerning the progreſſive nature of religion.</p>
            <p>THE next thing to be conſidered is, That the greater degree of chriſtian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection we attain to in this life, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be our glory and happineſs in the world to come. The recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which the ſaints ſhall receive here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:008667_0184_102faf88de863580"/>
is not, indeed, a reward of merit, ſtrictly ſpeaking, but of grace; "the gift of God thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord." However, the holy ſcriptures themſelves often call it by the name of a reward: And our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſays expreſly,
<q>Behold I come quickly, and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is with me to give to every man</q>,
&amp;c. Now if the righteous are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, it is moſt agreeable to reaſon and ſcripture to ſuppoſe, that they ſhall be rewarded in proportion to the degree of their goodneſs and holineſs reſpectively, however undeſerving all may be; the perfecter here, the happier hereafter. This ſuppoſition beſt accords to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of God, as the all-wiſe, good and perfect governor of the world; with whom there is no reſpect of perſons in judgment; who is neither influenced by any blind, groundleſs prejudice againſt, nor by weak partiality in favour of, any of thoſe ſouls which he has made, and which are all equally his, the ſouls of the parents, and the ſouls of the children. It is natural for us to expect, that the common Father of ſpirits, the Father of all, will diſpenſe his favors to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in a ſtate of retribution, not at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or with the capriciouſneſs of a lawleſs, unregulated ſovereignty; but
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:008667_0185_102faf8c18c199c8"/>
according to ſome wiſe, proper, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rule of diſtribution. And if it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect, that the righteous judge of the earth, how ſovereign ſoever he may be, will do thus; what method of diſtribution is ſo likely to be obſerved by him, as that of conferring greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of happineſs on his ſervants, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act proportion to the degrees of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection reſpectively, or their diligence and fidelity in his ſervice? Can we think of any other rule or method to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in this matter, which ſo eaſily and naturally falls in with our ideas of God, as the wiſe, juſt and good governor of the world? or indeed, which it would not be very difficult, at leaſt, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile with ſuch a character? In this way, there will ſtill be encouragement left for all, even the moſt perfect, as well as moſt imperfect chriſtians, to exert themſelves, and to abound always in the work of the Lord, in hopes of attaining to greater glory and felicity in the regions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: And the belief hereof has an apparent tendency to promote piety and virtue amongſt men. On any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſition, there is far leſs encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to virtue; any other would have a manifeſt tendency to damp our endeavours after perfection, and be very
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:008667_0186_102faf8da116c3a0"/>
prejudicial to the intereſt of virtue in the world. For it is rather folly and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than true wiſdom, for us to pretend to a more diſintereſted and refined vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, than that of the captain of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who hath ſet us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps; of whom it is ſaid, in his humble and afflicted ſtate in this world, that
<q>for the joy that was ſet before him, he endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>IT is, moreover, to be conſidered here, that the happineſs of reaſonable, moral and religious creatures, muſt almoſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be in proportion to the degree of their wiſdom and moral perfection, in whatever ſtate or world they are. We find it ſo, even in this world, almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably, amidſt the confuſions, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent diſorders of the preſent ſtate; and notwithſtanding the many ſeeming hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances and obſtacles that are in the way of virtue, or obſtructions to the natural and genuine effects thereof. In the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate, we are aſſured theſe obſtacles or obſtructions ſhall be removed out of the way. It is therefore at leaſt probable, if not certain, from the nature of the thing, that in that other ſtate, virtue ſhall in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably, and without exception, have it's full effect; that it ſhall actually produce
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:008667_0187_102faf9280ad2438"/>
thoſe conſequences, which it partly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth now, in a greater degree, much more uniformly and immutably; ſo that the ſaints ſhall of courſe be the happier, as they are wiſer, and more holy, or more like God, "bleſſed forever." In that ſtate, where bodily pains and ſickneſs are no more; where the "wicked ceaſe from troubling"; where the ſociety ſhall conſiſt only of ſuch as are good and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, it muſt needs be, that the meaſure of each one's happineſs and glory, will be the degree of his capacity for rational happineſs; i. e. his moral perfection, or likeneſs to God.</p>
            <p>WHAT has been obſerved above, could not be denied, or called in queſtion, on any principles of reaſon, even tho' the holy ſcriptures had been intirely ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as to this point. Had they only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us in general, that good men were to be rewarded hereafter, without ſaying any thing particularly concerning the rule that was to be obſerved in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring this reward; we might rationally infer from the divine perfections, and from the nature of the thing, that the good would be rewarded reſpectively, in proportion to their virtue and perfection: eſpecially conſidering, what is ſeen and experienced even in this world of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:008667_0188_102faf9405c60ed0"/>
that men are now generally, if not univerſally, happy in the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; for there are very few, if any exceptions.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, the ſcriptures are far from being ſilent as to this point: They plainly teach this doctrine, ſo encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to men, ſo apparently calculated to promote piety and holineſs in the world. Our Saviour has not only told us, that in his Father's houſe there are "many manſions," intimating that they were prepared and made ſuitable for the gueſts, they were reſpectively to receive; but he ſpeaks of ſome perſons, whoſe reward ſhall be "great in heaven;" emphatically great; they having diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves by their eminent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and faithfulneſs, under ſome peculiar circumſtances of difficulty and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. The apoſtle Paul does not only tell us in general, that whatſoever a man ſoweth, that he ſhall alſo reap; but, that "he that ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſparingly; and that he that ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap alſo bountifully:" Which language is not the leſs intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe it is metaphorical; but is as fully expreſſive of the thing here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as if it had been ſaid, that he ſhall receive an abundant reward, who
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:008667_0189_102faf9999a28000"/>
abounds in piety and good works. It is ſaid of ſome, in the parabolical way, that they had dominion given them over "ten cities," becauſe they had gained "ten pounds;" others, over "five cities," who had gained "five," &amp;c. The true moral of which, agreeable to the point before us, cannot eaſily be miſtaken by any one, who is not willingly ignorant and deceived. And, indeed, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expreſſion in the new teſtament, that men ſhall be rewarded "according to their works," plainly implies the ſame thing. For the righteous will not, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, be rewarded "according to their works," merely by having a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beſtowed on them, unleſs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be alſo in ſome ſuitable proportion to their works, reſpectively; and ſo, greater or leſs in degree, according to the degree of their goodneſs, and moral attainments. To this I may ſubjoin, without a comment, which is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, the words of the apoſtle:
<q>There is one glory of the ſun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the ſtars; for one ſtar differeth from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtar in glory. <hi>So alſo is the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is, however, one objection which may perhaps ariſe here, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:008667_0190_102faf9e345867e8"/>
on a miſconſtruction of our Lord's parable of the labourers in the vineyard <note n="f" place="margin">Matth. Ch. 20.</note>, which it will be proper briefly to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, before we proceed any farther. It is ſaid of theſe labourers, ſome of whom came to work in the vineyard in the morning, and others, not till the eleventh hour, that at night they all received an equal reward, "every man a penny". <note n="g" place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> At which the former "murmured"; to one of whom the Lord of the vineyard anſwered, "Friend, I do thee no wrong: —
<q>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becauſe I am good <note n="h" place="margin">Ver. 13.15.</note>?</q>
It may poſſibly, at firſt view, ſeem the deſign of this parable to intimate, not only that God might without injuſtice, but that he finally will, beſtow an equal reward on all good men, whether they have ſerved him from their youth, or only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of life; or, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any diſtinction between them, in reſpect of the different degrees of their piety and goodneſs. This, however, is by no mean the intent of the parable.</p>
            <p>THE known partiality and pride of the Jews, who had long been God's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people; their contempt of the Gentiles; their diſdaining the thoughts of their ever being put on a footing with
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:008667_0191_102faf9fb94b8e88"/>
themſelves in the kingdom or church of God, ſo as to be equally heirs of eternal life; theſe things, I ſay, give us the true clue for interpreting this parable. The church, or kingdom of God in this world, is here repreſented under the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a vineyard. God's calling different people or nations into his church, in different periods of the world, the Jews firſt, and afterwards the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, is repreſented by the Lord of the vineyard's hiring labourers at different times of the day, ſome in the morning, and ſome at the eleventh hour. Under the ſimilitude of his giving every man a penny at night, without any regard to the time when they came into the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, is repreſented to us God's deſign, in the day of judgment, to beſtow on the faithful Gentiles as great a reward, as on the faithful Jews, tho' not called into his church and kingdom till long after them. This is the true intent of the parable: Not that individuals, particular perſons, whether Jews or Gentiles, ſhould not be variouſly rewarded hereafter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree of their goodneſs (which would be repugnant both to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to many clear teſtimonies of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture); but that no difference ſhould be made between Jews and Gentiles, as ſuch;
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:008667_0192_102fafa14e08be30"/>
tho' the former were God's people ſo long before the latter; and therefore expected, in all other things to have the pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, as what of right belonged to them. It was to humble this vain confidence, and arrogance, of the Jews, that our Lord more eſpecially ſpake this parable. And, indeed, he plainly intimates, both in the verſe immediately preceeding, and in the cloſe of it, that ſome of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who were laſt in the church of God on earth, might be firſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven above. In ſhort, the words of the apoſtle, <note n="i" place="margin">Gal. 3.28, 29.</note> are a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this parable, tho' they do not take in all the parts of it:
<q>There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jew nor Greek,</q>
ſays he,
<q>there is neither bond nor free — for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus: And if ye be Chriſt's, then are ye Abraham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</q>
And the main deſign of it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtrated by our Lord's own words to the Jews <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 13.29, 30.</note>;
<q>And they ſhall come from the eaſt, and from the weſt, and from the north, and from the ſouth; and ſhall ſet down in the kingdom of God. And behold, there are laſt which ſhall be firſt, and there are firſt which ſhall be laſt.</q>
And there is the more reaſon for interpreting this
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:008667_0193_102f74f84a93ded8"/>
parable agreeably hereto, becauſe it is both introduced and cloſed with almoſt the ſame words;
<q>But many that are firſt, ſhall be laſt; and the laſt ſhall be firſt,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>WE may therefore, notwithſtanding this parable, be very certain from the reflections above, eſpecially from the paſſages of ſcripture before referred to, that God will hereafter beſtow a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed reward in heaven, on thoſe who have early devoted themſelves to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and been eminently faithful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: A doctrine very important in its conſequences, as it affords the greateſt encouragement to virtue; which would be apt to flag and languiſh, even in the beſt of men, were it not animated from time to time, by ſuch-like reflections.</p>
            <p>BUT I come now more particularly to draw the practical concluſion from the premiſes, thus eſtabliſhed; which is, that ſinners ſhould not delay, but make haſte to keep God's commandments: An inference, which all muſt needs ſee, is juſtly deduced. For if religion be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive in the heart and life; if the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we begin to be wiſe and virtuous, the more likely we are to attain to high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of chriſtian perfection; and, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the more perfect we are in this
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:008667_0194_102fafab9efa4470"/>
world, the more happy we ſhall be in the other; if theſe things are ſo, ſurely it is highly reaſonable, and of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to us all, to be ſpeedy in our return to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, inſtead of delaying to keep his teſtimonies. Our own intereſt is far more eſſentially concerned herein, than in any thing elſe, which we can poſſibly conceive of; and doubtleſs, what makes any thing to be of importance to us, is its connection with our own well-being.</p>
            <p>AND, for what is it worth while to exert ourſelves, to riſe up early, and ſit up late, and eat the bread of carefulneſs? For what does it concern us to make haſte, rather than that we may obtain a diſtinguiſhed crown of glory in heaven! If to be, in an eminent degree, like to God; if to be high in his ſavour and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem; if to be greatly bleſſed among the bleſſed; if to have, as it were, a double portion among the ſons of God; if to have an abode in one of the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manſions in his houſe; and, perhaps, caught up even to the third heaven, where the apoſtle was; I ſay, if it is not worth our while to be in haſte for theſe things, it may be preſumed, no one can tell, what is ſo; or what is worthy even the leaſt, or lateſt concern of man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:008667_0195_102fafad2bd753e0"/>YOU are probably, moſt, or all of you, my brethren, ſometimes very eager in certain purſuits; in ſo much haſte, that you can ſcarce allow your ſelves time to take your needful reſt, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Be ſo kind, at leaſt to yourſelves, as to pauſe a little here; and reflect, What the aims and purſuits are, on which you are ſo intent, in ſo great a hurry, and which will admit of no delay. Have you ſome end in view, which is truly worthy and noble? which being attained, will make you a full compenſation? Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it may be ſo. But, if you will not cenſure me, as being too prying, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive, into what is particularly <hi>your own concern,</hi> I would beg leave juſt to aſk fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether the object of all this haſte and care, is beyond death and the grave, in the world to come, or in this world? If the former, you are then in haſte, and intent on "ſeeking the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs"; that you may obtain an exceeding great reward in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and be, in a diſtinguiſhed ſenſe "<hi>His,</hi> in the day when he makes up his jewels". Nothing can be more reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable than this: Angels applaud this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, this haſte, this eagerneſs: angels ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver over, and protect you; and may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſtill miniſter to you, as to the "heirs
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:008667_0196_102fafb05af96928"/>
of ſalvation". But you muſt excuſe me; methinks I hear one and other, ſaying,
<q>This is not what we are ſeeking after, what we are ſo intent upon.</q>
Well then, you are thus eager and intent, in ſo much haſte, about ſomething in this world. If it is not, that you may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in the kingdom of heaven, hereafter, it is, that you may attain to diſtinguiſhing honours, or riches, here; or, that you may gratify to the full, your ſenſual appetites. But poſſibly you may be as unſucceſsful in theſe purſuits as the moſt are. But if not; and you ſhould become in power a Caeſar, in riches a Craeſus, in pleaſure a Luccullus or Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus, how long are you to continue thus great, wealthy, and voluptuous? Always? But if you were, what is this in compariſon of what you would gain, by making haſte to keep God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and having him your friend and portion forever? Alas! your hearts are ſet on vanity and bubbles: you catch greedily at ſtraws and trifles; and even at ſhadows, as is ſaid in the fable, while you loſe the ſubſtance; the heavenly crown, the true riches, the pearl of great price, the pleaſures which are at God's right-hand. Be wiſer for your ſelves; love your ſelves better; and without
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:008667_0197_102fafb6c67f1dd0"/>
further delay, turn your feet unto God's teſtimonies, in keeping which "there is great reward" to all; eſpecially to thoſe who do it early, and attain to high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of perfection. Amongſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, there are ſome as much more his children than others, by their eminent piety and virtue, as ſome are more the children of the devil than others, by their greater wickedneſs and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. Their portion reſpectively will, as has been ſhown, be accordingly. Let it be your endeavour, that you may be as highly exalted in heaven, as others will be low in the place of torment, when all the wicked are "thruſt down to hell:" As there is reaſon to fear, very many of thoſe will be, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>LET me therefore conclude this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, by beſeeching thoſe who name the name of Chriſt, and are now going to receive the memorials of his body broken, and his blood ſhed, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, <note n="*" place="bottom">N.

All the rituals of religion, all the external ordinances of the goſpel, were deſigned to anſwer moral ends: Not, as many would flatter themſelves, that the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them might have a diſpenſation from obſerving moral obligations, the moſt fundamental and indiſpenſable of all others. It is naturally and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expected, that thoſe who make ſuch a profeſſion of religion, ſhould abound in thoſe fruits of righteouſneſs, which are, by Jeſus Chriſt, to the glory and praiſe of God. "What do ye more than others?" Let us now, and always, eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, whereby we ſhew forth his death till he come, in ſuch a humble, pious and grateful commemoration of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; with ſuch a juſt ſenſe of the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate deſign of this inſtitution, as will now be acceptable to God our Saviour, and have a good influence on our future lives; that we may be made really, and internally, the better by it; and live more devoted to Him, who died for us,
<q>the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us unto God.</q>
The ceremonial inſtitutions of the goſpel, were, like the miniſters of it, given "for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſaints;— that we may grow
<q>up into him in all things, who is the
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:008667_0199_102fb0599de8ebe0"/>
Head, even Chriſt</q>.
If our minds are ſufficiently enlarged to receive the great ideas here expreſſed; if God, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the "light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſo ſhined into our hearts, as to give us the light of the knowledge of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the face of Jeſus Chriſt"; we ſhall be in no danger of perverting the deſign of this ſacred ordinance, or abuſing it to licentiouſneſs. We ſhall thereby, grow in grace, in goodneſs, in the love of God and man, and every chriſtian virtue. Thus,
<q>when he who is our life ſhall appear, we alſo ſhall appear with him in glory</q>.
And ſince it is to be, in the reſurrection of the dead, as it is now,
<q>one ſtar differing from another in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</q>
it will be a noble ambition in us to endeavour to excel in virtue here, that we may appear with a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luſtre in that bleſſed day, when all

            <p>FOUR arguments have already been inſiſted on,<note place="margin">SERM VII.</note> in order to ſhow the reaſonableneſs and importance of making
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:008667_0201_102fb05e1b4e0938"/>
haſte to keep God's commandments. Theſe arguments were, The ſhortneſs, and uncertain duration of our probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtate: The greater eaſe of reforming now, than of doing it hereafter: The ſuperior happineſs attending a religious and virtuous life: And the greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and glory, to which we ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by devoting ourſelves early to the ſervice of God. It is propoſed, by divine aſſiſtance, to ſtate and urge another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in this diſcourſe, with the ſame general view, of ſhowing you the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of making haſte in this matter.</p>
            <p>THE argument here intended, ſhall be drawn from a conſideration of the peculiar amiableneſs of religion and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the young, the peculiar infamy of vice in mature life, and the greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor we do to God and our Redeemer, by making haſte to keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than if this is delayed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, or even the meridian of our days. This argument, you perceive, is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to operate upon that ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that deſire of applauſe, that dread ſhame, that quick and delicate ſenſe of things, which are natural to ingenuous minds, before perſons are gone far in the paths of vice; rather than it is to work on perſons of a dull, a rough, crabbed,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:008667_0202_102fb062ceee9dd8"/>
or ſour nature, made ſtill worſe by cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary ſinning; eſpecially, than it is to work on quite hardned, veteran tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors; to whoſe impious rebellion and war againſt heaven, nothing but the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of damnation, and perhaps not even they, can put a period.</p>
            <p>SOME, yea, many, will probably look on the argument mentioned above, as being of very little weight or force; and eſpecially after thoſe more ſubſtantial, or, if I may ſo expreſs it, more groſs and palpable ones, which have been handled in ſome preceeding diſcourſes. For I am not inſenſible, that there are many perſons of ſuch a ſaturnine, lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and indelicate make, both among the old and the young, that they can ſcarce apprehend the force of any motives or arguments, beſides thoſe that either promiſe them ſome happineſs, or menace them with ſome evil, of a groſſer kind. Accordingly, the holy ſcriptures abound with threatnings and promiſes, motives and arguments of the latter ſort; ſuch as ſet before men bleſſing and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, great and ſenſible evils, and great and ſenſible good, reſembled to thoſe things which are commonly the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the moſt valued in this world. And arguments of this kind are probably
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:008667_0203_102fb064a09aae00"/>
of the moſt general uſe and benefit to men, conſidering what their frame is; how groſs their ſenſes and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of things commonly are. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are other conſiderations, which ought not to be wholly neglected, as they may give an additional weight to theſe; and, indeed, may poſſibly have a greater influence on perſons of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous temper, than thoſe more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ones, alluded to above. And it is to be hoped, there are not wanting ſome amongſt us, who can apprehend, and even feel the force of that, which is to be illuſtrated in this diſcourſe. I have called it but one argument: However, it muſt be reſolved into, and conſidered under, the following particulars, which are the conſtituent parts thereof: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT religion is peculiarly amiable and honorable in youth:</p>
            <p>THAT vice is peculiarly odious and infamous in age:</p>
            <p>THAT by an early devoting ourſelves to God, we do the moſt honour to Him, and our Redeemer:</p>
            <p>AND therefore, That it becomes the young, as they regard either their own honor, or God's glory, to make haſte, and not delay, to keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this being the obvious concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:008667_0204_102fb066288ec830"/>
from the premiſes, and the great point in view. You perceive by the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the preſent argument, that it is addreſſed chiefly to the young; and not equally to all ſuch; but principally to thoſe of them, who are of a more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous diſpoſition: For there is little ground to hope that it will have much influence on thoſe, who have no ſenſe of honor or diſgrace; but are wholly devoted to low and brutal pleaſures.</p>
            <p>TO return then: RELIGION and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue are peculiarly amiable and laudable in the young. Religion, or the ſervice of God, being in itſelf a reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is, indeed, becoming and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at all ages, at all ſeaſons of life, in all perſons without exception, whether old or young, great or ſmall. But that which is ſo fitting and decent, both in the decline, and in the dawn of human life, has ſtill a peculiar grace and beauty, and the moſt attractive charms, in the latter. God himſelf is pleaſed to expreſs a ſpecial complacency in thoſe that fear him in their youth. And all wiſe and good men are more particularly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the appearances of a pious and virtuous diſpoſition, in thoſe that are juſt coming into the world, as it were, than in thoſe that are juſt going off the
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:008667_0205_102fb06dccefdbf0"/>
ſtage. This is a known fact, which does not need any formal proof to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the truth of it. I appeal to the high commendations of early piety in the holy ſcriptures; to the writings of good men, and the common ſenſe and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mankind; I mean, of the wiſe and virtuous. But however certain and acknowledged this fact may be, it will be neither an impertinent curioſity, nor a miſ-ſpence of time, to inquire a little into the grounds hereof; or whence it comes to paſs, that virtuous youth is thus more amiable and honorable in the eyes of men, tho' perhaps leſs venerable, than virtuous age.</p>
            <p>NOW youth, according to prevailing cuſtom, and indeed, according to a too prevalent opinion in the world, is a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for levity, in which the paſſions are to be indulged; and wherein it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively rare to find a perſon with a ſerious brow, or of a ſober mind. This is far leſs the caſe in more advanced years. Age is, almoſt of courſe, grave and ſolid, at leaſt in appearance; ſo that the appearance of religion therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more uſual and common, becomes the leſs ſtriking and engaging, the leſs worthy of notice; to be ſure, of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="unknown:008667_0206_102fb06f521bcda0"/>CAN you tell why the firſt flowers of the ſpring, or the earlieſt-ripe fruit, has a peculiar charm, and delights both the eye and fancy, more than thoſe of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer, or autumn, tho' perhaps of the ſame ſort, and even more perfect in their kind? If you can reſolve this queſtion, which is no very difficult one, you will, at leaſt in part, diſcover the true reaſon, why religion and virtue in youth, have a more engaging form and appearance, than in age. This is an indication of a promptneſs, and true greatneſs of mind, beyond the years of the ſubject, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to cuſtom; and to corrupt maxims, which give too great allowance to the indiſcretions, the follies, and vices of youth. It is an indication of an early-ripe judgment, of a premature wiſdom; and, if I may ſo expreſs it, proves the ſuperior excellency of the ſoil, or the greater care and pains taken in cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, whereby it yields ſo early a crop of virtue. It is not therefore ſtrange that thoſe, who have a juſt ſenſe of the worth and importance of virtue in every age, ſhould be more eſpecially delighted with it in an age, wherein it is ſo unuſual. It charms, not only by it's intrinſick va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but by the ſingularity of it in that age, and in ſuch perſons; as a rich dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:008667_0207_102fb070da96fdd8"/>
or wedge of gold, found in a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, would be a much more engaging curioſity, than one of equal value, ſeen in a palace. But, to return to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſimilitude: Should we behold a lilly of the field, arrayed in more beauty than Solomon in all his glory, before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhow'd their heads, and while their roots, perhaps, lay covered with froſt and ſnow, it would naturally attract our admiration in that ſeaſon, tho' we might little regard it a month or two later. 'Tis thus we admire the virtue of youth, while we comparatively diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that of mature age. Or ſhould a fruit-tree of a particular kind, which uſed commonly to bear, not till the fifth or ſixth year after planting (when ſome of its branches, perhaps, already began to wither) bud, and bloſſom, and bear fruit plentifully, the firſt or ſecond year, while all its boughs were green and flouriſhing, every ſpectator would be pleaſed with ſuch a rarity. Well, therefore, may we be ſtruck, and particularly pleaſed, with ſo rare a phaenomenon, as a very young perſon bringing forth much of that fruit, by which our Father in heaven is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Well may we look on ſuch a one, as a diſtinguiſhed plant of renown in the garden of God, while older ones, tho'
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:008667_0208_102fb073db86c0c0"/>
equally, or more fruitful, are little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
            <p>IT is naturally expected, that the hoary head ſhould be found in the way of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and righteouſneſs: And tho' it is truly "a crown of glory <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 16.31.</note>" to him that wears it, being found in this way; yet we cannot, even then, look upon it as a crown of glory, equal to that of wiſdom and piety on the head of youth, where there is commonly nothing found but folly and extravagance, but vain and wicked imaginations.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER reaſon, why early wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and virtue are particularly pleaſing to the wiſe and good, is, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe an eminent degree of perfection in more advanced life. They delight, not only by their preſent appearance, but by the proſpect which they afford; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that he who is, even in youth a ſaint, will in age be in the foremoſt rank of ſuch, and a diſtinguiſhed bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his day; agreeably to what was ſaid in the laſt preceeding diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the progreſſive nature of virtue and religion. All good men have the intereſt of the common-wealth, and of the church of Chriſt, nearly at heart: To both which, ſuch examples of early virtue bode good; eſpecially if found
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:008667_0209_102fb07a29ceed38"/>
in thoſe, who, by their birth, fortune and quality, are likely to act in ſome public ſphere, where their influence will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive. The tree which is remarkably flouriſhing in its youth, promiſes in due time, if not cut down, to ſpread its boughs far and wide; to afford, at once, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of fruit, an ample ſhade from the ſcorching ſun, and a covert from the ſtorm. In like manner does a youth of eminent virtue and accompliſhments, eſpecially in any of the higher ranks of life, bid fair to become at length, a great and diſtinguiſhed bleſſing, either to the church or the ſtate, or perhaps to both. It would therefore be a wonder, if wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and virtue in this early ſeaſon, did not afford a peculiar pleaſure to all good men; being at the ſame time, both a rare phaenomenon, and the earneſt of ſo much good to the world.</p>
            <p>AND now, if the young have any ſenſe of true honor, any ambition to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed highly by the wiſe and good; the path of glory is plain and open before them: Let them avoid the ſnares of vice, and reſiſt all her deceitful charms; let them conſecrate the beginning, by which they will, as it were, make all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of life, ſacred to God and virtue. Hereby they will acquire the
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:008667_0210_102fb07bb1528a88"/>
trueſt fame; that of doing good. They will begin life with honor: As it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they will ſtill grow in favour with God and man: They will alſo end life with glory; and even after death, their memory will ſtill be bleſſed, when all other fame would forſake them, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be turned into the fouleſt and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reproaches. For the very beſt that the wicked and impious can expect, is, that their name and memory ſhall rot!</p>
            <p>YOU ſhould now be aſhamed of that, which is in itſelf ſo ſhameful; and which will bring reproach in the latter end. You ſhould now be in love with that, which is in its own nature ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honorable; and which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you the higheſt renown at laſt. And here it will not be amiſs to remind you, that all vice in general, and ſome vices more particularly, are repreſented in ſcripture by the metaphors of impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, defilement, filthineſs, uncleanneſs, &amp;c. while, on the other hand, virtue and piety are expreſſed by the terms pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, cleanneſs of heart and hands, and the like: And "fine linnen, clean and white," is the ſcripture-emblem of the "righteouſneſs of the ſaints." The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theſe metaphors and emblems is, to make us abhor vice, as being foul,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:008667_0211_102fb07d6cac4b68"/>
loathſome, and diſgraceful to us; and to inſpire us with the love of true virtue, as being in its own nature moſt amiable, ornamental, and glorious. The young, eſpecially thoſe who are any ways diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their birth or fortune, are generally fond of appearing neat and clean, and well-dreſs'd; and indeed, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo in private, as well as appearing ſo in public: They would be quite aſhamed and diſconcerted, to be found in a dirty, ſlovenly dreſs. But how much more ambitious ought the young to be of that moral purity, which is the beauty and ornament of the ſoul? how much more aſhamed of that moral defilement, which makes it deformed and odious? I do not mean, ambitious of the one, or aſhamed of the other, only in company, or when the world beholds them; but in ſecret, even when no eyes are upon them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe, which are ſaid to be "as a flame of fire"; which
<q>run to and fro in the earth, beholding the evil and the good</q>;
equally beholding thoſe who, to uſe the language of ſcripture, have "defiled their garments," and "ſpotted them by the fleſh;" and thoſe, whoſe
<q>robes are waſhed, and made white in the blood of the Lamb.</q>
The apoſtle hints at ſome things that are
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:008667_0212_102fb07ef733baa8"/>
done in ſecret, ſo foul, that
<q>it is a ſhame even to ſpeak of them</q>.
How much more ſhameful is it then to practiſe them, tho' it be in ſecret? Nor, indeed, is there any thing now hid, which ſhall not be made manifeſt; yea, which is not already ſo to Him,
<q>with whom we have to do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>TO finiſh the firſt part of the preſent argument; tho' virtue is truly amiable and ornamental in all, it is moſt ſo in the young, in divers reſpects. Some of theſe have been ſpoken of already; and there is another which I ſhall juſt mention here: The paſſions, ſome of them more eſpecially, are naturally ſtronger in youth than in age; which conſideration doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs makes the conqueſt, or due regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, in that ſeaſon of life, the moſt honorable and glorious; far more ſo, than any other victory or triumph: For he that is "ſlow to anger," or reſtrains his other paſſions within due bounds,
<q>is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that taketh a city</q>.
Remember therefore, the counſel which David gave to Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, while young, tho' it ſeems the latter unhappily diſregarded it, till he was advanced in years.
<q>I was my father's ſon, ſays he, tender and only
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:008667_0213_102fb08727fd5da0"/>
beloved in the ſight of my mother. He taught me alſo, and ſaid unto me, Let thine heart retain my words — Wiſdom is the principal thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore get wiſdom; and with all thy getting, get underſtanding.</q>
               <q>Exalt her, and ſhe ſhall promote thee; ſhe ſhall bring thee to honor when thou doſt embrace her: She ſhall give to thine head an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of grace; a crown of gold ſhall ſhe deliver to thee <note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 4.3,—</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, in order the more effectually to diſſuade the young from delaying to ſerve God, or from continuing to ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures, till they are far advanced in years, and got, as it were, within the confines of death; I was, in the next place, more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remind them of the great odiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infamy of vice in maturer life. Whoever, being now young, determines not to be virtuous and pious, till he is advanced to middle, or old age, does, in effect, reſolve to be vicious and impious at that period of life; if not thro' it, yet, at leaſt, till he has enter'd upon it: A ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of life wherein, as was intimated, vice is much more odious and diſgraceful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more inexcuſeable, than it is in childhood and youth. By how much more amiable and praiſe-worthy virtue
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:008667_0214_102fb0892d6b3a50"/>
is in youth, than in old age, by ſo much more hateful and ſhameful is vice in old age, than in youth. And people of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection are almoſt as much ſtruck with horror in the latter caſe, as they are with pleaſure, and agreeable ſurprize, in the former. There is a real and juſt, tho' not an equal foundation in nature, for theſe different emotions of the mind, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by ſuch different objects as a young ſaint, and a veteran ſinner. I ſay, not an equal foundation; becauſe folly and vice are not ſo ſingular in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life, or even in old age, as wiſdom and virtue are in youth; and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar amiableneſs of the latter ariſes, in part, from the rarity of the thing, or its being ſo uncommon, as was obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. However, after allowing all that is proper, in reſpect of this diſparity in one circumſtance, I ſuppoſe all will readily grant in general, that an aged fool, blaſphemer, knave, or debauchee, is a much more contemptible and odious character, than a young one, altho', in this evil world, it is not ſo ſingular as a young man of wiſdom and virtue.</p>
            <p>ALTHO' vice in age is not ſo ſingular as virtue in youth, and therefore is not altogether ſo ſtriking; there is ſtill ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon why it ſhould be, as it is in
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:008667_0215_102fb08ab44b11d8"/>
the common apprehenſion of men, at leaſt of the wiſe and good, more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful in mature, than in early life. For it is, in that age or ſeaſon of life, precluded from availing itſelf of thoſe pleas, apologies and excuſes, which are generally made, and too generally allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in favour of vicious youth; ſuch as, want of time for reflection, the ſtrength of paſſion, inexperience, and the like. Theſe excuſes, tho' quite inſufficient, ought, doubtleſs, to have ſome weight, ſo as to extenuate the crimes and guilt of youth, in a degree: And they are often, tho' unjuſtly, urged, as if they, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, exempted youth from blame, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done in that age. How often is the exceſs of riot and licentiouſneſs, and even of prophaneneſs and impiety, juſtified, as it were, by theſe few words, or the like?—
<q>He is an inexperienced, thoughtleſs, young man.</q>
—And tho' candor is highly commendable, ſo far as there is room for it in reaſon; yet, ſurely, thoſe who make theſe, or ſuch-like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, on the follies and vices of youth, ought to reflect alſo, that vice is ſtill vice; that even the young have ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity ſufficient, and ought to know what it is, and to abſtain from it; and therefore, that they are not to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:008667_0216_102fb08e1bb73ed0"/>
by ſuch obſervations, which, I think, are never made in the holy ſcriptures, with the like view or deſign. The language of ſcripture is,
<q>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: But know thou, that for all theſe things, <hi>God will bring thee into judgment. Therefore remove ſorrow from thine heart, and put away evil from thy fleſh; for childhood and youth are vanity</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Eccl. 12.13, 14.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to return from what may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſeem a digreſſion; the greater the allowance is, which ought in reaſon to be made for vicious youth, as ſuch, the leſs ought in reaſon to be made for vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous age, as ſuch. And without fixing preciſely, bounds, limits and degrees, in this caſe (which is impoſſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abſurd to attempt,) we are much more naturally led to expect gravity, and ſobriety of mind and manners, in perſons come to mature life, than in the young. And therefore our ſurprize and horror are proportionably heightened, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſee the gray hairs of age, and all the folly, madneſs and licentiouſneſs of youth, united in the ſame perſons.— Their reaſon is preſumed to be long ſince
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:008667_0217_102fb093b180f940"/>
come to maturity; they have had time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or reflection and conſideration; they have had much experience, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary progreſs of things; many of their natural paſſions are of courſe ſubſided, in a degree; and temptation is leſſened. All which things, not only make vicious age appear, but actually renders it much more odious and contemptible, than vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious youth. Whatever apologies we make for the young, in the reſpects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned, to extenuate their faults and vices; we can make none of them in behalf of the aged; or thoſe who are, long ſince, arrived at the years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reflection: Eſpecially if they were favoured with a religious education in their youth; if they have always li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the light of the goſpel, and been frequently admoniſhed, both by the word and providences of God, to forſake their ſins, and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Such men, to be ſure, are left wholly without excuſe; yea, without any reaſonable apology, for their ſins. They have a double, a treble, yea, a tenfold ſhare of infamy and guilt, lying upon them: and are like that ground which the apoſtle James ſpeaks of, which, after long cultivation, bearing nothing but briars, and thorns, and weeds, is
<q>
                  <pb n="213" facs="unknown:008667_0218_102fb09537d53e50"/>nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LET the young think ſoberly of this: For youth and ſobriety are not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally enemies, or ſtrangers to each other, how ſeldom ſoever they may meet, and embrace as friends. Conſider the great ſhame and infamy that juſtly belong to impious and vicious perſons, even in middle, but eſpecially in old age. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that man, (for doubtleſs many ſuch are to be found) who, tho' he has enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many advantages of a religious nature, and is now paſt the meridian of his life, has never yet tho't ſoberly of his latter end, or of his duty to God, who gave, and preſerves his being. Reflect on ſuch a one as, almoſt daily, perhaps, transforms himſelf into a brute, by his intemperance: On another, whoſe mouth is ſtill filled with oaths and profanity: On a third, who, regardleſs of a treaſure in heaven, is ſet on getting earthly riches, not by right, but by fraud, and oppreſſion: On another, who is ſo eſtranged from the God of truth, that lying and falſhood are his delight: On another, who is ſtill intent on gratifying his fleſhly luſts, even after his fleſh, his body and, perhaps, his eſtate, are almoſt conſumed, by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries; ſo that he is become, not
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:008667_0219_102fb096c378e2b0"/>
only the ſcorn of the good, but even the ridicule and contempt of his former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in vice and guilt. Reflect on theſe, and ſuch-like characters, I ſay, which are common, and tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is not a peculiarly infamy juſtly belonging to them; I mean, in the old, or even middle age? If you are perſons of ſuch an ingenuous turn of mind, as this diſcourſe was more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly deſigned for, I am ſure you think, nothing can well be more odious or contemptible than ſuch men, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſtinguiſhed by their ſtation and circumſtances in life. For even an old, and fooliſh, and wicked king, is ſpoken of by Solomon, as a moſt deſpicable character; while that of a wiſe child is highly commended by him. Well: If ſuch perſons are juſtly the objects of great contempt; if they are deſpiſed by all wiſe men, and the all-wiſe God; are you willing to be like them, and ſo become objects of the ſame contempt and abhorrence yourſelves? as you will certainly be, if you ſhould delay to keep God's commandments, and perſevere in the practice of ſin and vice, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they have done. For, ſurely, you cannot flatter yourſelves, that tho' you ſhould act like them, tread in their ſteps,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:008667_0220_102fb09c9b8038e0"/>
and imitate their bad example, yet you ſhall avoid that juſt ignominy, which they have incurred. What can you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect, if you retain your vices and follies, till you are as far advanced in years as they, and under the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of like advantages, but to become as deſpicable and odious hereafter, as they are at preſent; and as you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they ought to be accounted? You cannot be ſo partial to yourſelves, and your own fame, as to entertain the leaſt hope, that the wiſe and good will honor you, if you ſhould grow old in thoſe vices and impieties, on account of which they deſpiſe others, become ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>To cloſe this part of the argument, therefore: If you have any ingenuous dread of the juſteſt infamy; if you would not incur the contempt of all wiſe and virtuous men; yea, if you would not be deſpiſed of God himſelf; do not entertain a thought of continuing to indulge your luſts, till you are more advanced in years. Turn your feet, even while you are young, into that good path, from which you will have no deſire to depart, when you are old: That path, in which you will have all the wiſe and good for your fellow-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:008667_0221_102fb09e21363e38"/>
from whom you will ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that honor which is infinitely more than a balance for the contempt, or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, of ten million vicious fools; that path of the juſt, which will
<q>ſhine more and more unto the perfect day:</q>
in fine, the path which will conduct you to that eternal kingdom and glory, to which you are called by Jeſus Chriſt.<note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it is time to proceed to the third branch of the preſent argument which is, That greater honor will redound, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to yourſelves, but to God and your Redeemer, by making haſte to keep the divine commandments, than by delaying this till you are farther advanced in life. It is one indication of an ingenuous mind, to be ready to give honor, to whom honor is due, as well as to merit it by worthy actions. God is pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himſelf honoured, by our love and obedience: our Saviour is alſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thereby. Nor om I willing to believe, there are many ſuch children of diſobedience here preſent, as have no ſenſe of any obligation lying upon them, to honor their Father who is in heaven; the God that made, that preſerves them, and who offers them the inheritance of children: this would ſuppoſe them to
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:008667_0222_102fb09faa4b9748"/>
be "baſtards and not ſons." Nor will I ſuppoſe it poſſible for you to entertain a doubt, whether you ought to honor ſo glorious a perſon, ſo great a benefactor as Jeſus Chriſt; who being rich, yet for your ſakes became poor; enduring the croſs, and deſpiſing the ſhame; and whom, being now, by the right hand of God exalted, we are all required to honor, to the glory of God the Father. To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that you can call in queſtion your obligation to glorify God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, would be to ſuppoſe you baſe and degenerate to a great degree; quite contrary to the principle I ſet out upon. It is therefore now taken for granted, that you own yourſelves under obligation, to give all the honor you poſſibly can, to thoſe who are ſo worthy of it.</p>
            <p>AND if you acknowledge this, let me aſk you, whether you know any other way, in which you can ſo truly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually honor God and your Redeemer, as by keeping the commandments? by living and acting as God and Jeſus Chriſt require you to do? Our Saviour ſays,
<q>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; ſo ſhall ye be my diſciples.</q>
And again:
<q>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</q>
You
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:008667_0223_102fb0a2f40d1e78"/>
ſee then, that you will, by doing thus, the moſt effectually glorify God, and ſhew your regard to Jeſus Chriſt. Is it not therefore incumbent upon you, even now, however young you may be, to turn your feet unto God's teſtimonies; to make haſte, and not delay, to keep his commandments? Would you not do more honor to him that made, and him that redeemed you by his blood, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering on a life of religion now, than by doing it hereafter when you are old, if perhaps, you ſhould live to become ſo? If God is at all honored by the obedience of his creatures, certainly they who keep his commandments thro' the whole courſe of their lives, honor him more than they, who neglect to do ſo, till their lives are almoſt come to a period.</p>
            <p>THAT you may be the more fully convinced of this, and plainly ſee, how much more God and our Saviour are glorified, by an early, than by a late converſion to the ways of wiſdom, I ſhall here briefly ſet them in contraſt; firſt repreſenting to you the caſe and character of One, who even in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> morning of life remembers his creator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſerves him faithfully thro' life; and then, of One, who delays his return to God, till age has almoſt put a period to
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:008667_0224_102fb0a4811a8ff0"/>
his days. There will be nothing very peculiar, or ſingular, in theſe characters; either with reſpect to the outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and circumſtances to the perſons ſuppoſed, or with reſpect to the manner and means of their being reclaimed from the error of their ways, to the wiſdom of the juſt; which would not ſo well anſwer the propoſed end, of general uſe.</p>
            <p>FIRST then, Here is One, who, even in early youth, by a chriſtian education, has deep impreſſions of religion made on his heart: And tho' he has not been more vicious than children commonly are, yet his conſcience is awakened and troubled, ſo that he is inquiſitive
<q>what he ſhall do to be ſaved?</q>
He ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects that paſſage in the goſpel—
<q>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt: Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, &amp;c.</q>
He is further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and encouraged, by the conduct and words of Him, who took even chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren up in his arms and bleſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, ſaying,
<q>Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven.</q>
He reſolves, that if he has done iniquity, he will do ſo no more; but from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, by God's aſſiſtance, devote
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:008667_0225_102fb0a7622ecb20"/>
himſelf to his ſervice, and keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of his Redeemer. He not only reſolves; but puts his good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in practice. He immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces all the vanities of childhood and youth: And has ſo firm a belief of things inviſible and eternal, as enables him to vanquiſh all temptations. He is a conqueror, while but a child: And being come to years, would, like Moſes, rather ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, and be called
<q>the ſon of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah's daughter.</q>
He perſiſts in this courſe of piety and virtue, ſo early be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, thro' the ſeveral ſtages of life, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding every oppoſition and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. He worſhips God in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth, according to his word and inſtitutions, without enthuſiaſm, or oſtentation. He adorns the doctrine of God his Saviour in all things: He is a uſeful member of ſociety; and in every relation of life, from youth to age, acts a part becoming a chriſtian; living the life which he lives in the fleſh, by the faith of the Son of God, who, he know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will at length come to "be glorified i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his ſaints." His wiſdom and piety are ſtill improved by years: The longer he lives, the more perfect he becomes; and,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:008667_0226_102fb0ad5d84bb70"/>
at length, in a good old age, dies in the Lord, having his
<q>hope full of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;</q>
and gloriouſly anticipating, hereby, his final triumph over the grave.</p>
            <p>REFLECT a little on this character, wherein there is nothing romantic; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over-done, or carried beyond real life; tho', it is confeſſed, it is far from being ſo common as were to be deſired. The propoſed contraſt thereto, follows.</p>
            <p>HERE then, is another perſon, born and educated, like the former, in a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian country, and in a chriſtian manner; if you pleaſe, his co-temporary, and neighbour: But how unlike him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects! For tho' "from a child he has known the holy ſcriptures, which were able to make him wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," he practically diſregarded them till he became a man, yea, old and grey-headed. His childhood and youth were wholly given to vanity. He was never a ſpeculative unbeliever; but yet, while young, intirely addicted himſelf to thoſe "fleſhly luſts, which war againſt the ſoul." When paſt the meridian of his days, ſchemes of worldly ambition, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wealth, took poſſeſſion of his heart; and chiefly employ'd his thoughts. In proſecuting theſe, he ſtuck at none of the uſual methods of intrigue, falſhood
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:008667_0227_102fb0af1dab3ae8"/>
and calumny, of craft, oppreſſion and fraud: Tho' ſtill, to prevent the loſs of his reputation in a chriſtian country, he uſed often to attend the public worſhip; and was heard, more than once, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs himſelf with ſeeming warmth, not only againſt our modern infidels; but againſt others, whom popular cenſure calls innovators in religion, or men of unſound and dangerous principles. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by a ſeries of follies, vices and crimes, whereby he did much miſchief in the world; and in which he grew ſtill more hardened and audacious with years, he made it evident to all who knew his practices, how little he feared God, or regarded man; or rather, how much he contemned both. But being now far advanced in life; having been diſappointed in moſt of his worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; finding the infirmities of age come faſt upon him; being apprehenſive that, according to the courſe of nature, death was at hand; reflecting on the greatneſs of his guilt, and fearing the wrath to come; being alſo alarmed by ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening diſpenſations of providence, he determines at length to reform his ways; and to do whatever he can, in the cloſe of life, to ſave his ſoul. God, who is long-ſuffering, and rich in mercy
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:008667_0228_102fb0b0a3f304a8"/>
to them that call upon him, regards his prayers. He is born again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a new man in his old age. He lives a little while after; juſt long enough to make charitable people believe, he is a true penitent; and ſo he dies; not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the full aſſurance of faith; nor yet without a degree of hope, that he ſhall not be "condemned with the world."</p>
            <p>THIS is the man, or character, which you are deſired to compare with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; a common character, excepting the latter part of it: For I own, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual for thoſe, who have ſo long lived the life of the wicked, at laſt to
<q>die the death of the righteous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>YOU cannot reaſonably make it a doubt, by which of theſe two perſons God was moſt glorified. The former glorified him, and was a credit to religion, from childhood to youth, from youth to mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle age, from middle age to old; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in death; ſtill making it manifeſt how great a regard he had for God and his laws. The latter, on the contrary, was a diſgrace to the chriſtian profeſſion; and thro' him,
<q>the name of God was blaſphemed <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 2.24.</note>
               </q>
by many. How many altars did he raiſe to luſt, ambition, and mammon, the only deities to which he ſacrificed, before ever he ſeriouſly tho't
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:008667_0229_102fb0b867dda488"/>
of giving glory to God? He plainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the ſervice of Satan, to that of God moſt high, till he was almoſt paſt ſerving the former any longer, by reaſon of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's decay, and the near approach of death. He could not, even at laſt, be ſo properly ſaid to have voluntarily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken his ſins, and returned to God, as compell'd to do it, by the extremity of his condition. And if he glorified God at all, it was chiefly by being an example of his long-ſuffering, and grace, in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and converſion, after having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored and affronted him ſo many years, by ſuch a life.</p>
            <p>A MORE particular compariſon was intended between theſe two characters; in order to ſhow, how much more honor accrues to God and our Redeemer by the former, than by the latter of them. But as there is hardly time for it, ſo it is hoped, it is not neceſſary. After laying the characters before you, your own reaſon, your own juſt ſenſe of things, will ſave me this labour; for, in your judgment, I am ſure, you cannot heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a moment, however you may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in point of inclination.</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt not cloſe this diſcourſe, without briefly ſumming up the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; without drawing, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,

the practical concluſion from the whole.</p>
            <p>YOU will remember then, that I am not now ſpeaking to perſons of a flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abandoned character; nor even to thoſe who are naturally of a dull and ſordid diſpoſition, almoſt all body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſoul or ſpirit: but to ingenuous youth, who have a lively ſenſe of honor, of propriety and decorum, with their contraries; and who would be aſhamed to act a part, evidently baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in their own apprehenſions. Now you have ſeen, by what has been ſaid above, that religion, being a reaſonable ſervice, is in itſelf becoming and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in all perſons, at all times. You have ſeen that it is, in divers reſpects, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly amiable and reputable in youth. You have ſeen what particular infamy attends, and juſtly belongs to vicious age. And, laſtly, you have ſeen, how much more honor is done to God and our Redeemer, whom we are all bound to honor, by thoſe who early devote themſelves to the ſervice of God, than by thoſe who ſerve the devil and their luſts, till age overtakes them. What, now, is the plain conſequence from theſe premiſes? Doubtleſs, That you ought to make haſte, and not delay, to
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:008667_0231_102fb0bc0232a328"/>
turn your feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keep his commandments. If you would acquire the moſt ſubſtantial glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if you would avoid the juſteſt and greateſt infamy; if you would, as much as in you lies, do honor to God that made, and to Chriſt that redeemed you; if you would do all, or any of theſe things, you are immediately to forſake your fooliſh and vicious practices, and to live henceforward, in the faith and fear of God, in obedience to his holy will.</p>
            <p>AND what more forcible argument, or motive than this, could be uſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade perſons of your ingenuous and generous temper, to be ſpeedy in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your feet unto God's teſtimonies? What others need I urge? What others need I ſo much as mention? Need I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you, how precarious life is; and that you may very ſoon and unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called out of this world, to give an account of yourſelves to God? Need I tell you, that it will be far more irkſome and difficult to reform your evil ways hereafter, than to do it now, even "while it is called to-day?" Need I tell you, that you will be far more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in this world, in the practice of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than you can poſſibly be, in the
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:008667_0232_102fb0bf0c02ef98"/>
indulgence of your luſts? Need I aſſure you, that there is a peculiar and great reward, laid up in heaven for thoſe, who faithfully ſerve God from the morning to the eye of life? Need I ſuggeſt to you, what bold and preſumptuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety it is, to perſiſt in diſobeying God's commandments, while his wrath is ſo clearly
<q>revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men?</q>
Need I mention any thing of the terrors of the Lord? Any thing, of that "rod of iron," with which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, irreclaimable ſinners, are to be ruled, or rather,
<q>daſhed to pieces like a potter's veſſel?</q>
Any thing, of that
<q>fire prepared for the devil and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</q>
into which the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity are to be caſt? Any thing of that
<q>outer darkneſs, where there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth</q>?</p>
            <p>IS there any need to inſiſt on, or even to mention, ſuch topics and motives as theſe, in order to perſwade perſons of your taſte and temper, to make haſte, and not delay? No, ſurely! they are calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for perſons of a very different make; naturally void of ingenuity, or deeply immerſed already in vice and impiety. With you, the argument of this diſcourſe will ſupply the place of all others: You
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:008667_0233_102fb0c4eac24a00"/>
covet true, ſubſtantial glory: You dread deſerved infamy: You would, to the utmoſt of your power, do honor to your great and good Creator, to your merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Redeemer. And being now convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that in order to theſe ends, you muſt forſake your ſins, and keep God's commandments, you will doubtleſs make haſte, and not delay. You are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that you will not offend any more; that you will no longer violate the ſacred laws of right reaſon, honor and gratitude, by with-holding your hearts, your love and obedience, from Him, to whom they are ſo juſtly due. You are now reſolved, that before your eyes are cloſed with ſleep, they ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow with tears of ingenuous peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and godly ſorrow, while you implore forgiveneſs thro' Him, who was "once offered to bear the ſins of many;" and beſeech God, without whom you can, effectually, do nothing, to give you "a new heart;" to guide, and keep you, in the paths of righteouſneſs and peace. It can hardly be doubted, but theſe are your preſent intentions and reſolutions; do not, I beſeech you, forget, but put them, in practice; that ſo, thro' the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant goodneſs of God, that ſame ſun, which to-day aroſe on you,
<q>evil and
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:008667_0234_102fb0c68e99e658"/>
unthankful,</q>
may to-morrow ariſe on you, juſt and juſtified; and ſuch as ſhall themſelves, at length,
<q>ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdom of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</q>!</p>
            <p>YOUR youth, and your turn of mind, leave ſome room for candor to hope, that your neglecting hitherto, what would be ſo reputable to yourſelves, and contribute ſo much to the honor of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to the glory of God and your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, is rather owing to want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and reflection, than to any thing worſe; tho' that, indeed, is itſelf highly blameable. Surely, you did not well conſider in what true glory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; you did not duly reflect, Whoſe commandments you violated! Whoſe Son you "trod under foot"! Whoſe blood you "accounted an unholy thing!" Whoſe good Spirit you "grieved"! Had you thoroughly thought of theſe things, doubtleſs you would, before this time, have turned your feet unto God's teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Wherefore, being now ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly reminded of them, let them have their proper influence on your hearts; and depart not from the holy commandment delivered to you.

<pb n="232" facs="unknown:008667_0237_102fb0d1632aaf80"/>
pleaſures of a religious life, or the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing reward laid up in heaven, for thoſe who attain to an high degree of chriſtian perfection: Whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peculiar amiableneſs of virtue in youth, the peculiar infamy of vice in age, or the great honor that is done to God and our Redeemer, by conſecrating the morning of our lives to religion: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider all, or any of theſe things, I ſay, ſtill the practical concluſion will be the ſame; viz. That it becomes us to make haſte to keep God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; and that all delay herein is utterly inexcuſable. Theſe ſeveral to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, or heads of argument, having been dilated upon in ſome of the laſt preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſes, are now paſſed over with a bare mention.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER argument is, by divine aſſiſtance to be handled in this diſcourſe, with the ſame general view: And this ſhall be taken from a conſideration of the baſeneſs, the black ingratitude, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in our ſins, while God allows us a ſpace for repentance, and ſhews ſo much grace, pity and condeſcention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, as appear in the goſpel of his Son.</p>
            <p>THIS argument has ſome affinity with that of the foregoing diſcourſe, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to operate on the ſame tempers,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:008667_0238_102fb0d30fa44d90"/>
or perſons of a like diſpoſition and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, with the former: I mean on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have ſome ingenuity of mind; ſome ſenſe of honor and decorum; and who, tho' of a vicious character, are not yet abandoned — Not on thoſe, who are of a ſervile and ſordid diſpoſition, or who are already hardned to a great degree in vice and impiety. Theſe latter, equally regardleſs of God's honor, and of their own, would perhaps only ſmile at our ſimplicity, if we ſhould attempt to work upon them by ſuch airy notions, and empty ſpeculations, as theſe are in their groſs apprehenſions. But there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, at leaſt ſome, of a more ingenuous temper, who will feel a divine power and energy even in arguments of this kind; airy and unſubſtantial, only in the conceptions of thoſe, who are either naturally of a fordid make, or who are plunged deep in vice and ſenſuality, That any particular action, or courſe of life, is ungrateful, that it is baſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous, will be a conſideration of great weight, even with many who are not of a virtuous character. And, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, there is no ingratitude ſo baſe and infamous, as that of perſevering in diſobedience to God's commandments, conſidering his goodneſs, forbearance,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:008667_0239_102fb0d4957d5f90"/>
and long-ſuffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing towards us, and his grace revealed in the goſpel of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THE preſent argument may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and enforced under the following obſervations; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT God allows thoſe who have gone aſtray from his commandments, a ſpace for repentance, that they may be reconciled to him, and happy in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor:</p>
            <p>THAT he has given his own dear ſon to ſuffer and die for us:</p>
            <p>THAT he condeſcends to invite, and, as it were, to intreat and beſeech ſinners, to be reconciled to him:</p>
            <p>THAT this is the moſt aſtoniſhing goodneſs and condeſcention in him:</p>
            <p>THAT it is, therefore, the baſeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude in us to perſevere in our ſins from time to time: And conſequently,</p>
            <p>THAT if we have any ingenuity of temper, or any ſenſe of honor, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to make haſte, and not delay, to keep the commandments of our God: Which is the great point in view.</p>
            <p>I muſt of neceſſity be ſhort upon theſe particulars, ſince the compaſs of one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will not admit of any great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement on them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="unknown:008667_0240_102fb0d7adc18810"/>To return therefore: GOD allows thoſe who have gone aſtray from his commandments, a ſpace for repentance, that they may return to him, and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his favor. We are all of us the witneſſes and monuments of this his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, mercy and forbearance. We doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs began early to depart from the living God, and to break his commandments; for "childhood and youth are vanity". And ſome of us have, perhaps, been walking in vicious courſes, even till old age has overtaken us therein: All which time, God has been waiting to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. So that he not only allows a ſpace for repentance to ſinners in general, that they may make their peace with him, by turning their feet unto his teſtimonies; but to ſome of them, he allows a long time for this purpoſe; if, indeed, human life can ever be called long. And to be ſure, half this term may well be looked upon as long, for the great and holy God to wait on his ſinful, rebellious creatures, while he beholds them trampling on his laws; that they may ſee, and repent of their wicked deeds. For this is the end and deſign of his forbearing thus with them. Were he not pitiful and gracious he would ſpeedily execute his righteous ſentence againſt the evil works of men,
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:008667_0241_102fb0de275146f0"/>
inſtead of delaying it in the manner he does. In the language of the apoſtle Peter, He is "long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh; but that all ſhould come to repentance".</p>
            <p>GOD might, indeed, be ſaid to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and long-ſuffering, tho' he allow'd ſinners only the ſpace of two or three years to think on their ways, and turn their feet unto his teſtimonies. Are there many earthly monarchs, who exerciſe ſuch forbearance towards their unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and rebellious ſubjects, having all the time full power to make them feel the due deſert of their crimes? To be ſure, we do not often ſee ſuch examples of lenity and forbearance in the poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of this world. God's conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in this reſpect, fully verifies his own words: "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. <note n="a" place="margin">Iſai. 55.8, 9.</note> This is ſaid with particular reference to the patience and mercy of God towards ſinners; which ſo far exceeds that of men one towards another, who are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſty, and almoſt inſatiable, in aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themſelves on their enemies. God
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:008667_0242_102fb0dfad2c83a0"/>
might make his power known, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify his juſtice, in puniſhing our ſins as ſoon as committed. But he had rather that we would turn and live; having no pleaſure in the death of the wicked. He had rather make his mercy appear illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious and glorious, by forbearing with us in our ſins for a time, and then pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them upon our repentance, than ſhew his righteous ſeverity, by cutting us off in our treſpaſſes, without allowing us a ſeaſon to reflect on our ways, and reform them. How backward he is to deſtroy the wicked, and his great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards them, we may further learn from what he ſaid to Ephraim and Iſrael of old, [Hoſ. xi.] "My people are bent to backſliding from me—How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee Iſrael? how ſhall I make thee as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? my heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger; I will not return to deſtroy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim: For I am God and not man; the holy One in the midſt of thee." Impenitent ſinners in general may here ſee the reaſon, why they are not yet cut off and deſtroyed: It is not, becauſe they have not deſerved to be thus dealt with;
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:008667_0243_102f7500f96b62f8"/>
but becauſe they have to do with that God whoſe mercy is infinite; and his forbearance unexampled amongſt men.</p>
            <p>BUT it will give us a ſtill more exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted idea of God's goodneſs and grace, if, in the next place, we reflect, That he has given his own dear Son to ſuffer and die for us. So greatly has God loved this ſinful world! So unwilling is he, that we ſhould periſh! So deſirous, to ſpeak after the manner of men, that we ſhould obtain eternal life! In the language of the apoſtle Paul, "God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them"— "For he hath made him to be ſin [a ſin-offering] for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him." And again: "God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love towards us, ſaith he, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us." So the apoſtle John: "In this was manifeſted the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the world; that we might live thro' him. Herein is love; not that we loved God, but that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and ſent his Son to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins."</p>
            <p>AND now, adhering to the Scripture-phraſe, could the love of God have been
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:008667_0244_102fb0e2c0e48400"/>
ſo <hi>manifeſted</hi> to a guilty world, in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, as it is in this? He loved us, indeed, anticedendy to Chriſt's coming into the world, and even antecedently to his deſignation to the mediatorial of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. For this appointment itſelf took its riſe from the love, and free grace of God; being the effect, not the cauſe thereof. And it was herein, that God's eternal love was made manifeſt, viſible, or evident to mankind; <hi>viz.</hi> in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſending his Son into the world, in the fulneſs of time; a perſon of ſuch excellence and dignity, and ſo beloved by him, here to live a life of ſorrow, and die a ſhameful and accurſed death, in order to reconcile us unto himſelf, and "bring many ſons unto glory." Taking it for granted, that God had a moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and tender love for us, and concern for our eternal happineſs; taking this for granted, I ſay, aſk yourſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you can conceive of any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, in which he could ſo effectually have ſhown, and demonſtrated this to the world, as that which he has actually taken to this end? Abraham manifeſted his great piety, in being ready to part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with his only ſon Iſaac, at the call of God, when he was pleaſed to make that trial of his ſincerity: "Now know I
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:008667_0245_102fb0ea9d86e620"/>
that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not with-held thy ſon, thine <hi>only</hi> ſon, from me." <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 22.12.</note> This was the ſtrongeſt teſtimony, the higheſt evidence, he could poſſibly give of his ſincenty, conſidering the great love which he had for his ſon. In alluſion to which ſtory, we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, Now know we that God loveth us indeed, ſeeing he hath not with-held his Son, his only Son from us. And he that ſpared not his own Son, in whom he ſo much delighted, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo, freely give us all things? How ſtrong is that love? How great is that mercy? How rich is that grace, which has, in this way, been manifeſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us? Doubtleſs this is the ſtrongeſt evidence, the higheſt proof, which God could give, of his compaſſion and mercy to the ſinful children of men. I am ſure, you cannot conceive of any greater, more convincing, affecting, or aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>AND you know that the Son of God was manifeſted to take away our ſins, not only by bearing them in his own body on the tree, but by delivering us from the power and dominion thereof; that we might be purified unto him, a peculiar people, zealous of good works;
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:008667_0246_102fb0ecaa12b0e0"/>
and ſerve God in holineſs and in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs all the days of our lives. Can we then make too much haſte? or, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can we poſſibly make haſte enough, to co-operate with the deſigns of God's love in Chriſt Jeſus, by turning our feet unto his teſtimonies? How ungrateful are we to him, as well as unkind to ourſelves, if we make any delay to keep his commandments?</p>
            <p>BUT it is farther to be obſerved, That God condeſcends moſt earneſtly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, I had almoſt ſaid, to intreat and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech us, to be reconciled to him, as tho' his own happineſs depended upon our's. "We then, as ambaſſadors for Chriſt, ſays the apoſtle, as tho' God did <hi>beſeech</hi> you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled unto God." What aſtoniſhing language is this!— "Look unto the heavens, and ſee, and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. If thou ſinneſt, what doſt thou againſt him? Or if thy tranſgreſſions be multiplied, what doſt thou unto him? If thou be righteous what giveſt thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?" <note n="c" place="margin">Job 35.5,—8.</note> And yet the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends, as it were, to intreat and beſeech us; ſaying, "Turn ye, turn ye; for
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:008667_0247_102fb0ee549001f0"/>
why will ye die?" As if it were not enough for the great God, whom we have offended by our ſins, to give us a ſpace and opportunity to make our peace with him; as if it were not enough for him, to have delivered up his own Son for us all; as if it were not enough for him, by his prophets and apoſtles, to proclaim to us his willingneſs to receive us into his favor, on our return to him: As if all this were not enough, I ſay, the great Lord of all does, as it were, condeſcend to become Himſelf a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and ſupplicant, to his ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: He invites, hc perſuades, he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us, to return to him, and be happy, with more apparent tenderneſs and ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, than any earthly parent would invite a rebellious and prodigal ſon to return, and receive the inheritance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for him.</p>
            <p>WHY does God uſe ſo many perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and intreaties, in order to effect a reconciliation, and to eſtabliſh peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himſelf and us? Is this, becauſe he was the aggreſſor, the offending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to whom it of right belongeth to be firſt in an overture to this end, and to make ſupplication? No: He had done us no wrong, but great good; which we requited with evil. Did he fear any
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:008667_0248_102fb0f166bd7330"/>
harm would accrue to him, from our continued oppoſition to him, and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt him? No: He is far exalted above the reach of our impotent mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and could utterly deſtroy us with one breath of his mouth. Did he expect to receive any benefit to himſelf, as the effect of this reconciliation? any aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of his perfections, or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? No: We are as unable to do him good, as harm; and are abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon his pleaſure, both for happineſs, and our very being. Does he think he ſhould be left deſtitute of ſubjects to reign over, if he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually deſtroy, inſtead of reclaiming us to our allegiance? No: Tho' mankind were deſtroyed from the earth, there are millions of glorious angels in heaven, that delight in doing his will; and he could eaſily re-people this earth with other inhabitants: There is more <hi>duſt,</hi> out of which to form them; and the ſame <hi>breath</hi> that animated us, whereby "man became a living ſoul <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note>," is not yet exhauſted! What then is the reaſon of God's dealing thus with us? Why does he uſe intreaties? Why is he ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of reconciling this wicked and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate world unto himſelf? Why exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſo much forbearance towards us?
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:008667_0249_102fb0e134561628"/>
The only reaſon hereof is, that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely good, merciful and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and is not willing we ſhould periſh, how much ſoever we have deſerved it.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole then, the goodneſs and condeſcention of God towards his ſinful creatures, are, as was ſaid above, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt aſtoniſhing, that we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conceive of. If we duly conſider the greatneſs and majeſty of God, our own littleneſs and vileneſs; and what it is for ſuch worms of the duſt to tranſgreſs his laws; we may well be ſurpriſed, that he does not immdiately tread upon us, and cruſh us into the duſt again, out of which we were taken; I mean, upon our firſt riſing up in oppoſition to his will. Is it not ſtrange, that he ſhould allow us any ſpace at all for repentance? If it is not; yet, ſurely, it is ſurprizing, that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace ſhould be protracted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us from year to year, to ſuch long-ſuffering. We ſee no grace, no lenity, no forbearance amongſt men, which, all circumſtances being duly conſidered, will bear any compariſon with this: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when we reflect, that God ſtill offers us, not only the forgiveneſs of our paſt offences, but eternal life and glory. But our admiration of his goodneſs and mercy, muſt needs be ſtill heightened,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:008667_0250_102f7502c4685b60"/>
by reflecting on that particular method, in which he has manifeſted this his mercy and grare to us; the method which he has choſen for our redemption from ſin, and miſery, and to bring us to glory. Did ever any earthly ſovereign, from meer pity and compaſſion to his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, ill-deſerving ſubjects, deliver up an only begotten, and well-beloved ſon, to ſuffer and die in their room, as a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for them, that they might live, and yet the honor of his laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be maintained? There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuch condeſcention and grace, but in almighty God, the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, towards us, when we were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER; allowing for the preſent, that we could call to mind ſomething ſimilar hereto, in the conduct of certain earthly potentates towards their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubjects; yet can we recollect an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any king's continuing to iſſue out acts of grace, from year to year, in favour of his rebel-ſubjects, after having once given them ſuch a proof of his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and goodneſs; ſtill inviting them to return to their duty and allegiance, and to accept his mercy? Can we think of any examples of thoſe, who in ſuch a caſe have become, as it were, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:008667_0251_102fafba5ae3e558"/>
to their diſloyal and traiterous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, praying and beſeeching them for a long courſe of time, to lay aſide their unreaſonable oppoſition, and to ſubmit themſelves? Tho' it muſt be ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that this was not for the injured monarch's, but for their own advantage; and that, all this time, he had ſufficient power, and might with the greateſt eaſe, as well as juſtice, have avenged himſelf on them: For otherwiſe the caſes will not be parallel. I am ſure you cannot call to remembrance any ſuch examples of goodneſs and condeſcention, in the kings and potentates of this world.</p>
            <p>BUT altho' you could do ſo, ſtill you will allow that there is ſome difference between them, and the king eternal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and inviſible, the only wiſe God; ſome difference between mens rebelling againſt thoſe, who are weak and mortal creatures as well as themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt the King of heaven; ſome difference between the former's ſtooping to intreat their unreaſonable ſubjects to be reconciled to them, and God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching us to be reconciled to Him: So that, after all, there is, and muſt be, a very wide and eſſential difference between the two caſes. There neither are, not can in nature be, any examples of grace or
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:008667_0252_102fafbbe735a4b8"/>
condeſcention among men, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards each other, however great in appearance, which will, on due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, come up in any meaſure to that which God exerciſes towards his ſinful creatures. All ſuch examples muſt, of neceſſity, fall infinitely ſhort; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely below the divine pattern and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; becauſe God is infinitelv greater than man. We cannot, therefore, as I ſaid before, even conceive of any other goodneſs, grace and condeſcention, ſo great and aſtoniſhing, as that which God has manifeſted towards us, in allowing us a ſeaſon for repentance; in giving his Son to die for us; in waiting ſo long with us; and in thus intreating us to be at peace with him. As the heavens are high above the earth, ſo does the grace of Him, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, exceed all other grace and goodneſs: "There is none good but One: that is God."</p>
            <p>FROM whence it clearly follows, as was ſaid before, that it is the baſeſt, the blackeſt ingratitude in us, to perſevere in our ſins againſt him from time to time, that can be conceived of. For if we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy and urworthily treat any one, who has dealt well and kindly by us, our baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ingratitude are always in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:008667_0253_102fafc4006b0e40"/>
to the degree of his goodneſs to us, and the obligations which he has laid us under. So that if there is none ſo good and gracious to us as God, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be guilty of ſo great and ſoul ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards any other, as we are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of towards him, in continuing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe and affront him with our unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deeds, inſtead of being led to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by his goodneſs. This is ſuch a conduct as is, to the laſt degree, ſordid and ſhameful. It is making the moſt unſuitable return to the moſt aſtoniſhing kindneſs, to the greateſt obligations which the beſt and greateſt of all beings could lay us under. Has the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth eternity; he, whoſe word gave being to all worlds, and whoſe breath could, in a moment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce both us and them to nothing; has he ſhown ſo much goodneſs, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention towards us? has he given us an opportunity to make our peace with him? has he delivered up his own Son for us all? has he given us the offer of eternal life and ſalvation? does he condeſcend to become a petitioner, as it were, to the duſt of his footſtool, even to us ſinful duſt and aſhes?—And do we refuſe to hearken to him? do we heſitate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay? do we practically ſay to him, "Wait

our leiſure; continue to invite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat us to be reconciled to thee: perhaps we may hear and grant thy requeſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when by thy importunity thou haſt wearied us, or we are weary of our ſins!" Be aſtoniſhed, O heavens! at ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude as this! that the children which God has nouriſhed, and brought up with ſo much care and tenderneſs, ſhould rebel againſt him; and not only rebel againſt him, but perſevere in doing ſo, even while he intreats them to return to him, and be eternally happy! Was there ever, on one hand, ſuch goodne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, ſuch grace and condeſcention! Was there ever, on the other hand, ſuch ingratitude, ſuch diſingenuity, ſuch baſeneſs as this!</p>
            <p>WHAT would you think of children who ſhould act ſuch a part as this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an earthly parent; I mean, as far as the caſe admits of a parallel? What would you think of men who ſhould act thus towards an earthly ſovereign? of thoſe who, inſtead of being won over to their duty and allegiance by his grace and forbearance, and the greateſt poſſible teſtimonies of his kind regards, ſhould continue to abuſe his patience; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe in their enmity againſt him and his government, than be, in any meaſure, reconciled to either? would not
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:008667_0255_102fafc749443910"/>
you, would not all think, that they who thus deſpiſed the goodneſs, forbearance, and long-ſuffering of their lawful ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, were in nature monſters, rather than men? Would you not think, that they were ſo far from having the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ingenuous tempers, becoming rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, that they were deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed below humanity? yea, even below the dull ox, and the ſtill more ſtupid aſs? For the former is ſaid to "know his owner," and the latter, "his maſters crib:" theſe animals are not wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, who it is that uſes them with kindneſs; and they obey his commands, making him the returns of their ſervice. —Now might I not ſay to him, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres in his diſobedience to God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, notwithſtanding his great goodneſs and grace, as repreſented above, "Thou art the man"? or rather, Thou art that no-man, that baſe and ſordid creature in human ſhape, to which thou art a diſgrace? For the man, if we may call him by ſo reſpectable a name, who acts ſuch a part towards his Maker, his God, his Father, his all gracious Sovereign, acts a part infinitely more ungrateful, more diſengenuous and vile, than it is poſſible for any one to act tow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ds the beſt earthly parent, or ſovereign: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:008667_0256_102fafcc835e0f80"/>
God is infinitely greater, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he has ſhown infinitely more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and condeſcention to us, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more worthy to be lov'd and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd. Our vileneſs and ingratitude, if we perſiſt in our diſobedience to him, muſt bear exactly the ſame proportion to their's, who perſiſt in their diſobedience to a good parent or king, that God's greatneſs, power, and goodneſs, bear to the greatneſs, power and goodneſs of our earthly fathers or ſovereigns: i. e. it muſt be infinitely greater; and ſo can, ſtrictly ſpeaking, bear no compariſon at all therewith. This, as far as I am able to ſee, is a true and juſt ſtate of the caſe, deſtitute of all falſe colouring and gloſſing. If God is infinitely greater in himſelf, and infinitely better to us, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being is, or can be; our ingratitude to him, in continuing to rebel againſt him, muſt of conſequence be infinitely more ſordid and baſe, than any we can poſſibly be guilty of, towards any other benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whether friend, parent or king; whether man, or miniſtring angel. The latter is as certain as the former; its truth being plainly and neceſſarily connected therewith. So that we muſt either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny God to be infinitely greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that any other being, or elſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:008667_0257_102fafcf8386f828"/>
that to diſobey hin, and abuſe his goodneſs and grace, is infinitely the blackeſt and vileſt ingratitude, that can be conceived. And as I am perſwaded, none of you deny, or in the leaſt doubt, the former; ſo, I hope, you will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own the latter.</p>
            <p>THE practical concluſion from the whole, therefore, and the ſum of the preſent argument, is this; That if we have any ingenuity of mind, or any ſenſe of honor, it becomes us to make haſte, and not delay to keep the commandments of our God. It is now taken for granted, that you, for whom this diſcourſe is more eſpecially deſigned, would not willingly be thought baſe and ſordid in your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſpoſition; that you would not lie under the reproach and infamy, of having treated a benefactor ill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited him evil for good, even tho' you were never to incur any other harm thereby, than to be juſtly accounted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous and baſe. It is taken for granted, that you have at leaſt ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of native generoſity; ſome ſenſe of honor; ſo that you would be aſhamed to requite your parents, or beſt earthly friends, after ſuch a manner, that all the world might juſtly think and ſpeak of you, as perſons of a ſordid and brutiſh
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:008667_0258_102fafd29f263670"/>
temper, or, in one word, ungrateful. If you would not be aſhamed of this, you are not the perſons to whom the preſent diſcourſe is chiefly directed. It is, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, now taken for granted, that you believe God is your greateſt benefactor, your beſt friend; that he waits to be gracious to you; that he has given his own Son to die for your redemption from ſin and death; that he invites you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of eternal life; and that he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends even to intreat you to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto him. If I did not take it for granted, that you believe all theſe things, I muſt ſuppoſe you to be diſbelievers of the chriſtian revelation in general; which I would by no means do, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome ſtrong and poſitive proof of your infidelity: becauſe as you have had a chriſtian education, and opportunity to know its truth and evidences, your diſbelief of it would infer ſomething ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wrong, either in your heads or hearts, if not in both. Now if you believe the goſpel; if you believe the ſeveral things mentioned above; and are really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch a turn and temper as I have ſuppoſed; certainly you cannot perſiſt in acting ſuch a diſingenuous and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part towards your all-good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous benefactor; towards him who, tho'
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:008667_0259_102fafd4648af330"/>
he might have juſtly frowned you into perdition, when you firſt began to ſin againſt him, has preſerved your lives; has been accumulating his favours and bleſſings upon you, both temporal and ſpiritual; and who ſtill invites you to be reconciled to him thro' Jeſus Chriſt, with the tenderneſs and bowels of a father.— Your delay hitherto, has is perhaps been owing to your inattention, and want of conſidering theſe things: at leaſt I had rather attribute it to this, than to any thing worſe. But now you are put in mind of them, and thus admoniſhed to attend to them, ſurely you will delay no longer; and will be heartily aſhamed and grieved, that you have not, before now, returned unto God thro' Jeſus Chriſt. For can any perſon of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and grateful mind, and who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards his own honor, help being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, "yea, even confounded," when he ſeriouſly reflects that he has often, and long, been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> againſt ſuch a great and good God, who has ſhown ſuch grace and condeſcention to him? Can he reſolutely perſiſt in his evil cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? or be ſo unreaſonable, as to deſire, that his Maker ſhould ſtill wait upon, and intreat him ſeveral years longer? Can you conceive of any thing ſo unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:008667_0260_102fafd7754f3780"/>
a reaſonable creature, as ſuch a conduct towards his Creator? any thing ſo baſe and ſordid? any thing which could juſtly bring ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and infamy upon him?</p>
            <p>WHAT pains will not perſons of a grateful and ingenuous turn of mind take, to pleaſe and gratify thoſe, who have ſhown them great favour and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? who appear'd their friends in a time of affliction and trouble? who, when they were fallen into adverſity, lent them aſſiſtance, and exerted themſelves in their ſervice? People of an ingenuous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, never think they can do too much by way of return to thoſe, who have laid them under peculiar obligations; or be too ready and forward to oblige them. And I doubt not but that you have, ſometimes, taken much pains, to gratify thoſe, who had done kind offices for you, tho' not very conſiderable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and even been ſorry that you could not do more for them. How ſtrange is it then, if you are not ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to make a proper return to your Father in heaven, for his manifold mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; ſaying, "What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?" Should you not be infinitely more deſirous to pleaſe him, by doing his will, than you are to
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:008667_0261_102fafdc445c93c0"/>
requite the kindneſſes of your fellow-mortals, whoſe favors are, comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, ſo ſmall and inconſiderable?</p>
            <p>YOU, perhaps, frequently hear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons blamed for their ungratitude, and cenſured for uſing their benefactors ill: Yea, perhaps you often blame others for their unworthy treatment of yourſelves; for not making ſuitable returns to your kindneſs, and the obligations which you have laid them under. All this may be very juſt; for I am not inſenſible that this is indeed a very evil and ungrateful world, that we live in: And not only you, but others in general, look upon perſons of an ingrateful temper, with a mixture of contempt and indignation, as ſome of the baſeſt, vileſt, and moſt brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh of men. Now, tho' I am no romeiſh prieſt, I might venture to abſolve you from all your ſins, paſt, preſent, and to come, even without auricular confeſſion, if you can produce any inſtance or example of ingratitude amongſt men, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards one another, half ſo foul, and infamous, or which diſcovers half ſo much baſeneſs, as there is in delaying to keep God's commandments, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to rebel againſt him; conſidering his infinite goodneſs and kindneſs to us. What you condemn, and condemn juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:008667_0262_102fafdf89b41d98"/>
as ſordid ingratitude in your fellow-mortals towards yourſelves, or towards others, is generoſity, greatneſs of ſoul, and true honor, in compariſon of your own conduct towards almighty God, your Father who is in heaven, while you go in your treſpaſſes againſt him; while you deſpiſe the riches of his goodneſs, forbearance and long-ſuffering; while you diſregard his gracious calls and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties in the goſpel, and tread under foot his Son, who died for your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What good offices have you done to others? What obligations have you laid them under? What favor or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has any man ſhown to another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually great with the favor and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which God has manifeſted towards us all in common, and the obligations he has laid us under, to keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? What is there that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo foul a name as that of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in our moſt unworthy treatment of each other, in compariſon of that which we are juſtly chargeable with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, if we perſevere long in abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his goodneſs, and affronting his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by our unrighteous deeds? Surely, then, it becomes you to make haſte, and not delay to keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; or elſe to renounce all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:008667_0263_102fafe10ea24eb0"/>

            <p>TO conclude, therefore, let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, as you would avoid ſo juſtly deſerved, and ſo great infamy, without delay to turn your feet unto God's teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to be reconciled unto him, and live.—No—Upon recollecting myſelf, I will not do this; but leave the matter to your own reflection, and conſcience: For if any are ſo baſe and ungrateful as to diſregard the intreaties of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he condeſcends, as it were, to beſeech them to be reconciled to him; certainly I have no reaſon to expect, that they will regard mine, who am their fellow-mortal, and their "ſervant for Jeſus' ſake"—I ſhall therefore cloſe this diſcourſe, only with aſking thoſe, who are ſtill going on in their ſins, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God's goodneſs and grace, his kind perſwaſions and intreaties, How long they propoſe their Maker ſhall thus wait to be gracious?

together with the hazard there is, that ſuch audacious contemners of his diſpleaſure, will be utterly forſaken of him, and left to fill up the dreadful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their iniquities; being quite har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened thro' the deceitfulneſs of ſin, long continued in againſt light; and having their "conſciences ſeared as with a hot iron". Some hints to this purpoſe have, I believe, been occaſionally dropped, in ſome of the preceeding diſcourſes on the preſent ſubject: But the argument ſeems to deſerve a more diſtinct conſideration, and to be treated with greater extent, being very important in it's nature.</p>
            <p>SOME of the laſt arguments were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated, and deſigned, to operate upon the minds of perſons who are naturally of an ingenuous temper, and who are not yet gone far in the paths of ſin, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than upon perſons of a crabbed, ſour, and ſordid diſpoſition, or ſuch as have greatly corrupted themſelves, by a long habit of ſinning. And it is hoped that ſuch arguments may, by the bleſſing of God, have their intended effect on that ſort of perſons, for whom they were deſigned. The preſent argument is of a ſomewhat different kind; as it is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, and principally, intended for perſons of a different character; namely,
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:008667_0268_102faff1288980a0"/>
for thoſe, if there are any ſuch here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before God, who are little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing affected with a ſenſe of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's goodneſs, forbearance and long-ſuffering; being deſtitute of all ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and generoſity of temper; or who are already vicious and corrupt to a great degree. There is ſcarce any other way of coming at perſons of this latter cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but by alarming their fears, and ſhewing them the great danger they are in, of being ſoon rejected of God, and finally incurring an aggravated condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>IT is neceſſary that preſumptuous tranſgreſſors, who have no ſenſe of ſhame or honor, and no fear of God before their eyes, ſhould be admoniſhed to conſider, how terrible the majeſty of that God is, whom they dare thus to affront and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke; what danger there is, that they will be given over by him to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate mind; and at length be caſt into hell-fire; where ſuch inſolent defiers of their maker's diſpleaſure will, except they repent, be puniſhed with a ſeverity proportionable to their daring impieties. However, I would not be miſunderſtood here: Tho' I deſign to ſpeak with all poſſible freedom and plainneſs upon this head, I am far from intending to debaſe
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:008667_0269_102faff7ae92b2f0"/>
preaching by ſcolding, or "bringing a railing accuſation," even againſt wicked and ungodly men. Nor will I forget the apoſtle's admonition to Timothy, "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke not an elder [or aged perſon] but intreat him as a father": As, I hope, I have not forgotten what he immediately ſubjoins — "and the younger men as brethren". We had ſcolding and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preaching enough in the town and country, but a few years ſince, to ſuffice for a long time; when it ſeemed to be faſhionable to violate all the rules of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum and modeſty in the pulpit; and he was commonly thought to have the moſt zeal for God, who had leaſt regard to decency in addreſſing himſelf to men.</p>
            <p>NOW, for the illuſtration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent argument, it will be proper briefly to remind you, both of the greatneſs and majeſty of God, and of the littleneſs and weakneſs of man, From whence will beſt appear the bold impiety, and audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, of men's perſevering in the breach of his known commandments, while he admoniſhes them to repent, and amend their ways. Something will then be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded concerning the danger of God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provoked wholly to withdraw his Holy Spirit from ſuch, and to give them up intirely to their own hearts luſts; as
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:008667_0270_102faff937558ed0"/>
alſo, concerning the aggravated perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe, who have ſpent a long life in ſinning againſt God, without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at laſt, to give him glory. Which things being conſidered, it will appear, how highly it concerns all ſinners, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the aged, who have delayed long already, immediately to turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies, leſt ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhould be their ruin.</p>
            <p>TO return then: Let me briefly remind you of the greatneſs and majeſty of God; which appear, both by his mighty works which men behold, and from his ſacred oracles. How wiſe, powerful and great, muſt that Being be, who created the heavens and the earth, with all that they contain? this mighty univerſe, which, to our ſenſes, appears boundleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite? And you know, that he who made, upholds and governs all things, can, if he pleaſes, deſtroy them with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual eaſe. What power can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his, who is omnipotent? What wiſdom may be likened to that of the only wiſe God? What greatneſs is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate with his, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain? What do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and majeſty, and glory, may be reſembled to that of almighty God, whoſe dominion is everlaſting, whoſe
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:008667_0271_102faffac43ec6d8"/>
kingdom ruleth over all, and who has ſet his glory above the heavens? Reflect ſoberly upon the works of God, and the ſublime repreſentations which the holy ſcriptures give us of his perfections, and the "glorious majeſty of his kingdom;" and then, altho' you may poſſibly be at a loſs, which proclaims his power and greatneſs the moſt, yet you will be filled with aſtoniſhment at both; and be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that all nations are, indeed, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before him; yea, "leſs than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and vanity."</p>
            <p>FOR, what a little, inconſiderable creature man is, in compariſon of his Maker, I was, in the next place, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you.
<q>When I conſider the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, ſays the Pſalmiſt, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the ſtars which thou haſt ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him?</q>
This is a very natural reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For nothing can give us ſo juſt a ſenſe of our own littleneſs, and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficance, as conſidering the power and greatneſs of God.—"What is man!"— A reptile of a day; a child of duſt, bro't forth in ſorrow and tears; altogether helpleſs in his infancy; cruſhed before the moth, even in youth; in old age,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:008667_0272_102faffc4b32a360"/>
burthened by the graſs-hopper; and in his beſt eſtate, altogether vanity! He pretends to be wiſe, but is ever loſt in error; his knowledge is but ignorance; his ſtrength weakneſs; his health and diſeaſe almoſt the ſame; his pains tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting; his very pleaſures vexatious; his birth and death but an hand-breadth aſunder; to-day, boaſting himſelf of to-morrow; and to-morrow the food of vermin, the worm feeding ſweetly on him!—Such is man; wholly mean and vile; excepting that he is animated by the breath of God; and that his Maker has been ſo mindful of him, as to give his own Son to redeem him. Which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſideration, while it ſeems to give us ſome degree of ſignificance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the creation, may, at the ſame time, ſerve for our humiliation: ſince it was the ſinfulneſs and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our condition, that were the ground or occaſion of God's manifeſting ſuch a regard to us. And, indeed, we are not to eſtimate ourſelves, or our real worth, by what God has, in his grace and condeſcention done for us (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which rule of judging, we ſhould be creatures of great dignity and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;) but by what we are in ourſelves naturally, and independently thereof;
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:008667_0273_102fb000f65a2770"/>
according to which, we muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ourſelves little, vile and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible creatures, how prone ſoever we may be to think highly of ourſelves. For ſuch we are in God's account, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he hath ſo graciouſly viſited us; at leaſt we are ſo in compariſon of him.
<q>Behold even to the moon, and it ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, yea, the ſtars are not clean in his ſight: how much leſs man that is a worm; and the ſon of man which is a worm.</q>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Job 35.5, 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE more we know of God and of ourſelves, the greater diſtance ſhall we perceive between him and us; and the more readily ſhall we acquieſce in the juſtice of thoſe ſentiments, which aſcribe to him, all glory, majeſty, might, and dominion; and to ourſelves, weakneſs, vileneſs and unworthineſs.</p>
            <p>NOW, having thus briefly reminded you of the greatneſs and glory of God, and the littleneſs and vileneſs of man; you may from hence, in ſome meaſure, conceive what preſumption, what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is, for ſinners to perſevere in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting him, by a continued violation of his commandments, notwithſtanding his repeated threatnings. The boldneſs and preſumption of any one's conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a ſuperior, is to be eſtimated by
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:008667_0274_102fb005e95081f0"/>
the diſtance which there is between them; by the relative greatneſs and power, or littleneſs and weakneſs, of the one to the other. According to which rule judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho' we may in ſome meaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, yet it will be impoſſible to expreſs, the amazing preſumption of man's wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully continuing to offend his Creator; the diſtance between them being infinite. For ſuch an inferior and weak creature as man, to riſe up in rebellion againſt the almighty Lord of the univerſe; and not only once to rebel, but to repeat his acts of rebellion from year to year; to trample upon the authority of Him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe ſuſtaining hand, he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly drop into nothing, from whence he is ſo little removed; to deſpiſe his awful threatnings; and, in the language of ſcripture, to run even upon "the thick boſſes of his buckler," as tho' he "had an arm like God, or could thunder with a voice like him;" for weak, mortal man thus to contemn, thus to provoke Him, before whom Cherubim and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim bow with veiled faces; and from whoſe frown apoſtate angels would, were it poſſible, hide themſelves even in the loweſt depths of hell;—ſurely, it is not poſſible, I ſay, for words fully to ſet forth the impious madneſs of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="unknown:008667_0275_102fb007b46c8070"/>TO what ſhall we reſemble this beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of ſinners? What compariſon can we think of, which will not rather tend to leſſen the preſumption thereof, than to place it in a juſt and proper light? Shall we ſay, this is as if a ſervant, who had diſobey'd his maſters command, and who, being threatned that he ſhould be beaten with many ſtripes, unleſs he returned to his duty, ſhould intirely diſregard theſe threatnings, and even grow more idle and inſolent? No: this compariſon would not anſwer; but tend to diminiſh, rather than to illuſtrate, the guilt and horror of ſuch preſumptuous ſinners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Becauſe the ſuppoſed maſter in the compariſon, as weil as the ſervant, is but a frail, mortal man; whereas the ſinner perſeveres in his diſobedience to the commands of him, who "only hath immortality," and to whom all power belongeth. Shall we ſay, then, that this is as it one of the loweſt menial ſervants of the greateſt potentate of the earth, ſhould not only contemn his ſovereign's orders, but make it his practice from time to time to ſpit in his face, whenever he approached him? No: neither will this ſimilitude anſwer, for the ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reaſon. There is realy more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the conduct of preſumptuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:008667_0276_102fb00939f449d8"/>
towards God, than there would be in any, the meaneſt domeſtic of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty king, treating him in that manner.— Shall we then ſay, that this is as if a worm of the duſt, ſuppoſing it endow'd with a degree of intelligence, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Gabriel, or ſome other arch-angel, and array himſelf to the battle againſt him? Neither will ſimilitude ſerve the purpoſe; becauſe there is ſtill an infinitely greater diſtance between God and man, than there is between the higheſt arch-angel, and the leaſt reptile of the earth. All that is fabled of the giants of old, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war againſt heaven, is more than realized in the mad preſumption of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men: for thoſe were ſuppoſed to be creatures of far greater power than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men, while the gods of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, againſt whom they were ſuppoſed to wage war, were not to be compared to our God, tho' "among the ſons of the mighty." It muſt therefore, after all, be left to your own imagination to paint out the audaciouſneſs, and horrid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of thoſe men, who go on from year to year, perhaps till old age, in affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almighty God, by contemning his. authority, and breaking his known com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, notwithſtanding his repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed threatnings. For as was intimated
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:008667_0277_102fb00ac6872868"/>
before, I can think of no compariſons, but what will rather leſſen the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than ſet it in a full and proper light.</p>
            <p>NOW when we conſider the great preſumption, and daring impiety, of men's continuing from time to time, to trample upon God's commandments; does there not ſeem to be danger, that he may be provoked to withdraw his holy Spirit intirely from ſuch, and to leave them wholly to themſelves; the certain conſequence of which, will be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their ſouls? It is here taken for granted, that God's Spirit ſtrives with ſinners in general, in conjunction with his word and providence, and their own reaſon, in order to reclaim them from their wicked ways. But are we ſure that he will continue always thus to ſtrive with them by his Spirit, while they live in this world? Are we ſure that he will not forſake, and give them over, before they are taken hence to be here no more? Has he promiſed, that he will not do ſo? Certainly he has not; ſo that they can have no aſſurance, that he will not: And this is what preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſinners have great reaſon to fear may be the ſad conſequence of their da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring impiety. I ſay, the ſad conſequence of it; becauſe ſhould this be the caſe,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:008667_0278_102fb01374452250"/>
they will never after repent and reform; but their perdition will be in ſome ſenſe inevitable, altho' they ſhould live many years after being thus forſaken of God.</p>
            <p>THERE are, if I miſtake not, ſome plain intimations in ſcripture, that God does actually, ſometimes, thus forſake the preſumptuous tranſgreſſors of his laws; and warnings and admonitions given us to this purpoſe, leſt we ſhould too far abuſe his goodneſs and patience. What do you think of thoſe words?—
<q>My people would not hearken to my voice; and Iſrael would none of me: So I gave them up to their own hearts luſt; and they walked in their own counſels <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 81.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, 12.</note>.</q>
What do you think of this other paſſage?—
<q>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things which are not convenient; being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all unrighteouſneſs, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 1.28, 29.</note>
               </q>
— &amp;c. What is plainly ſuppoſed, or implied in thoſe words of David, after he had greatly provoked God?—
<q>Caſt me not way from thy preſence; and take not thy Holy Spirit from me <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 51.11.</note>.</q>
Has not God ſaid, That his
<q>Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man</q>?
Is it not ſaid of ſome, that
<q>becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:008667_0279_102fb01520293ef0"/>
not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved; for this cauſe God ſhall [even] ſend them ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion that they ſhould believe a lie, that they all might be damned</q>?
Yea, is not God ſpoken of in ſcripture as hardening the hearts of ſinners, already obdurate? Which, at leaſt, muſt imply that he does nothing to ſoften them; but ſuffers them, by their preſumptuous perſeverance, to wax worſe and worſe; leaving them to their evil heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in departing from him, and to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequences thereof. Do not theſe, and other paſſages of ſcripture ſimilar to them, plainly ſuppoſe, that God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo provoked by the repeated and preſumptuous ſins of men, againſt the light of their own conſciences, the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of his word and providences, and the ſtrivings of his Spirit, as wholly to withdraw his Spirit from them, leaving them to work iniquity with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to walk in the way of their heart, and in the ſight of their eyes, and ſo to fill up the meaſure of their ſins? And in conformity hereto, when we are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed not to "grieve," and not to "quench the Spirit," muſt we not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome ſort of threatning implied, to this purpoſe, that God will take his
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:008667_0280_102fb016a51d6378"/>
Holy Spirit from us, if ye perſiſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking him to do ſo, by our wilful ſins? This will not admit of any reaſonable doubt. And theſe in general, I ſuppoſe, are the ſentiments deſigned to be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Wiſdom of Solomon—
<q>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts ſeparate from God — For into a malicious ſoul wiſdom will not enter; nor dwell in the body that is ſubject unto ſin. For the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of diſcipline flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and will not abide when unrighteouſneſs cometh in <note n="e" place="margin">Chap. 1.3, 4, 5.</note>
               </q>.</p>
            <p>Now, if this be the caſe; if God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wholly and finally withdraws his Spirit from preſumptuous ſinners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they will neither have the power, nor any inclination, to repent, and return to him; what is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence hereof? It is both plain and awful; <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe perſons, from whom God thus takes his Spirit, after having borne and ſtriven long with them, are in ſome ſenſe paſt their probationary ſtate, or day of grace, as ſoon as ever they are thus given over to their own hearts luſt, how long ſoever they live in this world afterwards. Upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſuppoſitions, if true, as they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs are, being grounded on ſcripture,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:008667_0281_102fb01a0ac76a28"/>
the final ſtate of ſuch perſons is already fixed, as much as the ſtate of thoſe, who are already taken out of this world in their ſins: Tho' we uſually ſpeak in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of ſinners being in a ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, during the whole term of their life here on earth. Which can be juſt and proper only in this ſenſe, that a truly penitent and reformed ſinner ſhall obtain mercy thro' Jeſus Chriſt, whenever he becomes ſo, tho' it be on a death-bed, and in his laſt moments. In this ſenſe our ſtate of trial, or ſeaſon of grace, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs commenſurate with the preſent life. But nevertheleſs it may in reality be over, before our lives are run out; and is in effect ſo, whenever our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſion to God, are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd morally and naturally impoſſible, by the total and final withdrawing of his Spirit from us. And how long ſoever perſons may live after being thus given over of God, they are left only to fill up their ſins, and ſit themſelves thereby for a more aggravated condemnation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: As good men, who are already paſſed from death unto life, are left here that they may perfect holineſs in the fear of God, and thereby become entitled to a greater reward in heaven. The former are not, properly ſpeaking, in a
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:008667_0282_102fb020b2dad838"/>
ſtate of probation for happineſs and miſery in another world; becauſe, by the very ſuppoſition, they have already ſinned away their ſeaſon of grace; God having wholly and finally withdrawn his Spirit from them, ſo that it is now both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and naturally impoſſible, that they ſhould ever truly repent, or turn their feet unto his teſtimonies. Tho' it will by no means follow from hence, that they are not, even in this ſtate of dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction, accountable for their conduct; or that they may not be juſtly puniſhed for the ſins which they commit, after being thus given over to their own hearts luſt. They are ſtill in a capacity to incur guilt, tho' not in a capacity of obtaining eternal life, or the ſalvation of the goſpel. Altho' by the ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons gone upon, they have already "ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto death," they may ſtill go on ſinning; and "treaſuring up unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath:" And if we certainly knew of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons in this ſtate, "I ſay not that we ſhould pray for them <note n="f" place="margin">John 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>16.</note>," any more than for the wicked actually dead, and gone to "their own place."</p>
            <p>Now, not to uſe many exclamations on the point, theſe are moſt awful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and highly deſerve the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:008667_0283_102fb02263ff31d8"/>
awakened attention of all thoſe, who ſin preſumptuouſly againſt God; eſpecially of ſuch as have already long abuſed his mercy and patience, grieving that good Spirit, by which others are "ſealed to the day of redemption." For tho' their death may poſſibly be at a great diſtance; yet how nigh may that time be, when God, whom they have forſaken, ſhall wholly forſake them; when he ſhall caſt them off forever, "ſwearing in his wrath, that they ſhall never enter into his reſt;" as he once ſware concerning ſome of the rebellious Iſraelites in the wilderneſs!</p>
            <p>BUT, as was obſerved above, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſerious conſideration of all preſumptuous ſinners without exception: For tho' ſuch as have long gone on in their evil ways, ſeem to be more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerned in it; yet it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that God has fixed, and made known to us, no certain ſpace, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of time, wherein his Spirit ſhall ſtrive with ſinners reſpectively, any more than he has made known to us, how long we are reſpectively to live. We are as ignorant of the former, as we are of the latter; and there may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be as great a variety in his dealings with ſinners, with reference to one of
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:008667_0284_102fb024439459f0"/>
theſe things, as there certainly is with reference to the other; I mean the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective duration of their lives. There are ſome perſons who, even in youth, make a ſad, a ſurpriſing progreſs in vice and impiety; and who are apparently hardened to a great degree, thro' the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin. And ſome, even of theſe, may poſſibly be near the time wherein God ſhall finally give them over, except they repent. Yea, for any thing we can tell to the contrary, there may be ſome among theſe, as well as among more aged and veteran ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom God has already actually thus given up to their own hearts luſts; with whom his Spirit ſhall no more ſtrive.—God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, there ſhould be any ſuch abandoned, ſuch loſt and undone, ſuch irreparably loſt and undone ſinners, amongſt us, whether young or old! But whether there are or not, God only knows. — All have at leaſt ſome reaſon to fear that this may be their own wretched caſe, who have long been ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God with an high hand, and yet have now no conſiderable remorſe of conſcience; no concern about their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; no deſire to reform their ways. This eaſe and ſecurity in ſin, is a proof that God's Spirit is, in a great meaſure,

actually withdrawn from them already; and gives, at leaſt, ſome ground to fear, that it may 'ere long totally and finally forſake them: And then, "good were it for ſuch, if they had never been born!"</p>
            <p>LET none therefore, whether old or young, preſume to harden their hearts againſt God another day, another hour, or moment; leſt the divine patience ſhould have a period put to it, before a period is put to their audacious offences againſt the high and holy God. Wo be to that man, whoever, or wherever he be, who is thus finally forſaken of God. Tho' he may perhaps live long, and be quiet from any fear of evil; enjoying both outward proſperity, and carnal peace within, his heart being waxed groſs, and his conſcience ſeared, he is only as an ox in the ſtall, unconſciouſly and ſtupidly nouriſhing himſelf for the day of ſlaughter!</p>
            <p>THIS brings me, in the next place, to remind you of the aggravated condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which awaits thoſe, who have ſpent a long life in diſobedience to God's commandments; I mean thoſe, who have provoked God by their repeated and preſumptuous ſins, to withdraw his Holy Spirit from them, and who die at laſt, laden both with iniquity and years.

It doubtleſs becomes us to reſpect the hoary head, eſpecially when found in the way of righteouſneſs. But the Ancient of days pays no reverence to age as ſuch, any more than to youth; and you know what he has ſaid concerning the "ſinner of an hundred years old," ſo that it need not be here repeated. It is in general very evident, that they who live long without thinking on their ways, ſo as to turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies, and who at laſt die in their ſins, muſt needs have a much greater weight of guilt lying upon them, than they who die in youth, altho' the lives of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have alſo been "among the unclean." And by how much more guilt any have incurred during this probationary ſtate, by ſo much ſorer a puniſhment, we may be ſure, they will be thought worthy in the day of retribution, when every man ſhall be judged according to his works. And thus, altho' a man may now think himſelf, both the more happy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for living long; yet the time may at length come, when he ſhall have reaſon to wiſh that he died, like many others, in youth; yea, when he ſhall have much more cauſe than ever Job had, to ſay,
<q>Let the day periſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was born; and the night in which
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:008667_0287_102fb02f83d10148"/>
it was ſaid, There is a man-child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived — Let that day be darkneſs — let darkneſs, and the ſhadow of death ſtain it!</q>
— This may poſſibly be the ſad caſe of any particular perſon, who now goes on preſumptuouſly in his tranſgreſſions. And there is great reaſon to fear, it will actually be the caſe of thoſe, who have already lived to old age, and have not yet remembred their Creator, whom they ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred even in the days of their youth, before theſe evil days came, wherein the moſt may truly ſay, that they "have no pleaſure in them"; eſpecially thoſe who, in the decline of life, are deſtitute of the hopes and comforts of religion. It is probable there are but few perſons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſpeaking, who live in the known violation of God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments till old age, then turn their feet unto his teſtimonies. So that tho' the ſtate of ſuch is not abſolutely deſperate, yet it is extremely hazardous and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
            <p>BUT I now proceed, in the laſt place, more particularly to draw and enforce the practical inference from what has been ſaid in this diſcourſe. It is this: Theſe things being conſidered, it highly concerns all, eſpecially the aged, who
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:008667_0288_102fb0310c604620"/>
have delayed ſo long already, now to think on their ways, and make haſte to keep God's commandments. Reaſon allows of no delays in religion. Reaſon ſhows all, of every age, the importance of devoting themſelves immediately to the ſervice of God. If God is always the ſame almighty, all-wiſe, holy, juſt and good Being; and if we are always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon him, certainly he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be reverenced and obeyed by all his creatures. There is no time, or moment of life, whether early or late, wherein we can excuſe ourſelves in the neglect of him, or in breaking any one of his commandments, tho' it were the leaſt; to do which preſumptuouſly, were practically to renounce his authority, or to deny that he is God. And when, in conformity to what has been ſaid above, you ſeriouſly conſider his greatneſs and majeſty; and your own weakneſs and littleneſs in compariſon of him; when you conſider the audaciouſneſs, or rather the madneſs, of perſevering in trampling on his laws, while he admoniſhes, and threatens, and, as it were, ſhews you his hand full of thunder and vengeance; when you duly conſider the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there is, that he will be provoked by your continuing to grieve and affront his
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:008667_0289_102fb032957eda78"/>
good Spirit, intirely to take it from you, with the dreadful conſequences hereof; when you conſider the aggravated guilt which you will incur, by ſpending a long life, if ſuch an one ſhould be allowed you, in ſinning againſt God; together with the real danger there is, according to what has been found true in all ages, that being grown old in impiety and vice, you will not then effectually reform your evil ways, tho' there is a poſſibility of it; but only fill up the meaſure of your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and ſo be finally wretched in proportion to the duration of the ſpace allowed you for repentance: When you ſeriouſly conſider theſe things, I ſay, it is impoſſible but that you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the juſtneſs of the concluſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned; viz. that you ſhould loſe no more time; that you ſhould make no longer delay; that you ſhould not harden your hearts againſt God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moment; but make haſte to keep his holy commandments. Will any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, or even to think, that there is no occaſion for making ſpeed, when God warns, threatens, and admoniſhes us to fly for refuge? Can any think themſelves prudent, or ſafe, in once more grieving that "holy Spirit of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline," which may then be utterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:008667_0290_102fb03ac8225df0"/>
from them; whereby their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, already ſo dangerous, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſolutely deſperate? Is it reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to procraſtinate, becauſe, if you are not old already, you may poſſibly live to become ſo? eſpecially conſidering that tho' you ſhould, it is moſt probable you will, by age, become more hardened in ſin, and ſo incur at laſt a more aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted guilt and condemnation?</p>
            <p>THESE things being duly conſidered, what can be ſaid in excuſe, even for the young, if they delay their repentance, and their return to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt? I know of nothing, unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it be, that they are beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and "know not what they do." They who are already arrived at middle age, are ſtill leſs excuſable than youth, upon any principles of reaſon; or, unleſs they would avail themſelves of the apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy juſt now mentioned, viz. that they are mad, which is the beſt, or rather the only tolerable one that I can think of. But what is the moſt aſtoniſhing of all, is, that there ſhould be many aged perſons in the chriſtian world, people already bowed down with years and infirmities, and on the very conſines of another world, who ſeem to think, that even They have no need to make haſte, but may ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:008667_0291_102fb03c9f19c2f0"/>
to keep God's commandments; as tho' they had not, by ſo many years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in ſin, ſufficiently exerciſed the divine patience, or made it manifeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, how much they contemn God, and how little they value the ſalvation of their ſouls!</p>
            <p>I WOULD willingly hope, that there are no ſuch perſons as theſe laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, now preſent in this aſſembly. But there is One, who certainly knoweth! —And I imagine I may, without any uncharitableneſs, or the leaſt indecorum, intreat the aged, with all due reſpect to their years, ſeriouſly to examine their own hearts, and their paſt lives. Aſk yourſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I beſeech you, whether you have indeed turned your feet unto God's teſtimonies? whether you now live in a conſcientious obedience to all his known commandments? whether you walk as the diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt ought to walk, having your converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from whence we look for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? In fine, can you reflect, with inward ſatisfaction, upon the manner in which you have ſpent ſo many years; or at leaſt ſome of the laſt of them? and can you look forward into that world, to which you are ſo near, with comfort, with holy hope, and a joyful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:008667_0292_102fb03e27d0e6d0"/>
of a crown of righteouſneſs, to be given you by the righteous Judge and Lord at his appearing? Theſe are ſuch queſtions, my honoured fathers, as you will doubtleſs think proper to put to yourſelves; and happy is he that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them to his own ſatisfaction, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the holy ſcriptures for his guide and rule in theſe inquiries. But if there ſhould happen to be any aged perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whoſe conſciences give an anſwer, contrary to that which all would chooſe, (a ſuppoſition which I make with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) there is ſcarce any need of my reminding them again, that this, with them, is certainly no ſeaſon of life to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; that they muſt now, of neceſſity, either make haſte to keep God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, or never do it at all; the ſad conſequence whereof has, I ſuppoſe, been ſufficiently repreſented!—</p>
            <p>I HAVE now done with the particular argument propoſed to be handled in this diſcourſe; and, with it, cloſe all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, by which I intended to ſhew the reaſonableneſs and importance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king haſte to keep the commandments of God: Which was the ſecond general head of diſcourſe propounded, when we enter'd on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="288" facs="unknown:008667_0293_102fb0430efee5d0"/>THE conſiderations which have been offered to the mentioned end, are, it is humbly conceived, very weighty in themſelves, how imperfectly ſoever they may have been urged. And being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in their kind, as well as numerous, it is hoped that ſome or other of them will, by the bleſſing of God, have a good effect upon all who have heard them, how different ſoever people may be in their natural tempers and diſpoſitions. However, when the ſalvation of our ſouls is the thing in queſtion, it is not for men to conſult their own particular <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> or <hi>taſte</hi>; or to delay to keep God's commandments, becauſe the arguments uſed to inforce a preſent and immediate obſervance of them, do not happen to <hi>pleaſe their fancy</hi>! Whatever their <hi>taſte</hi> may be, and whatever becomes of the particular arguments, by which the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of righteouſneſs would urge ſpeed in the great concerns of religion; yea, altho' theſe ſhould have really no weight or concluſiveneſs in them, ſtill it is to be remember'd, that to make haſte, or to repent and reform immediately, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and indiſpenſible duty. No man, who really believes there is a God, and a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, can make any doubt of this.</p>

               <pb n="289" facs="unknown:008667_0294_102fb044c338c888"/>HOWEVER, as was intimated above, I hope the arguments inſiſted largely upon, in ſo many diſcourſes, may ſerve, in ſome meaſure, to ſet this matter in a juſt and proper light; becauſe they all appear to me to be ſcriptural, or plainly founded in the oracles of God. And if He, who alone "giveth the increaſe", follows them with his bleſſing, they ſhall not prove as ſeed ſown either by the way ſide, or on ſtony places; but as good ſeed ſown on good ground, which will produce the bleſſed fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

            </p>
            <p>CONSIDERED as a natural means of awakening and convincing ſinful men, ſome good effect may be hoped from theſe ſcriptural arguments. If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of human life; or conſider the greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of reforming hereafter; if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſuperior and exalted pleaſures of a religious life; if you reflect, that the earlier you turn your feet unto God's teſtimonies, the greater your glory and happineſs will be hereafter; if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the peculiar amiableneſs of virtue in youth, or the infamy of vice in age; if you conſider how much more honor is done to God and our Redeemer, by
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:008667_0295_102fb04a1e406280"/>
an early, than by a late repentance; if you conſider the baſeneſs and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of perſevering in ſin, while God mercifully allows us a ſpace for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and intreats us to be reconciled to him thro' his own dear Son; if you conſider the audaciouſneſs, the mad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, of men's going on to affront and provoke the high and holy God from time to time; and the danger there is, that he will wholly take his bleſſed Spirit from us, if we do ſo; together with the aggravated guilt and condemnation of thoſe, who ſpend a long life in diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, and die at laſt in their ſins, which is generally the ſad caſe of thoſe who do not repent and amend their ways before they are far advanced in years: If you ſeriouſly conſider theſe things, I ſay, ſurely you will judge it to be of the laſt importance to make haſte, and the moſt unreaſonable thing in the world to delay to keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. I can think of no better or ſtronger arguments than theſe; none more likely to anſwer the great end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by them. For which reaſon, I thank God that he has given me an opportunity to lay theſe before you ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I have, with all plainneſs and ſincerity, been preaching the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of reconciliation, and eternal life, to you, by Jeſus Chriſt, who was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to take away the ſins of the world; to which end however,
<q>repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</q>
are indiſpenſably neceſſary on our part; ſo that without them, we cannot finally be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of this great ſalvation. And if any of you ſhould die in your ſins, and be miſerable hereafter, which God forbid! I humbly hope in Him, that
<q>your blood will not be required at my hand.</q>
It would be a great, an unſpeakable happineſs to me, to have been in any degree inſtrumental of converting ſinners from the error of their way to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the juſt, that their ſouls might be ſaved from death, and the multitude of their ſins hidden, in the day of the Lord Jeſus.

               </gap>ſt of the three general divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſubject, ſpoken of when we enter'd upon it.</p>
            <p>I HAVE, in ſeven other diſcourſes, ſhown at large, and by a conſiderable variety of arguments, the vaſt importance of <hi>making haſte</hi> to keep God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the extreme folly and danger of delaying. This is what was propoſed under the ſecond general head of diſcourſe. But inſtead of repeating any of theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments here, I ſhall now proceed to the third general diviſion of the ſubject, formerly mentioned: which was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIRDLY,</hi> to ſhow the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>thinking on our ways,</hi> together with the neceſſity, and the conduciveneſs hereof, to a reformation of them. "I thought on my ways," ſays the pſalmiſt, "and turned my feet unto thy teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: I made haſte," &amp;c. plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that ſober reflection on our conduct, or behaviour, is the firſt, and a neceſſary ſtep, in order to a thorough reformation thereof; and living a life of obedience to God's commandments. Conſidering of our ways undoubtedly becomes us as we are reaſonable creatures, under the moral government of God, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:008667_0300_102f7517651243d0"/>
for happineſs in a future ſtate: Principles which are here taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as at leaſt generally, if not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally believed amongſt us. And ſuch conſideration, or reflexion, is not only reaſonable in itſelf, but, as was intimated above, ſeems to be abſolutely neceſſary in order to our turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, after we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily gone aſtray from them. For how can we reform what is amiſs in our tempers, or practices, without firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, what it is that is ſo, or wherein our ways need reforming? And as this is a neceſſary ſtep in order to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo it is alſo naturally and plainly conducive thereto. There is juſt ground to hope, that when people are brought to a ſerious conſideration of their ways, they will, by God's grace and aſſiſtance, actually reform them; or, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the text, turn their feet unto his teſtimonies: yea, there is reaſon to hope, that they will make haſte, and not delay to do it. Delay in this matter ſeems to be chiefly owing to inconſideration. We can hardly ſuppoſe it poſſible for a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, who conſiders his ways, and the conſequences of them as he ought to do, to continue any longer in his vicious courſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="296" facs="unknown:008667_0301_102f751d43693ec8"/>FROM what has now been ſuggeſted, you may perceive that this third gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral head of diſcourſe, compriſes in it the following particulars, under which it will accordingly be conſidered: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE reaſonableneſs of thinking on our ways, as we are rational and moral creatures:</p>
            <p>THE indiſpenſable neceſſity hereof, in order to a thorough reformation of them:</p>
            <p>AND laſtly,</p>
            <p>THE natural conduciveneſs hereof to ſuch amendment; or the ground there is to hope, that thoſe who duly reflect on their ways, will, in conſequence hereof, make haſte to keep God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
            <p>IT is propoſed, by the will of God, to handle theſe three particulars in the ſame number of diſcourſes, as diſtinctly as may well be. I ſay, as diſtinctly as may well be; becauſe they will in the diſcuſſion, almoſt unavoidably run into each other in ſome reſpects. There is a natural and cloſe connexion between them, ſo that it will be hardly poſſible to preſerve them intirely diſtinct thro'out; nor will this be ſtudiouſly endeavoured. However, it is hoped, there will not be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny needleſs repetitions of the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="unknown:008667_0302_102f7558f3152dd0"/>To return then: The buſineſs of this diſcourſe, is to ſhew the reaſonableneſs of thinking on our ways, as we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and moral creatures, in a ſtate of probation. For I will not ſuſpect any of my auditors to be ſo degenerate, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated to ſuch a degree, as to doubt whether man has, or has not, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, any "preheminence above a beaſt," tho' it ſeems ſome of our pretended ſages, both ancient and modern, have made this a queſtion, or rather confidently aſſumed and defended the negative; and even gloried in degrading themſelves into the rank of brutes. It is doubtleſs a ſottiſh impiety to
<q>change the glory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man</q>;
and much more ſo, to
<q>birds, and fourfooted beaſts, and creeping things.</q>
It is a degree of the ſame impious folly, for men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade themſelves, even in ſpeculation, into brutes;
<q>for in the image of God made he man</q>: And it is at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that none ever did this in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, till they had firſt done it in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and for that reaſon.</p>
            <p>YOU are ſenſible that the author of our being has made us rational, moral creatures; not "like the horſe and mule which have no underſtanding";
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:008667_0303_102fb0f76cf9a048"/>
and therefore, that we ought not to make ourſelves like them, by baniſhing thought and reflexion, and ſinking into a ſtate of brutal inſenſibility. Tho' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, or reflexion, is not the chief, ultimate buſineſs of man; yet it ought plainly to be one principal part of his employment; and it is the firſt in order, as it is by this that we are to regulate all our conduct in other reſpects. Surely the faculty of reaſon, comprehending memory, reflexion and fore-caſt, or the ability of diſcerning before-hand certain effects in their cauſes, was given us for ſome end by our creator. It was not given us to lie dormant, and unemploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but to be conſtantly exerciſed in ſome way or other.</p>
            <p>NOR indeed is it poſſible for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind to remain quite idle and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for any conſiderable time together. It is in its nature active and ſtirring: It will unavoidably be employed, almoſt inceſſantly, in thinking on one thing or another. For altho' it has, in a great meaſure, the choice of the objects, or the ſubjects, on which it will employ it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wherein its freedom partly conſiſts; yet it ſeems not to be at liberty, whether it will think and reflect at all or not. — While a man is awake, he will always
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:008667_0304_102fb0f8f4786b38"/>
employ his thoughts on ſome ſubject or other; yea, he does this ſometimes even in ſleep; as in dreams. So thoughtful, ſo contemplative a creature is man by nature, if not againſt, yet without his will! All men do not think and reflect upon the ſame matters; and many, alas! do not think ſoberly and properly, either upon themſelves, or any thing elſe,
<q>as they ought to think.</q>
But you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve none, whoſe thoughts are not, ſome way or other, actually employed. Even the <hi>fool,</hi> who in the language of a wit, "whiſtles for want of thought," ſtill thinks upon his whiſtling at leaſt; and upon ſome of the objects around him; tho', to be ſure, not wiſely. The fool thinks, tho' it be only fooliſhly; and the madman, tho' it be only madly. It is probable that all men think and reflect nearly with the ſame conſtancy, tho' up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on different objects, with different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of intenſeneſs; ſome more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, others leſs; ſome wiſely, and others fooliſhly. The grand difference between wiſe men and fools, or madmen, ſeems not to lie in this, that the former think and reflect more conſtantly and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptedly than the latter, but only more juſtly, or to better purpoſe. For "vain thoughts will ſtill lodge within us," if
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:008667_0305_102fb0fa7b3a9ce8"/>
wiſe ones do not: the very nature of man, and his condition in this world, being ſuch, that he cannot ordinarily but employ his thoughts on ſome thing or other. He muſt needs think, conſider, and reflect, tho' it be only upon trifles, on things of no importance to himſelf or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and even upon them in a fooliſh, abſurd manner.</p>
            <p>BEING therefore endow'd with this diſtinguiſhing faculty, certainly we ought to exerciſe and employ it upon things worthy of it, and in the beſt manner poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. We ſhould think chiefly on things that are of importance to us. Tho' we ſpeak of mankind in general as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures; yet ſurely, all men do not exerciſe their rational faculties in a way equally reaſonable, equally becoming ſuch creatures. It is an abuſe and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution of our reaſon, to employ it only, or chiefly, upon trifles; eſpecially while there are ſo many things, worthy to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it, and take up our attention. It is our indiſpenſible duty, as creatures who have received ſo noble a faculty from God, to exerciſe it chiefly upon things of weight and moment; things wherein his honor, and our own good are concerned. If we do not thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it, we had as good, perhaps better,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:008667_0306_102fb0fdad287878"/>
been wholly deſtitute of reaſon. It is rather a diſgrace to us, than any honor, while we employ it in an unworthy manner; and not only ſhame, but guilt and miſery, muſt be the conſequence of ſuch an abuſe.</p>
            <p>IT is evident then, that we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made for thought and conſideration in general; but alſo that we ought to chuſe fit and worthy objects on which to employ our rational faculties; ſince otherwiſe we can hardly deſerve a better title than that of fools, or madmen. And what is there, on which it more concerns us to think, than on <hi>our own ways,</hi> as we are moral and accountable creatures? I ſay, as we are moral and accountable creatures: For to think on our ways in the ſcriptural and theological ſenſe, is not merely to reflect on the actions which we have heretofore done, or to conſider the courſe of life which we lead at preſent. This does not, of itſelf, come up to the full ſenſe of the Pſalmiſt in the text. To think on our ways in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſenſe, is to conſider them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God and his will, to the rule of our duty, and to a future ſtate; or as we are the ſubjects of God's moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are hereafter to be rewarded or puniſhed by him, according to the
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:008667_0307_102fb1031fbf4220"/>
"things done in the body." To think ſeriouſly on our behaviour, and review it in this point of light, in order to know how the caſe ſtands between God and our ſouls; whether we are in the way that leadeth to life, or in the broader path that leadeth to death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this, I ſay, is to think on our ways in the ſenſe of ſcripture. And this being explained, certainly no man who believes the holy ſcriptures; yea, no man who believes the moral character and government of God, and a future ſtate of retribution, can doubt but that he ought thus to think on his ways.</p>
            <p>HAS God made us capable of virtue and religion, and of rendering him a reaſonable ſervice; and ſhall we never conſider, whether our conduct is ſuch as becomes creatures thus diſtinguiſhed? Has he written his law upon our hearts, and our conſciences; and ſhall we never inquire, whether we have conformed ourſelves thereto, or deviated from it in our behaviour? Has he given us a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his will from heaven, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and apoſtles, and his own Son; and ſhall we not conſider, whether we have yielded obedience thereto, or trampled on his authority? Has he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly promiſed eternal life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:008667_0308_102fb104a75f9318"/>
to us on certain conditions; and ſhall we never think it worth while to inquire, whether we have complied with them or not? Has he alſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to puniſh with an everlaſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

               </gap> but obey unrighteouſneſs; and ſhall we not be inquiſitive, whether we are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this curſe or not? Are theſe ſuch trivial matters, as not to claim our thoughts and attention? And are the common buſineſs and amuſements of life, of ſo much importance to us, as to juſtify our giving our minds wholly, or chiefly, to them? No man can heſitate, or be at any loſs, for the true and proper anſwer to theſe ſeveral demands; his conſcience will ſpeak, tho' his lips are ſilent. You cannot but know, that if you neglect to think on your ways, whatever elſe you may employ your thoughts on, you are chargeable with a great and fundamental omiſſion; and act a part wholly unworthy of creatures, who claim the title of rational.</p>
            <p>THE grand concern of mankind is, to act with propriety as the ſubjects of God's moral government. Upon this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future intereſt depends. And whether we act ſuch a part or not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known by us with out thinking
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:008667_0309_102fb1064e240a78"/>
on our ways; and examining them by the rule which God has given us to walk by. Without this we cannot tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we keep the commandments of God, or live in diſobedience to them; whether we are the objects of his favour, or of his wrath; whether we are heirs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, or of death and perdition. And can we content ourſelves in ſuch an ignorance of our ſtate and condition? What inquiry is there that ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us as this, whether we have hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to the voice of the Son of God, ſo as to comply with the terms of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and conſequently, whether we are ſuch perſons as he will approve in the day of judgment? Or whether we are ſuch workers of iniquity, to whom he will ſay,
<q>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels?</q>
If we think at all, we muſt acknowledge it to be both our duty and intereſt, thus to examine ourſelves and our conduct.</p>
            <p>IT is the duty and intereſt of all men in general, both good and bad, thus to think on their ways: And indeed, as was juſt now intimated, no one can tell, which of theſe characters belongs to him, without firſt making the inquiry, by comparing his ways and practices with
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:008667_0310_102fb1098911de70"/>
the rule of his duty, the word of God. So that this examination is not of leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to us, than it is to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are the ſons of God, and heirs of eternal life, or children of wrath, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to eternal deſtruction; to one or other of which claſſes of men, we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, whether we conſider it or not.</p>
            <p>IF we are good men, there will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be at leaſt two happy effects of maturely thinking on our ways: One is, the ſatisfying ourſelves upon ſolid and rational grounds, that we are indeed the ſervants of God and righteouſneſs, and heirs of the promiſes; which will not only miniſter great peace and comfort to our minds, but alſo excite us to run, with more diligence and delight, the race ſet before us. The other is, that we ſhall diſcover our paſt defects, and errors, and ſo be naturally led to correct them. So that, however good we are, we ſhall doubtleſs be both the happier and the better, for carefully reviewing our paſt lives. But it is, if poſſible, of ſtill more importance for wicked men to think on their ways; becauſe this is one neceſſary and probable means, under the influence of the Spirit of God, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing them of their ſin and danger; without which, they neither will, nor
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:008667_0311_102fb10f59690140"/>
can, fly for refuge to lay hold of the hope ſet before them, and ſo eſcape the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>IT muſt not be omitted here, that in this examination of ourſelves, we ſhould uſe the utmoſt caution and impartiality. A ſlight, ſuperficial and partial one, may poſſibly be of more fatal conſequence than none at all, by leading us to form a wrong judgment concerning ourſelves, or confirming us therein. There is a certain pride, and ſelf-partiality, too na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to mankind, which makes them reluct at ſeeing the worſt of themſelves; which prejudices them in their own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and often makes them think much better of themſelves than they can do with reaſon. Of this we ſhould be aware, and carefully guard againſt it. We ſhould not endeavour to leſſen the number of our ſins, or to extenuate our faults. We ſhould conſider how "ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad the commandment" is; how numerous its branches, both nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and poſitive. We ſhould reflect, not only on our ſins of commiſſion, but of omiſſion; both what we have done, that ought not to have been done; and what we have left undone, that ought to have been done, and how often. We ſhould reflect, as much as may be, upon all the
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:008667_0312_102fb110e2370880"/>
aggravating circumſtances of our ſins; what light we have ſinned againſt; what grace and goodneſs we have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; what reſolutions and vows we have broken thro'. All theſe things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, if we would think aright on our ways, and avoid ſelf-deception. They are indeed all naturally implied in thinking on our ways, in the ſenſe of ſcripture: Which is not reflecting on them in a curſory, ſuperficial manner, with a fooliſh ſelf-fondneſs and partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but carefully ſcanning, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to the bottom; that we may truly ſee what we are, and know our moral and religious ſtate. Unleſs we are thus thorough and impartial in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ourſelves, it can be but of little benefit to us: Yea, as was intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above, it may perhaps be a prejudice to us, by leading us to a wrong conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For it were better for us to remain intirely unreſolved in our own minds, than to flatter ourſelves that we are righteous, while we are workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. And even publicans and harlots are ſaid to go into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, before hypocritical profeſſors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who have a ſtrong and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs opinion of their own goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="308" facs="unknown:008667_0313_102fb1126a010958"/>I SUPPOSE it ſufficiently appears from what has been ſaid, that men are made for thought and reflexion; that our minds are, and muſt be, almoſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually employed on ſomething or other; and conſequently, that if they are not employed worthily, they muſt be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed improperly and unworthily. If then, you aſſume the character of reaſonable creatures, and boaſt of faculties ſuperior to thoſe of beaſts, on what will you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy theſe diſtinguiſhing faculties? Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what can you employ them more worthily than on God, your relation to him, his laws, your obligation to obey them, and your paſt behaviour? Should you not ſeriouſly conſider, whether the ways you are walking in, lead to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and joy, or to miſery and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For they certainly lead either to one or the other. Can you think of any other matters, that are more worthy your attention? Any that are more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting and important? Any, on which it would better become intelligent and accountable creatures, in ſuch a ſtate as you are, to exerciſe their thoughts? If you can, you will indeed do wiſely to think on theſe things; on theſe more worthy and important matters: But if not, I beſeech you, imitate the pſalmiſt, and
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:008667_0314_102fb115957174c8"/>
think on your ways, in this day of your viſitation, before the things that belong to your peace are hidden from your eyes.</p>
            <p>IF there are any other things which are more worthy to take up your thoughts and attention, than thoſe which belong to your eternal peace; they muſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be the things of this preſent viſible world; its pleaſures, honors, riches or amuſements. Theſe are the important things, on which your thoughts will of courſe be employed, unleſs they ſhould be employed on God, your duty, your ways, and the future conſequences of them. But can you poſſibly imagine, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe are more deſerving of your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and care; and that, by thinking on them, you will act more up to your character as reaſonable creatures, than by examining your hearts and ways, as you are the ſubjects of God's moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be happy or miſerable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after according to your preſent behaviour? Is he a more reaſonable, and wiſer man, the objects of whoſe thoughts are,
<q>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life,</q>
(which are not of the Father, but of the world,) than he who daily contemplates the ſovereign Lord of the univerſe; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects ſeriouſly on his own ways? There
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:008667_0315_102fb11b8ad63f08"/>
are indeed many perſons, who live, and employ their thoughts thro' life, as if they actually imagined, theſe worldly objects were more deſerving of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, than any others, even thoſe which are heavenly and eternal. But, what folly and madneſs this is, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appear, if I give a brief deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or draw the character of ſuch a man. Nothing more than this will be neceſſary, in order to ſhow you how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, not to ſay, how guilty and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſuch a man is. And the character I am about to draw, will have nothing very ſingular in it; but in the main ſtrokes of it, will be applicable to all thoſe in general, who, neglecting to think on their ways, employ their care and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the things of this world.</p>
            <p>HERE, then, is a man, who looks with contempt on the brutes, and boaſts in the title of rational; in his intellectual and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers, and the dignity of his nature. Tho' his body is mortal, and ſhort-liv'd, his ſoul is immortal. God has plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his will to him; and he knows that he is either to live and triumph for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever with ſaints and angels in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, or elſe to be doomed, with the devil and his angels, to that place of torment, "where the worm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:008667_0316_102fb11d127ae178"/>
not, and the fire is not quenched:" And, which of theſe ſhall be his portion, he knows depends upon his conduct in this world, and the improvement he makes of the time and advantages given him to work out his ſalvation. All this he knows, or at leaſt profeſſes to believe: But how does he act in the mean time. Does he not, in conſequence hereof, conſider this world, and the things of it, as trifles, hardly worth a thought? Does he not give his whole attention, in a manner, to religion, his duty, and his behaviour, with a view to ſecure the favour of God, and eternal happineſs? No: Quite the reverſe. This reaſonable, this dignified creature, ſtill looks upon this world as all in all to him; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, his immortal ſoul, heaven and hell, as nothing, or next to nothing! He begins his life with ſin and folly, going aſtray almoſt "as ſoon as he is born ſpeaking lies." His childhood is all vanity; his youth is employed in thinking on, and enjoying, his ſinful pleaſures. The attaining of worldly honours chiefly employ his riper years. As old age comes, tho' he knows he has but a little while to live, his other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions give way to that of avarice; ſo that he hardly thinks of any thing but
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:008667_0317_102fb11efaad1670"/>
dying rich. So that in every ſucceſſive ſtage of his life, his thoughts, deſires and affections, are engroſſed by the "things which are ſeen, and are but temporal." He never thinks ſeriouſly of his ways, or the ſalvation of his ſoul. Tho' he had a chriſtian education, and lived from firſt to laſt, under the light of the goſpel; tho' often reminded of his duty, and admoniſhed by the word and providence of God, to conſider his ways, and do works meet for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; tho' warned not to neglect the great ſalvation; he ſets at naught all theſe counſels and admonitions. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe ſtill engroſſed his thoughts and cares; and ſo he dies at laſt, full of days and guilt: "And in hell he lifts up his eyes being in torment!"</p>
            <p>WHAT, my brethren, do you think of this character? Did this reaſonable creature act wiſely? Were his ſuperior faculties properly employed? I am ſure you cannot but cenſure him, as having acted a moſt abſurd and inconſiſtent, as well as imprudent and wicked part. And perhaps this is a more common cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, than you may think at firſt view. Yea, while you are cenſuring this man, you may poſſibly be paſſing ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yourſelves, as David once did, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:008667_0318_102fb1220be21570"/>
knowing it. For if you have not yet thought of your own ways, ſo as to turn your feet unto God's teſtimonies, you are in the ſame condemnation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that your mortal courſe is not yet finiſhed. What did he, which you have not done? What did he neglect to do, which you have not hitherto neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected? Did he poſtpone the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of religion, to the trivial ones of this preſent life? And do not you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Were his thoughts employed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bubbles, and fading vanities? So are thine. Did he refuſe to hearken to the admonitions of God's word and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences? You have done the ſame. Did he diſregard the great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the goſpel? And have not you diſregarded them? Did he make light of God's threatnings? But you have not effectually laid them to heart. It is plain therefore, that you have, in effect, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto acted the ſame abſurd and fooliſh part with the perſon juſt now deſcribed; and whoſe conduct you could not but condemn: So that you are really ſelf-condemned; I mean, if you have not yet thought ſeriouſly on your ways, and turned your feet unto God's teſtimonies. And altho' thro' the goodneſs, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and long-ſuffering of God, your
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:008667_0319_102fb1286cfdda50"/>
own days are not yet numbered and finiſhed, as that unhappy perſon's are ſuppoſed to be; yet are not you wiſer than he was. You are guilty of the ſame folly and madneſs: And if you perſiſt in treading in his ſteps, your end will be alſo the ſame. For doubtleſs the ſame road will lead all who travel in it, to the ſame ſtage at laſt. Or can you imagine, that thoſe ways of ſin and folly, which bring others to deſtruction, will bring you to glory, honor and immortality?</p>
            <p>LET me therefore cloſe this diſcourſe, by beſeeching you, as you judge your ſelves reaſonable creatures, and juſtly boaſt faculties far ſuperior to thoſe of brutes, to think maturely on your ways, while you have an opportunity for it, and it may be of advantage to you. Without this, to be ſure, you will not "ſhew your ſelves men", whatever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties you lay claim to; but be ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from the honorable rank, in which God hath placed you· For
<q>man that is in honor</q>, ſays the pſalmiſt,
<q>and underſtandeth not, is like the beaſts that periſh</q>.
Begin the buſineſs of ſerious reflection even now, if you have not enter'd upon it before. — What do you think of your paſt lives? What have you been hitherto doing? What road
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:008667_0320_102fb12a3a5cdb60"/>
are you now travelling in; and whither is it likely to conduct you? Can you reflect with ſatisfaction upon your ways; and approve your own conduct, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuitable to your character as reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creatures, and profeſſed believers of the goſpel, allowing for ſuch faults and imperfections as are common to good men? Purſue this important inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, as in the preſence of God, when you depart from his houſe; beſeeching him to ſearch and try you; to ſee if there be any wicked way in you, and to diſcover it to you. If you find a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance at looking into yourſelves, and the ſtate of you ſouls; yea, if you are not deſirous to know the worſt of your caſe, it is at leaſt highly probable that your ways are evil.

This is as neceſſary as it is for the mariner, whom winds, ſtorms and currents have long driven, he knows not whither, to take an <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> in order to his finding his port: He muſt know whereabouts he is in the ocean, before he can ſteer his courſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, unleſs he does it by chance. In like manner it is neceſſary, that men ſhould ſee whither they have wandered out of the path of life, in order to their returning to it again: Nor is there even a poſſibility of their going right by <hi>chance,</hi> in the latter caſe, as there is in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>BUT, for the further illuſtration of the point before us, it is to be obſerved, that as true religion is founded in reaſon, it muſt needs be the reſult of thought, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, and deliberate choice; it can never be the effect of a blind, undirected ſally of the will. You are ſenſible, it is by means of our reaſon, or the faculties of underſtanding and reflexion, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come capable ſubjects of virtue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:008667_0323_102fb135a68abad0"/>
For were we deſtitute of theſe, 'tis manifeſt we ſhould be no more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of religion than the brute creatures. Without them, we could know nothing of God, of his will, or of duty; nothing of what we are to believe as truth, or to practiſe as moral beings; we could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope nor fear any thing hereafter. And upon this ſuppoſition, it would be altogether as proper to preach the goſpel of the kingdom to beaſts, birds and fiſh, as ſome of the eminent <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſaints are ſaid to have done in their <hi>catholick</hi> zeal, as to preach it to mankind. It will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be allowed then, that theſe intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual faculties are abſolutely neceſſary in order to our being in any degree religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and that no creature, being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of them, can, in the nature of the thing, be a ſubject of piety and virtue.</p>
            <p>BUT it is not merely the <hi>poſſeſſing</hi> of theſe faculties, that is requiſite in order to the practice of religion; the <hi>exerciſe,</hi> or <hi>uſe</hi> of them, is equally neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it were poſſible for us to be religious, pious and virtuous, without actually employing and exerting theſe faculties, I ſee not why we might not be ſo, even tho' we were not poſſeſſed of them at all. They are neceſſary, no further than the uſe of them is neceſſary; and only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:008667_0324_102fb1372c6cc998"/>
it is. Whatever we are capable of, without the actual uſe of any particular powers or faculties, we are equally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, without thoſe powers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for not being exerciſed, or ſo long as they lie dormant, they are as nothing; and can have no effect. That man who never thinks of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of his ways, of his duty, and of the obligations which he is under, is doubtleſs as void of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, while thus thoughtleſs, as the beaſts of the field. All the difference is, that he has a remote capacity for religion and virtue, whereas the brutes are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have none: But at preſent, he is not more pious or virtuous than they.</p>
            <p>IT is indeed very evident, that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion conſiſts in the proper exerciſe, or due application, of thoſe faculties and powers, whereby we are originally ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the capable ſubjects thereof. For in what does religion conſiſt? What is it that denominates a man to be truly pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and virtuous? Doubtleſs religion conſiſts in knowing God and Jeſus Chriſt; in underſtanding his word and will; in believing what God has revealed; in loving him above all things; and an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual care to keep his commandments, in hope of eternal life; not as of merit in us, but as the "gift of God thro'
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:008667_0325_102fb138b287da20"/>
Jeſus Chriſt our Lord." This is a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary account of the nature of religion. From whence it plainly appears, as was ſaid before, that it conſiſts in the actual exerciſe, and right application, of our intellectual and moral powers. For what are knowledge, faith, reflexion, choice, hope, and obedience, but the exerciſe of thoſe various powers? And hence it is evident, that without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God and our ways, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to turn our feet unto his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or to keep his commandments.</p>
            <p>BUT, from theſe general remarks, let us proceed to ſome more particular ones. And here it is to be obſerved, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking on our ways, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ſhould know, in what reſpects they are evil, and need reforming. The expreſſion in the text, of turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, preſuppoſes that we have in ſome degree at leaſt, and in certain inſtances, gone aſtray from them. It implies, that we have, in ſome particulars, walked contrary to God's commandments, and violated our duty. This, I ſay, is plainly implied, or preſuppoſed, in that manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Now it may be aſked, how it is poſſible for a man, who does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſeriouſly on his ways, to know
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:008667_0326_102fb13a37e207c0"/>
which of them are evil; what duties he has neglected, and what ſins he is charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with? And if he is ignorant as to theſe points, is it not impoſſible that he ſhould forſake his ſins, and practiſe his duty for the time to come? Doubtleſs this is impoſſible. Tho' a man were ſenſible in general, that his ways had been evil, and were deſirous to reform them; yet it is obvious, that without particularly reflecting upon them, and comparing them with the rule of duty, ſo as to ſee in what reſpects they have been evil, and wherein they ought to be amended, he cannot reform them, or turn his feet unto God's teſtimonies. You ſee then, from this conſideration only, the neceſſity of thinking on our ways; and that without it, no man can poſſibly forſake his former ſins, become a true ſervant of God, and a diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER: Thinking on our ways, ſo as to be deeply ſenſible of the evil of them, is neceſſary in order to beget in us that humility, and godly ſorrow, which are eſſential ingredients of true repentance; that repentance, which is the principle, and the beginning of a new and ſpiritual life. You know that evangelical repentance implies in it, ſelf-condemnation,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:008667_0327_102fb141cb94eb88"/>
ſhame, grief, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation before God; hearty ſorrow for our ſins, that we have acted ſo fooliſhly and ungratefully; and thereby render'd ourſelves the objects of God's righteous diſpleaſure. Without this, there is no true repentance; nor can there be any thorough reformation. But is it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the nature of the thing, that without ſeriouſly thinking on our ways, we ſhould thus condemn ourſelves for them, be thus aſhamed, grieved and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before God? What foundation is there for ſelf-condemnation, grief or ſhame, antecedently to our reflecting, wherein we have done amiſs? Can thoſe things, or actions, which are not even tho't of by us, or if at all tho't of, yet not reflected on as evil, and contrary to the law of God, be to us the ground of humiliation and godly ſorrow? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they cannot. You cannot be grieved, and ſorry for your ſins, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking of them; without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that you have committed them, and ſeeing your paſt errors. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſhamed of the part you have acted, till you are convinced, by reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is a baſe and unworthy one. You cannot bewail your ſins before God, till you are deeply ſenſible of them.
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:008667_0328_102fb143a9481d80"/>
This is obvious: So that if ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſhame, and godly ſorrow, be eſſential to true repentance, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in order to our turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies; thinking on our ways is plainly neceſſary alſo to the ſame end: For without thinking on them, a man cannot thus condemn himſelf, be aſhamed and grieved, on account of what he has done.</p>
            <p>WE know not what we ought to be ſorry for, or what rejoiced at, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our paſt behaviour, without maturely reflecting upon it. Why ſhould we bewail one part of our conduct, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other, till, by ſeriouſly ſcanning and examining it, we have learned wherein it has been wrong, or criminal? If we would exerciſe that humility which becomes us; if we would condemn ourſelves to the degree we ought to do; if we would abaſe our ſelves before God, in a manner becoming ſuch ſinful creatures; to reflect in general, that we are ſinners, is not ſufficient. We ſhould conſider, how numerous and great our offences have been; how frequently we have broken God's commandments; and with what aggravating circumſtances our ſins have been attended. Slight and ſuperficial reflection, will produce only
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:008667_0329_102fb1452fd45ab0"/>
a ſlight, ſuperficial, and ineffectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. It is neceſſary that we ſhould think particularly and intenſely on our ways, in order to beget in us a deep ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row on account of them; and that, our hearts being truly broken and contrite, we may be excited in earneſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, to fly for refuge, and lay hold on the hope ſet before us.</p>
            <p>NO one will ſuppoſe my meaning to be, that we cannot be truly penitent for our ſins, and turn our feet unto God's teſtimonies, unleſs we ſo think of our ways, as actually to recollect every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance, wherein we have devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from the rule of duty, together with every minute circumſtance, by which our guilt has been enhanced, thro' the courſe of our lives. Were this indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary, there would be no tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly penitent, and reformed ſinner in the world. For who can, in this ſenſe, "underſtand his errors?" No man can remember all his ſinful deeds without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, however deſirous to call them to mind, for his humiliation. But it is both practicable and neceſſary, to be much more particular and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in reviewing our paſt lives, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting our miſcarriages, than many perſons ſeem to imagine. To be ſenſible
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:008667_0330_102fb1482b6f7220"/>
in general, that we have done amiſs, to be ſure, is not all that is poſſible, or all that is requiſite. We ſhall never abhor ourſelves, or "repent in duſt and aſhes," till we have a more particular view of our paſt ſins, and ſee ourſelves in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per colours. It is neceſſary that we ſhould ſee our ſins, in ſome ſenſe, as God ſees them, or in the ſame odious light, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to hating them as he hates them; and "breaking them off by righteouſneſs."</p>
            <p>THINKING on our ways, is plainly neceſſary in order to our having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>inducements</hi> to amend our ways, preſent to our minds, ſo as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to influence our practice. It is, in the nature of things, impoſſible for us to turn our feet unto God's teſtimonies, and to keep his commandments for the future, without ſeeing, or perceiving, the motives, proper to induce us thereto. Arguments, or motives, that are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us, are to us, as nothing; and can have no effect upon us. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal motives, by which ſinners are wrought upon, and induced to forſake their evil ways, whenever they do ſo, are theſe which follow:— The apparent unreaſonableneſs and baſeneſs of their paſt behaviour; an apprehenſion of God's diſpleaſure; a fear of future puniſhment;
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:008667_0331_102fb14ead3d2188"/>
together with the hopes of pardon and eternal life thro' Jeſus Chriſt, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of forſaking their evil ways. Theſe are the principal, and moſt uſual, if not the only motives, by which wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are induced to turn from their ſins to God. None of which can have any influence upon us, or even be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as motives, inciting us to ſuch a change of life and behaviour, unleſs we ſeriouſly think on our ways.</p>
            <p>FOR, as to the former of them: It is impoſſible the unreaſonableneſs and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinning againſt God, ſhould be any inducement to us to ceaſe from evil, unleſs that unreaſonableneſs and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is perceived by us; and it cannot be perceived, till we think on our ways. However baſe or diſingenuous a man's behaviour has been, yet without reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon it, he cannot perceive it; and, conſequently, this will be no motive with him to alter his courſe and manner of life.</p>
            <p>AGAIN: However obnoxious a man may be to God's righteous diſpleaſure, on account of his paſt ſins; yet he can have no ſenſe, no apprehenſion of that diſpleaſure, till he conſiders his ways: And conſequently, he cannot be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced hereby to reform his ways. This
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:008667_0332_102fb1503322b6a8"/>
will, as to him, be no motive at all, in theſe circumſtances, how efficacious an one ſoever it might be, if by means of reflecting on his ſins, he had a proper ſenſe of their demerit.</p>
            <p>NOR can the terrible puniſhment, which God has threatned to inflict on the impenitent workers of iniquity, have any influence, by way of motive, upon the mind and practice of that man, who does not view himſelf in the light of a tranſgreſſor, and ſee, that without repentance and reformation, he muſt finally incur this puniſhment. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fear future evil, at leaſt, not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, but in proportion to the ſenſe which he has of his evil deſerts, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his paſt tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>LASTLY here, How can the hopes of obtaining pardon and eternal life, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, induce that man to forſake his ſins, and to work righteouſneſs, who is ſo far from being burthened, and heavy laden with a ſenſe of his guilt, that he does not even think of his paſt ſins, or his need of a pardon? To thoſe who are ſenſible of their demerits, and their need of forgiveneſs, the hopes thereof will be a powerful motive; but to others it will be none at all.
<q>The whole need not the phyſician, but they that are ſick</q>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="unknown:008667_0333_102fb152419f9a88"/>FROM theſe hints it is evident, that none of the great motives to repent, and to live a new life, can have any influence upon a man, who does not think on his ways; they cannot be felt and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by careleſs, thoughtleſs ſinners. It is abſolutely neceſſary, in order to their having any weight or influence as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that the mind be duly awakened; or that a man has a juſt ſenſe of the evil of his ways, which, certainly, he cannot have without thinking ſeriouſly on them.</p>
            <p>NOW is it poſſible, in the nature of things, that ſinners ſhould truly repent, and turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies, without any motives thereto; or which is the ſame thing in effect, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thoſe which there are? This is plainly impoſſible; an abſurd ſuppoſition. No man does, or can, forſake his ſins, and work righteouſneſs, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why, or wherefore he does ſo; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having certain inducements thereto in his own mind; and ſuch as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to influence it in this manner. And it is only by means of ſerious reflexion, that theſe motives come to be perceived, ſo as to operate, and produce their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now almoſt finiſhed what was propoſed as the main buſineſs of
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:008667_0334_102fb15864cf4b48"/>
this diſcourſe; which was, to ſhow the abſolute neceſſity of thinking on our ways, in order to reforming them, and keeping God's commandments for the time to come. To this end it has been ſhown in general, that without exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our intellectual and moral powers, in thinking on God, our duty and our ways, we cannot be the ſubjects of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and virtue: That without reviewing our paſt lives, we cannot even know, wherein our ways need reforming, or whether they at all need it, or not: That reflecting on our ways, is neceſſary to beget in us that humility, and godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which are eſſential ingredients in true repentance: And laſtly, it has been ſhown, That the great motives to reform and amend our ways, can have no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our minds, nor even be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us, unleſs we firſt think on our ways, and are duly ſenſible of our guilt and danger, while we continue to break God's commandments. From all which conſiderations laid together, I ſuppoſe it ſufficiently appears to be an impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for any ſinner to turn his feet unto God's teſtimonies, without ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on his ways in the manner before explained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="330" facs="unknown:008667_0335_102fb159e8f8c500"/>BUT there is one objection, which may be thought to lie againſt this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reaſoning, concerning the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of thinking on our ways: And this muſt be obviated before we diſmiſs this branch of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>WE all ſuppoſe, at leaſt it is now taken for granted, that it is the work of the Spirit of God effectually to renew and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ſinners, or to turn them from the error of their ways to the wiſdom of the juſt. And may not God, by the influences of his Spirit, thus change the hearts of men immediately, whether they think on their ways or not? Cannot God work without means? Or can it be ſuppoſed, that man's co-operation is neceſſary in order to his being created anew unto good works, in Chriſt Jeſus, any more than to his firſt creation? How can thinking on our ways be ſaid to be neceſſary to this end, if it either muſt, or may be, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed poſſible for God to change a man's heart, and convert him, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them.</p>
            <p>NOW there are ſeveral things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with reverence to this objection.</p>
            <p>ALTHO' the influences of the bleſſed Spirit of God, are undoubtedly neceſſary in order to the effectual converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and altho' God <hi>can</hi> do all things,
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:008667_0336_102fb15b6ef9cd78"/>
which do not involve a contradiction; yet he may have eſtabliſhed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, ſuch a method of operating, even in the kingdom of grace, that we may modeſtly ſay, in a qualified ſenſe, that ſuch or ſuch a thing is impoſſible; meaning thereby, that it would be inconſiſtent with, or contrary to, what he has been pleaſed to reveal as the rule or method of his dealings with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful children of men; and not, that the thing itſelf exceeds the power of God, or involves a contradiction in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Many things are naturally poſſible, which yet are apparently inconſiſtent with what God has revealed, and what we know concerning the manner of his acting; and therefore no one ſcruples to ſay of ſuch things, that they are impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that they cannot be done, or come to paſs. Now in this qualified ſenſe at leaſt, we may, I ſuppoſe, ſay without offence, or preſumption, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man to be converted from ſin to righteouſneſs, without firſt thinking on his ways. For thro'out the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſinners thinking on their ways, is ſuppoſed to be previous to their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the error of them. God treats with ſinful men therein, as rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: He condeſcends to reaſon with
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:008667_0337_102fb15e7a075ca8"/>
them himſelf, concerning the evil of their ways, admoniſhing them to reflect on them, and to forſake them, leſt ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhould be their ruin. This is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the manner of his addreſs to them. —
<q>Come now, and let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaith the Lord.</q>
—
<q>Are not my ways equal; are not your ways une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual?</q>
—
<q>What more could have been done in my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</q>
—
<q>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions, whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit; for why will ye die?</q>
Such a kind of addreſs and expoſtulation, is frequently met with, both in the old and new-teſtament. And I appeal to every unprejudiced man, whether ſuch a manner of addreſs, does not plainly ſuppoſe the neceſſity of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflexion on our ways, as one means of our converſion; and whether this can be reconciled with the other ſuppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſinners are converted by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate exertion of the divine power on their hearts, before they are perſwaded to think on their ways, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of them? All the expoſtulations, the admonitions, the promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, of God's word, ſeem plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to awaken ſinners to ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:008667_0338_102fb1651a9ff6b8"/>
and reflexion on their ways, as preparatory to their converſion, and neceſſary to that end; tho' this, to be ſure, will not be effectual without the bleſſing of God concurring; without whom we can do nothing.</p>
            <p>AT firſt view, there may, perhaps, ſeem to be ſome inſtances, or examples in ſcripture, of ſinners being immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſtantaneouſly converted by the power of God, antecedently to their thinking on their ways, and being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to a juſt ſenſe of their guilt: But, upon mature conſideration, I believe, we ſhall find no ſuch examples. The thief upon the croſs may, by ſome, be thought one; but there in no ſufficient ground for it. It is rather to be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his condemnation and ſufferings were inſtrumental of awakening in him a ſenſe of his ſins, which, by the bleſſing of God iſſued in his converſion. That he thought on his ways, judged and condemned himſelf, is very evident from his anſwer to the guilty and hardened companion of his ſufferings, who <hi>railed</hi> on our bleſſed Saviour. For he rebuked him, ſaying,
<q>Doſt thou not fear God? ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>and we indeed juſtly</hi>; but this man hath done nothing amiſs.</q>
To ſay the
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:008667_0339_102fb166a0002380"/>
leaſt, the hiſtory gives us no reaſon to think, that the penitent thief became a penitent, without being firſt led, by the providence and Spirit of God, to a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of his ways; how ſhort ſoever the time may be ſuppoſed to have been, between that and his converſion. Tho', by the way, it is by no means cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he had been hardened and thoughtleſs till he was actually brought to the croſs, tho' this ſeems to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken for granted.</p>
            <p>AS to the apoſtle Paul; tho' there was ſomething very ſingular, and even miraculous, in the manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his converſion; yet we have no reaſon to think that he was inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly converted, when he was ſtruck down in his journey to Damaſcus; I mean, antecedently to his thinking on his ways. There is, on the contrary, great reaſon to ſuppoſe, that what happened to him at that time, was a means of awakening him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing him of his ſin; and this in order to his converſion. It is, indeed, evident from his ſtory in the new teſtament, that his turning his feet unto God's teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies, was ſubſequent to, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of, his being thus admoniſhed to think on his ways; tho' the preciſe
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:008667_0340_102fb1682516c810"/>
time of his converſion, or being born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, cannot be aſcertained.</p>
            <p>BUT what ſhall we ſay of the three thouſand, that were added to the church ſo ſuddenly on the day of pentecoſt? We may ſay, in the firſt place, that there is no certainty of their having been then converted, in the ſenſe wherein we now uſe that term, tho' they were convinced that Jeſus was <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> the anointed of God. And, in the ſecond place, that upon ſuppoſition they were thus conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet this does not militate in the leaſt degree, againſt any thing that has been ſaid concerning the neceſſity of thinking on our ways. For the apoſtle Peter had been preaching the goſpel to them, in a moſt awakening and affecting manner; whereby they were brought to ſerious reflexion. And it is expreſly ſaid in the ſtory, that when they heard him,
<q>they were pricked in the heart, and ſaid, Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</q>
Had they not thought on their ways, they would not have been thus "pricked in the heart," which implies a deep ſenſe of their ſins: So that nothing can be argued from hence, againſt what has been ſaid in this diſcourſe, concerning the neceſſity of ſerious conſideration and reflexion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="unknown:008667_0341_102fb16b844c47e0"/>I BELIEVE there are no inſtances of a quick and ſudden converſion, recorded in ſcripture, which bid fairer than thoſe mentioned above, to be examples of the converſion of ſinners, without thinking on their ways. However, neither that of the thief, that of Saul, nor that of the three thouſand, comes up to the point. It ſeems plain from the ſeveral accounts of them, that all theſe perſons did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally think on their ways, as well as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, before they turned their feet unto God's teſtimonies; though, perhaps, not ſo long before. And if any ſhould think it may be inferred from theſe examples, that perſons, in this age of the world, may poſſibly be converted almoſt inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, or in a very ſhort time from their being firſt awakened to a ſenſe of their ſins; I will not deny the inference. There may poſſibly be ſuch a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of alarming circumſtances, as, by the bleſſing of God, ſhall in a moment, as it were, produce a thorough and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving change in the heart of a ſinner, even without a miracle. This may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without inconvenience. But there was plainly ſomething preternatural and miraculous in the circumſtances of the converſion of the thief, of Saul, and of the three thouſand. That was the age
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:008667_0342_102fb16e9b490be0"/>
of miracles: And to ſay the leaſt, there is no reaſon to think, that ſuch quick and ſudden converſions have been common, ſince miracles have ceaſed in the church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This work is uſually, if not always, effected, in theſe latter times, in a more gradual way. And it is to reaſon falſely and abſurdly, to argue from thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and preternatural converſions, as ſome have done; as if we were to conceive, that other perſons who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from age to age, are uſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in as ſudden and extemporaneous a manner. For this there is no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it may be of bad conſequence for people to entertain ſuch an opinion. But it would be ſtill more abſurd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, to argue from thoſe examples, that whether ſinners think on their ways at all, or not, they may be converted by ſome ſudden impulſe, or ſecret energy, of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>THIS, if I am not extremely miſtaken, is not only a moral, but a natural impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, implying a plain contradiction. For converſion, or a turning from ſin to God, in the nature of it preſuppoſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, an awakened ſenſe of, and ſorrow for ſin. And, as was particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhown above, it is, in the nature of things, impoſſible for a man to repent of
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:008667_0343_102fb1745401f2c0"/>
his ſins, or to be ſorry for them, without thinking on his ways. That which is not even the ſubject of our thoughts, cannot, ſurely, be any ground of ſhame and ſorrow to us, or be repented of by us. And if it be a contradiction to ſay, that a man repents of his ſins without thinking on them; it is alſo a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſay, that a man may be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without thinking on his ways; ſince, as was obſerved before, converſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes repentance. And if this involves a contradiction, there is no preſumption in ſaying, that it is impoſſible, even with God himſelf; tho' I am by no means fond of making a frequent uſe of ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and would never do it at all, but with reverence and awe. It is, on all hands allowed, that even the power of God does not extend to the doing of things impoſſible in their own nature, as all thoſe are, which involve a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How much ſoever we aſcribe to the Spirit of God, in the converſion of ſinners; ſtill it may, and muſt be aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no man is or can be converted, without thinking on his ways, either for a longer or ſhorter time. Nor does God give us his holy Spirit to ſuperſede the neceſſity of this, or to render it needleſs for us to think on, and repent of our
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:008667_0344_102fb175db1d73b8"/>
ſins: But on the contrary, to awaken and excite us thereto; to convince us of ſin, to humble us for it, to make us ſee it in its proper colors, to inſpire us with an hatred of it, and the love of virtue and holineſs. Thus it is, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth ſinners from the error of their ways, to the wiſdom of the juſt, by his providence and good Spirit; ſometimes, indeed in a leſs, and ſometimes in a more gradual way; but never without awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to ſerious thought and reflexion; which is a manifeſt impoſſibility and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, as before obſerved. And this is ſufficient to my preſent purpoſe; ſince from hence appears, the abſolute neceſſity of thinking on our ways, in order to a thorough reformation thereof, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our feet unto God's teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>LET me therefore conclude this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, by beſeeching you as you are men, to ſhew yourſelves ſuch by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly on your ways and doings; ſtill comparing them with God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, the rule of your duty. I know of no more forcible argument to excite you hereto, than this, That it is indiſpenſably neceſſary to do ſo, in order to your turning your feet unto God's teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies; and ſo, in order to your eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the wrath to come, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:008667_0345_102fb177a8587dc0"/>
eternal life. It is hoped, there are none preſent, to whom it is a matter of indifference, whether their ſouls are ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or loſt: whether they are happy or miſerable, in the world to come. And if you are not indifferent about theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſurely you will not continue tho't<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of God and your ways. If wicked men now refuſe to conſider their ways, and the things which belong to their peace, there is a day approaching, which will not only awaken, but fill them with terror and amazement; and they will think on their ways when it will be too late to amend them. God will
<q>laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh</q>
—
<q>For that they hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord — therefore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</q>
O that we were all wiſe, and underſtood this; that we duly conſidered, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended our ways, while a ſpace is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us for repentance: That ſo <hi>that,</hi> which will, to irreclaimable tranſgreſſors, be a day of inexpreſſible terror, and utter perdition, might, to us, be the

<pb n="342" facs="unknown:008667_0347_102fb17f22f6b2e8"/>
end. For had thinking on our ways no kind of tendency to reform them, it could not be truly and properly ſaid, to be neceſſary in order thereto; this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſion ſuppoſing it to be a mean to the mentioned end. But it will not be amiſs to ſpeak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon this point, as was propoſed under the third and laſt general diviſion of the ſubject. Accordingly, the main buſineſs of this diſcourſe will be, to ſhow,</p>
            <p>THAT thinking on our ways has a natural tendency to reform them, or lead us to the keeping of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: So that there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe who do ſo, in the ſenſe of the text, will, like the Pſalmiſt, actually turn their feet unto God's teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and walk before him in newneſs of life.</p>
            <p>THERE ſeems to be a kind of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency between ſerious reflexion, and allowed, habitual diſobedience to God's commandments. For 'tis very difficult to conceive, how a man who duly thinks on his ways, and ſees the evil and danger of them, can poſſibly perſevere, notwithſtanding, in the violation of God's laws. And the holy ſcriptures, you are ſenſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes repreſent it
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:008667_0348_102fb1823323e370"/>
as owing to inconſideration, or a want of due attention, that men go on in their ſins. "My people doth not conſider," <note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. Ch. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> was the complaint exhibited againſt Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of old; and this is ſpoken of as the reaſon, or cauſe, of all their ſins and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in general. To this it is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, that they were ſuch a "ſinful nation, a people laden with iniquity." In which paſſage it is implied, that had they properly conſidered of God and their ways, they could not have been ſuch a ſinful people. Conſideration will either prevent men from falling into a courſe and habit of ſin; or, after they are fallen into ſuch a courſe, be a means of reforming them. And hence it is, that we are ſo frequently admoniſhed in ſcripture, to think on our ways, what we are about, and to what our doings tend. And in many paſſages of ſcripture, a connexion is plainly implied, between conſideration and amendment; as if the latter of courſe followed the former. Thus the Pſalmiſt in the text, "I <hi>thought</hi> on my ways, and <hi>turned,</hi> &amp;c. So it is ſaid (Ezek. chap. 18.) concerning the wicked man, That "becauſe he <hi>conſidereth,</hi> and <hi>turneth</hi> away from all his tranſgreſſions —he ſhall ſurely live." It is here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, not only that conſideration is, in
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:008667_0349_102fb183ba30aec8"/>
the natural order of things, antecedent to repentance and amendment, but that it is conducive thereto, as a means: So that when a ſinner becomes thoughtful and conſiderate, he is in a fair and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way to be reformed. It may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be expected, that having thought on his ways, he will now ceaſe to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and learn to do well. This is the manifeſt ſcope of many paſſages of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which it will not be neceſſary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to refer to.</p>
            <p>BUT it will be proper to be a little more diſtinct in explaining and proving this ſuppoſed connexion between think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our ways, and turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies. And a little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the point, will, I ſuppoſe, make it ſufficiently evident, that there is indeed ſuch a connexion between theſe things.</p>
            <p>THE chief, governing principles in human nature, (excluſive of worldly luſts and paſſions) are reaſon, conſcience, gratitude, fear, and hope. Now ſerious conſideration, or thinking on our ways, as this was explained in a preceeding diſcourſe, has a direct tendency to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken all theſe principles into act, and make them operate together to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſuch an effect in us, I mean
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:008667_0350_102fb186ccd2ce70"/>
our reformation. While we are thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, they lie dormant in us, or at leaſt they are not properly directed. But conſideration awakens and regulates them, in ſuch a manner, that our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment can hardly fail to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thereof.</p>
            <p>TO begin with the former of theſe principles, REASON. All vice and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion are doubtleſs contrary to reaſon; piety and virtue agreeable thereto. And if ſo, when a reaſonable creature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and this faculty is awakened, it is naturally conducive to pious and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice. Thoſe who are thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inconſiderate, do not really know how unreaſonable their practices are; and therefore ruſh blindly on in ſin, without check or bridle. But he that thinks on his ways, ſees the folly and madneſs of vice; and knows how it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him to act. His reaſon, which was before inoperative, and aſleep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now rouſed up, will perform its proper function. And one would think it impoſſible for a man to act unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the actual exerciſe of reaſon, as every one is, while he thinks on his ways in the manner ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>CONSCIENCE and reaſon are ſo near akin to each other, that they can hardly
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:008667_0351_102fb18b1d2b1250"/>
be ſeparated, tho' they do not ſignify exactly the ſame thing. Conſcience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in it a certain moral ſenſe, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal feeling, of right and wrong, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vice, in ſome ſenſe diſtinct from mere reaſon. This, however, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways awake; or rather it is generally aſleep in vicious men; and ſometimes "ſeared as with an hot iron;" ſo that very profligate and abandoned ſinners, are ſaid to be "paſt feeling." Whenever it is awake, or in exerciſe, it is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful principle of action; and will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a man to do amiſs, without the moſt bitter reproaches. Now it is by means of reflexion, and conſideration, that the conſcencies of ſinners are alarmed, and put upon exerting their proper authority. And whenever they do ſo, they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of a reformation, at leaſt in ſome degree. A ſinner, whoſe conſcience is duly awakened by thinking on the evil and danger of his ways, cannot at the ſame time, commit iniquity with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs; but will of courſe be deſirous to reform his ways; which deſire is itſelf the beginning of a reformation in him. Nor will ſuch a perſon
<q>turn again to folly,</q>
unleſs his conſcience is, by ſome means or other lulled to ſleep again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="unknown:008667_0352_102fb18e2b5f7c30"/>MOREOVER: Serious conſideration has a natural tendency to awaken our GRATITUDE to God for his goodneſs, forbearance and long-ſuffering, and ſo to lead us to repentance. Thoughtleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have no proper conception of the goodneſs and mercy of God, daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards them; nor know how baſe and diſingenuous their conduct is with regard to him. But when a man thinks ſeriouſly on his ways, he will be aſhamed, yea even confounded, that he has ſo abuſed the goodneſs of God, and made ſo ill a return to him for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. He will be almoſt aſtoniſhed, that God has been ſo patient and kind to one, who has deſerved ſo ill at his hands; and not conſumed him in his hot diſpleaſure. And when a perſon is, by reflexion, brought to ſuch a juſt and ingenuous ſenſe of things, it will naturally lead him to amend his ways. He will be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful incited to make ſome returns to God, anſwerable to the obligations he has been laid under; and to devote his future life to the honor and ſervice of his divine benefactor. If the laſt ſpark of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not quite extinguiſhed in us, ſerious conſideration will not fail to awaken it, and being awakened, it will certainly have ſome good effect upon our beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="348" facs="unknown:008667_0353_102fb18fb2fb9708"/>AGAIN: Serious conſideration has a natural tendency to awaken our FEARS, to excite in ſinners a juſt apprehenſion of the wrath to come, and, thereby, to reform them. Thoſe who do not think, do not fear God's diſpleaſure, how much reaſon ſo ever they may have for it. But when ſinners reflect ſeriouſly on their ways, they cannot but ſee that they are expoſed to the wrath of God, and know that they muſt finally experience the dreadful effects of it, except they repent, and turn their feet unto his teſtimonies. Now when a man has a juſt ſenſe of the miſery of his condition, in being an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of God's diſpleaſure, and ſees the danger he is in of being condemned in the judgement of the great day; this will make him anxious to fly from the wrath to come. A juſt fear being thus excited in him, it will be morally impoſſible for him to perſevere in his vicious courſes. All men dread miſery; and not only dread, but endeavour to avoid it, when they plainly ſee they are in danger. And this principle of fear, will operate at leaſt as powerfully in the concernments of religion, when a man really ſees, or believes his danger, as it does in thoſe of a temporal and worldly nature. So that if a man be a ſpeculative believer of
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:008667_0354_102fb192c0098968"/>
the holy ſcriptures, which is here all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long taken for granted, he muſt needs be afraid, when he thinks of his ſins; and be ſollicitous to eſcape the perdition threatned.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER: Conſideration will ſerve to awaken the HOPES, as well as the fears of wicked men. A tho'tleſs ſinner is unaffected with the bleſſed promiſes of the goſpel; and no more deſires the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it, than he fears the deſtruction which it threatens. But conſideration, at the ſame time that excites fear in wicked men, alſo awakens in them a deſire of obtaining an intereſt in God's favour, that they may be happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And the hope hereof will operate in conjunction with the fear of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; both tending to lead the ſinner to repentance.</p>
            <p>THUS it appears, that thinking on our ways is naturally conducive to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation, as it tends to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken and rouze the chief, governing principles in human nature; and make them operate conjunctly to that end. Reaſon, conſcience, gratitude, fear and hope, are, by means of ſerious reflexion, properly directed, and put into action in ſuch a manner, that it may be naturally expected, a reformation will be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence:
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:008667_0355_102fb198335cd590"/>
Whereas, while ſinners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main thoughtleſs, theſe principles can have no ſuch effect.</p>
            <p>THERE are indeed, other principles in human nature, which will in ſome meaſure counteract theſe, tending to obſtruct them in their operation, and to prevent that good effect which has been ſpoken of; I mean our ſenſual and worldly paſſions. For "the ſpirit luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the fleſh, and the fleſh againſt the ſpirit; and theſe two are contrary one to the other." We all of us "ſee a law in our members, warring againſt the law of our minds," and too often "bringing us into captivity to the law of ſin." Yea, this law of ſin that is in our members, is ſo powerful, that it will finally prevail over reaſon and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hope and fear, and every good natural principle, if we are left intirely to ourſelves. And, therefore, nothing which has been ſaid above, concerning the natural tendency of thinking on our ways, to reform us, muſt be underſtood to mean, that it will ever actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this effect, without the Spirit and grace of God concurring,</p>
            <p>IT is an undoubted truth, and doctrine of ſcripture, that ſinners, how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may think on their ways, do
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:008667_0356_102fb199c03d33f8"/>
not obtain a victory over their luſts, merely by their own power, but only thro' God, working in and with them; or thro' "ſanctification of the Spirit unto obedience." In conformity to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence with, which important doctrine, whatever has been ſaid above, is to be underſtood. Nor are theſe things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with each other. Altho' we are not able, as of ourſelves, to do any thing to purpoſe in religion; yet it may be true, that thinking on our ways is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſtep to reformation, and a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means thereof. It may be a real means hereof, and conducive to this end, altho' it be not ſuch a one, as will take effect, or be effectual to that end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the bleſſing of God. And we have great reaſon from ſcripture, to hope that, when ever wicked men are led ſeriouſly to reflect on their ways, and are heartily deſirous of amending them, God will graciouſly afford them all the aſſiſtance neceſſary hereto, ſo that the event ſhall be, their ſaving converſion to him. Being thus awakened to a juſt ſenſe of their ſin and danger, and being ſenſible of their own depravity and weakneſs, they will of courſe, implore the grace and aſſiſtance of God's Spirit, in order to the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their earthly members, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:008667_0357_102fb19b47b4c358"/>
of their hearts. And our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour has declared, that God will "give the holy Spirit to them that aſk him." So that there is a plain probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that thoſe who think ſeriouſly on their ways, will eventually turn their feet unto God's teſtimonies; and that He who has begun a good work in them, will perfect it unto the day of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>THOSE who have been awakened into a ſenſe of their ſins, and who now think ſeriouſly on their ways, may reaſonably take ſome encouragement from what has been diſcourſed above. They have great cauſe of thankfulneſs to God, that they have been rouzed from a ſtate of thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſecurity, by whatever means this has been done; and that they have at length ſome concern about their eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is a hopeful ſymptom; it is a token for good to them; and may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be followed by a throrough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from ſin to God.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever probability there may be hereof, it muſt be allowed, there is no certainty. Tho' ſuch perſons ſeem not to be far from the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they may yet never enter into it. Sinners are not, by being thus brought to think on their ways, or even by refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them in ſome degree, put beyond
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:008667_0358_102fb19e15fa5f90"/>
the poſſibility and danger of a relapſe, and ſo of finally miſcarrying. They have ground for hope, but none for confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or preſumption. It is ſuppoſed, or rather plainly aſſerted, in the holy ſcriptures, that ſome who are awakened to a great concern about their ſins, and ſpiritual ſtate, who begin hopefully, and do many things gladly, become careleſs and inconſiderate again after a time; and return to their former ſinful courſes. It is ſaid of ſome, that their goodneſs is as the morning cloud, and early dew, that ſoon paſſeth away. Some of thoſe, who are ſaid to have eſcaped the corruptions that are in the world, thro' the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, are ſuppoſed to be again entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and overcome by them: Who are compared to the "dog returning to his vomit"; and "the ſow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire." It is ſuppoſed, that thoſe may fall away, who have once been enlightened, and have taſted the heavenly gift, and the powers of the world to come; yea, thoſe that have in ſome meaſure and manner, been "made partakers of the holy Ghoſt". Our Saviour, in his parable of the ſower, ſpeaks of ſome, who receive the word with joy; but yet endure only for a time,

being by and by offended, when temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and trials come. And ſuch apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates as theſe, often, if not always, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more hardened and profligate than ever they were. So that the apoſtle ſays, it had been better for them not to have known the way of life, than thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the holy commandment deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them. And it is of ſuch perſons, that thoſe remarkable words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our are commonly interpreted, (Luke XII) "When the unclean ſpirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſeeking reſt: And finding none, he ſaith, I will return unto my houſe, whence I came out. And when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he findeth it ſwept and garniſhed.— Then goeth he and taketh with him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven other ſpirits more wicked than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And they enter in, and dwell there. <hi>And the latter ſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt.</hi>"</p>
            <p>I WOULD qualify what has been ſaid in the former part of this diſcourſe, by reminding you of theſe repreſentations in the holy ſcriptures; which ſhow the poſſibility and danger of awakened ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yea, of partially reformed ones, returning, after a time, to their vicious courſes; and dying at laſt in their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. I do not, however, ſay theſe
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:008667_0360_102fb1a64b2512b8"/>
things with a deſign to throw any need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſcouragements in the way of thoſe, who are become thoughtful, and are ſeriouſly concerned about their ſalvation: God forbid! By ſuggeſting their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to them, I mean to keep them from preſumption; to excite them to great watchfulneſs, and diligence in working out their ſalvation: Leſt becoming ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by degrees, they ſhould fall away, thro' the temptations of this evil world, and the devices of Satan; becoming more hardened and abandoned than ever, inſtead of being eventually the better for their preſent concern about their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtate.</p>
            <p>BUT, beloved, we would hope "bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things of you, and things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſalvation, tho' we thus ſpeak." There is ground of hope concerning thoſe of you, who now think ſeriouſly on your ways, tho' you are not out of danger. It becomes you both to watch and to pray, that you enter not into temptation. Depend not too much on your own ſtrength; but look up to God for his grace and aſſiſtance, in an humble ſenſe of your weakneſs. It is He only, that is able to keep you from falling, and finally to preſent you before his glorious preſence with exceeding joy. If you
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:008667_0361_102fb1a7d34a9940"/>
ſeek him with your whole heart, he will be found of you: He will afford you all needed meaſures of his grace and Spirit, for your ſanctification, and preſervation in the way of life and ſalvation. But if you forſake him, and become careleſs and thoughtleſs of the things that belong to your peace, he will alſo forſake you, and give you up to your own hearts luſt. Take heed, that you do not loſe thoſe ſerious impreſſions, which you are now, any of you, under. How ſad would be your ſtate and condition, if you ſhould return to ſin and folly, after being in ſuch a hopeful way to obtain the ſalvation of your ſouls! You doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs now look with ſome degree of pity on all thoſe, who appear to have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern about their ſins, and their eternal intereſt, if there are any ſuch amongſt us at this time. They are indeed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of pity. But if you yourſelves, after being thus awakened to a ſenſe of your ſin and danger, ſhould grow ſecure, and give yourſelves up to work iniquity, your caſe would be then more ſad and deſperate than their's is at preſent. There would then be hardly any hopes of your "being renewed again unto repentance." Good impreſſions loſt, uſually leave the heart more callous and hardened than it
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:008667_0362_102fb1ab0cdb4280"/>
was at firſt, before thoſe impreſſions were made on it. Work out your ſalvation, therefore, with fear and trembling: And may God, of his infinite mercy, work in you, and in all of us, that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; to whom be glory for ever and ever. AMEN.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now done with the third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral head of diſcourſe, propoſed to be ſpoken to: Having ſhown the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and neceſſity of thinking on our ways, together with the tendency here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to reform them. A recapitulation of the whole, with ſome reflexions on the ſubject, and on the late alarming viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Divine Providence, was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as the concluſion.

               <note place="margin">SERM XIII.</note>WHEN I firſt entered on this ſubject, I intimated to you, that I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the will of God, to handle it pretty largely: becauſe I thought it particularly ſeaſonable, and might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be uſeful at this time. I have now almoſt finiſhed what I propoſed. It ſtill remains, however, to apply the ſubject
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:008667_0364_102fb1b2db21d0e8"/>
more particularly than has been hitherto done, to the occaſion of theſe diſcourſes; I mean, the late alarming diſpenſations of providence. But as it is ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time ſince I enter'd on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; I ſhall beg leave firſt to refreſh your memories by recapitulating the principal matters which have been ſo largely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; that ſo, by the bleſſing of God, when I am diſmiſſing the ſubject, I may leave the ſubſtance of the whole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on your minds and conſciences.</p>
            <p>YOU will pleaſe to remember then, that the ſubject has been handled under three general heads, each of which has been branched into ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p>THE FIRST of theſe general heads was, To ſhow the great, yea infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, of turning our feet unto God's teſtimonies, and keeping his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And this appears evident from the ſeveral arguments that were inſiſted on in the two firſt diſcourſes: From a general conſideration of God's power and greatneſs, his holineſs and univerſal dominion, and our abſolute dependence upon him: From the clear and poſitive denunciations of his wrath, in his word, againſt all impenitent, irreclaimable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors:
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:008667_0365_102fb1b4692825e8"/>
From the great and precious promiſes of the goſpel, made to thoſe who turn at God's reproof: And laſtly, From a conſideration of that aſtoniſhing method which God has projected for our ſalvation from ſin and death. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a matter of infinite importance to us, to reverence and obey the great Lord of heaven and earth, in whoſe hand our breath is, and whoſe are all our ways. It infinitely concerns ſinners to fly from the wrath to come, that wrath of God, which is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, and revealed in language ſo full of terror. Is it not of infinite importance to us, to obtain an intereſt in the bleſſed promiſes of the goſpel, the promiſes of pardon and eternal life? And it muſt needs give us a deeper ſenſe of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, if we conſider the Son of God as coming down from heaven, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and dying for our ſalvation. The firſt point is, I ſuppoſe, ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and illuſtrated by theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were diſtinctly enlarged on in their order.</p>
            <p>THE SECOND general head of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was, To ſhow the vaſt importance of <hi>making haſte</hi> to keep God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the extreme folly and danger
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:008667_0366_102fb1b5f18e5338"/>
of <hi>delaying</hi> it. Human life is ſhort and uncertain: ſo that we cannot depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any future opportunity to make our peace with God, if we neglect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But if we were certain of another, yet delay will render the work of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation more difficult and painful. The pleaſures attending a religious and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, are far ſuperior to thoſe of ſin and folly; and the ſooner we begin to fear and ſerve God, the ſooner ſhall we begin to be truly happy. The greater alſo will be our progreſs towards chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perfection, and the greater our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven. Piety and virtue are peculiarly amiable in youth; and we ſhall do much more honor to God and our Redeemer by an early, than by a late repentance. To delay, is the baſeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. It is alſo ſuch daring impiety, that we may well fear, God will utterly withdraw his holy Spirit from thoſe, who continue long in their ſins; giving them up to their own hearts luſt, and leaving them to, treaſure up unto themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath. Theſe arguments were enlarged upon in ſeven diſcourſes; and all who duly conſider them, muſt needs acknowledge the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of <hi>making haſte</hi> to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="362" facs="unknown:008667_0367_102fb1bd75cb0ea0"/>THE THIRD general head of diſcourſe was, To ſhow the reaſonableneſs of <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our ways,</hi> together with the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and conduciveneſs hereof, to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of them. We cannot better employ thoſe rational faculties which God has given us, than by thinking ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly of our own ways; by reflecting, what manner of life we have lived; what our religious ſtate is; what we have to hope, or what to fear, in the way and courſe we are in at preſent. Certainly ſuch thoughts and inquiries become us, as we are reaſonable creatures, made for virtue and religion, and are to be happy or miſerable in another world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our behaviour in this. Unleſs we think on theſe things, we ſhall think only of ſuch as are vain and trifling in compariſon of them. 'Till we thus think on our ways, it will be impoſſible for us to a mend them, how much ſoever they may need reforming. And, on the other hand, when we properly reflect on our ways, there is ground to hope, that we ſhall actually turn our feet unto God's teſtimonies; the former naturally lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the latter. Theſe things were particularly conſidered in the three laſt diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="unknown:008667_0368_102fb1bf96ee29b8"/>THUS I have given you a brief, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary view of the manner, in which this ſubject has been handled: And ſhall now cloſe it with ſome general reflexions and exhortations; not omitting to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe diſpenſations of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which were the occaſion of my treating the ſubject ſo largely at this time.</p>
            <p>IT is ſtrange that any ſhould be tho't<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs about their ſpiritual ſtate, and their eternal intereſt, conſidering how many things daily occur to rouze us to ſerious reflexion on them. We do not live a ſingle day, without having admonitions of one kind or other, to this end. The whole viſible creation, which proclaims the perfections and glory of God, and reminds us of our dependence on him, is an inceſſant, unwearied monitor to us. The ſun, moon and ſtars preach to us, night and day: And the moſt common events of providence, are inſtructive and monitory. In which reſpect,
<q>Wiſdom crieth without, ſhe uttereth her voice in the ſtreets: She crieth in the chief place of concourſe, in the opening of the gates; in the city ſhe uttereth her words, ſaying, How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity? and the ſcorners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="unknown:008667_0369_102fb1c11e2ccec8"/>WE are ſtill more explicitly admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of our duty by the holy ſcriptures, which we have in our hands. Theſe ſacred oracles, to be ſure, are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and inſtruction in righteouſneſs. So that while we have the written word of God, yea, while the world ſtandeth, and the courſe of nature is maintained, we can never want admonitions to think of God, and of our ways, and to keep his commandments. How inexcuſable are we, if we diſregard them, and let them admoniſh us in vain!</p>
            <p>BUT beſides theſe conſtant monitors; beſides this word, and theſe works of God, which preach uninterruptedly and uniformly to the world, from age to age; beſides theſe, I ſay, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular diſpenſations of providence towards ourſelves, which ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to awaken us to a ſerious ſenſe of religion, and which, being diſregarded, leave us the more inexcuſable. All the ſignal mercies and bleſſings which God beſtows upon us, are admonitions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, to love him, and to keep his commandments. And all the afflictions, with which he exerciſeth us in the courſe of his providence, are alſo moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r nature and deſign. Indeed
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:008667_0370_102f750d55309750"/>
the holy ſcriptures more frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent afflictions and calamities, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to awaken and reform us, than they do the outward bleſſings and ſmiles of providence. In this light we ought to look upon ſickneſs, pains, loſſes and diſappointments, and all kinds of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adverſity in general. They are the corrections and chaſtiſements of divine providence; deſigned to bring us to a ſenſe of our ſins; to wean our affections from this world, and to make us ſeek our happineſs in God, and his ſervice.</p>
            <p>WE are all in common admoniſhed, in theſe ſeveral ways, to think on God and our duty, and to turn our feet unto his teſtimonies; by his works which we daily behold; by his word; by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and by his chaſtening hand. But there are ſome other viſitations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a mixed nature, ſo that we can hardly tell whether they ought to be called mercies or afflictions; which are yet plainly monitory in their deſign; loud calls to think on, and to amend our ways. I have here more particularly in view, the late earthquakes, which were the more immediate occaſion of theſe diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider the terror and amazement that earthquakes naturally
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:008667_0371_102fb1c46edda288"/>
bring with them, even tho' the harm done by them may be inconſiderable, we can hardly help looking on them as the judgments of heaven, at leaſt as intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God's righteous diſpleaſure, and warnings from him. The earthquakes which lately ſhook this part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, were not productive of any great cataſtrophe, as ſometimes happens; but they occaſioned a general terror; and indeed, we had, in the time of them, great reaſon to apprehend fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from them. God hereby threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us, and put us in fear: his hand was apparently lifted up, tho' he did not ſtrike the awful blow, which ſeemed coming upon us. And when we reflect, that our lives were preſerved in this time of viſible danger; that we were only alarmed, not deſtroyed, but delivered from threatned ruin; the viſitations, in this reſpect, ſeem kind, favourable and merciful: And the more ſo, when we conſider the great deſolations lately wrought by earthquakes in ſome other places.<note n="*" place="bottom">Liſbon, and ſome parts of Africa.</note> When we lay all circumſtances together, ſome people may poſſibly be in doubt, whether we ought to conſider theſe viſitations as judgments, or as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; whether we have more reaſon to
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:008667_0372_102fb1ca29f9ae88"/>
humble ourſelves, as being under the frowns of divine providence, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and be thankful, on account of our preſervation, when we were in ſuch apparent danger.</p>
            <p>WHICH of theſe would be the juſter ſentiment of the two, I will not be very poſitive; nor is it neceſſary to determine that point. We have plainly, on one hand, great reaſon to humble ourſelves under theſe alarming viſitations; and to look on them as warnings and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings from God, juſtly provoked at our ſins. On the other hand, we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant cauſe for praiſe and gratitude to him, that he has mercifully ſpared us; and not brought upon us the deſtruction, we had ſo much reaſon to fear. There is, in ſuch-like viſitations, a mixture of divine diſpleaſure and kindneſs? ſo that we may ſing, both of judgment and mercy, on account of them. However, I cannot but think, upon the whole, that they are much more properly called judgments, or manifeſtations of God's righteous diſpleaſure, than mercies, or tokens of his favour and kindneſs. No man looks upon pain and ſickneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his life is endangered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as bleſſings, conſidered in themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho', if his life is preſerved notwithſtanding, that is
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:008667_0373_102fb1cbb0b26e40"/>
doubtleſs a mercy, which demands his thanks and praiſes to God. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner does not conſider the ſtorm and tempeſt, whereby he is put
<q>at his wit's end,</q>
as bleſſings, or tokens of God's favour; tho', if he is ſaved from ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, he looks on this as a mercy, and giveth God thanks. The child, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, the ſubject, look on the rod, the ſcourge, and ax, ſhaken at them, as ſhown to them in diſpleaſure, not as marks of favour in the parent, maſter and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; tho' the laying of them aſide, may be conſidered as a token of kindneſs and mercy. The application of theſe ſimilitudes to the point in hand, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and eaſy. In this light, I ſuppoſe, we ought to look on theſe late viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of providence; I mean, as minatory, or as intimations of God's diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: But their paſſing over, and leaving us in the poſſeſſion of our lives, and the bleſſings of life, as before, muſt needs be acknowledged as a token of God's fatherly goodneſs and compaſſion. But, view them in what light we pleaſe, we muſt, unleſs we are mere atheiſts, ſuppoſe the general deſign of them is, to excite us to a ſerious conſideration, and an amendment of our ways; as loud pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential calls to fear God, and keep his commandments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="369" facs="unknown:008667_0374_102fb1cd761d4580"/>MANY perſons amongſt us have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs been put upon very ſerious reflexion, as well as terrified, by theſe viſitations of providence. It would indeed be ſtrange and unaccountable, if they had not had this effect; eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the repeated advices we have lately had from abroad, of the terrible and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal effects of earthquakes, attended with prodigious agitations and inundations of the ſea, to ſay nothing of ſome unuſual meteors and appearances in the heavens. Theſe things naturally bring to mind, a paſſage in the new teſtament:
<q>There ſhall be ſigns in the ſun, and in the moon, and in the ſtars; and upon the earth diſtreſs of nations, with perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the ſea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and looking after thoſe things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken.</q>

                  </gap>5, 26.</note> I will not preſume to ſay, that theſe now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, are the times and events which our Saviour predicted in this paſſage. It has generally been ſuppoſed, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was fulfilled in the things which came to paſs juſt before the deſtruction of Jeruſalem. However, to me it ſeems evident, that the prediction had a reference to times and events ſubſequent to thoſe,
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:008667_0375_102fb1cf01d521a8"/>
by what follows. It immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<q>And then ſhall they ſee the ſon of man coming in a cloud, with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and great glory. And when theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</q>
There has probably been no age or period of the world, wherein events have more nearly correſponded to this prophetic deſcription, than the preſent; tho' as was intimated before, I do not preſume to ſay, that theſe are the very times fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
            <p>BUT however that matter may be, I am almoſt confident, that theſe great and unuſual events, which have lately come to paſs here, and in other places, will ſoon be followed with ſome very remarkable changes in the political and religious ſtate of the world. If we may judge by analogy, or reaſon from what has heretofore been, to what ſhall be hereafter, we may probably conclude, that theſe great commotions in the natural world, will uſher in ſome great revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the moral world, and in the ſtate of thoſe nations and countries, where they have happened. There uſually has been, and probably will be, a kind of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſome correſpondence, between
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:008667_0376_102fb1d6605e54c8"/>
the natural, the civil and moral world: So that theſe events in the former, may it is humbly conceived, without any tincture of ſuperſtition or enthuſiaſm, be conſidered as the prognoſtications and fore-runners of ſome commotions, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncommon and ſurpriſing in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and as deſigned to give us warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. But whether theſe will, tous, be proſperous or adverſe, God only knows. <note n="†" place="bottom">IT is now (March, 1760) upwards of four years ſince this diſcourſe was delivered: And when the Author reflects on what has ſince come to paſs, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in Portugal, in the kingdoms of Fez and Morocco, and in North-America; he ſees no cauſe for changing his ſentiments, or making any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in what he then delivered, as in the above para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</note> And it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what will put men upon ſerious conſideration, if ſuch alarming viſitations of providence fail to do it.</p>
            <p>IF there are any perſons amongſt us, who are not rouſed and awakened by theſe things, it is a proof that they are ſunk into groſs impiety, but little ſhort of atheiſm. A man can hardly be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ppoſed to believe the being and providence of God, who does not regard theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his hand; and who is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited hereby to think on his ways. What will put thoſe upon ſober reflexion, on whom an <hi>earthquake,</hi> threatning inſtant
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:008667_0377_102fb1d7f2aecec8"/>
and wide deſtruction, has no effect! Will they not be perſwaded to think of their ſtate, and latter end, till they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually "ſee the ſign of the ſon of man, coming in the clouds of heaven"!</p>
            <p>LET us all, in ſeaſon, even in this day of our viſitation, conſider the things that belong to our peace, leſt they ſhould be hidden from our eyes. What has been our manner of life? What is our ſtate towards God? Are we at peace with him thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or the objects of his righteous diſpleaſure? Are we entitled to eternal life and ſalvation, or the heirs of death and deſtruction? Theſe matters are not to be poſtponed to the concerns of this ſhort and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain life. "One thing is needful:" They who properly attend to that, are truly wiſe, wiſe unto ſalvation; and they who neglect it, are chargeable with folly and madneſs. We ought not to be careful and troubled about many things: we ought not to be ſollicitous, what we ſhall eat, or what we ſhall drink, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal we ſhall be cloathed: we ought not to take thought for the morrow. But, having immortal ſouls to be ſaved or loſt, we ſhould take thought for them above all things; "ſeeking firſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his righteouſneſs."</p>

               <pb n="373" facs="unknown:008667_0378_102fb1d980e7b080"/>I DOUBT not but that moſt, or all of you, my brethren, are convinced, that it is of infinite importance to you to fear God and keep his commandments, and to make your peace with him. This you muſt do ſooner or later, or elſe periſh in your ſins at laſt. And can you think of any ſeaſon, fitter for it than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Are you ſure you ſhall have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity, the preſent time being neglected? No: You know not what a day, an hour, a moment, may bring forth! But taking it for granted, that you have many years to live, is this a good reaſon for delay? Will the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary work of reformation be eaſier to you, ten or twenty years hence, than it would be at preſent? No: far more difficult. You will not only have the more ſins to repent of, but your luſts will gain ſtrength by being ſo long indulged. Do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find more pleaſure in the ways of ſin and folly, than you would find in the ſervice of God, ſhould you now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon it? And will you delay for that reaſon? Alas! this is an abſurd imagination. The way of tranſgreſſors is hard, perplexed, full of trouble and diſquietude: and the paths of piety and virtue only, are paths of peace. Are you moſt likely to make great proficiency in
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:008667_0379_102f750a0ae3d398"/>
the ſchool of wiſdom and virtue, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into it early or late? Doubtleſs, the ſooner you begin to acquaint your ſelves with God, the better you will know him, and his righteous ways; the greater perfection in virtue and holineſs you will attain to here, and the greater happineſs and glory in the kingdom of heaven hereafter. Thoſe who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Creator in the days of their youth, moſt honor God, their Redeemer, and themſelves. It is to the laſt degree, baſe, ungenerous and ſordid, to ſpend that time, which God mercifully allows us for working out our ſalvation, in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt him. This is alſo ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious preſumption, as may juſtly provoke him utterly to forſake us; and to "ſwear in his wrath, that we ſhall never enter into his reſt." Conſider ſeriouſly of theſe things; and make haſte to keep God's commandments. To delay this, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fooliſh, always dangerous, and often fatal. Truſt not to that <hi>To-morrow,</hi> which you may never ſee; or which may find you in the regions of darkneſs and deſpair, fruitleſly bewailing your dependence upon it!</p>
            <p>I HAVE reaſon to think, that many of you were lately impreſſed with a a deep ſenſe of religion; that you then
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:008667_0380_102fb1e28791f530"/>
thought ſeriouſly on your ways, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, without delay, to turn your feet unto God's teſtimonies. This you doubtleſs did, when God "looked on the earth, and it trembled;" when you were under apprehenſions of ſudden deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But do not ſome of you find, ſince thoſe apprehenſions are over, that your concern about your ſalvation is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated? Are none of you become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, almoſt indifferent about thoſe things, which you then looked on as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of infinite importance? Do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that awakened ſenſe of religion, which you had in the time of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger? If you do, it is well; and it may be hoped, that you will no more return to folly. But if thoſe good impreſſions are already grown faint, it may be juſtly feared, they will e're long, be quite worn out, and even leave your conſciences more hardened than ever. As you value your immortal ſouls, keep alive, and cheriſh, the convictions of your conſciences. If you draw back, you will probably draw back unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. God will have no pleaſure in you; nor ſhall you have any pleaſure or comfort in yourſelves; but you will mourn at the laſt, when ſorrow will be unavailable. "He that being often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:008667_0381_102fb1e40d9e5bd0"/>
hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy."</p>
            <p>IN fine: LET us all in common think ſeriouſly of our ways, and amend them without delay. Let the wicked alter the general courſe and tenor of their lives; returning to God with their whole heart; and doing works meet for repentance. And let good men carefully examine themſelves, reforming their ways in thoſe particular inſtances and reſpects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are blameable. Let us all be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, by the diſpenſations of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards us, to attend to the great concerns of religion, and another world, with more care and diligence, with more conſtancy, and intenſeneſs of application, than ever:
<q>Knowing the time, that now it is high time to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of ſleep; for now is our ſalvation nearer than when we belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand: Let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſs, and put on the armour of light.</q>
Being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God as dear children, we ſhall in due time inherit the promiſes, which in Jeſus Chriſt are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> He will at length appear for the compleat and eternal ſalvation of thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
