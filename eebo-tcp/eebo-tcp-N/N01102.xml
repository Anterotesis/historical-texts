            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> returned from the Mount, unto this Idolatrous People, this was One of the awful Demands, which he brought from Heaven unto them; <hi>Therefore now Put off thy Ornament from thee.</hi> The Chaldee reads it; <hi>Put off thy Armour.</hi> And, if it be ſo read, it ſeems the Language of a Provoked General, Ordering the <hi>Rebellious Legions</hi>

Or, if we rather ſay, <hi>Put off thy Ornaments,</hi> it looks like a Maſter Ordering a <hi>Slave</hi> to be Stript, that he may then Reſolve, Whether to Puniſh him or no, according to his Demerits. It adminiſters occaſion, by the way, to let fall an Admonition concerning a Fault which is too common among us; On our Dayes of HUMILIATION many of our People ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with too gay <hi>Ornaments</hi> upon them. If <hi>Sack cloth</hi> of old, (the ſame with <hi>Sagum,</hi>) a <hi>Black rough Garment</hi> made of <hi>coarſe</hi> Wooll, (called, <hi>The Garment of Sorrow</hi>) was thought the only <hi>Suitable Habit</hi> for ſuch Dayes, I would beſpeak your Plaineſt, Meanneſt, Humbleſt Habit for them.

            <p>In the world before the Flood, we read of <hi>Two</hi> Generations.

I Speak Significantly; Sinner, ſuch, even ſuch a <hi>Monſter</hi> would be thy very <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem.</hi> There is no Sinner, but from his very <hi>Birth,</hi> every thing is <hi>Out of Order</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>Is not an <hi>Hater of God,</hi> an <hi>horrible Object</hi>? No Good Man can without Horror think of ſuch an Object. But ſuch an one is every Unrenewed Sinner, every Unrepenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We read, Rom. 1.30. They are
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001314_0008_0FB276F357ED7148"/>
               <hi>Haters of God.</hi> Vile Things are to be ſpoken of thee, O Thou <hi>Hater of God,</hi> thou <hi>Monſter</hi> of the World!</p>
            <p>We generally decry a man, who <hi>Loves none but himſelf.</hi> A Sinner not changed by Grace, comes under this Character. He ſets up <hi>himſelf</hi> at his GOD. He does nothing but for <hi>himſelf. Self, Self</hi> lies at the bottom of all his <hi>Deſigns,</hi> all his <hi>Actions,</hi> all his <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We generally decry a man who is <hi>Ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to his Benefactor. This is the Black Character of a Sinner, whom Grace has not made a change upon. His <hi>Ingratitude</hi> unto GOD, who <hi>Keeps</hi> him, who <hi>Feeds</hi> him, who, <hi>daily Loads him with his Benefits,</hi> tis the moſt abominable Thing that ever was heard of. He is alwayes <hi>Reproaching the Lord,</hi> whom every Moment he lives upon.</p>
            <p>How <hi>Deformed</hi> were a <hi>Man</hi> turn'd into a <hi>Dog,</hi> a <hi>Swine,</hi> a <hi>Serpent!</hi> So is the Unrenewed Sinner Painted in the Book of God!

Ah, Fooliſh Sinner! He has the <hi>Wit</hi> to do &amp; Speak ingenious things without Number: But he has not the <hi>Wit,</hi> to Encounter the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Satan</hi> againſt him.

            <p>Secondly: Some are <hi>Adorned</hi> with a <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Temper</hi> They are ſo Good-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo Good-humoured, ſo Obliging, that they may be ſtyled, as One was, <hi>Delicium humani generis</hi>; The <hi>Delight</hi> of all that Converſe with them.

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. Some are <hi>Adorned</hi> with <hi>Good Breeding</hi>; They have been <hi>Well-bred</hi>; have had a <hi>Polite Education.</hi> They have a Civil, a Decent, in one Word, which comprehends <hi>all the Rules of Behaviour,</hi> A MODEST Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; They Behave themſelves Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely, that is to ſay, <hi>Modestly,</hi> on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

They whoſe <hi>Manner</hi> it is, to do nothing but <hi>Sin,</hi> are guilty of <hi>Ill-Manners.</hi> The <hi>Manners</hi> of all Impious People, are the worſt of <hi>Manners.</hi> They <hi>Corrupt Good Manners</hi>; they <hi>Caſt off Good Manners,</hi> and the thing that is <hi>Good.</hi> It may be ſaid unto them; Jer. 22 21. <hi>This hath been thy manner from thy Youth, that thou Obeyed not my Voice.</hi> Ah, <hi>Ill bred</hi> Sinner! A Sinner that Misbehaves himſelf in every <hi>Buſineſs</hi>; in every <hi>Company.</hi> A Sinner that goes about

every Good Thing, with a very <hi>Misbecoming</hi> Awkwardneſs. Oh! Thou <hi>Accustomed to do Evil; <hi>Put off thy Ornaments.</hi>
               </hi> Thou doſt nothing <hi>Right</hi>!</p>

To little Purpoſe, if they are not <hi>Rich towards God.</hi> A <hi>Wealthy</hi> man, if he be a <hi>Wicked</hi> man, he is worth <hi>nothing.</hi> A <hi>Rich</hi> man, that has made no Proviſion for <hi>Eternity,</hi> may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a <hi>Laodicean</hi> Rebuke; Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt, I am Rich; &amp; knoweſt not, that thou art Wretched &amp; Miſerable, and Poor, and Blind, and Naked.</hi> We may, unto ſuch a Sinner, Invert the Words to the Angel of <hi>Smyrna; I know thy Riches, but thou art Poor.</hi> A <hi>Lazarus</hi> is <hi>Richer</hi> than the <hi>Richeſt</hi> Sinner in the World: A <hi>Rich Man,</hi> but a <hi>Rich Fool</hi>! A <hi>Rich Man,</hi> but one that has a <hi>Poor,</hi> Needy, Starving Soul within him; A <hi>Rich Man,</hi> but One that may <hi>Dy this Night,</hi> and leave all, and he has laid up nothing for Eternity! Such a <hi>Craeſus</hi> is but a Wretched <hi>Beggar.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Baſilius</hi> with his two hundred thouſand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of <hi>Gold,</hi> (according to <hi>Zonaras,</hi> which

               </hi> Thy <hi>Poor, Poor, Poor</hi> Soul, is a <hi>Priſoner in a Dungeon</hi>!</p>
            <p>Sixthly. There are Some <hi>Adorned</hi> with <hi>Honourable Relations</hi>; They are well <hi>Related</hi>; They have <hi>Relatives</hi> of ſome Account. They are of <hi>Credible Families.</hi> Their <hi>Anceſtors</hi> were Perſons of Renown. They are Allied unto Perſons of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Intereſt. Such <hi>Eſcutcheons</hi> are <hi>Ornaments.</hi> But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Friend; There is a deſperate <hi>Blot</hi> in them, if thou art not a <hi>Child of God.</hi> It was a ſad Word, Spoken to Some, that boaſted what <hi>Family</hi> they were of; Joh. 8 44 <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil.</hi> What Signifies a Mans being of a <hi>Good Houſe</hi>; if he belong to <hi>the Houſe of the Wicked</hi>! What Signifies the <hi>Generation</hi> a man is of, if he be One of <hi>the Generation of the Wrath of GOD</hi>? If thy Progenitors have been Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, their <hi>Eminency</hi> will be but an Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy <hi>Degeneracy. — At non ille Satum, quo te mentiris.</hi> — A <hi>Sinful Offspring</hi> of ſome gracious Progenitors, make themſelves viler than a <hi>Spurious Offspring.</hi> Silly Trifler; <hi>Put off thy Ornaments.</hi> If <hi>Satan</hi> be thy <hi>Father,</hi> and all the <hi>Slaves of Satan</hi> be thy <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> tis no matter who elſe may be thy <hi>Relatives.</hi>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:001314_0016_0FB2770A8A424C08"/>Seventhly. There are Some <hi>Adorned</hi> with <hi>Beauty:</hi> They are very <hi>Beautiful</hi>; Their <hi>Complexion,</hi> their <hi>Proportion,</hi> their <hi>Aſpect,</hi> is very grateful. All that are not <hi>Blind,</hi> Look upon this as an <hi>Ornament.</hi> But I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a moſt humbling Word; Prov. 11.22. <hi>As a Jewel of Gold in a Swines Snout, ſo is a fair Woman without Diſcretion.</hi> An <hi>Adorned Swine!</hi> What an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncouth Sight</hi> is That? They that are not yet <hi>Renewed in the Spirit of their Mind,</hi> alas, they have Sinned away all their <hi>Beauty.</hi> Every thing is <hi>Irregular</hi> in them. Their <hi>Eyes</hi> are cloſed with <hi>Filthy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</hi> They are ſo <hi>Lame,</hi> that they take none but <hi>Wrong Steps</hi>; they are ever <hi>Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi> They have a naſty <hi>Leproſy</hi> on them; from the <hi>Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, nothing but Wounds, and Bruiſes, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying Sores<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Crookedneſs</hi> is Look'd on as an <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in Heart.</hi> But a <hi>Well ſhaped Body</hi> will not cover thy Diſgrace, Child, if thou art One of the <hi>Crooked, and Perverſe Nation. Stammering,</hi> tis a very abaſing Imperfection; a very uneaſy Infirmity. Our Saviour <hi>Sigh'd,</hi> when he ſaw a man Troubled with it. A Learned Man has Written a Diſcourſe to prove, That it was the Great Apoſtles, <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh</hi> But the Sinner, who does not <hi>Keep his Tongue from Evil,</hi> is much worſe than any <hi>Stammerer.</hi> Uncomely Sinner; <hi>Put

off thy Ornaments</hi>; Thy <hi>Sin</hi> puts all out of <hi>Shape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly; I leave to the <hi>Laſt</hi> of all, that which is truly to all Judicious People the <hi>Leaſt</hi> of all; There are Some <hi>Adorned</hi> with <hi>Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Apparrel.</hi> Their <hi>Garments</hi> are their <hi>Ornaments.</hi> The <hi>Meaneſt</hi> of all <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are perhaps their <hi>Only <hi>Ornaments.</hi>
               </hi> Perhaps they count ſome things to be <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,</hi> which the Sober and the Vertuous in all Ages have decried, as not being the <hi>Spots of the Children of God.</hi> Particularly, The <hi>Spots</hi> which disfigure the Faces of ſo many Gentlewomen in our Days, have in all former Ages been decried by all Pious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as <hi>Blemiſhes,</hi> and <hi>Vanities,</hi> altogether misbecoming the <hi>Children of God</hi>: altogether improper for <hi>Baptiſed Faces</hi>! Children, Waſh them off, with the <hi>Tears</hi> of true Devotion. Thoſe <hi>Tears</hi> would certainly do it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the <hi>Coſtly Rigging</hi> of ſome at one time upon them, is more than they have laid out for the <hi>Special Service of God,</hi> in many years together. Alas, what is the Lady <hi>Bernice,</hi> in her <hi>Great Pomp,</hi> with all her <hi>Jewels</hi> upon her? A meer <hi>Shining</hi> piece of <hi>Rottenneſs.</hi> But the Word of God has told you of <hi>Better Ornaments</hi>; 1 Pet. 3 4, <hi>The Ornaments of the Interiour, — the Spirit; which are of great price in the Sight of God.</hi> Children, If you are without thoſe <hi>Ornaments,</hi> You are as bad as without all <hi>Ornaments.</hi> While you are

            <p>AND now, <hi>Hear the Concluſion of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> My Children, Be prevailed withal to Seek the <hi>Beſt Ornaments</hi>; The <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> without which, you Forfeit, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, and Blemiſh, and for ever Nullify all your other <hi>Ornaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Hearers, Will you mind what I ſay?</p>
            <p>I ſay, Firſt; That you muſt not value your ſelves on any <hi>Pretended <hi>Ornaments</hi>,</hi> while you are <hi>Yet in your Sins.</hi> No; See your ſelves; Loathe your ſelves; Be not Angry if <hi>Others</hi> caſt much <hi>Contempt</hi> upon you. Make thoſe <hi>Lamentations</hi>; Lam. 5 16. <hi>The Crown is fallen from our Head, wo unto us that we have Sinned.</hi> Retire, Ponder, Fall into Heart-breaking Soliloquies;
<q>
                  <hi>Lord, what am I</hi>? Nothing but a Lump of <hi>Deformity</hi>; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an heap of <hi>Abomination</hi>!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:001314_0019_0FB277138BC07410"/>I ſay, Secondly: That if you make but a little Show of <hi>Other <hi>Ornaments</hi>,</hi> yet <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Piety</hi> will make you Incomparable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Holineſs,</hi> t'will make you the <hi>Excellent of the Earth.</hi> So we are taught; Prov. 12.26. <hi>The Righteous is more Excellent than his Neighbour.</hi> Suppoſe a Perſon to be of the <hi>Common Rank,</hi> of no Secular Advantages; but One that betimes turns to God; an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Early Religion</hi>; One Devout, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Prayerful; <hi>Ready to every Good Work</hi>; One Humble, Honeſt, Induſtrious; full of all Goodneſs, and Kindneſs to all about him. Truly, the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of ſuch an One, will beſpeak an uncommon Reſpect for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People of God. Verily, Such Perſons are themſelves the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of the Societies whereto they belong; They are, (as a Good Man was once called, <hi>Monile Eccleſiae</hi>) the <hi>Jewels</hi> of the Church; they are the <hi>Stars</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p>I ſay, Laſtly. Then, <hi>Children,</hi> make your <hi>Choice.</hi> We read, Pſal. 45.13. Of, <hi>A Kings Daughter all glorious within.</hi> The <hi>Ornaments</hi> which will render you <hi>all glorious Within</hi>; Oh! make <hi>Choice</hi> of theſe; your Choice of them will render you the <hi>Adorned</hi> Children of God. Let the <hi>Ornaments</hi> that you will Chuſe and Seek, be, The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of a Glorious CHRIST: A <hi>Reſemblance</hi> to that Glorious Lord; An <hi>Obedience</hi> to that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001314_0020_0FB277170B6C7810"/>
Glorious Lord; A <hi>Patience</hi> under all His Mortifying Diſpenſations; An <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of all <hi>Sin</hi> againſt Him; A <hi>Diſpoſition to <hi>Do Good</hi>,</hi> and Know no <hi>Pleaſure</hi> equal to <hi>That.</hi> You are called upon; Phil 4.8. <hi>Whatſoever Things are Lovely! Think on theſe things.</hi> Children, Theſe things are <hi>Lovely,</hi> and will make you <hi>Lovely.</hi> Go to the Glorious LORD for ſuch <hi>Ornaments.</hi> Ask them of Him, who gives them <hi>Liberally,</hi> to them that ask them. Ask His <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which He <hi>Gives to them that ask Him,</hi> and then you have them Liberally. Be importunate in your Supplications; <hi>Oh! my God, Let thy Holy Spirit, Poſſeſs me, Renew me, Incline me, and Adorn me wonderfully.</hi> My Child; The next Smile of Heaven upon thee, will be that; Iſa. 60.1. <hi>Ariſe, and Shine; for thy Light is Come; and the Glory of the Lord is Riſen upon thee</hi>: Thy <hi>Ornaments</hi> are <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful!</hi>
