      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

really happy. And hence, it is to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a good <hi>Omen,</hi> a token for good, that thoſe who are ſet in the higheſt and moſt exalted Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Stations among this People, do not only permit and allow, but call the Meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts, the Diſpenſers of his holy Word, to be their Remembrancers, to put them in mind of the will of GOD, and their Duty, who do An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually introduce the weighty buſineſs &amp; affairs of this Day, not only by ſolemn Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, to the Prayer-hearing GOD; but alſo by giving attention unto the Word, which is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, and for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs. And the Tribes do come up, the Tribes of the Lord, to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Iſrael. Perſons of all Ranks, Orders and Degrees come up to the Sanctuary of the Lord, and preſent themſelves before the moſt High GOD, practically ſaying with them, in Luke 3.14. <hi>And what ſhall we do?</hi> Well, the words which have been now read do lay before all ſorts of Perſons their Duty, and ſhow them what they are to do in their ſeveral Places and Capacities, to promote the beſt Intereſt of the People amongſt whom they dwell.</p>
            <p>Theſe words are contained in an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> that was written by the great Apoſtle &amp; Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> unto his Son <hi>Timothy.</hi> That admirable Perſon who after he had been a violent Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Chriſt, became a zealous Preacher of him, did labour abundantly to advance his cauſe; and had the intereſt of Religion, continually lying very much upon his heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002841_0006_0FE674CDDE67A548"/>After he had planted a Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he having occaſion to depart from thence, and go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to promote the work of the Lord there, beſought <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide ſtill in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for the better ordering, inſtructing and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church there; and when he was abſent from him, he wrote this <hi>Epistle</hi> to him to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and inſtruct him in his work, and ſhew him how to behave himſelf in the Houſe of GOD.</p>
            <p>And having directed him in the <hi>firſt Chapter,</hi> how to maintain the Truth of the Goſpel, and defend it againſt the Teachers of the Law, and ſhewed him how to ſtate the true uſe and end of the Law, which being rightly underſtood and uſed is not contrary, but conſonant unto the Goſpel; He does in this <hi>ſecond Chapter,</hi> teach and inſtruct him with reſpect unto divine Worſhip.</p>
            <p>In the words of our Text, with which the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter begins, we have a very ſerious and pathetical Exhortation. And here we may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Perſon Exhorting,</hi> viz. The holy and inſpired Apoſtle. <hi>I exhort</hi> (ſaith he) or <hi>deſire,</hi> as it is in the Margin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Duty exhorted to</hi>; or what it was the Apoſtle ſhewed his concern to have done, and that was, <hi>That ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks ſhould be made.</hi> Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Prayers for the ſupply of wants: Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions for others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And giving of Thanks for good things beſtowed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whom this Duty doth concern</hi>; or who are to be employed herein. And the Apoſtle doth not only call upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> to perform this duty,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002841_0007_0FE674F46C0BECB8"/>
and attend this part of worſhip. Nor doth he only call upon him to put others upon it: but he exhorts <hi>That prayers be made,</hi> &amp;c. intimating, that <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhould not only do it himſelf; but alſo put others upon doing of it. Miniſters muſt not only give themſelves to Prayer; but alſo put all others upon this duty, and ſtir them up to it, as they have opportunity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>weight and ſtreſs</hi> that the Apoſtle lays upon it. I exhort that <hi>firſt of all,</hi> or <hi>principally</hi>: intimating, that it is a neceſſary duty that muſt not be neglected.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>To lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life, is, to be freed from War, and all Moleſtation from Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> When a People hear the ſound of the Trumphet, and the Alarm of War; when the Enemy is at the gate; when they are beſet and aſſaulty by their Adverſaries, ſo that there is no ſafety for him that comes in, or for him that goes out; when they are often hearing of Garments rolled in blood; or if they only hear the rumors of War, they do not live quietly and peaceably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But when they have no Enemies to moleſt them;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002841_0010_0FE674CF8042F0B8"/>
when there is no breaking in, nor going out; when they ſit every one under his vine &amp; figtree, and there is none to make them affraid: they lead a quiet and a peaceable life. And altho' this may not be what is immediately intended in our Text; yet, Happy is the People that is in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To lead a quiet and a peaceable life, is, <hi>To be ſecured and protected in the peaceable and quiet enjoyment of their Rights, Liberties and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges.</hi> As there are Enemies without, who do often draw the Sword againſt them, and moleſt, and diſquiet a People: ſo there are many within them, and among themſelves, or elſe-where, who would diſpoſſeſs them of their Eſtates, or deprive them of their Liberties &amp; Privileges: but when they are protected and defended in the quiet and peaceable poſſeſſion of their own Rights, and have their invaluable Liberties and Privileges ſecured unto them, and they enjoy them quietly, they may be ſaid to lead quiet and peaceable lives.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To lead quiet and peaceable lives, is, <hi>to Live quietly and peaceably together.</hi> When they are at Peace among themſelves, and live quietly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; when Families live Peaceably &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; when there is peace and quietneſs in Towns and Churches; and in all Societies among a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they may be ſaid to lead quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives. And this is what they are required and commanded to do. 1 Theſ. 4.11. <hi>Study to be quiet.</hi> And in Heb. 12.14. <hi>Follow peace with all men.</hi> Rom. 12.18. <hi>If it be poſſible as much as in you lyeth, live peaceably with all men.</hi>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002841_0011_0FE674F7C12A2438"/>II. <hi>What is it to live in the due exerciſe and practice of true Godlineſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It implies, <hi>their being like unto GOD.</hi> To be godly is to be like GOD, and the more like unto GOD any are, the more godly are they. Altho' Men have loſt the Image of GOD, yet that glorious One hath of his rich Grace ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things, that they may be renewed in his Image. Col. 3.10. <hi>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</hi> They have thoſe divine Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Diſpoſitions infuſed into them, and implanted in them which render <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>em like unto GOD, and ſo they are made Partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; as it is expreſſed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Now when they have the Image of GOD renewed in them, thoſe Graces implanted in them, which are the fruits of the Spirit of GOD, and live in the exerciſe of theſe Graces, ſo as to ſhew forth the virtues and praiſes of him who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in all his imitable excellencies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, treading in his ſteps, and following his example: This is to live in the exerciſe and practice of godlineſs. And this is what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and commanded, Math. 5.48. <hi>Be ye perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> And in 1 Pet. 1.16. <hi>Be ye Holy for I am Holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To be godly, or to live in the exerciſe of godlineſs, is, <hi>to ſtudy &amp; endeavour to pleaſe GOD in all that they do.</hi> And this implies, their ſhunning and avoiding what is diſpleaſing to GOD, and ſo their departing from Iniquity, and forſaking every
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002841_0012_0FE674CFA861E018"/>
way of Sinning; for Sin is that abominable thing which the Soul of the Lord hates, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.4. And their ſtudying and endeavouring to know what GOD would have them to do in every ſtate and condition, and under whatever circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are; and when they know what GOD would have them to do, apply themſelves to the performance of it; and ſo endeavour to do always the things that pleaſe GOD, and in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as will be acceptable to him: and ſo devote themſelves entirely to him. This is to live in the exerciſe of godlineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is to live and walk with GOD.</hi> To live godlily is to think and meditate much on GOD, to thirſt for GOD, even for the living GOD, and follow after him from Duty to Duty, and from Ordinance to Ordinance, and ſo walk in all his Ordinances, drawing near to him in all the ways of his appointment, never being ſatisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented before they find him, and ſit under his ſhadow with great delight, and find his fruit to be very ſweet and pleaſant unto them. This is to live in the exerciſe &amp; practice of true godlineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>What is it to live Honeſtly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This hath reference to our carriage &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards Men. And ſo <hi>Men live honeſtly, when they are ſincere and plain-hearted in all their dealings with one another</hi>; not only their trading and commerce, but alſo in the diſcharge of every duty that they ought to perform towards one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: when every one looks at the good of others, as well as his own; according to that in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Look not every man on his own things; but every
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002841_0013_0FE674F7E79E6908"/>
man alſo on the things of others.</hi> And when they have their converſations towards one another in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom; but by the Grace of GOD, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We may conſider, <hi>How it appears that this is the best thing than can be deſired &amp; wiſhed for, with reſpect unto a Profeſſing People</hi>? And ſo that this is what all ſorts of Perſons among them ſhould be ſollicitouſly concerned about, that they may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty. Now this will appear if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When a People do lead ſuch a life, and live in the due exerciſe and practice of godlineſs and honeſty, <hi>The Name of GOD is greatly honoured and glorified.</hi> There is nothing to be thought of that is of ſo great Importance and Concernment, as that whereby GOD is honoured and glorified: for he is Infinitely worthy of it, who is the chief and ſupreme good, the firſt Cauſe &amp; the laſt End of all things; a Being full of all poſſible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and hath made all things for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own glory, and laid all Men, and eſpecially his own People under infinite Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to honour and glorifie him. They are a People whom he hath formed for himſelf, that they might ſhew forth his praiſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.21. And they have peculiar advantages to honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie GOD. And hence, it is not a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference whether GOD be honoured by them or no; but it is of abſolute neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Now the more quiet and peaceable a People
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002841_0014_0FE674D3ADA6D420"/>
are, and the more there is of true godlineſs and honeſtly among them, the more is GOD honoured and glorified by them. When the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD are obeyed by them, and they manifeſt their care to pleaſe GOD, then he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts himſelf honoured and glorified by them; their hearts are ſet upon honouring and glorifying of GOD, and they do advance his declarative glory. Whereas on the other hand, GOD is greatly diſhonoured by a People, when they live in ſtrife and contention, and when impiety and diſhoneſty prevails among them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Peoples leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, <hi>will tend very much to their own great Benefit and Advantage.</hi> They cannot poſſibly do any thing that will tend ſo much unto their own good as this will, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And that whether they are conſidered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, and particularly: Or, as a People. As for particular Perſons amongſt a People, there is nothing will promote their Intereſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo much as their living in the practice of true godlineſs and honeſty: for herein they will find that Pleaſure, Sweetneſs and Satisfaction, which will ſufficiently reward them for all the care and pains they take to live holily and godlily. And for a few years Service here, they will be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with an Eternity of bliſs and happineſs in the coming world. And then the more there is of godlineſs and peace, and honeſty among a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the better it will fare with them in all reſpects, and upon all accounts, as they are a People.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002841_0015_0FE674FE12C2F698"/>1. If a People would live in the exerciſe of godlineſs and honeſty, <hi>They would hereby be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from amazing Judgments and Calamities.</hi> It is accounted a terrible thing to ſmart under aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judgments and Calamities. A People are very apt to grown under them; and they account it an happy thing to be freed therefrom. And as Sin does procure them all. Jer. 4.18. <hi>Thy way, and thy doings have procured theſe things unto you</hi>: ſo if a People would live in peace and in the practice of godlineſs and honeſty, they would be ſafe and out of danger of Judgments or Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. When there was a deſtroying Judgment coming upon the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> it was declared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that if there could have been found <hi>Ten</hi> godly Perſons among them, the whole city ſhould be ſpared for the ſake of thoſe <hi>righteous Ones,</hi> Gen. 18.32. whereby it is intimated unto us, what bleſſings godly Ones are to the Places where they dwell, and how much they do to ſecure ſuch Places from Judgments and Calamities. And therefore if a People were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Peaceable, and Godly, and Honeſt, they would be ſecure from, and out of danger of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Calamities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This would exceedingly promote their Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</hi> Deut. 29.9. <hi>Keep therefore the words of this Covenant and do them, that ye may proſper in all that ye do.</hi> Piety and Honeſty is the beſt Friend to outward Proſperity; and hereby the Proſperity of their Souls alſo would be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promoted; their Souls would proſper and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; they would proſper in every thing that they ſet their hearts, or their hands unto.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002841_0016_0FE674D3DCC9F308"/>3. <hi>It would be very much to their Honour and Credit,</hi> to live peaceably in the exerciſe of true godlineſs and honeſty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. As Sin brings a People low, brings ſhame and reproach, and contempt upon them: ſo holineſs and godlineſs lifts a Nation high, makes them honourable in the eyes of GOD, &amp; of other Nations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.13. They ſhall have honour among their Neighbours.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This would engage and ſecure the gracious Preſence of GOD with them.</hi> As it is a very dreadful and ruining thing unto a People to loſe the preſence of GOD, to have that glorious One depart from them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.12. So the Enjoyment of the gracious &amp; favourable preſence of GOD will render a Perſon or People truly happy. If GOD be with them, and for them, they need not care who is againſt them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31. Their having their Garners filled, affording them all manner of ſtore; their Sheep bringing forth thouſands, and ten thouſands in their Streets, and their Oxen ſtrong to labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not render them ſo happy as their having GOD in the midſt of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. latter end. And if they live in peace, the GOD of love and peace ſhall be with them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. And if they live and walk with GOD in the due exerciſe and practice of all true godlineſs and honeſty; the Lord will certainly be with them, 2 Chron. 15.2. <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him.</hi> And ſo there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can more promote a Peoples intereſt, and be more profitable and gainful to them, than their living in peace, and in the exerciſe and practice of true godlineſs &amp; honeſty.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002841_0017_0FE674FE36F55600"/>3. <hi>If a Profeſſing People do not live quietly and peaceably in the practice of godlineſs and honeſty, they give the Lie to their profeſſion.</hi> A profeſſing People are in <hi>Covenant</hi> with GOD: they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Baptiſmal Vows</hi>; and they are often lifting up their hands to the living GOD, and ſwearing Allegiance unto him: And what do they vow and promiſe and engage to do, but to ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the days of their lives And therefore if they do not live in the Practice of Godlineſs and Honeſty, they flatter GOD with their Mouths, and lie unto him with their Tongues: they are not ſound in his Statutes, nor ſtedfaſt in his Covenant; but break thro' the ſolemn Bonds which they have laid themſelves under; and are lying Children.</p>
            <p>DOCT. II. <hi>Civil Rulers, or thoſe who are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over a People, are to do much to promote and further their leading a quiet and peaceable Life, in all godlineſs and honesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They may do much to promote this; and they ought to do it: They have great opportunities and advantages to do it; and they are under the greateſt and ſtrongeſt obligations imaginable here-unto.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>They</hi> may <hi>do much to promote and further a Peoples leading a quiet and peaceable Life, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> It is remarked concerning the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in Judges 2.7. <hi>That they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Lord all the days of Joſhua</hi>: to ſhew the good influence which good Magiſtrates have upon
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002841_0018_0FE674D652992390"/>
a People, and how much they may do to promote their ſerving of GOD.</p>
            <p>And there are many ways wherein they may very much promote their Peoples leading of ſuch a life, &amp; promote godlineſs &amp; honeſty among them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By making of good &amp; ſuitable Laws.</hi> As it is one branch of the Power of Civil Rulers to make Laws; ſo it hath always been found very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have ſuch Laws enacted as will tend to reſtrain Perſons from Impiety and Diſhoneſty, and to conſtrain them to do juſtly, &amp; live honeſtly, and in the exerciſe of Piety. And Civil Rulers may do much to promote that which is ſo deſirable among a People, by taking care to have good and wholeſome Laws that are every way ſuited and adapted to the circumſtances of their People. And ſuch as will be likely to have the greateſt Influence upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By taking care that good and wholeſome Laws be duely and ſeaſonably executed.</hi> That ſo Bold and Daring Tranſgreſſors of the Laws may be brought to due and condign puniſhment, that not only, they may be afraid to go on in ways of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Diſhoneſty, but others alſo, hearing what they have brought upon themſelves by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, may be deterred from doing as they have done. Deut. 13.10, 11. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſtone him with ſtones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And all Iſrael ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

will beware: as Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> obſerves. Magiſtrates have a Sword put into their hands to make Men afraid to do wickedly and diſhoneſtly, and they ſhould puniſh ſin without either fear or favour</p>

                  </gap>y countenancing and encouraging the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Godly</hi> In this way, they may not only ſtrengthen the hands of the godly, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to promote godlineſs in others alſo; but this will tend to encourage others to become like thoſe who are thus countenanced by the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. And hence, we ſee what was the reſolution of King <hi>David,</hi> in Pſal. 101.6. <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect way ſhall ſerve me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>By their good Examples.</hi> Examples are very leading &amp; prevailing, and in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Examples of Great Men, and thoſe that have Authority over others. The Examples of ſuch Men do powerfully incline others whether to Good or Bad: To Sin or Holineſs. If ſuch Men are <hi>Unchast, Unjuſt</hi> or <hi>Intemperate,</hi> &amp;c. their Examples are awfully Influential. How often is there that Bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d ſet upon King <hi>Jeroboam; He ſinned, and made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> When he indulged himſelf in ſin, this encouraged Multitudes of others to do wickedly. And it is obſerved, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.16 That their <hi>Leaders made them to err.</hi> There is a kind of ſovereignty in great Ones over Mens Lives &amp; Actions. And hence, <hi>Lanctantius</hi> notes, That Men account it, <hi>Obſequii quoddam ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Regis vit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

leſt their contrary vertues might ſeem to upbraid their Rulers Vices. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> (it is ſaid) accounted it graceful &amp; their duty to halt on that Leg on which their King limped. And the wiſe Man ſays, in Prov. 29.12. <hi>If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his ſervants are wicked.</hi> But if Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates go before others in a holy Life, and ſet them bright Examples of honeſty, Sobriety, Temperance &amp; Piety, this will provoke Piety in others. When Religion ſhines with the Rays of Greatneſs and Majeſty, this makes it glorious and lovely in the eyes of others, (as one expreſſes it.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>By taking care that the Goſpel be duely Preached unto their People.</hi> The Goſpel is called the Goſpel of Peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.15. As it is a means to promote and make up a Peace between GOD and ſinful Men, and ſettle Peace in the Souls of Men, and promotes love and peace among Men. And this is that whereby vital Piety is promoted: for it is a means of turning and changing the Hearts of Sinners. Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.</hi> And of building them up in faith and holineſs. Act. 20.32. <hi>I commend you to God and the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</hi> And the word of GOD where it converts not, it often civilizeth, and lays a reſtraint and curb upon Mens Spirits. It takes cognizance of, and cenſures and reproves thoſe inward lurking ſins, which the Civil Sword cannot reach. And therefore Civil Rulers may do much to promote Peace and Godlineſs, and Honeſty, by taking care that ſuitable Perſons be

And by taking care that they be encouraged in their work, and ſupported, that they may not be neceſſitated to leave that which is their proper Work, to provide for themſelves and families, and ſo to do their work negligently. <hi>Famem Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtorum ſequitur fames verbi,</hi> was a Prophecy of <hi>Luther</hi> long ago. That famiſhing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters would uſher in a famine of the word.

And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Princes caſt <hi>Jeremiah</hi> into a Dungeon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37.15. yet good King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſent Princes to teach in the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> as it is expreſſed in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.9. <hi>i. e.</hi> to provide for and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the <hi>Levites,</hi> who were ſent to teach. And good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhewed his remarkable zeal, that the People might not want the Service of GOD, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.2 and in <hi>v.</hi> 4. He orders the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Prieſts &amp; Levites, that they might neither want Subſiſtence, nor Encouragement. It was that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the ſtudy of it, and in doing their duty, according to it. He would have them be not only maintained but encouraged, that they might do their work with chearfulneſs: He was not for having them maintained in Idleneſs and Luxury; but in the Law of the Lord: In their obſerving of it themſelves, and teaching others the good knowledge of it.

Now they are ſet up and appointed to promote the beſt good of the People over whom they are ſet. The People are not made for them: but they for the good of the People; and therefore they ſhould ſay, with him, <hi>Non mihi, ſed Populo,</hi> and act with a greater concern to promote the Publick good of their People, than to promote their own private Intereſt: And particularly, They are ordained to promote the good of their People in <hi>this way,</hi> even by ſuppreſſing of Vice and Wickedneſs, and promoting Peace and Godlineſs, and Honeſty among them. Rom. 13.4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to thee for good— A Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.14. <hi>Governours are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002841_0023_0FE674FFC2954CF8"/>
And therefore if Rulers neglect to do this, or do not, to the uttermoſt of their power promote Piety and Honeſty among their People, they do fruſtrate the End for which they are made; not only as they are Men; but alſo fruſtrate the great and holy End, and deſign of GOD in ſetting them up in the Places which they are ſet in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Honour which GOD hath advanced them unto, brings them under very great Obligations to advance the Honour and Glory of GOD, as much as they can.</hi> They are very honourable Places that Rulers are ſet in, and it is GOD that hath advanced them unto them. Pſal. 75.6, 7.—<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth. But God is the Judge, He putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> And as He hath advanced them to honour, ſo He requires &amp; obligeth Men to reſpect &amp; reverence, and honour them. 1 Pet. 2.17. — <hi>Honour the King.</hi> Rom. 13.7. <hi>Render to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</hi> And as GOD will honour thoſe that honour him, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30.) ſo all thoſe who are honoured by GOD, are under ſpecial and peculiar obligations to improve all that they have in honouring of GOD. And ſeeing GOD is greatly honoured when Peace &amp; Piety and Honeſty are promoted among a People; and Rulers have great Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and Advantages to promote theſe, they ought to do it.

For (as an excellent Divine obſerves) There is nothing more certain than this, That the moſt ſerious, godly Chriſtians, are the beſt Subjects upon earth. It is therefore the Intereſt of Rulers to do all that poſſibly they can to promote Peace, and Godlineſs, and Honeſty among their People.</p>

of ſuch a conſideration, who ſays, in Pſal. 82.1. <hi>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty, he judgeth among the Gods.</hi> He ſtandeth as a Judge diligently to obſerve all that is done there. And this was what King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> made uſe of to excite the Judges which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in courſe of Juſtice, to faithfulneſs in their work, to lay out themſelves to promote Juſtice and Equity, and the Fear of the Lord: 2 Chron. 19.6. <hi>Ye judge not for man; but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment.</hi> When Judges are ſitting in Courts of Judicature, GOD is with them to obſerve, and take notice, Whether they impartially do Juſtice to every one, according to the beſt underſtanding that they can have of things. And when Rulers do meet together in a more general Aſſembly to tranſact and manage the Publick Affairs, GOD ſtands in that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Mighty, He Judges among them. He obſerves and takes notice of every One, and ſees what Principles and Motives they act from, as well as what they do, and what they deſign and aim at.

And how terrible and amazing will the Day of Judgment be unto them? If the thoughts of that Day, at a diſtance, made <hi>Felix</hi> to quake and tremble, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. How will they tremble, when they ſee it is come in good earneſt!

You ſee how it was with good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> what he was under, on apprehenſion that he ſhould die preſently: 2 King. 20.1, 2, 3. <hi>In thoſe days was Hezekiah ſick unto death, and the Prophet Iſaiah the ſon of Amos came unto him, and ſaid to him; thus ſaith the Lord, Set thine houſe in order; for thou ſhalt die, and not live. Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, ſaying, I beſeech thee, O Lord, Remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> And Oh, how reviving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing will the Great Day of the LORD be unto them, when it will be ſaid, Come ye bleſſed of my Father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you!

            </p>
            <p>Here it might be ſhewed,</p>
            <p>That when Civil Rulers are Inſtrumental to promote Peace &amp; Godlineſs, and Honeſty amongſt a People, ſuch a People are greatly benefitted by them. Very great is the good and advantage which a People receive by ſuch Rulers; and well may they be called Pillars &amp; Shields, and ſtrong Foundations, and the Breath of their Noſtrils, as they ſometimes are.

            <p>It is GOD that makes them to be what they are. As He ſets them in thoſe Places wherein they are ſo ſerviceable &amp; beneficial to their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ſo all their Gifts &amp; Qualifications are from GOD: It is He that hath qualified them for theſe Places, and ſpirited them to improve their Gifts and Parts, their Opportunities and Advantages for the good and benefit of their People.</p>

Thanks unto his holy Name, with affected and enlarged hearts, and to walk in ſome meaſure agreeable there-unto.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall now proceed to the Improvement, and apply what hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>USE 1 <hi>Hence we ſee what cauſe of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deep &amp; bitter Lamentation there is, That there is ſo much Impiety &amp; Diſhoneſty prevailing in this Land.</hi> We are fallen into great Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and ſore Declenſions, have loſt much of the Life &amp; Power of Godlineſs; and the Form of it ſeems to be going too; and tho' GOD hath been calling aloud to us by his Judgments to Repent, and Reform, yet we go on ſtill in our Treſpaſſes, and after all that GOD hath done to reclaim us, What ſinful &amp; ſcandalous Contentions have there been, which make way for Confuſion, and every evil Work: And how notorious does Pride and Idleneſs, Oppreſſion, Sabbath breaking, prophane Curſing &amp; Swearing, Drunkenneſs &amp; Uncleanneſs, and many more Abominations abound and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail amongſt us! And how are we ripening a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace hereby for more terrible &amp; amazing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Calamities! This is for a Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhould be for a Lamentation.</p>
            <p>USE 2. <hi>Hence ſee what ground &amp; occaſion there is of Joy &amp; Rejoycing that there are any among us, who have a zealous concern to promote Peace and Godlineſs, and Honeſty among this People.</hi> Altho' we are grown very Degenerate &amp; Corrupt, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002841_0031_0FE675073050D1F8"/>
Iniquity does abound exceedingly amongſt us; yet it muſt be acknowledged to the glory of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace &amp; Mercy, that there is a Number of ſerious godly, praying Ones among us, who weep and mourn Day and Night for the Iniquities and Abominations, that are in the midſt of us; and are zealouſly concerned for the revival of the work of the LORD, and the promoting of Peace, and Godlineſs, and Honeſty. Theſe are the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of our Iſrael, and the Horſemen thereof.</p>
            <p>And it is to be looked upon as a Token for good, that ſo many are ſpirited to lay out part of their Eſtates, to give their hopeful Sons a liberal Education; and that ſo many of thoſe who are ſo Educated, are Spirited to give up themſelves to the work of the Miniſtry, when the Miniſtry is under ſuch dark &amp; diſcouraging circumſtances, that they cannot have any proſpect of advancing their worldly Intereſt by engaging in that work. It looks as if they were acted by a more noble and generous principle; that it is a deſire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental of promoting Religion &amp; Godlineſs, that carries them out to undertake ſo good a work; May the GOD of all Grace be with them, and fill them more abundantly with his Spirit &amp; Grace, that when the Aged Servants of the Lord, and thoſe who are in our declining Years ſhall be called off from our work, we may leave it with a joyful proſpect of this, that our Places are like to be filled up with thoſe who will do more to promote true Godlineſs, than ever we have done.</p>

without the Addition of Humane Inventions: Eſpecially conſidering with what Hazard and Expences our Fathers tranſported themſelves and their Families over the vaſt Ocean into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and what Difficulties they waded thro', that they might enjoy pure Ordinances them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is the work which we are ſeparated and ſet apart unto, and very awfully and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Charged to do, <hi>viz</hi> to promote Peace and Godlineſs, and Honeſty among our People; and ſeeing it is ſo deſirable a thing for a People to lead ſuch lives, and will conduce ſo much to the Glory of GOD, and the good of his People, how ſhould we labour and ſpend ourſelves to promote them not only by Praying for our Civil Rulers, and encouraging them to go on ſteddily and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly with their work; but alſo by applying our ſelves to that which is our proper work. That if poſſible in this Day of Degeneracy the work of the Lord may be revived, and many may have their eyes opened, and be turned from darkneſs
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002841_0037_0FE6750EAB95BED0"/>
to light, and from the Power of Sin and Satan unto GOD; that Bold and daring Sinners may turn their Feet into the way of GOD's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and the Profeſſors of Religion may be ſound in GOD's Statutes, and ſtedfaſt in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and adorn the Doctrine of GOD their Saviour in all things; and the things which are ready to die may be ſtrengthned. And to that End, labour in the moſt lively and affecting man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to ſet forth unto them their Miſery by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the vileneſs of Sin, the Vanity of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Excellency of CHRIST. And with the greateſt Importunity cry to the GOD of all Grace, for the plentiful effuſion of his Spirit and Grace, that it may be a Day of his Power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in very many may be made willing to come over to CHRIST, and walk in his ways, and uphold Religion in the Life &amp; Power of it. And dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and faithfully attend upon every part of our work, depending upon GOD for Aſſiſtance therein, and Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Indeed, many are labouring under ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that they cannot give themſelves to this work, as they ſhould do, and would do. Altho' they are wronged and injured; yet, People who are quick ſighted in other Caſes will not ſee it, and therefore they are not relieved; yet let all, as far as poſſibly they can, improve their Time, and all their Talents to promote Peace and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, depending upon GOD, not only for Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and Succeſs; but for a Maintenance, who is able to open the Eyes and Hearts of People. It is a Good GOD that we ſerve, and he will not
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002841_0038_0FE674EEAE98CD70"/>
fail any that Truſt in him. He hath a glorious Reward for all that will ſerve him faithfully.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Theſe Truths may be improved in a loud Call to the Body of this People.</hi> You hear how much our living in Peace, and in the Practice of Godlineſs and Honeſty would tend to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD. And how much it would be for our own Honour and Safety. O, that you would all do what you poſſibly can for the promoting of it, and that not only by praying for, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring and ſupporting our Rulers, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and teſtifying againſt Bold Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and by encouraging the hearts, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the hands of your Miniſters: but alſo by labouring to uphold and maintain the life and power of Godlineſs in your own Souls, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it as much as you can in your Families.</p>
            <p>And ſo all Heads of Families are to be called upon, to endeavour the Revival of Family Religion and Family Government. There is nothing more neceſſary than this at this Day. For, as one well obſerves, If a People have the beſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and they Enact the beſt Laws, and back them with the ſtricteſt Execution; yet So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties will be naught, if Heads of Families neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their Duty. They have the Care of Perſons in their young and tender Years, when they may be bowed; but if they neglect them till they grow up, they are like to be unmanageable; and ſo to be plagues to the Places where they dwell. It is very probable that at this Door, that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy and Degeneracy came in which hath aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully crept upon this People, and hath been
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002841_0039_0FE6750ED8CAEC80"/>
teſtified againſt, by ſo many amazing Judgments and Calamities. And if ever this People become a truly reformed People there muſt be a Revival of Family Religion, Family Inſtruction and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Government. I ſhall therefore Conclude with a Call to all Heads of Families, to walk within their Houſes with a perfect Heart. Set up and maintain the Worſhip of GOD in your Families conſtantly. Take pains in teaching and inſtructing all that are under your Care, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern your Families well.</p>
            <p>And if All ſorts of Perſons would unite their active and zealous Endeavours, with Prudence and Fidelity, to ſuppreſs Sin and Wickedneſs and promote the contrary, we ſhould ſoon come to live in Peace, and in the due Exerciſe &amp; Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all true Godlineſs and Honeſty. And then ſhould we proſper in all our Undertakings, and ſee Good according to the Years wherein we have ſeen Evil; Glory alſo would dwell in our Land. And we ſhould have occaſion to raiſe that note of Triumph, <hi>The Lord of HOST is with us, The GOD of Jacob is our Refuge,</hi> Selah.</p>
