            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THAT there is a certain and moſt exact Providence of God, over all the Affairs of Man-kind in this World, from the higheſt unto the meaneſt and moſt minute, inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, and all the circumſtances of them; is a truth ſo great, ſo plain and obvious, that it is agreed upon both in Reaſon and Religion; as may be gathered from the Apoſtles quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Act. 17. 28. <hi>For in him we live and move and have our being</hi>—: It is true alſo that the Myſteries of Common, but eſpecially of ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, are ſo great, ſo deep, ſo wonderful and ſometimes ſo amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that men are fain to ſtand ſtill, and ſay as in <hi>Job</hi> 11. 8. <hi>It is as high as heaven, what canſt thou do? deeper then hell, what canſt thou know?</hi> And 'tis at no time more ſo than in the way of God's Judgments, and moſt of all when his own People are the Subjects of thoſe Judgments; then oft times there is occaſion to Repeat and Ruminate upon that Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>How unſearchable are his Judgments and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi> But, be the Premiſes of this kind what they will, we muſt alway obſtinately hold faſt that ſure Concluſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 6. <hi>Thy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is like the great mountains; thy Judgments are a great deep:</hi> or elſe we ſhall make Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience in theſe great deeps. And in this Chapter wherein our Text is; We may obſerve the method and pains which <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the Godly <hi>Jews</hi> with him, take for the clearing up, and eſtabliſhing of this Concluſion, as 'tis laid down in our Text.

and troubleſome Juncture, much of their Comfort and Reſt from the Lord, was conveyed unto them by his inſtrumentality: he was the Inſtrument of procuring for, and ſettling among them, the revival of their former precious and pleaſant things in a great degree, after the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity.</p>

            <p>In Proſecution of which in this Nineth Chapter, he and they do ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and publickly take notice of the Scheme of Gods wayes unto that People, and their wayes unto him; and do Alternately touch upon ſome of the main points of both, from their beginning unto that time: Until at length in this 33. <hi>v.</hi> the words of our Text, they come unto and fix upon, a very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſolemn Vindication of the Name of God; by aſſerting his Juſtice in all his Judicial proceedings againſt and dealings with them, together with a cloſe Animadverſion upon themſelves.</p>

1. A Juſtification of God, with reſpect unto his Judgments inflicted upon his own and only People, the People of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And this argued from his Works, and in particular from his Works of Judgment, which they had been the Subjects of. <hi>Howbeit thou art Juſt in all that is brought upon us; for thou haſt done right: q. d.</hi> Be the Caſe how it will with us, and indeed it is bad enough, ſad enough, and dreadful enough, as to things paſt and preſent, and diſmal preſages there are for the future; yet we muſt and do, freely and openly Juſtify the Lord our God, in and under all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A Condemnation of themſelves; with reſpect unto their own Sins; their Condemnation is argued from their Works, and their Works of Iniquity.—<hi>But we have done wickedly;</hi> it is in plain, full, downright termes, without any extenuation, or mincing the matter. So that the Doctrine which reſults from hence is this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That although the Judgments which God brings upon his own Sinning People, are very many, and exceeding great; yet He is moſt Juſt in all of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They do in our Text make a plump and full acknowledgment of this Truth: when the Caſe between God and themſelves comes to be conſidered, they do before the whole World, Heaven and Earth, give in clear and full evidence to this Truth, however it does reflect upon themſelves; that God is moſt Juſt in all his Judgments upon them; and by parity of reaſon, the like teſtimony muſt be given for him, with reſpect to his proceedings againſt any other ſuch people of his own, whom he ſhall viſit with his Judgments as he did them: And indeed this is a ruled and ſettled Caſe: The Prophet is expreſs and ample in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation hereto. Dan. 9. 14.—<hi>For the Lord our God is Righteous, (or Juſt) in all his Works; i. e.</hi> in his works of Judgment upon his own People; for theſe are the works which the ſcope of the Text is directed unto. Alſo that is very pertinent and pregnant for the Confirmation of this Truth which is given in and recorded, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 18.—<hi>O Lord God of Iſrael thou art Righteous.</hi> Speaking of his Judgments which had overtaken, and taken hold of that Sinning People of the Lord. This Doctrine conſiſts of four ſingle Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>PROPOSITION <hi>I. That God's own People may be a very Sinful People.</hi> This People of the <hi>Jews</hi> were God's own and only People; they were ſo by common Eſtimation, by Profeſſion, and by ſolemn Covenant-Tranſaction, they had Avouched the Lord for their God, and God had Avouched them for his People; and yet they were a very Sinful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: So it may be with any other People of God in this World: they may be ſo really, not rightfully; there's no allowance for them to be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001193_0006_0FB0FEB531E2A910"/>
ſo, but there's certain experience that they are ſo. It was obſerved by the Wiſe man of old, <hi>That there's not a Juſt man upon the Earth that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not:</hi> And this is a very forcible way of proving this Poſition which he had then undertaken the demonſtration of. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 46. There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Sins of Infirmity in the beſt perſons, and in the beſt people in this World; but they are Sins of Enormity and groſs Iniquity which are here ſpoken of: for they muſt be ſuch, to bring a People of God under the juſt denomination of a Sinful People; and they are truly &amp; properly a Sinful People, when they are a Degenerate People, fallen off from God, from what they profeſs and pretend to be; ſometimes have been or by Covenant are bound to be; <hi>When they are turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange Vine unto God,</hi> Jer. 2. 21. When they have loſt their piety towards God, their equity, honeſty, charity and morality towards men; and the contrary, impiety, prophanity, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality and vitioſity take place inſtead thereof; and this becomes their common and epidemical caſe: As 'tis ſaid to be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>The whole head is ſick, and the whole heart is faint;</hi> and they make a trade of Sin, and are accuſtomed unto Sin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. they commit Sin as if it were their buſineſs, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>Ye have plowed wickedneſs.</hi> When 'tis ſo with a People of God, they are then a very ſinful people: And that God's own People may become ſuch is evident, not only from what the Holy Scriptures tell us others have been, but from what experience tells us we our ſelves are. A lively and graphical Exemplification of this aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful truth, we have this day in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>That manifold and dreadful Judgments are the Proper, and will be the certain portion of God's People when they are become a very Sinful People.</hi> If God's People become a depraved, deformed, degenerate ſinful people, they muſt fall under the Severities of God's Judgments. <hi>Judgment muſt begin at the Houſe of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 17. and they are ſevere Judgments, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 19, 20. <hi>Do they provoke me to anger, faith the Lord? do they not provoke themſelves to the confuſion of their own faces? Therefore thus faith the Lord God, Behold mine anger and my fury ſhall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beaſt, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground, and it ſhall burn, and ſhall not be quenched.</hi> Theſe Judgments of God, are all thoſe penal evils which are inflicted by God in a way of judicial proceeding; and whatever others do, God's own Sinning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beſure ſhall not eſcape; <hi>Ames</hi> 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth: therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> And there is an unparallel'd Severity in the Judgments of God upon his own Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning People; there is no Severity in this World like it, unleſs it be that of the <hi>Sword of the Lord againſt the Man that is his fellow:</hi> thus much is

This might be made illuſtriouſly evident, by a particular conſideration of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were inflicted upon the Jews in their Captivity; they were all of them the Lords Judgment, as to kind, time, degree, inſtruments, extent, duration, iſſue, effects and conſequents thereof; this is fully tho' briefly expreſſed and aſſerted, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 12, 13. <hi>Therefore thus faith the Lord God of Iſrael, Behold, I am bringing ſuch evil upon Jeruſalem &amp; Judah, that whoſoever heareth of it, both his ears ſhall tingle. And I will ſtretch over Jeruſalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the houſe of Ahab: and I will wipe Jeruſalem, as a man wipeth a diſh, wiping it, and turning it upſide down.</hi>

            <p>PROP. IV. <hi>That God is moſt juſt in all theſe Judgments of His.</hi> Tho' they are upon his own People, and are very many, and very great, yet God is moſt juſt or righteous in all of them: He is truly and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatively juſt, or which is the ſame thing, Righteous in them all; in appointing and inflicting, ordering, continuing and iſſuing them, in all the parts, articles, circumſtances and punctilio's of them, from firſt to laſt, from beginning to end; He is abſolutely, perfectly, inviolably and infinitely juſt and righteous.

this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 6. <hi>The heavens ſhall declare his righteouſneſs.</hi> The Angels proclaim his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 5. He is fixed unchangeable and immoveable, as a Rock in regard of his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4. <hi>He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he.</hi> He is univerſally and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 14.—<hi>Juſtice and Judgment are the Habitation of thy Throne.</hi> This is a ſure uncontroulable concluſion, tho' men can't al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſee how to draw it out of the premiſes. This made the holy Prophet ſay, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy Judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the Wicked proſper? Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherouſly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Juſtice of God it is not his Eſſential but his Relative Juſtice; whereby he gives unto all his Creatures that which does belong unto them. For as he is juſt in himſelf, in his own Nature, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 21.—<hi>A juſt God.</hi>—Altogether juſt, and moſt juſt, even Juſtice it ſelf; ſo he is juſt in all his works and doings to his Creatures, and therefore in his Works of Judgments to his People: He renders to them thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which do of right belong unto them, according to a Rule of Juſtice; and the Rule of Relative Juſtice, it is the Will of God. God originally owes nothing to his Creatures, therefore that only is their due which he Willeth unto them, that Will of his therefore is the Rule of moral Juſtice. The Will of purpoſe it is the Secret and Everlaſting Rule of this Juſtice; His Will of Precept 'tis the Written Rule of this Juſtice: And his Law conſidered as a Covenant, as 'tis under the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Promiſes and Threatnings, is the Rule according to which his own People may expect he will diſpenſe Juſtice unto them, in the way of his Judgments. Againſt this Rule there is no exception to be made by us; no not againſt his Judgment of eternal Condemnation upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate who periſh, being Reprobated according to the Will of God; for their eternal Reprobation, and ſo their Condemnation it is according to this righteous Rule of Juſtice between God and man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the bleſſed Apoſtle does with a diſdainful deteſtation reject the very thoughts of impeaching the Juſtice of God, in the Reprobation of them that are according to Scripture Phraſe, <hi>hated of God;</hi> as it is Written, <hi>Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated. What ſhall we ſay then? Is there unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God? God forbid.</hi> The Argument to prove it follows: <hi>For he faith to Moſes, I will have mercy on whom I will have Mercy, and I will have Compaſſion on whom I will have Compaſſion,</hi> Rom. 9. 13, 14, 15. And it is added to cloſe all,—<hi>and whom he will he hardneth,</hi> 18. v. However impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unreaſonably, and in defiance of the whole Scope of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, ſome would underſtand the Apoſtle of Temporal Judgments of this Life, thereby to Enervate the Decree of Reprobation. And if
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001193_0009_0FB0FEBA6F00D258"/>
this Judgment of God be ſo uncontrolably Juſt, becauſe it is according to, and the product of his Will; much more may we, and <hi>muſt</hi> we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that all thoſe Judgments ſpoken of in our Text and Doctrine; even the Judgments of God upon his own People, are moſt Juſt: for they are the accompliſhment of his Decree, which is altogether Juſt; The Execution of his Law which is moſt holy, juſt and good: And the fulfilling of his Covenant in the juſt threatnings thereof, which are put thereinto; <hi>if his Children forſake my Law, and walk not in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if they break my ſtatutes and keep not my Commandments: Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſions with the Rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes:</hi> And theſe are the Judgments of God upon his own People, in which He is moſt juſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE I.</hi> Hence we may infer, that there is an abſolute neceſſity of the Atonement of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to make Peace with God for us. When the Juſtice of God is offended and provoked to proceed in a way of Vengeance, which is the work of provoked Juſtice, inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgment upon the Sinner, there's nothing to be juſtly expected, but the juſt ruin and utter confuſion of thoſe, who by their Sins have drawn it forth, unleſs there be an Atonement made: So God ſpeaks. <hi>A fire is kindled in mine anger, and ſhall burn unto the loweſt hell, and ſhall conſume the earth with her increaſe, and ſet on fire the foundations of the mountains. I will heap miſchiefs upon them, I will ſpend mine arrows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. They ſhall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter deſtruction:</hi> Deut. 32, 22, 23, 24. And this Vengeance will not be recalled, unleſs the Anger of God ceaſe; and this Anger will not ceaſe, unleſs provoked Juſtice be atoned; and Juſtice will be atoned only by the Satisfaction and Interceſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If there be no Satisfaction, &amp; ſo no atonement made, the Juſtice of God will take ſatisfaction by diſtraint upon the Sinner, which way of ſatisfaction we are fore-warned to take heed of. <hi>When thou goeſt with thine adverſary to the Magiſtrate: as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayſt be delivered from him, leſt he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer caſt thee into priſon. I tell thee, thou ſhalt not depart thence, till thou haſt paid the very laſt mite.</hi> Luk. 12. 58, 59. There's a way of reconciliation made known in the Goſpel by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf,</hi>—2 Cor. 5. 19. And as this is the way of atonement for perſons, ſo it is for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alſo. God of old directed his people to this way. <hi>Gather your ſelves together, O Nation not deſired: before the decree bring forth:</hi>—<hi>Seek ye the Lord.</hi>—<hi>Seek righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Zeph. 2. 1, 2, 3. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the only hiding place for a people from the Storms of God's Anger.<hi>

               <hi>USE II. EXHORTATION.</hi> And 'tis twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us be Exhorted to lament and amend our own Sins, Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Injuſtice before and towards God. God is truly and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatively juſt and righteous, without any manner of unrighteouſneſs; and this upon the utmoſt trial and experiment that can be made of him. We muſt ſay, <hi>There's no unrighteouſneſs in him, Pſal.</hi> 92. 15. But there is unrighteouſneſs and injuſtice in us; we have done <hi>wickedly.</hi> Righteouſneſs in God 'tis his Nature and Eſſence; in man, Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is his nature. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. And Righteouſneſs 'tis of Grace, and 'tis the Image of God in him, and his acceptableneſs unto God: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs 'tis the Image of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and diſpleaſing and contrary unto God; and for this God is diſpleaſed with us. The Servants and Meſſengers of God in this place, upon like Occaſions, have with one mouth faithfully born witneſs againſt our Sins and Unrighteouſneſſes; and if men ſhould be ſilent, theſe <hi>Walls</hi> and theſe <hi>Pillars</hi> would teſtify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, that we have been Convicted for offending againſt the Rules, both of Commutative and Diſtributive Juſtice: <hi>We have not given unto God the Glory due to his Name,</hi> to his Nature, to our own Bonds and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to him; nor have we rendred unto him according to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, means, priviledges and Bleſſings beſtowed upon us. <hi>Hezekiah'</hi>s Sin has been too common among us. We han't Glorifyed God as God, nor been thankful: this is to be lamented and amended; and we ſhould labour to deal truly herein, and not flatter and lye as they did,<hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001193_0017_0FB0FEC7AF4F2138"/>
Pſal.</hi> 78. 36, 37. And if we do ſo, <hi>God will be merciful to our Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he will remember our Sins no more,</hi> Heb. 8. 12. If otherwiſe, the Caſe is determined, the Written doom will come;—<hi>The Lord knows to reſerve the Unjuſt unto the day of Judgment to be puniſhed,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us be Exhorted, to dread and avoid the further provoking the Juſtice of the Juſt and Righteous God againſt us. For God is a <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> God ſtill; and he is in the way of his Judgments: <hi>His Hand is ſtretched out ſtill;</hi> and may be provoked unto ſtill greater degrees of Juſt diſpleaſure againſt us. <hi>He is an Holy and Jealous God,</hi> Joſh. 24. 19, 20. <hi>A terrible God:</hi>—Neh. 1. 5. None can be ſo fooliſh and Atheiſtical as to think, that God has ſent all his Judgments, and ſpent all his Arrows upon us. The Anger of God yet to come, is as heavy and dreadful as we can fear it to be: <hi>According to thy fear ſo is thy wrath,</hi> Pſal. 90. 11. Taking the fear of God objectively, it refers unto that Article of the Hiſtory of <hi>Iſraels</hi> travels in the Wilderneſs, which we have in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. Where when the People had Committed that great and critical Sin of refuſing to enter into the Land; and <hi>Moſes</hi> told them how ill God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their evil carriage, they had awful and dreadful apprehenſions of the Anger of God; and he tells them <hi>it was every way as great as they could conceive of.</hi> Therefore let us all in general take heed of irritating and exaſperating this Juſt Anger, or this injured and provoked Juſtice of God againſt us; Why ſhould we provoke him, <hi>Are we ſtronger than He?</hi> And therefore in General,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us look to our <hi>Religion.</hi> This is mans glorifying of God and enjoying of him, <hi>and as it is the chief end of man;</hi> ſo this was the main &amp; principal end of our Fore-fathers, thoſe men of <hi>Renown,</hi> who firſt ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth theſe Heavens, &amp; laid the foundations of this Earth; Setled a Chriſtian Religious State and Churches in this Country. And they have Committed their work and enterprize to us, and left us to parſue and proſecute the ſame to effect: and whatever we do without this we do but trifle and <hi>Serio nihil Agere;</hi> and deſerve to be reproved for our neglect of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 41. If our <hi>Religion</hi> be neglected or perverted, Gods offended Juſtice will be further provoked and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and we ſhall be more expoſed. <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower whereunto the Righteous flee and are ſafe,</hi> as <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 10. Our <hi>Religion</hi> is our greateſt and beſt <hi>bulwark:</hi> If this be neglected our defence departs from us, and we ſhall be as bread to our enemies, as they ſaid, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 9. If we loſe our <hi>Religion</hi> we loſe <hi>All;</hi> and if we are cheated of our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> we are cheated of <hi>All:</hi> for, according to the word of our Lord CHRIST, <hi>All came with our Religion: Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added.</hi> And according to the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001193_0018_0FB0FECA5B8AF2F8"/>
Word of God, all will go with our <hi>Religion. Noſ.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Therefore will I return and take my Corn in the time thereof.</hi> Look well to Religion and we look well to All; Look well to the Soundneſs and Purity of Religion, in Heart, and Life, in Doctrine, and Practice, in Worſhip and Diſcipline; or Chriſt will ſay as to <hi>Sardis,</hi>—<hi>I have not found thy ways perfect before God, Rev.</hi> 3. 2. Look well to the Love of our Religion, that ſo we be not given up to ſtrong deluſions, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11.—<hi>Becauſe they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Love of the truth, that they might be Saved: for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a Lye:</hi> Even the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Lye. Look well to the Life and Power of Religion; or Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt will nauſeate and ſpue us out of his mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>So then becauſe thou art Luke-warm and neither hot not cold, I will ſpue thee out of my mouth.</hi> Look at thoſe as the worſt Sins, that Hurt our Religion moſt; as impenitence, unbelief, error, hereſy, ſuperſtition, hypocriſy, forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and all manner of Apoſtacy. And look at thoſe as our pooreſt friends, that are not friends to our Religion; and thoſe as our worſt Enemies who are Enemies to our Religion, who ſtrike at and hurt our Religion; the caſe between ſuch and us is much as it was ſometimes between the <hi>Syrian King,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 31. Our Religion it is our Life,—And as he ſaid, ſo may we, <hi>Set your hearts to all the words which I teſtify to you this day,</hi>—<hi>for it is not a vain thing for you, for it is your life, Deut.</hi> 32. 46. They that would take away our Religion would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our Lives: they would commit the worſt Murder upon us. What that great Reformer <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid of the Doctrine of Juſtification; it is <hi>Articulus ſtantis et Cadentis Eccleſiae;</hi> may we much more ſay of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is, <hi>Articulus ſtantis et Cadentis Populi.</hi> If you dont look well to your Religion, Jeſus Chriſt will ſay as to them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 34, 35. <hi>Your Houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us Labour to acquit our ſelves well with reſpect unto <hi>Civil Government.</hi> Government it is Gods Ordinance: therefore as we ſhould <hi>Fear God,</hi> ſo ſhould we <hi>Honour the King,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 17. <hi>And the Powers that are among us, they are of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. It is a great mercy of God to us, all our difficulties &amp; uneaſineſſes which we labour under notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: our Government is a great Mercy of God to us, and that which we ought to be truly thankful to him for. If it ſhould degenerate into <hi>Tyranny, Anarchy,</hi> or ſuch hardſhips as we hear ſome others groan under, we ſhould ſoon find the difference. Therefore let us labour to acquit our ſelves well, and approve our ſelves as good Chriſtians: as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Exerciſe our ſelves herein to have a Conſcience void of offence towards God and towards man,</hi> Act. 16. 24.

And we ſhould uphold and ſupport Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that it may not decay, languiſh and ſink; it's true, 'tis not a time for us <hi>to ſeek great things to our ſelves,</hi> God faith, <hi>ſeek them not,</hi> Jer. 45. 5. But we muſt endeavour that our Government be not mean, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and contemptible. Thus in general.</p>
            <p>More particularly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> Let this Exhortation be Preſented and Recommended unto thoſe among us who are betruſted with the <hi>Civil Government.</hi> The betruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Government, whether it be the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> or the <hi>Executive</hi> part of it, or both, is great; God and his people have committed much unto You, and repoſed great Aſſurances in You: Therefore to You the Exhortation is, that You would conſider and dread, and avoid any other further provoking the offended Juſtice of God againſt us. And SIR, Let this Counſel be acceptable to Your EXCELLENCY, to the Honourable COUNCIL, and to the worthy Gentlemen the REPRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTATIVES of the Province, to labour that the offended Juſtice of God, may neither by <hi>Omiſſion of Duty,</hi> nor by <hi>Commiſſion of Evil,</hi> nor by any means be any farther exaſperated and incenſed againſt us.

And if God be with You this day, we ſhall take it for a token for good to us for this Year alſo, and it is a great thing for the Barren Fig-tree to be ſpared one year. Therefore labour that the <hi>Election</hi> of this day may be ſo made and managed as may not further incenſe the already provoked Juſtice of God againſt us: Remember that Apoſtolical Precept. <hi>Let nothing be done thro' ſtrife or vain glory,</hi>—<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3.

            <p n="1">1. Conſider whether there ought not to be ſome ſtronger and ſtricter guard ſet upon God's <hi>Holy Sabbath,</hi> to prevent the Prophanation of it. Gods Holy Sabbath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lords Day is very dear unto God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; it is His Day and therefore is greater than any man's day whatſoever.

All the Sons of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhould be like the fine Gold, and this is like our firſt golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks; thus ſhould our people be brought back.</p>
            <p>In particular,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us labour to bring them back in regard of <hi>Principles,</hi> unto the firſt <hi>Principles of our Fathers</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> after that they were ſetled, and had cleared up things; ſo that they did clearly, diſtinctly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly declare their principles &amp; publiſh them; theſe principles owned and avowed by them, and skreened from thoſe miſinterpretations which ſome would reproach them with, ſhould we return unto: It's a ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that there has been ſo great, ſinful and very grievous bandy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beating about principles, That the Enemy, who loves to fiſh in troubled waters, has almoſt fiſhed away all, or at leaſt all our good and firſt principles from us: And left us a drift in an unſettled fluctuant poſture, to our ſhame and humiliation.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to principles, let me propound three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let our Principles be <hi>Scriptural.</hi> The Holy Scripture is that <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule which we ſhould meaſure the Sanctuary with, Rev.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40. 3. This is the true and only Standard of the Sanctuary; if this be not attended unto, all in the Sanctuary will be marred &amp; corrupted; <hi>Churches</hi> will be corrupted, <hi>Ordinances</hi> will be corrupted; and viſible Saints will be corrupted: <hi>Miniſters</hi> they will not be as Gods mouth, as they ought to be, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 19. They will not be able to keep the charge of the holy things of God, and then he will be diſpleaſed with them as He was, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 8, 9.—11. <hi>v.</hi> however they may be continued to be Miniſters ſtill. There are no other meaſures of men or Angels will quadrate with Gods Sanctuary, but only this Golden Rule. Miniſters muſt teach only what Jeſus Chriſt has commanded them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I command you.</hi>—And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001193_0024_0FB0FED4B6068548"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt are in the Holy Scriptures, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto Scriptural Principles ſhould we labour to bring them back.<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">2. Let our principles be <hi>Rational,</hi> thoſe that are not Rational, are not Scriptural: here it holds true, <hi>Si collidimur frangimur.</hi> Principles ſhould not be like Ropes of Sand, meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. Let Principles be as much as is poſſible according to the <hi>Good Old way.</hi> It's true, we ſhould not take principles on truſt, or the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men; becauſe that theſe or thoſe men were ſo opinionated: And it is as true, we ſhould not reject them upon truſt; not reject them, becauſe theſe and thoſe men diſlike of, and are prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. To leave old Principles proved and approved by the moſt Eminent Servants of God, and Societies of God's People, and by God himſelf, and take up with new ones in their ſtead, is no better than ſetting up of new Gods; <hi>Gods newly brought up, Deut.</hi> 32. 17. This was their ſin; and if we do ſo, it will be our ſin and ſhame: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us adhere, and bring back all to the good old Principles, which have been thus proved and approved; and walk in the way of good men, as the advice of Wiſdom, even of Jeſus Chriſt is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 20. And it was Chriſt's way to reduce things to what they were at the beginning, and ſo to regulate them, ſo in the caſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and ſo he directs them: <hi>Do the firſt works, Rev.</hi> 2. 5. And thoſe that do indeed know the good of the firſt, will adhere unto them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 39. <hi>No man having drunk old wine, ſtraightway deſireth new; for he ſaith the old is better.</hi> And thus we ſhould endeavour to bring back all to the firſt Principles of our Fathers, and ſo to their firſt Ways.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us endeavour not only to engage the <hi>Hearts</hi> of our People to us, but their <hi>Prayers</hi> for us It's a good thing for Miniſters to have the hearts of their People; the Word of the Goſpel is more like to have its free courſe, and run from the heart to the heart. But they ſhould alſo endeavour to have their Prayers, and this will engage and diſpoſe them to profit by them; this therefore is a moſt deſirable, pleaſant and precious thing: <hi>As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold; ſo is a wiſe reprover upon an obedient ear, Prov.</hi> 25. 12.</p>

The third branch of the <hi>EXHORTATION</hi> follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> The Exhortation ſpeaks to the People of <hi>All Sorts, Old</hi> and <hi>Young, High,</hi> and <hi>Low, Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor,</hi> in their ſeveral Stations; that they would very earneſtly endeavour and do their utmoſt, <hi>That the Juſtice of God may not be further provoked againſt us.</hi> God is angry with us; his Juſtice is offended; or elſe we muſt ſay as the Enemy of God and his People ſaith, <hi>That the Lord's Hand hath not done all this,</hi> Deut. 32. 27. For all that has come upon us is either from the Lord or it is ſome Chance that has happened unto us: Therefore let us not halt between two opinions. And if we do indeed acknowledge God; we have cauſe to ſay as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 120. <hi>My fleſh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> Therefore dont put more <hi>fuel</hi> into this devouring fire, nor oyl into this conſuming flame.</p>
            <p>Here are three things to be attended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of and avoid <hi>Goſpel</hi> Sins. Where the Goſpel comes there are the greateſt Sins in the World; ſuch Sins are more hainous than the Sins of <hi>Sodom, Matt.</hi> 11. 20—24. Goſpel neglecting, Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, and Goſpel deſpiſing; Impenitence, Unbelief, hardneſs of Heart; Ignorance of, unthankfulneſs for, and barrenneſs under Jeſus Chriſt in his Goſpel; loathing the Heavenly Manna; Lukewarmneſs, Hypocriſy, and taking up with a ſhew and appearance inſtead of ſubſtance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 18. And falling off from and forſaking Jeſus Chriſt for this preſent evil World: Theſe are Sins to be avoided, if we would not have God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked yet more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Walk before God in your <hi>Houſes</hi> in a perfect way. God has raiſed us up Families like Flocks, and filled our Land with People; Families are Societies which nature inſtitutes; and the <hi>Heads</hi> of them by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral right govern them; and <hi>Religious Heads</hi> ſhould govern them for God. We ſay, that We and our Families are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children are of the <hi>Faith of Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 9. And ſhould do the works of <hi>Abraham, Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 8. 39, 40. Now <hi>Abraham commanded his Houſe to Serve the Lord,</hi> Gen. 18. 19. If we would ſhine as lights in an evil Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: if we would be of another Spirit, than the World are of, we muſt do as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did: Reſolve every one, <hi>As for me and mine Houſe, We will Serve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24. 15. Mend Families and mend all, ruin Families and ruin all. It is a ſad Omen to Conſider how many of the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Families in this Country are utterly extinct or worſe: <hi>Fond Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> and <hi>Remiſneſs</hi> in Family Government deſtroys Families: it brings <hi>Belialiſm</hi> into our Land, which does diffuſe it ſelf abroad, and paſſeth like oyl into our bones. And if <hi>Eli's</hi> Sins be found among us, we muſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001193_0026_0FB0FED8C4248FE8"/>
expect <hi>Eli's</hi> Judgments, and have had a ſevere taſte of them already: our Children have been brought forth for the Murderer; they have been numbred from year to year theſe many years to the Sword, to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, to Captivity, to Sickneſs, to Shipwrack and to Death, by Scor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and by hundreds of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be much in <hi>Prayer.</hi> Prayer is the very breath and vital Air of a Child of God, 'tis their guiſe to be much in Prayer, they are Spirited for it. There's the Spirit of Adoption, even the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. And this Spirit helps them to Pray, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. And gives them boldneſs with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. Pray therefore for the <hi>Effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Spirit:</hi> Pray for the Kingdom and Glory of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Pray for the <hi>Churches</hi> that they may be kept <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Entire:</hi> Pray for the <hi>Children</hi> of the Lords People, that He would Circumciſe their Hearts to fear him, and that He would help his Servants aright, clearly to diſcern, and faithfully and ſucceſsfully to do their Duty to them; that they may not become a Generation of his Wrath: And this Prayer of Faith is the beſt way to prevent the encreaſe, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the flames which are kindled upon us round about, by which we have been ſet on Fire, and are ſtill burning: for this will engage the interceſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is the moſt precious and acceptable incenſe of Atonement, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>To enforce this whole <hi>APPLICATION,</hi> there are theſe four Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a moſt <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> thing that we ſhould do ſo. That we ſhould Seek <hi>Atonement</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt; and that we ſhould <hi>Juſtify</hi> God, in all the Evils and Judgments of God againſt us; and that we ſhould <hi>Lament</hi> and <hi>Amend</hi> our own Sins and Unrighteouſneſs before the Lord, and endeavour all to do our utmoſt that this <hi>Offended Juſtice</hi> of God may not be more provoked againſt us: Theſe are Juſt and Right things, ſuch as we owe to our own Souls, to one another, and alſo to the Lord our God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is the trueſt accepting of the puniſhment of our Sins; when God puniſhes Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> does inflict evil upon his People or Chaſtiſe them for their Sins: He expects they ſhould be humble under his hand; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt him, kiſs the Rod, and lye in the duſt, if there be hope, Lam.</hi> 3. 29.—31. And this is one of his great ends which God aims at, and 'tis acceptable to him to ſee it attained; therefore when he ſaw it in <hi>Ephraim, his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els were moved for him, Jer.</hi> 31. 18. And if this end be attained upon us, his bowels will yet be moved for <hi>New-England,</hi> and his repentings will be enkindled together. Of old time God has encouraged his People, that in this way they ſhould hope for his gracious and effectual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001193_0027_0FB0FED9C8861D18"/>
of them. <hi>If they confeſs their iniquity;</hi>—<hi>if then their uncircumciſed heart be humbled, and they then accept the puniſhment of their iniquity: Then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and alſo my Covenant with Iſaac, and alſo my Covenant with Abraham, will I remember, and I will remember the Land, Lev.</hi> 26. 40, 41, 42. God has been in <hi>Covenant</hi> with three Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in this Land; and if we now accept the puniſhment of our ſins, ſurely he will remember his people, his Covenant and his Land.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the moſt proper and only courſe to <hi>Cure</hi> all our Maladies. Our Maladies are great; the ſymptoms grievous, inveterate if not deſperate; <hi>the whole head is ſick, the whole heart is faint, Iſa.</hi> 1. 5. And we have our healers, bleſſed be God for it; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 7. But there's no method, there is no application will be ſo effectual and ſo ſucceſsful as this; it would cure our Moral and our Political, our Eccleſiaſtical and our Civil, our Perſonal and Publick Maladies; it would heal our guilt of Sin which makes ſick. <hi>The Inhabitants ſhall not ſay I am ſick, for the people that dwell therein, ſhall be forgiven their iniquity, Iſa.</hi> 33. 24. It would heal our devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and declenſions, our murmurings, evil jealouſies, our perverſe Spirits, diſtractions and all our breaches; and confirm our hopes and our faith.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will be the only way to extract <hi>Good</hi> out of all our <hi>Evils,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come or coming. Extracts are excellent noble Remedies; when the malignity of the evil is corrected, then it is reconciled, and the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it may be enjoyed; our worſt evils will be <hi>Salubrious,</hi> as far as 'tis poſſible they ſhould be. And all thoſe that will try the experiment, ſhall at leaſt be ſure to ſave their own Souls.—<hi>They ſhould deliver but their own Souls by their Righteouſneſs, ſaith the Lord, Ezek.</hi> 14. 14. And there is as much hope for the whole in this way as any: That yet there may come good out of evil to us; light out of darkneſs, and life out of death, at leaſt in the utmoſt iſſue and event of them: That God will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge us as he did the good figs; And <hi>though a basket of them ſhould be carried into Babylon, it ſhall be for their good;</hi>—<hi>becauſe he will ſet his eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for good.</hi>—<hi>And will give them an heart to know him, that he is the Lord, and they ſhall be his people, and he will be their God, as Jer.</hi> 24. 5, 6, 7. Then he will ariſe for us, and render <hi>a reward to our neighbours, ſeven fold into their boſom, their reproach wherewith they have reproached,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 12. And we may juſtly make the ſame concluſion which the man after Gods own heart did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 12, 13. As for us he will uphold us in our integrity, and ſet us before his face for ever. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting.</hi> Amen, <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>
