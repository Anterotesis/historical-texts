            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THUS was announced to his ſucceſſor, the Head of the Commonwealth of Iſrael, the death of one of the greateſt men, that has ever appeared on this earth. Famed as a great Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, more famed as a profound Legiſlator, and ſkilled as he was in all the knowledge of the age in which he lived, it was ſtill his higheſt praiſe, that he was the ſervant and friend of God, and employed as his chief miniſter in accompliſhing one of the greateſt enterprizes, that was ever undertaken in any age of the world. He was not however permitted fully to complete the vaſt undertaking in which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. After reſcuing his nation from the ſlavery of Egypt, leading them through the many dangers, which attended their long journey in the wilderneſs, and eſtabliſhing over them a wiſe ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Moſes was not ſuffered by Divine Providence to enter the promiſed land, and partake with his people thoſe bleſſings of peace, freedom, and ſafety, he had been ſo eminent an inſtrument in the hand
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038977_0004_10128683A071B1D0"/>
of Heaven in ſecuring to them. He was allowed to behold it at a diſtance from the top of Piſgah; but to conduct them in ſafety through the Jordan, and eſtabliſh them in the land deſtined for their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was the happy privilege of his ſucceſſor.</p>
            <p>The great and good man, whoſe death has been lately announced through our land, and to whoſe memory we are now aſſembled to pay our tribute of reſpect, was favoured above the great Leader and Lawgiver of Iſrael. He has not only been a ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Leader in moſt difficult times and dangerous ſcenes; he has been permitted by Divine Providence to paſs through them all, to ſurvive the ſufferings and dangers of his country, and ſee it, after the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of a ſucceſsful war, eſtabliſhing a ſyſtem of free and efficient government, and under its adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enjoying eminent proſperity, and increaſing with unexampled rapidity in wealth, population and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>He has now left theſe ſublunary ſcenes, full of days and covered with glory, deeply regretted by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and revered by mankind. His death, felt and lamented ſo ſincerely by the inhabitants of this land, is an event which will not be beheld with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in other countries. The world is intereſted in it, for the world has been the witneſs of his actions. His name, which is embalmed in the memory of his fellow-citizens, has long had the admiration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of good men in all countries attached to it; and theſe will neither ceaſe nor be diminiſhed, while greatneſs is reſpected, while wiſdom is admired, while virtue is eſteemed, and goodneſs beloved by mankind.</p>
            <p>As the mournful intelligence ſpreads along the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038977_0005_10128686DE75A738"/>
land, it carries ſorrow and affliction with it. The Preſident, while he
<q>ſympathizes with the nation, and with all good men through the world, in the irreparable loſs ſuſtained by us all,</q>
proclaims him,
<q>the moſt illuſtrious and beloved perſonage this country has ever produced.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Meſſage to Congreſs.</note> The Senate and Repreſentatives of the nation cover themſelves and their houſes of aſſembly in mourning. Our Army is dreſſed in weeds, faint emblem of the loſs it feels! Our Navy hangs out the token of public ſorrow. Our Churches are ſhrouded in black, juſt picture of the gloom that covers every pious patriotic heart! In our cities the buſtle of buſineſs ceaſes,—the houſes of amuſement are cloſed. The ſons of induſtry forego their profit! the diſciples of pleaſure forget their amuſement! No ſound is heard but the funeral knell! no countenance is ſeen but in the viſage of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! For WASHINGTON <hi>is dead!</hi> WASHINGTON, the ſervant of GOD, the lover of his country, the friend of man, is here no more!</p>
            <p>Theſe are the public expreſſions of the public feeling. They are not the mere external marks of faſhionable mourning,—they are not the pomp of affected grief. They are a voluntary tribute of reſpect and gratitude, from hearts impreſſed with a deep ſenſe of the exalted merits and unequalled ſervices of WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>It has ſeldom, if ever before, fallen to the lot of one man to merit and enjoy, living and dying, and through the whole of a long life, ſo high a degree of public eſtimation, and ſo large a ſhare of public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and honour. It has been peculiar to him to ſhare without interruption, for a long time, in the higheſt offices, and in the moſt perplexing and trying
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038977_0006_1012868A840B4F10"/>
ſeaſons of proſperity and adverſity, in war and in peace, the undivided affections of his own country, and the admiration and good opinion of all others; the warmeſt attachment of his friends, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found eſteem even of his enemies. Ages have ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced ſuch an inſtance, and ages may now paſs away before another ſuch ſhall occur!</p>
            <p>For, to produce it requires ſuch a concurrence of circumſtances, as can, in the nature of things, but ſeldom take place. It is not in talents even of the firſt order, united with virtues of the brighteſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and moſt unſpotted purity, alone to produce ſuch a character as that of WASHINGTON. Theſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed qualities of the mind and of the heart muſt meet in one, whoſe ſituation is ſuch as to furniſh the means and opportunity for their higheſt cultivation and improvement, before they are brought into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they muſt happen ſo to meet at a time and in a country, which preſent an opportunity for their full exerciſe and perfect diſplay; when, by great events taking place, a theatre for action is opened, in magnitude and importance equal to them.</p>
            <p>But it is rare that talents ſo eminent and various; and virtues ſo pure and ſplendid, meet in the ſame perſon; ſtill more rare is it for them to meet in a perſon, whoſe ſituation is ſuch, as to have them brought into public view; and yet more uncommon ſtill for all theſe circumſtances to concur at a time, when great and intereſting events call for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and public diſplay.</p>
            <p>And when God, for accompliſhing important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of his providence, has cauſed all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſingularly to conſpire to form one of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038977_0007_1012868ECE14A510"/>
greateſt characters, that has appeared in any country, in ancient or modern times; it is undoubtedly our duty to pay it a grateful and reſpectful homage. We are to view him, in whom it appears, as the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter of God, raiſed up and commiſſioned by him to execute important purpoſes of his providence, and render eſſential ſervices to mankind. In thus hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring the inſtrument, we honour him who appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who employs, who directs,—and who, at his ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign pleaſure, ſuſpends it. To contemplate ſuch a character has further a natural tendency to produce ſome good effect on our own; and by noticing ſuch an example, there is a hope that we may be led, in ſome degree, to the imitation of it.</p>
            <p>You will expect me, as an eſſential part of my duty on this ſolemn occaſion, to attempt a character of that illuſtrious ſervant of God, whoſe life diſplayed ſo many and ſuch diſtinguiſhed talents and virtues, and whoſe death occaſions ſo great and univerſal mourning. But it is with diffidence and heſitation I venture on a part of my duty, to which I feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo unequal. My means of information are very inadequate to a juſt performance of the taſk. I have only ſeen him, as you all have, at a diſtance, in his public life, and in his public official writings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, with the moſt accurate knowledge of the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, principles, maxims, conduct, and events which have conſpired to form a character; it requires pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar talents to place ſuch an one as that of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON in its juſt point of light. The clouds of heaven exhibit auguſt and majeſtic appearances. We all behold them with reſpect, and have ſome juſt idea of their form and motions; but it demands the hand
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038977_0008_101286906988DFA0"/>
of a maſter to trace them on the canvas. The ſun is a glorious and reſplendent body. We all ſee its brightneſs, and feel its warmth; but where is the pencil that dares undertake to delineate it! The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Waſhington, ſtrongly marked as the features of his character are, is impreſſed on all our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in lively colours; yet, to reflect this image, ſo as to preſerve the unity of the whole, and the diſtinct characteriſtic of each of its parts, would require a mirror of more perfect poliſh, than you are to expect in a mind of ordinary ſtructure.</p>
            <p>Permit me then only to ſay, that the image of this great man is not like that of moſt others, who have ſhone with diſtinguiſhed luſtre in the annals of the world. It is not compoſed of ſome bright ſpots ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with dark ſhades, ſo as to dazzle without enlightening the beholder. His character is not an aſſemblage of great talents by the ſide of great defects, and ſplendid virtues contaminated by their vicinity to atrocious vices. He ſhone with a clear and ſteady luſtre, which, if it ſeldom appeared with flaſhes of ſplendor to dazzle and aſtoniſh, was yet never min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ſhades, nor intercepted by clouds. The circumſtance, which ſeems to diſtinguiſh his name from that of all others, is not the pre-eminence of any one talent or virtue; but, a unity of character, reſulting from the perfect combination and exact balancing of all thoſe great and good qualities, which enter into the character of one, who is to poſſeſs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic eſteem, guide public opinion, and command uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſpect and confidence. A countenance, a fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, and a manner, which impreſſed awe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded attention, were in him but the index of a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038977_0009_1012869439742528"/>
mind, and the evidences of a heart, which deſerved them.</p>
            <p>It may be uſeful however to be more diſtinct in our view; and in order to ſhow what Waſhington was, and how he became the glory of this country and the admiration of others, to review the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts of his public life, to ſtudy him in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the hiſtory of our country for the laſt forty-five, eſpecially the laſt twenty-five years, and to read his character in all that has come from his pen. We will ſet aſide the eulogies of oratory, and the panegyrics which poetry has delighted to ſhed upon him. The partiality of friends and the enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm of admirers may flatter and deceive, and we are always diſpoſed to diſtruſt their teſtimony; but actions ſpeak for themſelves, and a man's own writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, eſpecially in a courſe of correſpondence, which neceſſarily led him to the conſtant expoſure of the motives, the plans, and the ſucceſs or ill-ſucceſs of his conduct, will certainly be admitted as deciſive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and can hardly fail to diſplay his true charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and exhibit him to our view in his juſt light.</p>
            <p>It is in the great events of our revolutionary war, and its glorious and happy iſſue; the modeſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of himſelf, reliance on the candor and ſupport of his country, and pious truſt in the God of armies, with which he accepted the command of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can armies; the firmneſs, humanity and military ſkill with which he executed the high truſt, and the dignity with which, after accompliſhing for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try all the purpoſes of his commiſſion, he reſigned his command and returned to private life; it is in the patriotic readineſs with which, at the call of his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038977_0010_1012869736EE4180"/>
country, he again quitted his favourite retreat, and conſented, when the world thought he had nothing to gain and every thing to loſe, at an advanced period of life, to place all his well-earned glory at hazard, by accepting the moſt important and moſt difficult truſt in the gift of his country; it is in the profound political knowledge, unſhaken integrity, and faithful exertions to promote the good of his country, which he diſplayed for the ſame number of years in peace, as he had gloriouſly conducted her armies in war; it is in the pious ſenſe of dependence on Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he manifeſted in every public ſcene and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of his life, and the reſpectful modeſty, united with dignified firmneſs, the deep penetration, vaſt extent of views, and uncommon foreſight, which appear in all his official communications and public correſpondences; it is in the uniform and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteadineſs he maintained in every change of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and viciſſitude of fortune, not elated by proſperity nor depreſſed by adverſity, not flattered by adulation nor irritated by calumny, not alarmed by danger nor thrown off his guard by fancied ſafety, ſo as ever, in his public character, to do a raſh thing or ſay an unguarded one, or ſo as to precipitate himſelf into circumſtances unforeſeen, or for which he was unprovided; it is in his ſuperiority to the charms of greatneſs and thirſt for power, and the great example of moderation he gave the world, when he once more retired from his high ſtation to ſpend the remainder of his days as a private citizen; it is in that true greatneſs of ſoul and diſintereſted regard for the public good, he diſplayed in accepting an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment under his ſucceſſor in the Preſidency, when
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038977_0011_1012869B64C135D0"/>
the exigencies of his country ſeemed again to call for his great talents, and great influence and weight of character to be employed in her ſervice; it is, in fact, in the whole tenor of his conduct, which hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory has recorded, which his grateful country has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with unanimous approbation, with unlimited confidence and undivided attachment, and which fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generations will not ceaſe to contemplate with admiration and reverence, that we are to ſeek for the character of this great man.</p>
            <p>The preſent generation is convinced, and poſterity, when it reads the hiſtory of the times in which he lived, will never doubt, his having united in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon all thoſe great qualities of the mind and good properties of the heart, which the world, not always ſo juſt, has agreed in attributing to him.</p>
            <p>His entrance on the great theatre of public action, which we may date at the commencement of the American revolution, placed him in a commanding attitude to the view of the world, and intimated what was to be expected from his patriotiſm, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity, his abilities, and his ſenſe of duty. To take the command of an undiſciplined army, which was to operate againſt veteran troops and experienced generals; in a conteſt with one of the moſt wealthy and powerful nations of Europe; at a time when public opinion was much divided in reſpect to the right and expediency of reſorting to arms, and when it could not but be doubtful whether the reſources, or the courage, or the fortitude of the country, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the juſtice of the cauſe, would be equal to the conflict, and continue to ſupport him; muſt have happened either from an inconſiderate unreflecting
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038977_0012_1012869D00BF0A40"/>
raſhneſs, or from a deliberate ſenſe of duty, and a patriotic readineſs to ſerve his country, connected with a daring, yet cool intrepidity of character.— From which of theſe it did in fact reſult, we can be at no loſs, after attending to the manner in which he executed the truſt.</p>
            <p>In the organization of his army, in the ſelection and diſpoſition of his officers, in the plans of his campaigns, and in the general mode of conducting the war, he diſplayed the talents of the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</p>
            <p>In his vigilant and ceaſeleſs care to manage with the utmoſt economy, at the ſame time with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt effect, the reſources of his country; and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to be benefitted by them himſelf by receiving any compenſation for his ſervices, he manifeſted, that while he was ſuperior to motives of private emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he had a great regard for the public intereſt.</p>
            <p>His uniform reſpect for the civil authority, and the ſcrupulous obedience he always paid it, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his accurate ideas of the foundation and nature of civil liberty, and evinced that he was equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from holding the principle, or countenancing the practice of deſpotiſm in any form; and that he had a juſt abhorrence of the encroachment of one branch of power on the rights of another.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral actions in which his perſon was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and the coolneſs, intrepidity, and intelligence with which he conducted them, teſtify to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal bravery.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral inſtances in which he diſcovered daring enterpriſe, and practiſed ſucceſsful ſtratagem, are brilliant monuments of his military genius.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:038977_0013_101286A04697A710"/>His unremitting attention to the lives, health, and comfort of his ſoldiery, his care to avoid the unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary effuſion of blood, and his reluctance to retaliate cruelties on the enemy, appear as pleaſing evidences, that to his other great virtues he added the leſs ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, but not leſs amiable one of humanity.</p>
            <p>His holding together, year after year, an army compoſed of freemen, unaccuſtomed to the hardſhips of a camp, and the neceſſary rigour of military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, —moſt of the time but poorly paid, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indifferently fed, and often badly clothed;— in the face of an enemy often ſuperior in numbers, and always enjoying every advantage of diſcipline, military habits, and adequate ſupplies;—his doing this in ſuch a manner as to overcome all obſtacles, inceſſantly to annoy and diſtreſs, and ſometimes to obtain brilliant advantages over an enemy purſuing him with ſuperior forces, is a ſtrong and deciſive teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to his unconquerable conſtancy and patience, and the vaſt reſources of his mind. Common ſpirits would have ſunk under the complicated perplexities and conſtantly increaſing difficulties he had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. Overcome by diſappointments, harraſſed by oppreſſive and vexatious cares, and chagrined by the want of adequate ſupport, and of ſupplies equal to exiſting exigencies, they would have deſpaired of their country, and abandoned her cauſe. With him, they ſerved only to call forth the energies of a mind always ſupplied with new reſources, and ready to encounter new difficulties and dangers.</p>
            <p>In acquiring and maintaining without interruption the entire confidence of the army, the government, and the people at large, through the whole courſe of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038977_0014_101286A4C0F452E0"/>
a war always diſtreſſing and often unfortunate,— bringing it to a happy concluſion, and then retiring to private life, loaded with the benedictions and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the prayers of millions, he ſhowed that all his conduct, while it ſprung from the beſt motives, muſt have been regulated with conſummate pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and dictated by an accurate knowledge of human nature. It furniſhed unqueſtionable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that, with the great talents of the commander, he had the mild virtues of the citizen; that with the courage, enterpriſe, and vigour of the ſoldier, he had the moderation of the philoſopher; that while he was formed to acquire fame by achieving great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was alſo calculated to gain eſteem, attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and confidence by performing good ones, and by being evidently governed in all his public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate tranſactions by the pureſt principles and a ſteady ſenſe of duty.</p>
            <p>Behold him again, when experience had taught his country the neceſſity of an efficient government to embrace the intereſts, and to enſure the ſafety, proſperity, union, and independence of an extenſive and growing empire, at the head of an aſſembly of ſages, ſelected by his country to form ſuch a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of government; and after it was formed, and adopted by the people, twice placed, by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſuffrages of his fellow-citizens, in the firſt office in the adminiſtration of it! Hitherto he had been chiefly diſtinguiſhed as a military character, He is now to be admired and to ſhine with equal ſplendor as a ſtateſman.</p>
            <p>Far from being puffed up with the pride of office, dazzled with the glare of greatneſs, or corrupted by
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038977_0015_101286A659CCA8F8"/>
the exerciſe of power to the improper love of it and a wiſh to increaſe it; you ſee him ſupporting the dignity of his ſtation with modeſty, performing the duties of it with wiſdom and fidelity, keeping ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly within the limits of his conſtitutional au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and firmly preventing encroachment and uſurpation in others, which, by deſtroying the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary balance eſtabliſhed by the conſtitution, muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the fair fabric of the government; and in his whole adminiſtration manifeſting an ardent and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love of his country, a ſtrong ſenſe of duty, and a pious dependence on the bleſſing of heaven for all the ſucceſs attending his honeſt and well-meant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to promote the proſperity of his country and the happineſs of his fellow-citizens.</p>
            <p>We ſee him the ſame WASHINGTON in peace, that he had been in war,—at the head of the nation, that he had been at the head of the army; exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame ſkill in organizing the government, that he had done in organizing the army,—diſplaying the ſame abilities in the cabinet, he had done in the field; the ſame prudence to avoid difficulties and dangers, the ſame courage to encounter them, the ſame forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to bear them, and the ſame reſources to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf and his country from them. We ſee him, by purſuing a ſteady and uniform courſe in his adminiſtration at home, and adhering inflexibly to the principles of juſtice and good faith, and a pacific policy in his tranſactions with other nations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding reſpect abroad, and ſtill maintaining the confidence and firm attachment of his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. We ſee him, as ſoon as the ſtate of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would permit, voluntarily retiring from public
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038977_0016_101286A933A8AF88"/>
life to reſume the freedom and enjoy the eaſe of a private citizen; thus, after having eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, through the whole of his public life, every virtue which can adorn the man, the ſoldier, the ſtateſman, and the chriſtian, at the cloſe of it furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rare inſtance of republican principle and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic moderation.</p>
            <p>Thus conſtituted by nature, thus formed by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and thus ſituated by circumſtances, he became the pride of his country, the ornament of human nature, the admiration of mankind,—the glory of the preſent age, and the example of future genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But here I pauſe. The grave pays no reſpect to greatneſs, no deference to worth, no attention to the prayers of a nation, no regard to the tears of the world! It makes no diſtinction in favour of the great, the wiſe, and the good,—the benefactors of mankind, and ſupporters of ſociety. Theſe, as well as the meaneſt and moſt uſeleſs members of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial body, muſt be laid low in the duſt.</p>
            <p>But when, by the wiſe appointment of Heaven, men of the firſt diſtinction and uſefulneſs are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with the dead; amidſt the tumult of ſorrow and the deep and general ſenſe of public loſs, the event is uſually accompanied with its conſolations. In the event we now feel, and commemorate with ſuch deep and ſincere affliction, there are conſolatory conſiderations, which ought on this occaſion to be brought to view.</p>
            <p>One of a very obvious nature is, that he, whoſe death we mourn, has left the world at a time moſt favourable for the perfection of his own character.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038977_0017_101286AB28CBB1F0"/>
Nothing further was wanting to render it complete. He had lived to acquire all the glory, that one man could acquire. He had arrived to old age without one ſtain on his fair reputation. He had no new fame to gain by living longer. In his laſt public act, by conſenting to place his reputation once more at hazard, at a time of life, when, though there was yet no apparent diminution of the vigour of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he could hardly expect, had he been called into the field, to continue long capable of acting with the ſame vigour as in the meridian of life, he had given a very ſtrong proof of the ſincerity of his patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, —that it was indeed ſuperior to all perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of eaſe or fame. For he certainly thus expoſed himſelf to the danger of acting for the good of his country, beyond what was perfectly ſafe for his own reputation, and beyond what a predominant regard for <hi>that</hi> would have dictated. A deciſive ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, had any been wanting, of the ſincerity, ſtrength, and purity of his love of his country.</p>
            <p>He had beſides lived to be fully gratified in this, his ruling paſſion, by ſeeing his nation, to whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had devoted the beſt part of his life, happy in a good conſtitution of government, and a faithful adminiſtration; and rapidly progreſſing in wealth, reſpectability, and the means of proſperity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>Another conſolatory reflection, which cheered the good heart of that great man in his laſt days, and ought to cheer ours now, is one which alſo reſpects the ſtate of our country. He had lived to ſee the adminiſtration of the government going on well in the hands of a ſucceſſor; and we have found by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038977_0018_101286B1539DCE08"/>
experience, that God has raiſed up others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in the path of glory and uſefulneſs, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of managing with ſkill and ſucceſs our great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concerns. It is true, the preſent poſture of our country, both in regard to its internal ſtate and its foreign relations, is critical and hazardous. It calls for great vigilance, firmneſs, and ability, and great weight of authority in the Supreme Executive, to maintain its poſition, preſerve its independence, and ſecure the reſpect of other nations, and keep tranquillity at home. But experience of the talents and fidelity of the preſent adminiſtration has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and greatly increaſed the public confidence in it. And this increaſe of the public confidence is the ſureſt pledge we can have, that it will be ſucceſsful. We thus truſt in God, that it will be poſſible for us to maintain our independence and ſupport our free government, though we have no longer to depend on the talents and the name of WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>But the moſt conſolatory conſideration, and one which ought to excite ſtrong and univerſal ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of gratitude is, that his life was prolonged to ſo great an extent; and that he had opportunities of rendering us ſo many, ſuch various, and ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſervices, under circumſtances ſo important and peculiar, and which required ſuch eminent talents, and called for ſuch uncommon popularity. It was a peculiar ſmile of heaven on our land, that a life ſo valuable was preſerved through the dark days and trying ſcenes of our country; that he was permitted to aid us through a diſtreſſing war, and afterward, in peace, to contribute the weight of his character, as well as the fidelity of his labours and the vigilance
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038977_0019_101286B2E948F458"/>
of his care, to ſettle the affairs of the nation, and to eſtabliſh and organize the government. This ſhould not ceaſe to call forth our moſt fervent gratitude to Heaven, and awaken this day the ſtrongeſt ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our hearts.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not do juſtice to this occaſion, and the duty you have aſſigned me, were I not now to call your very ſerious attention to ſome improvement of this ſolemn and affecting diſpenſation of providence. It is the dictate of patriotiſm and a duty of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, while we revere the hand of Heaven in an event ſo afflictive, to liſten to the admonition it carries with it, and to profit by the leſſons of intereſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction it conveys. A death, which cauſes the tears of a nation to flow, has its important uſes. It is a ſolemn admonition of the inſtability of all human greatneſs, and an affecting inſtance to aſſure us, that neither wiſdom nor worth can reſcue from the grave.</p>
            <p>To all who are in public authority, to all who have the important intereſts of their country intruſted to them, this event ſhould come with deep impreſſions of their reſponſibility. It ſhould excite ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on their obligations to ſociety, and on the account they muſt render of their fidelity in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of thoſe obligations, to him who has all the affairs and all the intereſts of ſociety in his hands.</p>
            <p>To every grade of office in ſociety there is attached a degree of reſponſibility, proportioned to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the duties, and the extenſiveneſs of the influence, of that office. Every man of principle will enter on any public truſt committed to him, with a ſtrong ſenſe of this reſponſibility. He will carry it with him, and cheriſh it with zeal in all the duties of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038977_0020_101286B652FE6188"/>
his office; and it will be impreſſed on him with new and peculiar force, when he ſees one, who has ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the higheſt offices, who has had the higheſt truſts repoſed in him, and been called to act in the moſt conſpicuous, the moſt intereſting, and moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult ſituations, ſummoned to appear at the bar of a righteous God, to be recompenſed according to the rectitude of his principles and the fidelity of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
            <p>This event ſhould admoniſh us all not to <hi>put our truſt in man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help;</hi> but, looking to <hi>men</hi> only as the <hi>inſtruments</hi> of Heaven for accompliſhing the great purpoſes of providence, to fix our hope ſteadfaſtly in God, and place our ſafety and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in his hands, who was the God of our fathers, and who will never forſake us their children, if we place our whole truſt and hope in him.</p>
            <p>When great and good men are raiſed up to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form eminent ſervices in very critical times,—to guide a people by their wiſdom, prudence, conſtancy, and fidelity, through perilous ſcenes, and raiſe their country to glory and proſperity; we ought to be grateful for their ſervices, to love and reſpect them while living, and to honour their memory when they are dead. But to place all our dependence on any one man as the ark of our ſafety, and to conſider all our political intereſts as ſuſpended on his life, would be the height of imprudence,—the madneſs of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm. It would betray an impious diſtruſt of the power or goodneſs of Providence; as if, when its inſtruments for doing good had accompliſhed their end, it could not raiſe up others to ſupply their places,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038977_0021_101286B7EABE9C98"/>
according as the exigencies of mankind ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them!</p>
            <p>This event ſhould accordingly teach us, while we deeply regret the loſs of departed worth, far from deſpairing of the protection of Heaven, far from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting its future care, and far from feeling a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſufficiency of its inſtruments to ſecure our ſafety and promote our proſperity, to turn our eyes with hope and confidence to LIVING WORTH, and to value, eſteem, and honour it. To what, my friends, was it owing, that Waſhington had it in his power to do ſo much good for his country? Was it not greatly owing to the confidence, which was placed in him by the people? I would not detract from his abilities, or leſſen your opinion of his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. I do believe them both to have been of the very firſt order and pureſt kind. But, with the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and virtues of an angel of heaven, I aſk, whether he could have performed for his country the ſervices he did, had he been looked upon with jealouſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with ſuſpicion, thwarted in all his views, oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his plans, and counteracted in his exertions? had the motives of his conduct been perpetually called in queſtion, and calumny permitted to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from him the ſupport and good opinion of his fellow-citizens?</p>
            <p>Let it not, O my country! let it not be the baſe ſtain of thy character, while thou honoureſt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of thy defenders who are gone, to blacken the names of thoſe who ſurvive; while thou <hi>buildeſt the tombs of thy dead prophets, to ſtone the living!</hi> While, with an honourable zeal, we pay the tribute of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to deceaſed merit, and remember with gratitude
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038977_0022_101286BC83704B78"/>
the ſervices of thoſe, who are no more; let us, my dear fellow-citizens, be juſt to the living! Let the fidelity of paſt ſervices give a confidence in the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and ability, which are to render future ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. And having placed our Rulers in ſtations, in which we expect them to do us good, let us not do them the injuſtice, nor ourſelves the injury, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from them that confidence and ſupport, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it will be with diffidence, with embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with hazard, that they attempt to ſerve us. Their beſt plans for promoting the public good may be prevented from execution, their moſt patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic exertions may be defeated, and their moſt wiſe and faithful ſervices prove ineffectual, unleſs we their conſtituents, after putting the adminiſtration of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment into their hands, are ready to aid them in it with our cheerful confidence and firm ſupport.</p>
            <p>There is one further improvement we ought to make of the mournful event, which we this day no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. It is, to reſpect the prudent admonitions of our now departed friend; and to cheriſh a proper regard for thoſe juſt principles of government, and lend a merited attention to thoſe wiſe maxims of moral and political conduct, which in the courſe of his public life, and particularly at the cloſe of it, he inculcated with all the ſincerity and zeal of friendſhip, and with all the ſolicitude of paternal concern.</p>
            <p>We have all read and admired his public official papers, his proclamations, his circular letter at the cloſe of our revolutionary war, and his moſt valuable addreſs to the inhabitants of the United States, when he announced his reſolution of quitting the Preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial chair. It is now for us to do ſomething more
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038977_0023_101286C0C83034E8"/>
than admire. We ſhould be ſolicitous, as far as our individual practice is concerned, or our influence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, to promote the great purpoſes in view in that excellent addreſs, in which he laſt, and moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, appeared as the <hi>Father of his country,</hi> by aſſuming the peculiar right of a father, to counſel, admoniſh, and warn.</p>
            <p>This we ſhall do, when we exert ourſelves to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote that ſpirit of union, he ſo earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, by laying aſide party ſpirit and the uſe of party names, by rejecting geographical diſtinctions and local prejudices, and endeavouring to perpetuate the integrity, and ſtrengthen the bonds of the union: when we ſubmit to the laws of the land, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a cheerful ſubjection to all the conſtituted authorities; always diſcountenancing a ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and the diſpoſition of the minority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol the majority; a ſpirit utterly oppoſed to the firſt principles of republican liberty, and incompatible with order and peace: when we encourage religion, morals, and literature, and the inſtitutions for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting them: when we cheriſh public credit, by uſing it as ſparingly as poſſible, and adopting the moſt rigid and exact economy: when we avoid all unneceſſary foreign connexions, all national attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and antipathies, preferences and hatreds; and, while we obſerve good faith, with ſcrupulous and conſcientious fidelity, with all nations, ſhun with caution the influence and aſcendency of any; not only ſo as to guard our public counſels from being polluted; but alſo ſo as to preſerve public opinion, which, in a free government, muſt always regulate them, from being contaminated: when we preſerve
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038977_0024_101286C262638B08"/>
in fact a neutral poſition, as far as it can be preſerved, and ſteadily purſue a pacific policy, in reſpect to the nations of Europe, with whoſe relative intereſts we have no concern, and in whoſe contentions it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable to take no part. Theſe laſt are indeed dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by maxims of conduct, which relate <hi>immediately</hi> to the government, and not to individuals: but as the acts of government, under elective forms, are but the expreſſions of the public opinion and will, it is in the power of each individual to contribute ſomething toward forming and expreſſing that public opinion; and it becomes important for him to take care, that he do it with fidelity, and with a ſacred regard to theſe maxims of political wiſdom, and principles of political rectitude.</p>
            <p>Such is a ſketch of thoſe good counſels, impreſſed on us by our departed friend, which we ought to preſerve with the ſame fidelity and zeal, that we cheriſh the memory of him, who with ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſo feeling an intereſt in the future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the United States, has inculcated them upon us, admoniſhed us of their importance, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to our frequent review.</p>
