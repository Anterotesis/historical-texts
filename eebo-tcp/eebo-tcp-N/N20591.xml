            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <lg>
               <l>SPRUNG from a race that long had till'd the ſoil</l>
               <l>And firſt dis-rob'd it of its native trees,</l>
               <l>He choſe to heir their lands, but not their toil,</l>
               <l>And thought the ploughman's life no life of eaſe—</l>
               <l>"'Tis wrong (thought he) theſe pretty hands to wound</l>
               <l>"With felling oaks, or delving in the ground:</l>
               <l>"I who, at leaſt have forty pounds in caſh</l>
               <l>"And in a country ſtore might cut a daſh,</l>
               <l>"Why ſhould I till theſe barren fields (he ſaid)</l>
               <l>("I who have learnt to cypher, write, and read)</l>
               <l>"Theſe fields that ſhrubs, and weeds, and brambles bear,</l>
               <l>"That pay me not, and only bring me care?"</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some thoughts had he, long while, to quit the ſod</l>
               <l>In ſea-port towns to try his luck in trade,</l>
               <l>But then their ways of living ſeem'd moſt odd —</l>
               <l>For duſty ſtreets to leave his native ſhade,</l>
               <l>From graſſy plats to pebbled walks remov'd—</l>
               <l>The more he thought of them the leſs he lov'd:</l>
               <l>The city-ſprings he could not drink; and ſtill</l>
               <l>Preferr'd the fountain, underneath the hill.—</l>

               <l>It would have puzzled Fauſtus to have told,</l>
               <l>What did attach him to this paltry ſpot</l>
               <l>Where even the houſe he heir'd was very old,</l>
               <l>And half his fences hardly worth a groat:</l>
               <l>Yet ſo it was, the fancy took his brain</l>
               <l>A country ſhop might here ſome cuſtom gain:—</l>
               <l>Whiſkey, he knew, would always be in vogue</l>
               <l>While there are country ſquires to take a cogue,</l>
               <l>Laces and lawns would draw each rural maid,</l>

               <l>Hard by the road a pigmy building ſtood,</l>
               <l>Thatch'd was its roof, and earthen were its floors:</l>
               <l>So ſmall its ſize, that (in a jeſting mood)</l>
               <l>It might he call'd a houſe turn'd out of doors—</l>
               <l>Yet here, adjacent to an aged oak</l>
               <l>Full fifty years <hi>old dad</hi> his hams did ſmoke,</l>
               <l>Nor ceas'd the trade, till worn with years, and ſpent,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Hither our merchant turn'd his curious eye</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>BESIDE a ſtream that never yet ran dry,</l>
                  <l>There ſtands, a TOWN, not high advanced in fame;</l>
                  <l>Tho' few its buildings, rais'd to pleaſe the eye,</l>
                  <l>Still this proud title it may fairly claim;</l>
                  <l>A <hi>Tavern</hi> (its firſt requiſite) is there,</l>
                  <l>A <hi>mill</hi> a <hi>black-ſmith's ſhop,</hi> a <hi>houſe of prayer.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Nay, more—a little market-houſe is ſeen</l>
                  <l>And iron hooks where beef was never hung,</l>
                  <l>Nor pork, nor bacon, poultry fat or lean,</l>
                  <l>Pigs head, or ſauſage link, or bullock's tongue:</l>
                  <l>Look when you will, you ſee the vacant bench</l>
                  <l>No butcher ſeated there, no country wench.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Great aims were his, who firſt contriv'd this town;</l>
                  <l>A market he would have,—but, humbled now,</l>
                  <l>Sighing we ſee its fabrick mouldring down,</l>
                  <l>That only ſerves at night to pen the cow:</l>
                  <l>And hence, by way of jeſting, may be ſaid,</l>
                  <l>That beef is there, tho' never beef that's dead.</l>

                  <l>A breaſt the inn—a tree before the door,</l>
                  <l>A Printing-Office lifts its humble head,</l>
                  <l>Where maſter <hi>Type</hi> old journals doth explore</l>
                  <l>For news that is thro' all the village read;</l>
                  <l>Who, year from year, (ſo cruel is his lot)</l>
                  <l>Is author, preſſman, devil—and what not?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Fame ſays he is an odd and curious wight,</l>
                  <l>Fond to diſtraction of his native place</l>
                  <l>In ſenſe not very dull nor very bright,</l>
                  <l>Yet ſhows ſome marks of humour in his face,</l>
                  <l>One who can pen an anecdote complete,</l>
                  <l>Or plague the parſon with the mackled ſheet.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Three times a week by nimble geldings drawn</l>
                  <l>A ſtage arrives but ſcarcely deigns to ſtop,</l>
                  <l>Unleſs the driver far in liquor gone</l>
                  <l>Has made ſome buſineſs for the black-ſmith-ſhop,</l>
                  <l>Then comes this printer's harveſt-time of news,</l>
                  <l>Welcome alike from Chriſtians, Turks, or Jews.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>All is not <hi>Truth</hi> ('tis ſaid) that travellers tell—</l>
                  <l>So much the better for this man of news:</l>
                  <l>For hence, the country round that know him well,</l>
                  <l>Will, if he prints ſome lies, his lies excuſe.</l>
                  <l>Earthquakes, and battles, ſhipwrecks, myriads ſlain—</l>

                  <l>But if this motley tribe ſay nothing new,</l>
                  <l>Then many a lazy, longing look is caſt</l>
                  <l>To watch the weary poſt-boy travelling through,</l>
                  <l>On horſe's rump, his budget buckled faſt;</l>
                  <l>With letters ſafe in leathern priſon pent</l>
                  <l>And wet from preſs, full many a packet ſent.</l>
