            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS day, a very large and extenſive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exhibit every token of funeral ſorrow.—Wherever we turn our eyes, we behold the ſignals of mourning diſplayed.—The countenance of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery American citizen proclaims, in ſilent accents, that man is mortal; that no character, or ſtation in life, exempts from the irrevocable ſentence, <hi>"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR <hi>WASHINGTON</hi> IS NO MORE!—Had he continued to this day, he would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted ſixty eight years; but the LORD of all worlds, who gave him as our deliverer, has ſeen fit to call him hence; he departed this life the 14th of December laſt.—And, under the preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, reflecting on paſt events, may we not experimentally comment upon the words of the text, and apply them to ourſelves, as they were applied to Iſrael, reſpecting the Divine conduct towards them;—"the LORD raiſed up a deliverer to the children of Iſrael."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:039133_0004_1013E8F596DD9B70"/>
In the time of our diſtreſs, the LORD, in like manner, raiſed up a deliverer to his American Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. That we may rightly underſtand the buſineſs, for which we are convened, it may be inquired, to whom are we to offer theſe honours? To of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to the dead, would be very unſuitable. To GOD only, in memory of the dead, may ſuch offerings be paid.</p>
            <p>In order, therefore, that we may properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize our loſs, and ſenſibly feel our obligations of gratitude to the Moſt High GOD, for paſt favours; ſome general obſervations upon this paſſage of Scripture, by way of analogy, will now be made; which may lead to a more particular improvement.</p>
            <p>As from a ſtate of Egyptian bondage, the LORD brought Iſrael to poſſeſs the land of Canaan; ſo from a ſtate of oppreſſion, the LORD conducted our Fore-Fathers to inherit this land, that here they might peaceably enjoy that religion which they could not in their native country.</p>
            <p>The obſtacles which obſtructed Iſrael when entering upon their inheritance, were many and great; and the interpoſitions of Providence were wonderful in fulfilling the promiſe of this event, which was made to Abraham, that his ſeed ſhould poſſeſs that land. Great alſo were the dangers which our Progenitors encountered, and ſignal were the diſplays of Divine goodneſs, in their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling in this then uncultivated wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:039133_0005_1013E8F71FEB18C8"/>
Iſrael, for a long time, flouriſhed in their new ſettlements; even ſo long as they ſerved the LORD, they ſat down quietly, having none to make them afraid; for the LORD was their defence. No leſs did the LORD give reſt to his people, in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbian land; and defended the vine, which his own right hand had planted, from the violence of all thoſe who roſe up againſt them.</p>
            <p>At this period, referred to by the Divine hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, Iſrael, becauſe they had ſinned, were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppreſſed by a foreign nation, into whoſe hand the LORD had ſold them for their tranſgreſſion againſt him: Thus they were greatly diſtreſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Meſopotamians reigned over them. In their trouble, they cried unto the LORD, and the LORD heard them, and raiſed up for them a deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erer—even Othniel, the ſon of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother: And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him; and the LORD delivered Iſrael by his hand. Not unſimilar was the ſtate of our nation, when our liberties were attacked by the power of Britain.</p>
            <p>We may learn ſomething of our critical ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at that time, if we revert back to the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble period of the maſſacre at Boſton, which took place in the year of our LORD 1770. After that, the circumſtances grew more threatening, and the dangers were greatly increaſed, by the enforcing of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> and other unreaſonable <hi>duties,</hi> which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039133_0006_1013E8F90A32C760"/>
occaſioned the deſtruction of <hi>tea</hi> in the year 1773. The conſternation from that time ſpread far and wide, ſo that the ſeveral States, each one conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their own ſafety, ſent Delegates, who met at Philadelphia, September 5th, 1774, to form a <hi>Union,</hi> and to adopt meaſures to defend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, humanly ſpeaking, how <hi>weak,</hi> if compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe by whom they were oppoſed! How unprepared for <hi>War,</hi> as to military ſkill, and war-like equipments! Without any eſtabliſhed form of Government, or public reſources!</p>
            <p>Under theſe diſtreſſing circumſtances, what could Congreſs do? Having organized them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they endeavoured to aſſert the rights to which the Colonies were entitled by the laws of nature, the principles of the Engliſh Conſtitution, and their ſeveral Charters. Among thoſe rights, were conſidered Life, Liberty, and Property; a right to diſpoſe of which, without their conſent, they had given to no ſovereign power whatever. Yet, rather than raſhly to ſet up for Independence, they ſue for peace, by way of entreaty.</p>
            <p>Now, leaving the infant Republic, trembling through fear, yet firmly aſſerting her native right, while ſhe ſtretches out the ſuppliant hand, ſeeking a juſt redreſs of her wrongs; we may, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, turn our eyes on the ſide of our unnatural enemy: And we behold them, a great and mighty

nation, renowned in all the arts of war, furniſhed with every needed ſupply, maſters of the ſea, and deaf to all propoſals of accommodation ſhort of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional ſubmiſſion.—Vain, O America! was the help of man! This, our political Fathers ſaw, in the day of our calamity. Therefore the Congreſs, June 7th, 1775, reſolved, that Thurſday, July 20th, be obſerved, throughout the Twelve United Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as a day of humiliation, faſting, and prayer. Thus in the day of their affliction, they cried unto the LORD.</p>
            <p>It was now needful, that ſome one ſhould be appointed Commander in Chief, on whom it ſhould devolve to manage the whole war. June 15th, the Congreſs, by ballot, unanimouſly choſe <hi>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</hi> Eſq. to this office. He was then in the 43d year of his age.—From early life he had been trained up for ſuch a day as <hi>this:</hi> amply furniſhed with military ſkill and political knowledge—and had now arrived to mature age for renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exploits. A ſpecimen of <hi>his</hi> character, whom GOD raiſed up as our deliverer, and to whom our country entruſted all which they held dear, we may ſee in his anſwer when invited to accept his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. The Preſident of the Houſe requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his acceptance. He, <hi>(Washington)</hi> ſtanding in his place, ſaid:</p>

                  <p>THOUGH I am truly ſenſible of the high honour done me, in this appointment, yet I feel great diſtreſs, from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs

that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the extenſive and important truſt.

                  <p>But, leſt ſome unlucky event ſhould happen, unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered, by every gentleman in the room, that I this day declare, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſincerity, I do not think myſelf equal to the command I am honoured with.</p>
                  <p>"As to pay, Sir, I beg leave to aſſure the Congreſs, that, as no pecuniary conſideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment, at the expenſe of my domeſtic eaſe and happineſs, I do not wiſh to make any profit from it. I will keep an exact account of my expenſes: Thoſe, I doubt not, they will diſcharge—and that is all I deſire.</p>

            <p>From that day, the eyes of all were turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as the Commander in Chief of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can forces. This office he filled, to the great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his fellow citizens, to the terror of his enemies, and to the aſtoniſhment of the world;—manifeſting, on all occaſions, fidelity, ſkill, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and reſolution; till at length he obtained for the United Independent States. an honourable peace, which was ratified by Great Britain in the year 1784.</p>
            <p>How HE, who ruleth among the nations, has improved him as an inſtrument of ſaving his peo-people, from the time of his leaving the army, till he departed this life, it is unneceſſary to relate. The
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039133_0009_1013E901D51F9F90"/>
hiſtory is ſo recent, and his public virtues have ſo deeply impreſſed the mind of every American citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, that we may clearly ſee, that as "the LORD raiſed up a deliverer to the children of Iſrael." when in their trouble they cried unto him—ſo GOD hath done for us.</p>
            <p>Thus our ſubject opens into a very extenſive field for contemplation and practical improvement.—Whenever we look back upon the complex ſcene of the American revolution, and duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, from a ſtatement of facts, how it was brought about—what difficulties have been overcome—what obſtacles have been ſurmounted—till, from ſmall beginnings, the Republic is become great, even the moſt permanent and flouriſhing kingdom in the world—an aſylum of <hi>Liberty,</hi> both civil and religious—and all this ſo much owing, as a mean, to the ſkill, wiſdom, and political virtue of one man—we are filled with reverential wonder at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Heaven. And we may hence nationally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that this great event, in all its connections, was fixed in the divine mind <hi>long before</hi> it took place: "For known unto GOD are all his works, from the beginning of the world; even to him who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will."</p>
            <p>Hence alſo it appears evident, that our deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, from time to time, <hi>was, has been,</hi> and <hi>still is,</hi> of the LORD. He is the LORD of Hoſts: he doth his pleaſure among the children of men: he hath
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039133_0010_1013E9046518DF38"/>
made uſe of inſtruments, ſuch as he choſe; but has ever manifeſted himſelf wonderful in counſel. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery inſtance of our ſalvation, he hath wrought in ſuch a way and in ſuch a manner as might lead us <hi>to feel</hi> our entire dependance: for he hath raiſed up, and hath put down; ſhowing, that the race is not to the ſwiſt, nor the battle to the ſtrong—As he ſaved Iſrael of old, ſo hath he ſaved us. We may therefore adopt their ſong, and ſay, "If it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide; now may Iſrael ſay, if it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, then they had ſwallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us: then the waters had overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, the ſtream had gone over our ſoul: then the proud waters had gone over our ſoul. Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth."</p>
            <p>We further learn, that to attribute any thing more of our ſafety to any man, than as being one whom the Lord raiſed up, qualified and improved, as an inſtrument, would be to rob God of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is due to his name from us whom he hath delivered. There is a propriety in rendering to all their dues; "tribute, to whom tribute is due; cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, to whom cuſtom; fear, to whom fear; honor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom honor." God is the rightful Proprietor and the Supreme Governor of all things. Every good, of which any are the recepients, is from him,

and thankſgiving therefor is due to his name.—Creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by whom, as inſtruments, God at any time communicates his favours, are, for the ſame reaſon, to be conſidered as the miniſters of God; and as ſuch they are to be regarded and treated; and, even for their works ſake, to be reſpected.—But, we may not give that honour to the ſervant, which is due to his maſter; we may not aſcribe that to the creature, which is due to the great Creator, who is Lord of all—without being guilty of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege more criminal than can juſtly be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Let us take heed, therefore, while we render to man his due, that we alſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to God the things which are God's: For we may with propriety apply to ourſelves, what God ſaid upon this ſubject to his ancient Iſrael: "I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage. Thou ſhalt have no other gods before Me. Thou ſhalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeneſs of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou ſhalt not bow down thyſelf to them, nor ſerve them: For I the LORD thy God <hi>am a jealous God</hi> viſiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them that hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> me; and ſhewing mercy unto thouſands of them that love me and keep my commandments." And we may add the words of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:039133_0012_101466CBF4C9CB40"/>
the prophet, "I am the LORD, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another; neither my praiſe to graven images."</p>
            <p>In reference to the preſent occaſion, our ſubject may well penetrate every heart with a feeling ſenſe of this important truth, that as we have reaſon to mourn the loſs of a much beloved Citizen, who has been, in his day, uſeful beyond what we can fully deſcribe; ſo, in the ſame proportion, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obligation of gratitude to the Great Giver of every good, for the beſtowment of ſuch an one. In him centred all the rare endowments needful for the important ſtation to which he was aſſigned. Through the different ſtages of his public life, he has paſſed with a character unſullied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His virtues are known—His examples ſhine—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

When ſuch a friend, ſo beloved—when ſuch a citizen, ſo reſpected—when ſuch a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, ſo univerſally conſidered as the deliverer of his country, is removed, who can refrain from tears! When the beauty of America is fallen, ſhall not her daughters weep! What heart ſo inſenſible as not to ſhare in the general grief!—His name will live in the memory of every American, ſo long as they ſhall reliſh the ſweets of Liberty—or rather than ſubmit to ſervitude, they ſhall chuſe to be free.—To what other man were we ever ſo much indebted
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039133_0013_1013E90E3AB59A20"/>
for our independent eſtabliſhment, political peace, and civil privileges, as we are to him? Yet while, as worthy of our attention and imitation, we call to mind the virtues, the public ſervices, and the unſhaken patriotiſm, of the deceaſed, and pay theſe grateful reſpects to his memory, we ought carefully to bear this in mind, that to us he was one of the gifts of Heaven, raiſed up for thoſe important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes which were effected by him. Let us never forget the goodneſs of God, in his benefits beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our land. And to expreſs ſuitable feelings of heart under this bereaving providence, we may adopt the words of Job in his affliction, "the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; bleſſed be the name of the Lord."</p>
            <p>Moreover, our political parent, deceaſed, has left us in the full poſſeſſion of the moſt valuable Legacy, which the great Parent of all bleſſings did, by him, as an inſtrument, bequeath to us—even an eſtabliſhed <hi>Independence</hi> among the nations, and a permanent and well organized <hi>Government,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we enjoy all the natural immunities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to a free people. In conformity to mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral obligation—in imitation of thoſe virtues, by the medium of which theſe public rights were procured—and influenced by the animating proſpect of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture political happineſs—let us exert ourſelves, in our ſeveral characters, to maintain our rank in the ſcale of nations, to ſupport our conſtitutional Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039133_0014_1013E90FCD890EB0"/>
and thereby preſerve our privileges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate, that we may leave them a rich inheritance for our poſterity.</p>
            <p>And now, while we thus decorate the tomb of our much reſpected friend, with laurels of reſpect, wet with tears, and raiſe monuments to his memory as our deliverer, we ſhould take heed leſt we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the divine favours received by the hand of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and overlook that tribute of reſpect due to them as having deſerved well of their country, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of whom, while contending in the field of battle for the cauſe of Liberty and Religion, met an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death. Many, in every rank of citizens, have done worthily; and even the private ſoldier, who is virtuous and valiant, is entitled to honour. In our ſtruggle to defend our privileges, the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired our <hi>Senators</hi> with wiſdom, our <hi>Officers</hi> with ſkill, and our <hi>Armies</hi> with courage; but ſent ſaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into the hearts of our enemies. Therefore our ſalvation was of the Lord, in ways myſterious and unexpected—and to his name be the glory.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now only obſerve further, that as the Lord has been our refuge, our ſtrength, and our glory, ſo there is every encouragement, in a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, penitent manner, ſtill to make him our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. To whom ſhall we go, but unto the Lord? With him is counſel and ſtrength. Praiſe is due to his name, that we have ſo many worthy charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now active on the ſtage of life; and in partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular,

that our Confederate Chair of State is filled with one on whom reſts the ſpirit of Elijah—and that our Government is ſo wiſely adminiſtered by men of our own chuſing, but of God's providing.</p>
            <p>We ought, therefore, ever to implore the Moſt High, who is the Father of lights, that he would graciouſly give us <hi>men of integrity,</hi> to fill every pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſtation, and endow them with wiſdom to diſcern both time and judgment: ſo ſhall we be that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py people, whoſe God is the LORD.</p>
