         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

we might not think hardly, cenſoriouſly or injuriouſly of each other, and might live in tolerable good Peace and Charity one with another. But this Man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſet, and keep us ſtill at a variance, &amp; to blow up the Fire of Contention and Uncharitableneſs, and all forſooth, under the Pretenſe of <hi>doing Juſtice!</hi> tho you will find by what follows, that his <hi>Remarks</hi> are in Truth one continued Piece of <hi>Injuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to my ſelf, I regard not his Reproaches: Let him rail and try to expoſe and vilifie me as much as he pleaſes; his Wrath is impotent, and cannot hurt me: I do heartily forgive him, and pray God give him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Forgiveneſs!—and as to his reproachful and abuſive Treatment of the Church, I will only ſay, <hi>the Lord rebuke thee.</hi> I aſſure you that as I am not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, on ſo ſerious a Subject, to be either angry or merry; ſo I ſhall not go into ſuch a Method in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Cauſe: <hi>I have not ſo lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

little of the Gentleman, or the Chriſtian; that he ſhould betray ſo much ill Breeding, as well as ill Temper, as he does by ſo much baſe Language, and ſuch odious Inſinuations; However, <hi>The Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of GOD,</hi> and I doubt not but He will over-rule all this wrathful Treatment of us in ſuch a manner as to make it turn to our Advantage; as it is, on the other hand a great Diſgrace to your Cauſe, that it ſhould be defended in ſuch a ſcurrilous manner, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that moſt of the ſober, ſerious &amp; thinking Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among your ſelves have often declared themſelves aſhamed of it, and even your Miniſters will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to offer a Syllable in defence of it.</p>
            <p>It is indeed unaccountable to many conſiderate and moderate-ſpirited People of both Perſuaſions, what can be the Occaſion of it, that this Man, and ſome others like him, ſhould diſcover ſuch a bitter Spirit againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Country, and raiſe ſuch an hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>However, to antidote you againſt coming to the Church, which is ſolemnly dedicated to the Worſhip of GOD, he contemptuouſly and impiouſly calls it <hi>a little Cage under the Hill:</hi> — Much like a Gentleman! — And like a Chriſtian! — This I ſuppoſe he takes to be very pretty, thus to ſport himſelf with ſacred things.

He ſets down the Beginning of a Sentence, and leaves out what ſhould explain it:— What can this be, if it be not a wilful deſign to delude you? I will give the whole Sentence that you may ſee what the Truth of the Caſe is. — <hi>Brethren there was in the primitive Church a Godly Diſcipline that at the beginning of Lent ſuch Perſons as ſtood convicted of notorious Sin were put to open Penance.</hi>— This particular Inſtance of ancient Diſcipline, that notorious Offenders ſhould do open Penance <hi>on the firſt of Lent,</hi> we own we have not, and wiſh it reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: But is this to own we have no Godly Diſcipline at all, becauſe we don't uſe this good ancient Cuſtom?

If open Penance is not done <hi>on the firſt of Lent,</hi> as it was in the ancient Church, it does not follow that it is never done at all: And if he had not been reſolved to blacken us at any rate, right or wrong, and at the expence of both Truth and Juſtice, he would not have concealed the expreſs Order of the Church at the beginning of our Communion Office, where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is ſtrictly required <hi>to forbid any open and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious evil-liver, preſuming to come to the Lord's Table, till he openly declare himſelf to have truly repented and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his naughty Life,</hi> &amp;c. And what this open Penance is, you may ſee in the <hi>Preſent State of Great-Britain, p.</hi> 190. <hi>The Delinquent is to ſtand in the Church-Porch, on ſome Sunday bearhead and barefoot, bewailing himſelf, and begging every one that paſſes by, to pray for him; then to enter the Church, and in the middle of the Church he is

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:003784_0016_10025AB4AD5E97F0"/>He falſly pretends becauſe I mentioned <hi>Delaune</hi>'s Name but once, <hi>that this is all you bear of</hi> Delaune's <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, when I pretended to anſwer the moſt material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in that Book:</hi> Now as to this I ſtill ſay, that I anſwered the moſt material Objections in his Book, tho' I mentioned his Name but once: And where I did mention his Name, I anſwered the main Objection he has, and indeed that which runs thro the whole Book, <hi>weak</hi> as it is, as this Man owns, viz. that <hi>of our ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing with Popery,</hi> and ſhewed that it concludes as ſtrongly againſt you as againſt us.</p>
            <p>In the next three Pages you have a long harrangue about <hi>Perſecution.</hi> — To which I have theſe things to ſay. — In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, That what he calls Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, I ſtill maintain, was the doings of the State, and not of the Church; and this is as evident as it is that they are intirely diſtinct Governments: — Do any of the Churches Laws threaten Fines, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Death to thoſe that break them? No: How then can ſhe be charged with inflicting them? — Why he ſays, becauſe ſome of the Eccleſiaſtics were of the Legiſlature: — Well, be that as it will, this don't prove that they either made thoſe Laws, or executed them, eſpecially as Eccleſiaſtics: — But ſuppoſe they did: I don't pretend to ſay, there never was a Churchman of a perſecuting Spirit: — If there have been ſuch, they muſt anſwer for it: I am not concerned to defend Them, but the Church: And I challenge him to ſhew one Principle or Tenet of the Church that implies or juſtifies Perſecution; for the Church is the ſame now there is no Perſecution as when there was, and yet the Divine Right of Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Epiſcopacy ſtill is, as it always was, a Doctrine of our Church.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither did the civil Government of <hi>England,</hi> except in Popiſh Times, <hi>overſhed a crop of any

Man</hi>'s <hi>Blood on account of Religion,</hi> which was the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion I uſed. — Nor do I, as he ſays, <hi>repreſent the Presbyterians as ſeditious Incendiaries,</hi> unleſs he will own they were thoſe that were guilty of ſeditious Practices under a pretenſe of Zeal for Religion. — Indeed moſt of the bitter things he inſtances in, were what the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters ſuffered in the latter part of King <hi>Charles</hi> II's Reign and under King <hi>James</hi> II. when it was very well known, that not the Church but Popery was at the bottom, and the Church at laſt was Perſecuted as well as the Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>I tell you in my Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 7. that you are moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in talking of Perſecution now, when you have almoſt 50 years enjoyed an uninterrupted Toleration. — To this he ſays, <hi>he is ſorry I can't reckon back as far as</hi> 1688: Why really I fancy if he could reckon ſo far back he would find it <hi>almoſt</hi> 50 years. And with what propriety could King <hi>James</hi> be ſaid to <hi>interrupt the Toleration,</hi> when he was the King that firſt granted it? and that the year before; and the Presbyterians were vaſtly laviſh of their Compliments in thanking him, tho' they knew it was deſigned for the ſake of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Popery.</p>
            <p>As to the Days of <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters were uppermoſt, tho' the <hi>Browniſts</hi> or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents <hi>were his greateſt Favourites,</hi> as he pleads, yet the Presbyterians were alſo ſupported by him in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Church: And tho' I believe they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally abhorred the Murther of the King, yet they barbarouſly deprived him of his Chaplains, and denyed him the Liberty of the Common-Prayer, and had a great hand in the management of thoſe Times when, as I ſay, <hi>the Church was ſuppreſſed, and her Clergy ſequeſtered, plundered and barbarouſly treated;</hi> and for this I appeal to Walker's <hi>Hiſtory of the Sufferings of our Church and Clergy</hi> in thoſe Times of Rebellion <hi>and Confuſion.</hi> — But I

See alſo <hi>Letters of Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration againſt</hi> Meldrum. — I do therefore ſtill ſay, that no Diſſenters of any Denomination can with any face of Modeſty object Perſecution againſt us, when they in their Turns have perſecuted us as much as ever they can pretend they were perſecuted: Tho' I do abhor and condemn it equally on both ſides, and wherever it is found.</p>
            <p>After he has pretended to ſet the Caſe of <hi>Scotland in a clear Light,</hi> (tho' I can ſee no Light in it,) he ſays
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003784_0019_10025ABCB57499D0"/>
boldly and roundly, that <hi>no part of Chriſt's myſtical Body over drank deeper of the Cup of Perſecution, than the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Church there did from the Hands of Proteſtant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</hi> What a prodigious Aſſertion is this? What can I make of it? I am loth to charge him with a deſign to ſay a notorious untruth, I had rather think him beſide himſelf, or groſsly ignorant, if I could any way help him out: Did he never read any thing of the ten bloody Perſecutions of the primitive Church? Or does he know nothing of the innumerable Butcheries of Proteſtants from the Tyranny of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Need I ſay how vaſtly more, even beyond Compariſon, they ſuffered in 4 years under Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign in <hi>England,</hi> than theſe People in the whole 28 years he ſpeaks of in <hi>Scotland?</hi> Nay I may appeal to <hi>Walker</hi>'s Hiſtory abovementioned, compared with Bp. <hi>Burnet,</hi> that the Church of <hi>England</hi> and her Clergy ſuffered, at leaſt as much in 12 years in the Time of the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: What does the Man mean in giving himſelf ſuch unaccountable Liberties? — I am not concerned to vindicate Arch-Biſhop <hi>Sharp;</hi> but with what face can he mention him, when he knows that he was barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly Murthered by Presbyterians? He ought rather in tenderneſs to his own Cauſe to be aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Memory of that bloody deed.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Lampoons,</hi> I diſlike them on both ſides: but with what Juſtice he or others can complain I cannot ſee, when he knows they begun with their <hi>Catholic Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> and their <hi>important Queſtions</hi> as he calls them: I will venture to tell you one of his <hi>very important Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> it was this; after a very falſe and odious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in a ſort of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rhymes, he asks, <q>Are theſe Chriſt's Church, pray, or ben't they the Devils.</q> Does he think ſuch Queſtions deſerve ſerious Anſwers? Or, if he does, can he or any mortal blame me; who (without returning Railing for Railing, or one Lampoon for

another,) have tho't it my Duty, ſeriouſly to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to vindicate the Church, in a Country where ſhe is ſo barbarouſly miſrepreſented and abuſed?</p>
            <p>We are now come to that point, Whether <hi>the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>Days were Presbyterians?</hi> Now I can produce living Teſtimony that ſuch things have been pretended, — However this he gives up, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that whoever ſaid ſo <hi>ought to be made aſhamed of it.</hi> — But yet he thinks they would <hi>have been for bringing the Reformation forward to Presbytery, if they had lived</hi> a little longer, <hi>p.</hi> 16. — No, no, they were not ſuch weak People, or ſo ignorant of the Scriptures or the State of the Primitive Church as to be likely after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to alter their Judgments, or think Presbytery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to Epiſcopacy: They knew what they did, and having the Civil Government with them in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they had opportunity to go on leiſurely, and to conſider things with Care and Accuracy, and to ſet down their foot very wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ily. — It has indeed been often pretended, meerly from ſome unguarded Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of private Men, that our firſt Reformers held E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy to be only <hi>Jure humano,</hi> i. e. of human Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: But with what Juſtice can this be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? When they deliberately and publickly declare in <hi>the Preface</hi> to <hi>the Ordination-Office,</hi> that, <q>It is evident to all Men, diligently reading Holy Scriptures and ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles Times there have been theſe Orders of Miniſters in Chriſt's Church, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, which were ever held in ſuch reverend Eſtimation, that no Man by his own private Authority, might preſume to execute them, except he were firſt tried, examined and approved, and with public Prayer and impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands admitted thereto</q>.</p>
            <p>I ſay, <hi>Thoſe holy Martyrs were the very Men that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled our Forms of Prayer.</hi> — In anſwer to this, He
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003784_0021_10025AC1AD21C988"/>
asks, <hi>What did our Church do for Forms before their Day?</hi> and would inſinuate, that before this they <hi>pray'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Book, and ſo in this Regard were Presbyterians, p.</hi> 16. What wretched quibbling and unfair deluſive dealing is this? when he and every body knows, that before their Days <hi>Popery</hi> was the eſtabliſhed Religion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> What they aimed at, and declared to be their Deſign, was to purge the Church of all Popiſh Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reſtore it as near as poſſible to the Primitive Model, as it ſtood before the Days of Popery; and the Forms they preſcribed were ſuch, and many of them the very ſame, as were uſed in the Church, within the <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> firſt Centuries, as Dr. <hi>Comber,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bingham</hi> plainly make appear: and for theſe their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and their ſtedfaſt adhering to them, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was that they burnt at the Stake, and not meerly <hi>for ſuch Things as we hold in common with you,</hi> as he inſinuates.</p>
            <p>He ſtill inſiſts upon it, that, <hi>Tho' we uſe the Service of the Church, we are no true Church-Men;</hi> and will have it that we are <hi>Arminians,</hi> and a deal of pains he takes upon this Point, <hi>pages</hi> 17, 20, 29. and ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>Tho' I hate the Name of that Dutch Presbyterian, yet I am a Man after his own Heart:</hi> To all which, I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Tho' I am none of his Diſciples, yet I don't hate him: Nay, I will own, that I have a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinion of this <hi>Dutch</hi> Presbyterian, than I have of ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Presbyterians, and don't deny but that we hold ſome Doctrines in common with him: Where he follows Chriſt and his Apoſtles, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to follow Him; but I am far from following him in every thing; and therefore it is unfair and unjuſt for him to endeavour to render me odious by calling me an <hi>Arminian.</hi> He would think me very unjuſt if I ſhould call him a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> becauſe he holds ſome Doctrines that <hi>Mahomet</hi> taught; and yet this he certainly does; for it is well known that the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003784_0022_10025AC34DB0F588"/>
Doctrine of abſolute Predeſtination which he holds, was one of the fundamental Principles of <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſm:</hi> But juſt ſo unfair is he in calling me an <hi>Arminian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas he ſays, <hi>you hold this Doctrine juſt as we do:</hi> This I deny; and leave it to any body to compare your Confeſſion, and his pretended Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it in <hi>p.</hi> 43, with our Article: You can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed conſiſtently own our Article, but we cannot conſiſtently own your Confeſſion, becauſe it peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily determines in this Controverſy, which ours does not, for there is not a Syllable in it of abſolute Reprobation, which is the grand Point that we ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And herein the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of our Church was very conſpicuous, in ſo treating of this Doctrine, as not to give Offence to Perſons of either Perſuaſion. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I appeal to Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, and Bp. <hi>Burnet</hi> on the 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> [and I here mention it once for all, that when I quote Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to ſave the Trouble of writing, if any Perſons want to be further ſatisfied, and deſire it I will lend them the Books I refer to] I ſay I appeal to thoſe Authors, that our firſt Reformers did not aim at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Senſe; but deſignedly went in the middle way of <hi>Eraſmus, Melancthon</hi> and the <hi>Ausburg</hi> or <hi>Lutheran</hi> Confeſſion: And thoſe who were rigid <hi>Calviniſt's</hi> afterwards were ſo ſenſible of this, that they were not contented with our Articles, and would have had the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles, (as they are called) eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, which ſtrongly expreſs the <hi>Calviniſtic</hi> Senſe: Now if our Articles, were full on that ſide, what need they have troubled themſelves to bring in any others? See eſpecially Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> who abundantly vindicates our Church from the Imputation, of <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi> I would obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:003784_0023_10025AC4D29FDA50"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That it is not a juſt and fair way to judge of the Senſe of the Church by any ſingle Phraſe or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion taken by it ſelf alone; (eſpecially ſince ſo accurate a way of Speaking and Writing on contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial Subjects had not then obtained in our Language, nor in thoſe Times, as it has ſince,) but the right way of aſcertaining the Churches Senſe, is to take the whole of it together, and compare the ſeveral Paſſages in the Articles, Liturgy and Homiles on a Subject one with another, which you may ſee done by Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in a multitude of Inſtances; I will mention two or three; Thus in the Prayers we uſe ſuch Expreſſions as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, <q>Almighty GOD who haſt compaſſion on all Men, and hateſt nothing that thou haſt made, and would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not the Death of the Sinner, but rather that he ſhould be converted and live</q>. And in the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> we teach, <q>That Chriſt hath redeemed us and all Mankind</q>. — And indeed the 17th Article explains it ſelf, if he had fairly given you the whole of it; for after what he recites, theſe Words follow, <q>Furthermore we muſt receive GOD's Promiſes in ſuch wiſe as they be generally ſet forth to us in Holy Scripture, and in our Doings, that Will of GOD is to be followed, which we have expreſsly declared to us in the Word of GOD</q>. Now in the Word of GOD it is expreſsly declared, that <hi>Chriſt died for all,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14. That <hi>he taſted Death for every Man,</hi> Heb. 2.9. That he <hi>bought</hi> or redeemed, even <hi>thoſe</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by <hi>denying him brought on themſelves ſwift De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1. And <hi>that GOD is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance and be ſaved,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. and 1 Tim. 2.4, 5, 6. I would ask now, how it can be ſuppoſed to be the Senſe of our Church; That Chriſt died only for here and there one, and that GOD hath abſolutely Decreed or Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the eternal Miſery and Deſtruction of all the reſt of Mankind: No, I am ſure if we take the Articles, Prayers and Homilies altogether, and candidly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret

one Paſſage by another, and by the general Tenor of the whole, we ſhall find nothing in them that can be juſtly interpreted to expreſs the <hi>Calviniſtic</hi> Doctrine of abſolute Predeſtination and Reprobation: And let the Articles be ſo underſtood, as in Candour and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice they ought, and there is not one of them, but I do heartily own and aſſent to. And beſides,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Who, I beſeech you, can be ſuppoſed ſo well to have underſtood the Churches Senſe in her Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as thoſe very Men that compoſed them? Now it is certain that they taught exactly as we do now, and that long before <hi>Arminius</hi> was heard of; I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſeveral of them, but for brevity, I will only quote a Paſſage out of each of thoſe three good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Archbp. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Bp. <hi>Latimer,</hi> and Bp. <hi>Hooper,</hi> which you may ſee in Bp. <hi>Fowler</hi>'s Diſcourſe on <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Liberty,</hi> and many more in Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi> Archbp. <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſays, that <q>Chriſt made a Sacrifice and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Body on the Croſs, which was a full Redemption, Satisfaction and Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World</q>. Which are alſo very near the ſame Words that our Church uſes in her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Service.</hi> Bp. <hi>Latimer</hi> ſays, that <q>Chriſt ſhed as much Blood for <hi>Judas</hi> as he did for <hi>Peter; Peter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it, and therefore was ſaved, <hi>Judas</hi> would not believe, and therefore was condemned; the fault being in him only and in no body elſe, &amp;c.</q>. And Bp <hi>Hooper</hi> ſays, <q>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> was no more excluded from the Promiſe of Chriſt than <hi>Peter; Eſau</hi> than <hi>Jacob,</hi> concerning which two Brethren in the Sentence g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> I obſerve, That according to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our Church, her Articles are to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the Scriptures, and not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by our Articles, or thoſe of any other Church; and for this I have the Authority of the Church her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who declares in <hi>Art.</hi> VI.

Now I cannot ſee but there is as good reaſon for diſtinguiſhing theſe different Services by different Habits, as the Clergy from the Layity, which he allows: And if it be proper to diſtinguiſh them, as he grants, and Government, for ſuch good Reaſons as I have given, hath appointed the proper habits, I ſtill ſay, it betrays not only littleneſs of Mind and narrowneſs of Soul, but alſo too much of a factious diſorderly Spirit, to diſobey it.</p>

what I can't underſtand: And I would ask, How then any Children have a Right to Baptiſm whoſe Parents did never profeſs the Chriſtian Faith: According to his Doctrine, no Children could be Baptized, but thoſe of Chriſtian Parents: This he has no proof for, nor any Reaſon does he produce, nor can any good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be given, why meerly the Parents Faith ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to Baptiſm, or the want of it forbid them: Not only <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children, but all <hi>that were born in his Houſe,</hi> nay, and <hi>bought with his Money, were Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, Gen.</hi> 17.12. Why then may not ſuch be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? — We of the Church hold, that it is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or good Hopes the Church has, that a Child will in all probability have a Chriſtian Education, which gives it a right to Baptiſm, and that it is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Covenant till they that undertake for its Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do in its Name anſwer its part of the Covenant; upon which occaſion the Miniſter in GOD's Name engages that he will fulfill his part, and affixes the Sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now ſince the Church looks on the Proſpect of a Chriſtian Education, as that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately intitles the Child to Baptiſm, therefore it is that ſhe inſiſts on a double Security for it: She knows that GOD and Nature have made it the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Duty to <hi>bring up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord;</hi> and therefore ſhe does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any expreſs Promiſe of them, but becauſe they may fail, ſhe inſiſts that they ſhould have others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake with them, as a further &amp; additional Security: And where is the evil of this?

And the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non he quotes which forbids Parents anſwering as God-fathers, is ſo far from <hi>declaring againſt this double Security,</hi> as he inſinuates, that it was ordered for this very End that there might be a double Security; ſince if the Parents, who are ſuppoſed to be engaged by Nature, were admitted to anſwer as Sponſors, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might be apt to think themſelves excuſed from any Obligation, and ſo it would at length be in the more danger of dwindling into an uſeleſs Ceremony.</p>

as ſignifying any thing beſides what the Words import. What needs then all this impertinent Clamour?</p>
            <p>In the next place, As to <hi>Holy Days,</hi> I ſhewed that they were wiſely appointed by the Church to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the ſeveral Steps which our glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer took in accompliſhing our Redemption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and reſted our Obligation to obſerve them, upon the ſame Foot as you hold your Obligation to obſerve your Faſts and Thanksgivings, <hi>viz.</hi> The Command of lawful Authority.— Now as to our Faſts &amp; Feaſts he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 27. <hi>It is no leſs than a bold invading of Chriſt's Royal Prerogative to appoint them;</hi> but does not ſo much as attempt to ſhew why it is not as much a <hi>bold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading</hi> of <hi>His Prerogative</hi> for you to appoint your Faſts and Thanksgivings:— This therefore I ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon, that with the ſame Breath that you juſtify yours, you juſtify ours, and he can't ſhew the leaſt difference:— for the ſame Temporal Bleſſings you faſt and give thanks on the account of, are to be prayed for and acknowledged on every Lord's Day, as well as the Spiritual Bleſſings we commemorate on our Feaſts and Faſts: So that the ſtrongeſt Reaſons are clearly on our ſide, as much ſtronger than yours, certainly, as Spiritual Bleſſings are greater than Temporal, the fruits of Chriſts coming into the World, than the fruits of the Earth. Indeed GOD commands us <hi>to keep Holy the Sabbath Day,</hi> which is now <hi>the firſt Day</hi> of the Week, to Pray and give Thanks for all Bleſſings Temporal and Spiritual; but it is not therefore unlawful for us to yield him our free-will Offerings, by appointing other Days to be kept Holy for ſome particular Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of either kind: This is what we are all agreed in; and why, I beſeech you, may not we appoint o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Days to be ſet apart for Public Worſhip, as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as you?

What was incumbent upon him, if he would have done any thing to the purpoſe, was in anſwer to my Challenge, to ſhew one Scripture Doctrine rejected, or one Divine Law ſet aſide, or any thing enjoyned as neceſſary in it ſelf which is not ſo, by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which were what the Phariſees were blamed for: But to this he makes no manner of Reply.</p>
            <p>And as lame is he in his Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 25. to my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that Objection from <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. where GOD gives that as a Reaſon of his Diſpleaſure with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for their <hi>building high Places and worſhipping Idols,</hi> that <hi>he commanded them not:</hi> I told you the meaning
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003784_0036_10025AE4A8D37250"/>
of it was that he had <hi>forbidden them</hi> — To this he only Anſwers, <hi>my Gloſs was very unjuſt,</hi> without ſhewing wherein. — Now as to this, I appeal to all that know what is meant by that Figure called <hi>Meioſis,</hi> whither this Expreſſion be any thing elſe: <hi>I commanded them not,</hi> i e. So far from this, that <hi>I ſtrictly forbad them;</hi> for every Body knows that what he here complains of, he had peremptorily forbidden them: So that what he calls a moral Reaſon, is only a figurative Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, — for, that it could not, Literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, be any Reaſon at all, I ſhall ſhew preſently, becauſe, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Where no law is there is no Tranſgreſſion:</hi> where <hi>no law</hi> forbids a thing, <hi>there is no tranſgreſſion</hi> in doing it.</p>
            <p>Nor has he ſo much as attempted one Syllable of Reply to the Anſwer I gave to your Objection about <hi>offending weak Brethren.</hi>— And he owns you are in an Error in enjoyning your <hi>Church Covenant and Relations;</hi> and only ſays, <hi>Your Errors will not leſſen our Guilt, p.</hi> 28. So that even according to Him, you are as guilty of unwarrantable Impoſitions as we, and do as ready <hi>teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men;</hi> tho' this I have proved the Church does not, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Saviour's meaning. — Thus this great Champion who pretends to defend your Cauſe, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably leaves you in the lurch, where you moſt wanted — his help.</p>
            <p>And now I proceed to the <hi>ſecond Head</hi> I mentioned, viz upon what foot it is that we hold our ſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obſerve the Appointments of our Church. And upon this head, he ſays, <hi>If it were to ſave a Million of Souls, we muſt not let go the leaſt trifling Ceremony. p.</hi> 20. — To which I anſwer, — This Sophiſtry is equally levelled againſt all Government, and all Churches. In your Churches, no body ſhall be admitted without ſubmitting to your Church Covenant, and in ſome
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003784_0037_10025AE722B62F48"/>
Places, without a Relation, and Vote of the Brethren, &amp;c. — Nay, I have known People to go out of the World in the bitterneſs of their Souls, for want of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, which were refuſed them by the Miniſters, meerly becauſe it was not the Cuſtom in thoſe Places where they lived, to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments in private Houſes, tho' on the moſt urgent Occaſions: Which Practices among you, are vaſtly more unreaſonable than any thing can be pretended in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nay, this Sophiſtry of his, intirely ſubverts his own dear <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which aſſerts, and indeed very juſtly; Art. XX. that <q>They that under the Pretenſe of Liberty, oppoſe any lawful Power, or the lawful Exerciſe of it, [ſuch as is interpoſing in matters indifferent] whither Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, reſiſt the Ordinance of GOD, and may be proceeded againſt by the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church, and by the Civil Magiſtrate.</q> And indeed there never was, or can be a Church or Government in the World, but did, and muſt interpoſe in ſome things, for Public Order, that were <hi>antecedently</hi> matters of indifferency, which as I ſaid, are what we mean by Ceremonies. — Now I have proved that there are no Ceremonies in our Church, the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with which, could do the leaſt Damage to the Souls of Men; and therefore if they don't comply with them, it is not Government, Civil or Sacred that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them, but they exclude themſelves by refuſing to obſerve the Laws of Chriſt, which require obedience to Government in all things not contrary to His Laws: And after all he has declaimed, it ſtill remains to be proved, that the Church requires any thing inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the Goſpel, or forbids what that requires.</p>
            <p>He has got indeed a fine pretenſe for Diſobedience, <hi>p.</hi> 26. where he quotes our Saviour's ſaying, Matth. 28.20. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve whatſoever I have commanded you;</hi> upon which he ſays, <hi>It is a rule in Divinity, that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003784_0038_10025AE8A6AD1F80"/>
where a Duty is enjoyned, the contrary Sin is forbidden.</hi> This I allow to be a good Rule, and own, that hence it follows that we may not teach any thing for a neceſſary Doctrine of Chriſt, which he hath not taught and commanded us to teach as ſuch. — But does it hence follow, that Government may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, for Public Order, ſome things which are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their own Nature to be indifferent, and only required for external Order and Decency? No ſuch matter: So far from this, that Chriſt requires <hi>we ſhould not only render to GOD the things that are his,</hi> but alſo <hi>to</hi> Caeſar, the Civil Magiſtrate, <hi>the things that are his,</hi> Mat. 22.21. And with reſpect to Eccleſiaſtical Rulers; (ſuch he means by <hi>thoſe that ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>Seat,</hi>) he ſays, <hi>All whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do,</hi> Mat. 23.2. So that when he requires obedience to lawful Authority in Church and State, by this <hi>Rule of Divinity,</hi> the contrary Vice of Diſobedience is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. This Rule therefore concludes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, unleſs he will ſay that our Saviour's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he commands us to obey him, is, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to obey even lawful Government in things not forbidden by him: This would be fine Divinity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What can this mean, but that it is utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to obey humane Authority, even where Chriſt hath not interpoſed? And what can this tend to, but to demoliſh all Government, not only in Church and State, but even in Families alſo? And what is this, but to make our bleſſed Saviour the Patron of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Diſorder and Confuſion?</p>
            <p>Now that this is the Tendency of this Man's Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, is evident from this, that he ſays, Chriſt does, by Command limit us, not only <hi>to that all that,</hi> but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>only to that which he has commanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And now, pray look at home, and ſee what will come of your own Cauſe: And here I will uſe the Words of Mr. <hi>Hart,</hi> in his <hi>Bulwark Stormed,</hi> which is a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat

            <p>I do ſtill <hi>venture to ſay,</hi> that we may lawfully do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever GOD hath not forbidden, however ſo <hi>great</hi> a <hi>venture</hi> he would repreſent it, <hi>p.</hi> 25. and would ask him ſeriouſly, where is the great venture of it: All Divines admit that there are three kinds of Actions, viz <hi>Good, Evil</hi> &amp; <hi>Indifferent,</hi> i. e. ſuch as GOD hath <hi>commanded</hi> or <hi>forbidden,</hi> or ſuch as he hath <hi>neither</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nor forbidden, and theſe laſt mentioned are
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003784_0041_10025AF0870E7908"/>
called <hi>Indifferent:</hi> theſe therefore may be done or left undone at our Pleaſure; for according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule before-mentioned, Rom. 4.15. <hi>Where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion. Where there is no Law</hi> that commands or forbids an Action, <hi>there is no Trangreſſion</hi> in doing or omitting it; for it being the Deſign of GOD's Laws to reſtrain our natural Liberty in ſuch Inſtances as he knows it will be for our Good to be confined to do or avoid, and wherein he requires us to teſtifie our Duty, and Obedience to him; it is plain. That in all other Inſtances, he leaves us to the Exerciſe of our natural Liberty. This ſeems to me a clear Caſe, but it is as clear, that Government both in Church and State, is God's own Ordinance, and he has made it a neceſſary Duty to us to obey it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Sin to diſobey it: it muſt therefore according to his Will, be in the Power of Government alſo, in Subordination to him, to reſtrain our Liberty in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Inſtances — And laſtly, It is no leſs evident, that thoſe Actions, which in regard to the Commands of God are indifferent, are the only proper Objects of human Authority, <hi>i. e.</hi> wherein our Governours may properly, &amp; Lawfully interpoſe, to command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid: for if they were to command or forbid only what GOD hath commanded or forbidden, our Obedience would not have their Authority or Commands for it's Object, but GOD's; and then thoſe Laws of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which commands us to <hi>ſubmit to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13 and <hi>to obey them that have the Rule over us,</hi> Heb 13.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Obedience has ever a Relation to Commands or Prohibitions, and theſe muſt be the Commands or Prohibitions of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that Commands or Forbids; and the Apoſtles here ſpeak of lawful Authority, which they muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe to have a power of interpoſing by their Authority where GOD hath not interpoſed by His.</p>

And upon this foot there would be no end of Scruples and Indulgences, Diviſions and Subdiviſions, and no Public Peace and Order could be provided for. — No, the Truth and the Right of the Caſe is, if I would do juſtice both to my Self and the Public under my Scruples, I ſhould ſet what is clear in ballance againſt what is doubtful, and this will determine what Choice I ought to make: Thus I would fairly ſtate the Caſe, <hi>I doubt,</hi> (and therefore it is ſuppoſed I am not <hi>clear</hi> in it,) whether I may lawfully comply with ſuch a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony: But it is clear on the other hand, if I don't ſubmit to what is eſtabliſhed, I ſhall deſtroy the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Peace, and enervate Government: therefore I can no longer, properly Speaking, make a doubt of it. — Whether I ſhould comply. — So that tho' in a Caſe not decided by Authority, if I ſhould doubt, I ought to abſtain by this Rule of the Apoſtle, yet if lawful Authority has interpoſed, the Caſe is altered, and it is my Duty to reſign my Doubt, which implies ſome <hi>uncertainty,</hi> to the public Senſe, to which I ought to pay a great defference, and to the good of the whole, which ſhould be ever held ſacred, and ought to be vaſtly dear to me, and which on the other hand, by my inſiſting on my Scruple, will certainly be infringed. — But for a more full and compleat So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this, and indeed all other Caſes of this kind, I refer to Dr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have ever ſaid, that I charitably believe, you gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mean well, and endeavour to do your Duty, and pleaſe GOD in the Way you are in according to what Light you have, nor have I ever taken upon me to judge you as inſincere, but only to judge for my Self, and act for my Self, according to the beſt of my Light and Ability. I muſt indeed own, that as I am fully perſuaded upon the ſtricteſt Examination I can make, and with a moſt ſolicitous Concern not to be deceived my Self nor impoſe upon others, that I am in the Right in the Principles I have embraced, and the Choice I have made, ſo I am very deſirous others ſhould think with me, which is what ought and will be the Caſe with every one that loves his Neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But I can ſincerely ſay, I never have uſed, nor do I deſire to uſe, any other Methods for influencing others to think with me, than friendly, calm and diſpaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Reaſoning, heartily willing that every one ſhould think for himſelf, and judge for himſelf, as I have done; and heartily endeavour that every thing I ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, either to my ſelf or others, ſhould turn to, and iſſue in ſome good Practical Purpoſe, which may tend to make us wiſer and better; more virtuous and holy here, and happy hereafter: And ſure I am, neither Truth nor Right can ever much ſuffer under ſuch a Management, nor can I think, that any thing can by this Means be promoted that tends to damnifie the moral or political, the civil or religious, the temporal or eternal Intereſts of Mankind; all which are certainly, at leaſt as well, provided for in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as any other Church this Day upon the face of the Earth. — And I muſt do my ſelf that Juſtice, as to ſay, that I ſhould even abhor my ſelf, if I had the leaſt Suſpicion that I lived to any miſchievous Purpoſes, or that any thing I ſaid or did, had any tendency to the real Damage of my dear Country; and that I have as hearty a good Will to it, and as ſolicitous a Concern

and <hi>Crete,</hi> and in the Perſons of <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> confirmed by the univerſal Facts of the Primitive Church: To all which, as I have ſaid, he makes no Reply; and for a further Vindication of the Epiſcopal Government, I refer you to my Letters above-mentioned, printed with the <hi>Elutherius Enervatus,</hi> and the other Anſwer to the <hi>Divine Right of Presbyterian Ordination,</hi> but eſpecially to Bp <hi>Potter</hi> on Church Government, and <hi>the Original Draught of the Primitive Church,</hi> and to ſeveral others that were never attempted to be anſwered.— Under this head I told you, that you have utterly forſaken the Scripture Rule, in not Ordaining Deacons, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. and in the Layity's Ordaining Miniſters, for which you have no Scripture Rule or Example, but the contrary: This indeed you are generally aſham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. My <hi>next</hi> Objection was, that the Separation was founded upon an <hi>unwarrantable Diſobedience</hi> to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both in Church and State, contrary to thoſe Tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And notwithſtanding he had mentioned it before, <hi>p.</hi> 9. he falſly repreſents us as <hi>denying to Read ſome of the Canon,</hi> and <hi>impoſing ſome of the Apocrypha.</hi>— Now, I know his meaning is, that we don't read ſome part of the Canon for publick Leſſons: But why muſt this be abuſively repreſented to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the vulgar, as tho' we forbid ſome part of the Scriptures to be read at all. But as to reading them in Public, it is true we are not required by the Church, (nor is there any Reaſon, why we ſhould) to read all the Parts of Scripture in the Time of Publick Worſhip; and I believe any Body would think it very abuſive to fault any Church for not reading many parts of it, ſuch as hard Names of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Genealogies, and very obſcure Propheſies, and the like: Such Parts of it, tho' on many Occaſions, they are very uſeful, yet it is no diſrepect to them to ſay that they are leſs edifying to the common People, than the Books of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus.</hi>— But as to the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> it is only ſome part of it that is to be read, and we are not required to read one Syllable of it on the Lord's-Day, tho' if we were, it would be much more edifying than any thing this great Preacher could offer. — Now I will put it to your own Conſciences, do you really think that ſuch Reaſons as theſe will juſtify a Separation from the Church Eſtabliſhed in our Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they don't read hard Names and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Propheſies in Publick on the Lord's Day, and becauſe they read ſome excellent parts of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,</hi> (tho' not as canonical Scripture,) on Week-Days?</p>

Why, to ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> to uſe this Form which our Lord taught his Diſciples. Very well, you ſee he allows it to be an expreſs Command to uſe it; but then, what a ſtrange Expreſſion is this; <hi>unleſs it be unlawful to obey an expreſs Command, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to uſe it:</hi> What? Is it only <hi>barely lawful to obey an expreſs Command?</hi> Certainly I ſhould have tho't it a great Duty <hi>to obey an expreſs Command of Chriſt:</hi> And yet he, (ſtrangely inconſiſtent with himſelf,) goes to prove that we may lawfully break it; for he pleads that we are not tied by it to the <hi>Words,</hi> but the <hi>Things;</hi> as if to pray <hi>after this Manner</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. which might more properly be rendered, to <hi>pray thus,</hi> did not relate to the <hi>Words</hi> as well as the <hi>Things,</hi> and as if Chriſt did not mean the ſame here, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. where he expreſsly Commands his Diſciples to ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. But what need I trouble my ſelf to Anſwer what he ſays here, and his long String of quibbling impertinent Queſtions above, when you ſee he has himſelf effectually anſwered, all he has, or can ſay; for, pray, what buſineſs have we to go to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning about it, when we have, as he owns, a plain and expreſs Command before us? I ſhould willingly Anſwer his Queſtions as fairly as he pleaſes, if they were not very unfair ones, and if he had not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwered them himſelf: But indeed it would be beneath a fair well-meaning Man to ask ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Queſtions about preciſe <hi>Words, Syllables</hi> and <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> The reſult of his Queries is, that if we muſt uſe the Lord's Prayer at all, we muſt uſe it <hi>in the very Language wherein Chriſt delivered it,</hi> and with as good Reaſon he might have ſaid, if we muſt read the Bible at all, we muſt read it in the Original. — Truly, I ſhould chuſe to uſe it in the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> if the People underſtood thoſe Languages, but as they don't, I wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You have therefore no other way in this Caſe, but, as I ſaid, (like the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) to have a kind of implicit Faith in your Miniſter.— This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you might have, if it were as he tells you, <hi>p.</hi> 39. that ſuch as he, depend upon the Spirit, to <hi>teach them how and what to pray, and bring Words to their Minds.</hi> This Quakeriſh Talk I anſwered in my Letter, where I told you, if this were the meaning of <hi>praying by the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.15. you muſt ſing <hi>extempore</hi> as well as pray <hi>extempore.</hi>— When therefore we ſee theſe Men that are ſo familiar with the Spirit, ſing New Pſalms <hi>extempore;</hi> —When they make no uſe of Prayer-Books to learn the Art of praying, as I know they do; when there are no fooliſh, ſenſeleſs and very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Expreſſions in their Prayers; when no wicked Man, who we know has not the Spirit of Chriſt, can pray fluently; then perhaps we may begin to think that the Spirit <hi>brings to their Minds</hi> what to ſay next upon all Occaſions: But till we ſee theſe things, we can never believe that the Spirit has ſo much to do in their Prayers as they would perſwade us: — Not but that we own we can't pray acceptably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of GOD inſpiring us with ſuch holy Tempers, Diſpoſitions, Affections and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:003784_0060_10025B1C5227F300"/>
Reſolutions as become that holy Duty; but further than theſe, we can ſee no ſenſe in this Notion of praying by the Spirit he pleads for. — Upon the whole, it is really a melancholy thing to hear you forever talking of pure Worſhip, and againſt the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, when at the ſame time, your Worſhip is little elſe but Man's Invention: For pray conſider, what have you in your Service, but an extempore Prayer and a Sermon, and theſe you can't but ſee, are your Miniſters Invention, unleſs you will ſay, as ſome Quakers do, that they are as much the Word of GOD as the Bible: You ſing, it is true, two or three Verſes of the Pſalms, but they are turned into Metre, and this together with the Tunes you uſe, are but Humane Inventions, and of late date too: And one would think you don't ſing as an Act of Worſhip, for then, ſure you would ſtand up: The Bleſſing, it is true, is taken from Scripture, but then you have generally ſomething added to it to mend it. This, my Brethren, is your pure Worſhip, for which you have turned out ſeveral Divine Appointments, ſuch as the Lord's Prayer, reading the Scripture, the People's bearing a part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For your further Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, read, Bp. <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Inventions of Men in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Another Thing I told you wherein you appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me to vary from the Scripture-way of Worſhip, is, <hi>That the People do not bear a part in your publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> And here he ſays, <hi>We do allow them all that the Word of God, and the Examples therein, allow them. p.</hi> 39. Now would to God this were true, for we deſire no more: But alas! What can be more contrary to Truth? for any Man, with but half an Eye, may ſee that the Word of GOD and the Examples therein, allow and require the People to join their Voices in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Public Prayers and Praiſes: Thus, beſides the Texts I mentioned before, ſee <hi>Judges</hi> 21.2. <hi>The
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:003784_0061_10025B21217C7AB0"/>
People came to the Houſe of God, and lift up their Voices, and wept ſore, and ſaid, O Lord God of Iſrael, why is this come to paſs in Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> And 2 Chron. 7.2. <hi>The People bowed themſelves with their Faces to the Ground upon the Pavement, and worſhipped and praiſed the Lord, ſaying, He is Good, for his Mercy endureth forever.</hi>— Nehem. 8.6. <hi>And Ezra bleſſed the Lord, the great God, and all the People anſwered and ſaid,</hi> Amen, Amen, <hi>with lifting up their Hands and they bowed their Heads and worſhipped the Lord, with their Faces towards the Ground.</hi> Yea, There is an expreſs Command for it, in Pſal. 106.48. <hi>Let all the People ſay,</hi> Amen. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the New-Teſtament, it is plain from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. That the <hi>unlearned</hi> had a <hi>vocal</hi> part aſſigned them in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies, ſo from <hi>Rev</hi> 19, 6. To which he made no Reply, and yet had the Courage to charge this Scripture Way of Worſhip with Confuſion.</p>
            <p>But let us take a view of his Comment on two Texts that I mentioned to prove this Point; one was <hi>Acts</hi> 4.24. <hi>They lift up their Voice with one accord, and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. Now, ſays he, it is evident <hi>this was a ſinging Voice:</hi> Sure he is a bold Man, thus to contradict the Holy Ghoſt: The Spirit of GOD ſays, <hi>they ſaid</hi> this Prayer: It is no ſuch thing, ſays <hi>J. G.</hi> they <hi>ſung</hi> it: Well, Let us ſee how he proves it? Why, ſays he, <hi>It is evident that part of this Prayer was part of the ſecond Pſalm:</hi> Here now is Demonſtration! Not a Word more to be ſaid! for you know it is impoſſible to uſe one Sentence out of the Pſalms without Singing. Had this Man ever been at Church, he would have ſeen this Argument conſuted for there we uſe whole Pſalms together without Singing: and I pray does he never uſe a Sentence taken out of the Pſalms in Prayer? and does he always ſing his Prayers? — I can't leave this terrible Argument without taking Notice of a flat Contradiction: He had ſaid but the Page before, <hi>That the Apoſtles did not uſe</hi> either <hi>David</hi>'s, or
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:003784_0062_10025B22A814D958"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi>'s or <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Prayers, yet here in the very next Page he tells us, that <hi>part of</hi> this Prayer which the Apoſtles uſed was <hi>the expreſs Words of the ſecond Pſalm,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> compoſed. This verifies the Proverb, <hi>They that tell two Stories, need have a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:</hi> But it is no wonder a Man ſhould contradict himſelf that makes bold to contradict his Maker; nor is it any wonder that a Man ſhould plead for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeditated Prayers, that Writes without any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation or Conſideration.</p>
            <p>He next falls upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. where we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>with one Mind, and one Mouth to glorify our heavenly Father,</hi>— And ſays he, <hi>this one Morth is the Miniſters Mouth, p.</hi> 40. — Very fine! And why not the <hi>one Mind</hi> the Miniſters Mind too? and then the People have nothing at all to do, and may e'en go to Sleep, or go home and leave the Miniſter to pray for them, for he can do it, according to Mr. <hi>J. G</hi>'s ſenſe, <hi>with one Mind and one Mouth,</hi> as well without them as with them: Now we take it, that as the <hi>one Mind</hi> ſignifies the Minds of all the Congregation, united in thinking the ſame thing, ſo the <hi>one Mouth</hi> means the Mouths of all the Congregation, as it were with <hi>one Voice</hi> ſaying the ſame thing. — He then propunds two or three childiſh Queſtions: One is, <hi>Why don't your People joyn in reading the Leſſons,</hi> i. e. Chapters, <hi>as well as the Pſalms?</hi> I anſwer, becauſe when other Parts of the Scripture are read, GOD is therein ſpeaking to the People, and therefore it is proper for the Miniſter alone to read it, as <hi>Ezra</hi> did, in <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.3. And it was but a little before he had ſaid, that in Scripture-times, <hi>One read</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, and all the People did not read with an audible Voice, in a moſt confuſed manner,</hi> as if we did ſo: Whereas we in this conform exactly to the Scripture Pattern: But now he has forgot himſelf, and asks why don't the People read a part of the Leſſons? — But on
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003784_0063_10025B2442627170"/>
the other hand, the Pſalms are Prayers and Praiſes, or Addreſſes to GOD, and therefore all our People joyn in ſaying and ſinging them. — He next asks, <hi>By what Rule do Women thus ſpeak in the Church?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, pray by what Rule do Women ſing in your Meetings? There is as good warrant for one as the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>praying and propheſying,</hi> or ſinging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> juſtly interprets it. Tho' the Apoſtle forbad them <hi>to teach or uſurp Authority over the Man,</hi> 1. Tim. 2 12. Yet he never forbad them to joyn with the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in praying and praiſing GOD. Now I hope theſe Difficulties <hi>are removed,</hi> and our Worſhip <hi>wholly cleared from Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I am on this head of the Peoples part in Public Worſhip, I will vindicate what I alledged to prove it their Duty to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> vocally: I produced ſeveral Texts out of both the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are as full to the purpoſe as Words can be, ſome of which I mentioned above. Now obſerve how eaſily he turns them off: —He ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>My multiplied Quotations prove no more than that the People ſhould ſay</hi> Amen <hi>privately.</hi> I confeſs, I am much at a loſs to know what he means by ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> privately, unleſs it be to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> ſilently, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſpeak and at the ſame time ſay nothing at all: This is quite as good as the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſilent Meetings, which they ſay are moſt edifying. But I intreat you to conſider, That to aſſent to a Public Prayer in my Heart is one thing, and openly to teſtifie this Aſſent by ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> is another, and that GOD requires the latter as well as the former. — It is a dangerous thing to make <hi>a Noſe of Wax</hi> of the Scripture, as he does on this, and many other Subjects; thus when GOD requires us to <hi>confeſs with the Mouth,</hi> as well as to <hi>believe with the Heart,</hi> Rom. 10.9, 10. to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> as well as to <hi>think</hi> it, for a poor ſilly Mortal to ſtart up and ſay, <hi>it is Confuſion,</hi> and it is more decent to ſay
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:003784_0064_10025B2685D7C9E0"/>
it <hi>privately,</hi> &amp;c. How intolerably preſuming is this? If this Method will do, the <hi>Quakers</hi> muſt never be condemned for rejecting outward Baptiſm, and the outward Lord's Supper, ſo long as they can ſay they receive them inwardly. — Laſtly, Whereas he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents us here as ſaying <hi>Amen twenty or thirty Times in reading the ſame Prayers.</hi> — I pray what People do ſo? I am ſure the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſay <hi>Amen</hi> but once to one Prayer. — To uſe his own Words, <hi>How hateful are ſuch ſlanderous Inſinuation?</hi> — Upon the whole, I can't but think, Brethren, you had but a hard Bargain of it, when you were perſuaded to give up your moſt valuable ancient Scripture Privilege of bearing a vocal part of the Public Prayers and Praiſes, and inſtead thereof are allowed the Liberty of holding up your Hand to Vote in every trifling Affair of Church Diſcipline: I would therefore wiſh you to reſume that your ancient Privilege again.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Another thing wherein you appeared to me to have gone off from Scripture Rule and Example, was your Neglect of <hi>bodily Worſhip,</hi> which I proved to be your Duty from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. where we are required <hi>to glorifie GOD with our Bodies, as well as our Spirits.</hi> Particularly I proved <hi>Kneeling</hi> in your Prayers and other Services to be your Duty from the Command, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6. and the Apoſtles Example in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.36. nay, Chriſt himſelf <hi>Kneeled, Luk.</hi> 22.41. To this he makes no Reply, only gives an ill-natured Flout, which deſerves no notice. — I mentioned <hi>Bowing</hi> at the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as a proper Token of our Submiſſion to <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as our Lord and King, our Saviour and our GOD, in oppoſition to the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſies, and as being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently juſtified to be lawful from <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. His only buſineſs in Anſwer to this, was to prove that it is inexpedient or unlawful: Inſtead of which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to a little <hi>Greek,</hi> and ſays it might be rendered
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003784_0065_10025B2BBA9E5900"/>
               <hi>in the Name,</hi> But I ſay if it was ſo rendered, it would not be ſo juſtly rendered as it is now, and for this I appeal to the Critics, and to the Scope of the Apoſtle in that Context. As for his Queſtions that follow, about doing it but once, and to the Eaſt, they are meer Quibbles, and I am not at all concerned to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them, if they deſerved any Notice, as indeed they do not. — I will only ſay, that it is then moſt proper to expreſs our Adoration of him when we confeſs our Faith in him, and that we do in all other parts of our Worſhip, offer up our Addreſſes to GOD <hi>in the Name</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as you.</p>
            <p>But the moſt material Objection you have againſt us on this head is our <hi>Kneeling at the Sacrament;</hi> and as to this, I gave you as briefly as I could, the Reaſons of our Practice: One Reaſon I gave you was this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord's Supper is the moſt ſolemn Act of Worſhip that we can perform, and Kneeling is the proper and Scripture Poſture of Worſhip. — To which this <hi>Remarker</hi> makes no reply at all: And the Reaſon doubtleſs was, becauſe he was not able, for he promiſed at firſt ſetting out, that he would <hi>do</hi> his <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, p.</hi> 2. — And becauſe you commonly think that Chriſt gave this Sacrament to his Apoſtles, Sitting, I obſerved to you, that this was a miſtake, for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poſture in Chriſt's Time was <hi>Leaning;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Sitting</hi> at it, you can't pretend to conform to the manner of the firſt Inſtitution. This alſo he takes no Notice of; for Anſwering was not his Deſign, but Quibbling.</p>
            <p>He indeed tells us that it was firſt adminiſtred in a Table-Poſture, but dare not tell what Table-Poſture he means, for that would have ſpoiled all: nor does he vouchſafe to give us the leaſt Proof of this bold Aſſertion; for altho' it be eaſy to affirm, yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prove that it was firſt adminiſtred in <hi>any</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:003784_0066_10025B2D42CEC7D0"/>
Table-Poſture: And yet he immediately brings a moſt terrible Charge againſt me as being guilty of a <hi>moſt horrid Reflection on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, p.</hi> 41. becauſe I ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how ſcandalouſly indecent is it to receive this Seal of our Pardon, ſitting?— But why ſo haſty, Friend? What makes you think it <hi>a moſt horrid Reflection</hi> on our Lord? This is, in effect, to charge me with Blaſphemy!— Do you really think it as horrid a Reflection, as that of the Phariſees, who ſaid our Saviour <hi>had a Devil?</hi> Or was there never a <hi>Jew, Turk</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> that caſt a more horrid Reflection on Chriſt? Why then, in the ſuperlative Degree?— However, Brethren, being arraigned at your Bar for no leſs a Crime than Blaſphem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which is what muſt be implyed in <hi>moſt horridly reflecting</hi> on Chriſt, I plead <hi>not Guilty;</hi> and to acquit my ſelf, I will prove, That it is ſcandalouſly indecent to receive the Seal of our Pardon, Sitting; and that to ſay ſo, is no horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on our Saviour, becauſe it does not appear that he gave it to his Diſciples, Sitting.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe Propoſitions I argue thus: It is a Rule allowed by all; and the Counterpart of it this very Man pretends to, That <hi>Thoſe Commands in the Decalogue, which forbid a Sin, do at the ſame Time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Contrary Duty:</hi> Thus when the <hi>firſt</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forbids us to acknowledge any <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> it does oblige us to acknowledge the <hi>True God:</hi> So when the <hi>ſecond</hi> Commandment forbids us to <hi>bow down</hi> to falſe Gods and <hi>ſerve them;</hi> it obliges us to practiſe the contrary Duties in our Addreſſes to the true GOD, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>bow down to Him</hi> and <hi>ſerve Him: i e.</hi> To worſhip Him both with our Bodies and Minds.—Therefore as he that either bows or kneels, or uſes any other Poſture of Reverence to a graven Image, breaks the ſecond Commandment, ſo does he who in the moſt ſolemn Act of Worſhip, (ſuch as receiving the Lord's-Supper,) refuſes to uſe ſome ſuch Poſture of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003784_0067_10025B2ED52AC320"/>
Worſhip to GOD: for it is a Contempt of GOD to addreſs his Infinite Majeſty without ſome Poſture of Adoration, as well as a Sin to kneel to an Image, tho' without praying to it, as the Papiſts pretend to do: The one is Idolatry, the other Sacrilege; for the Reaſon why we are forbid to bow down to an Idol, is becauſe it is an Act of Worſhip due to GOD, and whether we give to an Image what is due to GOD, or refuſe to pay it to Him, we are equally Robbers of GOD, we deny Him His Honour, and are guilty of Sacrilege.— I beſeech you, my Brethren, conſider this without Prejudice: I know you <hi>abhor Idolatry;</hi> pray <hi>do not commit Sacrilege,</hi> Rom. 2.22. — I before urged this poſitive Command to you, from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6. <hi>O come let us Worſhip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> Now if ever we would bow our Knees to our Maker, we ought, ſurely, to do it then, when we come to Him in the neareſt Approaches that we are capable of in this World, and with the higheſt Senſe of Gratitude that our Son's can admit of, to remember and adore Him for the moſt aſtoniſhing Inſtance of Love that could be beſtowed on us, even <hi>giving his own Son to die for us:</hi> Certainly if it be not our Duty to kneel before GOD on this moſt ſolemn Occaſion, it is hard to ſay when we are obliged to it: And he that can ſo far diſregard this poſitive Command of GOD, as to ſit down in this neareſt and moſt ſolemn Approach to him, no doubt but he may with as good Reaſon ſit in every other part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſo never bow his Knee to GOD, or give Him any Bodily Worſhip, thro' the whole Courſe of his Life.</p>
            <p>And as Sitting at the Lord's Table is a Tranſgreſſion of the Poſitive Law of GOD; ſo it is likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the Rules of Decency among Men: for this I appeal to any Man's Conſcience: Suppoſe that for ſome grievous Crime you were juſtly condemned to die, and when you were come to the Place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003784_0068_10025B31B5E62438"/>
the King being preſent, ſhould hold out a Pardon to you; I ask in what Poſture would you receive it? Would you ſit on your back-ſide and take it? No, certainly, you would fall on your Knees with the deepeſt Gratitude:— And will you be more unmannerly to GOD than towards Man? — You know that in the Lord's Supper, the Bread and Wine repreſent the Body and Blood of Chriſt, whoſe Death is the alone Foundation of our Pardon: And as the Miniſter delivers you this holy Bread and Wine, ſo GOD at the ſame Time gives you Chriſt, and the Bleſſings He has purchaſed. — Now <hi>does not even Nature teach</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in another Caſe,) that <hi>it is a Shame</hi> to receive our Saviour, Sitting, as tho' we were his Companions rather than his Subjects: But I proved before, that we are to conſider our Saviour now as being in a different Capacity from what he was while on Earth: Then he was in the <hi>Form of a Servant,</hi> but Now He is <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> and GOD hath commanded even <hi>His Angels to worſhip Him, Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16. How much more is it a Duty incumbent on us ſinful Mortals? No ſays this Man, <hi>He allows us to be as free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with Him as ever, p.</hi> 41. Now I would ask, whether this does not look ſomething like a Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Chriſt? The <hi>Pope</hi> indeed conceiting himſelf Chriſt's Vicar, looks upon it as his Privilege to ſit at the Sacrament; and pray conſider, whether it does not look like Symbolizing with him for you to do ſo? —I add <hi>laſtly,</hi> on this Head, — We find St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeverely reproved the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their irrevence in receiving the Sacrament, and threatned them with <hi>Damnation</hi> for their <hi>not diſcerning the Lord's Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29. i. e. Their not making a difference between the Lord's Table and their own, but receiving it as common Food: —Now he that ſits at the Lord's Table, as to his outward Deportment, makes no Difference between the Lord's Table &amp; his own; he makes no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:003784_0069_10025B354946E4A8"/>
between the Body and Blood of Chriſt and Common Food.</p>
            <p>It is pleaded on your ſide, That if Chriſt gave this Sacrament to His Apoſtles, Sitting, then it is lawful at leaſt, for us ſo to receive it.— I anſwer, It is a great Miſtake to think that Chriſt gave it to his Diſciples, Sitting: For every Man that has but the ſmalleſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Original, and the Cuſtoms of thoſe Times, muſt know that they did not ſit down as we do now, but lay down on Couches, ſo that their Feet came behind each other, and they <hi>leaned on</hi> each others <hi>Breaſt, John</hi> 21.20. — Well, but ſay you, this was a <hi>Table-Poſture,</hi> — I anſwer, We have no Reaſon to think that Chriſt gave this Sacrament to his Diſciples while they continued in this Poſture. There is not the leaſt Intimation of any ſuch thing in either of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> but it is highly probable that they changed their Poſture, before they received it. — Pray take your Pibles, and turn to <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.22. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. We there find that after they had eaten the <hi>Supper of unleavened Bread,</hi> which was called the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> (but not the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> for that was not killed till the next Day, and that by the Prieſt at the Temple,) I ſay, after this Supper was over, <hi>Chriſt took Bread, and gave Thanks and Bleſſed it:</hi> Now you cannot think, that the Apoſtles conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in that Poſture, while Chriſt was giving Thanks, and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> or <hi>Praying:</hi> — If you think they did ſo, Why don't you ſit ſtill or lie down, while your Miniſter is praying over the Bread and Wine? No, you think they roſe up and put themſelves into a worſhipping Poſture, or elſe how dare you do ſo? So that it is plain, and your own Practice ſhews you believe that neither Chriſt nor his Diſciples did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a Table-Poſture, but put themſelves into a Worſhipping-Poſture, when this Sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.—If you ſay. None of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their riſing up from the Table to Pray and give
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:003784_0070_10025B36CD8F5040"/>
Thanks, — I anſwer, neither was there any need of it, ſince the change of Action from eating to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thanks, does ſufficiently ſignifie and infer a Change of Poſture. Neither <hi>Matthew</hi> nor <hi>Mark</hi> nor <hi>Luke</hi> mention Chriſt's Changing his Poſture, from the Time that they firſt ſat down that Evening, till they aroſe to go into the Garden, and yet it is certain that they did riſe up and ſit down again after Supper, <hi>John</hi> 13 4. &amp;c. — Now if Chriſt and his Apoſtles did riſe to pray over the Bread and Wine, (which you muſt own, or condemn your ſelves,) then pray tell me where you find that they ſat down again to receive it after it was conſecrated? If Mr. <hi>J. G.</hi> can do this, then I will own my Guilt, but till this be done, which I am ſure no Man can do that has not another Bible than I have, I muſt look on him as a falſe Accuſer. — I intreat you therefore, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, no longer to entertain that Notion, which has no foundation in the Bible, that Chriſt gave this Sacrament to his Diſciples, ſitting; nor is there one Inſtance in all that holy Book, of one good Man that Worſhipped GOD, in that indecent Poſture, and it is contrary to many expreſs Commands that injoyn Bodily Worſhip, as I ſhewed you before.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>J. G.</hi> tells you <hi>that kneeling at the Sacrament had its riſe from thoſe that adore the Elements.</hi> I anſwer, It is true he ſays ſo, and that is all: Intreat him in his next to prove it, and a great many more untruths that he has confidently aſſerted. — I am ſure Mr. <hi>Bingham</hi> in his <hi>Orig. Eccleſ. l.</hi> 15. makes it evident, That the Primitive Church never uſed the Poſture of Sitting at the Sacrament, and that they always uſed a Poſture of Adoration, either Standing or Kneeling. He quotes among others St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> whoſe Words are theſe, <q>Approach, <hi>ſays he,</hi> not rudely, but bowing thy ſelf, and in a Poſture of Worſhip and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </q> Now St. <hi>Cyril</hi> lived in the Year 350, whereas <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Adoring the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:003784_0071_10025B39748553E8"/>
Elements,</hi> came not into the Church till about 1200 as Mr. <hi>Dalice</hi> proves. So that an adoring Poſture was certainly uſed, at leaſt above 800 Years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tranſubſtantiation; ſo far from Truth is what he here aſſerts! — But ſuppoſing, (not granting,) that it was ſo, does that make it unlawful for thoſe to kneel that have no deſign or thought of adoring the Elements? Pray look into our <hi>Rubric</hi> in the end of the <hi>Communion-Service;</hi> and then charge us with adoring the Elements if you can. And why is it not as good to ſymbolize with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in uſing a reverent Poſture, as with the <hi>Arians</hi> or <hi>Socinians</hi> in an irreverent one. The <hi>Arians,</hi> or rather <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny Chriſt's Divinity, firſt brought in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Practice of Sitting at the Lord's Supper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought it unlawful to worſhip Chriſt: I don't deſire you to take this upon my bare Word, as he does what he ſays, but I will give you the very Words of the Proteſtant Church in <hi>Poland:</hi> The Words of their genera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Synod was held in the Year, 1578. — And now I hope I have ſaid enough to convince you, if Reaſon or Scripture will convince you, That it is a ſcandalous us Indecency to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, Sitting.</p>

            <p>When he ſays, Sin is only a <hi>Negation,</hi> a meer <hi>Non-Entity,</hi> the true meaning of it is, That it <hi>is not;</hi> that, properly ſpeaking, it has <hi>no Being,</hi> or there is <hi>nothing</hi> in it; for <hi>non-Entity</hi> is as much as to ſay <hi>not-Being:</hi> And ſo he has made a very harmleſs Buſineſs of it — This is delicate Philoſophy! and fine Divinity! — It was by the ſame ſort of Philoſophy, that ſome Philoſophers of old, undertook to prove that <hi>Pain is no Evil,</hi> and others, that <hi>there is no ſuch Thing as Motion in Nature;</hi> and by the ſame ſort of Philoſophy, ſome more modern Philoſophers taught, <hi>That it is better to be exquiſited, and forever Miſerable, than not to be:</hi> and it is by the ſame kind of Philoſophy, that ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels of theſe Times undertake to prove, <hi>That there is no ſuch Thing as Liberty of acting, either in GOD or Man.</hi>— I confeſs, I am not ignorant either of this Philoſophy, or Divinity, tho' GOD forbid I ſhould uſe any of it: No, my Brethren, this an Inſtance of that <hi>vain Philoſophy,</hi> that <hi>Science falſly ſo called,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids you <hi>beware of, Col.</hi> 2.8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20.

And are there not poſitive Tranſgreſſions of negative Precepts or Prohibitions, as well as negative Omiſſions of poſitive Duties? — The Truth is — He does by this Doctrine confound the very <hi>Aſſembly</hi>'s <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> which it was his Buſineſs to defend, for that defines <hi>Sin</hi> to be, not only, a <hi>want of Conformity unto,</hi> (which is the negative part of it) but alſo <hi>a Tranſgreſſion of the Law of GOD,</hi> which is the poſitive part of it.— However, whether according to his Metaphſics, it be <hi>Entity</hi> or <hi>Non-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> be it <hi>negative</hi> or <hi>poſitive,</hi> I am ſure none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that it hath, properly ſpeaking <hi>come to paſs;</hi> and therefore, in a Word, ſo ſure as Sinners are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves of an inward Averſion to Holineſs, and Pleaſure in ſinful Practices, and of a violent, habitual, impetuous Tendency towards the commiſſion of them; ſo ſure as you ſee with your Eyes, and hear with your Ears, &amp; underſtand with your Hearts, that there are ſuch Things, as Murthers, Thefts, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Lying, Swearing, Curſing, <hi>&amp;c</hi> ſo ſure Sin has, properly Speaking, a <hi>Being</hi> in the World; and ſo ſure it is that GOD could not ordain or will it, and therefore he has not <hi>foreordained</hi> whatſoever comes to paſs.</p>

               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:003784_0075_10025B43118751E8"/>Indeed he durſt not ſpeak out and own the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, tho' it be ſo evidently contained in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and therefore he ſays, what GOD does about Sin, is, a <hi>willing Permiſſion</hi> of it: That is, (in plain Engliſh,) tho' GOD does not decree Sin, yet he is very willing it ſhould be, becauſe, otherwiſe, (according to his Doctrine,) he could not get Glory to his Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the Puniſhment of it: But this is not a whit better than to ſay He Decreed it; for <hi>he that Wills the End, muſt Will the Means. — To permit Sin,</hi> (eſpecially according to his Metaphyſical Explication of it,) may ſeem too ſtrong an Expreſſion; but if all that is meant by it were, that GOD does not poſitively interpoſe to hinder it: This we allow; becauſe ſo to do would be to alter his own Workmanſhip, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Neceſſity upon thoſe Creatures which he has made to act freely, and this he could not do, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Law of their Nature which he has made, <hi>i. e.</hi> he could not wiſely do it, at leaſt in the ordinary Courſe of Things; and becauſe to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them to good or bad, would be to deſtroy the very being of Duty or Sin, of Virtue or Vice, ſince the very Eſſence or Nature of Virtue or Duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the free and willing Obedience, and of Vice or Sin, in the free and wilful Diſobedience to the Law of GOD. — The other of GOD's Works about Sin, he ſays, is the <hi>Gubernation, i. e.</hi> the Government of it: — This is an odd Expreſſion: However I ſhall not contend with him about it, provided what he means by it, is only, that GOD over-rules the Sins and Follies of Men in ſuch a Manner as to bring Good out of Evil, and make them turn to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of his own Ends in the Government of the World: — This I own he may do, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing Himſelf that ſhall neceſſitate them to Sin: Which I ſuppoſe, is what he means by His having <hi>no actual Efficiency into the real Anomy thereof:</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:003784_0076_10025B44B634F7E8"/>
But I can't help obſerving here, what an odd way of Speaking it is to talk of the <hi>Anomy</hi> of Sin: It is as much as to ſay the Sin of Sin, for <hi>Anomy</hi> is only a <hi>Greek</hi> Word, by which the ſame Thing is meant, as we mean by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word <hi>Sin,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4.

            <p>As to the Doctrine of <hi>abſolute Reprobation,</hi> this he does, in effect, give up: For he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 43. <hi>GOD did not ordain any Creature to abſolute Damnation, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="unknown:003784_0077_10025B482A8D6AD8"/>
That in denying Abſolute Reprobation he denys his own Articles, and therefore with what Face can he charge me with denying any of the Articles of the Church. — That he denys his own Articles in denying Abſolute Reprobation, is evident: For theſe are the Words of your <hi>Aſſembly</hi>'s <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> which he has aſſented to, <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21, — <q>GOD hath not Decreed any thing becauſe he foreſaw it as future, or would come to paſs upon ſuch Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q> And <q>By the Decree of GOD, for the Manifeſtation of his Glory, ſome Men and Angels are predeſtinated to everlaſting Life, and others are fore-ordained to everlaſting Death.</q> And <q>theſe Angels and Men thus predeſtinated and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained are particularly and unchangeably deſigned, and their number ſo certain and definite, that it cannot be either encreaſed or diminiſhed.</q> — You ſee it is plain from theſe Words of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that they are <hi>particularly, unchangeably</hi> and <hi>unconditionally,</hi> or abſolutely, <hi>ordained,</hi> ſome <hi>to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life,</hi> and others <hi>to everlaſting Death,</hi> and not <hi>becauſe GOD foreſaw</hi> ſuch or <hi>ſuch Conditions;</hi> either Holineſs in the one, or Sin in the other. — So that, as I ſaid in denying abſolute Reprobation, he plainly denys his own Articles; let him therefore hereafter forbear charging others with denying theirs. — But the other Remark I would make here, is, That he is not only inconſiſtent with his Articles, but alſo with himſelf. For he had ſaid juſt before, that in GOD's Decrees. <hi>He conſulted the Counſel of His own Will, and not the Wills of any of his Creatures.</hi>— Whereas, If he decreed the Reprobate <hi>to Damnation for Sin,</hi> as he owns here, and if <hi>they fall into Sin by their own Wills,</hi> as he here alſo ſays, it is plain that GOD in ordaining them to Damnation muſt have had an Eye at their Wills in making this Decree. — So apt are thoſe on that ſide to run into Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:003784_0078_10025B49AECC1270"/>
in explaining their Notions!— To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I earneſtly beſeech you, Brethren, to beware of theſe Doctrines, ſo full of Inconſiſtencies, and I may add, of moſt fatal and pernicious Conſequences, as tending to beget in your Minds very gloomy, hard and unworthy Thoughts of GOD, and to diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and diſcourage you from an earneſt and engaged purſuit of the Eternal Intereſts of your Souls: ſince any one will be apt to ſay, If my Fate is already before-hand determined by an abſolute inexorable Decree of GOD, all my Endeavours can do no Good: If I am to be ſaved, GOD will ſometime or other bring me home, whether I ſtrive no; and if I am to be forever miſerable, all my Endeavours can never prevent it: Than which Concluſion, nothing can be more pernicious to the Souls of Men! — Let me rather exhort you to <hi>work out your Salvation with fear and trembling, for it is GOD that worketh in you to will and to do:</hi> And you may depend upon it there is no abſolute Decree in your way; <hi>You ſhall reap in due Time, if you faint not.</hi>

               </gap>ticular Examination of this vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Triumph, yet it ſeemed not unneceſſary to add here, ſome brief Animadverſions of the Author of theſe Letters, by way of Reply to it; which are as follows.</p>
            <p>It would be almoſt endleſs, if I ſhould take Notice of every particular Inſtance of this Gentleman's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair Dealing: He often ſtrains my Expreſſions, and thoſe of the Authors he quotes, into meanings which neither they nor I ever intended, and then laboriouſly fights with his own Shadow: In other Inſtances, and thoſe very many, he has nothing but a Sett of meer Quibbles, for two or three Pages together: And in others he ſeems induſtriouſly to go beſides the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſomuch that I really wiſh I could ſee for what End he could write, at leaſt, half this long-winded Pamphlet, unleſs it were purely to amuſe his Readers with a tedious Verboſity, and to ſee how much he
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:003784_0081_10025B51B12EFCF8"/>
could ſay upon the Subject. — In ſuch a captious, quibbling Way of Writing, there is truly ſcarce any thing but what may be anſwered: Even the moſt ſacred Cauſes of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> nay, and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf, are not without Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that can find Art enough to make a plauſible Pretenſe of anſwering. — With reſpect to ſuch a management it was, that Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as I remember, ſays, ſomewhere, <q>He ſhould never think the worſe of a Book becauſe it was pretended to be anſwered.</q>
And as to the Letters under Conſideration, I can't think but I may ſay, with, at leaſt, as much Juſtice as <hi>Elutherius</hi> does concering his <hi>Dialogues, p.</hi> 2. <q>That a new Edition of them would be a ſufficient Reply to his Invectives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The main Artifice that runs thro' his Performance, conſiſts in producing long and numerous Quotations from ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable Writers of our Church, eſpecially in their Writings againſt Popery, which he would have his unwary Readers believe, from a meer Gingle of the Words, to be deſtructive to the Cauſe of the Church to which they adhered, and which they ſo admirably defended: As if thoſe great Men did not know how to Write conſiſtent with themſelves; or, as if what we plead for were arrant Popery, and the Arguments and Manner of Speaking they uſe, were as much inconſiſtent with, and ſubverſive of what we plead in behalf of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, as of the great Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they impugn. — Seriouſly I can ſcarce conceive, how this Gentlemen can think himſelf in earneſt, in the uſe he pretends to make of thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; for there is not a tenth part of all his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Quotations from <hi>Jewel, Hooker, Chillingworth</hi> and <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> &amp;c. but which take them as they lie in the Authors themſelves, and with the Views they had in Writing them, and I do highly approve of them, and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:003784_0082_10025B534FD58B08"/>
can find nothing in them, that is at all really incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with what I contend for, nor with the way of Reaſoning that I uſe. — They were certainly as great and good Men, and as excellent Defenders of our Church, as ever the Nation bred, and are remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable for a prodigious vein of Reaſon and Eloquence: And I can't help ſaying, with reſpect to <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Chillingworth</hi> in particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it ſeems to me, the Man who has ſeriouſly read and conſidered, and at the ſame Time is not convinced by their mighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings in behalf of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as well as the other things they contend for, muſt have a Mind of a very ſtrange and odd Sort of make.</p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>Phileleuth.</hi> indeed, pretends <hi>p.</hi> 3. from <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s Authority, that Mr. <hi>Hooker, l.</hi> 3. held Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was <hi>mutable,</hi> and might be <hi>abrogated;</hi> which is a Specimen of <hi>Edwards</hi>'s uſual abuſive Miſrepreſentation of his Authors: For the Truth is, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> is there ſpeaking of Prudential Conſtitutions, reſpecting the <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> of the Epiſcopal Government, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtitutions of Religion, and not of Epiſcopacy <hi>it ſelf,</hi> which he ſtrenuouſly holds to be founded on the Word of GOD, in that very Book, §. <hi>ult.</hi> and the ſame is evident from his 7th Book, where he ſays, §. 1. (and afterwards abundantly proves it,) <q>Neither hath Chriſtianity been ever Planted in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom throughout the World, but with this kind of Government alone, which to have been ordained of GOD, I am for my own part, as reſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, as that any other kind of Government in the World whatſoever is of GOD.</q> — Could he then think it <hi>mutable</hi> or that it <hi>might be abrogated?</hi> — What is there that ſome People, to ſerve a Turn, will not ſay?</p>
            <p>And as to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Demonſtration of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> let Mr. <hi>Phileleuth.</hi> ſay what he will about
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:003784_0083_10025B54D4F1C930"/>
               <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Strictures, and one <hi>Lauder</hi>'s pretended Confutation of it, <hi>p.</hi> 136. I can't yet believe, there ever was, or will be, a juſt Confutation of it; for it really is, what it pretends to be, A Demonſtration in it's kind. — And for this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to pretend, becauſe Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> in his Modeſt Way of ſpeaking mentions Epiſcopacy, as being <hi>not repugnant to the Government left in the Churches by the Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. that this is all he undertakes to prove, is very wrong, for he knows that what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to demonſtrate, is, that it was really Inſtituted by the Apoſtles, and that it is to this Concluſion that he affixes his <hi>Q. E. D.</hi> And does <hi>this make nothing to our Cauſe?</hi> Pray wherein does the <hi>"unaccountable Folly"</hi> conſiſt of my alledging this Demonſtration? I am not willing to ſay, it was an unaccountable want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity in him, to miſrepreſent it as he does.— He ſays, We read nothing there of Epiſcopacy's being a <hi>Fundamental</hi> of Religion: —But, If it was an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Apoſtles, as he has demonſtrated it to be, I deſire to know how much that falls ſhort of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a Fundamental, ſince the Apoſtles were under the Direction of the Spirit of GOD in Planting and Settling the Churches — I own it is only an external of Religion, and ſo were the two Sacraments, and I ſhould be glad to be informed, ſuppoſing it proved to be an Apoſtolical Inſtitution, way it is not at leaſt as much a Fundamental in Chriſtianity, as <hi>Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> and the <hi>Firſt-Day-Sabbath,</hi> which I conclude he holds to be Fundamentals, <hi>i. e. Neceſſary;</hi> why then ſhould he be ſo much <hi>amazed</hi> as he pretends to be, that I eſteem Epiſcopacy Fundamental. Sure I am, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and a proper Form of it, are things of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance enough in themſelves to be made Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, by being appointed by the Apoſtles; and I will be free to ſay, that if Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi> and I may add, <hi>Potter, Slater, Sage, Brett, Bingham</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:003784_0084_10025B57C1E926A8"/>
and many others, (nay even <hi>Hoadly</hi> himſelf,) have not, by fair and juſt Reaſoning, proved the <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>Divine</hi> Inſtitution of Epiſcopacy, ſo that nothing but Scepticiſm, that will cavil at any thing, can pretend to diſpute it, I for my part ſhall deſpair of ever ſeeing any thing proved.</p>
            <p>The chief uſe he makes of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> againſt me is to diſprove what I plead for, reſpecting the uſe we make of the Fathers, in finding out the true Senſe of the Scriptures in diſputed Caſes.— Now as to this, I was ſenſible I had not ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained my ſelf in my <hi>firſt Letter,</hi> and therefore in my <hi>ſecond Letter,</hi> I endeavoured to explain my ſelf in ſuch a manner as, I tho't, Ill-Will it ſelf could not mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>repreſent.— My Principle, as I then explain'd it, was to this Effect,— "That I take the H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the only Rule of my Faith and Practice, which is the great Fundamental Principle of the Church of <hi>England:</hi>— But inaſmuch as every Sect of Chriſtianity do alſo pretend to the Scriptures as their Rule; and there are ſeveral Texts, eſpecially reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the External Polity of the Church, that are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently underſtood by different Sects: I judged the ſafeſt and moſt undoubted way to aſcertain the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Texts, after all the Light we could get from the Scriptures themſelves, was to appeal to the Facts and Practices that univerſally obtained in the Church, immediately after Scripture-Times, and ſo downwards thro' the firſt and pureſt Ages, and to the Fathers who lived in thoſe Times, only as Witneſſes what thoſe Facts really were."— This Method I found our Diſſenting Brethren themſelves took, and that very juſtly, to eſtabliſh the <hi>Firſt-Day Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> which they eſteem as much Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals as we do <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and therefore they muſt either allow our Method of Reaſoning to be good, or own that they are inconſiſtent with themſelves.</p>

               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:003784_0085_10025B5C01E8CCD0"/>Now this ſtating of the Caſe Mr. <hi>Phileleuth.</hi> takes little, or no Notice of in his Reply, and leaves his Friend miſerably helpleſs where he moſt needed his help; and one would think, by his Neglect of him in this Affair, that he was willing to Sacrifice In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm, and the Firſt-Day Sabbath themſelves, ſo that he might but deſtroy Epiſcopacy with them— All this he artfully conceals and keeps out of ſight, and inſtead of attending to it, as he ought to have done, in faithfulneſs to his Friend, and his own ſide; and notwithſtanding that I had abundantly cleared my ſelf from ſuch an Imputation: He would ſtill invidiouſly have it believed, <hi>p.</hi> 72.

Bp. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> &amp;c. as tho' they condemned my way of Reaſoning; whereas, (however ſome few Paſſages may carry a different Sound with them, yet) in the whole, what they contend for is not at all inconſiſtent with it; ſo far from this, that their Reaſoning againſt the Roman Catholics, is, in many Inſtances upon the ſame foot with mine againſt the Presbyterians, who are both alike condemned by the Facts of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. — But as to the Paſſages he quotes, let the impartial Inquirer examin them in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors themſelves, and compare them with what I plead, and he will readily ſee the Difference — They were pleading againſt the Corruptions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced ſome Hundreds of Years after the Apoſtles; whereas I was pleading for a Practice univerſally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining from their Days: — They were pleading againſt the Authority of Fathers that lived after the Introduction of thoſe Innovations, and of Writings of uncertain Authority; whereas I was pleading from the Authority of the Fathers who lived in the Apoſtolic
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:003784_0086_10025B5D87B192F0"/>
Age, and the two next Ages after them:— They were pleading againſt the Authority of the pretended oral or unwritten Traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> i. e. againſt Things which the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, were, for ſeveral Ages, handed down from Age to Age, by Word of Mouth, for which they could produce no written Tradition at all; whereas I was pleading from the Authority of what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and recorded by very many, and thoſe the moſt faithful Witneſſes of Antiquity, of different Countrys, Nations and Languages, yet all conſpiring in Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſame Facts: — The R. Catholics pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have Traditionary Interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo handed down, to juſtify what they hold, which I do with <hi>Chillingworth</hi> and <hi>Tillotſon</hi> diſclaim, and with them do appeal to open Univerſal Facts atteſted to by the Fathers, as being what were obvious to every Man's Senſes, nor do I argue from any Facts univerſally obtaining in any one Age alone, which, I deny not but that they might be contrary to Facts as generally obtaining in another Age; but I argue from Facts that obtained in every Age, from the Beginning of Chriſtianity?— How diſingenuouſly then does this Gentleman deal, in pretending thoſe Authors were at all againſt me, and when he knows they were in the ſame Sentiment with me, on the Subject now under Debate?</p>
            <p>My Adverſary had written very contemptuouſly of the Fathers, and their Authority and Uſefulneſs: This I tho't it neceſſary to animadvert upon, as tending to favour the Cauſe of Infidelity, by weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if not deſtroying the external Evidence of the Canon of the New-Teſtament, which can no otherwiſe be Eſtabliſhed but by the Teſtimony of the Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are likewiſe Witneſſes to Epiſcopacy.— And truly after all that this Gentleman has ſaid, on this Head, I ſhould be glad to be made ſenſible that the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:003784_0087_10025B5F18EB8C10"/>
Caſe is otherwiſe.— Does it not weaken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe of Chriſtianity to weaken any one of the Evidences of it? Is not the Teſtimony of the earlieſt Chriſtian Writers to the Apoſtolical authority of the ſeveral Books of the New Teſtament a mighty Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their being Genuine? And are they not the ſame Men who are Witneſſes to their Apoſtolic Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and their being univerſally received as ſuch, that are alſo Witneſſes to the Apoſtolic Original of Epiſcopacy, and its univerſal Reception? Does not therefore the weakening their Credibility with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the one, weaken it alſo with regard to the other? If the Scriptures were tranſlated into divers Languages, and diſperſed throughout all Countrys, did not Epiſcopacy go every where with them? If the Scriptures were handed down from Age to Age, was not Epiſcopacy handed down with them? Nay were they not Biſhops that handed them down, and ſpread them abroad ſucceſſively, with the ſucceſſive Communication of their own Order? They received the Holy Books at firſt from the Apoſtles, with their Orders, and conveyed them to others ſucceſſively, with the ſame Orders. — And whatever this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or others may pretend againſt a Succeſſion of Biſhops, can He or They find one Age or Nation of Chriſtendom, without Biſhops, till of late, or wherein a Succeſſive Ordination or Conſecration by Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands was not practiſed and held neceſſary for conveying that Character? If there have been ſome Irregularities in the Manner, muſt they deſtroy the Eſſence of the Thing? And if in any particular Church the Succeſſion may have failed, did it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or could it, fail in the whole? If GOD's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was engaged for the Preſervation of the Scriptures, was it not alſo engaged to preſerve a true Succeſſion of thoſe who were to convey them down, and to explain and enforce them, and to <hi>be always with them to the End of the World?</hi>

Selves, to joyn with us againſt the common Enemy?</p>
            <p>Put to go on,</p>
            <p>This Gentleman, <hi>p.</hi> 91. ſuggeſts as tho' I inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated that the Divinity of Chriſt was doubtful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I mentioned it with Epiſcopacy, as an Inſtance wherein the Matters of Fact atteſted by the Fathers, are highly uſeful to ſatisfy us, that we take up a right Notion of the Scripture-Senſe. Now, why ſhould this be invidiouſly repreſented, as tho' I doubted whether the Divinity of Chriſt was plainly taught in Scripture? He knows I was not ſpeaking of either the one or the other, as being doubtful to me, but as being diſputed, &amp; conſequently doubted by others: He is not ignorant that there are thoſe that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Plainneſs of Scripture, pretend to doubt, whether the Conſubſtantiality of the Son with the Father be a Scripture-Doctrine? And to ſatisfy them in this matter, I ſay it is highly uſeful to appeal to the Teſtimony of the Fathers, whether that was conſtantly taught from the Beginning as a Scripture-Doctrine or not? The ſame I ſay with reſpect to Epiſcopacy, It appears to me not doubtful but ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently plain from Scripture, to be an Apoſtolical Inſtitution; but ſince there are thoſe that doubt and diſpute it, I plead, that the conſequent Facts ought, in all reaſon, to ſatisfy, any one that it was ſo.</p>
            <p>But he ſays, ſuppoſing the Fact or Epiſcopacy ever ſo well atteſted, <q>He that argues from <hi>Fact</hi> to <hi>Right</hi> is a meer Sophiſter.</q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 80.— I allow this in all other Facts but ſuch as are done under the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conduct of the unerring Spirit of GOD; but in this Caſe we may be undoubtedly argue from <hi>Fact</hi> to <hi>Right:</hi> The Apoſtles did, in <hi>Fact,</hi> wherever they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated Chriſtianity, inſtitute Epiſcopacy; we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly conclude, that Form of Government, and that only, to be <hi>Right,</hi> and that it is our bounden Duty to ſubmit to it, and that it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in all Churches to the End of the World.—
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:003784_0091_10025B69A0D6AD60"/>
Is this Sophiſtry? No ſure, There can be no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of erring in arguing thus: The only Queſtion then is, whether the Apoſtles did in Fact inſtitute Epiſcopacy? We think it plain from Scripture, that they did, in the Perſons of <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> of the ſeven Churches; and we are well aſſured that we are not miſtaken, ſince we find it ſo clearly atteſted by the Fathers, <hi>Clemens, Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which I quoted, beſides many others, within the three firſt Centuries ſucceſſively, that I might have mentioned, and which have often over and over been alledged, that the Apoſtles did every where inſtitute Epiſcopacy, in our Senſe of it. Nay Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> (whom he ſo baſely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſents, and ſo emptily Triumphs in,) ſays, in the Margin of his Demonſtration, that <q>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> has fully demonſtrated it, in his <hi>Diſſertations againſt Blondel,</hi> (which, ſays he, never were anſwered, and never will) by the Teſtimonies of thoſe, who wrote in the very next Ages after the Apoſtles</q>. not to mention <hi>Molineus</hi>'s, <hi>Beza</hi>'s, <hi>Chamier</hi>'s and <hi>Vedelius</hi>'s Conceſſions, on which he builds his Demonſtration. — But of the Facts themſelves, I ſhall ſay more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>His grand Objection againſt my way of arguing is taken from the <hi>Chiliaſt</hi> Notion of <hi>Chriſt's perſonal Reign on Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Communicating of Infants:</hi>— Theſe, he pleads were univerſal <hi>Facts</hi> of the primitive Church, and we may as well, argue the <hi>Right</hi> of them, as of Epiſcopacy, from the ſame Reaſon.— To all which, I anſwer— <hi>Firſt,</hi> Suppoſing the Caſe to be as he repreſents it, his Friend <hi>Elutherius</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent in appealing with ſo much Aſſurance to the univerſal Fact of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> in thoſe Days in Proof of it's Divine Inſtitution. And you muſt never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after pretend to argue from the Fathers, but be confined to Scripture alone in proving, that and the <hi>Firſt-Day-Sabbath,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="unknown:003784_0092_10025B6BD39F73E8"/>
in both which Caſes, your Adverſaries will perhaps be even with you, at leaſt, if Antiquity be not taken into the Account — But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Inſtances of the <hi>Chiliaſt</hi> Opinion and <hi>Communicating of Infants,</hi> are not in any meaſure upon a par with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy:</hi> For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the <hi>Communicating of Infants,</hi> I cannot find that there is any one Father within the the 3 firſt Centuries that ever pretended they had that Practice from the Apoſtles: Nay, I am perſuaded it cannot be made appear to be Univerſal Matter of Fact within the 2 firſt Centuries. — There are indeed two Paſſages, one in <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the pretended <hi>Areopagite,</hi> and another in the <hi>Clementine Conſtitutions,</hi> which are both Writings of very dubious Authority, that ſeem to allude to ſuch a Cuſtom's obtaining in their Time, and there is a Paſſage or two in St <hi>Cyprian</hi> that ſeem to imply as much: I ſay theſe three Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and two of them of very doubtful Authority, are all that I can find concerning this Cuſtom within the 3 firſt Centuries; and will this Gentleman pretend <hi>Communicating Infants</hi> is proved to be equally early, and univerſal Matter of Fact with Epiſcopacy, and equally derived from the Apoſtles? What partiality is here? I deny not that it was practiſed in <hi>Africa</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Time, and ſo was <hi>Rebaptiſing Heretics,</hi> which laſt mentioned Practice, tho' it obtained there, was contrary to the general Practice of the Church; &amp; ſo might the former for ought that appears to the contrary. It is confeſſed, that this Practice did at length, by degrees univerſally obtain in the Church, and in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Time, in the beginning of the 5th Century, it was (as ſeveral other irregularities were, that had crept into the Church by that Time,) pretended to have been derived down by Tradition from the Apoſtles, but there does not appear to have been any manner of Foundation for ſuch a pretenſe. — What then is this to the Caſe of Epiſcopacy, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly mentioned in every Age from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:003784_0093_10025B6F67A6F488"/>
as derived from the Apoſtles? And I am free to own that if this Practice could be made appear as evidently to have been derived from the Apoſtles, as Epiſcopacy, I ſhould have the like Veneration for it as I have for that, eſpecially, provided alſo there were as good Grounds for it in the Scriptures as there are for that: Whereas there does not appear to be any Grounds at all.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to the <hi>Chiliaſt Opinion,</hi> it conſiſted only in adhering too ſtrictly to the Letter of that Paſſage in the 20th of <hi>Revelations,</hi> concerning the Saints <hi>Reigning with Chriſt a</hi> 1000 <hi>Years.</hi> — This No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I own, did get conſiderable Footing in the Church in the ſecond and third Centuries; but it took it's Riſe from the ſingle Teſtimony of <hi>Papias,</hi> an honeſt, but weak Man, who pretended he had it from St. <hi>John,</hi> as the true Senſe of that Paſſage in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> in which it is eaſy to imagin he might be miſtaken: But it does not appear to have been ever the <hi>univerſal</hi> Belief of the Church. — It is true, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> and Archbp. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> do make uſe of it againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſpeak of it as being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received: But Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> ſince, in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> has, I think effectually confuted the Arguments they uſe, and made it ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, from even <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> themſelves, who were <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> and from <hi>Origen,</hi> That it never was the univerſal Doctrine of the Church: For Brevity I omit his Arguments, and beg the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> in that Treatiſe, where I think he cannot fail of receiving Satisfaction in this Point. — Upon the whole, I cannot ſee, that either our Cauſe, or my way of Reaſoning in Defence of it, are at all endangered by what this Gentleman argues from that Practice of Communicating Infants, or this Opinion of the <hi>Chiliaſts:</hi> They do by no means appear to be parallel Inſtances with Epiſcopacy: All his boaſting therefore on this Head is utterly empty and vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:003784_0094_10025B70EBCDCE60"/>And now we are come to the Stating of the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in order to which I had made this Obſervation, as being what I judged juſt in it ſelf, as well as a neceſſary Means in order to prevent contending about Words, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no more arguing from the promiſcuous Uſe of the Words <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> to prove them the ſame Order, than from the promiſcuous Uſe of the Words <hi>Apoſtle, Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacon</hi> to prove them to be the ſame Order: Now I can ſee little elſe but meer Cavilling in all that is ſaid on this head: I readily allow the Word <hi>Deacon,</hi> when applied to the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not uſed in a reſtrained Senſe to ſignifie the Office ſo called, but it is evidently ſo far reſtrained as to ſignifie the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office in general; for he is there ſpeaking of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, <hi>whereof,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I am made a Miniſter;</hi> and therefore what I contend for is, that as the Word <hi>Deacon</hi> or Miniſter does not always ſignifie a particular Office in the Miniſtry, ſo neither can the Word <hi>Biſhop</hi> be neceſſarily ſuppoſed to ſignifie a particular Office: And that therefore a <hi>Presbyter</hi> is an <hi>Overſeer</hi> or <hi>Biſhop,</hi> only in the ſame Senſe as an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is a Miniſter or <hi>Deacon;</hi> thoſe Terms being always reſtrained to the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, tho' not always to any particular Office of it: And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls himſelf a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. as what was implyed in his Apoſtle-ſhip, tho' not therefore implying all that his Apoſtle-ſhip did imply. So that what I plead is, that it is plain, and nothing can be plainer, than that theſe Words being all frequently uſed in a general Senſe in the New-Teſtament, there is no certain arguing from them to the more reſtrained Senſe in which they were uſed afterwards; and that therefore we ought to leave off arguing from the promiſcuous Uſe of Words, and to be determined wholly by Facts. Accordingly I ſtated the Queſtion between us to be this, — <hi>Whether the Apoſtles did not appoint in each Church, a Preſident or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Superior to, and with Juriſdiction over the Presbyters
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:003784_0095_10025B762D7ECA20"/>
and Deacons, who were Officers of that Church, as well as the People under them?</hi> And here I muſt own, It was a vain attempt for me to endeavour by Words to <hi>fix</hi> any one of this Gentleman's ſceptical Humour: One might as well undertake to fix <hi>Proteus</hi> himſelf to one particular Shape: For tho' I believe there is nobody that had a Mind to underſtand another, and that was not reſolved to indulge a meer Strife about Words, but would readily enough comprehend my meaning; yet Mr. <hi>Phileleuth.</hi> notwithſtanding he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf owns with me that we ſhould <hi>wholly leave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about Terms, p.</hi> 101 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and profeſſes he <hi>deſires to underſtand, and hates and ſcorns a meer ſtrife of Words, is</hi> ſadly puzzled to underſtand me, and ſpends no leſs than 5 Pages, here, beſides many more elſe where in carping and quibbling upon the Words of the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as I have ſtated it: And I muſt again explain what I mean by a Church? And what I mean by a Governor or Preſident of it, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Tho I had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently explained my ſelf on all theſe Points before.</p>
            <p>Now as to the <hi>firſt,</hi> it is plain to me from Scripture and Antiquity, that by a <hi>particular Church</hi> was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily meant all the Chriſtians of a City, with the adjacent Country depending on it, even tho' they conſiſted of many Congregations; as I proved they generally did, even in the moſt Primitive Times: I have owned that it was many Years before any Parochial Bounds were fixed to the ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, this being meerly a circumſtantial Thing. In this ſenſe I ſhewed, we muſt unavoidably under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Churches of <hi>Jeruſalem, Epheſus, Corinth, Rome, Smyrna,</hi> and the reſt of the Scripture-Churches. I deny not but the Word <hi>Church</hi> may ſometimes in Scripture mean a particular Congregation, as when we read <hi>of a Church in a Houſe, Rom.</hi> 16.5. and ſo it might poſſibly mean in the Text he mentions, 1 Cor. 14.34. <hi>of Women ſpeaking in the Churches;</hi> tho' it ſeems
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003784_0096_10025B7391BD7930"/>
to me more probable this ought to be underſtood of the <hi>Places</hi> of Worſhip, like that, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Have ye not Houſes to Eat and Drink in, or deſpiſe ye the Church of GOD? i. e.</hi> the Place dedicated to his Worſhip. This inſtance therefore of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> that he brings, is ſo far from weakening, that it confirms what I contend for, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the ſame particular Church, there were ſeveral Congregations &amp; Places of Worſhip, while yet they were all called but one Church, as this Church is it ſelf ſtiled, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. of each Epiſtle, The <hi>Church</hi> that is at <hi>Corinth.</hi>— Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, therefore, to the Scripture-Style, we ſhould not ſay the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> notwithſtanding there are many Congregations and Places of Worſhip, which ſhould all be united under one Head as the Congregations of each Church in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times were which tho' they might be ſometimes called Churches, as we now-a-days call the Places of Worſhip, and particular Congregations, <hi>Churches,</hi> (meaning <hi>Pariſh-Churches,</hi>) yet, it is evident, from this very inſtance, that they were all in Scripture-Times called one Church, meaning a <hi>particular Church,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſeveral Congregations, under the Care of ſo many Presbyters, all united under one principal fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſon, at the Head of them; as the Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I ſay <hi>ordinarily</hi> all the Chriſtians of one City and Country adjacent, were a particular Church, and but one Biſhop preſided over each of them: Not that this was ever reckoned a neceſſary Rule, but what was judged moſt for the public Advantage always governed: Hence when two Cities were very near each other, they were united together under one Biſhop; and on the other Hand, when there was a large Country without any City in it, it was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſeveral Diſtricts, like Counties, the chief
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:003784_0097_10025BA2ED821DB0"/>
Town of which was the Biſhop's Seat. Thus in <hi>England, London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> being near each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make one Biſhoprick, and <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> another; otherwiſe there are juſt as many particular Churches &amp; Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> as there are Cities, according to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Model, and ſome large Countries had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Suffragans, of the ſame kind with the ancient <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> or Country Biſhops, and it would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be well if they were reſtored: However, as things are, the Number of Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> is ſo conſiderable, for ſo ſmall a Spot of Ground, that I think there is little Occaſion for Complaint. — As to Mr. <hi>Phileleuth</hi>'s ill-natured Flouts, and unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, indecent Reflections in <hi>p.</hi> 107, 8, 9, and 123. as well as many other places, I take no Notice of them: It is ſufficient to paſs them by with Pity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>And as to the Government of each particular Church, tho' he pretends to be ſo much at a loſs for my meaning, he knows well enough, that what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, is, that this is, and was always deemed to be eſſential to Epiſcopacy, that in each Diſtrict, be it a City, with it's adjacent Country, or a Chief Town with it's County, there be one chief Head or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ordain'd to that Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="97" facs="unknown:003784_0098_100203FFD13D96E8"/>
a mean Artifice of our Adverſaries, when we prove that ſuch a Perſon was always from the Beginning at the Head of the Clergy in each Church, to cry out. O, But thoſe <hi>ancient</hi> Biſhops were not of the ſame kind with our <hi>modern</hi> Biſhops: Why truly, we don't pretend that they were <hi>Lords,</hi> or had many other Temporal Privileges which Chriſtian Kings and Princes have ſince granted to Biſhops, or that there was always one preciſe Method in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Adminiſtrations; notwithſtanding theſe, and the like purely Circumſtantial Differences, we inſiſt upon it that our Biſhops are now of the ſame kind with thoſe <hi>ancient</hi> Biſhops, as to what was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ways eſſential to their Office and Character, be they called <hi>Prelates, Preſidents, Governours, Moderators,</hi> or what they will.</p>
            <p>Another Quibble that runs thro' this Gentleman's Performance, is, That thoſe primitive <hi>Biſhops</hi> were not of a <hi>different Order</hi> from the <hi>Presbyters.</hi>— To this I anſwer, That to me it ſeems a meer Strife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Words to object againſt calling them diſtinct Orders: However, If that would pleaſe him, I ſhould find no fault with Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Account of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Orders, which he himſelf quotes, <hi>p.</hi> 47. <q>That the Clergy be divided into two Orders, Presbyters and Deacons, and that of Presbyters, ſome be greater, ſome leſs in Power, and that by our Saviour's own Appointment.</q> Thus the whole Clergy of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church were <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> but the High Prieſt was never the leſs, by Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuperior to the other Prieſts. Let the Biſhop be a Presbyter if you pleaſe, according to this way of ſtating the Caſe: The Gentleman it ſeems likes a <hi>Dichotomy</hi> better than a <hi>Trich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tomy,</hi> let him have his Humour, ſo that the Truth of Things be not infringed. —The Reaſon why we call the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of a different Order from the <hi>Presbytery</hi> is, becauſe he is, &amp; always was
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:003784_0099_10025B78C4D51B38"/>
conſecrated or ordained to that Superiority of Station and Office, in ſolemn manner, by Impoſition of the Hands, either of the Apoſtles at firſt, as <hi>Timothy</hi> by <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 Ep. 1.6. or of other Biſhops afterwards, as is plain from many Paſſages in Antiquity, Vid. <hi>Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Origines. And for this Reaſon <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Arch-Deacons</hi> which he mentions, <hi>p.</hi> 58. are not <hi>different</hi> Orders, but of the <hi>ſame</hi> Order with the reſt of the Presbyters, becauſe they have no <hi>diſtinct</hi> Ordination from the reſt, as <hi>Biſhops</hi> have, and as <hi>Arch-Biſhops</hi> likewiſe have not from the other Biſhops, being both the one and the other, only <hi>primi inter pares,</hi> i. e. chief Men of the ſame Order with the reſt of their Brethren, only appointed to particular Buſineſſes of more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial Weight and Truſt.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole therefore, what we plead for is only this, That according to the Primitive Model, every Nation or Province be divided into ſeveral Diſtricts, conſiſting of a convenient Number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, each immediately under the Care of their ſeveral Presbyters, and all united under one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Perſon at the Head of them: Such as thoſe were, whom the Apoſtles at firſt ordained, one in each City, wherever they prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> manner, that nothing might be regularly done by the Clergy, without him at the Head of them —This I ſay, is what we plead for, and for this we appeal to the Facts of the Holy Scriptures, and the moſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches.— Thus, in Fact the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> with it's Presbytery and People were under the Government of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and that of <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now, as to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> this Gentleman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that they had, one the Care of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the other of all the Cities in <hi>Crete,</hi> and therefore they could not be fixed Biſhops of particular Churches: As if theſe were inconſiſtent the one with the other. They might have, and, if we will believe the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Ancients, they had a Primacy and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Inſpection over the Biſhops, and all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in thoſe Parts, tho' they had a particular fixed Juriſdiction each one in his own particular Church: <hi>Timothy</hi> had manifeſtly a Jurisdiction over the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as appears from the Epiſtles to him; and all that <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s Teſtimony can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be ſuppoſed to imply is that he had a Primacy and general Inſpection with regard to the reſt of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> each of which had it's Angel or Biſhop beſides, as is clear from St. <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtles to them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3.— And where I beſeech you, is the Inconſiſtency of ſuppoſing a Succeſſion of ſuch fixed Governors of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the reſt of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as in Fact they were, and St. <hi>John</hi>'s ſettling at <hi>Epheſus</hi> in the Decline of Life (which he makes ſuch adoe abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency in all this with what I plead for; and this Suppoſition renders the Teſtimonies of the Ancients all conſiſtent with one another. He brings a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> againſt me, who ſays, <q>He cannot find in any Writer of the three firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, any intimation, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were fixed Biſhops</q>. But does not the Gentleman deal very unfairly in leaving the Matter thus, when Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>'s next Words are, <q>That this Defect is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplied by the Concurrent Suffrages of the 4th and 5th Centuries?</q> And does he not next quote <hi>Euſebius,</hi> (who indeed lived in the third Century,) and who ſays, <q>it was delivered down to them by Hiſtory, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Crete</hi>
               </q>. From whence it is manifeſt, tho' thoſe Hiſtories are now loſt, that ſuch were then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; and the Doctor quotes many others that atteſt to the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>act.—It is true, Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> has a Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is almoſt peculiar to himſelf, and which I don't ſee to be ſufficiently ſupported by the Reaſons he gives; however afterwards he abundantly proves <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to have been truly Biſhops, tho' he is ſomewhat doubtful about their having a fixed Charge in any particular Church; and that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy was truly an Apoſtolical Conſtitution, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates in a moſt unanſwerable manner in that Preface to the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> where among other

Inſtances he mentions the <hi>Angels</hi> of the 7 Churches as undoubted Biſhops, and ſays, <q>There can be no ſtronger Proof of ſuch a Matter of Fact, than the general and concurrent Practice of the Chriſtian Church in the Ages next ſucceeding the Apoſtles; and this general Senſe of the Chriſtian Church may be demonſtrated</q>. And then goes on with his Demonſtration, and among others he alledges the Arguments of Bp. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> as unanſwerable, whom, Mr. <hi>Philele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Only he pretends this don't prove them to be of a different and ſuperiour Order: To which I need ſay no more than what I have already ſaid, only I think it is plain enough, that, even in Governments, ever ſo well ballanced and limited the diſtinction between <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Governed,</hi> is ſufficient to denominate them of different Orders.</p>

So inconſiſtent are falſe Schemes one with another, as well as with Truth! — That <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Biſhops had the ſole Power of Ordination is manifeſt, not only from the Canon abovementioned, but alſo from hence, that there is not one Inſtance to be given, in all Antiquity, of any other approved Ordinations, but what were performed by Biſhops, as Mr. <hi>Bingham</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly proves,<hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. §. 6. and I challenge one Inſtance to be produced. — And laſtly, That <hi>Ignatius</hi> held Epiſcopacy to be Fundamental, is clear from many Paſſages, particularly <hi>Ep. ad Eph.</hi> §. 3. where he ſays, that <q>the Biſhops appointed unto the utmoſt Bounds of the Earth are by the Will of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>

            <p>And now as to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Teſtimonies, who lived within 150 Years of the Apoſtles: I muſt have the Charity to believe, that this Gentleman never

That St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſtyles the Biſhops his <hi>Colleagues,</hi> but never gives that Appellation to the Presbyters: And this Diſtinction is abundantly evident thro'out the whole of his Writings.

well as many other Places. In the 35th <hi>Ep</hi> he gives his Clergy an Account of his having ordained <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midicus</hi> Presbyter, and calls them, <hi>"his Clergy":</hi> and in that, and <hi>Ep.</hi> 38. he ſpeaks of Eccleſiaſtical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions as depending on the Biſhop; can theſe and the like Expreſſions be reconciled with the Character of a modern Moderator of a Presbytery?— In <hi>Ep.</hi> 39. he tells them "he had ſuſpended or cenſured ſuch and ſuch Perſons".— In <hi>Ep.</hi> 69. he ſays, <q>The Biſhops ſucceed the Apoſtles by vicarious Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</q> and calls them "<hi>Governours</hi> of the Church", as he alſo does in the Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and in <hi>Ep.</hi> 76. he makes a Regular <q>Succeſſion from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles neceſſary to a lawful Ordination</q>, and the ſame does <hi>Firmilian,</hi> Ep. 75. — But it would be endleſs to mention all the Paſſages in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> that explain the Nature of the Epiſcopacy of thoſe Times, as being manifeſtly of the kind we plead for. I wiſh the Reader could at leaſt conſult theſe, and that he would readily ſee how far this Gentleman is from giving a fair and juſt Repreſentation of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Senſe.— Nothing can be more evident from the whole of his Conduct with reſpect to his Presbyters, than that he had, and exerciſed a proper, tho' limited Jurisdiction or Government over them; and yet this unaccountable Gentleman would face down the good old Father and the whole Primitive Chriſtian World, That his, and all the ancient Epiſcopacy was only a meer Primacy.</p>
            <p>Well, But he undertakes to prove this from St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> himſelf; who, in his Tract <hi>De unitate Eccleſiae,</hi> makes the Primacy of <hi>Peter</hi> with reſpect to the reſt of the Apoſtles who were of the ſame Order with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a Pattern for all ſucceeding Biſhops.

Unity, he uſes this, That as the Apoſtolate was one, each Apoſtle having the whole Authority of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Apoſtolate; ſo the Epiſcopate which ſuccceds it, is but One each Biſhop having the whole Authority of the Epiſcopate: But as the Unity of the Apoſtolate centered in the Primacy of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo he would have the Unity of the Epiſcopate center in the Primacy of One in each Province, which Primacy is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the 6th Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as an <hi>ancient Cuſtom,</hi> and as having univerſally obtained in the Church: See Bp. <hi>Fell</hi>'s Notes <hi>in loc.</hi> — And agreeably to this Senſe of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> pleads, <q>That all Biſhops have the ſame Power, whether the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> or of <hi>Eugubium,</hi> whether they be great or ſmall, rich or poor? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are all alike Succeſſors of the Apoſtles</q>: And yet he would have a Primacy among them, as appears from the Paſſage this Gentleman refers to. — All that can be gathered from the Paſſages, therefore, is, that all Biſhops are equal, as all the Apoſtles were to whom they ſucceed; but does it therefore follow, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, Biſhops and Presbyters are equal? By no means, for they are not ſpeaking a word in thoſe Places of Presbyters: — They would have a Primacy in each Province among the Biſhops, as <hi>Peter</hi> was Primate among the Apoſtles: but does it therefore follow that the Biſhop has only a Primacy among the Presbyters? No ſuch thing, for neither of them ever ſpeak of Presbyters as being the proper Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Apoſtles. — This Gentleman there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does manifeſtly pervert the true Senſe of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> in underſtanding them to mean that the ancient Biſhops had only a Primacy with reſpect to the Presbyters, juſt as St. <hi>Peter</hi> had with regard to the other Apoſtles: for they are not ſpeaking a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable in thoſe Places of the Biſhop with reſpect to his Presbytery, but of the Biſhops among themſelves; neither is St <hi>Cyprian</hi> there ſpeaking of the Unity of
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:003784_0112_10025B9948691380"/>
a particular Church, but of the Catholick Church; and maintains, as I have ſaid, that as there is one Apoſtolate, of which each Apoſtle had the whole Power, ſo there is one Epiſcopate, of which each Biſhop has the whole Power! Never does he once ſpeak thus of Presbyters, tho' he very often mentions them, but ever ſpeaks of them as being diſtinct from Biſhops, and inferior and ſubject to them: But as there was a Primacy in the Apoſtolate; ſo he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpeaks of a Primacy in the Epiſcopate in each Province, but never does he ſpeek of this in regard to the Presbytery.—He himſelf was Primate or Arch-Biſhop of the Province of <hi>Africa,</hi> and preſided in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in which, beſide many Presbyters and Deacons, there were 87 Biſhops of that Country: on which Occaſion, he ſays, <q>None of us takes upon him to be a <hi>Biſhop of Biſhops.</hi>
               </q> i. e. To exerciſe a proper Jurisdiction over other Biſhops: In this conſiſted the Papal Uſurpation afterwards, turning the <hi>Primacy</hi> into a Supremacy, and the Spiritual into a Worldly Dominion: This St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> diſclames, (as did even <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> above 300 Years after this:) But it is evident from his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, that he was at the ſame time a <hi>Biſhop of Presbyters,</hi> and did exerciſe a proper, tho' limited Jurisdiction or Government over the Presbyters, Deacons and People of his own particular Church of <hi>Carthage.</hi>— And now I appeal to every unprejudiced Reader, whether I have not truly and juſtly repreſented his Senſe, and the Senſe of thoſe Primitive Times, and conſequently whether this Gentleman hath not groſly miſrepreſented it.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is formed exactly according to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Model as to all the particulars I have been mentioning: Does he make all the Apoſtles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in Power with St. <hi>Peter?</hi> So are all our Biſhops equal in Power with the Archbiſhops, except what a meer Primacy for Order nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Peter</hi> a Primacy with reſpect to the other Apoſtles? So have our Archbiſhops with reſpect to the other Biſhops, and as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> likewiſe had with reſpect to the other Biſhops of <hi>Affrica.</hi> — Did the Unity of the Primitive Church, as to its common Polity, center in this Primacy? So does the Unity of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> — Had St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s &amp; <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Biſhops each of them Presbyters under them, and a limited Juriſdiction over the Clergy, as well as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, each one in his own Church? So have the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>England</hi> each in his, and only a limited Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction: —The Biſhops of thoſe Times alone ordained, and ſo do ours, excepting that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with us aſſiſt in ordaining Presbyters, and ſo they probably did then. Some circumſtantial Difference there may be, but the Subſtance, or moſt material Points of Eccleſiaſtical Government, are the ſame.— Upon the whole, I can truly ſay, I deſire no other kind of Biſhops than ſuch as were in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time; and if I did not ſincerely think that thoſe of our Church were manifeſtly of the ſame kind with them, I would immediately drop my Pen, and never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to plead her Cauſe any more.</p>
            <p>But before I finiſh, I muſt beg leave to obſerve, That this Gentleman ſeems, after all, not unwilling to own that the <hi>Cyprianic,</hi> and even the <hi>Ignatian</hi> Biſhops, (nay, and even <hi>Timothy, Titus</hi> and the 7 Angels themſelves, were at leaſt <hi>fixed Moderators, p.</hi> 127, 128, 152, And for ought I can ſee, his Argument from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy muſt make them fixed by <hi>Divine Appointment:</hi> By which I think he muſt be allowed to grant that the way of theſe <hi>New-England</hi> Churches, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians, are not conformed to the Primitive Model, as eſtabliſhed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for it is well known that theirs are only vague Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and choſen <hi>pro re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ata.</hi> — Now ſeeing he is come ſo near to us, as not only to allow that thoſe whom we call Primitive Biſhops might be fixed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:003784_0114_10025B9DA494F998"/>
or fixed Preſidents, as in fact they were, and ſeems not to diſlike this Conſtitution; methinks it is pity we ſhould differ any longer. Let him only grant two Things more, which the Primitive Model certainly alſo requires, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe fixed Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents be ordained to their Office with Impoſition of Hands, by thoſe of their own Order, and That no Act of Ordination and Government be allowed but under their Preſidency: Nay, rather than fail, let it be ſo limited, if he pleaſes, as that the Preſident ſhall no more be allowed to do any thing of Moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <hi>Presbytery,</hi> than They without him; I ſay let theſe things be granted, and we will be at once uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, and all be one Communion again.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude: As to the Buſineſs of <hi>Charity,</hi> I muſt think my Brother <hi>Phil.</hi> hath not conſidered the Expreſſions I uſed, (which he will needs have to be inconſiſtent with both It and Themſelves) with that Candor and Charity he might and ought to have done. — For GOD's ſake, my Brethren, Let us not, for the Future, ſtudy to put the worſt Conſtructions we can on one anothers Words or Actions; but let us rather endeavour to make the beſt we can of them: Let us not try to magnifie and aggravate the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between us, but rather to make as little of them, and to conſider them with as much Tenderneſs, as poſſible: Let us not diſpute which has already moſt or leaſt Charity, but let us ſtrive to ſee who ſhall hereafter, really and in fact, moſt abound in the Practice of that Heavenly Vertue, both towards each other, and towards all Men: This is the beſt Courſe we can take, as far as poſſible in this imperfect State, to reconcile our ſelves to one another, both in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Practice; to meet together in Truth, and live in Peace here, or however to meet at laſt in that perfect State of Truth, and Peace, and Holineſs hereafter, where GOD and Charity alone ſhall forever Reign!</p>
