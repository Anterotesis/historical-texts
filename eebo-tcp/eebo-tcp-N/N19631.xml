            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS is a part of a remarkably full and clear prophecy of the Meſſiah. The ſacred hiſtorians ſcarcely write on his incarnation, life, ſufferings and death, with greater perſpicuity and preciſion, than the evangelic prophet. Theſe beautifully plaintive words are quoted by the evangeliſt John, and the apoſtle Paul, who inform us they were originally addreſſed to God, and had immediate reference to Chriſt's rejection by the Jewiſh nation. By this report, or <hi>doctrine,</hi> as the marginal reading is, taken in a large ſenſe, may be deſigned the inſpired writings in general, or the whole ſubject of the goſpel miniſtry; but in the ſtrict accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it relates immediately to the ſcheme of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, and calls our particular attention to his incarnation, ſufferings and death. The truth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of natural religion, have rarely been called in queſtion, but who has believed the report in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation? This ſome <hi>reject,</hi> and others ſtill leſs ingenuous, <hi>wreſt</hi> to their own deſtruction. The preaching of the croſs, or the ſublime, yet unpopular doctrine of the bible, is to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs; but to us who are ſaved, it is, inſtrumentally, the power of God. Our text implies, that God has ſome faithful miniſters among men, who call on his name, and are concerned for his glory, to whom he has committed a report, or ſyſtem of doctrines, ſufficiently authenticated, which they plainly, fully, and conſiſtently declare; and which thoſe to whom it is addreſſed are bound to believe, according to the nature and degree of evidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; but that, from ſome cauſe, they are lamentably incredulous. Theſe propoſitions compoſe a foundation, on which might be ſhewn the characteriſtics of goſpel miniſters, the contents of their report, the evidence of its authenticity, the motives inducing a declaration of the whole divine counſel, the nature, kind, degrees,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025616_0004_0FCE9C8A90E2AD78"/>
grounds, uſe, objects of, and obligations to faith; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the cauſes and conſequences of unbelief: But your time on the preſent intereſting occaſion will not admit, and my feeble talents are very unequal for the conſideration of theſe important things at large. I ſhall only attempt, as the Lord may aſſiſt,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A brief recital and illuſtration of the leading doctrines of our faith, reported in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhew of whom, and the grounds on which, faith is required in our goſpel report, conſidered as it reſpects the whole of divine revelation. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to anſwer a few of the moſt plauſible and popular objections againſt this ſcheme.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I am to attempt a brief recital and illuſtration of the leading doctrines of our faith as reported in the goſpel. The very foundation of revealed religion, which ſtands with diſtinguiſhed glory and luſtre, is the ſacred and myſterious doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity. This,</p>
            <p>Firſt, demands our moſt ſerious and devout attention. That there is a God, is as evident as that there is an univerſe. Deity is inſcribed in glaring and indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters on every object. And that there is, and can be but one God, is alſo evinced by reaſon. But for the knowledge of three diſtinct perſons in the indiviſible God Head, we are wholy indebted to revelation. This is confeſſedly a great myſtery. But how can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as it reſpects the mode of the incomprehenſible Jehovah's exiſtence? With ſubmiſſion, I conceive all endeavours to elucidate it (to ſay the leaſt) are unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. One juſtly obſerves, "That reaſon never ſhews itſelf more reaſonable, than when it ceaſes to reaſon about things above reaſon." This peculiarly abſtruſe point, upon God's authority, demands our unreſerved faith, with the moſt profound adoration and awe. It was ſtated and maintained with an energy and evidence divinely glorious at Chriſt's baptiſm, and is forcibly inculcated every time that ſacred ordinance is adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Simon Magus held, that the Father, Son, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025616_0005_0FCE9C8C1F494ED0"/>
Spirit, are only characters of one perſon conſidered in different points of view, or according to his different manner of operation. But the admiſſion of this idea would render all the ſcriptures that relate to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſubject, unintelligible and abſurd. The Three that bare record in Heaven, and whom we worſhip as the one eternal God, are <hi>perſons,</hi> to whom all the attributes of Deity are indiſcriminately applicable. This glorious peculiarity of revealed religion, is denied, oppoſed and rediculed by Arians, Socinians, and Deiſts, of every deſcription. 'Tis what theſe <hi>rationaliſts,</hi> as they are fond to be called, with all their erudition and ſagacity cannot apprehend, and their prepoſterous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, therefore it is falſe and abſurd. But theſe black epithets, upon the ſame principle, may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon many of the moſt ſtubborn facts. When our learned opponents explain the union betwixt their own bodies and minds, and ſhew how any being can exiſt without a cauſe, or be the cauſe of its own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, we ſhall pay an implicit deference to their other logical deciſions. But at preſent, we deem it highly rational to believe the account God has plainly given of himſelf, however incomprehenſible by us. His know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, alſo, is too wonderful for us; yet we muſt believe and confeſs,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That his underſtanding is infinite. The ſublime doctrine of divine fore-knowledge, is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of our invaluable report. The ancient veterans of Jeſus Chriſt, in the cauſe of God and truth, uſed it with happy and never-failing ſucceſs, in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing all ſyſtems that taught, or implied contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as applied to God. Their moſt acute and powerful adverſaries could neither evade nor withſtand the force of arguments properly drawn from this ſource: And all advocates for the invincible ſyſtem of eternal truth, may ever avail themſelves of this reſiſtleſs and divine weapon. Some have the daring effrontery to deny God's fore knowledge of the free volitions of moral agents, which, in my judgment (one attribute
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025616_0006_0FCE9C8D9A3580D0"/>
of Deity being as perfect as another) is the ſame in effect, as to deny his being infinitely juſt. But from the higheſt authority, we know that his wiſdom is illimitted. "He looks to the ends of the earth, and ſees under the whole Heaven." And the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſcernment that penetrates the moſt ſecret receſſes of immenſity <hi>now,</hi> intimately pervades all the dark intricacies of <hi>futurity.</hi> "His eyes are in every place, beholding the evil and the good;" and both good and evil, as they originate in, and proceed from the heart. "He fills Heaven and earth, and knows the thoughts of the mind afar off." Not only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but the moſt remote thought. "Hell and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are," and were from eternity, "naked before him: How much more the hearts," and all the free volitions, "of the children of men?" There can be nothing concealed in the moſt diſtant and darkeſt gloom, from the only wiſe God, with whom the light dwells. Theſe, and many other ſimilar aſſertions, with which the ſcriptures abound, have all been demonſtrated by his fore-telling, particularly, at the diſtance of ages, a multitude of deep and intricate events, depending for their exiſtence, on the free volitions of moral agents. And if God's knowledge of that which to us is future, is perfect; and who can ſay it is not, all the objects of it, or events foreſeen, muſt be from ſome cauſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary. That which to us is paſt, and cannot be otherwiſe, can be no more certain as it reſpects God, than all that is yet to come. With him, the <hi>future</hi> is as the <hi>preſent</hi> and the <hi>paſt.</hi> Well might an adoring apoſtle exclaim, O the depth of the riches of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God! It is true, fore-knowledge has no influence on its ſubjects; yet all muſt grant, that their exiſtence, by <hi>ſome means,</hi> is made as certain and inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as the knowledge that comprehends them, is clear and infallible. No mathematical axiom can be more ſelf-evident, than that <hi>certain</hi> fore-knowledge has an indiſſoluble connection with that which is <hi>certainly</hi> fore-known. He who will not allow this, can deny, that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025616_0007_0FCE9C8F0ED54D60"/>
"Things equal to one and the ſame thing, are equal to one another." With the ſame variety and ſtrength of evidence, the divine oracles declare,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The exiſtence of an eternal, determinate and <hi>untruſtrable counſel,</hi> the evolution of which will not be effected by leſs than the conſummation of all things; nor prior to that period. God's ſovereign and eternal will, being infinitely free to form his wonderful plan of operations, by effecting and permitting, as ſeemed good in his own ſight; this is properly and emphatically called, "THE COUNSEL OF HIS OWN WILL." "A decree is declared: The decree of the Moſt High, which ſhall not paſs."</p>
            <p>And what can be more rationally ſuppoſed, than that God would not begin to act without propoſing a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and important end? And to deviſe and ſecure all the means leading <hi>to,</hi> and inſeparably connected <hi>with</hi> its accompliſhment, was equally eligible and neceſſary. God's ultimate end in all his works, of nature, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and grace, was neither the happineſs nor miſery of any, or all his creatures, but his own declarative glory. "He made all things for himſelf." And this important truth extending its influence to all parts of the divine ſyſtem with which it is connected, merits the ſtricteſt attention; many ſcriptures and diſpenſations being inexplicable without the reflection of its rays. Though there is no diſtinction betwixt the preſcience and counſel of God, as immanent acts of the divine mind, in order of <hi>time,</hi> both being eternal, yet <hi>this</hi> was <hi>prior</hi> to <hi>that</hi> in order of <hi>nature.</hi> God did not foreſee the events of time, and their final iſſue, falling out <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitouſly</hi> as <hi>ſome:</hi> or by an undeſigning <hi>fatality,</hi> as <hi>others</hi> ſuppoſe, and decree accordingly; but with ſovereign freedom and infinite ſkill, he drew his inimitable plan; and as the effect of his righteous and immutable decrees, foreſaw its happy and exact execution. The admirable chain of providence reſpecting man, has been let down for enough to diſcover a deſign, too grand and conſiſtent to be dependent on the giddy and claſhing volitions of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025616_0008_0FCE9C9093A845B8"/>
ſhort-ſighted mortals. Had they been all left to their ſinful propenſities, expoſed to the violence of their own baſe and turbulent paſſions; without reſtraint, or quickening and directing influence from on high, the inevitable reſult muſt have been, their univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Blind <hi>chance</hi> is as incompetent to the government of the <hi>moral,</hi> as it would have been to the formation of the <hi>natural</hi> world. God's providence is univerſal and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. To anſwer his wiſe and holy purpoſes, he <hi>effects</hi> the good which exiſts, <hi>permits</hi> the evil, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains</hi> the reſt. And as the moſt minute incident may have an aſtoniſhing influence on a long ſeries of intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diſpenſations, <hi>all things</hi> were made the ſubject of divine determination. There is an indiſſoluble conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination betwixt things more diſtant and diſproportioned, than the extremes of time; or the fall of a ſparrow and the revolution of a kingdom. "The very hairs of our heads are numbered." Thoſe who grant this, are prepared,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To contemplate, with awful and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reverence, the ſtupendous diſplays of God's ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, electing and eternal love. This incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible love, is the moſt intereſting animating, and delightful theme, that ever exerciſed a created mind. Love is an eſſential attribute of the divine nature. "God is love." His love, like himſelf, is without beginning or end. He has loved all the objects of his preſent favor, with an everlaſting love. He is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. But his love to his redeemed is ſpecial, without the leaſt imaginable injury to the reſt of his creatures. It is with reſpect to this ſpecial love, that thoſe who are not the objects of it, are repreſented in holy writ, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively hated, without the conſideration of their having done either good or evil.</p>
            <p>But even <hi>theſe</hi> have great reaſon to be thankful; and are highly culpable in having an evil eye, a murmuring heart, or a caviling tongue, becauſe their bountiful
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025616_0009_0FCE9C92409D6CC8"/>
benefactor is tranſcendantly good to others. Let the creature who has not received as much as it deſerves, demand a recompence of God. But if he is indebted to none, let him without cenſure, do what he will with his own. When he was pleaſed to ſet up Chriſt in the office of mediator, as head of all principalities and powers, who had a right to be diſſatisfied at being left to occupy an inferior ſphere? God's ſetting up his only begotten ſon from everlaſting, could do no ſhadow of injury to any, while it was infinitely advantageous to innumerable millions. For he was choſen as a head, and with reference to a body, which was accordingly choſen in him, irreſpective of works of righteouſneſs, from eternity. And who among the non elect, God having dealt bountifully with them, could ſay that they were wronged in not being made to ſhare the ſtill richer communications of his exuberant goodneſs, and the manifeſtations of his ſpecial love. Were complaints, on the ſcore of an unequal diſtribution of the divine bounty juſt, there would be matter of univerſal murmuring. Every ſpecies of inferior creatures might repine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not a ſuperior link in the chain of <hi>being,</hi> from the meaneſt animalcule, to the flaming <hi>ſeraph; who,</hi> likewiſe, diſſatisfied with finite powers, might aſpire at deity.</p>
            <p>But the ingratitude, pride, and rebellious ambition, that prompt to ſuch daring impiety, and a conduct ſo dreadfully perilous, muſt ever furniſh ſad monuments of ſignal vengeance. The order of the viſible and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſubordination which exiſts among the creatures, ſhall never be violated. God's chooſing a certain and definite number from among men <hi>in,</hi> and giving them as a portion, and charge <hi>to</hi> Chriſt, as their glorious head and repreſentative, rendered the condition of others, by no means worſe than the law of their creation had made it. God was under no obligation to elect any man, or election was of debt contrary to ſcripture; and conſequently he had an indiſputable right to paſs over whom he pleaſed. The fulfilling of no future
<pb n="10"
                   facs="unknown:025616_0010_0FCE9C96AE015FD0"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
conditions by the creatures, induced God's choice; nor were <hi>characters,</hi> but <hi>perſons,</hi> the objects of it. Men are not elected becauſe converted; but converted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe elected. Faith and obedience are not cauſes, or conditions, but fruits and evidences of election. The elect being loved with an everlaſting love, they are drawn with loving kindneſs. They were choſen to holineſs, as well <hi>as,</hi> and in order <hi>to</hi> happineſs. They were choſen to ſalvation through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth. "Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt," ſays the ſeraphic Paul, "who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt, according as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love. He hath ſaved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began." And whom he thus fore-knew, we are to obſerve,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, "He alſo did <hi>predeſtinate</hi> to the adoption of ſons. The elect are "Predeſtinated to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt, in whom they have obtained an inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will." Men are not ordained to eternal life becauſe they <hi>believe;</hi> but as many as are <hi>ordained,</hi> or <hi>predeſtinated</hi> to eternal life, <hi>believe.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, taken in its largeſt ſenſe, has all creatures and events for its objects in a certain ſenſe; but that branch of it which reſpects the elect, is well defined by the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> article of the Engliſh national church, in the following words: "Predeſtination to life is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the world were laid, he hath conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, by his counſel, ſecret to us, to deliver from curſe and damnation, thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt out of mankind, and to bring them by Chriſt to everlaſting ſalvation, as veſſels made to honor." After
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025616_0011_0FCE9C981910B7B0"/>
theſe authorities, it would be ſuperfluous to add any thing more on this head. As election ſuppoſes refuſing, or paſſing by ſome; ſo predeſtination to life, as <hi>ſome</hi> are finally loſt, leads us</p>
            <p>Sixthly, To conſider the particular decree that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects <hi>them.</hi> "If our goſpel be hid," ſays St Paul, it is hid to them that are loſt." And we learn by St. Peter, that there are ſome, "Who ſtumble at the word, being diſobedient, whereunto alſo they were appointed." Theſe are they "Whoſe names were not within the book of life from the foundation of the world." The decree which juſtly appointed them to wrath is called reprobation. We read of ſome ſtiled <hi>reprobate</hi> ſilver, and of others, who concerning good works were <hi>reprobate.</hi> The word in both theſe places ſignifies adulterated, or counterfeit. In this ſenſe, God never reprobated any man. Men have reprobated and ruined themſelves. Though eternal life is God's gift, through Jeſus Chriſt, without reſpect to any merit in the heirs of it; eternal death is the juſt wages of ſin. God never puniſhes any man unleſs he deſerves it; and then only in exact proportion to his demerit. Man has no one to blame for his reprobation and deſtruction, but himſelf. Reprobation, as it is God's act, does indeed ſignify, abandoning to eternal miſery; but it is for infinite and voluntary offences againſt his royal law and authority. All men act with the natural liberty of the will, and are worthy of praiſe and blame, gracious reward, and righteous puniſhment according to their works. "Whatſoever a man ſows, that ſhall he alſo reap." Some divide reprobation into preterition and predamnation. Preterition found and left the non-elect like the reſt of the human race, doing them neither good nor harm; and predamnation was their righteous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment unto wrath, for their foreſeen wickedneſs. A creature is never ſent to hell, the bedlam of the univerſe, <hi>as a creature,</hi> or while it is fit for any other place. Damnation is of the ſinner. All the damned are veſſels of wrath, fitted by their God provoking ſins,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025616_0012_0FCE9C9C4122C198"/>
for deſtruction. Theſe are the ungodly men, who, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> were before of old, ordained to this condemnation. And it was undeniably as juſt, upon perfect foreſight of their ſins, to <hi>predetermine,</hi> as it is actually to <hi>inflict</hi> their damnation. "I cannot think," ſays that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently great and good man, preſident Davies, "that the events of time, or the judicial proceſs of the laſt day, will furniſh God with any new intelligence to enable him to determine the final ſtates of men more juſtly than he could from eternity." The non elect were left to enjoy common gifts, bleſſings and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, in a providential way; but eventually to periſh in and for their ſins. From this awful truth, permit me to call your attention,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, To the covenant of redemption. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the elect were ſecured by covenant. God made a covenant with his choſen, ordered in all things and ſure. It was between the eternal Three, in behalf of the elect: Proviſion was made in this eternal contract to effect their recovery from the dire effects of the fall, in a way that would manifeſt, magnify, and do infinite honor to every divine perfection. The righteous law of God was viewed as ſhamefully violated, and divine juſtice, as thereby infinitely injured. Men were viewed as depraved, guilty, helpleſs and condemned creatures, without the leaſt inclination or ability to ſatisfy for their offences or to return to God. Now God could not deny himſelf. He would by no means, as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver and judge, acquit the guilty. He would not agree for grace to reign but through righteouſneſs; or to juſtify the ungodly, unleſs he could do it juſtly; juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice being eſſential to the divine character.</p>
            <p>And though he might have exacted ſatisfaction of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bankrupts themſelves, he not only <hi>admitted,</hi> but exerciſed his wiſdom goodneſs and mercy in <hi>providing</hi> a ſurety in the perſon of his own Son. The Father was to prepare him a true body and a rational ſoul, through the agency of the Holy Spirit, of the nature of man the tranſgreſſor, which in the fulneſs of time,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025616_0013_0FCE9C9D80B584C0"/>
he was to take into an inſeparable union with the divine nature, as it exiſted in his perſon, that he might be a ſuitable mediator between God and man. In this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity he ſtipulated to magnify and make honorable the law, by a perſonal obedience adequate to all its exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive requiſitions; and to ſatisfy the utmoſt demands of juſtice, by the ſacrifice of his ſoul and body in the room and ſtead of his people, whoſe tranſgreſſions were all accordingly imputed to, or laid upon him. He then, as their covenant-head, received in their behalf, all the great and precious promiſes which enrich and adorn the inſpired volume; together with all gifts, graces and heavenly bleſſings that were to be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon, and applied to the whole church, by the divine ſpirit. And the ſacred compact was ratified by oaths, promiſes and blood. By this eternal contract the travel of Chriſt's ſoul was ſecured: Hence, "He ſhall ſee his ſeed, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand." Of the accompliſhment of this, there can be no reaſonable doubt, when it is conſidered.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That redemption by Chriſt, as it reſpects the ſatisfaction of juſtice, is finiſhed and compleat. All who were choſen in, and given to him, he covenanted in behalf <hi>of,</hi> and obeyed, ſuffered and died <hi>for,</hi> to put an end to their tranſgreſſions, and bring in for them an everlaſting righteouſneſs. For theſe <hi>many,</hi> for this <hi>all,</hi> he gave his life a ranſom. This is the church he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his blood. And for <hi>theſe,</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the world, he intercedes. <hi>Theſe</hi> are the ranſomed of the Lord, who ſhall return to Zion with ſongs and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joy. <hi>Theſe</hi> are redeemed from <hi>among</hi> men, <hi>out of</hi> every tongue and kindred and people; and, as a conſequence, waſhed in the blood of the Lamb. Chriſt will accompliſh his whole undertaking. It never ſhall be truly ſaid of him, "He began to build, but was not able to finiſh." If he undertook, <hi>abſolutely,</hi> to ſave the whole human race, there is nothing but change of mind, or want of power, neither of which can be aſcribed to him, that can hinder an univerſal ſalvation;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025616_0014_0FCE9C9ECAABA0E0"/>
which does not, however, appear to be the doctrine contained in the oracles of God. If he ſatisfied <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally</hi> for <hi>all</hi> the ſins of <hi>all</hi> men, not a <hi>ſoul</hi> in juſtice can be damned. But if he only ſatisfied for <hi>part</hi> of the ſins of all men, however <hi>conſiderable</hi> a part that might be, they will have to anſwer for the <hi>other part,</hi> and there being an infinite evil in the <hi>leaſt</hi> ſin, not a ſoul can be ſaved. If Chriſt did not ſatisfy for <hi>unbelief,</hi> as well as other ſins, all unbelievers muſt neceſſarily be loſt, nothing having the efficacy to cleanſe from ſin, but his invaluable blood.</p>
            <p>From which it evidently appears, that either Chriſt did not ſatisfy for their ſins who are finally loſt, or that men may periſh everlaſtingly for the <hi>very</hi> tranſgreſſions to which he put an end by the vicarious ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And if this is a poſſible caſe, I beg leave to aſk, what <hi>beſides</hi> the death of Chriſt, is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to keep a ſoul from condemnation. If the merits of Chriſt alone are not ſufficient to reſt upon for ſalvation, what in addition to them <hi>is,</hi> ſhould doubtleſs be preciſely aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. It is ſaid, that he undertook to ſave men <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally;</hi> but if he only undertook to ſave thoſe who are finally loſt upon <hi>conditions</hi> which he knew would eventually <hi>never</hi> be fulfilled, he in fact never deſigned their ſalvation <hi>at all</hi> and conſequently did not die, nor intercede for them. His life was infinitely too dear to lay down at uncertainties; much leſs for the ſalvation of thoſe whom he knew would be <hi>finally loſt;</hi> and leaſt of all for thoſe who <hi>were</hi> loſt already when he died. It appears that he obeyed, ſuffered and died for the elect only, who are called accordingly, by invincible grace, out of darkneſs into light, juſtified by his righteouſneſs imputed to them, ſanctified by his grace implanted in them, and kept by divine power, through faith unto ſalvation. Admoniſhed by my aſſigned limits, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</p>
            <p>Secondly. To ſhew <hi>of whom,</hi> and the grounds on <hi>which</hi> faith is required in our report, conſidered as it reſpects the whole of divine revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:025616_0015_0FCE9CA044E3F400"/>Firſt, I am to ſhew of whom this faith is required. It will doubtleſs be attended with little difficulty to prove, if a <hi>negative</hi> may be admitted, that faith is never required without information and teſtimony. All agree that a revelation is not made to many who are loſt; and yet ſome ſay that no man is condemned but for <hi>unbelief.</hi> But how can it be ſuppoſed, that a perſon who never heard, or obtained knowledge of our report, by any means, can be concerned with it as an object of faith? That <hi>faith</hi> through the powerful influence of the Holy Spirit may virtually, or eſſentially exiſt, without the uſe of external means, and ſo produce the ſalvation of the ſubjects of it, is readily allowed; but that even <hi>this</hi> is required without being <hi>produced,</hi> much leſs the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it, muſt be denied. A man can be under no obligation to <hi>believe,</hi> without a <hi>revelation:</hi> An angel in Heaven is incapable of this. For faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing by the word of God, in the manner effects are produced by their cauſe. Objects may exiſt without any connection with, or relation to <hi>faith;</hi> but faith cannot exiſt without reference to an <hi>object,</hi> real or underſtood, and an object <hi>revealed.</hi> Facts muſt really or poſſibly exiſt, to become objects of faith; then they muſt be revealed, and the revelation requires, and can only produce a faith according to its own nature. Faith never puts its object into exiſtence, as ſome have abſurdly repreſented, and facts are true whether they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or not. Some <hi>confeſs,</hi> that an hiſtorical faith without information, or a ſaving faith, with a merely external revelation, is more than man can produce; but they argue that his ability in his preſent ſtate, is not the ſtandard of his duty, and that God juſtly requires that of him now, which, through his own voluntarly contracted depravity, he cannot perform.</p>
            <p>But though, in a <hi>qualified</hi> ſenſe, we grant this, it will not follow, that God will require any thing inequit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or unreaſonable of his creatures, as that unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably would be, for which he never gave them a capacity. And it is evident, that man in his primoeval
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025616_0016_0FCE9CA8805D2F78"/>
ſtate, had no power to believe without a revelation. And how can it be ſuppoſed, I ſpeak with reverence, according to our ideas of juſtice, that that can be juſtly required of man, to which his nature and powers in their higheſt perfection were inadequate? What God calls us to perform, is but our reaſonable ſervice. And yet it muſt be owned, that duties are required of us, for which we have not, at preſent, a <hi>moral</hi> ability. It would be impious in the higheſt degree, for us to deny that it is our indiſpenſable duty, to love the Lord our God, with all our hearts, minds and ſtrength, and our neighbours as ourſelves; and it would be equally falſe and abſurd to ſay, that we have a moral power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this important obligation in our depraved ſtate. But as we were originally ſufficient for theſe things, and have no one to blame but ourſelves, that we did not <hi>continue</hi> ſo, we are without excuſe in not living in the conſtant habit and exerciſe of them. We muſt own, that all the duties required of our common parents, when recent from their Maker's hands, by the <hi>moral</hi> law, may be demanded, with equal juſtice, of their poſterity; but they are under no <hi>further</hi> obligations until they have a revelation from heaven. The obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which our parents owed the moral law <hi>prior</hi> to the fall, was without controverſy, due <hi>then</hi> from their poſterity, who ſeminally and repreſentatively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted in them; and the law being as unalterable as the divine perfections of which it is a tranſcript, the very ſame obedience muſt be as juſtly due <hi>ſinc</hi> the fall. The guilty loſs of our moral power to obey, by no means ſlackened our obligations to obedience. The divine law, founded in eternal equity, and the various relations ſuſtained by all intelligent creatures to God and each other, form the univerſal, perpetual, and unalterable criterion of vice and virtue. "By the law is the knowledge of ſin." If the law might have been ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the beſt obedience of which fallen men are capable, Chriſt need not have come to magnify and make it honorable. For it is evident that in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025616_0017_0FCE9CAD93592000"/>
which has the approbation of the law, a man may be juſtified before God. The ſcriptures and facts too, declare our guilt of the firſt man's offence. And the loſs of our original righteouſneſs abſtractedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, being our common ſin, or ſin of our nature, cannot be admitted as an <hi>excuſe,</hi> but is rather an <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of our want of conformity unto, and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the divine law. A man's voluntary intoxication, eſpecially when he is apprized and warned of its effects, furniſhes him with no admiſſible apology for any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential miſdemeanor. But as it did not become the duty of Adam to believe in the Meſſiah, until he was revealed unto him, and <hi>then</hi> only according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>in which</hi> he was revealed, ſo his ſons can be under no obligation to believe either in the written, or <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> word, without a revalation.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who are favored with a revelation, are bound to a correſpondent faith. Theſe are the perſons of whom faith in our report are required; and upon what <hi>grounds,</hi> comes next under our conſideration. In attending to this matter, it will be neceſſary to make an enquiry with reſpect to the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a revelation. It is ſaid by the deiſts, that a revelation is unneceſſary; reaſon, as poſſeſſed by man in his preſent ſtate, being adequate to all his exigencies: And could this aſſertion be <hi>proved,</hi> all would be conſtrained to allow that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aſſiſtance would be ſuperfluous, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would not be afforded. But what our natural light is competent to, let the ſtate of the <hi>preſent</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then nations, and the public and well-known practices of the <hi>paſt,</hi> at the moſt enlightened periods, declare. It is notorious that there are nations of men, whoſe collected wiſdom and ingenuity are inſufficient, as an elegant writer obſerves, to form a nail or a hatchet. Their worſhip is worſe than <hi>brutal;</hi> they are in every reſpect <hi>hateful, hating,</hi> and <hi>(literally) biting, devouring</hi> and maſſacreing one another. And whether the unaſſiſted reaſon of ſuch wretched ſavages, ever ſo ſtrictly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, may be depended upon as a ſure guide to virtue
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025616_0018_0FCE9CAEA4D31408"/>
and happineſs; and what they might do towards form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſyſtem of laws and ethics, tending to promote and ſecure their preſent and future felicity, I leave my judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearers to determine. The deplorable condition of theſe profoundly ignorant and moſt unhappy beings, who are partakers of all our merely natural advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and the fragments of revelation found among the more improved heathen nations, tend to prove that even all the improvements in ſcience, arts and civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the latter, are greatly owing to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural revelation. And it may be rationally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that if it were not for the very advantages derived from the ſcriptures, thoſe who are now laurel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as men of wit and politeneſs, merely becauſe they can dextrouſly ridicule every thing that is ſacred, might have been like the Hottentots, adorned with the entrails of wild beaſts tied to their hair, as enſigns of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior worth and accompliſhments. But without ſome knowledge of the bible, by tradition or otherwiſe, it has been found by long obſervation, that no nation or community could ever arrive at any tolerable degree of moral or religious refinement. The public practices of the learned and renowned heathens of antiquity, which were highly eſteemed and celebrated by their famous poets and orators, were groſsly idolatrous, and moſt deteſtably obſcene, lewd and cruel. No abſtract rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings can affect the validity of theſe ſtubborn and melancholy facts, or hinder them from ſhewing, to all who will calmly conſider, the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a revelation from heaven. And none can deny that the thing, in itſelf, is poſſible. God is undeniably able to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate divine intelligence to his rational creatures, which his goodneſs induces a hope for: And who, in our happy land of light, is not convinced that this is <hi>done?</hi> The glorious effects of ſupernatural rays, every where evince their divine origin. <hi>True light</hi> in the moral world, now ſhines. And all muſt be conſtrained to own, that the bible, from its pureneſs and excellency, has, indiſputably, the faireſt pretenſions to this exalted
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025616_0019_0FCE9CB0059AA588"/>
character: In this reſpect it has no competitor. The <hi>once</hi> famous lying oracles among the pagans, have been long ſince dumb. And no man of candor and information, will put the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in competition with the writings which we call inſpired. For though it is highly vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Mahometans, as brought chapter by chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to their founder, by the angel Gabriel; it is an evident medley of paganiſm, Judaiſm and chriſtianity, without a ſingle internal mark of originality; much leſs of inſpiration. In a time of groſs darkneſs, it was palmed upon its deluded votaries, in order to unite them together in bloody wars with their neighbors. And the helliſh project ſucceeded. The execrable end was anſwered to the gratification of the pride, ambition and ſenſuality of its author. But Mahomet himſelf, never denied the divine authority of the bible. His pretence was, to revive the primitive way of worſhip and purity practiſed by the ancient patriarchs: The Jews readily acknowledge the authenticity of the old teſtament, which every unprejudiced and diſcerning perſon muſt ſee ſtands or falls with the new. And theſe excellent writings, not only ſhine with unrivaled ſplendor, when compared with others, but appear to ſtill higher advantage, both as to evidence and worth, upon an <hi>abſolute</hi> inveſtigation. Both their matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner beſpeak their author. They contain every thing that could be required or expected from a divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and nothing more. They are neither deficient nor redundant. "Indeed," ſays the great Mr. Locke, "the perfection, the fulneſs, the comprehenſion of the holy ſcriptures, is truly aſtoniſhing." Nor is it matter of wonder, that men of ſuch penetration and profound erudition, as Selden, Milton, Boyle, Locke, Sir Iſaac Newton, Addiſon and Lyttleton, ranked among their warmeſt admirers. They are adapted to every ſtate and capacity; and with a commanding authority, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming efficacy on the heart, inculcate every thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective of mankind, both in time and eternity. They poſſeſs the beauties and excellency of hiſtorical, poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025616_0020_0FCE9CB195EE9408"/>
epiſtolary, theological and moral compoſition, in their higheſt perfection. The ſimplicity, ſolemnity, conciſeneſs, ſublimity and majeſty of their ſtyle, excite the admiration of all who have critical knowledge, or a taſte for fine writings; to which may be added, the aptneſs and elegance of their ſimilies, parables, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors allegories, and other elucidating, engaging and ſtriking figures of ſpeech, which are equalled by nothing but the excellency of their doctrines, the purity of their morals, and the importance of the facts they relate or unfold. And this invaluable aſſemblage of ſacred truths, is pervaded by the ſweeteſt harmony, and the ſtricteſt conſiſtence. This internal evidence of its divine original is found, upon ſtrict examination, to be irreſiſtibly ſtrong; but it authenticity is alſo clearly atteſted, by a cloud of unexceptionable witneſſes from without. We find the bleſſed bible in the higheſt eſtimation with all good men, in every age, among whom are many not only of the fineſt parts and greateſt diſcernment, but ſuch who diſplay its efficacy by a virtuous and exemplary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; a number of whom have, at various periods, but particularly in the early days of chriſtianity, ſeated the truth of their teſtimony with their blood. And it is no where treated with contempt but by wicked men whoſe diſlike ariſes from the reproof it gives their vices which is a moſt convincing evidence of its intrinſic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. The enemies of the chriſtian religion among Jews and gentiles, demonſtrate its genuineneſs, and are every day fulfilling the predictions of its adorable author. And notwithſtanding the oppoſition it meets with from the luſts and paſſions of men, by a ſpecial providence it is permanently eſtabliſhed in various populous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and great nations, and extorts external deference from many who ſecretly repine at its proſperity; the clouds of ignorance, error and ſuperſtition fly <hi>before,</hi> and the works of darkneſs languiſh <hi>under</hi> its effulgent beams. Its friends and advocates are continually ſtrengthening and multiplying, and its infatuated ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies falling before its <hi>gentle,</hi> though irreſiſtable influence.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:025616_0021_0FCE9CB30C7817C8"/>If we look back to the primitive ſtate of chriſtianity, we find it ſurrounded by <hi>numerous</hi> learned politic and powerful perſecutors among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet gloriouſly triumphing over all oppoſition. It made its way without the leaſt external force, with ſuch amazing rapidity through the kingdoms of the world, that this ſingle circumſtance is enough to convince any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man, it was aſſiſted by divine power. "Turtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian tells the Roman governors, that their corporations, councils, armies, tribes, companies, the palace, ſenate and courts of judicature, were filled with chriſtians. And Arnobious aſſerts, that men of the fineſt parts and learning, orators, grammarians, rhetoricians, lawyers, phyſicians, philoſophers, deſpiſing the ſentiments they had been once fond of, took up their reſt in the chriſtian religlon." Neither ſecret fraud, nor open violence, could retard its progreſs. As to the <hi>miracles</hi> aſcribed by the ſcriptures to Chriſt and his apoſtles, their moſt avowed enemies acknowledged them, though they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly and blaſphemouſly aſcribed them to magic. Than theſe, nothing at the ſame diſtance of time, can be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter atteſted, And none can deny, that the writers of the ſcriptures appear to have been good men. Their whole lives and their deaths demonſtrated the purity of their intentions. And as they lived in different nations, and in diſtant ages, it is impoſſible there could have been any combination among them to deceive. Beſides, good men would ſcorn to deceive, or attempt affixing the ſeal of heaven to their own performances. From the manner in which they received their various intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, it is impoſſible they could have been deceived themſelves. And it is certain, from the implacable enmity that wicked men have ever manifeſted againſt the ſcriptures, that perſons of their ſpirit and character never wrote them. Upon theſe conſiderations, together with the acknowledged accompliſhment of many of their important predictions, we fairly conclude that their author is God. If with this authority and evidence, to mention no more, the ſcriptures are not believed,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025616_0022_0FCE9CB48559B488"/>
by thoſe to whom they are ſent, the infidels, virtually, in the judgment of an apoſtle, give God the lie, and may therefore juſtly expect, except they repent, the foreſt condemnation. Yet this ſin is as common, as aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; though it is impoſſible for a hiſtory to be better atteſted than that of the bible; or more calculated to promote the happineſs of mankind, even in this life. Collectively conſidered, believers are exceedingly nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, but they are comparatively few. In this point of view, we may exclaim "Who hath believed our report?" But diſmiſſing the explication,</p>
            <p>I ſhall laſtly endeavour to anſwer a few of the moſt plauſible and popular objections againſt what has been delivered. I have ſhewn that there are three that bear record in heaven, and that theſe three are one; that God's underſtanding is infinite; that he works all things according to the counſel of his own will; that there is an election of grace to eternal glory; that the elect are predeſtinated to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt; that others, for their foreſeen ſins, are righteouſly appointed unto wrath; that all gifts and graces beſtowed upon the church from age to age, under every diſpenſation, Chriſt ſtipulated for in the covenant of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; that he obeyed, ſuffered and died for the elect only, to whom accordingly the ſpecial benefits of his death are peculiar; that thoſe only who <hi>hear</hi> are bound to believe; that a revelation never requires a faith differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from its own nature; that ſupernatural light is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, might be expected, and evidently is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; that the bible contains it; and, upon the internal and external evidence in its favor, is to be received as the record of a divine revelation. And againſt a ſyſtem of doctrines ſo conſiſtent with itſelf, and all the known attributes of God; ſo corroborated by all the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of providence; ſo much for the intereſts, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſecurity of all good men; and ſo much for the encouragement of all who ſincerely deſire to be ſaved from ſin and miſery, one would think there could be few ſerious objections. And we are fully perſuaded
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025616_0023_0FCE9CB637C0BC50"/>
there are none ſo weighty but may be removed. What has been advanced is indeed myſteriouſly awful and ſtupendous, infinitely tranſcending all the powers of human reaſon. And if it was otherwiſe, as it profeſſes to be a revelation of the counſels of eternal wiſdom, the origin, revolutions and final ſtates of the rational world, it would be leſs credible. Theſe are the deep things of God which the ſpirit reveals, and which angels deſire to look into. Had we an exact account of the material ſyſtem of the univerſe, in its <hi>nature,</hi> connection and dependencies, perhaps we ſhould not be leſs aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. Yet the myſterious nature of ſome divine truths, is conſidered, by a certain claſs of men, as a very capital objection againſt them. They think it unreaſonable to <hi>believe</hi> without <hi>comprehending</hi> a propoſition. I allude to thoſe incredulous gentlemen (and ſuch as partake mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably of their ſpirit) who can <hi>only believe</hi> that the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and aſtoniſhingly grand ſyſtem, of which the terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous globe is a ſmall part, is the illuſtrious offspring of the great goddeſs CHANCE; to whom they aſcribe their own fearful and wonderful formation, together with the preſervation and government of all worlds. And this is no greater an exertion of the credulous faculty, than to believe that a commodious and ſuperb edifice, diſplaying all the ſymmetry, proportion and elegance of architecture, may be an accidental coalition of heterogeneous materials. Every article in their creed is as evident, as that a moſt curious and uſeful watch, may be the reſult of a fortuitous collection of ſplendid particles, independent of ingenuity or deſign: Or, that a voluminous and accurate hiſtory, containing an authentic narrative of the events of an age, and embelliſhed with all the elegancies of diction, may be the production of types and points, formed, and thrown together by accident. But we are told, that our ſcheme is not only too myſterious for admiſſion, but makes God the author of ſin. This we deny. Though we cannot to account for its origin, believe with the Manichoeans, that there are two almighty conflicting principles, who
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025616_0024_0FCE9CB8AF058190"/>
reign independent of each other, one of whom is the author of evil; yet we acknowledge it is dreadfully certain, ſin has entered into our ſyſtem and reigned unto death; but its origin, among the ſecret things which belong to God, is in many reſpects, environed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable darkneſs. From his purity and holineſs we know that he can tempt no man <hi>to,</hi> nor have the leaſt fellowſhip <hi>with</hi> ſin, much leſs be the author of it; but as he is the Almighty, and does whatſoever his ſoul pleaſeth, it is equally certain that it cannot exiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his permiſſive will. It is evident that God could have prevented its exiſtence, and we are ſure his goodneſs and benevolence would have diſpoſed him to it, would it have ultimately anſwered the moſt valuable and important purpoſe. He had, no doubt, infinitely weighty reaſons, to us unknown, for forming as he did all his permiſſive and effective decrees, which he fulfils in a wiſe, holy, juſt, and powerful manner; without offering the leaſt degree of violence to the will of a creature. He has permitted poiſons to enter into the <hi>natural</hi> as well as the <hi>moral</hi> world, and has created their antidotes; and in ſo doing, was not leſs holy than wonderful in counſel; and is as pure as excellent in operation. Here the grey-headed objection, "why doth he yet find fault; for who hath reſiſted his will?" is ſure to be revived; but our apoſtle has anſwered it. Wicked men and devils muſt know, that their voluntary wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be righteouſly puniſhed, though God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules it, contrary to their deſign and intention, for his own glory. The wrath of man ſhall praiſe him, and the remainder he will reſtrain. The wicked are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, though with ſatanical effrontery they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> againſt God. Another objection againſt our repoſe is, that it charges God with being a reſpecter of perſons. But let it be conſidered, that a ſovereign judge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the capacity of a benefactor, may give to one man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being under the leaſt obligation to beſtow as much upon every one in the ſame condition; though in the execution of his office, he muſt pronounce ſentence upon
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025616_0025_0FCE9CB9CCF6D130"/>
every offender, in exact proportion to his guilt. To depart from the line of juſtice in the laſt inſtance, will ſubject him to a charge of partiality; to which he is never liable, in doing what he will with his own. And who can preſume to deny the judge of all the earth the ſame privilege. In diſpenſing of his benefits, he may and does open wide his munificent hands, and give liberally to ſome, while he with-holds from others; which applies to the common bounties of providence, as well as to the ſpecial bleſſings of grace. But as a law-giver and judge, "God will render to every man according to his deeds: To them, who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honor, and immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs; indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile. For there is no reſpect of perſons with God." When he gives, it is not from a partiality to the objects of his bounty; but from motives of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign goodneſs within himſelf. He has as much reſpect for a Gentile, as for a Jew; for the poor, as for the rich; for the bond, as for the free; for the illiterate, as for the learned. Our doctrines only contend, with the ſcriptures, for his doing what he will with his own. It is alſo ſaid, that the doctrine of particular election, repreſents God as unrighteous and cruel, in paſſing by a number of fallen men, without giving them a chance for ſalvation. Pleaſe to obſerve, that thoſe who deny an election of perſons to glory, are conſtrained directly or indirectly to argue, that God was bound by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to put the whole loſt race of men into a ſalvable ſtate; for were they to acknowledge, that he might have juſtly left <hi>all men</hi> to periſh, as trangreſſors of his holy law, it would undeniably follow, that he might, as he certainly did, leave <hi>ſome men</hi> to periſh. But if God was bound to make ſalvation poſſible for all men, proviſion for their recovery was no act of mercy, but the diſcharge of an indiſpenſible obligation. If God
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025616_0026_0FCE9CBD2FCE4800"/>
could not juſtly have left ſinners to periſh in, and for their ſins, he was bound in, and by juſtice to provide for their ſalvation. But does this accord with the <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi> Do <hi>they</hi> ſay that in laying the foundation of our hope, God did by us what <hi>juſtice required;</hi> or that he had <hi>unmerited mercy</hi> upon us? If making ſalvation poſſible was required by <hi>juſtice,</hi> all that we have to praiſe God for, on this head, is for not acting contrary, at leaſt, to one of his attributes; which was impoſſible. But this, with a <hi>witneſs,</hi> makes proviſion for ſalvation of debt, inſtead of grace. Again, the advocates for this ſcheme, which makes ſalvation poſſible to <hi>all men,</hi> grant, it does not make it abſolutely ſure to <hi>any</hi> man. Now if this ſcheme is true, it was not impoſſible but Chriſt might have died in vain; but for him to die in vain, according to the counſel of God, is an event unworthy of an all-wiſe, immutable and almighty being; therefore this celebrated ſcheme, ſo congruous to the ideas of natural men, muſt be falſe. I ſpeak to thoſe who acknowledge the divinity of Chriſt, and unto wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay. Beſides, does this plan exclude <hi>boaſting,</hi> even before God? Was a man to be glorified upon it, might he not riſe with propriety before the eternal throne, and addreſſing himſelf to the happy intelligences, ſay, "I confeſs I fell in Adam, but God being <hi>bound</hi> to put me into a ſalvable ſtate, I was capacitated, in common with my ſpecies, to <hi>ſave my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and, fulfilling the conditions of my ſalvation, by a ſteady perſeverance, without the leaſt ſpecial aſſiſtance, I happily arrived at glory. And thoſe indolent and perverſe wretches, who are ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire, had in every reſpect, an equal chance with me for a bliſsful immortality. It was not the impartial Jehovah who made me to differ; by <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> I am what I am!" Theſe, and many other ſimilar abſurdities, we muſt admit, or elſe acknowledge with St. Paul, that God might have mercy on whom he would, without the ſhadow of cruelty or injuſtice. Some who hold that Chriſt died <hi>intentionally</hi> for the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025616_0027_0FCE9CBE61FA8838"/>
               <hi>elect only,</hi> think our ſyſtem deficient, becauſe it does not allow that he died <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for <hi>all mankind.</hi> But, with all deference, I beg leave to ſay, that this appears, at leaſt to me, to be a groundleſs diſtinction. It is certain Chriſt's merits were <hi>ſufficient,</hi> had they been deſigned for ſuch an end, to have ſatisfied for as many ſinful worlds, upon the ſuppoſition of their exiſtence and fall, as there are individuals belonging to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. But the <hi>object</hi> cannot be inferred from the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of Chriſt's death. He will ſave <hi>no more,</hi> and he will certainly ſave <hi>no leſs,</hi> than thoſe for whom, by divine appointment, he <hi>died,</hi> and for whom he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>intercedes.</hi> All men receive innumerable common gifts and bleſſings, for the elect's ſake, in conſequence of Chriſt's mediatorial interpoſition; but as he never intended to ſave thoſe whom he knew would be <hi>eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> loſt, it appears inconſiſtent with the divine wiſdom and oeconomy, to make proviſion in his redemption for them. Chriſt is the common and providential ſaviour of all men; but he is the ſpecial ſaviour only of thoſe whom he <hi>purchaſed;</hi> and to whom he accordingly <hi>gives</hi> evangelical faith and eternal life. Some think a great difficulty ariſes here from the obligations all men are under to believe in Chriſt. But let them diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween believing in Chriſt as the Meſſiah, with an hiſtoric or rational faith which is required, and may be produced by the written word; and believing in him ſpiritually, as having died for our ſins, which faith is of divine operation, and the difficulty vaniſhes. Their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt as the Meſſiah, was the unbelief for which the Jews were blamed, and for which their puniſhment will be more intolerable in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than that of Sodom and Gomorrah, who added not the contempt of the goſpel, to the violation of the law. A man will not be blamed, much leſs damned in the great day, becauſe he did not believe that Chriſt died for his ſins. No conſiſtent Calviniſt will grant that any man will be damned, for whoſe ſins of every kind, Chriſt died; and I ſuppoſe there is no one that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025616_0028_0FCE9CBFC51AE280"/>
can think a man may be damned for not believing what is not true. But one of theſe propoſitions is true, or no ſinner will be damned for not believing that Chriſt died for him.</p>
            <p>The Jews, with all other men, were in a condemned ſtate when Chriſt came; and they hated and rejected that glorious light, becauſe their deeds were previouſly evil. They were told that they were in a ſtate of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as the ſinful offspring of Adam, as was evident from their not having faith, the only inſtrument and evidence of perſonal juſtification. Some, from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ſcriptures to be full of offers of ſalvation to all men, infer an univerſal redemption. And without ſuppoſing, either that God is <hi>inſincere</hi> and <hi>diſingenuous</hi> in his <hi>offers,</hi> or that Chriſt purchaſed ſalvation for many in vain, they muſt hold, to be <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſalvation too. But it ſhould be carefully obſerved, that eternal life is not the <hi>offer,</hi> but the <hi>gift</hi> of God. And all invitations to a participation of ſpecial benefits are addreſſed to the characters to whom the promiſes belong. If Chriſt, as man, had no right to beſtow a place in his kingdom on a petitioner, but according to his Father's appointment, much leſs have his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a right to offer ſalvation to thoſe for whom the Father never may have deſigned it. There is a diviſion of the word to be made, and the different characters are to have their different portions. Chriſt crucified, or the goſpel, which knows nothing of offers, terms or penalties, but is a declaration of life and ſalvation through Chriſt, for condemned, ruined, helpleſs ſinners, is to be preached to every intelligent attending creature. And all that find, and feel themſelves condemned, ruined and helpleſs, are to be encouraged to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for ſuch he came to ſeek and to ſave. He was anointed to preach good tidings to the meek, and came to bind up the broken hearted; and, not to <hi>offer,</hi> but to <hi>proclaim</hi> liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound; to comfort all that mourn. The ſimple, the ſcorners and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025616_0029_0FCE9CC146ED3D38"/>
ſinners of every deſcription, are to be exhorted to attend to the reproofs of wiſdom, and uſe all the public and private means of grace; and repentance is to be preached, and enforced as the duty of all men; for had not a ſaviour been provided for any man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance would have been the duty of all ſinners; but theſe are not to be invited to partake of the food and privileges of children. IF children, <hi>then</hi> heirs. It is ſaid that ſinners muſt have Chriſt, or life through him offered to them, to leave them without excuſe, which involves the abſurdity of God's being <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>provide</hi> and <hi>offer</hi> a ſaviour to fallen men, to leave them <hi>inexcuſeable;</hi> as if the law did not ſtop every man's mouth, and prove the whole world guilty before God. But Chriſt came not to condemn the world. It is not Chriſt, but Moſes that accuſes men to the Father. It is not the <hi>goſpel</hi> that condemns and leaves men without excuſe, but the <hi>law.</hi> Some, who would be thought great friends to holineſs, are apprehenſive we neglect the intereſt of morality, and open a door for licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by not making works the condition of ſalvation; but we moſt freely leave the world to determine what doctrines have been moſt owned through all ages, in deſtroying the works of darkneſs, and producing the fruits of holineſs. If we conſider the dead in ſin, in no capacity to work for life; we believe thoſe who are the workmanſhip of God, created anew in Chriſt Jeſus, will work <hi>from</hi> life. And natural men, who diſcern not the things of the ſpirit, but deem them fooliſhneſs, have many other motives which are more powerful with them, to diſcharge the external duties of which they are capable, than the promiſe of eternal life would be. As to the frivolous, vulgar objections againſt the doctrines of grace, from their being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly ſuppoſed to render the uſe of means, holineſs, and a judgment to come, unneceſſary, becauſe theſe things cannot change the mind of God, or give him information, they are too palpably contemptible to be regarded. As the light of truth and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025616_0030_0FCE9CC448701090"/>
prevail, our glorious ſyſtem will ſhine and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with peculiar luſtre and energy. The more it is ſtudied and inveſtigated, the more perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly its excellencies appear. It exalts every attribute of deity, ſhews the neceſſary dependance of all things on the firſt cauſe, gives weight, efficacy and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency to all the divine promiſes, threatenings, and prophecies, leaves ſinners without excuſe, excludes boaſting from ſaints, and lays a <hi>firm</hi> foundation for the <hi>full</hi> aſſurance of faith, for the moſt <hi>lively</hi> hope, <hi>humble</hi> reſignation, <hi>perfect</hi> patience, <hi>manly</hi> fortitude, and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted</hi> piety. Heathens could exclaim againſt vice, as the odious bane of perſonal and ſocial felicity, with as much pertinence and zeal, as our <hi>merely</hi> moral preachers, and ſhew with equal elegance, the nature, beauty, fitneſs and utility of moral duties: But evangelical preachers not only ſet morality in a more engaging light, but direct to ſtrength and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſcover a rational method of acceptance for our perſons and performances with an offended God; and engage us in the higheſt improvement of our nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the moſt vigorous exertion of all our powers, for the intereſts of mankind, and the glory of God, by the moſt <hi>animating</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> motives drawn from the grand peculiarities of the goſpel.
