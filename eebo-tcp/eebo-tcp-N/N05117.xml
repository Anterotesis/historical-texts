            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>civil Government</hi> is ſo obvious to any One, that conſiders the State &amp; Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the World, that we may conclude, None will deſpiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, but ſuch unhappy Perſons, whoſe <hi>Minds &amp; Conſciences are defiled,</hi> and themſelves unto every <hi>good Work reprobate; walking after their own Luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR, as in the Days when <hi>there was no King in Iſrael, and every Man did that which was right in his own Eyes,</hi> (Judg. 21.25.) Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment departed from them, and all evil Works &amp; Confuſions prevail'd amongſt; them; So will it be amongſt every People where there is no Government. <hi>Judgment will turn away back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and Juſtice ſtand afar off</hi> from ſuch a People: <hi>Truth will fail, and he that departeth from Evil,</hi> will <hi>make himſelf a Prey.</hi> The <hi>Feet</hi> of Multitudes will <hi>run to Evil,</hi> and <hi>they make

haste to ſhed innocent Blood. Waſting and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> will indeed be in <hi>their Paths</hi>; and all manner of Oppreſſions prevail among them. The Propheſie concerning <hi>Iſhmael</hi> would ſoon be the juſt Character of Multitudes, that He ſhould <hi>be a wild Man, his Hand againſt every Man, &amp; every Man's Hand againſt him,</hi> (Gen. 16.12.)</p>
            <p>BUT yet, there have aroſe, even amongſt them that pretend to <hi>approve Things that are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> and <hi>to believe on the Name of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, ſome that <hi>deſpiſe Dominion, &amp; ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> (Jude 7.) Under a <hi>Pretence</hi> of Liberty, <hi>falſly ſo called,</hi> they would <hi>put down all Rule, &amp; all Authority, &amp; Power</hi> among Men: Pleading in Defence of their licentious Doctrine, that CHRIST <hi>hath made all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Kings; and they ſhall reign on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS they pretend is the <hi>Liberty where with Christ have made them free.</hi> They pretend to believe, that the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of the Church of Chriſt depends upon the Deſtruction of all <hi>temporal</hi> Powers; and that the <hi>golden Age</hi> of the Church, and the expected <hi>Millennium</hi> is to be introduced by weakning the Power of the Princes of this World, and ſetting Men upon a <hi>Level.</hi> And therefore have ſometimes been called by the Name of <hi>Levellers.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006430_0006_1028E8B54E253358"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> hath written concerning thrift <hi>chriſtian Liberty,</hi> that he was a Friend to <hi>Anarchy,</hi> — and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenanced ſuch <hi>Levelling Principles,</hi> He treats particularly upon civil Government in this Chapter: Shewing the <hi>divine Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>Appointment,</hi> the <hi>Uſe &amp; Deſign</hi> of it; and the great <hi>Work</hi> &amp; <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of thoſe that are intruſded with the Adminiſtration thereof: Declaring alſo, that GOD himſelf requires Obedience and Subjection to the Same.</p>
            <p>HE injoins <hi>that every Soul be ſubjeft unto the higher Powers,</hi> [or the Authority placed over them] <hi>For there is no Power,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>but of</hi> GOD, [the Fountain of it:] <hi>The Powers that be are ordained of</hi> GOD, v.1.</p>
            <p>HE is ſo far from countenancing Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Authority, that he declares, as v.2. <hi>Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of</hi> GOD: <hi>and they that reſist, ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</hi> To reſiſt the Government, in the Adminiſtration of that Power GOD hath committed to them, is as it were to wage War againſt GOD himſelf, and to renounce <hi>His</hi> Government, by whom <hi>Princes rule, &amp; Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth,</hi> (Prov. 8.16.) And therefore the Children of Rebellion have Reaſon to expect that GOD himſelf will ariſe to plead his Cauſe, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Authority; that He will <hi>ſpeak to them in his Wrath, &amp; vex them in his ſore Diſpleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:006430_0007_1028E8BB1A4572D8"/>THE Apoſtle alſo preſſeth Subjection to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the <hi>Original Intention</hi> &amp; <hi>Design</hi> of Government, which is the <hi>publick Good. For Rulers,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>are not a Terrour to good Works, but to the evil</hi>; in the former Part of v.3. Rulers acting by the Authority of GOD, (and <hi>there is no Power but of</hi> GOD) are not a Diſcouragement to <hi>good works, but to the evil</hi>: They are not deſign'd to diſcourage any Thing, that tends to promote the Welfare of the World, but only to be a Terrour to ſuch Works, as bring a Curſe upon the World, and hurt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Men. They are armed with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity &amp; Power, to prepare <hi>Judgments for Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Stripes for the Back of Fools</hi>; to <hi>ſcatter the Wicked, and bring the Wheel over them,</hi> (Prov 19.29. &amp; 20.26.) Let Men but lead <hi>a peaceable &amp; quiet Life in all Godlineſs &amp; Honeſty,</hi> and the Magiſtrate, as GOD's Vicegerent, will do them no Hurt; but will rather protect and incourage them.</p>
            <p>AND therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, in the latter Part of v.3, &amp; Beginning of v.4. <hi>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have Praiſe of the ſame: For he is the Miniſter of</hi> GOD <hi>to thee for Good.</hi> Magiſtrates are deputed &amp; delegated to act for GOD: He gives them Power &amp; Authority to incourage the Vertuous; to <hi>maintain their Right and Cauſe.</hi>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006430_0008_1028E8BCD9A36A60"/>INDEED, if Men <hi>are contentious, and do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Truth, but obey Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> they have Reaſon to be afraid of the Magiſtrate's Power: And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, in the latter Part of v.4. <hi>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain: for he is the Miniſter of</hi> GOD, <hi>a revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth evil.</hi> They are as it were armed with GOD's <hi>Sword of Juſtice,</hi> and muſt weild it for Him. GOD hath made them his <hi>Officers</hi> not only to incourage the Vertuous, but to execute Puniſhments &amp; Wrath upon them that do evil.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, ſaith the Apoſtle, v.5 <hi>Ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience Sake.</hi> I.E. Not only for Fear of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from the Magiſtrate, but out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Duty; becauſe <hi>ſo is the Will of</hi> GOD,(1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15.)</p>
            <p>FOR, ſaith the Apoſtle in our <hi>Text, for this Cauſe pay you Tribute alſo: for they are GOD's Miniſters, attending continually upon this very Thing.</hi> Q. D. 'Tis in Token of that Subjection you owe them, and in <hi>Support</hi> of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, you pay <hi>Tribute</hi> to them, as being GOD's <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and imployed in the publick Service of their Country; <hi>attending continually</hi> upon this great Work, to which they are commiſſion'd, as Truſtees for the publick Good, <hi>Scil.</hi> to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect</hi> &amp; <hi>incourage</hi> the Righteous, to <hi>maintain</hi> the

            <p>Now the <hi>Text</hi> tells us, <hi>They are</hi> GOD's <hi>Miniſters.</hi> I am ſenſible indeed, there is a Diſtinction between the <hi>ſupreme Powers,</hi> and <hi>inferiour Magiſtrates,</hi> commiſſion'd by them, according to 1 Pet. 2.13, 14 <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake: Whether it be to the King, as ſupreme; or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him for the Puniſhment of evil Doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do Well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT althô there are various <hi>Degrees</hi> &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Men intruſted with the administration of Government, and the lower Orders <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> derive their Authority from thoſe above
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006430_0010_1028E8C321213380"/>
them, yet they all <hi>ultimately</hi> derive their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from GOD; are <hi>His</hi> Miniſters, and rule for <hi>Him.</hi> And therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice. By me Princes rule, ana Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As in Kingdoms &amp; particular Governments, all Power <hi>deſcends,</hi> from the ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon ſubordinate Magiſtrates &amp; Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; ſo in the univerſal Monarchy of the World, all lawful Power &amp; Authority is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from GOD, the <hi>ſupreme Lord</hi> of the World. And, thô the Derivation of this Authority be <hi>mediate,</hi> and Men are in <hi>various</hi> Ways intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereunto, according to the diverſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Kingdoms, States &amp; Governments; yet ſtill the <hi>Authority</hi> by which they rule is from GOD, the <hi>Head &amp; Fountain</hi> of all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Authority.</p>
            <p>'Tis the <hi>most High</hi> that rules in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Men by the Miniſtry of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>: And they miniſter as in <hi>His</hi> Name, and by Authority and Commiſſion from <hi>Him</hi>: And therefore they are ſtiled <hi>Gods,</hi> Pſal. 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid, Ye are Gods: and all of you are Children of the most High.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL Government belongs <hi>originally</hi> unto GOD himſelf; but he deputes ſome of the <hi>Sons</hi> of Men to act for <hi>Him</hi>; veſts them with <hi>His</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and charges them, as 2 Chron. 19.6. <hi>Take

Heed what ye do: for ye judge not for Man, but for the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>BUT we proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">II. IN <hi>the ſecond Place, The great Ends and Deſign of civil Government, and the great Work and Buſineſs of thoſe intruſted with the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND <hi>in general,</hi> we may ſay, that the <hi>publick Good</hi> is the great End, and <hi>original Deſign</hi> of the Inſtitution of civil Government. It was ordain'd as a <hi>Means</hi> to promote the <hi>Peace</hi> &amp; <hi>Welfare</hi> of the World; to guard &amp; defend the Innocent, ſhelter and relieve the Oppreſſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Vertuous, and diſcourage Vice &amp; Wickedneſs: And <hi>This</hi> is the great Thing civil Rulers are <hi>continually to attend upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>POWER is given to them from <hi>above,</hi> to the <hi>End</hi> they may <hi>incourage</hi> ſuch Things as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the <hi>Welfare</hi> of Mankind, &amp; may ſuppreſs ſuch Things as are <hi>injurious</hi> to the World. A <hi>Sword</hi> is put into their Hands for the <hi>Protection</hi> of them that <hi>do Well,</hi> and the <hi>Chaſtiſements</hi> of <hi>evil Doers.</hi> Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. ONE <hi>End &amp; Deſign</hi> of civil Government, and ſo <hi>Part of the Work &amp; Buſineſs</hi> of thoſe that are <hi>intruſted</hi> with the Adminiſtration thereof, is, <hi>to maintain the publick Peace.</hi> Peace &amp; Quietneſſ is abſolutely neceſſary to the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Being of any People. 'Tis a <hi>fundamental</hi> Thing in all Governments, without which none
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006430_0012_1028E8C9421E5008"/>
of the other Ends of Government can be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor it ſelf <hi>long</hi> ſupported. A <hi>Kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided against it ſelf cannot ſtand,</hi> (Mar. 3.24.)</p>
            <p>AND then, where Men can't live quietly, they can't live happily. <hi>Broils</hi> &amp; <hi>Contention</hi> will render any Society of People unhappy, and overſpread the whole Face thereof with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion &amp; Miſery. 'Tis better dwelling alone in a Wilderneſs, than in the Midſt of Contentions &amp; Quarrels, where <hi>Fire-Brands, Arrows &amp; Death</hi> are caſt about. David in ſuch a Caſe wiſh'd for <hi>Wings</hi> ſwift as a <hi>Dove</hi> to <hi>flie away far off</hi> to ſome Place of Safety &amp; Repoſe, <hi>Psal</hi> 55.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>BUT now, without Government there would be endleſs <hi>Broils</hi> &amp; <hi>Strifes, Wars</hi> &amp; <hi>Fightings.</hi> To prevent which, the GOD <hi>of Peace</hi> hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd Government in the World. And Rulers are Miniſters of GOD to <hi>reſtrain the Wrath</hi> of Men, to curb in that Spirit of Diſcord, ſo ready to prevail on <hi>all</hi> Occaſions.</p>
            <p>IT can't be expected but that there will be ſome <hi>turbulent</hi> &amp; <hi>contentious</hi> Men among every People; unruly &amp; fierce, inclin'd to improve every Opportunity to ſet People together by the Ears, and ſcatter the Seeds of Diſcord, and violate the Laws of Peace: Now Government is deſign'd to reſtrain <hi>ſuch,</hi> that People may <hi>lead quiet &amp; peaceable Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly; ANOTHER <hi>End</hi> of civil Government, and ſo <hi>Part of the Buſineſs</hi> of civil Rulers, is, <hi>to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006430_0013_1028E8CB2C0A2798"/>
protect Men in the Enjoyment or their just Rights and Privileges, both natural &amp; acquired, civil &amp; religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL not exerciſe your Patience, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the various <hi>natural</hi> &amp; <hi>acquired, civil</hi> &amp; <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Rights &amp; Privileges</hi> of Men; which they juſtly value &amp; eſteem, and could not ſecurely poſſels without the Protection of Government: It is ſufficient to ſay, before an Auditory <hi>ſo well</hi> acquainted with the Rights &amp; Privileges of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that the great GOD, who <hi>loveth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſfs,</hi> hath inſtituted Government for the ſecuring of Men in the Enjoyment of theſe their Rights and Privileges.</p>
            <p>IF there were none in Authority, but every Man was left to do what was right in his own Eyes, there would be <hi>no</hi> ſecure poſſeſſing of any Thing. Juſtice and Righteouſneſs would ſoon forſake the Earth; Rapine &amp; Violence, Falſhood &amp; Oppreſſion would every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail &amp; triumph, and thoſe <hi>that turn Judgment to Wormwnood; and leave off Righteouſneſs in the Earth</hi> be multiplied. Neither Promiſes nor Bonds would avail Strength of Arm would be the only <hi>Law of Juſtice</hi> obtaining and acknowleged among Men.</p>
            <p>FOR the maintaining of Righteouſneſs and Judgment therefore in the Earth, is Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſet up. And therefore GOD charges his Miniſters intruſted with the Adminiſtration
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006430_0014_1028E8D3E046C970"/>
thereof, to <hi>execute Judgment &amp; Righteouſneſs, and deliver the ſpoiled out of the hand of the Oppreſſor,</hi> and to <hi>let Judgment run down as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream,</hi> (Jer. 22.3. Amos 5.24)</p>
            <p>BUT beſides our temporal Rights, we have our <hi>Spiritual</hi> Ones, as <hi>we are Members of the Body of Christ</hi>; even the invaluable <hi>Privileges of the Goſpel</hi>: Which, if they ſhould be taken from us, <hi>what have</hi> we more!</p>
            <p>AND yet, there may be Men diſpos'd to take theſe from us; who, if unreſtrain'd would <hi>ſpread forth their Hands upon all our pleaſant Things</hi>; drive us from the Houſe of the LORD, or diſturb us in our Worſhip there; <hi>break down the carved Work</hi> of the Houſe of GOD, or <hi>cast Fire into his Sanctuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is therefore alſo deſign'd to protect Men in the Poſſeſſion of their ſpiritual Privileges. And therefore 'tis ſaid concerning Zion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.23. <hi>Kings ſhall be thy nurſing Fathers, and their Queens thy nurſing Mothers.</hi> They are to be Guardians of the Religion, as well as the civil Rights &amp; Liberties of their People.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly; ANOTHER great <hi>Deſign</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo what Men <hi>intruſted</hi> with the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration thereof are continually to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, to <hi>incourage Men in well Doing.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith in v.3, of our Context, <hi>Do that which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006430_0015_1028E8D573B4C548"/>
is good, and thou ſhalt have Praiſe of the ſame,</hi> i.e. Of the Powers and Rulers.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is appointed to incourage &amp; promote univerſal Righteouſneſs &amp; Goodneſs; that Men might live not only peaceably and honeſtly, but <hi>religiouſly</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>THERE hath indeed been a great Cry of <hi>late</hi> Years, that the civil Magiſtrate hath Nothing to do about religious Matters, nor ought to make any Laws for the Incouragement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Protection of the Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But this is <hi>new</hi> Doctrine to the Church of Chriſt: Which hath always expected that <hi>chriſtian</hi> Kings ſhould be it's <hi>nurſing Fathers,</hi> and <hi>chriſtian</hi> Queens it's <hi>nurſing Mothers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED, whilſt the civil Powers remain'd <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the Croſs of</hi> CHRIST, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged <hi>Him</hi> their Head &amp; King, the Churches expected no great Help from them. They truſted on the Arm of Chriſt, whom GOD <hi>had ſet his King upon his holy Hill of Zion,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to work Salvation for them. And Chriſt himſelf by his <hi>immediate</hi> &amp; <hi>unſeen</hi> Hand was their Defence. And there is no Doubt, but Chriſt is yet able to plead his <hi>own</hi> Cauſe, and to maintain his little Flock in the World, if the higher Powers of this World ſhould neglect the Cauſe of Zion and Religion, and take no Care to ſupport the Worſhip of GOD, and the Cauſe of Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:006430_0016_1028E8D7AE0FC750"/>BUT yet, as it pleaſes GOD <hi>ordinarily</hi> to govern tne World more <hi>mediately</hi>; and when he deſign Good to the Church, to raiſe up &amp; ſpirit the higher Powers to protect &amp; help it; the People of Chriſt juſtly have their Eyes to theſe <hi>Vice-gerents</hi> of GOD for Protection and Help.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the new Teſtament-Church was a Day of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and GOD more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately maintan'd his Church and Cauſe in the World. But ſince Chriſtianity hath been <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> amongſt Men, and Kings have ſeen the <hi>Glory</hi> of the LORD upon his Church, and <hi>come to the Brightneſs of her Riſing,</hi> ſhe hath <hi>ſucked the Breaſts of Kings,</hi> according to the Prophecy concerning her, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.16.</p>
            <p>IT was therefore an ancient Promiſe to the Church, that when <hi>the Gentiles Should come to her Light, Their Kings ſhould miniſter unto her, Iſa.</hi> 69.10.</p>
            <p>AND indeed, as the Kingdom is CHRIST's, and <hi>He</hi> is made <hi>univerſal Lord</hi> under his Father, and <hi>all Power is given Him in Heaven &amp; Earth,</hi> (Mat, 28.18) and He is given <hi>to be Head over all Things to the Church,</hi> (Eph. 1.22.) what are the Powers of this World but the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>His</hi> Kingdom? — And if ſo, their <hi>Character</hi> Obliges them, to exert their Power for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, Preſervation and Glory of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:006430_0017_1028E8D9881A8238"/>OR, if we only conſider them as the <hi>Miniſsters of</hi> GOD <hi>for Good</hi> to the World, it is impoſſible that they ſhould anſwer to <hi>this</hi> Character, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endeavouring to ſupport &amp; incourage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For there is Nothing the <hi>Welfare</hi> of Mankind is ſo much intereſted in, as Religion: Nothing that will ſo beautifie and bleſs the World; that will ſo promote <hi>Peace</hi> &amp; <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> good Order and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>RELIGION <hi>is profitable unto all Things, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Promſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. 'Tis profitable to obtain the <hi>Bleſſing of GOD,</hi> and to promote thoſe <hi>ſocial Vertues</hi> that are the Glory &amp; Strength of a Society <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <q>Suppoſing, <hi>ſaith Biſhop Butler, in his Analogy of Religion,</hi> a Kingdom or Society of Men upon the Earth perfectly vertuous for many Ages.... All would in ſome Way contribute, to the publick Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity: and in it, each would enjoy the Fruits of his own Vertue.. Such a Kingdom would plainly be Superiour to all Others, and the World muſt gradually come under its Empire: not by Means of lawleſs Violence; but partly by what muſt he allowed to be juſt Conqueſt; and partly by other Kingdoms Submitting themſelves voluntarily to it,... and claiming its Piotection The Head of it would be an univerſal Monarch, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Senſe than any Mortal has yet been; and the eaſtern Stile would be literally applicable to Him, that <hi>all Poople, Nations and Languages ſhould ſerve Him.</hi>... And thus, for Inſtance, the wonderful Power and Proſperity promiſed to the Jewiſh Nation in the Scripture, would be, in a great meaſure the Conſequence of what is predicted of them that the People ſhould <hi>be all righteous and inherit the Land forever</hi>
                     </q>; Iſa 60 21.</p>
                  <p>See <hi>Butler's Analogy, p.</hi> 93, 94, 95</p>
               </note>. Indeed, 'tis the <hi>main Support</hi> and ſtrongeſt <hi>Bond</hi> of civil Societies. And therefore, to incourage and ſupport Religion is one of the <hi>greatest</hi> &amp; <hi>best</hi> Ends of Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:006430_0018_1028E8DE8EDF9248"/>ALL <hi>wiſe</hi> Governments therefore, have thôt, that it belong'd to them, to take Care of the Cauſe of Religion. Even the Heathen Governments, that have been fam'd for <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and that have flouriſh'd &amp; become great in the World, took Care of the <hi>Religious</hi> Intercfts of their People, &amp; incourag'd what they ſuppos'd to be <hi>Godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND where ever we find a Government in Scripture under the Direction of Heaven, we ſhall find <hi>this</hi> to be a great Part of the Buſineſs thereof. If we attentively read the Hiſtory of the Kings of GOD's ancient People, we ſhall find that thoſe Princes, who obtain'd the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>doing that which was right</hi> in the Sight of GOD, appear'd active in their <hi>publick Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi> for Religion; taking Care for the Support of the Miniſters of Religion, incouraging them to their Work; giving out Proclamations that the <hi>Ordinances of</hi> GOD be obſerved, and iſſuing out their Orders <hi>to pull down the Altars of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006430_0019_1028E8E289C42328"/>
ſtrange Gods,</hi> and <hi>the high Plates &amp; the Croves,</hi> which were diſallow'd of GOD, 2 Chron.14.3.</p>
            <p>AND to ſay, at ſome do, that GOD himſelf was the <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> and their Princes &amp; Powers but Officers under <hi>Him,</hi> thô it be true, doth not <hi>weaken</hi> the Argument; for Chriſt ſtill remains <hi>King in Zion,</hi> and the lawful Governours of his People are his Miniſters &amp; Officers, and rule for <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND therefore ſince the Coming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Preaching of his <hi>unſearchable Riches</hi> amongſt the Gentiles, where ever we have hid an Account of Nations chriſtianiz'd, and brôt to an <hi>Obedience to the Faith,</hi> and their Kings ſubmitting themſelves unto the Scepter <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> we find the <hi>high Powers</hi> becoming the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Church, and imploying their Power to maintain the Glory and Honour of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Kingdom amongſt their People.</p>
            <p>SO particularly <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt chriſtian Emperor eſtabliſh'd Chriſtianity throughout his Realm, and made it Part of his Buſineſs &amp; Care to incourage the <hi>Profeſſion &amp; Practice</hi> of Religion in all his Dominions.<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith concerning him, that ſitting at the Table with ſeveral Bishops, he ſaid to them, <q>You are Biſhops of the Church as to the Internals, and I am alſo conſtituted ſuch, as to Externals:</q> And much is ſaid of his watchful Care of the Church of GOD</note>.

What hath the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to do with the Church?

            </p>
            <p>So it was, 'till <hi>Popery</hi> lifted high it's formidable Head in the World, &amp; the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be Chriſt's <hi>Vicar</hi> upon Earth, veſted with Power over the Nations of the Earth, to rule them as <hi>with a Rod of Iron,</hi> and <hi>the World wondred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Beast, ſaying, Who is like unto the Beast?

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they allow'd Magiſtrates to have Nothing to do about Religion, but <hi>to give Life to the, Image of the Beast,</hi> to ſupport the Uſurpation of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and draw the Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, that were there condemn'd, and by them deliver'd over to the <hi>ſecular Arm.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>IT was then received as <hi>a Doctrine of Truth</hi> amongſt the <hi>reformed Churches,</hi> that it was Part of the Buſineſs of the Magiſtrate to take Care about the Worſhip of GOD, in their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; to guard &amp; defend the Churches, to provide that Houſes for Worſhip be built, the Miniſters of Chriſt maintained, their juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſupported, and Obedience to the Laws of CHRIST encouraged.</p>
            <p>IT was the common Doctrine of the <hi>Proteſtant Nations,</hi> that <hi>the civil Magiſtrate is the Keeper of both Tables of the Law.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>INDEED, if any Rulers ſhould be left <hi>to frame Miſchief by a Law,</hi> to command what GOD forbids, or forbid what GOD commands, in <hi>ſuch</hi> a Caſe, we eaſily conclude, as the Apoſtles did, when they were commanded to preach no more <hi>in the Name of Jeſus,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Whether it be right in the Sight of</hi> GOD, <hi>to bearken unto you, more than unto</hi> GOD, judge Ye, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19.

Context, v.2. <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>THE Doctrine of Obedience &amp; Subjection to Magiſtrates, hath doubtleſs been carried too far by thoſe, who allow the People to make no Reſiſtance, nor Self-Defence, under the moſt <hi>arbitrary</hi> &amp; <hi>illegal</hi> Abuſes of Power, but inſiſt, that they tamely ſit ſtill, and ſee their <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties, Religion</hi> &amp; <hi>Properties</hi> invaded under a Notion of Authority &amp; Power. — Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, when <hi>the whole Head is ſick,</hi> and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of a State are removed, when the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Powers become tyrannical &amp; arbitrary, and uſurp a Power that never was given them, and <hi>evidently</hi> go counter to the Inſtructions of that great <hi>Lord,</hi> by whom they rule, the Law of Self-Defence is in Force amongſt a People, and they may judge, that GOD is to be Obeyed rather than <hi>Man.</hi> But then, Men muſt be very careful, that, under pretence of the miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Powers, they don't <hi>uſurp</hi> an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to themſelves, which GOD hath not given them, and <hi>themſelves</hi> embroil the State, &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Foundations of Government. — And, whenever they refuſe Subjection to any Law of Man, they muſt ſee, that they have <hi>ſure</hi> Warrant therefore in the Word of GOD; that it interferes with ſome Command of GOD; for we are told, Context, v.2.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly; IN Order to ſupport Government <hi>we ſhould pray for thoſe in Authority. I exhort therefore,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>that firſf of all, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and Giving of Thanks be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead to quiet and peaceable Life in all Gcdlineſs and Honeſty,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2.</p>
            <p>As <hi>large</hi> Supplies of Grace are neceſſary, for the faithful Diſcharge of the Duties of their high Character; as their Work is <hi>difficult,</hi> and their Station attended with <hi>great</hi> Temptations; as the Welfare of their People is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Wiſdom &amp; Faithfulneſs of their Government: We ſhould <hi>ſtrive together</hi> in Prayer to GOD for them, that they may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly inrich'd with Grace, and indued with every needful Qualification, to be <hi>the Shields of the Earth,</hi> and Bleſſings in their Places; That they may be indued with that <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that <hi>is profitable to direct</hi>; that they may have <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Times, to know what</hi> Iſrael <hi>ought to do</hi>; that they may be indued with Courage to ſtand in their Stations, when GOD's <hi>Way is in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm, and the Clouds are the Dust of his Feet,</hi> that <hi>their Soul</hi> may not be <hi>melted becauſe of trouble,</hi> nor <hi>they reel to &amp; fro, and</hi> be <hi>at their Wits End,</hi> like

affrighted Mariners, when <hi>the ſtormy Wind</hi> is raiſed. In a Word, we are to pray that God would diſpoſe them to, qualify them for, and ſucceed them in the due Diſcharge of the Duties of their Station; that under their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, <hi>Judgment may run, down as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, end Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF we have any Intereſt in Heaven, any <hi>Power with GOD,</hi> we ſhould improve it in their Behalf: If <hi>effectual fervent Prayers</hi> any thing avail, we ſhould be importunate in our Interceſſion with GOD for them. For who, not aſſiſted of GOD, not ſtrengthned from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, <hi>is ſufficient</hi> for the Work, <hi>to the which they are called</hi>? A Work, the Difficulties whereof are proportionable to it's Dignity.</p>
            <p>HE <note n="†" place="bottom">The Arch Biſhop of <hi>Cambray.</hi>
               </note> was well acquainted with the Life and Buſineſs of Princes &amp; Rulers, who ſaid, <hi>Happy is he who is not oblig'd to command, the King has the leaſt Liberty and Repoſe of any Man in his Kingdom; ... is a Slave to all thoſe he ſeems to command;.. is burthen'd with all their Cares.</hi> The beſt of Rulers have ſomtimes, been almoſt overborn with the Burden &amp; Difficulty of their Work. The Murmurings and Jealouſies, the ill Humour &amp; Untractableneſs of their People have even diſcouraged their Hearts. Thus we find even the meek <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, diſcouraged,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006430_0038_1028DAAB0F65BA08"/>
and ſaying to GOD, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.11, 12 — <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bast thou afflicted thy Servant? and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I not found Favour in thy Sight, that thou layeſt the Burden of all this People upon me? Have I conceived all this People? Have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten them, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay unto me, carry them in thy Boſom....? I am not able to bear all this People alone, becauſe it is too heavy for me. And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of Hand.</hi> Now ſurely, we ſhould not ceaſe to pray for them, whoſe Buſineſs is ſo burden ſome &amp; full of Difficulties.</p>
            <p>AND then, their Station is attended with Temptations proportionally great unto the Dignity thereof. It oftentimes happens, that the Way to pleaſe the Multitude, is, to deſert the Cauſe of GOD, and betray the Intereſt of their Country: And, if they have Reſolution enough, to ſtem the Current of popular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and to endeavour, to the laſt, to prevent the Ruin a People would bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they will doubtleſs, be often cenſured and reproach'd, and evil intreated; all their Labour, Solicitude &amp; Care, for an unthankful People, being ill taken, and miſrepreſented. And can it be expected but that this ſhould try their Patience, anger their Spirits, if not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to retire like <hi>Elijah</hi> from their Poſt, ſaying as the Fig-Tree; in <hi>Jotham's</hi> Parable, (in <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.11.) <hi>Should I forſake my Sweetneſs,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006430_0039_1028E91514258438"/>
and my good Fruit, and go to be promoted over the Trees</hi>? Or as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.7. <hi>I will not be an Healer</hi>;.. <hi>make me not a Ruler of the People.</hi> We know <hi>Moſes</hi> himfelf was to provoked with the Murmurings and Complainings of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful People, <hi>that be ſpake unadviſedly with his Lips,</hi> and himſelf provoked GOD, <hi>ſo that it went ill with him,</hi> (Pſal. 106.32, 33.)</p>
            <p>BESIDES, we may conclude that the great Adverſary of Men, that <hi>goes to and fro in the Eartb, and walks up &amp; down in,</hi> ſeeking what Miſehief he may do, and <hi>Whom he may devour</hi> among Men, eſpecially endeavours to ſeduce thoſe, that are ſet in the higher Seats amongſt Men, as knowing that, <hi>if Rulers hearken to Lies,</hi> the People are in a fair Way, to become <hi>wicked,</hi> (Prov. 29.12.) and that the Corruption of a Man in Power is a wounding Blow to the People. And therefore we read, that when <hi>Satan ſtood up against</hi> Iſrael, he <hi>provoked</hi> David <hi>to number Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. His Deſign was to injure all the <hi>People,</hi> but his Endeavour was to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the <hi>Prince,</hi> in Order to affect it. And, if the Temptations of Rulers are ſo great, our Prayers ſhould be always aſcending before GOD in their Behalf.</p>
            <p>BUT having thus hinted at what, it is proper for a People to do in Support of Government, we are,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006430_0040_1028E916EB5AB970"/>
11dly; BRIEFLY <hi>to conſider Some of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations upon a People</hi> thus <hi>to endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Government.</hi> And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt; WE are under an Obligation to Support Government, <hi>as it is of</hi> GOD's <hi>own Ordination.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, v.1. of our Context, <hi>The Powers that be, are ordained of</hi> GOD. And ſurely it becomes us to ſupport that, which is of <hi>divine Appointment.</hi> Surely, as GOD <hi>himſelf</hi> hath raiſed Rulers on high for the good of Men, We are oblig'd, to do all we properly can, to ſupport their Dignity, and maintain their Character.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly; AN Obligation on us, to endeavour to ſupport Government, ariſes from <hi>the great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Benefit of it to the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the State of our World is, Government is abſolutely neceſſary for it's Well-Being; and there could be no tolerable Living without it: And therefore GOD hath in <hi>Compaſſion</hi> to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, appointed Government for their own Good, that they <hi>may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> As therefore we deſire the <hi>Welfare</hi> of Mankind; as we de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire the Bleſſings of <hi>Peace, Godlineſ</hi> &amp; <hi>Honeſty,</hi> it concerns us to ſupport Government.</p>
            <p>To be ſure, All, that wiſh well to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> will be Friends to Government; for; 'tis the <hi>ordinary</hi> Means GOD makes uſe of, to ſupport his Church in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:006430_0041_1028E91960C13160"/>INDEED, He, that is anointed King in <hi>Zion</hi> is able to protect his Church, if earthly Powers ſhould deſert it, and willingly ſee it labouring under all imaginable Diſcouragements, yea, raſed to the Foundation.</p>
            <p>AND therefore, when the civil Powers were Perſecutors of the Truth, as in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity; when they refus'd to exert their Power to protect the Church, and defend the Faith, yea, rather imploy'd their Power to pull down and deſtroy the ſame, yet the Church was upheld, to the Admiration &amp; aſtoniſhing Confuſion of her Enemies. The Lord alone was her Defence. As the Rulers of the World knew him not, his own almighty Arm, in a miraculous Way, brôt Salvation to his People.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince Chriſtianity is become the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of many Nations, and ſo many Princes have laid down their Scepters at the Feet of Chriſt, and as it were taken out their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions from Him, he is pleaſed to make theſe Powers his Miniſters to protect his Church.</p>
            <p>AND we may conclude, that, if amongſt the chriſtian Nations, their Rulers will not favour <hi>Zion,</hi> it is a Day of the Lord's Diſpleaſure with his People, and that the Lord is pleaſed to take away their Hedge and their Defence: And therefore we may expect, that it will be <hi>a Day of treading down in the Valley of Viſion,</hi> and of <hi>breaking down the Wells</hi> of Zion; Her <hi>Glory
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006430_0042_1028E91FA8B1C920"/>
will flie away like a Bird,</hi> and <hi>all they which paſs by the Way, will pluck her</hi>: Unruly Men will rend her in Pieces, deſtroy her Order, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urb her Peace, and deface her Beauty. <hi>The Boar out of the Wood</hi> will <hi>waſte her, and the wild Beast of the Field devour her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEN, indeed, there will be <hi>perillous Times,</hi> and <hi>evil Men and Seducers will wax worſe and &amp; worſe, deceiving, and being deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS we ſee that the ſpiritual, as well as the temporal Intereſts of Men, call upon us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſupport Government. So that for our <hi>own</hi> Sakes, for our <hi>Families</hi> and our <hi>Friends</hi> Sake, and for <hi>Zion's</hi> Sake, We ſhould contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute what in us lies, that Government may be maintained, incouraged &amp; ſupported amongſt us. But it is Time to come to the</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p n="1">I. LEARN hence, <hi>how thankful we ſhould be for Government</hi>; and eſpecially, <hi>if we are bleſs'd with faithful Rulers, that attend upon this very Thing, even to be Miniſters of GOD for Good to them that do well, and Revengers to execute Wrath upon them that do Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ALMOST any, even a <hi>tyrannous</hi> Government is better than none; becauſe, while the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is never ſo tyrannical, there are but a few cxerciſing that Tyranny: The Multitude are in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006430_0043_1028E921361E1870"/>
the mean Time under Reſtraint. Whereas, if there was no Government at all, <hi>every</hi> One would be let looſe to be a Tyrant; and every domineering Wretch would ſet up his own Will for a Law, to which he would demand Obedience from Others, and inflict what Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the Diſobedient thereunto, his Malice ſhould dictate, and his Arm could execute: So that no Man could be ſecure. <hi>Fear, and the Pit, and the Snare</hi> would be upon all; and that Text in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.22. would be in the moſt literal fenſe fulfilled amongſt them, <hi>This is a People robbed and ſpoiled, they are all of them ſnared in holes, and they are hid in priſon-houſes; They are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a ſpoil, and none ſaith reſtore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Luſts and Paſſions of Men are ſuch, that if entirely left looſe, to themſelves, without any Reſtraint of Govcrnment, the World it ſelf would ſcarce be a habitable Place, but rather a confuſed Scene of Intemperance, Lewdneſs, Oppreſſion, Robbery, Murder, and all Manner of Exorbitances. <hi>By Reafon of the Multitude cf Oppreſſions, they</hi> would <hi>make the Oppreſſed to crie; Violence and Spoil</hi> would be <hi>heard</hi> in the Midſt of them, and <hi>Grief and Wounds</hi> be <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually before</hi> them. So that any Government is better than None.</p>
               <p>BUT by how much the better, the Deſigns of Government are anſwered, by how much
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006430_0044_1028E923116ADCC0"/>
the more, the Bleſſings of Peace, and Godlineſs and Honeſty are promoted by the Powers that be, by how much the more, the Vices deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the World are reſtrain'd, and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereby; So much the more Reaſon have a People to rejoice in the Bleſſings of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be thankful therefor.</p>
               <p>'Tis Matter therefore of great Thankfulneſs, when any are favour'd with a <hi>legal</hi> well conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Government, ſuch as that of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions, perhaps the beſt in any, of the Nations of the Earth.</p>
               <p>IT is therefore Matter of Wonder, that ſo many, who have ſat fo <hi>ſecurely</hi> under the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of ſo <hi>excellent</hi> a Government, and enjoy'd ſo many <hi>Liberties</hi> and valuable <hi>Bleſſings</hi> under the Same, have been diſpos'd to rebel, and to exchange ſo <hi>good</hi> a Government for <hi>Bondage</hi> and <hi>Slavery.</hi>

               <p>AND we have Reaſon to <hi>bleſs</hi> and to <hi>praiſe</hi> the <hi>most high</hi> GOD, <hi>that ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will,</hi> that thoſe Sons of Rebellion have <hi>not</hi> been able <hi>to perform their Enterprise,</hi> but that the happy Eſtabliſhment ſtill remains.

                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:006430_0045_1028E924A323BA40"/>'Tis an unſpeakable Favour of Heaven alſo, when a People are favour'd with ſuch Rulers, who are diſpos'd to <hi>miniſter for Good</hi> unto them; who <hi>attend upon this</hi> very <hi>Thing,</hi> to anſwer to the good Deſigns of Government, to ſecure Men in the Enjoyment of their Liberties and Poſſeſſions; to maintain Truth &amp; Peace; Who eſpouſe the Cauſe of Chriſt, eſtabliſh the true Religion, uphold the pure Worſhip of GOD, ſupport the Miniſters of Religion, make Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Doers afraid, and encourage thoſe that do well.

be wondred at, if, oftentimes, Men are ſet over them in Places of Rule and Authority, not ſo equal thereunto, nor ſo well qualified to ſuſtain ſuch Characters: For it is a rare thing, when Men are ſo concerned for Others Welfare as their own.

David, the Man who was raiſed up on high, the anointed of the GOD of Jacob, ſaid, yea, the Spirit of the Lord ſpake by him, and the</hi> GOD <hi>of Iſrael ſaid, He that ruleth over Men must be</hi> juſt, ruling in the Fear of GOD, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3.</p>
               <p>IT can't be expected, that Men deſtitute of Religion, will faithfully ſtand in their Station, and employ their Power, as much as may be,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006430_0049_1028E988DE203050"/>
to anſwer the great Deſigns of Government. Will they, who <hi>themſelves</hi> are deſtitute of the Principles of Vertue and Righteouſneſs, lay out themſelves to encourage the Cauſe of Vertue, and be a Terrour to Evil-Doers? Will they, in earneſt, maintain the Cauſe of GOD, who themſelves are no Friends thereto, nor have <hi>the Love of God dwelling in</hi> them?</p>
               <p>Is it likely, that ſuch will ſtand Steady in the Cauſe of Zion, if a Time of Temptation ſhould come on, and they might thereby increaſe the Number of their Enemies, or diſadvantage ſome appearing Intereſt in the World? No, there is greater Reaſon to expect, they will ſwim with the Tide, and be carried away with the Stream of the Times, and behave ſo as to ſecure their <hi>private</hi> Intereſts, and render themſelves <hi>popular,</hi> whatever becomes of the Cauſe of GOD in the World.</p>
               <p>THERE is no rational Proſpect, that ſuch, who are not <hi>themſelves</hi> Lovers of GOD, his People, his Houſe, the Ordinances &amp; Miniſters thereof, will lay out themſelves to protect the People of GOD, to defend the Faith, to ſupport the Worſhip of GOD, to incourage the Hearts, and ſtrengthen the Hands of the Miniſters of Religion. — Did I ſay, <hi>there was no rational Proſpect of this</hi>? I might have ſaid, that, it is a thouſand Times likelier, ſuch will deſert the Cauſe of GOD, and leave his Church to be
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006430_0050_1028E92FC100DDD0"/>
trampled on, devoured and waſted by all her Adverſaries, and the Houſe of GOD to go to Ruin; and abandon the Miniſters of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary; yea, and help to make their Burden heavy, and themſelves contribute to weaken their Hands, and diſcourage their Hearts.</p>
               <p>OR, if they will ſmile upon the Practice of Piety, and cheriſh the Worſhip &amp; Worſhippers of GOD, ſo long as it comes not acroſs their Intereſt in the World, yet except they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the Principles of Grace &amp; Religion, there is but little Ground to hope they will be valiant for the Truth, and in the Cauſe of the Churches, or ſtedfaſt in the Defence thereof, if once they ſhould look upon that a <hi>ſinking</hi> Cauſe in the World, and ſee the Enemies of the Welfare of Zion the <hi>riſing</hi> Party: And thai: Promotion is likely to be found amongſt them, 'Tis likelier they will ſerve the <hi>Times,</hi> and keep in with the riſing Side. We ſee therefore, of how great Importance it is, that Men of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be choſen to rule over us.</p>
               <p>BUT here, Such, as are concern'd in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Rulers over them, are to be caution'd that they don't judge amiſs as to Mens being reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. Some have placed Religion, almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, in <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> Raptures, Impulſes, and <hi>warm Imaginations,</hi> which it is poſſible for a Man to abound with, who hath Nothing of the Fear of GOD: But the Pſalmiſt directs on
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006430_0051_1028E93323A78C58"/>
whom our Eyes ſhould be as Men of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.6. Scil. <hi>the Faithful in tie Land, that walk in a perfect Way.</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Hearts are out of our View, but thoſe that, to Appearance, pay the higheſt Regards to the weightier Matters of the Law, <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mercy, Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD, ſhould be in our Eſteem <hi>the Excellent of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, they ſhould be <hi>Men of Truth</hi>: Men of Integrity &amp; Uprightneſs; of Honour and Sincerity.</p>
               <p>AND <hi>finally,</hi> they ſhould be Men <hi>hating Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs</hi>: Men of a publick Spirit, whoſe Views &amp; Deſigns are generous and noble, not little and ſelfiſh, and contracted within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their own private Intereſt &amp; Advantage. They ſhould be Men of a great, a generous and diſintereſted Spirit. It is not for their <hi>own</hi> Sake, that Men are exalted to Places of Power, but it is for the <hi>Service</hi> of the People: So that they ſhould be Men, that prefer the publick Good to their own perſonal Intereſts.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. WE may alſo infer from this Diſcourſe, <hi>the great Evil and Danger of deſpiſing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſpeaktng Evil of Dignities.</hi> We have heard that Government is of GOD: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he, that <hi>reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of</hi> GOD; ſo they, that deſpiſe and make light of Government, offer an Affront to

GOD's own Majeſty, in whoſe Name it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and by whoſe Authority all earthly Powers rule. And GOD himſelf will ſooner or later, ariſe &amp; vindicate his deſpis'd Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and call to an Account the <hi>Sons of Men,</hi> that have dar'd to deſpiſe or revile the <hi>God's,</hi> his Repreſentatives upon Earth.</p>
               <p>IT cannot be ſafe to inſult, and rudely treat thoſe that bear GOD's Name, and are his anointed Ones in the Earth. And therefore, a <hi>Wo</hi> is denounced againſt thoſe <hi>Murmurers and Complainers,</hi> that <hi>deſpiſe Dominion,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude</hi>; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that ſuch are eſpecially <hi>reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto the Day of Judgment to be puniſhed,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.9, 10.</p>
               <p>BUT yet, <hi>Seditious</hi> Men and <hi>Male-Contents</hi> are ready to imagine, many Times, they are ſerving the Cauſe of GOD, and their Country, and doing well, all the Time, they are ſowing the Seeds of Faction; reviling <hi>the Powers that be,</hi> and fomenting Jealouſies of them amongſt the People.</p>
               <p>THEY imagine they are weak, or deſigning, or partial Men, that are at the Helm of the Government: And their high Conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtrengthens them herein. They imagine that <hi>themſelves are the People, and Wiſdom ſhall die with them</hi>: that their Thoughts are juſt, their Schemes perfect; and that, were but the

Publick Affairs managed according to their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Things would go well</hi> But yet they are neglected, and not promoted as, they think their Merit calls for, nor are their Schemes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by the ruling Powers, as they think they ought to be. They imagine therefore, that they are not only too much neglected, but the Country is ruin'd: And that therefore they muſt, in Faithfulneſs, raiſe a Cry againſt thoſe in Authority, and expoſe their Faults.</p>
               <p>BUT Men had need conſider <hi>what manner of Spirit they are of,</hi> in all this, and to take heed that their <hi>Hearts carry</hi> them not <hi>away,</hi> while they <hi>let ſuch</hi> complaining <hi>Words go out of</hi> their <hi>Mouths</hi>; and remember that Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28 <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods, nor curſe the Ruler of thy People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT it is high Time to come to a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Application,</hi> in an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to the <hi>ſundry</hi> Orders of Men, that are now aſſembled before the Lord, in this Houſe.</p>

               <p>I SHALL therefore, with <hi>Freedom,</hi> thô with <hi>Deference</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> to your <hi>high</hi> Characters, apply this Diſcourſe to <hi>You</hi>; and moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend it to your <hi>Honour,</hi> and all the honourable <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>General Aſſembly, to attend upon this very Thing,</hi> even to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Welfare of this People, and to be <hi>Miniſters of</hi> GOD <hi>unto them for Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD hath ordained Dominion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not for the Grandure of <hi>Rulers,</hi> but the Good of the People: And Power is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be reckon'd as a Perfection, than as it is the <hi>Instrument</hi> of doing Good.</p>

               <p>OH! be faithful then to that great LORD, whoſe Image you bear, whoſe Miniſters you are, and to whom you muſt give an Account, what you have done in your high Characters, as his Repreſentatives on Earth.</p>

               <p>YOUR <hi>Honours</hi> are ſenſible, that Our <hi>Medium of Exchange</hi> is, at leaſt, the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of, and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> for a great Deal of Unrighteouſneſs. Let a Man's Demand for any Neceſſary, he hath to ſpare to his Neighbour, be never ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,

let him never ſo much <hi>grind the Faces of the Poor</hi> thereby, his Excuſe is, <hi>The Money is fallen</hi>; On the other Hand, however great hath been the Diſcount, ſince a Debt hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, the Man pretends he does well, if he pays the ſame Number of <hi>Pounds</hi> or <hi>Shillings</hi> he contracted for. By which Means Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs hath ſtood <hi>afar off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOTHING is more evident than that our <hi>Paper Mediuum</hi> hath been, at leaſt in this Way, an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of Unrighteouſneſs. It hath been an <hi>uncertain Meaſure</hi> and <hi>Standard</hi>; and ſo a <hi>Stumbling Block</hi> to the People, and the Cauſe of a great Deal of Evil. It has put an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage into the Hands of Cheats &amp; Knaves; incourag'd People to continue in Debt: And has as an Occaſion, at leaſt, <hi>made the People to ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Country hath now been groaning, <hi>many Years,</hi> under the Injuſtice, that hath by this Means, been <hi>common</hi> in the Land. Some have been ſpoiled hereby, 'tis probable, of the better <hi>Half</hi> of their Subſtance: And the Burden hath eſpecially, fallen upon <hi>Orphans,</hi> and Pcrſons that ought to be treated with eſpecial Care and Tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>I DOUBT not therefore, but it was agreeable to the Mind of the LORD, that His Prophets and <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould teſtify againſt <hi>theſe Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi> and the <hi>Occaſion</hi> thereof, which hath ſo
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006430_0063_1028E9516DB47850"/>
made the People to Sin. And accordingly, I think no Miniſter hath appeared in the <hi>Lord's Meſſage,</hi> upon ſuch an Occaſion as the preſent, for <hi>ſome Years,</hi> but who hath cried out againſt the uncertain Medium, as an Occaſion of a great Part of the Injuſtice and Extravagance in the Land. They have thought it their Duty, to plead for <hi>GOD</hi> and their <hi>Country</hi> with the <hi>Legiſlature,</hi> who alone, they ſuppos'd had it in their Power to redreſs ſo great an Evil, to ariſe and deliver the People from this <hi>Temptation</hi> to Injuſtice.</p>
               <p>AND now, it is not for <hi>me</hi> to pretend to <hi>know,</hi> or <hi>ſay,</hi> wherefore our <hi>honourable Rulers</hi> have not redreſſed this Evil. I am not inclin'd to believe, that they diſregard the <hi>Intreaties</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I SUPPOSE therefore, that the great Difficulty of fixing a <hi>Paper</hi> Medium upon any <hi>ſtable</hi> Foundation, and the different Sentiments of <hi>wiſe Men,</hi> as to what may be the moſt effectual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, to fix the Medium, may be the Reaſon, that as yet it hath been left undone.</p>
               <p>BUT we hope, O <hi>Ye Fathers of our Country,</hi> that no Difficulties attending this Matter will diſcourage you from doing Something to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

               <p>HER <hi>Tears are an her Cheeks,</hi> ſhe <hi>weepeth ſore,</hi> and cries for Compaſſion: And let me, in <hi>her Name</hi> and Behalf, intreat your Help before ſhe be utterly ruin'd and undone. <hi>How is the faithful City</hi> already <hi>become an Harlot!

And can we expect that Juſtice wil re-enter amongſt us, or Judgment overtake us, 'till a <hi>fixed</hi> Medium or Standard of commutative Juſtice be reſtor'd to us? And if not, will not <hi>the Lord ſee it, and be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed that there is no Judgment</hi>?</p>
               <p>LET me then with <hi>humble Importunity</hi> preſs it upon You, <hi>honoured Gentlemen,</hi> you would be <hi>dear</hi> to your Country, and be ſtiled the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers</hi> thereof, as you would reſcue the ſame from Ruin, and <hi>ſtand in the Breach before the Lord, to turn away his Wrath, lest be ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> the Land; to find out, if poſſible, ſome Remedy for this great Calamity, and ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to remove this Stumbling-Block in the Way of your People.</p>

               </p>
               <p>You will ſuffer me therefore, <hi>Ye Heads and Fathers of this People,</hi> to beſeech You in <hi>the Name of Chriſt,</hi> for whom <hi>you rule,</hi> and for whom <hi>I ſpeak,</hi> to employ all your Power to Defend his Church, and advance his Kingdom: <q>To give Vigour to the Diſcipiine of his Houſe <note n="‖" place="bottom">This is not to be underſtood, as if Perſons proceeded againſt in the Church were to be deliver'd over to <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>'Tis a Day, in which you are called to ſhew your <hi>Zeal for the Lord</hi>: A Day, in which we have Reaſon to remember <hi>the Words, which were ſpoken before, by the Apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Christ</hi>; who foretold, that <hi>there ſhould be Mockers in the last Time, who ſhould walk after their own ungodly Laſts</hi>; Men, <hi>who</hi> would <hi>ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the Spirit,</hi> (Jude 17, 18, 19.) A Day, in which the <hi>Lord's Name and Day</hi> are openly prophaned, and the Worſhip of GOD is contemned, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his <hi>Sanctuary</hi> are miſuſed, and ſet at nought.</p>

                  <hi>Lord's Day.</hi> I would humbly recommend it to your wife Reconſideration, whether the <hi>Sanction</hi> of your Law, made to ſecure the Honour of the Sabbath, be proportion'd to the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Thing; whether it bears heavy enough upon Sabbath-Breakers: Who ſeem to be greatly increaſed amongſt us.</p>
               <p>Be intreated alſo to <hi>ſpeak comfortably</hi> to the <hi>Meſſengers of Cbrist,</hi> in this Day of treading down; when they are exceedingly filled with Contempt; and their Temptations are ſtrong to abandon themſelves to Grief, and forſake their Charge, as <hi>Elijah</hi> when he retired into the Wilderneſs: And too many are forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to ſome <hi>ſecular</hi> Employment for their Bread. And can you do nothing more for their Support &amp; Encouragement?</p>
               <p>I HAVE often thought, that the preſent Way of ſupporting our Miniſters by a <hi>Rate,</hi> granted by the reſpective <hi>Pariſhes</hi> or <hi>Societies,</hi> is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many Inconveniences, and that the Danger is <hi>very</hi> great, left the Ruin of our Churches enter in at this Door.</p>
               <p>NOT that I have any Doubt about the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of this Way of their Support,<note n="*" place="bottom">And if any queſtion the Righteouſneſs of ſo ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Miniſters of the Goſpel, I believe they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain abundant Satisfaction in this matter, by reading a late ingeni us Piece, in way of <hi>A Dialogue between</hi> John Quenſticus <hi>and</hi> Thomas Caſuiſticus.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:006430_0068_1028E95F6FF48CE0"/>BUT as the State of the World is, many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes rather inquire how good a Bargain they can make with their Miniſter, to how low Terms they can bring him; than what will be an honourable Support &amp; Maintenance for him: And the ſettling Miniſter is obliged to look to himſelf, that he may have a rational Proſpect of ſuch a Support, as will enable him to ſwqueſter his Time to the Work of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry. And then he is look'd upon, by <hi>Many,</hi> as aiming only at <hi>Money</hi> and a <hi>Living.</hi> And perhaps after all his Care, the State of the Time ſo changes, as that what he contracted for, will not anſwer his Neceſſities; and he muſt complain of the Deficiency thereof to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Who are generally incompetent Judges in this Matter. And ſuppoſe a Majority will allow any tolerable Maintainance; yet Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers and Complainers are, for the moſt Part, multiplied; and, oftentimes, ſome turn away from the Communion of our Churches to avoid the Charge.</p>
               <p>WHILST the Country was ſmall, and a Spirit of Love &amp; Religion, and Reverence to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Sanctuary remained, there was no Difficulty in this Matter. But as the Country has <hi>increaſed,</hi> Religion <hi>declined,</hi> and the primitive <hi>Zeal of God's</hi> Houſe ccaſed, and <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, this Matter hath grown more &amp; more difficult: And will, doubtleſs, ſtill grow more ſo.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:006430_0069_1028E96253CC5048"/>So that unleſs there be ſome <hi>ſettled Funds,</hi> or <hi>Proviſion</hi> for the Support of the Miniſters of Religion, as in other Countries, under the Care and Direction of the Government, I am afraid our Churches will gradually ſink and crumble into Pieces; and our Sanctuaries be brôt into Deſolation.</p>
               <p>I WOULD therefore humbly recommend it unto your Honour's Conſideration, whether it be not <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>best,</hi> that the Houſe &amp; Worſhip of GOD be ſupported, <hi>more directly,</hi> at the <hi>Charge,</hi> and by <hi>Direction</hi> of the Government.</p>
               <p>BUT leaving this Matter with your <hi>Honours,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I WOULD beg Leave further to plead before <hi>your Honours,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of theſe Churches.</p>
               <p>IT would trouble me, to doubt of the Love or Zeal of any of this <hi>honourable Ajſſmbly</hi> to the Conſtitution of theſe Churches; which <hi>your Laws</hi> eſtabliſh: A Conſtitution very dear to our Fathers; under which they enjoyed <hi>great Quietneſs</hi> for many Years; and had much of the Preſence of Heaven with them.</p>
               <p>WE <hi>accept it with all Thankfulneſs,</hi> that our Civil Fathers have made ſuch a Hedge &amp; Wall of Defence round it; and manifeſted their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the Practices, <q>
                     <hi>which have a Tendency to deſtroy it.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT then, as Many are the Enemies of our Conſtitution, and are endeavouring to break
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006430_0070_1028E9650BDD8578"/>
down all the Hedges about it; we hope that you will not withdraw your Hands from the Defence thereof; but ſteadily Support the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution you have ſo <hi>juſtly</hi> eſtabliſh'd: Which is excellent in <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and ſeems to be the <hi>only</hi> probable Means to ſupport our Churches, and preſerve Religion in them, and prevent their utter Ruin.</p>
               <p>I WOULD not plead againſt the Toleration of ſober Diſſenters: But then we expect, that, whilſt Diſſenters from the Conſtitution enjoy only the Benefits and Privileges implyed in a Toleration, the Conſtitution it ſelf be ſupported and eſtabliſh'd: That you make a Difference between the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> Churches and thoſe that are only tolerated <note n="‡" place="bottom">Every one is ſenſible that it is one thing to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, another thing to tolerate any eccleſiaſtical Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Sundry Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions may be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one Government; and it may be fit &amp; prudent that they be ſo. But there can but one Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution enjoy the Benefit of a civil Eſtabliſhment. For ſhould any State or Government determine to eſtabliſh Two, or more diſtinct Sorts of Churches, &amp; equally to ſupport them, &amp; endue each of them with equal Grants &amp; Privileges, the Protection either of them would enjoy from the Government, would be very little more than is implied in a Toleration. For whilſt one Sort of theſe Churches was endeavouring with all their Might, to deſtroy the Other; encouraging their Members, when under any Diſcipline or Cenſure <hi>at Home,</hi> to come for Shelter &amp; Refuge to them; the Churches ſo endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy the Others, and weaken their Diſcipline, would enjoy all the civil Protection, Encouragement &amp; Privileges, as the Churches they would ruin; and every offending Perſon would have this Encouragement to withdraw from the Church he belong'd unto, that if he can be countenanced in the other Churches &amp; avoid a juſt Cenſure, he ſhall enjoy all che civil Protection &amp; Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges he could do, if reconciled to the Church to which he belongs If the Churches frown upon him, the Civil Magiſtrate would ſmile on him. Happy then is it for <hi>Connecticut,</hi> that our Churches have agreed to walk by One Rule; and notwithſtanding ſome leſſen Differences, are united in the <hi>Say Brook</hi> Agreement, Which therefore our Legiſlature have eſtabliſhed as the Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution of this Colony. Indeed I am ſurprized to hear any Gentlemen aſſerting, that the <hi>ſcongregation of Churches</hi> of this Colony are diſtinct from the Churches united in the <hi>happy</hi> Agreement: For the moſt of our Churches <hi>always</hi> were and ſtill remain <hi>congregational</hi> Churches under this Agreement. But ſee this Matter ſet in a true Light in the <hi>Defence of the Doings of the Reverend Conſociation and Aſſociation of New Haven County,</hi> &amp;c</note>. And we hope, that the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:006430_0071_1028E96793BD44B8"/>
Enemies of our Conſtitution and religious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts will Obtain nothing, by any of their Craft, from our Lcgiſlature, that ſhall have even the remoteſt Tendency to weaken, or deſtroy our Conſtitution. For, if this our Defence be taken from us, and they are encouraged that are pulling it down, we are doubleſs an undone People! And our Glory will <hi>fail</hi>; yea be <hi>turned into Shame</hi>!</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:006430_0072_1028E96A461140D0"/>FINALLY, let me intreat your Care of the Cauſe of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Education.</hi> The Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of a People much depends upon this: Which is therefore juſtly a Matter of publick Care and Encouragement. Let the Education of Children therefore, in all your Towns, be the Subject of your conſtant Regard: And let that publick Seminary of Learning, that has hitherto been ſo much of a Bleſſing, be kindly ſupported and cheriſhed, and put under the beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, to train up the Sons of your People for <hi>publick Uſefulneſs,</hi> in Church and State.</p>

How weighty and important therefore is the Work, whereunto we are called?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:006430_0074_1028E97126D74878"/>AND many are the Difficulties of this Work? <hi>Who is ſufficient,</hi> ſaid the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, <hi>for theſe Things</hi>?

               <p>BUT yet, as we are employed in the Service of <hi>Christ</hi> for the Good of Men, who will accept of, and reward our <hi>faithful</hi> Endeavours to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Kingdom in the World, and to do Good to the Souls of Men; let no Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Difficulties, no Hardſhip or Ill-Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment take us off from a <hi>ſervent</hi> Proſecution of our Work and <hi>Duty.</hi> Let no Abuſes, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, nor any <hi>of the Sufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Time</hi> move us from, or abate our Diligence in the Work <hi>whereunto</hi> we are <hi>called.</hi> Let us learn to ſay with the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20.24. <hi>None of theſe Things move me; neither count I my Life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my Courſe with Joy, and the Miniſtry which I

We ſhall be <hi>unto GOD a ſweet Savour of Christ, in them that are ſaved,</hi> and in them that periſh, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 15) <hi>Thô Iſrael be not gathered, yet</hi> our <hi>Judgment is with the</hi> LORD, <hi>and</hi> our <hi>Work with</hi> our GOD, and We <hi>ſhall be glorious in the Eyes of the</hi> LORD, and <hi>ſhall ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and the Stars for ever and ever,</hi> (<hi>Iſa.,</hi> 49 4, 5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3.) That everlaſting Glory, that Christ will confer upon us, will, ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Times over, recompence all our Labour &amp; Pains, all our Services, and Trials, in fulfilling <hi>our Miniſtry.</hi> Let us therefore <hi>faint not,</hi> nor be <hi>weary in</hi> our Minds, but <hi>be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Christ Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>endure Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as <hi>good Soldiers of Jeſus Christ</hi>: And let our Zeal and our Endeavours, to ſerve the Cauſe of Christ and the Souls of Men, be as great as our Difficulties and Trials be.</p>
               <p>PARTICULARLY, <hi>my venerable Fathers and deerly reſpected Brethren,</hi> as we are <hi>ſet for the Defence of the</hi> Goſpel, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.17.) and are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as <hi>Watchmen</hi> upon the Walls of our <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to <hi>give Warning</hi> (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17.) to

                  <hi>our People</hi> of any Danger they may be in, let us be faithful to caution and warn our People againſt all hurtful Errors and Practices.</p>
               <p>IT is ſadly evident, that a Spirit of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Diſorder</hi> hath gone forth in our Land, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily broken &amp; divided our Churches; and <hi>many fooliſh and hurtful</hi> Errors, <hi>which</hi> tend to <hi>drown Men in Deſtruction and Perdition</hi> are propagated. Let us faithfully Endeavour to diſcover to our People the dangerous Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theſe Things. Let us put on <hi>Courage,</hi> and cry aloud againſt the Errors of the Times, thô we be eſteem'd by many their <hi>Enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we tell</hi> them <hi>the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I AM afraid we have been too ſlow in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing againſt the Errors of the Times; that we have been too ready to excuſe our ſelves from ſpeaking plainly and freely in the Cauſe of Truth. But let us <hi>wax bold,</hi> and <hi>as we are allowed of God to be put in Truſt with the Goſpel, even ſo</hi> let us <hi>ſpeak, not as pleaſing Men, but</hi> GOD, <hi>which trieth our Hearts,</hi> (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4)</p>
               <p>INDEED we ſhall do well to avoid all <hi>Strife about Words to no Profit, but to the ſubverting of the Hearers,</hi> and <hi>fooliſh &amp; unlearned Queſtions that gender Strife,</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14, 23.) And it is becoming our Character, that we <hi>ſtrive not; but be gentle unto all Men; in Meekneſs inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe that oppoſe themſelves; if God perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:006430_0077_1028E97749546998"/>
will give them Repentance to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleging of the Truth,</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25.)</p>
               <p>BUT yet, when we ſee our People <hi>departing from the Faith, giving Heed to ſeducing Spirits</hi>; when we ſee them <hi>as Children toſſed to and fro, &amp; carried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the Slight of Men, and cunning Craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive</hi>; when we obſerve Men <hi>cauſing Diviſions &amp; Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which</hi> we <hi>have learned, and by good Words &amp; fair Speeches deceiving the Hearts of the Simple</hi>; it becomes us to appear openly and boldly for God; to warn our People of their Danger, &amp; ſhew them the <hi>Paths of the Deſtroyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MOREOVER, let us <hi>put</hi> our People <hi>in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates,</hi> according to the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p>I HAVE heard it caſt as a Reproach upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi> that they have been the <hi>foremost</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Principles of Sedition, and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Authority. I am perſwaded the Charge is unjuſt: And hope, the Inſtances are but few, of thoſe that have given any Occaſion for ſuch a Charge <note n="†" place="bottom">I ſuppoſe ſome Miniſters. under the Power of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> repreſenting the Leaders &amp; Rulers of this People, as <hi>unconverted &amp; Oppoſers</hi> of the Work of God, and uſurping an Authority that did not belong to them, was the Occaſion of this Charge. And I make no Doubt but it had an unhappy Influence upon the People, and encouraged many to <hi>deſpiſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſpeak Evil of Dignitieſ.</hi> But yet it is unfair to Object this to the Clergy in general.</note>

                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:006430_0078_1028E978EFAF7178"/>FOR, as civil Government is of GOD, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd out of Compaſſion to Mankind, and as a Bleſſing to the World, it becomes thoſe, whom God hath ordain'd to teach the People the Things of their Peace, and the Will of GOD, to practiſe themſelves, and teach their People Loyalty and Obedience to Magiſtrates.

               <p>AND indeed, ſeeing <hi>the Powers that be, are of</hi> GOD, and rule for Him, I need not call to Remembrance our Obligation to teach Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection thereunto: I ſhall only therefore <hi>ſtir up</hi> our <hi>Minds</hi> by the Conſideration of the <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of the Times.</hi> It is eaſy to obſerve a levelling and ſeditious Spirit prevailing, and an Impatience of all Rule and Reſtraint. <hi>Alas for the Day</hi>!

being <hi>the Servants of Corruption</hi>? O let us warn our People of the dangerous <hi>Tendency</hi> of ſuch a Spirit, &amp; preſs it upon them, to <hi>ſubmit themſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake</hi>; and let them know that <hi>ſo is the Will of</hi> GOD.</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, let it be our united Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>to keep the unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi> The better we are united, the greater will be our Influence on our People, and the greater Advantage we ſhall be under to ſerve them in their beſt Intereſts.</p>
               <p>'Tis Matter of Mourning &amp; Lamentation, that the primitive Union &amp; Harmony, that ſo many Years ſubſiſted amongſt us, have been ſo interrupted of late.

               <p>AND Oh! that GOD would unite our Hearts in his Work; that we might all join together in Defence of the Order &amp; Truth of the Goſpel, and in promoting the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the Good of Men, and in bearing Teſtimony againſt the Iniquities of a wicked World, and the Errors of the Times.</p>
               <p>LET us then, <hi>put on Charity, which is the Bond of Perfectneſs;</hi> (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.14.) and take heed that we do not entertain <hi>Jealouſies</hi> &amp; evil Surmiſings of one another; and that there be no more <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> &amp; <hi>Diviſionſ,</hi> no more <hi>Alienations</hi> and <hi>Strangeneſs</hi> amongſt our ſelves.</p>
