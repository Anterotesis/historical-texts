         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REMARKS ON THE Way &amp; End of the Wicked. After the Execution of the Pirates. 29 d. V. m. 1723</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOB XXII. 15.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Hast thou marked the Old Way, which Wicked Men have trodden?</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT ſeems, there has in all Ages been ſuch a <hi>Way.</hi> And the <hi>Way</hi> is in <hi>Ours</hi> as much <hi>trodden</hi> as ever. Yea, we have newly ſeen a formidable Exhibition of the <hi>Way,</hi> and of the End which the <hi>Way</hi> will bring unto. But there are things to be <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in the <hi>Way.</hi> There are many <hi>Remarkables</hi> in the <hi>Way.</hi> It may be a thing of <hi>Good Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> yea, tis a thing of the <hi>Laſt Importance,</hi> for us to take notice of them. We will this day <hi>Mark the Way that Wicked Men have trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> And indeed; this will be one proof that we do not <hi>take</hi> the <hi>Way.</hi> To <hi>Mark</hi> the way which <hi>Wicked Men do take,</hi> is a <hi>Step</hi> which <hi>Wicked</hi> Men do not uſe to <hi>take.</hi> Tis a <hi>Step</hi>

that would have a Tendency to bring them and keep them out of that <hi>way</hi> This made <hi>Eliphaz</hi> afraid that <hi>Job</hi> had fail'd in this point. He Feared, That <hi>Job</hi> had been tainted with this Impiety, To <hi>Forget</hi> that the Moſt High God, whoſe Throne is in the Heavens did <hi>mark the Ways</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> or take any cogniſance of what they did in the world. This produced a Fear in him, That <hi>Job</hi> did not <hi>Mark the Ways of Wicked Men.</hi> For this <hi>Forgetfulneſs</hi> is one <hi>art</hi> and <hi>Cauſe</hi> of their <hi>wicked Ways</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the DOCTRINE which I have now before me is this.</p>

The <hi>Way of Wicked Men,</hi> lies both in <hi>Wicked Opinions</hi> &amp; in <hi>Wicked Practices.</hi> There are thoſe <hi>Opinions,</hi> which are called, 2 Pet. 3. 17. <hi>The Error of the Wicked.</hi> Falſe <hi>Opinions;</hi> Thoſe <hi>Wrong Thoughts,</hi> which will hinder men from the <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> of God, which He has made neceſſary for us.

            <p>Firſt.

The World had not been begun long before the <hi>Way of Sin</hi> was taken up.

               </q> But then, the way of Sin is very <hi>old.</hi> In the <hi>Sinful ways</hi> of men, to ſeek after a Felicity in things under the Sun, here tis that it has been ſaid, <hi>There is no New Thing under the Sun.</hi> Tis no <hi>New Thing</hi> for men to Sin againſt God.

The very <hi>firſt man,</hi> that was born into the World, proved a <hi>wicked man.</hi> Of Wicked men in our Days, We read, Jud. 11. <hi>They have gone in the way of Cain.</hi> The <hi>Nature</hi> of Man was <hi>betimes</hi> depraved with corruption. Ah, Mankind, How <hi>Early didſt thou riſe, &amp; corrupt all thy Doings?</hi> Men have <hi>naturally</hi> taken the way of Sin, ever ſince our <hi>Firſt Fall</hi> from God.

            <p>Fourthly. There is this to be <hi>Marked</hi> in the <hi>way that wicked men have trodden;</hi> Men are <hi>Deceived</hi> all the way; it is a very <hi>Deceitful</hi> way We read, Prov. 11. 18. <hi>The wicked worketh a deceitful work.</hi> A wicked man is drawn into his <hi>way,</hi> with many <hi>Promiſes</hi> which the <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> make unto him.

            </p>
            <p>And you may <hi>Mark</hi> this one <hi>Deceit</hi> more, than which there is hardly any more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, in the Way of a wicked man, He is <hi>deceived</hi> about the <hi>Nature,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Period</hi> of his Way. He is not apprehenſive, <hi>what</hi> he is a doing, &amp; <hi>where</hi> he is a going. He apprehends no other, but that he may take this Way, &amp; yet not miſs of Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs. It is as we read, Prov. 14. 12. <hi>A way that ſeems right to a man, but the end the way of death.</hi> Poor Sinner; Thou art a <hi>Self-deceiver!</hi> The man <hi>dreams,</hi> that he is in the <hi>way to the City of God;</hi> and that a Merciful God, will eaſily forgive all the <hi>Falſe ſteps</hi> he has taken in his way, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bare ſaying, <hi>Lord, Have Mercy upon</hi> me!

            </p>
            <p>Fifthly. There is this to be <hi>Marked</hi> in the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002451_0013_0FDB54DB9F632030"/>
               <hi>way that wicked men have trodden;</hi> The Way grows more <hi>Dirty;</hi> Men grow <hi>worſe &amp; worſe,</hi> the longer they go on in the <hi>way.</hi> We read, 2 Tim 3. 13. <hi>Wicked men will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Seventhly.

compelled to Complain unto their Father of them. The Wretches are now probably near the <hi>End</hi> of their Way. There is a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Symptom of wicked and wretched Ones, haſtening to their End; in Prov 29. 1. <hi>He that being often Reproved, hardeneth his Neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed and without Remedy.</hi> Oh! That ſome <hi>Ungodly</hi> Ones would lay to Heart, theſe Thunders of God!</p>
            <p>Eighthly. In the <hi>Way that wicked men have trodden,</hi> there is this Thing that calls for a <hi>Mark</hi> upon it, God by <hi>Wonderful Ways</hi> does bring out, the moſt <hi>Secret Wickedneſs</hi> in their Way. In the <hi>Way of wicked men,</hi> there are many things done, for which they flatter themſelves with an Eternal <hi>Secrecy;</hi> for, as we read, Eph. 5 17. <hi>They are things that are done of them in Secret</hi> But the Crimes of wicked Ones are not Concealed from God; <hi>Can any hide himſelf in Secret Places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Let never ſuch <hi>Arts of Concealment</hi> be uſed for the <hi>Covering</hi> of their Crimes, <hi>I, even I, Know them; and am a Witneſs of them, ſaith the Lord</hi> And the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God has aſtoniſhing Ways to bring out the <hi>Secret Wickedneſs</hi> in which wicked Men do indulge themſelves. God fulfils that word upon them, Numb 32. 33. <hi>Be ſure your Sin ſhall find you out.</hi> He makes the <hi>Accomplices</hi> of Wicked ones, to bring out one another.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002451_0018_0FDB54EC6901D938"/>
God leaves Wicked Ones to <hi>freſh Villanies,</hi> which bring out all their <hi>former</hi> ones.

            <p>Ninthly. In the <hi>Way that wicked men have trodden,</hi> there is vet One thing more to be <hi>Marked;</hi> That is, The <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Way.</hi> Tis a <hi>Way</hi> that will be terribly Puniſhed in the <hi>End;</hi> It will be <hi>Bitterneſs in the Latter End.</hi> We are called upon, Pſal. 37. 37. <hi>Mark the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, and behold the upright, for the End of that man is peace.</hi> But we are now to be thus called upon. <hi>Mark</hi> the <hi>Wicked man, &amp; behold the Evil one, &amp; his Evil Way; for the End of his Way, is to ly down in deſperate &amp; eternal Sorrow.</hi> Sinners, You are warned of God; Prov 13 21 <hi>Evil purſueth Sinners.</hi> The <hi>Warning</hi> that God has given you, is, <hi>The wicked ſhall not go Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</hi> Nay, <hi>There is a ſtrange Puniſhment

I muſt thank my ſelf for it, that I am brought to this untimely diſmal End.
