            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>WE are ſo formed by the God of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doubtleſs for wiſe and good ends, that the uneaſy ſenſation to which we give the name of <hi>thirſt,</hi> is an inſeperable attendant on the want of ſome proper liquid. And as this want is increaſed, ſuch proportionably will be the increaſe of uneaſineſs; and the uneaſineſs may gradually heighten, till it throws one into a ſtate that is truly tormenting. The application of cooling
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010255_0004_0F7E248F45D9B610"/>
drink is fitted, by an eſtabliſhed law of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not only to remove away this uneaſineſs, but to give pleaſure in the doing of it, by its manner of acting upon the organs of taſte. There is ſcarce a keener perception of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than that which is felt by one that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt upon being ſatisfied with agreable drink. Hence the deſire of ſpiritual good things, in thoſe who have had excited in them a ſerious ſenſe of God and religion, is repreſented, in the ſacred books, by the "cravings of a thirſty man after drink." Hence the devout David, when he would expreſs the longing of his ſoul to "appear before God in his ſanctuary," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles it to the "panting of an hart after the water-brooks." In like manner, "cold water to a thirſty ſoul" is the image under which the wiſe man would ſignifie, in my text, the gratefulneſs of "good news." Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing to the ſoul, as cold waters to the tongue when parched with thirſt: Eſpecially is good news adapted to affect the heart with pleaſure, when it comes "from a far country," and is big with important bleſſings, not to a few individuals only, but to communities, and numbers of them ſcattered over a largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended continent.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the "good news" lately brought us from the other ſide the great waters. No news
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010255_0005_0F7E248FD7FA7168"/>
handed to us from Great-Britain, ever gave us a quicker ſenſe, or higher degree, of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. It rapidly ſpread through the Colonies, and, as it paſſed along, opened in all hearts the ſprings of joy. The emotion of a ſoul juſt famiſhed with thirſt, upon taking down a full draught of cold water, is but a faint emblem of the ſuperior gladneſs with which we were univerſally filled upon this great occaſion. That was the language of our mouths, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleaſurable ſtate of our minds, "as cold waters to a thirſty ſoul; ſo is this good news from a far country."</p>
            <p>WHAT I have in view is, to take occaſion from theſe words to call your attention to ſome of the important articles contained in the good news we have heard, which ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fit it to excite a pungent ſenſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the breaſts of all that inhabit theſe American lands. The way will then be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to point out to you the wiſeſt and beſt uſe we can make of theſe glad-tidings "from a far country."</p>
            <p>THE firſt article in this "good news," ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly preſenting itſelf to conſideration, is the kind and righteous regard the ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in England, to which we inviolably owe ſubmiſſion, has paid to the "commercial good"
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010255_0006_0F7E24909C8623A8"/>
of the Nation at home, and its dependant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Iſlands. One of the expreſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned reaſons for the REPEAL of the Stamp-Act, is declared in theſe words, "Whereas the continuance of ſaid act—may be product<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive of conſequences greatly detrimental to the commercial intereſts of theſe Kingdoms, may it therefore pleaſe"—. The Engliſh Colonies and Iſlands are certainly included in the words, "theſe Kingdoms;" for they are as truly parts of them as either Scotland, Ireland, or even Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land itſelf. It was therefore with a profeſſed view to the commercial good, not only of the Nation at home, but of the Plantations alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that the authority of the Britiſh King and Parliament interpoſed to render null and void that act, which, had it been continued in force, might, in its conſequences, have tended to the hurt of this grand intereſt, inſeperably connected with the welfare of both. From what more noble ſource could a REPEAL of this act have proceded? Not merely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, but that benevolent righteous regard to the public good which gave it birth, is an important ingredient in the news that has made us glad. And wherein could this "good news" have been better adapted to ſoften our hearts, ſooth our paſſions, and excite in us the ſenſations of unmingled joy? What that is conducive to our real happineſs, may we not
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010255_0007_0F7E249156219E70"/>
expect from a King and Parliament, whoſe regard to "the commercial intereſt" of the Britiſh Kingdoms has overpowered all oppoſition from reſentment, the diſplay of ſovereign pleaſure, or whatever other cauſe, and influenced them to give up, even a CROWN-REVENUE for the ſake of a greater national good? With what confidence may we rely upon ſuch a ſupreme legiſlature for the redreſs of all grievances, eſpecially in the article of trade, and the deviſing every wiſe and fit method to put and keep it in a flouriſhing ſtate? Should any thing, in time to come, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily be brought into event, detrimental in its operation to the commerce between the Mother-country, and theſe Colonies, through miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations from "lovers of themſelves more than lovers" of their King and Country, may we not encourage ourſelves to hope, that the like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous public ſpirit that has relieved us now, will again interpoſe itſelf on our behalf? Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are we in being under the government of a King and Parliament, who can REPEAL, as well as enact a law, upon a view of it as tending to the public happineſs! How preferable is our condition to their's, who have nothing to expect but from the arbitrary will of thoſe, to whom they are ſlaves, rather than ſubjects?</p>
            <p>ANOTHER thing, giving us ſingular pleaſure, contained in this "good news" is, the total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010255_0008_0F7E249213081200"/>
of a grievous burden we muſt have ſunk under, had it been continued. Had the real ſtate of the Colonies been as well known at home as it is here, it is not eaſily ſuppoſeable, any there would have thought the tax, impoſed on us by the STAMP-ACT, was ſutably adjuſted to our circumſtances and abilities. There is ſcarce a man in any of the Colonies, certainly there is not in the New-England ones, that would be deemed worthy of the name of a rich man in Great-Britain. There may be here and there a rare inſtance of one that may have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty thouſand pounds ſterling; and this is the moſt that can be made of what they may be thought worth: But for the reſt, they are, generally ſpeaking, in a low condition, or, at beſt, not greatly riſing above it; though in different degrees, variouſly placing them in the enjoyment of the neceſſaries and comforts of life. And ſuch it might naturally be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would be the true ſtate of the Coloniſts; as the lands they poſſeſs in this NEW COUNTRY could not have been ſubdued and fitted for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable uſe, but by labor too expenſive to allow of their being, at preſent, much increaſed in wealth. This labor indeed may properly be conſidered as a natural tax, which, though it has made way for an aſtoniſhing increaſe of ſubjects to the Britiſh Empire, greatly adding to its dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010255_0009_0F7E249311B38650"/>
and ſtrength, has yet been the occaſion of keeping us poor and low.—It ought alſo to be remembered, the occaſions, in a NEW COUNTRY, for the grant or purchaſe of property, with the obligations ariſing therefrom, and in inſtances of comparatively ſmall value, are unavoidably more numerous than in thoſe that have been long ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. The occaſions alſo for recourſe to the law are, in like manner, vaſtly multiplied: For which reaſon, the ſame tax by <hi>ſtamped-paper</hi> would take vaſtly more in proportion from the people here, than in England. And what would have rendered this duty the more hard and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere is, that it muſt have been paid in addition to the Government-tax here, which was, I have good reaſon to think, more heavy on us in the late war, and is ſo ſtill on account of the great debt then contracted, at leaſt in this province, in proportion to our numbers and abilities, than that which, in every way, was laid on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple either of Scotland, Ireland, or England.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>I have been aſſured by a Gentleman of reputation and fortune, in this Town, that, in the late time of war, he ſent one of his rate-bills to a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of note in London, for his judgment upon it; and had this anſwer in return from his friend, "that he did not believe there was a man in all England, who paid ſo much, in proportion, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſupport of the Government." It will render the above account the more eaſily credible, if I inform the reader, that I have lately and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely converſed with one of the ASSESSORS of this Town, who has been annually choſen by them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this office for a great number of years, for which reaſon he may be thought a perſon of integrity, and one that may be depended on; and he declares to me, that the aſſeſſment upon this Town, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in one of the years when the tax on account of the war was great, was as follows: On <hi>perſonal</hi> eſtate, thirteen ſhillings and four pence on the pound, that is to ſay, if a man's income from money at intereſt, or in any other way, was ſixty pounds per annum, he was aſſeſſed ſixty times thirteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and four pence, and in this proportion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſum was more or leſs: On <hi>real</hi> eſtate, the aſſeſſment was at the rate of ſix years income, that is to ſay, if a man's houſe or land was valued at two hundred pounds per annum income, this two hundred pounds was multiplied by ſix, amounting to twelve hundred pounds, and the intereſt of this twelve hundred pounds, that is, ſeventy two pounds was the ſum he was obliged to pay. Beſides this, the rate upon every man's pole, and the poles of all the males in his houſe upwards of ſixteen years of age, was about nineteen ſhillings lawful money, which is only one quarter part ſhort of ſterling. Over and above all this, they paid their part of an exciſe that was laid upon Tea, Coffee, Rum and Wine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to a very conſiderable ſum.</p>
                  <p>How it was in the other Provinces, or in the other Towns of this, I know not; but it may be relied on as fact, that this was the tax levied upon the Town of Boſton. And it has been great ever ſince, tho' not ſo enormouſly ſo as at that time. Every one may now judge, whether we had not abundant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for mournful complaint, when, in addition to the vaſt ſums (conſidering our numbers and abilities) we were obliged to pay, we were loaded with the STAMP-DUTY; which would, in a few years, have taken away all our money, and rendered us abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incapable, either of ſupporting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, or of carrying on any ſort of commerce, unleſs by an exchange of commodities</p>
               </note>

This if mentioned curſorily, was never, that I remember enlarged upon, and ſet in a ſtriking light, in any of the papers wrote in the late times, as it might eaſily have been done, and to good purpoſe—Beſides all which, 'tis undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly true, that the circulating money in all the Colonies would not have been ſufficient to have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010255_0011_0F7E249813F010A0"/>
paid the Stamp-duty only for two years; and an effectual bar was put in the way of the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of more, by the reſtraints that were laid upon our trade in thoſe inſtances wherein it might, in ſome meaſure, have been procured.</p>
            <p>IT was this grievance that occaſioned the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter complaint all over theſe lands, "we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied ſtraw, and yet the full tale of bricks is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us!" Or, as it was otherwiſe uttered, We muſt ſoon be obliged "to borrow money for the King's tribute, and that upon our lands. Yet now our fleſh is as the fleſh of our brethren, our children as their children: And lo! We muſt bring into bondage our ſons and our daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be ſervants." We ſhould have been ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, had not a ſpirit been excited in us to apply, in all reaſonable ways, for the removal of ſo inſupportable a burden. And ſuch an union in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010255_0012_0F7E2498EE1E9C30"/>
ſpirit was never before ſeen in the Colonies: Nor was there ever ſuch univerſal joy as upon the news of our deliverance from that which might have proved a yoke, the moſt grievous that was ever laid upon our necks. It affected in all hearts the lively perceptions of pleaſure, filling our mouths with laughter. No man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared without a ſmile in his countenance. No one met his friend, but he bid him joy. That was our united ſong of praiſe, "Thou haſt turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us our mourning into dancing; thou haſt put off our ſackcloth, and girded us with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—Our glory [our tongue] ſhall ſing praiſe to thee, and not be ſilent: O Lord our God! we will give thanks to thee forever."</p>
            <p>ANOTHER thing, in this "news," making it "good," is the hopeful proſpect it gives us of being continued in the enjoyment of certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and privileges, valued by us next to life itſelf. Such are thoſe of being "tried by our equals," and of "making grants for the ſupport of government of that which is our own, either in perſon, or by repreſentatives we have choſen for the purpoſe." Whether the Coloniſts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a RIGHT to theſe liberties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges that ought not be wreſted from them, or whether they were not, tis the truth of fact, that they really thought they were: All of them as natural heirs to it, by being born ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010255_0013_0F7E2499AC4DF6F8"/>
to the Britiſh Crown; and ſome of them, by additional charter-grants, the legality of which, inſtead of being conteſted, have all along, from the days of our fathers, been aſſented to, and allowed of, by the ſupreme authority at home. And they imagined, whether juſtly, or not. I diſpute not, that their RIGHT to the free and full enjoyment of theſe privileges was their righteous due in conſequence of what they, and their fore-fathers, had done and ſuffered in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing and defending theſe American lands, not only for their own ſupport, but to add extent, ſtrength and glory to the Britiſh-Crown. And as it had been early and deeply impreſſed on their minds, that their Charter-privileges were RIGHTS that had been dearly paid for by a vaſt expence of blood, treaſure and labor, without which this continent muſt have ſtill remained in a wilderneſs-ſtate, and the property of ſavages only; it could not but ſtrongly put in motion their paſſion of grief, when they were laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Parliamentary reſtraint as to the exerciſe of that liberty, they eſteemed their greateſt glory. It was eminently this that filled their minds with jealouſie, and at length a ſettled fear, leſt they ſhould gradually be brought into a ſtate of the moſt abject ſlavery. This it was that gave riſe to the cry, which became general thoughout the Colonies, "we ſhall be made to ſerve as bond-ſervants.—Our lives will be bitter with hard
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010255_0014_0F7E249A61C366F0"/>
bondage." Nor were the Jews more pleaſed with the royal proviſion in their day, which, under God, delivered them from their bondage in Egypt, than were the Coloniſts with the REPEAL of that act which had ſo greatly alarmed their fears, and troubled their hearts. It was to them as "life from the dead." They "rejoiced and were glad." And it gave ſtrength and vigor to their joy, while they looked upon this REPEAL, not merely as taking off the grievous reſtraint that had been laid upon their liberties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, but as containing in it an intention of continued indulgence in the free exerciſe of them. Tis in this view of it, that they exult as thoſe who are "glad in heart;" eſteeming themſelves happy beyond almoſt any people now living on the face of the earth. May they ever be this happy people! And ever have "God for their Lord!"</p>
            <p>THIS news is yet further welcome to us, as it has made way for the return of our love, in all its genuine exerciſes, towards thoſe on the other ſide of the atlantic, who, in common with ourſelves, profeſs ſubjection to the ſame moſt gracious Sovereign. The affectionate regard of the American inhabitants for their Mother Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was never exceeded by any Coloniſts, in any part, or age of the world. We eſteemed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves parts of one whole, members of the ſame
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010255_0015_0F7E249B146BF760"/>
collective body. What affected the people of England, affected us. We partook of their joys and ſorrows; "rejoicing when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced, and weeping when they wept." Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things in the conduct of providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them alarmed our fears, and gave us pain; while proſperous events dilated our hearts, and in proportion to their number and greatneſs. This tender ſympathy with our brethren at home, it is acknowledged, began to languiſh from the commencement of a late Parliamentary act. There aroſe hereupon a general ſuſpicion, whether they eſteemed us brethren, and treated us with that kindneſs we might juſtly expect from them. This jealouſie, working in our breaſts, cooled the fervor of our love; and had that act been continued in force, it might have gradually brought on an alienation of heart, that would have been greatly detrimental to them, as it would alſo have been to ourſelves.—But the REPEAL, of which we have had authentic accounts, has opened the channels for a full flow of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer affection towards our brethren in Great-Britain. Unhappy jealouſies, uncomfortable ſurmiſings and heart-burnings are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and we perceive the motion of an affection for the Country from whence our fore-fathers came, which would influence us
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010255_0016_0F7E249D0F2580A0"/>
to the moſt vigorous exertions, as we might be called, to promote their welfare, looking upon it, in a ſenſe, our own. We again feel with them, and for them; and are happy or unhappy, as they are either in proſperous or adverſe circumſtances. We can, and do, with all ſincerity, "pray for the peace of Great-Britain, and that they may proſper that love her," adopting thoſe words of the devout Pſalmiſt, "Peace be within thy walls, and proſperity within thy palaces. For our brethren's ſake we will ſay, peace be within thee."</p>
            <p>IN fine, this news is refreſhing to us "as cold waters to a thirſty ſoul," as it has effected an alteration in the ſtate of things among us unſpeakably to our advantage. There is no way in which we can ſo ſtrikingly be made ſenſible of this, as by contraſting the ſtate we were lately in, and the much worſe one we ſhould ſoon have been in had the Stamp-Act been enforced, with that happy one we are put into by its repeal.</p>
            <p>UPON its being made certain to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that the Stamp-Act had paſſed both houſes of Parliament, and received the King's fiat, a general ſpirit of uneaſineſs at once took place, which, gradually increaſing, ſoon diſcovered
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010255_0017_0F7E249DA1C3AD40"/>
itſelf, by the wiſer ſons of liberty, in laudable endeavors to obtain relief; though, by others, in murmurings and complaints, in anger and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, in bitterneſs, wrath and ſtrife; and by ſome evil-minded perſons, taking occaſion herefor from the general ferment of men's minds, in thoſe violent out-rages upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of others, which, by being repreſented in an undue light, may have reflected diſhonor upon a country which has an abhorrence of ſuch injurious conduct. The Colonieſ were never before in a ſtate of ſuch diſcontent, anxiety and perplexing ſollicitude: Some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of a redreſs, ſome hoping for it, and all fearing what would be the event. And had it been the determination of the King and Parliament to have carried the STAMP-ACT into effect by ſhips of war, and an embarkati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of troops, their condition, however unhappy before, would have been inconceivably more ſo. They muſt either have ſubmited to what they thought an inſupportable burden, and have parted with their property without any will of their own, or have ſtood upon their defence; in either of which caſes, their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt have been deplorably ſad. So far as I am able to judge from that firmneſs of mind and reſolution of ſpirit, which appeared among all ſorts of perſons, as grounded upon
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010255_0018_0F7E249E1B57F060"/>
this principle deeply rooted in their minds, that they had a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT<note n="*" place="bottom">The Coloniſts may reaſonably be excuſed for their miſtake (if it was one) in thinking, that they were veſted with this CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT, as it was the opinion of Lord CAMDEN, declared in the houſe of Lords, and of Mr. PITT, ſignified in the houſe of Commons, that the STAMP-ACT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. This is ſaid upon the authority of the public prints.</note> to grant their own monies, and to be tried by their peers, tis more probable, they would not have ſubmited, unleſs they had been obliged to it by ſuperior power. Not that they had a thought in their hearts, as may have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, of being an independant people. They eſteemed it both their happineſs and their glory to be, in common with the inhabitants of England, Scotland and Ireland, the ſubjects of King GEORGE the third, whom they heartily love and honor, and in defence of whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Crown they would chearfully expend their treaſure, and loſe even their blood. But it was a ſentiment they had imbibed, that they ſhould be wanting neither in loyalty to their King, or a due regard to the Britiſh-Parliament, if they ſhould defend thoſe rights which they imagined were unalienable, upon
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010255_0019_0F7E249ED47DB658"/>
the foot of juſtice, by any power on earth.<note n="*" place="bottom">The great Mr. PITT would not have ſaid, in a certain auguſt Aſſembly, ſpeaking of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, "I rejoice that they have reſiſted," if, in his judgment, they might not, in conſiſtency with their duty to government, have made a ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the STAMP-ACT. Tis certainly true, there may be ſuch exerciſe of power, and in inſtances of ſuch a nature, as to render non-ſubmiſſion war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable upon the foot of reaſon and righteouſneſs: Otherwiſe it will be difficult, if poſſible, to juſtifie the REVOLUTION, and that ESTABLISHMENT in conſequence of it, upon which his preſent Majeſty ſits upon the Britiſh throne. That non-ſubmiſſion would have been juſtifiable, had it been determined that the STAMP-ACT ſhould be enforced, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not to ſay: Though none, I believe, who are the friends of liberty, will deny, that it would have been juſtifiable, ſhould it be firſt ſuppoſed, that THIS ACT eſſentially broke in upon our CONSTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTIONAL RIGHTS as Engliſhmen. Whether it did, or not, is a queſtion it would be impertinent in me to meddle with. It is the truth of fact, that the Coloniſts generally and really thought it did; and that it might be oppoſed without their incurring the guilt of diſloyalty or rebellion; and they were led into this way of thinking upon what they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined were the principles which, in their operation, gave KING WILLIAM, and QUEEN MARY, of bleſſed memory, the Crown of England.</note> And had they, upon this principle, whether ill or well founded, ſtood upon their defence, what muſt have been the effect? There would have been opened, on this American continent, a moſt doleful ſcene of outrage, violence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, ſlaughter, and, in a word, all thoſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010255_0020_0F7E24A157B3BBD8"/>
terrible evils that may be expected as the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants on a ſtate of civil war. No language can deſcribe the diſtreſſes, in all their various kinds and degrees, which would have made us miſerable. God only knows how long they might have continued, and whether they would have ended in any thing ſhort of our total ruin. Nor would the Mother-Country, whatever ſome might imagine, have been untouched with what was doing in the Colonies. Thoſe millions that were due from this continent to Great-Britain, could not have been paid;—a ſtop, a total ſtop, would have been put to the importation of thoſe manufactures which are the ſupport of thouſands at home, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. And would the Britiſh merchants, and manufacturers, have ſet eaſie in ſuch a ſtate of things? There would, it may be, have been as much clamour, wrath and ſtrife in the very bowels of the nation, as in theſe diſtant lands: Nor could our deſtruction have been unconnected with conſequences at home infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to be dreaded.—.</p>
            <p>But the longed for REPEAL has ſcattered our fears, removed our difficulties, enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our hearts, and laid the foundation for future proſperity, equal to the adverſe ſtate we ſhould have been in, had the Act been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and enforced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:010255_0021_0F7E24A219657ED0"/>
WE may now be eaſie in our minds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with our condition. We may be at peace and quiet among ourſelves, every one minding his own buſineſs. All ground of complaint, that we are "ſold for bond-men and bond-women," is removed away; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being ſlaves to thoſe who treat us with rigor, we are indulged the full exerciſe of thoſe liberties which have been tranſmitted to us, as the richeſt inheritance, from our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. We have now greater reaſon than ever to love, honor and obey our gracious King, and pay all becoming reverence and reſpect to his two houſes of Parliament; and may with intire confidence, rely on their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, lenity, kindneſs, and power, to promote our welfare. We have now, in a word, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to "make us afraid," but may "ſit every man under his vine, and under his fig-tree," in the full enjoyment of the many good things we are favored with in the providence of God.</p>
            <p>UPON ſuch a change in the ſtate of our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, we ſhould be loſt to all ſenſe of duty and gratitude, and act as though we had no underſtanding, if our hearts did not expand with joy. And, in truth, the danger is, leſt we ſhould exceed in the expreſſions of it. It may be ſaid of theſe Colonies, as of the Jewiſh people, upon the repeal of the decree of Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010255_0022_0F7E24A292A6B820"/>
which devoted them to deſtruction, they "had light and gladneſs, joy and honor; and in every province, and in every city, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever the King's commandment and his decree came, they had joy and gladneſs, a feaſt day, and a good day;" ſaying within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, "the Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad." May the remembrance of this MEMORABLE REPEAL be preſerved, and handed down to all future generations, in every province, in every city, and in every family, ſo as never to be forgotten!</p>
            <p>WE now proceed, the way being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, to point out the proper uſe we ſhould make of this "good news from a far country," which is grateful to us "as cold waters to a thirſty ſoul."</p>
            <p>WE have already had our rejoicings, in the civil ſenſe, upon the "glad-tidings" from our Mother-Country; and tis to our honor, that they were carried on ſo univerſally within the bounds of a decent warrantable regularity. There was never, among us, ſuch a collection of all ſorts of people upon any public occaſion: Nor were the methods in which they ſignified their joy ever ſo beautifully varied and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and yet, none had reaſon to complain
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010255_0023_0F7E24A35758F590"/>
of diſorderly conduct. The ſhow was ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ended, and we had afterwards a perfectly quiet night. There has indeed been no public diſturbance ſince the outrage at Lieut. Governor HUTCHINSON'S houſe. That was ſo deteſted by Town and Country, and ſuch a ſpirit at once ſo generally ſtirred up, particularly among THE PEOPLE, to oppoſe ſuch villainous conduct, as has preſerved us ever ſince in a ſtate of as great freedom from mobiſh actions, as has been known in the Country. Our friends at home, it ſhould ſeem, have entertained fears, leſt, upon the lenity and condeſcention of the King and Parliament, we ſhould prove ourſelves a factious turbulent people; and our enemies hope we ſhall. But tis not eaſie to conceive on what the fears of the one, or the hopes of the other, ſhould be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs they have received injurious repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the ſpirit that lately prevailed in this, as well as the other Colonies; which was not a ſpirit to raiſe needleſs diſturbances, or to commit outrages upon the perſons or property of any; though ſome of thoſe ſons of wickedneſs, which are to be found in all places,<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been ſaid, and in the public prints, that there have been mobiſh riotous doings in London, and other parts of England, at one time and another; and that great men, at ſuch times, men far ſuperior to any among us in dignity and power, ſuffered in their <hi>perſons,</hi> by inſulting threatning words and actions; and in their <hi>property.</hi> by the injurious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence that deſtroyed their ſubſtance. Would it be juſt to characteriſe London, much more England it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from the conduct of theſe diſturbers of it's peace? it would as reaſonably, as certainly, be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a vile reproach, ſhould they, on this account, be repreſented as, in general, a turbulent ſeditious people, diſpoſed to throw off their ſubjection to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and bring things into a ſtate of anarchy and confuſion. If this has been the repreſentation that has been made of the Coloniſts, on account of what any may have ſuffered in their perſons, or effects, by the ungoverned diſorderly behavior of ſome mobiſhly diſpoſed perſons, it is really nothing better than a baſe ſlander; and no more applicable to them, than to the people of England. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts in general, the inhabitants of this Province in particular, are as great enemies to all irregular turbulent procedings, and as good friends to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and as peaceable loyal Subjects, as any that call King GEORGE the IIId, their rightful and lawful Sovereign.</note> might take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010255_0024_0F7E24A416A65318"/>
from the ſtand that was made for liberty to commit violence with an high hand. There has not been, ſince the REPEAL the appearance of a ſpirit tending to public diſorder; nor is there any danger ſuch a ſpirit ſhould be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, or diſcovered, unleſs the people ſhould be needleſly and unreaſonably irritated by thoſe, who, to ſerve themſelves, might be willing we ſhould gratifie ſuch as are our enemies, and make thoſe ſo who have been our good friends.—But to leave this digreſſion,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:010255_0025_0F7E24A4D24B9418"/>
THOUGH our civil joy has been expreſſed in a decent orderly way, it would be but a poor piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, ſhould we reſt here, and not make our religious grateful acknowledgments to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ruler of the world, to whoſe ſuper intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providence it is principally to be aſcribed, that we have had "given us ſo great deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance." Whatever were the means or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in order to this, that glorious being, whoſe throne is in the heavens, and whoſe kingdom ruleth over all, had the chief hand herein. He ſat at the helm, and ſo governed all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to it, as to bring it to this happy iſſue. It was under his alwiſe over-ruling influence, that a SPIRIT was raiſed in all the Colonies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to aſſert their freedom as men, and Engliſh-born ſubjects; a ſpirit, which, in the courſe of it's operation, was highly ſerviceable, not by any irregularities it might be the occaſion of, [in this imperfect ſtate, they will more or leſs mix themſelves with every thing great and good] but by it's manly efforts, ſetting forth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they had for complaint in a fair, juſt, and ſtrongly convincing light; hereby awakening the attention of Great-Britain, opening the eyes of the merchants and manufacturers there, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them, for their own intereſt as well as that of America to exert themſelves in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ways to help us: It was under the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010255_0026_0F7E24A7AEF57FE8"/>
ſame all governing influence, that the late mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, full of projections tending to the hurt of theſe Colonies, was ſo ſeaſonably changed into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent patriotic one, which is happily diſpoſed, in all the methods of wiſdom, to promote our welfare:</p>
            <p>It was under the ſame influence ſtill, that ſo many friends of eminent character were raiſed up, and ſpirited to appear advocates on our behalf, and plead our cauſe with irreſiſtable force: It was under this ſame influence alſo, that the heart of our King, and the Britiſh Parliament, were ſo turned in favor to us as to reverſe that decree, which, had it been eſtabliſhed, would have thrown this whole continent, if not the nation itſelf, into a ſtate of the utmoſt confuſion: In ſhort, it was ultimately owing to this influence of the God of heaven, that the thoughts, the views, the purpoſes, the ſpeeches, the writings, and the whole conduct of all who were engaged in this great affair, were ſo over-ruled to bring into effect the deſired happy event.</p>
            <p>AND ſhall we not make all due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the great Sovereign of the world on this joyful occaſion? Let us, my brethren, take care that our hearts be ſutably touched with a ſenſe of the bonds we are under to the Lord of the univerſe; and let us expreſs the joy and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our hearts by greatly praiſing him for the greatneſs of his goodneſs, in thus ſcattering our
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010255_0027_0F7E24A827A82920"/>
fears, removing away our burdens, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in the enjoyment of our moſt highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued liberties and privileges. And let us not only praiſe him with our lips, rendering thanks to his holy name; but let us honor him by a well ordered converſation. "Behold, to obey is better than ſacrifice." And "to love the Lord our God with all our heart, and mind and ſtrength, and to love our neighbour as ourſelves, is better than whole burnt-offerings and ſacrifices." Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſpeak much louder than words. In vain ſhall we pretend, that we are joyful in God, or thankful to him, if it is not our endeavor, as we have been taught by the grace of God, which has appeared to us by Jeſus Chriſt, to "deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in the world." doing all things whatſoever it has pleaſed God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us.</p>
            <p>AND as he has particularly enjoined it on us to be "ſubject to the higher powers, ordained by him to be his miniſters for good," we cannot, upon this occaſion, more properly expreſs our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to him, than by approving ourſelves duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and loyal to the gracious King, whom he has placed over us. Not that we can be juſtly tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the want of love or ſubjection to the Britiſh Throne. We may have been abuſed by
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010255_0028_0F7E24A8E6707FF8"/>
falſe and injurious repreſentations upon this head: But King GEORGE the IIId has no ſubjects, not within the realm of England itſelf, that are more ſtrongly attached to his perſon and family, that bear a more ſincere and ardent affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, or that would exert themſelves with more life and ſpirit in defence of his crown and dignity.—But it may notwithſtanding. at this time, be ſeaſonable to ſtir up your minds, by putting you in remembrance of your duty to "pray for Kings, and all that are in ſubordinate authority under them," and to "honor and obey them in the Lord." And, if we ſhould take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from the great lenity and condeſcending goodneſs of thoſe, who are ſupreme in authority over us not to "deſpiſe government." not to "ſpeak evil of dignities," not to go into any method of unſeemly diſorderly conduct; but to "lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty," every man moving in his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſphere, and taking due care to "render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Caeſar the things that are Caeſar and to God the things that are God's;"—we ſhould honor our ſelves, anſwer the expectations of thoſe who have dealt thus favorably with us; and, what is more, we ſhould expreſs a becoming regard to the governing-pleaſure of almighty God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:010255_0029_0F7E24A955E63B50"/>
It would alſo be a ſutable return of gratitude to God, if we entertained in our minds, and were ready to expreſs in all proper ways, a juſt ſenſe of the obligations we are under to thoſe Patrons of liberty and righteouſneſs, who were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments employed by him and whoſe wiſe and powerful endeavors, under his bleſſing, were effectual to promote at once the intereſt of the nation at home, and of theſe diſtant Colonies. Their names will, I hope, be ever dear to us, and handed down as ſuch to the lateſt poſterity. That illuſtrious name, in ſpecial, PITT, will, I truſt, be never mentioned but with honor, as the SAVIOR, under God, and the two Kings who made him their prime miniſter, both of the nation and theſe Colonies, not only from the power of France, but, from that which is much worſe, a ſtate of ſlavery under the appellation of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. May his memory be bleſſed! May his great ſervices for his King, the nation, and theſe Colonies, be had in everlaſting remembrance!</p>
            <p>To conclude, Let us be ambitious to make it evident, by the manner of our conduct, that we are good ſubjects and good chriſtians: So ſhall we, in the beſt way, expreſs the grateful ſenſe we have of our obligations to that glorious being, to the wiſdom and goodneſs of whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency over all human affairs it is principally
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010255_0030_0F7E24AA1A8F6C58"/>
owing, that the great object of our fear, and anxious concern, has been ſo happily removed. And may it ever be our care, to behave towards him, ſo as that he may appear on our behalf in every time of danger and difficulty, guard us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt evil, and continue to us all our enjoyments both civil and religious! And may they be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited from us to our children, and to children's children, as long as the ſun and the moon ſhall endure.</p>
