            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Upon this conceipt they paſſed the night in great fear, and watched very carefully for the day.

He was of ill manners, and ſuch a friend to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian. Non-Reſidency, as not to be aſham'd to hold a Benefice in <hi>France</hi> at the ſame time that he was ſuch a ſtickler at <hi>Braſil.</hi> He moved that Sacerdotal Garments might be provided, the Veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, Bread unleavened, and the Wine mingled with Water, and the like. <hi>Richers</hi> in his Sermon, inveighed againſt theſe humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and thoſe that ſought to introduce them; at which <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagnon</hi> was very angry, and ſilencd him: and, as is believed, being advis'd by a Letter from the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> evil intreated the <hi>Geneva</hi> Miniſters, and wearied them out, and their Company; who with much ado, through innumerable dangers, and almoſt ſtarvd, at laſt got to <hi>France.</hi> They were about 18, or 20. Leagues at Sea, when they ſprung a Leak; and the moſt part of their Bread was damnified with the ſalt water: and they could hardly free the Ship by pumping. Whereupon, leſt they ſhould want proviſions for ſo long a Voyage, the Captain gave way to the deſire of five of the Paſſengers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn aſhoar in the Boat: which their Company regretted, for fear <hi>Villagagnon</hi> ſhould do them a diſpleaſure. But they reckoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe, having not given him cauſe of Offence; but Obligation. And ſo with much grief on both ſides they took Leave; commending each other to the Keeping of God. Now being unprovided of Maſt, Sail, and all manner of Tackling for the Boat; and of Skill to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it: twas with infinite difficulty and hazard, that they recovered the Land, and afterward, the Iſland and Fortreſs of <hi>Colligny.</hi> They ſpeedily preſented themſelves to <hi>Villagagnon,</hi> and acquainted him with the Danger occaſioning their Return: and prayd his Favour; foraſmuch as they choſe to dwell with their Countrymen; and not with <hi>Portugals,</hi> or <hi>Indians</hi>: and had left their Wives and Children, to ſerve him in this remote Land; which they were ready to do to the uttermoſt of their power, untill they might have opportunity of returning to <hi>France.</hi> The Governour ſpake them fair; praiſed God for their Deliverance: and ſaid, that tho they left him upon diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,

and were now fallen into his power; yet he would leave Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to God, and by no means deny them Entertainment. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he refuſed to let them make the beſt of their boat, to buy Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for recovery of their impaired health. And within a while, was filld with Jealouſies, leſt all they had ſaid was feigned; and that <hi>Corquillerius</hi> called <hi>du Pont, Richer</hi> and Company, with the help of thoſe gon to the River of <hi>Plate,</hi> upon notice given, would in one night ſurpriſe the Fort, and deſtroy him and his. Whether theſe Fears were real or pretended; he came to a reſolution to take them off as <hi>Traitors</hi>: But not finding how to make that Charge probable, he pitchd upon <hi>Religion,</hi> and drew up Articles for them to anſwer, as thinking ſuch Sacrifices would be very pleaſing to the Court. The <hi>French</hi> of the Continent perſwaded them not to give an account of their Faith to this Apoſtat Tyrant: but that they ſhould rather hide themſelves among the <hi>Portugals,</hi> or <hi>Indians.</hi> But they were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that God calld them to bear witneſs for Him, and accordingly, <hi>John Bordel,</hi> who exceeded the reſt in Learning and Grace, as well as in Age, drew up in writing a Confeſſion of Faith, containing an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Articles. This they all read often, and diſtinctly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each Article; and then all ſignd it. It begins thus: <hi>According to the Doctrine of St</hi> Peter <hi>the Apoſtle, in his firſt Epistle; all Chriſtians ought always to be ready to give an account of the Hope that is in them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Concluſion of their Confeſſion is in theſe words, <hi>This is the Anſwer which we have made to the Articles ſent by you, according to the meaſure and portion of Faith which God hath given us. Let Him be pleaſed to cauſe that it may not dye in us; but may produce fruits worthy of his Children.

And preſently commanded his Executioner to put Irons on their Legs; and to every Chain to hang fifty, or ſixty pound weight: and orderd them to be ſhut up in a naſty dark Priſon, and ſet a Guard of armed men upon them. They comforted one another in Prayer &amp; ſinging of Pſalms.

               <hi>Matthew Vermeil</hi> was brought next, being greatly aſtoniſhed at the death of his companion, he pleaded with <hi>V.</hi> for his life with ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations, Have we robbed you, or evilly entreated the leaſt of your ſervants? Have we plotted your death, or done any thing to your diſhonour? No Villain! ſaid he; you and your companions dye for no ſuch things as theſe; but becauſe you are a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Peſt to be ſeparated from the Church, leſt you ſpoil the reſt of my company. The Martyr anſwered, Eight moneths are not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſince you made an ample confeſſion of the Points for which you make us dye this day. Afterward he petitioned him again for his life, offering to become his ſervant. <hi>V.</hi> ſaid he had nothing for him to do: but he would think of it, if he would recant his Error. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meil</hi> ſeeing no hope given him, but what was deſtructive to his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, became thereby reſolv'd in his mind, and Cryed out with a loud Voice, <hi>I had rather dye, to live eternally with the LORD: than to live a little while, and dye for ever with Satan.</hi> After he had made his Prayer upon the Rock, and commended his Soul to the Care of God, he freely delivered himſelf into the hands of the Executioner; and Crying out with a loud Voice, <hi>Lord Jeſus! have mercy on me!</hi> He gave up the ghoſt. <hi>Andrew la Fon</hi> had not ſtrength enough to climb up into this Rock of Martyrdom: but by Promiſes &amp; Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings, was drawn to ſome degree of Recantation: Or elſe was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by <hi>Villagagnon</hi> for the ſake of his Trade of a Tailor, which was very neceſſary.

Whereas God did but privatly, and partially favour the other. And that, many times, Not to ſave them from death (The Witneſſes muſt be ſlain) but to ſtrengthen them, and inable them to dye Triumphing. As it fared with Chriſt their Head. In this Divine Temple, <hi>the Ark of the Covenant is Seen:</hi> There's another difference. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> conjectures it may be meant of Chriſt's Perſonal Appearance. See lib. 5. cap. 11. P. 1114. However, then it will ſatisfactorily and plainly appear to the Saints, that God in Chriſt, is a God Keeping Covenant; a God of Truth, Fullfilling every good Word He hath ſpoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Choſen, and concerning his Enemies. Then, and not till then, will it fully appear, that God is a faithfull Keeper of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant recorded <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.31. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8. The Iſraelites had indeed ſerved <hi>Baal,</hi> and not <hi>Jehovah</hi>: Therefore it was fit that God ſhould carry it towards them as <hi>Baal</hi> did to his prophets, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 18.26. — 29.

            <p>Upon theſe grounds, the forementioned Objection ceaſeth to be cogent with me. And I am ſo far from thinking that no Vial is yet poured forth; that I am apt to conclude, that no leſs than Five ANGELS have already poured out their Vials. So many gueſſes have been made about the Subject of the Fourth Vial; that if I do enter a claim for the Sun of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> I ſhall no more incur the danger of being extravagant, than ſome that have gone before me. Certainly, that is the Sun that conſolidates and cheriſhes the Anti-chriſtian State. As for the Fifth Vial; <hi>Bullinger, Brightman, Forbes, Pareus, Mede,</hi> and Company Interpreters of the <hi>Revelaton,</hi> have poured that to purpoſe. As alſo Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> The Author of the Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent, Chamier, Robert Parker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> cum multis Alijs.

In the mean time, <hi>Berard de Padoa,</hi> who was fled from the Imperial Army, certified the Pope, that the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> the General was dead, and that their Courage was thereby ſo much abated, that they deſired an Accord with him: in which matter they ſent out men to parly with the Principals. On the day following, while the Pope was in this perplexity, not knowing what courſe to take; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing neither Order, nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to defend the Quarter beyond <hi>Tiber,</hi> entered without any Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and the ſame evening, they entered by the bridge <hi>Xiſto,</hi> into the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> where all was turned into Flight, and Confuſion. For want of great Artillery, the firſt Dispute was ſharp; in which there fell of the Imperialiſts One Thouſand. Being exaſperated by this Loſs, and the death of their General; they ſlew and put to the Sword Four Thouſand. In their pillaging, ſmall regard was had to Friends or Favourites; much leſs was reſpected the Authority of Cardinals and Prelates, tho of their own Nation; Or the Dignity of Rich Temples, Relicks, Dedications. It is hard to particulariſe the greatneſs of the Prey. But that which made the Spoil infinite in Value, was the Quality and great number of Priſoners, Redeemed with moſt rich and huge Ranſoms.

The Pope was at laſt ſo far meekened by the complication of many preſſing Calamities attending a ſtrait Siege, as to be brought to a Compoſition with the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts.

But becauſe they would not all at one time, range themſelves under the power of ſo mighty Princes, they declined it. The Pope's chief hope was in <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, who had been Caeſars Priſoner but a little before; and now the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> were in his hand as Hoſtages. Which rendred his motions ſlow and irregular, as of a perſon in Fetters. So that Monſieur <hi>Lawtrech</hi> commander of the Leaguers Army advanced not ſo far as <hi>Rome.</hi> And <hi>Tiber</hi> by its Overflowing, incommoded a Party of their Men.

all expectation, did not only conſtantly remain; but being confident of defending the City, he did not only forbid <hi>Men</hi> to go away; but alſo made an Ordinance that no <hi>Goods</hi> ſhould be carried out; which Merchants and Artificers would have ſecured by ſending them down the River. <hi>Ea Nocte nihil unquam lugubrius aut funeſtius</hi> Roma <hi>vidit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Onuphrius</hi> in the life of <hi>Clement,</hi> p. 382. col 2.

            <p>Upon all, or ſome of theſe Conſiderations, it ſeems to me probable that Five of the Vials are already poured out. Not but that they hold on their courſe ſtill; and will do ſo, untill the Confluence of them all do with irreſiſtible Force ingulf Antichriſtianiſme in utter Ruine. The truth is, all the Vials may in ſome ſence be ſaid to have been poured out together at the beginning of this Period of <hi>Rome</hi>'s gradual Decay. Yet there are critical Times, and characteriſtical paſſages of divine Providence, wherein each Vial obtains the ſucceſſive Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Sixth Angel ſeems now to ſtand ready with his Vial, waiting only for the Word to be given for the pouring of it out The pouring out of this Vial will dry up the Antichriſtian Intereſts in the New World: and thereby prepare the way for the Kings of the Eaſt.

Only as <hi>Euphrates</hi> is one individual River, ſo tis ſuitable to limit it to this Continent; thereby to keep it as it were within its banks. There is an harmony between the Third and Sixth Vials. In the pouring out of that, the Antichriſtian Rivers were made bloody, by the Civil, and Military Sword: By the pouring out of this, the Great River is wholly dryed up; ſo that Nothing of it is left remaining to make <hi>Babylon</hi> glad.

Conſequently, the <hi>Armagedduntine</hi> Expedition will ſome way reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that of 1588. Only it will be much greater, and more fatal to the principal Undertakers. Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> couples <hi>Revelation,</hi> 16.16. with <hi>Daniel,</hi> 11.45. So that if the genuine ſence of that place hath been given, we know where to look for the drying up of <hi>Euphrates.</hi> And to make the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire the ſubject of the Sixth Vial, ſeems heterogeneous: For <hi>Euphrates</hi> muſt needs be parcel of the Waters upon which the Whore ſits at the time when this great River comes to be dried up: Which the Sun of Righteouſneſs will do, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo much of her dominion to ceaſe for ever. The Pope and his followers, by warring againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> do not dry up <hi>Euphrates</hi>: but do inlarge the <hi>Papal,</hi> by the diminution of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. And although the paſſing away of the ſecond Wo be matter of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Joy; yet to make it to be the drying up of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> ſeems hard: For the Sixth Vial doth not carry off an <hi>Old</hi> Plague; but brings on a <hi>New</hi> one. Neither did I ever hear that the Reformed Churches fared ſo much the better for the taking of <hi>Buda,</hi> as to make me think that <hi>Euphrates</hi> was then partly dried up. Moreover this is a new accommodation. The firſt that I find of it, is in Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> p. 373. Probably, if he had met with it before, he would have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiond it; that being his profeſſed deſign, Praefat. p. 6. But he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth Interpreters went another way, and endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them. <hi>Pareus</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>Neque nova vel recens a nobis excogitata est haec interpretatio. Eandem enim ANONYMUS meus ante</hi> 260. <hi>annos expreſſit his verbis, &amp;c. col.</hi> 839. The inconſiſtency of this Opinion with <hi>Mede</hi>'s <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> makes not a little againſt it. He himſelf ſeems to be put upon bending the fourth, to make it conform; <hi>aut ſaltem quod beſtiae ſaluti innexum, ejuſque intereſt. p.</hi> 656. Although ſo great a Pilot's taking this path, was an extraordinary prejudice; yet many learned Expoſitours have ſtill choſen to go in that which was the beaten Road in Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>'s time; and, as I ſuppoſe, was, and is the KING's high Way. Mend but the Chronology of <hi>Alcaſar,</hi>s dream, and what he hath written upon the Sixth Vial, becomes a very good <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Expoſition; <hi>Etenim repente, et praeter opinionem, alius uxorem propriam eſſe Christianam deprehendit, alius filiam, fratres alius, alius cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natos &amp; affines; ac demum omnes pariter animadverterunt Christianam Fidem ſeſe in mediam</hi> Romam, <hi>et in ipſas eorum domos inſinuaſſe, atque adeo vix aliquam eſse ſuper, quo non coeleſtis ille penetraſſet Ignis, quem Chriſtus in terra accenſurus advenit. p.</hi> 730.

The Natives are alſo much addicted to Forts and Caſtles, as they call them; which are ineffectual to preſerve them from Slaughter.

            <p>Theſe are the Sentiments of Mr. <hi>Nicolas Fuller</hi> concerning the New World, and them that dwell therein; both as to what is paſt, and to come.

What matter is it how <hi>America</hi> be called? For <hi>Flavio</hi> of <hi>Malphi</hi> in <hi>Naples</hi> hath, in great meaſure,<note place="margin">1300.</note> applied the Vertues of the Loadſtone to the Mariners Compaſs, <hi>in Vain</hi>; the <hi>Portugals</hi> have found the length of <hi>Africa</hi>'s foot, <hi>in Vain</hi>; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent out the <hi>Italian</hi> Dove, <hi>in Vain</hi>; Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> hath ſailed round the World, and made thorow Lights to it, <hi>in Vain</hi>; and <hi>Hakluyt</hi> and <hi>Purchas</hi> have, with endleſs Labour, acquainted <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> with theſe Things, in Vain: If after all, we go about to turn the <hi>American Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> into a <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake! The breaking of this One Inſtrument, ſpoils us of the long expected, and much deſired Conſort of Muſick.</p>
            <p>Another thing that Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> drives at, is, he would fain have it believ'd, that <hi>America</hi> was firſt peopled by the Poſterity of our Great Grandfather <hi>JAPHETH</hi>; tho he will not be very ſtrict with us, as to the particular branch of that Wide Family; as the Breadth of his <hi>Parentheſis</hi> ſhews.

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000813_0062_0FAA56E9B0467988"/>
of the 2<hi>d</hi> Part contains Motives to Goſpellize the Heathen, ſuch as the <hi>Indians</hi> are. The Firſt Motive is the <hi>Command of GOD,</hi> whoſe we are, and whom we profeſs to ſerve. This <hi>Command</hi> is either plainly expreſſed; or cloſely implyed in the Promiſes. An expreſs Command is to be ſeen in <hi>Mark,</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature. Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>It is neceſſary the Fullneſs of the Gentiles ſhould come in: and doth Faith come upon any by Chance? Why ſhould bounds be ſet to the word of Faith, ſo long as Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remains? With what Confidence, what Conſcience do we not offer Christ to them that have him not? Do we detain the Word of God in Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</hi> Bernard. lib. 3. cap. 1. de Conſid.</p>
            <p>Another Motive offers it ſelf from the <hi>Coming of our dear LORD</hi>; which, if real Chriſtians, we do deſire: but if intelligent ones, will not expect (becauſe we cannot obtain) till the <hi>Indians</hi> be Goſpelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.14. <hi>And this Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be preached in All the World, for a witneſs unto All Nations, and then ſhall the End come.</hi> I need not again reſcue this Text to the ſence that favours the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Goſpelling: but rather imploy it in this Service. Chriſtians, Would you not gladly have Chriſt come? Do you not long for ſuch a Day of his <hi>Preſence,</hi> as will never be obſcured by a Night of <hi>Abſence</hi> or Withdrawing? Do you not look out ſharp for Him, to end the Violences and Abuſes of the ſons of Wickedneſs? To diſpatch this Vain and Vexatious world? What ſay you? Do you ſo love Chriſt, as to ſay with the Bride, by the ſame Spirit, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus! Come quickly!</hi> Are you in good earneſt that hear this? Deſire then, Pray and Labour that the Goſpel may be preached in all the World; in this <hi>Indian</hi> End of it. For till then, Chriſt himſelf tells you, He will not, He cannot come. The Door is, as it were, ſhut againſt Him. How do you deſire Him to come in, and yet ly drowſing and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on your Bed, as a Door upon the hinge? You are trying near hand, how you can ſhift for your <hi>Selves</hi>; and ſo in effect, ſhift off <hi>CHRIST,</hi> who is all this while kept without door. For Love, or Shame, Get Up! and Open the Door! 2 <hi>Peter,</hi> 3.12. <hi>Looking for, and haſting unto the coming of the day of God.</hi> Sit not then ſtill: but as we uſe to do with deſirable and welcom Gueſts, go out to meet Him, and bring Him in. What is done or prepared by Papiſts among <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> is not to be deſpiſed; but improved by Proteſtants.
