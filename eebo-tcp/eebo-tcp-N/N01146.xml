            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOME Eminent Proteſtant Divines, as <hi>Nye,</hi> and <hi>Sherwood,</hi> have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſome Diſlike for <hi>Funeral Sermons;</hi> And thus, the Famous <hi>Cartwright,</hi> ſuppoſing them to come in the room of <hi>Trentals.</hi> In ſome Reformed Churches, as thoſe of <hi>Holland,</hi> there have been Decrees of Councils againſt them; And the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Churches did Prohibit them. But their Deſign was rather to Reſtrain the <hi>Abuſe,</hi> than to Condemn the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of them. They were commonly fill'd with Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and Untrue Praiſes of the Dead; and <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> pretends to give us
<pb facs="unknown:001365_0003_0FB2926773AD2428"/>
the Original of ſuch <hi>Orations.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Hilderſham</hi> therefore Ordered, That there ſhould be no <hi>Funeral Sermon</hi> for him. So did the Pious and Humble Mr. <hi>Carter</hi> of <hi>Bramford; Left</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſomething be ſaid in my Praiſe, beyond what is the Truth, and ſo I ſhould occaſion a Miniſter in his Pulpit, to ſpeak an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth, which would be a grievous Sin.</hi> His Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors obſerved his <hi>Will:</hi> But this hindred not Mr. <hi>Samuel Ward</hi> (the Glory of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi>) from Employing his next Lecture in Lamentations for the Loſs, which the Church of God, ſuſtained in the Death of a Perſon of ſuch Eminence and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. The <hi>Death</hi> of Men that have been <hi>Publick Bleſſings,</hi> ought Publickly to be taken notice of. The <hi>Elegy</hi> which <hi>David</hi> made upon <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> was a <hi>Funeral Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Relation to the Author, forbids me to Recommend the <hi>Funeral Sermon,</hi> which is here Publiſhed. The Deſign of it, is, more to Inſtruct the <hi>Living,</hi> than to Embalm the <hi>Dead.</hi> The Reader will find no <hi>Encomiums</hi> here, but what all

Truly, the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Man</hi> lies very much in <hi>Forgetfulneſs.</hi> For, firſt, <hi>Man</hi> did ſoon <hi>Forget</hi> his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God, and continues to do ſo. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, If <hi>Old Age</hi> comes upon a <hi>Man,</hi> he ſoon grows very <hi>Forgetful</hi> of Every thing; and it is a principal Infirmity and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>Old Age</hi> thus to do. Thirdly, It is the Fate of a <hi>Man</hi> to be ſoon <hi>Forgotten;</hi> he appears a very little while, and it is quickly <hi>Forgotten,</hi> that ever he was in the World. Behold, the Elegancy of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the Pſalms, where the Name of <hi>Enoſh</hi> is uſed; Pſal. 8.4. <hi>What is Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Forgotten Man, that thou ſhouldest Remember him!</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Enoſh</hi> indeed is a Name-ſake for every man, in this Aſſembly.

            </p>
            <p>Indeed all the <hi>Sorrows</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Name of <hi>Death.</hi> I am ſure, They tell us, <hi>That we are to die.</hi>

Yea, The very <hi>Supports</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> carry broad Intimations of our <hi>Dying</hi> in them.

his Life, muſt be to make ſome Good <hi>Improvement</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Muſt we Die?</hi> Then we ſhould Live in a Daily <hi>Expectation</hi> of our <hi>Death.</hi> A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God could ſay, 1 Cor. 15.31. <hi>I die daily.</hi> One thing in <hi>dying daily,</hi> is to Live with ſome Expectation <hi>every day,</hi> as if this may be the <hi>day of our death.</hi> I do not ſay, <hi>That a man ſhould Live every day, as if he knew it were to be the day of his death.</hi> A ſtrain, whereof the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be a little mended.

               </hi> which muſt be joyn'd with the <hi>Meditation</hi> of it. And this I am now to proceed unto.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Muſt we Dye?</hi> Then our Speedy, our Thorough <hi>Preparation</hi> for <hi>Death,</hi> is the ONE THING, that is needful for us.

            </p>
            <p>Here lies the Merit of the Caſe. The <hi>Last Thing</hi> that we can ſay, of this or that Man, is, <hi>And he Died.</hi> But this will not be the <hi>Laſt Thing</hi> that will befal the man.

            </p>
            <p>Of a <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> we read, Luk 16.22, 23. <hi>He died, and was buried, and in Hell he was in Torments.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of a Wicked man, is delivered over into the Hands of <hi>Devils.</hi> When one part of him, is <hi>Covered with the Shadow of Death,</hi> the other part of him is <hi>Broken in the place of Dragons.</hi> If the Relation might be given, it would be this; <q>
                  <hi>And he Died:</hi> But then his Depraved <hi>Soul</hi> was caſt into an horrid <hi>Priſon,</hi> where it lies in <hi>Chains of Darkneſs,</hi> waiting with Horror, for the <hi>Eternal Judgment</hi> of GOD.</q>

So the Relation muſt proceed, concerning the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a Godly Man, <q>
                  <hi>And he Died:</hi> But when his <hi>Body is Dead becauſe of Sin,</hi> his <hi>Spirit is Alive becauſe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi> His Renewed <hi>Soul</hi> puts on the <hi>Garments of Light:</hi> It fell into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Holy <hi>Angels;</hi> and in the <hi>Paradiſe of God,</hi> it keeps Joyfully Feeding on its <hi>Tree of Life;</hi> Joyfully looking for the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of the Great GOD our Saviour, when its Felicity will be Perfected, in the Rais'd and New <hi>Body</hi> to be beſtow'd upon it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe be the <hi>Conſequences,</hi> Oh! What <hi>Preparation</hi> is to be Endeavoured?</p>
            <p>And what is it that will Prepare us for <hi>Death;</hi> for <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> at our <hi>Death?</hi>

            <p>In one word, It is <hi>Converſion</hi> to GOD. It is that <hi>Good Work,</hi> whereof we read, Phil. 1.6. <hi>God hath begun a Good Work in you.</hi>

            <p>A GOVERNOUR greatly and juſtly Beloved among his People, <hi>[Tis no Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to Affirm, what Envy it ſelf can't De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny!]</hi> was Lately ſeen at the Head of One of our Colonies.

of all men, had the, <hi>True ſpirit of a Gentleman,</hi> will alwayes be Remembred with Eſteem among his People. I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, we are ſometimes affronted with <hi>Falſe Praiſes</hi> in <hi>Funeral Sermons;</hi> which deſerve as much to be derided, as thoſe Paſſages of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Oration were by the Senate, wherein he Cried up the <hi>Diſcretion</hi> of <hi>Claudius.</hi> I ſhall not be guilty of them, when I ſay of this our WINTHROP; He will be ever Mentioned, as he was highly Eſteemed, very Particularly, for his Courteous way of Treating all men, but eſpecially <hi>Good</hi> Men, and <hi>Old</hi> Men, on all occaſions; and for his <hi>Paternal,</hi> and <hi>Patient,</hi> and <hi>Generous</hi> Adminiſtration of the Publick Affairs.</p>

He flew back with an <hi>Olive-branch</hi> which prov'd a <hi>Garland</hi> unto him: The Obliged People (inſtead of an <hi>Obſidional Crown</hi> for him) Choſe him for their GOVERNOUR. They ſaid unto him, as the <hi>General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> of old ſaid unto <hi>Gideon, Rule thou over us, for thou haſt Delivered us.</hi> They found him a GOVERNOUR, that fully anſwered their Expectation.

            <p>And where, O Bereaved Colony, where will you now find a <hi>Strong Rod,</hi> by which your Government may be Carried on?
