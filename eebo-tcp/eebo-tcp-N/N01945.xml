            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

[upon a Preſumption that a fair, <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of Trade,</hi> or Commerce can no ways be upheld, or continued in this Great Province] our Deſtiny is very Apparent, and will come upon us like an <hi>Armed Man;</hi> for there will be no Evading, moſt Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Circumſtances in a Little Time; for that without a <hi>Medium,</hi> all things will Jumble, Run Retrograde, and Tumble into Caos; and this muſt needs fill us with many Evils both of Sin, and Miſery; as Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, Revilings of Governments, Injuſtice, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Diſcouragements; and poſſibly deſperation it ſelf in a very great Degree in our Temporal Affairs: For what will moſt Men care for, in ſuch a Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Condition, more than juſt to ſhuffle along thro' an Unfortunate World; and let them that come after e'en ſhift for themſelves? for what will deſpair, in Outward Affairs, Suggeſt leſs to any Man, <hi>Then when he is Dead the World is at an End.</hi> But to be brought to ſuch a Diſpoſition of Mind is a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the ſtate of Man: If it prevails in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it Damns him; and in Naturals it Undoes him, for that it Cuts the Throat of all Endeavours. That for my own part, I muſt therefore needs Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the wiſe Premonitions of thoſe who begin to feel the Stroke, who are nextly Expoſed; and where the Woes will fall firſt and Heavieſt, when things are Come to Extremity, and that is our Capital: Where Poſſibly Ten Thouſand Lives are houſed, and muſt be Supported by Trade, according to the Method they have been always Trained up in: Therefore if you Suppreſs, or let fall the <hi>Current Medium,</hi> they are abſolutely Undone, as to any thing that looks like a Flouriſhing Condition: And when our Head is ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Members of the Body will ſoon Languiſh.

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002311_0006_0FDB1EF6DB275EC8"/>
For that the Means of our Relief are in our own Hands; and we can ſave our ſelves, as Eaſily, as to ſay the Word. Indeed if we ſhould be ſo Corrupt, or Silly as to abandon our ſelves to Ruin, rather than uſe a plain Means for our Support we muſt then lye down and Dye. Or if when we are Cripled, we will ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly ſink down under the Stoke rather then uſe Crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, we may then ſpend the Reſt of our Days in ſelf Condolence over our Miſeries; but who will Pity us? and not rather Brand us for <hi>Self-Murderers;</hi> in that we have very Laudable Means, Honourable among Wiſe Men, and Juſtifiable before GOD, for our help; and that is a Bank of Credit, either under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of the Government, or in the Hands of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Gentlemen of Known Integrity and Eſtates.</p>

very proper Means. Sir</hi> Edward Cook <hi>that great Statesman and Oracle, allows the Bills to be very proper in a time of War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>If they are proper in War, why not in Peace?</hi> Indeed, it is an old Saying and a true one, Scil. <hi>Money is the Sinews of War.</hi> And if it be why not alſo in Peace? For I dont ſee how a People or Body Politick can well hang together without ſuch Sinews in Peace any more than in War. For the meaning is, that Money which Anſwers all things, is to Support, Carry on and Defray all Charges; and if a People have a full Supply of it, then they are ſtrong, and have good Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, Ligaments, Bones and what not to carry their Load, and go on with their Duty. And certainly, that Medium which will enable them in their Duty in War, will be of Equal Advantage in time of Peace. Which may be more evident if we diſtinguiſh between a Country that has a Sufficient Stock of Money as a Medium of Trade in time of Peace, (Sir <hi>Edward Cokes</hi> Caſe) but not ſo plentiful as to ſupply all the Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of War; therefore the Bills may be prudently made uſe of in ſuch a Caſe to enlarge their Stock. Now we muſt underſtand, that the Caſe is very different with a Country which has no Money at all: for if the Bills will ſuit and relieve the former in a time of War, they muſt needs be a very good Medium for the latter, both in the time of Peace as well as in War. Unleſs you will be ſo Raſh as to ſuppoſe a Country may do without any Medium at all in time of Peace; if they can have one in War: which to ſuppoſe is contrary to the ſuffrage of Mankind.

In our preſent Settlements, we are but like the Lift on the Cloth; whenas in an Age or Two more (with an ordinary Bleſſing) we might more than double our Country, in Number of Towns, and People; and the incouragement which may be given by the Bills of Credit (in the preſent Juncture of Affairs in the Chriſtian World) will certainly forward the Deſign abundantly.</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſe we admit of this Projection.

(to our Husbandry) in our Number of People, is but to talk Chymaerus. And tho' now in our preſent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, all good Houſholders do what they can, for Ordinary wear for a Family, to rub along with thro' much hard Labour, and Cold Winters; and ſo in the Run of the Year we, after a Faſhion, make up our Produce of Wool, &amp;c. But this is nothing like Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing the Effects of a large Country for a Foreign Vend. But when our Country is fill'd with People; and we can afford ſome Towns fully ſtock'd with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, Combers, and Weavers, &amp;c. And Farmers ſhall keep large Walks for Sheep, and every Man ſhall keep cloſe to his own Calling, then we may do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe in Manufactures, but not before. This ſeems plain, from the Examples of Old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where bring over-crowded with Inhabitants. they are fain to Beg, Steal or Fight for their Living, or Work for Six-pence or a Groat a Day, great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them. Therefore our Buſineſs is to incourage Settlements, with all Diſpatch, that we may put things into ſome good Forwardneſs, and leave a Wiſe Model for the next Age to go by. And the BILLS will do it all.</p>
               <p>This is very obvious, our Country, tho' of a pretty Auſtere Climate, yet if well and effectually managed, is capable of a Self-Subſiſtence, as fully as moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in the World. If I am not miſinformed, or miſtaken, the Juice of many of our Sweet Trees, and the Fruit of others, will yield a Generous Sugar. And if we cant well do with our Cyder, or without Wine, why may we not Cultivate the French Grape; we being many Degrees nearer the Sun than they. But if not, our Bees can do great Feats, if rightly managed, in producing a Generous Nectar, equal with the beſt of Wines in ſtrength and healthfulneſs. Alſo our Soil yields plenty of Corn, &amp;c. Feeds and Breeds all ſorts of Cattle, &amp;c. and is very natural in its productions
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002311_0031_0FDB1F32E5D5DE08"/>
to maintain an Excellent, Vaſt and Profitable Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture both of Woolen and Linnen. Wool, Flax, Hemp, are very natural to our Climate. And alſo the Iron Mine, but this does uſually eat up its Owners for want of Hands; and ſo will all the Reſt of our Manufactures do, as has been ſaid. Therefore the Buſineſs of our preſent Age is to incourage a Foreign Trade; and give it all the Support and Advantage we are Capable of; for moſt certainly with help of ſuch a Medium, and in ſuch Plenty, as by it we can eaſily Vend and Circulate our own preſent Produce and Effects; we can then Buy of our Merchants many neceſſary as well as convenient Things, cheaper than we can poſſible make them, and ſo ſave our Time by the Bargain, for other and more profitable Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is, and will be much for our Service to Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force our preſent Husbandry, ſo far as it ſpreads; Let the Farmer have all Due Incouragement, as before, &amp;c. But in a peculiar manner, it is our Wiſdom to promote the increaſe of our Plantations, and Multiplying the Number of our People, Our Bills will Support us in all theſe Affairs if the Almighty will give us the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It is moſt Certain GOD gives us many wiſe cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to correct Inordinacy, and all Sinful diſtruſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Things of this Life: But he has left it as a Charge upon our Nature, to Propagate our Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: And alſo has denounced many a heavy Penalty to conſtrain us Faithfully to preſerve and uphold His Kingdom; And Civil Government, and good Order in His Empire.

All manner of Aſperſions caſt upon them by Fear or jealouſies muſt be wip't off, and they be look'd upon as the Beſt of Pawns, and better: than Money in hand; This muſt be our Rule, becauſe the Fund is firm at Bottom; and the Government which has the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will do that which is Good, Right and Equal to all Men. And alſo for the ſake of our own private and Publick Good. Such a temper of Mind will for ever, not only ſecure the Currency of our Bills; but will moſt certainly keep up their Value equal with Money; or to ſuch a Degree, as by juſt proportion ought to be: and this is beſt of all. For,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt not judge we have loſt in the value of our Bills, from ſome experience we have had in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of them, when they have ſeemed to ſink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their due Eſtimation.</hi> For at their beginning they were (generally ſpeaking) par with Money, and many times preferable to it, for at times Men would allow 25<abbr>s</abbr> or 50<abbr>s</abbr> per Cent. in Money for the Bills. And tho' it is alſo certain when Men had Clipt the Money down to Fifteen-penny weight, Bills fell alſo to that value in ordinary Trade; yet this informs us that the Bills were ſtill held equal with Money: but after the Money and Bills had with equal Currency paſt at that rate for ſome Years; ſome particular Men who had Bonds for Lawful Money againſt their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours would refuſe the Bills unleſs Two &amp; eight pence upon the Bills were added to make them full Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002311_0034_0FDB1F3DCFE43CC0"/>
penny; yet in theſe Times ſome Men made no odds either in Uſe or in their Principal. And again, When the Money was more drained out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and grown more ſcarce, then ſome particular Creditors (tho' not all) demanded Two Shillings more to be added to the Bills to make them compleatly the Silver Specie. Yet under all theſe Alterations, it is to be obſerved that the Bills paſt, with as great a Currency as the Money.</p>
               <p>But moreover, the Bills ſeem to have loſt a Point in their Reputation by certain Emergencies, that have not been ſo well obſerved; or ſome Caſualties which happened, before or about the time when they grew more plentiful. As for Inſtance, The Britiſh Fleet was ſome Means of Raiſing the Price of our live Stock, there was alſo in ſome of the late Years, a conſiderable ſcarcity of ſalt Proviſions, for the ſupport of the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and of Shipping, for that Pork was not imported ſo plentifully as at other Times. And alſo there was a great reſort of Foreign Ships of Trade, that whilſt here, mainly Victualled with our freſh proviſions: And our Fiſhery alſo ſupplied it ſelf from a Weekly Slaughter in a great Meaſure: So that all Provſions grew to a great height, to what they had been, and made it ſeem as tho' the fault had been in the Bills; when as under ſuch Circumſtances, if we had had our Silver in equal Proportions, as ordinarily; there would have been poſſibly no great odds in Prices; and that becauſe of the preſent Scarcity &amp; large Vend. Whence it muſt needs be great Weakneſs in any to infer the inſufficiency of the Bills from what has paſt hitherto; for if they do they are very weak Logicians, or elſe have miſt of the True Premiſes, as has been now Recited.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This One Particular may further be obſerved, which may rationally preſage their riſing and keeping High Enough in all our Affairs: <hi>For that however
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002311_0035_0FDB1F4099B442E0"/>
Times have been, yet the Bills have done all the Buſineſs of our Country, they were Ordained for.</hi> And alſo tho' many hard Demands were made upon them on the account of Money Obligations, yet it was far better to the Debtor, than to have paid the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie Indented for; becauſe the Bills were to be had upon Reaſonable Terms, but the Money was not; it being almoſt quite gone out of the Country; and had left many Men under heavy Bonds, (ſo ſickle is it in its own nature) which the Bills by their Currency Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, tho' with ſuch an Allowance. So that at that Rate they were really and truly better to us than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Indeed if their Currency had been Blank'd or Baffled in any of our Great Affairs, either as to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Debts and Obligations; or more Publick Duties, we might have ſome fair Plea againſt them.</p>
               <p>As ſuppoſe the Publick Miniſtry in Church or State had ſlighted them.</p>
               <p>Or, if the Merchants had demurred, or frowned, and ſaid, Gentlemen! Theſe Paper Tickets; we will have nothing to do with them; they won't ſo much as pay Ware and Tare; much leſs Reimburſt our Coſtly Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go's; No! We can't part with our Braſs, Copper, Pewter, with our Bread-Cloths, Silks and Scarlet, upon theſe Terms.</p>
               <p>Or if the Farmer had ſhockt up his Shoulders, and ſaid, Theſe Tickets will not Anſwer for Fine Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor pay for Raiſing, Graſing and Staling Fat Oxen. Therefore for our Parts, we will neither med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle nor make with them. Such Affronts and Checks had been an effectual Eſtoppel to them; and might have ſunk all Men into deſpair of their riſing to an equal Value with Money; but there is nothing of this Nature has appeared; but all ſorts of Men have taken them in ſupporting all their Affairs; and they have been ſo Convenient, Good and Acceptable, that we have now I ſuppoſe iſſued all Specialties, And have Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002311_0036_0FDB1F4235B98E28"/>
all Trade, Debts and Obligations upon their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and a preſumption of their continuance; which ſignifies the high Eſteem and Value which we have for them; and in that we have no other Medium to depend upon, this will be as high in Eſtimation, as Men in Juſtice and Reaſon can expect. For,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>All Men of Senſe and Humanity (but ſuch who Love themſelves more than all Mankind beſides) will allow, That it is too hard a Fate for Men of good Conduct to ſpend their Days in Rolling the Stone of Siſyphus: But that by their Frugality and Painful Improvement of the Means of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, they ought to make a clear Gain, as being most agreeable with the Law of God and Nature.</hi> And if our Bills will admit of this, as a Medium of Trade, as well or Better than Money: And when they are at ſuch a Pitch and Degree, as to accompliſh this end: We may then juſtly affirm, that they are in our Caſe equal or Superiour to Money. For if they will do all the Buſineſs, and keep us thriving, will not this be as good as Money? Yea, I am very ſure it will, and better too: For that the Money Medium has been the Means of our Oppreſſion, rather than of our Flouriſhing State, as has been ſaid. It is not a little Sprinkling of Money, which is always upon the Wing, or Bobbing up and down like <hi>Tantalus</hi> his Apples, that will make a Country Rich. But it is Diligence, Frugality; and the Circulation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, with a clear Gain and Profit to every Man, whereby he is fully Recompenced for the uſe of his Prime Stock; for his Labour, and the Riſque which he runs: But I am very well perſwaded, Money has never done this as a Medium in <hi>New-England;</hi> nor nothing near it: Eſpecially as to Farmers, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, which is the great Studd &amp; Strength of our Country: Therefore abundance if not gone behind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and hard Fare, have turned like the Door on the Hinge, as tho' Sluggards, whenas the Fault has been in the Medium of Trace, on which they have depended, Scil. <hi>In the Money Times.</hi> This ſeems very plain in many, but I ſhall conſider it but in one Example, viz. <hi>In Neat Cattle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here let us imagine, how long, and cold our Winters are; and what care, time, houſing and fod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt be imployed, and ſpent upon a Stock of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to Raiſe, Feed, and fit them for the Market, &amp;c. Now can any Rational Man [that knows any thing of this Affair] Judge it agreeable with any Points of Equity, the Rules of Fellowſhip, and profit; for Men to ſell their Cattle, as they have been Conſtrained to do, in the Money Times. <hi>Scil.</hi> Five or Six Pounds for a Yoke of Oxen when Lean; or for Six or Seven Pounds when Fat? And as for thoſe which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Lay'n upon charge till they have come to the Market, <hi>viz.</hi> young Cattle coming four; theſe have commonly been Sold at Thirty or Forty Shillings per Head, which has not made out near the Prime Coſt. And if ſo this is but little better then taking their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for their Pains; which is Certainly a very poor Method for Farmers to grow Rich by.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> If the Bills have been the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Reſcue by eaſing ſuch Points, &amp;c. then tho' they dont come up to the Rigorous Value, and Price of Money, when it was a meer Etxtortioner, or but little better than a common Robber: Yet if they bring things nearer to the Rule of Equity; and Adjuſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Commerce ſo fairly, that all Men may live and thrive, upon their Labour and Profits; this is to bring the Bills to ſuch a Level, as the Money ought to be at in a Country of Trade, and Religion, whete Men ſhould love their Neighbours as themſelves; and do as they would be done by; and therefore ſhould be Willing, that others ſhould live Proſperouſly upon
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002311_0038_0FDB1F467338A7D8"/>
their Means, their Incomes, Labour, and Profits, as well as themſelves. And when it is thus in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and thro' Mercy it has thus happened with us under the Government of our Bills: Now from what has been ſaid, the Conſequence is not that the Bills are fallen below the juſt value of Money; but the meaning of it is, that our Native produce is Riſen, and brought up to a due Value, or Eſtimation, by the Improvement of the Bills; which ought to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all good Chriſtians, and Common Wealthsmen. And this may be further ſupported by the Judicious. Opinion of Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his Tenure by Rents, [and indeed in ſome ſenſe all our Lands are Rent Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure-Lands; as we owe and muſt pay for them an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Income to Church and State] Therefore [ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Sir <hi>Edward</hi>] If Trade and Commerce be maintained, ſo that our Native Commodities, and Produce of our Country, which are Rich, Neceſſary, and Coſtly Things; without which we cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt; If theſe be holden up at a good Rate; and be kept ſalable at ſuch a Value, that the Labourer and Farmer may make a clear Profit by them, then may Tenants do their Duty to their Landlords the better; and they themſelves live like Men.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But does not this hurt all Salary Men by keeping up the Prices of our own Produce?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer 1. <hi>The Country has by the Money Medium, and the Indians, been kept, near Fourty Years in low Circumſtances, to what they might have attained to, if they had had better Neighbours, and a better Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of Trade.</hi> And many Precincts have been ſet off, &amp;c. Such Things have without Doubt kept the Salary at a lower Ebb, &amp;c. But howſoever,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As the Money was to blame for ſetting the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries ſo low in the time of its Government; ſo let the Salaries now Riſe proportionably by the good Fortune of the Bills; then none can complains of ill

(1) Between a full Stock of Money, and no Money at all, or that which is next to none. And this you will find to make a great odds in the Caſe. For if there be no Money, or that which is next to none in our Country; &amp; we infer that the Bills are of no Value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wont purchaſe Money; or really are of no more Value, but only of ſo much as they will in Fact procure in Money; this is a very corrupt and fallacious Method, in adjuſting between Money &amp; the Bills. Yet ſo far as I can perceive, this is accounted, the Crime, and Ground of Proceſs againſt the Bills. That is to ſay, becauſe the Bills will not now purchaſe Shilling for Shilling and Pound for Pound, in good Dry Money, Pieces of Eight, at Seventeen-penny-half-penny-weight, <hi>Therefore the Sentence is paſt, that they muſt be Burnt, as tho' they were State Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> whenas there is not a Shilling to be ſeen or heard of in ordinary Commerce or Converſation.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> By this kind of Judicature you may Indict Gold and Silver for Inſignificant Fools; or empty Cyphers, in the Affairs of Mankind; and affirm that this Silver Money has quite loſt its Value, and is become good for nothing. For that the time was a Man may ſay, that I could have bought good Wheat at <hi>Four Shillings</hi> in Money per Buſhel, and now its all gone out of Town and Country; that if I would give <hi>Forty Shillings</hi> for a Peck I can't get it.

But it is a very Corrupt Judgment [by ſuch Pleas] is drawn up againſt the Bills. For in our own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience when the Money was moſt plentiful the Bills were equal, and in many Inſtances ſuperiour to the Money, as has been laid. And do but Reduce your Money again, bring it on to the Spot; and I will hold you a wager of <hi>Five Hundred Pounds,</hi> the Bills ſhall in our ordinary Way of Trade and Commerce be of higher Value and Eſtimation then the Money; Only you ſhall be Bound, to oblige the Money to keep at home as honeſtly and conſtantly as the Bills do. Thus it is in <hi>Holland</hi> and in <hi>Venice,</hi> Examples which I ſhall make farther uſe of by and by.</p>
               <p>Therefore Good Sirs! Dont be raſh againſt your Bills, leaſt you Kill the beſt Servant you ever had, without ſufficient and legal Evidence, for if you do, it will be a kind of Murder; and may be, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of when it is too late.</p>

Whenas if our Money was in our Country in equal proportions with our Bills, it would be the ſame in all our Trade: Nay the Bills would be preferable to the Money; for thus it is in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> where they have as much nay more Money than they have Bills. And the Reaſon of it is as bright as the light at noon Day. For that they are altogether Independent as in their Government; ſo in their Merchandize, that when in their Trade Gold and Silver comes to them as the chance may be; they are under no awe or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to any Foreign and Kingly Merchants to drain them [from any neceſſity] of that Specie; therefore their Money is Colleague with their Bills, and Dwells as intirely at home as tho' a Priſoner; and yet is in all Mens hands, &amp;c. and equal in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the Bills; and yet the Bills in <hi>Holland</hi> are <hi>Three Pounds per Cent</hi> better than Money, and in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> 20 l. But the Caſe is quite otherways with as, as has been fairly diſtinguiſhed, and that is becauſe, we have no Money at all; and if we get it we can't keep it, in our preſent Capacity.</p>
               <p>Therefore Good <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> Out of Love to your Country, and the Civil Well-being of it, Ponder theſe things Wiſely; and be perſwaded to keep up your noble Fund; keep it full; and full enough, which ſo ſuits your Climate, and your Circumſtances; And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate all Prejudice againſt ſo noble and wiſe a Projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as your Bills comprehend, and then your Bills will be as good as Money.</p>

And tho' the Produce of our Country has riſen under their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, to the incouragement of the Oppreſſed Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet have not been ſo proſtituted by the Folly or Knavery of any, but that they have kept up a great Credit, and Currency to this Day.

our Bills are not Founded in Money; yet are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Publick Faith; and derive from a Land Security, which is better then Money, from its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, or immutability.

Their Bills of Publick Credit have been exceeding ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in ſupporting their Worldly Affairs: And yet poſſibly, for ſome ſcores, if not for ſome hundreds of Years, have not kept one Ducket in their Publick Treaſury to keep up the Credit of them.</p>
               <p>Take the following account from a Credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> relating to this Affair, viz.</p>
               <p>Bills wherever Banks have been erected (tho' Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Banks) always have been of better Value than Money in Specie.</p>
               <p>Whereof three Reaſons may be given.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſon. <hi>For the eaſe of Compting, and Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and preventing Damage to the receiver by Counterfeit, Clipped, Light or Baſe Coin, (which is obvious to all.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Reaſon. <hi>For Safety in Travelling, Laying up, &amp;c. as viſible as the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Reaſon. <hi>For the Advantage that is to be made by the Exchange, on the account of ſuch convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> Whereof take two Examples, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Example. <hi>The Bank Bills of Holland, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily better than Money, by at least Three Pounds per Cent.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But how is that poſſible or Credible?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is this Account rendered of it (which has confirmation by many other Inſtances that might be given concerning the current Prices of many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which have not ſo much of intrinſick Value in them) <hi>viz.</hi> The State of <hi>Venice</hi> Propounded the Erecting a Bank to conſiſt of <hi>Two Millions of Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets</hi> (comprehending <hi>Six Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi>) accordingly Monies were brought in, and Bills given

out for the ſame Value; and a ſtop put to the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, or giving out any more of either. The uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Bills was ſuddenly found to be ſuch in the practice, and employment of them, upon the three forementioned Accounts, that every M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n at one time or another, found his Affairs required them; ſo that at firſt ſuch Bills would not be parted with for Money, under <hi>Ten Shillings per Hundred Pounds:</hi> And no ſooner was that become the Current Rate; but they were ſucceſſively raiſed, by <hi>Ten Shillings</hi> at a time, till they come to be in every ones Eſtimation 28 <abbr>l</abbr> per Cent. better than Money in Specie; and ſo paſſed accordingly. Whereupon the State of <hi>Venice</hi> Enacted ſeveral Laws againſt their paſſing ſo high, which failing to accompliſh what was Required; at length they conceived it neceſſary, in order to the bringing down the Price, to propoſe the giving forth Bills, for <hi>Three Hundred Thouſand Duckets</hi> more, By which means they brought it back to <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> per Cent. (which pleaſed the People) And then fixt it, from riſing higher afterwards by a ſevere Law. Since when, it ſtands ſo to this day: and this is no more than what is familiar in the Price of other things, <hi>viz.</hi> Diamonds, Rubies, Pearls, Horſes, Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;c. which have their Eſtimation from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pleaſures and Fancies of Men, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And if it be demanded. <hi>What induced that State to allow it ſo high?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwer is eaſy: <hi>viz.</hi> The State of <hi>Venice</hi> had made uſe of the Monies Depoſited, in their Publick Occaſions, (where obſerve the Hazard of a Money Bank,) and having promiſed for Satisfaction of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, to raiſe the like Sum, if they ſhould have occaſion for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they Reap this Advantage of their Peoples high Opinion of the Bills, that they are thereby aſſured, that never will any Creditor come to ask them a 100 <abbr>l</abbr> for a Bill of a 100 <abbr>l</abbr> when he may have a 120 <abbr>l</abbr> from
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002311_0047_0FDB1ED1643760A8"/>
another hand. A notable way to pay a Vaſt-Debt. But by means hereof, the Creditor has no other Fund, or Security but the States Word: for there is not one Ducket for them in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> Let me Pray you, with Sedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Thought to peruſe and think over theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Famous Examples, in the Affairs and Wiſe Managements of Civil States.</p>
               <p>Conſider the Men, the Means, and Concommitants, Conſequents and Effects which follow, &amp;c. and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh well, and like true lovers of your Country, and I am ready peremptorily to conclude, you will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that theſe Examples now laid before you, carry in their Aſpect Good and Happy Omens towards us; And that if we are not under invincible Prejudice, or ſunk into Deſpair: but are yet capable of receiving influence for our Civil and Temporal Good; we muſt needs by ſuch Examples, and from the deep Wiſdom, State-Reaſon, and Policy in them, be raiſed to a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Reſolution, to make uſe of the like Means, for the vaſt Benefit of us, and ours: And why not from Generation to Generation, (and that without Boggling) as the Renowned <hi>Venice</hi> has done? Unleſs we ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect we ſhall grow too Rich, too Great and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider Perſons; And I cannot think, but you will allow, ſo far as Imagination is neceſſary in raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Glory, and value of a thing, the People of this Province are as capable as any other:</hi> For that certainly we carry as much of the <hi>Lapis Aurificus,</hi> or <hi>Philoſophers Stone</hi> in our heads, and can turn other matter into Silver or Gold by the Power of thought as ſoon as any other People, or elſe I muſt own I have not yet Learnt the Character of my Country.

For that our Bills are upon a Land fund, or ſecurity, and the Publick faith to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it; and the Government to manage it, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and ſee that every thing ſhall be done in the iſſue and termination, as becomes a wiſe Government. Then where is there any room left for Baffling, Doubting or Heſitation, where Men have any Love for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and a publick Spirit in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>As to Effects, Conſequents, Concomitants, &amp;c.</hi> They are very numerous, in every State relating to this Subject; and in Times, Places and Examples very Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As to our own Concerns, to paſs all other Remarks, this is an attendant on our State, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> A Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of Trade it muſt be had, its indiſpenſibly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; our Money, that little we had is gone; we have had long Experience of the uſefulneſs and profit of the Paper Medium; as has been ſaid: It does all our Buſineſs, hurts no Man, but bleſſes all Men (but what is purely Accidental, &amp;c.) The whole Country in this Projection have been Owners (by their own Creation) of a Better, and more valuable Treaſure, and of clearer Profit in the uſe and management of their Bills: than the Mines of <hi>Mexico</hi> are to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were theſe laſt obliged to make good all out-ſets.</p>
               <p>We have poſſibly from the firſt Projection Exhibited half a Million in Bills of Credit: It is a mighty Eſtate, and acquired with little or no Coſt. Whereas if thoſe who work upon the Mines in <hi>Peru</hi> &amp; <hi>Mexico,</hi> were allowed but a Bisket-Cake for Proviſions, and a Penny a Day for Wages, they would run the Crown, and Owners deeply in Debt, as is Reported. That cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Our Mine, which we work upon is Richer than theirs: for that we can cleanſe Ours from the Oar, and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002311_0049_0FDB1F609CDF4BE0"/>
Run it into Coin, at about <hi>Fifty Shillings</hi> per Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound. And if ſo, ſuppoſe we cannot bring our Bills up ſo high as <hi>Venice</hi> has theirs, nor reach to the rigorous Value which our own Money his ſtood at? Yet notwithſtanding we may venture by the Power of Thought to conclude them in our own Concerns, to be as good yea better than Money. For we muſt conſider, our Medium is our own; it coſt us little or nothing: And yet will keep us Loyal and Obedient to our PRINCE, by (hearfully) Supporting Church and State. And alſo juſt and Equal in our Trade and Dealings one with another; And make us Great, Rich and Flouriſhing in our Outward Affairs: And what can any Medium do more for any People?</p>

(3) Where Money (as in our Caſe) is not to be had, to Support the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Government muſt of neceſſity, Annually Emit ſuch a Number of Bills, as will Anſwer the Publick Charge, both in Peace and War. For to do it by the Corn, and Proviſion Specie, it will ſoon be found intollerable: For that when the Bills are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and Circulate, it will be an eaſe to Officers, and alſo to the People, &amp;c. for every Man may pay his Aſſeſsment, as he ſits in his Chair; he need never Tackel up his Team to tranſport his Burthenſome Loads to the Seat of Government; and when it comes there, poſſibly it muſt lye, and fat the Rats and Mice, whilſt it waits for a Market, &amp;c. Now under this Preſumption that the Government will think it beſt to keep our Bills in their own proper Buſineſs; if a Bank be Erected by Private Gentlemen, this will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion various ſorts of Money in our Country, and this may be as the Cholick in our Bowels; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thoſe Men who run that venture, and thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe the whole Fund, for the Advance of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Trade, as well as for their own Profit, muſt needs be eſteemed great Benefactors to the Publick; and to treat them with any thing that looks like Surprize, or Tricking, will not be Honourable, nor agreeable with Wiſdom, if any miſchance ſhould happen, &amp;c. This is to ſignify that theſe are the Men that lye at Stake, and are only in hazard. For thoſe who take the Bills in the Circulation of them, have the Publick Faith to reſt

                  <p>AS to a Private Bank (peculiarly ſo conſidered) there be very good reaſons to be given why a particular Company or ſuitable Gentlemen, ſhould be Intruſted with ſuch a Grand Affair for the ſervice of a Country. (<hi>Scil.</hi> Under the Inſpection of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp;c.) That is to ſay, In our Caſe, if our Country and Government find their own Rank (as to their Apprehenſion, &amp;c.) is fateagued, with ſome ſuch incumberments, and inconſiſtences, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can, nor will diſpence with. As to Inſtance, firſt in the loſs of the Money, they cant bear it, but will try for the Recovering of it, &amp;c. And alſo, as to the value of the Bills they will not be contented to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002311_0052_0FDB1F6521A45DA0"/>
ſet down with the deciſion that common Trade, and Commerce has hitherto made on this Point, For ſays abundance of Men (and may be very wiſe Men tool) let every Body ſay what they will, and with their fine flouriſhes Paliate the matter: Yet its Plain enough, the Money has been two hard for the Bills, and apparently has made a Fool of them: And tho' the Bills have kept the Houſe; and the Money is gone from home; as tho' it had been turned out of Doors for a wrangler; yet the Bills have not done their Office fully, or played their part as was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And they are ſo qualified in their own Nature; and ſo ſoft and apt to warp, that no Government can ſo ſtiffen them, but when all is ſaid and done as can be, they will remain, but a leaden rule in meaſuring Exchanges, &amp;c. And therefore the Country is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to call in all out-ſtanding Bills, and in convenient time diſſolve their Bank; and try for the Money Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium; for that there be abundance of Men, that have theſe Idea's, <hi>Scil.</hi> Let the Bills be all Burn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; and the Money will come. Now, if we are reduced to ſuch a notion of things; and to ſuch a Reſolution; there is then, apparently very great, and ſtrong Pleas, why a particular Company of Gentlemen ſhould erect a Bank of Credit; for that it is very plain, upon the foreſaid Hypotheſis, ſuch a Projection will no ways hinder, but help and bring to Birth the foreſaid Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and hopes; but to throw up the preſent Fund, and leave all our Affairs open to chance and hap-haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; without ſubſtituting another for the ſake of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, will be to murder our Temporal Buſineſs; and at once undo our ſelves. So that if the Country is quite heart ſick with their own meaſures; I am very well aſſured, upon a very good Argument, that a Pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vate Bank ſhall cure them, and do every thing to their Satisfaction. I ſhall with all convenient Brevity, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a few Preliminary Thoughts Relating to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

Subject; and then point at Perſons proper to be intruſted with the Affair; and the Reaſons of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Few preliminary Thoughts, wherein I ſhall diſtinguiſh between a Publick and Private Bank. Viz. <hi>Imprimis, A Publick Bank of Credit, as ſomewhat Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us; yet it carries a vaſt Bounty with it to thoſe Countries who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve the Wiſdom to give it an Honourable Reception: But to others it is but a Common Plague.</hi> There be Two Principles abſolutely needful to preſerve it in a Country, viz. Prudence, and a Publick Spirit in Head Men of Eſtates; if ſuch Men will but wiſely govern their Private Intereſts in favor of it; they will ſoon ſhackle other Mens; and Bridle their Recuſancy, and bring them to confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. A Wiſe Government may Project, but it is Wiſe and Great Men under Government, that muſt Cultivate ſuch a Projection, for a Publick Good. Therefore where the Principal Men of Eſtates and Trade will become Patrons, (tho' not perſonally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved) this will ſupport it. I do imagine the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Reaſon not of the Being, but of the Proſperous and Flouriſhing State, of thoſe Famous Banks (that have been mentioned) owe for their Glory, to this Temper of Mind, in the Principal Gentlemen of the ſeveral Countries, where they were Erected.</p>
                  <p>That is thus. At the firſt Commencement and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of thoſe Funds, we muſt imagine, theſe Men payed a great Veneration to the Bills: And there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Trade going forward, peculiarly under their Management; and alſo many Credits, and Bonds for Lawful Money, againſt other Men, &amp;c. It was after this manner, &amp;c. [1] As to their Trade, when Men come to buy a Supply with the Bills; they accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them at the Old Money Price, and take the Bills without Higling or making any diſtinction, &amp;c. And (2.) As to their Bonds, and Obligations for Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002311_0054_0FDB1F6526EE1C38"/>
when the Debtor comes; poſſibly he inquires. Sir! there is a Bond of <hi>One Thouſand Duckets</hi> in your hands againſt me, will you take Bank Bills? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>Bank Bills Man!</hi> There's nothing will ſuit me better than Bank Bills: For I muſt tell you, I have that high Opinion of the Bills, that I will abate part of my Intereſt, if you will clear the reſt, and the whole Principal by the Bills. I do aſſure you my good Friend, and you may tell it to all your Neighbours, that we in the Merchandize do prefer the Bills above the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, &amp;c. Now ſuch a prudent Temper Circulating, and Influencing the Principal Members of ſuch a Grand Community, will ſoon become a Law for all other Men, &amp;c. Thus it has been in <hi>Holland, Venice, New-York, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on the other hand, Where the Bills <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ve gone up and down and been Ridiculed. Its owing to head Men and Men of Fortune, <hi>Avice Verſa,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>France, Sweedland, and South-Carolina,</hi> &amp;c. Now, it ſeems to me plain that if thoſe Civil powers or States that have ſtood and look't on and ſeen their Noble Projections for the Advance of Trade trampled upon, and could not poſſibly prevent the Proſtitution, if they had (I ſay) when they diſcerned things lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into ſuch Confuſion, Reſigned the Management of the Bank to principle &amp; ſuitable Gentlemen, or turned their publick into a private Bank; they might have eaſily Recovered the Glory and Sufficiency of their Bank, &amp;c. Eſpecially if ſupporting and Reinforcing the Bequeſtment with due Sanctions. As, (1.) That the profit, ſhall be fixed in the Truſtees, &amp;c. (2.) That the Government inſpect, &amp;c. (3.) That the Bills ſhall be held as Current and Lawful Money, in anſwering all Aſſeſments, and alſo in diſcharging all Creditors, to the Publick, as their own Bills, &amp;c. And tho' in this Method, the ſenſible profit ſeems a Booty

to ſome particular Men; but the General Good by keeping up a valuable Medium for all Buſineſs, is as equally beneficial to all Men in common, as tho' done by the Government. So it will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſay ſuch Men by their Example, and wiſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement can do more to bring things right, and keep them ſo; then all the Menaces, Penal Laws, or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a Government. I have not yet underſtood that the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with all his bigg and Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Looks, or Imperial Orders, could ever Reſcue his Bank Bills from the Contempt they met with in his Common Markets. Now I ſay, it appears to me, that there may be ſuch Gentlemen involved in this Affair, who can (upon the aforeſaid Preſumptions) do more than the Government, or any regular Monarch on Earth. I ſhall juſt point at ſuch Men as the proper in this Caſe. Scil. Landed M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. Great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who (tho' worth many Thouſands) keep the main of their Perſonal Eſtate, ſtating in a way of Trade, &amp; Merchadize, both in their own and other Countries. Alſo ſuch other Gentlemen, Men of great Eſtates, and of great Wiſdom, who tho' they keep up a very Conſiderable Trade, and Merchandize, yet let out much at Intereſt; and as their Gains this way is leſs,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002311_0056_0FDB1F6BDDF8E1D0"/>
ſo alſo is their Riſque: There is a ſort of Wiſe and very Prudent Men, that are a kind of <hi>Amphibians</hi> beings who live in both Elements, Land and Water, theſe are Eminently Qualified, as Members for a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Bank. And alſo Rich Farmers, and Mechannicks, Men of Character, and Influence (according to their Sphere) in the Places where they live. The main of theſe Men muſt belong to our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and other Sea-Ports and Towns of Trade, and others to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed thro' the Province. A Convenient Company of ſuch Perſons ſo Qualified, and Incorporated, I do Imagine, ſhall be capable to carry on a Bank of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with greateſt Advantage, with an Immenſe good and Benefit to the Publick. For new being intruſted by the Government with the Outward happineſs, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, and flouriſhing State of their Country; being alſo inſtituted, not meerly for their own Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; but to promote the Publick Good, they muſt needs act in ſuch a Sphere in ſome proportion like the Government it ſelf; as being now become Publick Benefactors, and Common Fathers to their Country; and being Men of Noble and Great minds; muſt and will conſult the Good of other Men, as well as their own. And that ſuch a Community are capable of doing great Service in this Affair, is obvious from the following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Reaſons are,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For that this Company of Gentlemen can Regulate the Prices of all Things Yearly in the common courſe of Trade, and Commerce. The wild and inſulting Prices of Things have ruined the Foreign Banks, &amp;c. And poſſibly ſomething of this Nature has been a Deminution to our own, &amp;c. Now there is a ſovereign Remedy provided in this Projection, againſt ſuch an inconveniency, and miſchief. For by the Wiſdom, Precautions, Example of theſe Men, they
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002311_0057_0FDB1F70DD0A20B8"/>
will thereby conduct all ſuch Points, as tho' Control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>olute Maſters of the Market, and yet hurt no Mans Property, or Infringe Liberty; and hereby Equity in Commerce will be better upheld; Exceſſive Demands ſuppreſſed; the Honour and Credit of the Medium maintained; And the Juſt and Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gains and profits of all Men ſuited and ſecured. For we muſt further note, that they are Men of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Functions, and their own Intereſts, as well as Honour, Wiſdom and Honeſty, will oblige them always to ſteer right, and do well for other Men; for if they hurt others, they hurt themſelves. And no Man need ſuſpect or fear, no not a Knave, much leſs a wiſe and honeſt Man under this head. For that it is a very ſure Maxim, viz. <hi>Self Intereſt will neither Cheat or Lye: For that this is the String in the Noſe (thro' the World) which governs the Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For that this Projection will both keep up the Value, and alſo the Circulation of the Bills; and in a great Meaſure prevent hoarding for the future, and correct it at the preſent. I am not ſo ſeen into the Capacity, State, Produce, Trade, and Buſineſs of my Country, as to be Peremtory; yet do imagine, that our Medium at this Day, as to our outſtanding Bills, is not near Sufficient for the whole Trade of this Country, and a great part of them, poſſibly is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. Some Men it is very probable, do according to their Uſage, their Income, and Trade, Annually yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſiderable Surpluſage, to what they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to paſs away (Lay it up) till Opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to Let it out at Intereſt, &amp;c. This ſeems to make ſome ſtop, or divert the common ſtream. But many others (as ſome Men Jealous) keep cloſe what they can lay Hands on, for a peculiar Market. And its well if more then one Third of our Supply and preſent Stock is not ſtopt by this means, like Stagnate Waters,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002311_0058_0FDB1F736A7C24F8"/>
in Pits and Mud-holes. And I doubt there be a great many Men, ſubtile in Buſineſs, who by their Politick Meaſures, make Goods do, when they ſhould rather paſs away Bills, that they may keep Circulating, &amp;c. But however when the Principal Men of our Country, ſhall be involved in the management aboveſaid, ſuch things will in likelihood be ſolved, &amp;c. and ſo the Common Fountain will, as indeed it ſhould, always move and Circulate, like the Main Ocean. This great Body was Ordained, to ſupply the Earth with Showers; with Rivers, and ſmaller Streams, for the ſatisfying the Thirſt, and nouriſhment of every living Thing: Even the Plants, Birds and Worms, are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by its Bounty; and then the Tributary Clouds, and Springs repay themſelves to the Seas. So it ſhould be in our Caſe, and the means propoſed, carries ſuch a proſpect with it, that the future, and alſo the preſent State of things for Hoards, will ſoon diſſolve upon ſuch an inſtitution, or ſurrender.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> From the Capacity that many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of the Kings very Good and Loyal Subjects are reduced to, in their Temporal Affairs, upon a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Paper Medium, and the Continuation of it; <hi>That to Suppreſs it will be attend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Finally, For that this Projection will be a Remedy, for that which many Men grown under as our greateſt Misfortune; unleſs the Caſe is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
