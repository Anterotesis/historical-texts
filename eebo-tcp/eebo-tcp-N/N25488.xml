            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A ſhort <hi>SKETCH,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MR. LENT MUNSON, the ſon of Lieut. <hi>Levi Munſon,</hi> now of Harwinton, in Connecticut, was born in <hi>Wallingford,</hi> the 3d of March 1768. In the 10th year of his age, he entered as a muſician into the Continental Army, where he continued until the eſtabliſhment of peace; after which he joined the family, who had in his abſence removed to Harwinton. Here he reſided until the year 1787, when he again entered into the ſervice of his country, in the corps raiſed by Col. David Humphreys, with the rank of Sergeant-Muſician. The ſhort duration of that command ſoon left him again under the direction of his parents, where he continued until the year 1788,— when he once more determined upon a military life. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he went to Hartford, and engaged for the term of three years; and joined the army at Fort Harmer, in the Weſtern Country; where he performed the duty of Muſician until early in the year 1789, when he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the rank of Quarter Maſter-Sergeant to the garriſon, in both of which ſtations his conduct was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable. In December 1790, orders came out at Fort Waſhington, where Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> then was ſtationed, for re-enliſting the men. He engaged for three years more, and was ſoon after ordered to Connecticut on the recruiting ſervice. He was ſtationed at Middletown, where he continued in that duty until 1793, when he joined the army again at Fort Waſhington. During his reſidence at Middletown, he cultivated an acquaintance with many reſpectable inhabitants of that city, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his humble rank in life, diſcovered his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> the command of Lieut. <hi>Loury.</hi> On the 17th of October, the party was attacked by the Savages, and totally defeated: The officers, and many of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, were killed: Mr. <hi>Munſon,</hi> being with others miſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was ſuppoſed to be amongſt the ſlain.</p>
            <p>The melancholy tidings of this unhappy affair, were communicated to the family, and other friends, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his untimely end, with all the bitterneſs of grief natural to the circumſtances of his ſuppoſed death.</p>
            <p>But Providence had reſerved him for other ſcenes. Finding no hopes in flight, he had determined to act the part of a ſoldier, and ſell his life as dear as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but being quite ſpent with fatigue, he was ſoon diſarmed by the Savages, and ſtript of all his clothes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſhoes, ſocks, and overalls. They gave him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change an old Indian coat, and the ſecond day an old ſhirt. In this dreſs he was driven five or ſix days; the Indians on horſeback ſtill riding upon his heels, till his ſtrength was almoſt wholly exhauſted, and he more than once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, he could ſtruggle no longer with his fate, but muſt ſeek a refuge in the ſhades of death. On the third day after his capture they painted him, in token of life and pardon. Each night he was faſt bound, and placed between two Savages; ſo that there was no poſſibility of eſcaping from them. They moreover had left the place of action in ſuch haſte, for fear of purſuit, that they could take but very little proviſion; in conſequence of which the priſoners had the additional miſery of hunger to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. There were eleven taken; but one of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy number, being unable to travel at the unmerciful rate the Savages required, was killed: The other ten ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at an Indian town, belonging to the Ottawa tribe.

cuſtom was to let it putrify before they ate it, he could not partake of their repaſt, and to ſtay in their huts at meal time was almoſt intolerable.</p>
            <p>In this wretched ſituation he continued for eight months, compelled to hard labour;—almoſt without clothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the inclemencies of the winter ſeaſon, far remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from all his friends who, ignorant of his fate, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him beyond all the troubles of this life.—His forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, however, did not forſake him;—he revolved in his mind various plans for eſcaping from them: But being a ſtranger to the country thro' which he muſt paſs, ignorant of the courſe he ought to ſteer, and beſet with the jealous vigilance of his enemies, he ſtill found inſurmountable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables before him. Having however by much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance and ſeeming tranquillity, flattered his Maſter into a ſecurity, he came to the determination of taking his gun, and truſting himſelf to fortune: But before he had put this hazardous experiment in execution, he happily met with an Engliſh trader, who ſuggeſted a ſafer method. After receiving from this trader the point of compaſs he ought to obſerve, and other uſeful directions, on the 17th of June he left them in a profound ſleep; and aſſiſted by the light of the moon, which was now riſing, he took his unknown way through the uninhabited wilderneſs, amid the ſolemn ſilence of the night. He travelled till the dawn of day, when he ſecreted himſelf in ſome weeds and graſs, about 15 rods from a kind of road in which he travelled. In this ſituation he ſaw two of his enemies purſuing after him on horſeback. In about an hour and a half they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the ſame way. The next night he purſued his courſe, and arrived at ſome French ſettlement, where the people ſhewed him kindneſs. Having waſhed the paint from his face, and refreſhed himſelf, about day-break he continued his rout, and travelling 26 miles, about 11 o'clock he came to another ſettlement. He had but juſt ſtepped into the houſe, when accidentally looking out at the window, he ſaw twelve Indians croſſing a river within twelve rods of the houſe. The gentleman proved to be friendly, and concealed him in an upper loft for his ſecurity in caſe they had entered: But they purſued the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

later, he muſt inevitably have fallen into their hands,— the fatal conſequences of which are eaſily conceived. Here he ſtayed two days, and the people ſhewed him much kindneſs. The Lady gave him a good ſhirt, and a hat, the firſt which had been on his head in eight months;— they procured him a paſſage by water to Detroit, and gave him a ſufficient quantity of proviſions for the journey. Such are the bleſſed fruits of benevolence!—When he arrived at that fortreſs, Col. <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the commanding officer, was no leſs benevolent: He gave him a plenty of proviſions, and a paſsport;—put him on board of a veſſel in his Majeſty's ſervice, and ſent him to Niagara, where he met with a number of New-England gentlemen, whoſe liberality ſupplied him with neceſſaries to complete his journey. Capt. <hi>Guernſey,</hi> late of Durham, and Mr. <hi>Salmon Goodrich,</hi> of Berlin, were of the number of theſe gentlemen, whoſe kindneſs did honour both to themſelves and their country, and whoſe names Mr. <hi>Munſon</hi> hath frequently mentioned with gratitude.</p>
            <p>Here, after eight months of almoſt inceſſant fatigue of body and mind, he took a ſhort repoſe; and afterwards getting a paſſage by water to Skenectady, on the 21ſt of July he again arrived at his Father's houſe. The joy and ſurpriſe of his Parents, on receiving again that Son to their arms whom they had thought no longer an inhabitant of this world;—whom they had mourned as dead for many ſorrowful months, is much better conceived than expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Munſon's</hi> military career here ended. After ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſhort time with his friends, in Harwinton, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to Middletown, where he gladdened the hearts of his acquaintance, and with whom he conſulted upon the future plans of his life. As the ſeas ſeemed to open the faireſt proſpect for him towards wealth and reſpectability, he applied himſelf to the ſtudy of navigation, and ſoon became maſter of it. His earneſt deſire of perfecting himſelf in the maritime profeſſion, induced him to ſhip on board a veſſel as a raw hand, in an European voyage. The ſeveral duties to which he was called, during the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, were performed with ſo much <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

diſpatch, that in his ſettlement with the owners, on his return, they allowed him Four Dollars a month for extra ſervices. He remained with his friends a ſhort time, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging his affairs for another voyage, which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took for the Weſt-Indies. This voyage proved his laſt: He was captured by the French, and carried into the iſland of St. Croix a priſoner, where he was ſeized with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fever, which in a ſhort time put an end to his labours. He died on the 21ſt of Sept. 1796;—after a toilſome life of 28 years, 6 months, and 18 days,—11 years and four months of which was ſpent in the ſervice of his country.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of his travels, he had contracted an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with many worthy and reſpectable people: As their friendſhip for him was wholly diſintereſted, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual warmth of their affection, affords us the higheſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium upon his character.—"The opportunity I had of knowing him (ſaith one of theſe, <note n="*" place="bottom">Cap<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
