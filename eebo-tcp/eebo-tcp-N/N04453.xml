            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And when the town-clerk had appeaſed the people, he ſaid, Ye men of Epheſus, what man is there that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how that the city of the Epheſians is a worſhipper of the great goddeſs Diana, and of the image which fell down from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter. Seeing then that theſe things cannot be ſpoken againſt, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing raſhly. For ye have brought hither theſe men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blaſphemers of your goddeſs. Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftſmen which are with him, have a matter againſt any man, the law is open, and there are deputies; let them implead one another. But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it ſhall be determined in a lawful aſſembly.

            <opener>
               <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ON <hi>Thurſday</hi> Evening I came hither from the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> Aſſizes, where I have been engaged in a Trial between ſome of thoſe who are call'd <hi>Methodiſts</hi> and ſome violent Rioters. Perhaps this News may a little ſtartle you, and put you upon Enquiry (as it hath done ſome others) <q>How we came to go to Law with our Adverſaries, when it is our <hi>avow'd Principle</hi> to ſuffer patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Truth's Sake?</q> I will tell you, my dear Friend:—Tho' perhaps there is nothing in the World more abuſed than the Law, and there are very few that go to Law out of a proper Principle; yet we hold, that there is a proper Uſe of it, and the Law is good, when uſed lawfully. — Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no we have uſed it lawfully in the preſent Caſe, I ſhall leave my Friend to judge, after I have told him the Motives that induced us to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005518_0003_10184BFF12EE8308"/>
engage in it. — The, <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> you know, are every-where accounted Enthuſiaſts, in the worſt Senſe of the Word; but tho' they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſuch, yet they would not be Enthuſiaſts in Reality. — Now we look upon it to be one Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Enthuſiaſm, to expect to attain an End with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making uſe of <hi>proper Means.</hi>—We alſo think, that Believers ſhould be very careful not to be fond of ſuffering Perſecution, when they may avoid it, by making Application to the High Powers.—We are likewiſe of Opinion, that good Chriſtians will be good Subjects, and conſequently it is their Duty, as much as in them lies, to put a Stop to every thing, in a rightful Way, that may prove deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the King or the Government under which they live.—Chriſtian Miniſters in particular, we think, ought to conſider the Weakneſs of People's Grace, and, in Pity to precious Souls, do what they can to remove every thing out of the Way, that may diſcourage or prevent poor People's hearing the everlaſting Goſpel.—Theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, my dear Friend, for ſome time paſt, have led me to examine whether the <hi>Methodiſts</hi> in general (and I myſelf in particular) have acted the Part of good Subjects and judicious Chriſtian Miniſters, in ſo long neglecting to make an Application to the ſuperior Courts, and putting in Execution the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws of the Land, in order to prevent thoſe many dreadful Outrages which have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt us.—I need not deſcend to particulars.— Our Weekly Hiſtory is full of them; and before
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005518_0004_10184C01F3E5F320"/>
that came out, ſeveral of our Brethren, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> have received much Damage from time to time, and been frequently in great Hazard of their Lives.—<hi>Wiltſhire</hi> has been very remarkable for mobbing and abuſing the <hi>Methodiſts;</hi> and, for about ten Months laſt paſt, it has alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd very much in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Hampton,</hi> where our Friend Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> has a Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Houſe, and has been much bleſs'd to many People. This diſpleas'd the Grand Enemy of Souls, who ſtirr'd up many of the baſer Sort, privately encouraged by ſome of a higher Rank, to come from time to time, in great Numbers, with a Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell and Horn, to beſet the Houſe, and beat and abuſe the People.—About the beginning of <hi>July</hi> laſt their Oppoſition ſeem'd to riſe to the higheſt.— For ſeveral Days they aſſembled in great Bodies, broke the Windows, and mobb'd the People to ſuch a Degree, that many expected to be murder'd, and hid themſelves in Holes and Corners, to avoid the Rage of their Adverſaries. Once, when I was there, they continued from Four in the Afternoon till Midnight rioting, giving loud Huzzas, caſting Dirt upon the Hearers, and making Proclamations, <q>That no Anabaptiſts, Presbyterians <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould preach there, upon Pain of being firſt put into a Skin-pit, and afterwards into a Brook.</q>—At another time they pull'd one or two Women down the Stairs by the Hair of their Heads. And on the 10th of <hi>July</hi> they came to the Number of near a Hundred, in their uſual Way, with a Low-bell and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005518_0005_10184C0703CCE680"/>
Horn, about Five in the Afternoon, forced into Mr. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Houſe, and demanded him down the Stairs whereon he was preaching, took him out of his Houſe, and threw him into a Skin-pit full of noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Things and ſtagnated Water.—One of our Friends, named <hi>Williams,</hi> asking them, if they were not aſham'd to ſerve an innocent Man ſo? They put him into the ſame Pit twice, and afterwards beat him, and dragged him along the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> quietly return'd home, and betook himſelf to Prayer, and exhorted the People to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in ſuffering for the Sake of the Goſpel. In about half an Hour they came to the Houſe again, dragged him down the Stairs, and led him away a Mile and a Half to a Place called <hi>Bourn-brook,</hi> and then threw him in. A Stander-by, fearing he might be drowned, jump'd in and pulled him out; whereupon another of the Rioters immediately puſh'd him into the Pool a ſecond Time, and cut his Leg againſt a Stone, ſo that he went lame for near a fortnight.—Both the Conſtable and Juſtices were applied to, but refuſed to act; and ſeem'd rather to countenance the Mobbing, hoping thereby <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſm</hi> (as they called it) would be put a Stop to, at leaſt at <hi>Hampton.</hi> For a Seaſon they gained their End. — There was no Preaching for ſome Time, the People fearing to aſſemble on Account of the Violence of the Mob.—Upon my Return to Town I adviſed with my Friends what to do.—We knew we wanted to exerciſe no Revenge againſt the Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and yet we thought it wrong that the Goſpel
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005518_0006_10184C09CB562150"/>
ſhould be ſtopped by ſuch Perſons, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which we lived countenanced no ſuch thing; and alſo, that it was abſurd to thank God for wholeſome Laws, if they were not to be made uſe of. We knew very well that an Apoſtle had told us, that Magiſtrates were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Puniſhment of Evil-doers; and that they bear not the Sword in vain. — We were alſo fearful if any of our Brethren ſhould be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by future Riotings (as in all Probability they might) that we ſhould be acceſſary to their Death if we neglected to tie up the Rioters Hands, which was all we deſired to do.—Beſides, we could not look upon this as allowed Perſecution, ſince it was not countenanced by the Laws of the Land, and we might have Redreſs from theſe Rioters and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Magiſtrates by appealing to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whoſe real Friends and loyal Subjects we judged ourſelves not to be, if we ſuffer'd his Laws to be publickly tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under Foot by ſuch notorious Rioting; and which, tho' begun againſt the <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> might ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in open Rebellion againſt King <hi>George.</hi>—For theſe and ſuch like Reaſons, we thought it our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to move for an Information in the <hi>King's bench</hi> againſt five of the Ringleaders, and fixed upon the Riot which they made on <hi>Sunday July</hi> 10. when they put Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> into the Skin-pit and Brook. But before this was done, I wrote a Letter to one whom they called Captain, deſiring him to inform his Aſſociates, <q>That if they would acknowledge their Fault, pay for curing a Boy's
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005518_0007_101812E1C851DE18"/>
Arm, which was broke the Night I was there, and mend the Windows of Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Houſe, we would readily paſs all by; but if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their Reſolutions to riot, we thought it our Duty to prevent their doing, and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving further Damage, by moving for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt them in the <hi>King's-Bench.</hi>
               </q> I alſo ſent a Copy of this Letter to a Miniſter of the Town, and to a Juſtice of the Peace, with a Letter to each from myſelf:—But all in vain.—The Rioters ſent me a moſt inſolent Anſwer, wrote me Word, <q>they were in <hi>high-Spirits,</hi> and were reſolved there ſhould be no more Preaching in <hi>Hampton.</hi>
               </q>— Finding them <hi>irreclaimable,</hi> we moved the next Term for a Rule of Court in the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> to lodge an Information againſt five of the Ring-leaders, for the Outrage committed, Violence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, and Damage done to Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> on <hi>Sunday July</hi> 10.—The Rioters were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of it, appear'd by their Council, and prayed the Rule might be enlarged till the next Term.—It was granted. In the mean while they continued Mobbing, broke into Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Houſe one <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> Night at Eleven o'Clock, when there was no Preaching, made thoſe that were in Bed get up, and ſearched the Oven, Cellar, and every Corner of the Houſe, to ſee whether they could find any <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts.</hi> Some Time after, they threw another young Man into a Mud-pit three Times ſucceſſively, and abuſed the People in a dreadful Manner. The next Term came on.—We proved our Accuſations
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005518_0008_10184C0E59187FE0"/>
by twenty-ſix Affidavits; and the Defendants mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Reply, the Rule was made abſolute, and an Information filed againſt them. — To this they pleaded <hi>NOT GUILTY</hi>; and according to the Method in the Crown-Office, the Cauſe was referred to the Aſſize held at <hi>Glouceſter, March</hi> 3d. — Thither I went, and on <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning laſt the Trial came on. It was given out by ſome, <q>That the <hi>Methodiſts</hi> were to loſe the Cauſe, whether right or wrong.</q> And I believe the Defendants depended much on a Suppoſition that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Jury would be prejudiced againſt us. We were eaſy, knowing that our Saviour had the Hearts of all in his Hands. Being aware of the great Conſequences of gaining or loſing this Trial, both in reſpect to us and the Nation, we kept a Day of Faſting and Prayer thro' all the Societies both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> Our <hi>Scotch</hi> Friends alſo joined with us, and chearfully committed our Cauſe into his Hands by whom Kings reign and Princes decree Juſtice. We had about thirty Witneſſes to prove the Riot and Facts laid down in the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.— Our Council opened the Cauſe (as I heard, being not preſent when the Trial begun) with much Solidity and ſound Reaſoning: They ſhewed, <q>That Rioters were not to be Reformers; and that his Majeſty had no where put the Reins of Government into the Hands of Mobbers, or made them Judge or Jury.</q>—One of them, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, with great Gravity reminded the Gentlemen on the Jury of the Advice of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

of the Law, recorded <hi>Acts</hi> v. 38, 39. <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from theſe Men, and let them alone; for if this Council, or this Work be of Men, it will come to nought: But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, leſt haply ye be found even to fight againſt God.</q> Our Witneſſes were then called.—I came into Court when the ſecond Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was examining.—Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> and four more (three of which <hi>were not called Methodiſts</hi>) ſo clearly proved both the Riot and the Facts laid to the Charge of the Defendants, that the Judge was of Opinion there needed no other Evidence.—The Council for the Defendants then roſe, and exerted a good deal of Oratory, and I think ſaid all that could well be ſaid, to make the beſt of a bad Matter. One urged, <q>That we were Enthuſiaſts, and our Principles and Practices had ſuch a Tendency to infect and hurt the People, that it was right, in his Opinion, for any private Perſon to ſtand up and put a Stop to us; and whoever did ſo was a Friend to his Country.</q>—He ſtrove to influence the Jury by telling them, <q>That if a Verdict was given againſt the Defendants, it wou'd coſt them Two Hundred Pounds:—That the Defendants Rioting was not premeditated; but that coming to hear Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> and being offended at his Doctrine, a ſudden Quarrel aroſe, and thereby the unhappy Men were led into the preſent Fray, which he could have wiſh'd had not happen'd; but however, it did not amount to a <hi>Riot,</hi> but only <hi>an Aſſault.</hi>

the Jury, <q>That they would undertake to prove that the <hi>Methodiſts</hi> began the Tumult firſt.</q>— He was pleaſed alſo to mention me by Name, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Court, <q>That Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> had been travelling from Common to Common, making the People cry, and then picking their Pockets, under Pretence of collecting Money for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of <hi>Georgia;</hi> and knowing that <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> was a populous Country, he at laſt came there. —That he had now ſeveral Curates, of which Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> was one, who in his Preaching had found Fault with the Proceedings of the Clergy, and ſaid if the People went to hear them, they would be damned.—He added, that there had lately been ſuch Mobbing in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> that a Regiment of Soldiers was ſent down to ſuppreſs them; inſinuating that the <hi>Methodiſts</hi> were the Authors—That we had now another Cauſe of a like Nature depending in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and that we were not of that mild, pacifick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as we wou'd pretend to be.</q> — This, and much more to the ſame Purpoſe, though foreign to the Matter in hand, pleaſed many of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who expreſſed their Satisfaction in hearing the <hi>Methodiſts</hi> in general, and me in particular, thus laſhed, by frequent laughing.—The Eyes of all were upon me —Our Saviour kept me quite eaſy. —I thought of that verſe of <hi>Horace,</hi>

               <hi>Tertullus</hi>'s accuſing <hi>Paul</hi> came alſo to my Mind, and I look'd upon myſelf as highly honoured in having ſuch Things ſpoken againſt me falſly for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s great Name's Sake.—To prove what the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's Council had inſinuated, they called up a young Man, who was own Brother to one of the Defendants, and one of the Mob.—He ſwore point blank, <q>That Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> ſaid, if People went to Church they wou'd be damned; and if they would come to him, he wou'd carry them to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi>—He ſwore alſo that the Pool in which Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> was thrown, was no deeper than half way up his Legs. He ſaid firſt that there were but about ten of them that came to the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>; and then he ſwore that there were about threeſcore.—He ſaid there was a Low-Bell, and that one of the Defendants did ask Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> to come down off the Stairs, but that none of them went up to him, upon which Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> willingly obey'd, went with them briskly along the Street, and, as he wou'd have repreſented it, put himſelf into the Skin-pit and Pool, and ſo came out again.</q> He ſaid alſo ſome other things, but thro' his whole Evidence appeared ſo flagrantly falſe, that one of the Council ſaid, <q>It was enough to make his Hair ſtand an end.</q> The Judge himſelf wiſh'd, <q>He he had ſo much Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as to fear an Oath.</q>—So he went down in Diſgrace. Their Second Evidence was an aged Woman, Mother to one of the Defendants.—She ſwore, <q>That her Son did go up the Stairs by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005518_0012_10184C1AA08F6360"/>
Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> tore her Son's Coat, and would have broke his Neck down Stairs.</q> But ſhe talk'd ſo <hi>faſt,</hi> and her Evidence was ſo palpably <hi>falſe,</hi> that ſhe was ſent away in as much Diſgrace as the other. Their third and laſt Evidence was Father to one who was in the Mob, tho' not one of the Defendants. The chief he had to ſay was, <q>That when Mr. <hi>Adams</hi> was coming from the Pool, one met him, and ſaid, Brother, how do you do? Upon which he anſwered, that he had received no Damage, but had been in the Pool and came out again.</q> So that all their Evidences, however contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to another, yet corroborated ours, and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Riot out of their own Mouths. The Book was then given to a Juſtice of the Peace, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken up Mr. <hi>Cennick,</hi> for preaching near <hi>Stroud,</hi> and had lately given many ſignal Proofs thas he was no Friend to the <hi>Methodiſts.</hi>—But he intending to ſpeak only about their Characters, and the Council and Judge looking upon that as quite impertinent to the Matter in hand, he was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as an Evidence. — Upon this, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, with great Candor and Impartiality, ſum'd up the Evidence, and told the Jury, <q>That he thought they ſhould bring <hi>all</hi> the Defendants <hi>in Guilty</hi>; for our Evidences had ſufficiently proved the Whole of the Information, and alſo, that the Riot was premeditated. — He ſaid, That, in his Opinion, the chief of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant's Evidence was <hi>incredible;</hi> and that, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the <hi>Methodiſts</hi> were <hi>Heterodox,</hi> (as perhaps
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005518_0013_10184C1C265074D8"/>
they might be) it belong'd to the Eccleſiaſtical Government to call them to an Account; that they were Subjects, and Rioters were not to be their Reformers."</q>—He alſo reminded them of <q>the dreadful ill Conſequences of Rioting at <hi>any Time,</hi> much more at ſuch a critical Time as this; that Rioting was the Fore-runner of, and might end in Rebellion; that it was Felony, without Benefit of Clergy, to pull down a <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe</hi>; and, for all as he knew, it was <hi>High Treaſon</hi> to pull down even a Bawdy houſe.—That this Information came from the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> that his Majeſty's Juſtices there thought they had had ſufficient Reaſon to grant it; that the Matters contain'd in it had been evidently prov'd before them, and conſequently they ſhould bring all the Defendants in <hi>Guilty.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this the Jury were deſir'd to conſider of their Verdict. There ſeem'd to be ſome little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur amongſt them. His Lordſhip perceiving it, inform'd them, <q>They had nothing to do with the <hi>Damages,</hi> (that was to be referr'd to the <hi>King's Bench</hi>) they were only to conſider whether the Defendants were <hi>guilty or not.</hi>
               </q> Whereupon, in a few Minutes, they gave a Verdict for the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and brought in <hi>all</hi> the Defendants <hi>guilty of the whole Information lodg'd againſt them.</hi> — I then retired to my Lodgings, kneel'd down, and gave Thanks, with ſome Friends, to our all-conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Emanuel.</hi>—Afterwards I went to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

them to behave with Meekneſs and Humility to their Adverſaries, and after they had taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Refreſhment ſent them home rejoicing.—In the Evening I preach'd on thoſe Words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>By this I know that thou favoureſt me, ſince thou haſt not ſuffer'd mine Enemy to triumph over me.</hi> — God was pleaſed to enlarge my Heart much.—I was very happy with my Friends afterwards, and the next Morning ſet out for <hi>London,</hi> where we have had a bleſſed thankſgiving Seaſon, and from whence I take the firſt Opportunity of ſending you as many Particulars of the OCCASION, PROCESS, and ISSUE of our TRIAL, as I can well recollect. What Report his Lordſhip will be pleaſed to make of the Caſe, and how the Defendants will be dealt with cannot be known till next Term; when I know, I ſhall apprize you of it, as alſo of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards them. —In the mean while let me entreat you to give Thanks to the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> in our Behalf, and to pray that his Word may have free Courſe, may run, and be glorified, and a Stop be put to all ſuch rebellious Proceedings.</p>
