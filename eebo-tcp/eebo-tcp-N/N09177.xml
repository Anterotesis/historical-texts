            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I ESTEEM myſelf highly honoured,<note place="margin">Introduction</note> when you requeſt of me, a full account of the riſe, progreſs, and preſent ſtate, of the military operations in North-America; with a juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of the characters of the principal agents in our political affairs. Indeed, my Lord, you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a taſk that will require a Volume, rather than a Letter. As your Lordſhip's deſire, however, ſhall always carry with me the force of a command, I will engage in it with the utmoſt chearfulneſs. Forgive me, my Lord, for ſaying I have a ſtill ſtronger motive for compoſing theſe ſheets, than a mere compliance with your Lordſhip's requeſt; to which I would ever pay the profoundeſt regard. When I reflect upon your eminent ſtation—your
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011701_0004_0F87EB77DE35A868"/>
excelling abilities—your warm and active zeal, for the intereſt and welfare of the Britiſh colonies; I am prompted by an unfeigned deſire of ſerving my country; and ſetting before your Lordſhip's eyes TRUTH, in her plain undiſguiſed habiliments: I would ſtrip her of all that deluſive colouring, with which ſhe hath been artfully varniſhed, by letter-writers from this part of the world; either to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome mean ſiniſter party deſign, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the views of ſome aſpiring and ambitious minds. Candour and integrity ſhall therefore guide my pen; and amidſt the variety with which it is my purpoſe to preſent your Lordſhip, it ſhall be my ſacred endeavour, to the beſt of my knowledge, to attach myſelf to the ſtricteſt—the moſt impartial verity.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">American colonies too long neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, tho' of general im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</note>THE American colonies, I ſpeak it with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, my Lord, were too long neglected by their mother country; tho' loudly demanding her patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and aſſiſtance. Thoſe, on the continent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire her peculiar notice: They may be made an inexhauſtible magazine of wealth; and if ſuffered to fall into the hands of the French, ſuch will be the acceſſion to their already extended commerce and marine ſtrength, that Great Britain muſt not only loſe her former luſtre, but, dreadful even in thought! ceaſe to be any longer an independent

power. Nay, ſhould every other ſcheme fail, the ſucceſs of this will inevitably accompliſh the long-projected deſign of that aſpiring nation, for ſetting up an Univerſal Monarchy: for, if France rule the ocean, her reſources will enable her to ſubject all Europe to her deſpotic ſway. But it is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to offer any arguments in ſupport of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, of which the public ſeems to remain no longer inſenſible. Happy for us, had theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prevailed earlier, and been more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inculcated!</p>
            <p>THE importance of the colonies, my Lord,<note place="margin">More conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, on the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Louiſbourg,</note> was too little conſidered, till the commencement of the laſt war. The reduction of Cape Breton by the people of New-England, was an acquiſition ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected and fortunate, that America became, on that remarkable event, a more general topic of converſation. Mr. Shirley, the governor of the Maſſachuſetts Bay, was the principal projector of that glorious enterprize: An enterprize, which reduced to the obedience of his Britanic Majeſty, the DUNKIRK of North-America. Of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the French, was the poſſeſſion of that important key to their American ſettlements, that its reſtitution was, in reality, the purchaſe of the laſt general Peace in Europe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011701_0005_0F87EB789E30F930"/>
               <note place="margin">Character of Gov. Shirley</note>OF all our plantation Governors, my Lord, Mr. Shirley is moſt diſtinguiſhed for his ſingular abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He was born in England, and bred up to the Law, at one of the Inns of Court. In that profeſſion he afterwards practiſed, for ſeveral years in the Maſſachuſetts Bay: and, in 1741, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by his Majeſty to the ſupreme command of that colony. He is a Gentleman of great political ſagacity, deep penetration, and indefatigable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. With reſpect to the wiſdom and equity of his adminiſtration, he can boaſt the univerſal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of a wiſe, free, jealous, and moral people. Though not bred to arms, he is eminently poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of theſe important military virtues—An extent of capacity to form and execute great deſigns; — profound ſecrecy; — love of regularity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; — a frugal and laborious manner of living; with the art of conciliating the affections; — a talent which Hannibal admired in Pyrrhus, above all the reſt of his martial accompliſhments. In the firſt of theſe great qualities, Mr. Shirley is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged to ſhine: and it is, in reality, more eſtimable, than all other military endowments without it; conſiſting, to uſe the words of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning hiſtorian Mr. Rollin, <q>in having great views; in forming plans at a diſtance; in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a deſign, from which the author never
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011701_0005_0F87EB789E30F930"/>
departs; in concerting all the meaſures neceſſary for its ſucceſs; in knowing how to ſeize the favourable moments of occaſion, which are rapid in their courſe, and never return; to make even ſudden and unforeſeen accidents ſubſervient to a plan; in a word, to be upon the watch againſt every thing, without being perplexed and diſconcerted by any event.</q> But, whether it ariſes from his being ſo far advanced in years, or from his conſtitutional diſpoſition and make, he has not, in my opinion, that activity and alertneſs ſo conducive to warlike expedition; and on which the ſucceſs of an enterprize frequently depends. This was one of the characteriſtics of Braddock; a commander, vigorous in executing, as Mr. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, judicious in contriving a plan — <hi>ſed non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia poſſumus omnes</hi> — and 'tis eaſier, my Lord, to find active hands, than able heads.<note place="margin">His atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony affairs.</note> No man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the nation, has beſtowed more attention, upon the ſtate of the colonies in general: and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their intereſt ſincerely at heart, he has been perpetually concerting expedients, advancive of their proſperity, and to check the views of an all-graſping Monarch. Upon the reduction of Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, he earneſtly recommended to his Majeſty's miniſters, the demolition of that fortreſs, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt the French ſettlements in Canada.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011701_0006_0F87EB795E31DFA8"/>
The reaſons why he ſucceeded in neither of theſe propoſals, I cannot take upon me to aſſign. His Majeſty,<note place="margin">Is rewarded with a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Amidſt all the ſplendors and delicacies of Verſailles, he forgot neither OUR intereſt, nor HIS duty. As a proof of his integrity and diligence, during that fruitleſs embaſſy, one need only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe theſe judicious and laborious memorials, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Majeſty's right to Nova Scotia, which were principally framed by him; and lately pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by order of the Lords of trade, as a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit of our title to that part of America. When no ſatisfaction could, in this way, be obtained from the Court of France; which was artfully endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpin out the negociation, and at the ſame time fortifying the places in queſtion, as well as making new acquiſitions; the Britiſh commiſſaries retired from the French Court, and Mr. Shirley reſumed his government in New England in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 1753.</p>

To eſtabliſh ſuch an undue power, and amazing influence, would, in a Grecian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, have expoſed a man of leſs ambition and better principles to the oſtraciſm. Mr. Clark being ſuperſeded by Governor Clinton <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Clinton arrived as Governor, 22 Sept. 1743.</note>, Mr. De Lancey was preſented with a freſh opportunity for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of his political genius. Mr. Clinton, a gentleman of but indifferent parts, wholly reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf into his hands. Contenting himſelf with the title and ſalary of Governor, he left the ſole direction of affairs to his miniſter, who, by virtue of his late acquired omnipotence with the aſſembly, carried all his points, and even endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the people. This intimacy ſubſiſted no longer than it was found conducive to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Having obtained from Mr. Clinton a new commiſſion for his office of chief Juſtice <hi>during good behaviour;</hi> and flattering himſelf with the hopes of another, appointing him Lieut. Governor, through the intereſt of his friends in England, he cared not how ſoon his excellency abdicated the province, nor how tempeſtuous he rendered his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; and was therefore prepared for an open rupture. He no ſooner thought himſelf cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011701_0014_0F87EB7F5E2740E8"/>
of acting independently of the Governor, than, like Sixtus Quintus, who threw aſide his crutches the moment of his exaltation to the popedom, he put off all that humble devotion, by which he had ſo fatally deceived his too credulous maſter, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet himſelf at defiance againſt him. Now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dictate, rather than adviſe: and inſtead of Sejanus, choſe to be Tiberius himſelf. Dining one day with Mr. Clinton, and inſiſting upon ſome favourite point with great imperiouſneſs, the Governor, who had hitherto very cordially ſuffered himſelf to be led, refuſed on this occaſion to be driven. The Chief Juſtice then aroſe and left him; declaring, with an oath, he would make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration uneaſy for the futute: His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy replied, he might do his worſt. Thus they parted; nor were ever afterwards reconciled. This breach gave riſe to the contentions, which ſo unhappily imbroiled our provincial affairs, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the remainder of his adminiſtration. The aſſembly were inſtantly inflamed. He who before had been able to make them connive at very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable ſteps, could at once ſtir up an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the moſt unexceptionable meaſures. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, warm and virulent, were now drawn up; unworthy their own dignity to offer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with the groſſeſt language to his Majeſty's
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011701_0014_0F87EB7F5E2740E8"/>
repreſentative. Thus was formed againſt Mr. Clinton a powerful party, which ceaſed not, while he continued at the helm, to harraſs and perplex him. To ſuch an exhorbitant length did they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their oppoſition, as to throw off the reſtraint of humanity; They had even recourſe to force and violence. Nay, a partiſan of the Chief Juſtice, in defiance of the ſacred rights of the magiſtracy and the law — to ſhew his reſentment againſt Mr. Clinton and his adherents — aſſaulted the mayor; whipped the ſheriff; damned the Governor; and ſtabbed his phyſician. My Lord, we became the ſport and contempt of our neighbours; and it is beyond contradiction, that Mr. De Lancey, by blowing up the coals of contention, did the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince more injury, then he will ever be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Nor is there any reaſon to doubt, that the enormous power of this gentleman, and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment raiſed againſt Mr. Clinton, occaſioned the 39th article of the king's inſtructions to Sir Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Oſborn; which appears purpoſely calculated to render our future Governors independent on his influence over the aſſembly: For a law indefinite, making proviſion for the ſalary allowed by the King to his Governors; and competent ſalaries to all judges, juſtices, and other neceſſary officers and miniſters of government — ſuch a law, I ſay,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011701_0015_0F87EB801E232DF0"/>
would effectually render a Governor independent, of the aſſembly, and conſequently of any undue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in it. Nor without ſuch independence, or an abridgement of Mr. De Lancey's power, by reducing him to his primitive private ſtation, do I ſee any probability of the extinction of that party-ſpirit, which hath ſo long diſturbed the tranquility, and injured the public weal of the colony. Mr. Clinton, being ſupperſeded by Sir Danvers Oſborn, <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Danvers Oſborn arrived at New-York, the 7th of October, 1753.</note> a gentleman of a moſt amiable moral character, retired into the country; from whence he propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to embark for Great-Britain. The Chief Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, notwithſtanding his long declared enmity, and unwearied induſtry to embarraſs his adminiſtration, had now — the humility, ſhall I call it? — to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch a meſſenger to him, with deſign if poſſible to procure an accommodation — in order to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his favour in England, when he could no longer diſtreſs him in America, It were difficult to determine, whether this required a higher degree of aſſurance or ſervility. But it is no uncommon thing, to behold the ſame perſon faſtidious and fawning, ſupercilious and ſycophantic.

As Chief juſtice, great is his intereſt in the counties: with that intereſt he commands elections: with his ſway in elections he rules the aſſembly: and with his ſovereignty over the houſe controuls a governor. His influence with the members of the aſſembly being the main ſource of his exorbitant power, never will he ſerve the Crown at the riſque of a diſſention with the houſe.

Nay, my Lord, I will venture to affirm— and every man in the province muſt bear me teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony — that while his influence continues to be ſupported with his office of chief juſtice, no opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which this colony is concerned, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſucceſs, ſhould this monopolizer of power be determined to obſtruct it.</p>

The queſtion can only come from a novice in hiſtory, and a ſtranger to mankind. In the judgement of your your Lordſhip, who is deeply read in both, I am confident that popularity is no indication of merit.

The ſame people who could without emotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Sidney bleeding in defence of public liberty, could commit a riot in reſcuing a Sacheverel for preaching ſedition, and ſubverting the nation. Your Lordſhip remembers that Maſſanello, in the ſhort ſpace of ten days, was a poor fiſherman, — a popular incendiary, — a ſovereign viceroy, — ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of his honours,—treated like a malefactor, — knocked on the head, — and thrown into a ditch.

Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable were the difficulties he had to ſurmount, in a country rugged, pathleſs, and unknown, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the Allegheny mountains, thro' unfrequented woods, and dangerous defiles. From the little meadows the army proceeded in two diviſions.

The ſecond, with the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011701_0025_0F87EB879E2573F8"/>
ſtores, and heavy baggage, was led by Col. Dunbar. Never was man more confident of ſucceſs, than this brave, tho' unfortunate officer. Being adviſed at the great meadows, that that the enemy expected a reinforcement of 500 regular troops, he puſhed on by forced marches, with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, that he fatigued the ſoldiers, weakened his horſes, and left his ſecond diviſion near 40 miles in the rear, the enemy being not more than 200 ſtrong at their fort on the Ohio, gave no obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the march of our forces, till the memorable 9th of July — a day never to be forgotten in the annals of North America. About noon our troops paſſed the Monagahela, and were then within ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miles of Fort Du Queſne. — Unapprehenſive of the approach of an enemy, at once was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm given, by a quick and heavy fire upon the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, under Lieut. Col. Gage. Immediately the main body, in good order and high ſpirits, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuſtain them. Orders were then given to halt, and form into battalia. At this juncture the van falling back upon them, in great confuſion, a general panic ſeized the whole body of the ſoldiery; and all attempts to rally them proved utterly inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. The general and all the officers exerted their utmoſt activity, to recover them from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſurprize and diſorder: but equally deaf were
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011701_0025_0F87EB879E2573F8"/>
they to intreaties and commands. During this ſcene of confuſion, they expended their ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the wildeſt and moſt unmeaning fire. Some diſcharging their pieces on our own parties, who were advanced from the main body for the recovery of the cannon. After three hours ſpent in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy ſituation, enduring a terrible ſlaughter, from (it may be ſaid) an <hi>inviſible</hi> foe, orders were given to ſound a retreat, that the men might be brought to cover the waggons. Theſe they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded but a ſhort ſpace of time: for the enemy's fire being again warmly renewed from the front and left flank, the whole army took to immediate flight; leaving behind them all the artillery, proviſions, ammunition, baggage, military cheſt, together with the general's cabinet, containing his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and other papers of conſequence. So great was the conſternation of the ſoldiers, that it was impoſſible to ſtop their career, flying with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt precipitation three miles from the field of action; where only one hundred began to make a more orderly retreat.</p>
            <p>WHAT was the ſtrength of the enemy, has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remained to us uncertain. According to Indian accounts, they exceeded not 400, chiefly Indians: and whether any were ſlain, is ſtill to be doubted, for few were ſeen by our men, being covered by
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011701_0026_0F87EB885E176E20"/>
ſtumps and fallen trees. Great indeed was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction on our ſide. — Numbers of officers ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their lives thro' ſingular bravery. Extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unfortunate was the whole ſtaff. The general, after having five horſes ſhot under him, received a wound in his lungs thro' his right arm, of which he died in four days. His ſecretary, eldeſt ſon of Major General Shirley, a gentleman of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, by a ſhot thro' the head, was killed upon the ſpot. Mr. Orme and Capt.

But, my Lord, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cenſurable the conduct of the ſoldiery may be thought, Mr. Braddock, too ſanguine in his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, was generally blamed for neglecting to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the friendſhip of the Indians, who offered their aſſiſtance; and who, it is certain, had a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them preceded the army, would have ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably diſcovered the enemy's ambuſcade. The Virginian rangers alſo, inſtead of being made to ſerve as regulars in the ranks with the Engliſh troops, ſhould have been employed as out-ſcouts.

               <note place="margin">Major Gen. Shirley aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the command.</note>ON Mr. Braddock's unhappy cataſtrophe, the command of his Majeſty's forces in North America devolved upon Major General Shirley. I before acquainted your Lordſhip of his return to New York, and departure from thence to Albany, where he arrived the beginning of July.</p>
            <p>ALBANY, my Lord, was the grand theatre of all the preparations for the northern expedition againſt Fort St. Frederic, as well as that to the weſtward for the reduction of Niagara. The general, on his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival there, found not the former in the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had reaſon to expect. The provincials diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with the inactivity of a long encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Major General Lyman was obliged to make ſhort marches to prevent their diſbanding; and the general was therefore detained a while in that city,<note place="margin">Is detained at Albany.</note>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:011701_0027_0F87EB891E1D7CE8"/>
to hinder ſo fatal an event. His own troops in the mean time were filing off, in different diviſions, from Schenectady towards Oſwego.</p>
            <p>OSWEGO, along the accuſtomed route,<note place="margin">Route to Oſwego.</note> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be about 300 miles weſt from Albany. The firſt ſixteen, to the village of Schenectady, is land carriage, in a good waggon road. From thence to the Little Falls, in the Mohawk River, at ſixty-five miles diſtance, the battoes <note n="*" place="bottom">A battoe is a light flat-bottomed boat, wideſt in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and at each end ſharp pointed, of about 1500 weight bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and managed by two men, with paddles and ſetting-poles.</note> are ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a rapid ſtream; which too, in dry ſeaſons, is ſo ſhallow, that the men are frequently obliged to turn out, and draw their craft over the rifts with inconceivable labour. At the Little Falls, the portage exceeds not a mile: the ground being marſhy will admit of no wheel carriage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Germans who reſide here, tranſport the battoes in ſleds, which they keep for that purpoſe. The ſame conveyance is uſed at the Great Carrying-Place, ſixty miles beyond the Little Falls; all the way to which the current is ſtill adverſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſwift. The portage here is longer or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, according to the dryneſs or wetneſs of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. In the laſt ſummer months, when rains are not frequent, it is uſually ſix or eight miles acroſs. Taking water again, we enter a narrow rivulet,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011701_0028_0F87EB89DEFAC170"/>
called the Wood-creek, which leads into the One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ida Lake, diſtant forty miles. This ſtream, tho' favourable, being ſhallow, and its banks covered with thick woods, was at this time much obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with old logs and fallen trees. The Oneida Lake ſtretches from eaſt to weſt about thirty miles, and in calm weather is paſſed with great facility. At its weſtern extremity opens the Onondaga River, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to Oſwego, ſituated at its entrance on the ſouth ſide of the Lake Ontario. Extremely difficult and hazardous is the paſſage thro' this riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as it abounds with rifts and rocks; and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent flowing with ſurpriſing rapidity. The principal obſtruction is twelve miles ſhort of Oſwego, and is a fall of about eleven feet perpendicular. The portage here is by land, not exceeding forty yards, before they launch for the laſt time.</p>
            <p>YOUR LORDSHIP, from this account, will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive, that thro' ſuch a long amphibious march an army muſt proceed with prodigious riſque and fatigue; and the battoes be neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by perſons ſkilled in the navagation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to hardſhips. For this ſervice General Shirley had engagad all the young men in the county of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, who formerly had been employed in the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an trade at Oſwego: and a vaſt number of battoes were prepared for the conveyance of the troops, ſtores, and proviſions.</p>

               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:011701_0028_0F87EB89DEFAC170"/>OSWEGO was formerly garriſoned by twenty-five men; but on the commencement of our preſent diſputes, the number was augmented to fifty. Early this ſpring fifty more were ordered up: and about the larter end of May, Capt. Bradſtreet arrived there with 200, beſides workmen to be employed in the naval preparations, purſuant to the ſcheme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed in the congreſs of commiſſioners at Albany the laſt ſummer.</p>
            <p>COL. SCHUYLER'S New Jerſey regiment embarked in two diviſions from Schenectady,<note place="margin">Troops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to that garriſon.</note> the beginning of July. Shirley's and Pepperrell's were preparing to follow, when the melancholy news of Gen. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's defeat reached that place. This ſtruck a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral damp on the ſpirits of the ſoldiers, and many deſerted. Great numbers of the battoe-men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed themſelves into the country, and fled to their reſpective habitations. To engage the return of above half the fugitives, equally ineffectual were threats or promiſes, rewards or puniſhments. The general, however, ſenſible of the importance of the ſervice, purſued his march in ſpite of every vexatious diſappointment. As he paſſed their country, he called upon the Indians of the Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at ſome of their caſtles;<note place="margin">Six Nations averſe to the Niagara ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and why.</note> and ſent ambaſſadors to the reſt, preſſing them to join him, with aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of his protection.

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011701_0029_0F87EB8A9E171C18"/>
greatly diſinclind to our weſtern operations. Indian affairs had been too long neglected by the province of New York, to which the principal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them has always been committed. Neither the ſums allotted for preſents to thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, were always by our governors fairly expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor the preſents themſelves honeſtly diſtributed. And partly thro' repeated frauds, and the omiſſion of proper meaſures to conciliate their favour, our intereſt with them amounted to little more than a bare neutrality.<note place="margin">Johnſon holds a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with them.</note> Mr. Johnſon nevertheleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a mighty influence over them, was intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 5000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, in order to engage their aſſiſtance for the general benefit of his Majeſty's ſervice.

            <p>YOUR LORDSHIP is pleaſed to inſiſt upon my <q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into a detail of every tranſaction, how minute ſoever, that can give any light into the more ſecret ſprings of our political action.<note place="margin">Anecdote of Johnſon and Shirley.</note>
               </q> I ſhall therefore acquaint your Lordſhip, that upon the general's arrival at Albany, Mr. Johnſon laid before him a copy of the minutes of his late treaty with the Indians. Theſe minutes, it ſeems, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011701_0029_0F87EB8A9E171C18"/>
ſome unhandſom reflections upon his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; inſinuating, that to treat ſeparately with them, he had employed one Lydius, a perſon of not the moſt unexceptionable character, either for loyalty or integrity. The ſingle reaſon upon which the ſurmiſe could be founded was this. Lydius, who formerly lived near Lake George, and whoſe Indian acquaintance was very extenſive, had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the general his aſſiſtance, in procuring the junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a number of them, on the deſigned expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Upon which he wrote to Mr. Johnſon, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the pleaſure it would give him, if he could make any uſe of this man in his Majeſty's ſervice. On delivering thoſe minutes into the general's hands, Johnſon, ſenſible of the inſinuation, told him, he intirely diſapproved the reflection they ſeemed to contain, and appeared aſhamed of its inſertion. Having peruſed the paper, Shirley could not avoid complaining of the ill uſage, while the other with ſolemn vows proteſted, he was not privy to it, and importuned him to return the minutes, that he might eraſe the obnoxious paſſage. The former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in the ſincerity of his proteſtations, but ſoon after had abundant reaſon to diſtruſt his integrity.</p>
            <p>THE general had applied to one Staats, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided near Albany, and had a conſiderable intereſt
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011701_0030_0F87EB8B5E1562B0"/>
with the Indians of Stockbridge<note n="*" place="bottom">Stockbridge, by the Indians called Houſatonuc, lies upon the weſtern confines of the Maſſachuſetts Bay, in the eaſtern parts of the province of New York.</note>. He propoſed to him his raiſing a company of them, as a guard to the battoes in their paſſage to Oſwego. Privately was this man intimidated from the undertaking: and Mr. Johnſon, to induce him to break thro' his promiſes, offered him a captain's commiſſion, could he engage an Indian company to proceed on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition under his own direction.</p>
            <p>YOUR LORDSHIP, being already informed of this gentleman's appointment to the command of the provincial army, by the intereſt of General Shirley, will ſcarce have patience at the recital of a conduct ſo aſtoniſhing and ungrateful. The ſecret, my Lord,<note place="margin">Faction formed againſt the general, and occaſion of it.</note> was this. — Mr. Johnſon was never diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for his ſenſe or penetration. He had now for his aid-de-camp Capt. Wraxal, a man of art and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, who a few years before had been appointed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary for Indian affairs, and clerk of the city and county of Albany. Governor Clinton had granted a commiſſion for the latter of thoſe offices, before the date of Wraxal's ſign manual. A ſuit was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commenced, and is ſtill depending between him, and the perſon in poſſeſſion of the office, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended on the determination of a point of law. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account Wraxal became a humble depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011701_0030_0F87EB8B5E1562B0"/>
on Lieut. Governor De Lancey, before whom, unleſs ſuperſeded in the chief command, the caſe muſt be determined upon a writ of error: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had been a declared enemy to Johnſon, throughout the whole of Clinton's adminiſtration, and had even prevented the aſſembly from diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very equitable demand he had againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince for ſervices and diſburſements, now determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fall in with, and ſet him up, in competition with Shirley. Wraxal's poſt and dependence afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fine opportunity for the purpoſe: and ſo John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon became ſtrongly attached to the Lieut. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.<note place="margin">Evil effects of it.</note> Your Lordſhip will no longer wonder at his procuring all the Indians he could prevail upon, to join the provincial troops under his own command; or at his attempts to excite others to embarraſs and obſtruct the general's deſigns upon the Lake On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario. In ſupport of a charge ſo heavy as this, I think it incumbent upon me to aſſign the following inſtances: 1. Not an Indian joined General Shirley at Schenectady, agreeably to Mr Johnſon's poſitive aſſurances. 2. Nor at either of the caſtles in the five cantons, as he paſſed thro' them to Oſwego: but, on the contrary; 3. One Bant, an Onondaga (three of whoſe ſons were in Johnſon's army) at the head of ſeveral other Indians, declared to Mr. Shirley at Oſwego, that it was a place of trade and
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011701_0031_0F87EB8C1E462328"/>
peace — that there ſhould be no war there — and that he ſhould not diſturb the French; adding, that he was going with the like meſſage to Canada. The general having convinced him, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the French from their encroachments muſt redound to the advantage of the Six Nations; he aſſerted, that Mr. Johnſon had ſent them upon this embaſſy to Canada. Tho' this appeared ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incredible, 'tis nevertheleſs certain, 4, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Indians arrived from the Onondaga caſtle, with a belt, declaring it to have been ſent them by Mr. Johnſon, with his requeſt, that not man of them would join the King's troops, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of General Shirley. 5. Others alſo, from the Seneca, Oneida, and Cayuga cantons concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the like reports; particularly one Redhead, an Indian of great fame, and a ſpeaker at the late congreſs at Mount-Johnſon, came to Oſwego, in his way to Oſwagatic or la Gallette, and deſired the ceſſation of all military deſigns; affirming, that with the ſame requeſt he was going to the French.</p>
            <p>IT was with difficulty, my Lord, theſe Indians were reconciled to our attempts, detained at Oſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, and thereby prevented from communicating our operations to the enemy. The general, from theſe inſtance, became more and more ſuſpicious, that the faction at New York were endeavouring to
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011701_0031_0F87EB8C1E462328"/>
embarraſs and impede his meaſures. What farther confirmed his ſuſpicions, that the Lieut. Governor of New York, with that view, made Mr. Johnſon his inſtrument, was a letter, which after his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at Oſwego he received from the latter, wherein he juſtified that very aſperſion before diſavowed, contained in the minutes above recounted.</p>
            <p>MY LORD, we will now leave Mr. Shirley at Oſwego; and purſue the courſe of tranſactions, as well at New York, as in the ſouthern colonies.<note place="margin">Dunbar marches to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note>
            </p>
            <p>DUNBAR, having reached Fort Cumberland, diſpatched an Indian expreſs to General Shirley, with an account of the defeat, and the neceſſary returns reſpecting the troops under his command; acquainting him, moreover, with his intention of marching to Philadelphia, and his hopes of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his orders at Shippenſburgh. About the ſame time Mr. Dinwiddie wrote to Dunbar, propoſing a ſecond attempt on Fort Du Queſne. But a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil being thereupon held, the Members of which were Col. Dunbar, Lieut. Col. Gage, Governor Sharp, Major Chapman, Major Spark, and Sir John St. Clair, it was unanimouſly conceived, that Mr. Dinwiddie's ſcheme was impracticable. The very next day, being the ſecond of Auguſt, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar began his march towards Philadelphia, with 1600 men, four ſix-pounders, and as many cohorns;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011701_0032_0F87EB8CDE250A80"/>
leaving behind him the Virginia and Maryland com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and about 400 wounded. At this ſudden departure of the forces,<note place="margin">Frontiers of Virginia left expoſed.</note> the Virginians were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trmely diſobliged, as not only expoſing their fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and occaſioning the daily deſertion of their provincials; but becauſe the enemy, in flying par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, penetrated into the province, and on many of the inhabitants committed robberies and murder. What judgment ought to be formed of this retreat, I leave your Lordſhip to determine. Certainly thoſe ſouthern colonies ought to have ſtrengthend General Braddock with a large body of provincial forces,<note place="margin">Another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on Fort Du Queſne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> which had doubtleſs prevented all that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of blood and treaſure — the fatal conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of their ill-judged parſimony!

The bill was actually paſſed the houſe for that purpoſe; and the council had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to conceal from their knowledge, the contents of a ſecond letter from Gen. Shirley to Col.

<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011701_0033_0F87EB8D9E0D38D8"/>
depended his credit with the miniſtry; and that with the expiration of his power to carry certain points of prerogative, would alſo expire their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his importance. His agents in England, to ſupport their patron, had hitherto amuſed a certain noble Lord with many ſpecious promiſes.

without leave of the board, bolts into the chamber, and modeſtly interpoſes his advice, to ſend a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to Sir Charles, requeſting his continuance in the ſhip, till the next morning.

The next day, the governor publiſhed his commiſſion; and was, by Mr. De Lancey, invited to a public entertainment. In the evening they conducted him to the common, to hear the acclamations of the people; and on every occaſion, followed him with ſervile court and adulation. To impreſs a high ſenſe of his predeceſſor's popularity, they ſpared no pains.

            <p>MR. DE LANCEY is one of the moſt fortunate of men. While the people impatiently expected a diſſolution, an expreſs arrived on the 12th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, with a confuſed, but alarming account of an action at Lake George. This rendered it neceſſary for Sir Charles Hardy immediately to proceed to Albany. Thither the Lieut. Governor accompanied him, and had thereby a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ingroſs and cajole him. I ſhall ſuſpend the relation of his ſucceſs, till I have laid before your Lordſhip the progreſs of the provincial army, and their repulſe of the French.</p>
            <p>MAJOR GEN. LYMAN, being advanced with the troops to the Carrying-Place, about 60 miles from Albany, was waiting the arrival of General John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">Lyman builds a fort at the Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Place.</note> who ſet out from thence on the 8th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, with the train of artillery. Lyman had begun
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011701_0036_0F87EB8FDE07D208"/>
fort at the landing, on the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's River, now called Fort Edward. About the latter end of the month, Gen. Johnſon, with the main body, moved forward 14 miles more northerly, and pitched his camp at the ſouth end of Lake George, before called St. Sacrament. By ſome Indians, who had been ſent as ſcouts, he received the following advices: — That they had diſcovered a party of French and Indians at Tinonderoge, ſituate on the iſthmus between the north end of Lake George and the ſouthern part of Lake Champlain, 15 miles on this ſide Crown Point; but that no works were there thrown up. To have ſecured this paſs, which commanded the route to Crown Point through the Lake, had been a meaſure extremely adviſeable. Mr. Johnſon, informed of its importance, on the 1ſt of September wrote to Gen. Shirley, that he was impatient to get up his battoes; propoſing then to proceed with part of the troops, and ſeize upon that paſs. The French however took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the delay, and cut out work enough for him at his own camp.</p>
            <p>OF the troops that ſailed from Breſt in the ſpring, amounting to about 3000, your Lordſhip knows, eight companies were taken with the Lys and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide men of war, who fell in with our fleet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Admiral Boſcawen. One thouſand
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011701_0036_0F87EB8FDE07D208"/>
were landed at Louiſburgh; and the reſidue arrived at Quebec, with Monſ. de Vandreuil governor-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of Canada, and Baron Dieſkau, commander of the forces. The French Court, well appriſed of the ſingular conſequence of Oſwego, had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reduce it.<note place="margin">Dieſkau de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Oſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go;</note> Such being the Baron's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, he immediately proceeded to Montreal; from whence he detached 700 of his troops up the river, intending himſelf ſpeedily to join them with the remainder. Juſt before he had made the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary preparations, Montreal was alarmed with the news of our forming a numerous army near Lake St. Sacrament, for the reduction of Fort Frederic, and perhaps to penetrate into the heart of Canada. Whereupon a grand council being held,<note place="margin">but is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</note> the Baron was importuned to proceed thro' Lake Champlain, for the defence of that fortreſs: nor was he without great difficulty prevailed upon to alter his intended route.</p>
            <p>DIESKAU,<note place="margin">He marches to attack Gen. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> having in vain waited the coming up of our army, at length reſolved himſelf to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards them; and if he proved victorious, to deſolate our northern ſettlements, lay the towns of Albany and Schenectady in aſhes, and cut off all communication with Oſwego. A dreadful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, my Lord! And had he ſucceeded — I tremble at the thought — had he ſucceeded. But
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011701_0037_0F87EB909E0276F0"/>
the Supreme Diſpoſer of events had not yet devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to ruin; and therefore, like the councils of Achitophel, blaſted the ſanguinary purpoſe. —</p>
            <p>FOR the execution of this deſign, he embarked at Fort St. Frederic with 2000 men in battoes, and landed at the South Bay <note n="*" place="bottom">About 16 miles from the Engliſh encampment.</note> Of this movement, Gen. Johnſon had not the leaſt intimation, till his ſcouts diſcovered their actual departure from the South Bay towards Fort Edward. By an Engliſh priſoner the Baron was told that the fort was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs, and our camp at the Lake, when he left it a few days before, without lines, and deſtitute of cannon. Having approached within two miles of Fort Edward, he opened his deſign to his troops, conſiſting of 600 militia, as many Indians, and 200 regulars. To animate his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars,<note place="margin">His irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars averſe to the attack of Fort Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> who ſeemed diſinclined to the attack pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, he aſſured them, that inevitable muſt be their ſucceſs — <q>that on reducing this fort, the Engliſh camp muſt neceſſarily be abandoned, and their army diſperſe in great diſorder — that this would enable them to ſubdue Albany; and by ſtarving the garriſon of Oſwego, ſuperadd to to their conqueſt the abſolute dominion of Onta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</q> with whatever intrepidity this harangue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired his European troops, the Canadians and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011701_0037_0F87EB909E0276F0"/>
fearful of our cannon, were utterly averſe to the ſcheme; but declared their willingneſs to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe our camp, where they expected nothing beyond muſquetry <note n="*" place="bottom">Our artillery was got up to the camp from Fort Edward but a day or two before the action, of which the French had no intelligence.</note>.<note place="margin">He moves aginſt our cmap;</note> Thus diſappointed in his principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he changed his route, and began to move againſt the main body at the Lake. Gen. Johnſon, on the information of his ſcouts, had diſpatched ſeperate meſſengers to Fort Edward, with advice of the enemy's approach towards that garriſon; of which one was unfortunately intercepted: the reſt who got back, reported, that they had deſcried the enemy about four miles to the northward of the fort. Inſtead of any attempt to diſcover the ſtrength of the guard left with their battoes at the South Bay, which might eaſily have been cut off, a council of war reſolved the next morning to detach 1000 men, with ſome Indians, to fall upon, or, as Mr. Johnſon expreſſes it in his letter to the ſeveral governors, "to <hi>catch,</hi> the enemy in their retreat." On this ſervice commanded Col. Williams, a brave officer, who met the baron within four miles of our camp.</p>
            <p>THE Engliſh, my Lord, were encamped on the banks of Lake George, being covered on either ſide by a low thick-wooded ſwamp. After the march of the detachment, Gen. Johnſon drew up
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011701_0038_0F87EB915E0545B0"/>
the cannon, then at 500 yards diſtance from the front. Trees where alſo felled to form ſome ſort of breaſt-work: and this was all his cover againſt an attack; having hitherto ſtrangely delayed the proper retrenchments.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">and meets our detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>ABOUT an hour after Williams's departure, a heavy fire was heard; which evidently approaching, Gen. Johnſon judged rightly, that our detachment was retreating: for the French were ſuperior in number, amounting to about 1800. Upon this he ſent out a reinforcement to ſupport them; which was very judiciouſly conducted on the death of Williams, by Lieut. Col. Whiting, a Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut officer, who gained much applauſe at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Louiſburgh. Gen. Johnſon informs the governors, <q>That about half an hour after eleven the enemy appeared in ſight, and marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the road in very regular order, directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our center: That they made a ſmall halt, about 150 yards from the breaſt-work, when the regular troops made the grand and center attack; while the Canadians and Indians ſquatted and diſperſed on our flanks.</q> This halt was the baron's capital error: for, amidſt the conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the camp, had he cloſely followed up the detachment, he had eaſily forced their lines, and gained a complete victory. But by continuing for
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011701_0038_0F87EB915E0545B0"/>
ſome time a platoon fire, with little execution at that diſtance, our men recovered their ſpirits. As ſoon as the artillery began to play, Dieſkau and his regulars found themſelves totally deſerted by the militia and ſavages, who all ſkulked into the ſwamps, took to trees, and mantained a ſcattered fire upon our flanks, for ſome time, with variable and intermitting briſkneſs.<note place="margin">He is defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</note> Having now no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of any part of his army, except his handful of regulars, the baron thought proper to retire; which he did in very great diſorder. A party from the camp followed him, fell upon his rear, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the remaining ſoldiers about him, and being himſelf wounded in the leg, was found reſting on a ſtump, utterly abandoned and deſtitute of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. Feeling for his watch, to ſurrender it, one of our men, ſuſpecting him in ſearch of a piſtol, poured a charge thro' his hips; of which wound he is not yet recovered. Upon his retreat, the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia and Indians retired in ſmall parties: and as the Engliſh neglected to continue the purſuit, they halted about four miles from the camp, at the very place where the engagement happened in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Opening their packs for refreſhment, they here entered into conſultation, reſpecting a ſecond attack. Why the enemy was not purſued, when their retreat became general, no tolerable reaſon
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:011701_0039_0F87EB921E0739B0"/>
has ever yet been aſſigned; and Mr. Johnſon in his letter,<note place="margin">Gallant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of M'Ginnes.</note> ſeems very artfully to evade it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing however could be more fortunate than the gallant behaviour of a party conſiſting of about 200, led by Capt. M' Ginnes, who had been detached from Fort Edward, to the aſſiſtance of the main body. They fell upon the French in the evening, put an end to their conſultations, and gave them a total overthrow. M' Ginnes died of the wounds he received in this reincounter, having ſignalized himſelf by a ſpirit and conduct that would have done honour to a more experienced officer.</p>

               <note place="margin">Remark on Wraxal's imagination.</note>MR. WRAXAL, in his letter to the Lieut. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of New York, told him, he ſtood ſo near Gen.

Mr. Lyman urged it with great warmth; but the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011701_0039_0F87EB921E0739B0"/>
general with moſt of the field officers, are accuſed of an equal diſinclination. Mr. Johnſon, to judge by his letter, ſeemed well ſatisfied with his eſcape, and determined with this action to cloſe the preſent campaign. It was probably to avoid the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the expedition, that he tranſmitted no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the battle to General Shirley; contenting himſelf with requeſting Lieut. Governor Phipps to ſend a copy of his letter from Boſton, tho' his own ſituation was 200 miles nigher to Oſwego. The Gentleman at Albany, to whom his diſpatches were intruſted, ſuſpecting their contents, and conceiving their communication to the General abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his Majeſty's ſervice, broke open the letter to Governor Phipps, and ſent an expreſs with a copy to Oſwego.</p>
            <p>THE Indians,<note place="margin">The Indians joined not in the action.</note> during the whole of the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome of the Mohawks only excepted, retired from the camp, waiting the event of the conflict at a convenient diſtance. Nor indeed was their aſſiſtance expected, by thoſe who knew their boaſted fidelity was a mere deluſion, and Mr. Johnſon's ſo much magnified influence, what it has ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men, the groſſeſt impoſture. They even declared before their march, they intended not to engage, but to be witneſſes of the gallantry of our troops. And had Dieſkau won the day,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011701_0040_0F87EB92DE02C510"/>
equally ready had they been to ſcalp their brethren the Engliſh, as now they appeared to exerciſe their brutal dexterity on the French.<note place="margin">and left our army after it.</note> Moreover, they came in a body to Albany, immediately after the battle, on pretence of celebrating the ſucceſs of our arms, and to condole with the widows of thoſe who fell in the action. This, ſays one of Mr. Johnſon's encomiaſts, is their cuſtom; ſubjoining prophetcially, that they were in a fortnight after their departure to return to the camp. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, my Lord, obſerve no ſuch cuſtom, ſave on the concluſion of an enterprize; whereas this was ſcarcely commenced: and as to their return, 'tis notorious they never did.

ſlaughter as is pretended by the letter, with the loſs of the greateſt part of the principal officers, and Monſ. St. Pierre, who had the chief command and influence over the Indians, muſt have reduced them to leſs than 800. From theſe, one would have imagined, there was no danger of a ſecond attack. Far more probable was it, that for ſo momentous an enterprize as the reduction of the forts before-mentioned, the French had muſtered all the forces they could ſpare from Crown Point and Tinonderoge, where many of the regular troops were poſted; eſpecially, as they went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed with cannon. Add to this, that our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was now fluſhed with victory; the enemy, on the contrary, diſconcerted; and, according to his account, moſt of their principal officers, and many of their men, ſlain; the Indians too, by the death of St. Pierre, probably wavering and diſſipated. This, if ſuch were the facts, was a glorious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to diſpoſeſs them of Tinonderoge. But the longer they were ſuffered to fortify, the more arduous the taſk to diſlodge them, and the greater the loſs of our preſent advantage, reſulting from their defeat and our ſucceſs. Beſides, was their any probability of their returne the next day, to re-aſſault the camp with muſquetry, when the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our cannon (admiting them to have done

But the cautious ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſubjoins — <q>We don't think it either prudent or ſafe to be ſending out parties in ſearch of the dead.</q> I agree, it had been more for his Majeſty's ſervice to have diſpatched them in purſuit of the <hi>living.</hi> After a ſhort paragraph concerning the wounded, his panic returns — <q>I think we may expect very ſhortly a more formidable attack.</q> More formidable than what? Why, than that of their regulars firing at a diſtance and the Canadians and Indians running away — <q>and that the enemy will then come with artillery.</q> I wonder whether this gentleman expected to reduce Crown Point without being expoſed to the French artillery. But whence this ſurmiſe of a more formidable attack, he thinks not proper to communicate. It was well known, the whole force ſent from France amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to about 3000: — that of theſe, Admiral Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cawen took eight companies, and 1000 were in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon at Louiſbourgh. Admitting therefore that all the reſt arrived at Quebec, without any loſs, (a
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:011701_0043_0F87EB951DFF1B90"/>
favourable conceſſion) the utmoſt amount that reached Canada was about 1700; of which 500 were at Cadaraqui: ſo that, without any allowance for thoſe killed at the camp, or In the mock pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit which enſued, the whole number of regulars that arrived with Dieſkau, and could come againſt him, but little exceeded 1100. The gentleman proceeds—<q>The late Col. Williams had the ground cleared for building a ſtockaded fort: our men are ſo harraſſed, and obliged to be upon watchful duty, that I think it would be both unſeaſonable, and I fear in vain, to ſet them at work upon the deſigned fort. I deſign to order the New Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire regiment up here to reinforce us: and I hope ſome of the deſigned reinforcements will be with us in a few days. When theſe freſh troops arrive, I ſhall</q>—I dare ſay your Lordſhip expects at leaſt the demolition of Fort St. Frederic: nothing like it—<q>I ſhall immediately ſet about building a fort.</q> Still the ſtrongeſt ſymptoms of terror and alarm: for, 'tis evident from this paſſage, he had now laid aſide all thoughts of proſecuting the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſhould even ſuccours arrive, as in fact ſoon after ſuccours did arrive, and in greater numbers than were neceſſary. All his puiſſant purpoſes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated now, "in ſetting about building a fort." And if indeed he thought Crown Point impregnable
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011701_0043_0F87EB951DFF1B90"/>
by the army then under his command, above 4000 ſtrong, he muſt neceſſarily conclude it would be found ſo the next year, by double the number; and if then attempted thro' another route, his grand fortreſs at the end of the Lake was abſolutely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Nor would it prove any defence to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try between Lake George and Hudſon's River, while the French could penetrate it by two other more uſual paſſages, the South-Bay and Wood-Creek; thro' the former of which they had actually marched to his camp. And as to their formidable attack with artillery, whence could they bring it, but from Crown Point? And if they learnt he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, in the preſent campaign, nothing beyond building a ſtockaded fort, that very intelligence was ſufficient to induce them to attack the camp with cannon; againſt which, I am confident, his fort would make but a very indifferent reſiſtance. But, in reality, 'twas moſt probable they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert their efforts in ſtrengthening Crown Point and Tinonderoge; the reduction of which, for not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving our ſucceſs at the camp, will coſt us a vaſt addition of blood and treaſure.</p>

So that if ever any man obtained laurels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out earning them, it was this fortunate general; who, by the ſplendid repreſentations of his ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and the ſovereign decree of his patron, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted into an eminent hero. To the panegyrical pen of Mr. Wraxal, and the — ſic volo, ſic jubeo — of Lieut. Gov. De Lancey, is to be aſcribed that mighty renown, which echoed thro' the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, reverberated to Europe, and elevated a raw unexperienced youth into a kind of ſecond Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough—
<q>Fortunate puer, tu nunc eris alter ab illo.</q>
So capricious is fortune, and ſo fond of ſporting with human affairs. The emperor Severus (I think it is Herodian tells the ſtory) when obliged to raiſe the ſiege of Atras, the only attempt in which he had ever been baffled, thought himſelf conquered becauſe he did not conquer: but our hero, it ſeems, is a conqueror, becauſe he was not conquered. When a general finds himſelf attacked in his camp, a very quaker methinks, would forget his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and follow, in ſpight of Barclay and the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the powerful dictates of nature incentive to ſelf-defence. And did the valour of our warrior carry him an inch farther? Did he purſue an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who by flying, with the loſs of about 30 men,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011701_0044_0F87EB95DE01A400"/>
exhibited a full proof of a moſt extraordinary puſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity? Or, if his wound (which, conſidering it was made by a ball viſible in its flight to his aid-de-camp, muſt have been very capacious) rendered his perſonal purſuit impracticable; were any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders given to improve the fortune of the day, and deſtroy a fugitive army? Was not, on the contrary, the noble ardor of thoſe who offered to purſue, by poſitive orders repreſſed; and a poltroon adverſary ſuffered to eſcape, whoſe recent cowardice promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a general ſlaughter, and who, in their preſent panic, had fallen a ſacrifice to our victorious arms?</p>
            <p>THESE are facts of inconteſtible notoriety:<note place="margin">Why this action was ſo greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated</note> and if your Lordſhip demands, whence then the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that ſix or eight hundered, nay a thouſand, fell before the camp (when, in reality, the enemy loſt not above two hundered in all the three en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, which is leſs than our own loſs) there is no other way of accounting for theſe glaring miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſenrations, than that it ſuited our preſent ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of politics to have this action exaggerated and magnified. It was neceſſary to exalt Johnſon, in order to depreſs Shirley, and they who had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the expedition againſt Crown Point of ſuch prodigious importance, thought it adviſeable to render every thing important that was tranſacted in that expedition. Every man among us knew it to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011701_0045_0F87EB969E01D6C8"/>
be an impoſition; and yet ran the riſk of having his head broke for offering to doubt it. It was notorious, not above 30 of the enemy were found ſlain at the camp; and that the reſt of the dead could neither fly into the air, nor dive into the earth. Where then was the remainder? To anticipate the queſtion, left any one ſhould have effrontery enough to ſtart it— they were carried off by a flying enemy, who took to their heels to ſave their own lives; and yet were ſo anxious about their dead, as to carry them all along.

            <p>NAY, to excuſe this favourite general, the blame of not following his advantage, has been thrown on Mr. Shirley,<note place="margin">Shirley ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured.</note> and attributed to his poſitive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. Beſides the abſurdity of the accuſation, that he could be acceſſary to an omiſſion of this nature, it was abſolutely impoſſible for him to know whether the enemy would at all riſk an attack. Your Lordſhip will conſider, the general was then at leaſt 365 miles from the place of action, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed of it till nine days after it happened. But when he received the intelligence, ſo far from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting to the inactivity of a merely defenſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that he diſpatched repeated expreſſes to Mr. Johnſon, urging him in the moſt preſſing terms, to purſue the advantage already obtained; and if

unable to proceed in perſon, to commit the charge of the troops to Major Gen.

            <p>WE will now, if your Lordſhip pleaſes, return to Oſwego, where General Shirley arrived the 21ſt of Auguſt, and take a view of the courſe of his proceedings in that quarter.</p>
            <p>YOUR LORDSHIP may remember,<note place="margin">Courſe of proceedings at Oſwego.</note> that the troops marched from Schenectady, with ſcarce half the number of battoemen, which contracted for the ſervice; and theſe by frequent deſertions gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreaſed.

               <note place="margin">The general repreſents the ſtate of affairs, and informs the council of his intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</note>THE general informed this council, that thro' the great deſertion of battoemen, the ſcarcity of waggons on the Mohawk River, and the deſertion of ſledgemen at the Great Carrying-Place, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of proviſions and other ſtores had been ſo much retarded, that there had not been at any time ſince his arrival, a ſufficient quantity of dry provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to enable him to go upon action: but as a large ſupply would probably very ſoon arrive, he was determined to proceed immediately. He thought proper to inform them of his intelligence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſituation and ſtrength of the enemy — which was to this purpoſe — That before he left the One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ida Carrying-Place, two truſty Indians, with as many Albany traders, were ſent as ſpies to Niaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra; who, after fourteen days abſence, returned with an account — That the Indians had been two days in the French fort there, which was built partly of ſtone, but principally of logs, being in a weak and ruinous condition — that the garriſon conſiſted of about 60 French and 100 Indians, who ſaid they
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:011701_0046_0F87EB975DFF1F78"/>
had for ſome time expected 900 Indians and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſtores from Canada; but were apprehenſive their veſſels were taken — That letters came in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from Fort Du Queſne, whence alſo they expected a conſiderable reinforcement. The ſpies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Indians were diſguſted at the diviſion of the ſpoils, on the defeat of General Braddock, and that the French had loſt 30 men in that engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment — that they ſaw many Engliſh ſcalps, with a large quantity of cloaths and furniture — that the French had there 70 or 80 large battoes, with which they intended to meet and board our veſſels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this article was confirmed by another Indian, who ſet out after the ſpies, and meeting one of our row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallies, cautioned the commander againſt a nearer approach to Niagara.</p>
            <p>HIS EXCELLENCY alſo informed the council, that in Indian ſpy had been with the Outawawas, who aſſiſted the French in the action at Monongahela — that they had declared their inclination to lay down the hatchet; and that others more weſterly gave the like intimations; which had induced him to diſpatch four meſſengers with belts of wampum, to invite them into our alliance, or at leaſt to engage their neuterality.</p>
            <p>UPON the general's arrival at Oſwego, he thought it neceſſary to procure intelligence from Frontenac;
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:011701_0047_0F87EB981DFCF0E0"/>
and for that purpoſe ſent out a party of white men and Indians, who returned about the 8th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, with information — that they landed upon an iſland, about ſix furlongs from the fort, from whence they had a full view of it — that it was built in a bay, near the edge of the water, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſtone wall; the land behind it cleared, and riſing in a gradual acclivity — that two veſſels of about 40 tons each, lay moored in the harbour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigged, and without guns — that at the eaſt end of the fort there was a regular encampment, and ſix marquis tents; from the extent of which they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it contained about 3 or 400 men. — Upon the ſide of the bay, oppoſite the fort, the land pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected about half a mile: between this and the iſland they were upon was another little iſland, about three quarters of a mile from the fort, inhabited by about twenty Indian families. The ſpies added, that there were ſeveral other adjacent iſlands; but they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered no battoes. His Excellency farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the council, that an Indian who came to Oſwego about the time of his arrival, and had left Frontenac nine days before, declared there were 30 French within the fort; a conſiderable quantity of powder, and many guns mounted on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding wall, which was about ſix feet thick; and the encampment without conſiſted of 600 ſoldiers.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:011701_0047_0F87EB981DFCF0E0"/>
The information of Redhead, to the ſame effect, was alſo laid before the council, with the addition — that there were two encampments, one of Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the other of regulars, in a hollow, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable from the iſland; and that he was told, by the commandant, of a much larger number of troops expected with the general, lately arrived from France; when they propoſed to inveſt Oſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. Gen. Johnſon's letter of the 1ſt of September, ſignifying, that his ſcouts informed him of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of 300 canoes to Frontenac, was alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: and from theſe articles of intelligence — the account of the arrival of the French troops — the ſuſpenſion of all intercourſe between Frontenac and Niagara — and their lying ſtill ſo long at the former; his excellency obſerved, it was not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable their deſign might be to make a deſcent on Oſwego, if the whole force proceeded on the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to Niagara, which was about 150 miles to the weſtward; and from whence, at that advanced ſeaſon, they could not return in leſs than 30 days. That this was the more probable, as Oſwego was of the greateſt importance for ſecuring the frontiers of the weſtern colonies, maintaining the Britiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the great lakes, and the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Apalachean mountains. He alſo took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the defenceleſs ſtate of Oſwego, which would
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011701_0048_0F87EB98DDFD5E40"/>
render it neceſſary to leave a ſtrong garriſon there: that the number of effectives at that time in the three regiments and independent companies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ſerjeants and corporals, amounted to 1376; and that the irregulars, who were Albany men and Indians, procured by his own emiſſaries, conſiſted only of 120. For the better ſecurity of the place, the general had ordered to be built, with all poſſible diſpatch, a ſtrong wooden fort, capable of mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannon, with picquets and a ditch, on a high point, commanding the old fort on the eaſt ſide of the river. This he obſerved was already begun, and would ſoon be compleated: and that for the propoſed enterprize, he had built and equipped a ſloop and ſchooner of ſixty tons each, two row-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, each of twenty tons, with eight whale-boats, each capable of carrying ſixteen men. He then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them of his intention to embark for Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara, as ſoon as the expected convoy arrived, with 600 regulars, including gunners and matroſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Albany and Indian irregulars, one 18 pounder, four 12 pounders, a ten-inch mortar, a ſeven-inch hoyet, two royals, and five ſmall ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel-hoyets, the veſſels, whale-boats, and a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number of battoes; leaving behind him 700 effectives, two 12 pounders, ten 6 pounders, ſix 3 pounders, and eight cohorns.</p>

               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:011701_0048_0F87EB98DDFD5E40"/>THE council, upon this repreſentation, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly of opinion, in anſwer to the ſeveral queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions propoſed, that the force intended for the Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara expedition was ſufficient: but with reſpect to Oſwego, ſome imagined it would not defenſible: the majority, however, were of contrary ſentiments. All agreed, that a feint upon Frontenac, while his excellency was gone to Niagara, was by no means adviſeable. They univerſally concurred in opinion, that a fort ought to be erected on the weſt ſide of the old fort; and that it would be for his Majeſty's ſervice to prepare materials for building one or more veſſels, larger than any of thoſe already upon the lake, capable of mounting ten 6 pounders, beſides ſwivels, two more row-gallies, and 100 good whale-boats.</p>
            <p>IN conſequence of this advice,<note place="margin">Preparations to proceed on the Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 600 regulars were draughted, the artillery and ordnance-ſtores ſhipped on board the ſloop Ontario, part of the proviſions on board the ſloop Oſwego, and the reſidue was ready for the row-gallies, whale-boats, and battoes. While theſe preparations were making, the weather was extremely wet and tempeſtuous. The rains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall ſo heavily on the 18th of the month, that on the beſt choſen ground the tents of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were overwhelmed. As 400 of the troops muſt have gone in open battoes, it was impoſſible
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:011701_0049_0F87EB999DF893B0"/>
to paſs the lake with any ſafety, till the ſtorm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; which was on the 26th of the month, when orders were immediately iſſued for the imbarkation of the troops: but theſe could not be carried into execution.<note place="margin">Which could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted from the badneſs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Tho' the rains ceaſed for a ſhort ſpace of time, the weſtern winds began to blow with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled fury; and were again ſucceeded by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual rains for thirteen days together. During this boiſterous weather, numbers fell ſick, whoſe tents were an inſufficient ſhelter: and the Indians, well acquainted with the climate, went off, declaring the ſeaſon too far advanced to admit of an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the lake.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Another council of war held, in which the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of affairs.</note>IN the midſt of theſe difficulties another council, conſiſting of the ſame members who compoſed the laſt, was called on the 27th of September. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral acquainted them with the untoward ſtate of affairs, and ſome of his lateſt advices. He obſerved as follows — That the preceding day, eight battoes were arrived, with 48 barrels of flour, and 13 of bread; ſo that there was then 14 days full allowance of thoſe ſpecies of proviſions for 2000, being the number then in his camp — That he thought it neceſſary to take with him 21,000 weight of bread and flour, which for 700 men, forty days, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to three-fourths of the uſual allowance — that, in ſuch caſe, there would be left with the

garriſon only 8000 weight of bread and flour, at half allowance for only 12 days: but, by advices received from the Carrying-Place and Mohawk River, he had the greateſt reaſon to expect ſuch a quantity of proviſions, in a few days, as would be a full ſupply for ſome mouths — that a party of men, with two officers, in whale-boats, ſent ſeven days before to Frontenac to diſcover the enemy's motions, were returned, with the following report — That they went into the harbour, and ſaw the fort, which appeared to be a regular ſquare faced with ſtone, having four embraſures in the front — that the encampment conſiſted of above 100 tents — that two brigantines of about 40 tons each, and a ſmall ſloop lying then at anchor, were rigged, and the ſails of one of them bent: and a number of battoes lay near the walls of the fort. He commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to them alſo a copy of the orders and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions given to the French regulars ſent thither; which were taken from baron Dieſkau, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Lake George: whence it appeared, that ten companies of the Queen's battalian marched from Montreal to Cadaraqui, in two diviſions, upon the firſt and ſecond of Auguſt, together with 250 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadians, excluſive of Indians: the number of men therefore at Frontenac, including the garriſon, might amount to 1000 effectives, originally deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

as appeared from thoſe papers, for an attack up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oſwego. He farther took notice of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſome of our Indians, and their unanimous opinion, that the attempt againſt Niagara could not ſucceed this ſeaſon: on which account the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder were reſolved to return to their reſpective caſtles; giving nevertheleſs the higheſt aſſurances of their willingneſs to join us in much greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the enſuing ſpring; — that the Albany traders were of the ſame opinion, that the battoes, tho' well adapted for the navagation of ſmall rivers, could not live on the lake in ſuch tempeſtuous weather as had continued for a fortnight paſt — that Lieut. Holland, who had reſided there above three years, declared it was commonly windy and wet, with few fair days intervening, during the fall. — That it was beſides now impracticable for the veſſels and battoes to ſail in concert: and as the veſſels and whale-boats would not contain all the ſupplies, there was the utmoſt danger of ſpoiling that part of the proviſions and ammunition, which muſt be conveyed in the battoes; in conſequence of which many of them might be cut off; it being more than probable, from the weakneſs of their fort, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would attack them on the lake — that from the returns of the director and ſurgeons of the hoſpital, the number of the ſick amounted to about 300, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:011701_0050_0F87EB9A5DFD2790"/>
of officers; which they imputed to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive rains, and want of barracks. His excellency informed them, he propoſed the erection of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, and a ſtrong redoubt on the hill, weſt of the old fort, before the winter was too far advanced.</p>
            <p>THESE matters, my Lord,<note place="margin">Their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and advice to lay aſide the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Oſwego.</note> were attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: and the council of war prayed leave to add to the general's repreſentation — That Major Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, ſince his reſidence there, was perſuaded 1650 Canadians had paſſed by from Cadaraqui to Niaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, for the Ohio; a great part of whom, thro' ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of proviſions, he conceived muſt then be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their return to Canada; and that a conſiderable number of French traders go annually from Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da to Detroit, and other French ſettlements to the weſtward, who, at this ſeaſon, are generally upon their return: — that their paſſage home is by the way of Niagara, where, it is very probable, they and all the French will tarry, as long as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions admit, for the defence of ſo important a poſt. That there were then but few proper bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe-men at Oſwego: nor could they be provided with a ſufficient number, as thoſe who underſtood the management of battoes were chiefly employed in the tranſportation of proviſions from Schenecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Oſwego, and from Albany to Lake George; and that the ſoldiers were unable to conduct them
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:011701_0051_0F87EB9B1E4367F0"/>
to Niagara, the lake being turbulant generally five days in ſix.</p>
            <p>THE advice of the council, my Lord, was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly to this effect — That the arrival of the battoes with proviſions, tho' hourly expected, was by no means to be depended upon, there being ſcalping-parties in the neighbourhood; one of which, ſince the laſt council of war, had actually killed three, and captivated two of the workmen employed in building the new fort on the eaſt ſide of the river: and the cutting off the battoes was the more to be apprehended, as the Indians in our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance were now returning to their caſtles. Nor did they think it adviſeable to riſk the troops in battoes upon the lake, at ſo advanced a ſeaſon of the year. They approved his excellency's intention of raiſing barracks for the ſoldiers without delay; and thought the fort on the eaſt ſide of the Onondaga River ought to be compleated as ſoon as poſſible; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain adviſed the erection of a work for mounting cannon on the eminence weſt of the old fort — all which, in their opinion, could not be effected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the winter was too far ſet in, without employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole ſtrength then at the place. They were alſo unanimouſly and clearly of opinion, that his excellency ought to defer any attempt on Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara or Frontenac, till the next ſpring; when they
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:011701_0051_0F87EB9B1E4367F0"/>
had great reaſon to expect the junction of a large body of the Six Nations, and ſome of the French allies, who had taken up the hatchet againſt the Engliſh, and were concerned on the banks of the Mononga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ela. Beſides, he might, in the enſuing campaign, have a greater number of troops, whale-boats inſtead of battoes, and a more powerful naval force, which they conceived ought to be provided againſt the next ſpring.</p>
            <p>THIS advice, my Lord,<note place="margin">Which was carried into execution.</note> the general proceeded immediately to carry into execution. Compleating the fort on the eaſt ſide of the river, was a matter of principal attention, becauſe ſituated on a high point of land, at 100 yards diſtance from the lake, commanding the ground round about it — the old fort at 450 yards diſtance — and the entrance of the harbour. Its circumference was 800 feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built of logs from 20 to 30 inches diameter, and the outer wall 14 feet high. Round it was to be a ditch 14 feet broad and 10 deep. Within, a ſquare log-houſe to overlook the walls, and barracks for 300 men. — This fort, called Ontario, was to mount 16 pieces of cannon. Another, called Oſwego, was immediately begun, upon an eminence 450 yards weſt of the old fort. It was a ſquare of 170 feet, with baſtions, and a rampart of earth and maſonry; which, beſides the paraper, was to be 20 feet thick, 12 in height, with a ditch 14 feet broad and 10
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:011701_0052_0F87EB9BDDF94B48"/>
deep. The barracks within were to contain 200 men. This was to mount eight pieces of cannon; being made the more defenſible, as it commanded a good landing, diſtant 150 yards on the edge from the lake.</p>

               <note place="margin">The general labours to eſtabliſh the Indians in our intereſt.</note>WHILE theſe works were carrying on, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral employed himſelf in a neceſſary attention to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian affairs.

            <p>HAVING, my Lord, taken up too much of your time in a circumſtantial relation of the proceedings in this quarter, I ſhall not trouble you with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon them.

            <p>WHILE the general was at Albany, after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the lake, forwarding the ſupplies for the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:011701_0053_0F87EB9C9DF4F5E8"/>
garriſon at Oſwego; preparing for the operations of the next campaign, and examining into the ſtate of the troops arrived there under Col. Dunbar; the city was alarmed by expreſſes from General John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, informing, that 8 or 9000 of the enemy were advancing towards him. Sir Charles Hardy, then at Albany, called in the militia: and a detachment of the regular troops, with a train of artillery, held themſelves in readineſs to march at a moment's warning. But another expreſs gave reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe apprehenſions were ill grounded, and General Johnſon's fears in ſome meaſure abated. It ſeems a few Indian ſcouts had diſcovered the tracks of a large army; but Capt. Rogers, the brave officer before mentioned, came into the camp ſoon after them, and declared, the enemy were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, as the general had predicted in his letter to Mr. Johnſon of the 19th of September, in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up works at Tinonderoge. Upon which, the militia were diſmiſſed to their reſpective habitations.</p>
            <p>OF the malignity of the New York faction againſt the general, I have already acquainted your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: permit me to preſent you with another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſame ſpirit. A mercenary ſcribler, of whom I ſhall ſoon take more particular notice, is pleaſed to inform the public, that <q>Col. Dunbar with his forces, were obliged ſix weeks to lie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:011701_0053_0F87EB9C9DF4F5E8"/>
at Albany, in the rain and ſnow, till bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks were built for them. That they were entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to Sir Charles Hardy, that they got a ſtick of wood to burn. So (ſays he) were our forces diſpoſed of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ALBANY, my Lord, is an old compact city, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 3 or 400 well-built houſes: and at about 16 miles N. W. from it, is the town of Schenecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, conſiſting of about 150 houſes. The inhabitants are far from being indigent: the adjacent country abounds with proviſions; and in ſuch quarters, your Lordſhip is ſenſible, his Majeſty's troops <hi>will</hi> not want neceſſaries; eſpecially <hi>fuel,</hi> in a country cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with timber. Where then the probability, that the forces, which conſiſted of 1200, would ſuffer in a poſt like this? As to the affair of barracks, my Lord, there was a council held at New York, on the firſt of Auguſt, when the news arrived of Col. Dunbar's retiring into winter-quarters, after Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's defeat. It was compoſed of Mr. De Lancey the Lieut. Governor, Meſſ. Alexander, Kennedy, Murray, Holland, Chambers, and Smith; and the opinion of that board then was, <q>That not only the King's forces to the ſouthward, but alſo thoſe that could be ſpared from Nova Scotia, ſhould quarter near Albany, for any future operations.</q> This reſolve Mr. De Lancey tranſmitted to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:011701_0054_0F87EB9D5DF5B550"/>
at Oſwego; and as Dunbar's troops were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to Albany, for the defence of that country, and particularly to make a ſtand, in caſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials were defeated; they had, methinks, the higheſt reaſon to expect favour from the inhabitants, and the ſpecial countenance of the government, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had they been quartered upon them as uſual: and which at preſent is actually the caſe, by expreſs orders of my Lord Loudon. The general, I ſay, had no reaſon to expect, upon this head, any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from the civil magiſtrate. But Sir Charles Hardy, on his arrival at Albany, about the 26th of September, ſignified to him by letter, his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of uneaſineſs ariſing among the inhabitants, ſhould the ſoldiers be quartered upon private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; and wiſhed to have his excellency's orders for building barracks, both there and at Schenectady; leaſt his aſſembly ſhould not chuſe to put the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to that charge. He alſo expreſſed his hopes, if ſuch an expence was ſaved them, of their greater readineſs to raiſe more men, ſhould the ſervice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, the next campaign. The general's anſwer to this letter equally demonſtrated his integrity to the crown, and concern for the troops. He inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his fears, that the conſtruction of barracks would be thought an extraordinary expence; but it being neceſſary for the ſervice, that Dunbar's,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:011701_0054_0F87EB9D5DF5B550"/>
and the regiment of the late Sir Peter Halket, ſhould winter in Albany and Schenectady, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Sir Charles's requeſt; and deſired him to provide barracks for thoſe regiments with all poſſible dilligence, that the troops, on their arrival in his government, might not find themſelves deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of quarters. To relieve the crown in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, he farther took notice to Sir Charles, of the requeſt made by his own government for drawing theſe troops to Albany — that they would in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner cover the frontier of New York — be of ſervice to Oſwego in the enſuing ſpring — and that the inhabitants would draw very large ſums from their reſidence amongſt them. Nor did he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to recommend an imitation of the Maſſachuſſetts Bay; who thought it reaſonable to erect barracks for his own regiment, tho' they knew their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance among them would be ſhort, deſtined as they were for the weſtern expedition. But that there might be no delay in building the barracks, ariſing from any doubt of the expence being paid by the province of New York, Mr. Shirley inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sir Charles, that if they would not, after theſe conſiderations, take that expence on themſelves, he would defray it out of the contingent-money in the hands of the deputy pay-maſter. Thus, my Lord, if any ground for complaint of the want of
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:011701_0055_0F87EB9E1DF7B8F0"/>
barracks, Mr. Shirley 'tis clear was intirely uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable: and if the troops, as this libeller informs us, did ſuffer in their tents, — I ſubmit it to your Lordſhip, whoſe province it was to have found them better quarters. But the fact is, that the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks were finiſhed, and the troops quartered in them before the firſt of December, fuel provided for them ſufficient for the winter, and all at the expence of the crown.</p>
            <p>THE winter now approaching, commiſſioners were appointed by the governments concerned in the Crown Point expedition, to aſcertain their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective quotas for garriſoning the forts <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>William Henry,</hi> and diſbanding the reſt of the army. After this was compleated, the general and Sir Charles Hardy returned to New York; where the former convened a grand congreſs of governors and field officers, to deliberate on a plan for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſucceeding campaign. But before I enter upon their tranſactions, I ſhall briefly lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Lordſhip thoſe between Sir Charles Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and his aſſembly; which was opened on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and continued ſitting till the 23d of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

               <note place="margin">Tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in New-York</note>I HAVE already obſerved, that the miniſtry, from the time of Mr. Clinton's departure in 1753, had been ſollicitous about procuring the conſent of our

This I had from a gentleman, to whom Sir Danvers opened himſelf, and whom he conſulted before his embarkation for his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The gentleman is a perſon of the firſt figure in theſe colonies; and being acquainted with the ſyſtem of politicks in New York, he informed Sir Danvers, that thoſe promiſes were by no means to be depended upon: that Mr. De Lancey was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly jealous of his aſcendancy over the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, who were utterly diſinclined to a perpetual ſupport: that he would join in no meaſures that might weaken the confidence they repoſed in him: that as long as he maintained his influence in their counſels, he would virtually be the governor of the province; and therefore upon the whole, his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and ambition would infallibly lead him to keep every governor in a ſtate of dependence upon him. Sir Danvers diſliked ſo diſagreeable a prediction; and many are of opinion, that its accompliſhment
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:011701_0056_0F87EB9EDDF426E0"/>
haſtened his unhappy fate. Excuſe me, my Lord, for troubling you with a relation of facts, a little out of the ſtrict order of time.<note place="margin">Anecdote of Sir Danvers Oſborne.</note> There is an anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote of Sir Danvers, of which I would not have your Lordſhip uninformed. He arrived here on the 7th of October, 1753, under very diſcouraging ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the people; and indeed not without reaſon, the oppoſition againſt Mr. Clinton having been carried beyond all decorum. Governor Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne's commiſſion, thro' Mr. Clinton's abſcence, remained unpubliſhed till the third day after his arrival. This is uſually done, firſt privately in the council-chamber; and immediately after, in the moſt public manner at the city-hall. To wait on his excellency thither, Mr. Clinton came abroad; an aſtoniſhing crowd being aſſembled at the Fort Gate, to attend the proceſſion. Mr. Clinton's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were very aſſiduous in exciting the popular acclamations; and the huzzas of the mob were ſcarce intermitted for a moment. There appeared, in ſhort, ſuch a profuſion of joy, accompanied with ſome indecent expreſſions reſpecting himſelf, as gave Mr. Clinton juſt reaſon to ſuſpect more open indignities. He therefore ſoon took his leave of Sir Danvers, who expreſſed his diſpleaſure at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his enemies. This, my Lord, proved a day of general feſtivity and Bacchanalian frolic. In
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:011701_0056_0F87EB9EDDF426E0"/>
the evening, the city was illuminated: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon blazed with bonfires: great was the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Madiera; and every company rung with maledictions againſt the late commander in chief, who was charged as the ſole procurer of the new inſtruction; an account of which could only have tranſpired from ſome of the council. Sir Danvers alone appeared unaffected with our intemperate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; and on his countenance ſat a melancholy gloom. He convened the council on Thurſday the eleventh of the month; and prayed their ſentiments on the probability of obtaining a permanent ſupport, according to his inſtructions. That the point was unattainable, they all delivered as their unanimous opinion. He then required the ſolution of the ſame queſtion from each member ſeverally; and ſtill from each received the ſame reply. Upon this, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf about in apparant diſtreſs, uttered a deep ſigh, and reclining his head againſt a window, in a deſponding accent ſaid, <q>What then am I come hither for?</q> The next morning — But I deſiſt. This inſtruction, as your Lordſhip will be pleaſed to recollect, remained unrevoked all the time of his ſuceeſſor: and 'tis natural to expect, that the people of this province were very inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive whether it was continued to Governor Hardy — they were ſo. But Sir Charles did not follow
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:011701_0057_0F87EB9F9DF72C50"/>
the example of Mr. De Lancey, in laying his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions before the aſſembly. The article relative to the ſupport has undergone, as I am credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, very few alterations, and thoſe only in the preamble.

To help your Lordſhip in accounting for his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory behaviour — Mr. De Lancey was bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expelling that governor from the province: and to gain his point, continually fomented the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel he himſelf excited. But Sir Charles was to be treated in a different manner, and meaſures more lenient were to be purſued. An aſcendency over him would enſure to his lieutenant many advantag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and enable him to procure the governor's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a bill, for paying him a large ſum, now due for his ſalary and other perquiſites, while he had the chief command.

<pb n="116" facs="unknown:011701_0059_0F87EBA11DF1B1F8"/>
the general opened the conferrence, by laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the council the King's inſtructions to General Braddock.<note place="margin">The general delivers his ſentiments to the council;</note> He then delivered his ſentiments to the board, to the following purpoſe: <q>That our only enterance into Lake Ontario, was thro' the Onon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daga River to Oſwego. No other harbour had his Majeſty upon that lake, capable of receiving veſſels of force: that Oſwego was ſituate in the country of the Onondagas, the centre canton of the Six Nations, and famous for the furr trade no other mart could we boaſt, for commerce or correſpondence with thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous tribes of ſavages inhabiting the weſtern country, on the banks of the great lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and the many rivers which roll into them: That the Lake Ontario was only acceſſible to the Canadians, thro' the river Cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racqui, formerly called by the French Fleuve I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roquois; but, in their late maps, calculated to countenance their exorbitant claims, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of St. Lawrence. At the head of that river was their enterance into that lake; and near Fort Frontenac, ſituated on its north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſtern edge, about 50 miles, from, and nearly oppoſite to, our fort at Oſwego: That while the enemy kept poſſeſſion of Frontenac, with the harbour at Fronto, and a free paſſage thro' the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:011701_0059_0F87EBA11DF1B1F8"/>
Iroquois River, they would always be able to build and maintain veſſels of force upon the lake: Thas his Majeſty would therefore be neceſſitated to ſupport a naval armament there, at leaſt equal to that of the French. Without this, they might annoy any forts we could erect at the northeaſt end of the paſs at Niagara; and Oſwego itſelf be loſt. The inevitable conſequence of which would be, the defection of the Six Nations, the loſs of the whole country for near 300 miles from Oſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go to Schenectady, and perhaps the reduction of Albany itſelf.</q> The general added, <q>That all the French forts at Niagara, upon the lake Erie, and the river Ohio, thoſe alſo upon lake Huron, at the Streights of Miſſilimakinac, and the Lake Michigan ſtill more weſterly, received all their ſupplies by water carriage from Montreal, thro' the River Iroquois, and the Lake Ontario: That the French ſettlements at the mouth of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi furniſhed theſe northern garriſons neither with proviſions nor ſtores; being not only at 2000 miles diſtance from any of them, but embarraſſed with inſuperable difficulties, by a laborious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagation againſt a rapid ſtream.</q> Hence his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency concluded, <q>That could the French be diſlodged from Frontenac and the little fort at Fronto, and their enterance into Lake Ontario
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:011701_0060_0F87EBA1DDF8ED88"/>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">and propoſes his plan of operations;</note>IMPRESSED, my Lord, with theſe views, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral propoſed, as a plan of operations for the next year — That 5000 men ſhould be very early aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Oſwego, and 4000 of them ſent to attack Frontenac and La Gallette; which being reduced, an attempt ſhould be made upon the forts at Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara, Preſque Iſle, Riviere au Beuf, Detroit, and Miſſilimakinac: and that in the mean time, 3000 provincial troops ſhould march from Will's Creek, for the reduction of Fort Du Queſne: that a body of 1000 ſhould proceed to Crown Point, build a fort there, and launch one or more veſſels into Lake Champlain: And that the force of Canada might be farther divided, he propoſed, that 2000 men ſhould carry fire and ſword up Kennebec River, fall upon the ſettlements adjoining to the River Chandiere, and proceed to its mouth, three miles diſtant from Quebec; and by dividing themſelves into ſmall parties along the banks of the river St. Lawrence, and deſtroying the ſcattered ſettlements there, keep that part of Canada in continual alarms.</p>
            <p>HE then obſerved, that if the ſeveral attempts upon Crown Point, the forts upon the lakes, and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:011701_0060_0F87EBA1DDF8ED88"/>
the Ohio, were not proſecuted at the ſame time, very perilous might be the conſequences. That if in particular, while Frontenac and Niagara were attacked, no attempt was made againſt Crown Point, the whole force of Canada would march to oppoſe us; which would defeat the deſign, and require ſo large a body of troops, as to render the tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of neceſſaries to Oſwego impracticable. So nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous an army might alſo march againſt Albany, as effectually to cut off the retreat of our forces, or at leaſt totally obſtruct their ſupplies: That ſhould, on the contrary, our whole ſtrength be deſtined for Crown Point, and the weſtern operations neglected; Oſwego, the grand object of the French, was in the utmoſt danger of falling into their hands. A loſs irreparable and beyond eſtimation — the loſs of the whole country down to Albany, with that of the Six confederate Nations; and to the French the acquiſition of an abſolute dominion on the lakes, and the whole ſouthern country.</p>
            <p>HIS EXCELLENCY finiſhed, with informing the council of his late intelligence — That the French were building three large veſſels, of ſuperior force to ours, in the harbour of Frontenac: and upon the whole prayed their advice.</p>

it was in the main unanimouſly approved. The council adviſed the general, to give orders for building three or more veſſels at Oſwego. They were of opinion, that 10,000 men were neceſſary for the Crown Point expedition, and 6000 for that on Lake Ontario. The attempt againſt Fort Du Queſne, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The feint againſt Quebec was approved, if it interfered not with the other expeditions. The operations on Lake Onta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, they conceived ought to begin with the attack on Frontenac — and upon the whole, were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion — that an additional number of regular troops would be neceſſary for effectually recovering and ſecuring his Majeſty's rights and dominions on the continent.</p>

of his oppoſers; of which, becauſe important in its conſequences, I ſhall give your Lordſhip an ample detail. The principal agents were Meſſ De Lancey and Pownal, who now formed a kind of duumirate, to perplex the ſervice, in order to ruin the general. Without queſtion, my Lord, you are as much ſurprized, after what has already been ſaid concerning theſe gentlemen, to find Mr. Pownal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the general's enemies, as you would have been had I told you that Mr. De Lancey was not. I am ſenſible, that a perſon of your Lordſhip's high ſenſe of honour, will recollect Mr. Shirley's favours to him at Boſton; and think it incredible to find him in the catalouge of thoſe combined againſt his benefactor. But it is a ſhining remark of Tacitus<note n="*" place="bottom">Beneficia en uſque laeta ſunt, dom videntur exſolvi poſſe: ubi multum antevenere, pro gratia odium redditur.</note>, <q>That benefits are only ſo far acceptable, as it ſeems poſſible to diſcharge them; and that when they have exceeded all retaliation, hatred is returned for gratitude.</q> Mr. Pownal, who was ambitious of recommending himſelf to a certain noble Lord in England, by furniſhing him with American intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, could by no means brook his being abſent from the congreſs at Alexandria, in the ſpring of the preſent year. He earneſtly ſought an introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to General Braddock; and Mr. Shirley did the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:011701_0062_0F87EBA35DF3EC48"/>
office with great politeneſs. He was then juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his appointment to be lieut. governor of New Jerſey, and on that account preſſed for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the council. Mr. Shirley, in a very genteel manner, declined a taſk, which might give offence to the general; and if any reſolution tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, draw himſelf into a ſnare. But Mr. Pownal, being a ſtranger to that diffidence and modeſty, ſo ſuitable to his years and inexperience, became from this moment diſguſted, and was ſeldom after ſeen amongſt that gentleman's friends. He tarried at Philadelphia, till General Braddock's defeat: and towards autum returned to New York. This change of temper recommended him to Mr. De Lancey, who failed not to exaſperate the riſing reſentment: and now his oppoſition became open and unreſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Juſt at this juncture, arrived Sir Charles Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and Mr. Shirley being then at Oſwego, your Lordſhip ſees how ſeaſonable their opportunity, for ſowing the ſeeds of prejudice in the breaſt of the new governor. I will not take upon me to ſpeak of their ſucceſs; but doubtleſs no miſrepreſentations were wanting to ſtrengthen the cabal. Yet no ſooner did the general arrive from Oſwego at Albany, where Meſſ. Pownal and De Lancey attended upon Sir Charles, than the former, diſſembling his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, laboured to procure his confidence, that he
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:011701_0062_0F87EBA35DF3EC48"/>
might pry into his ſecrets: but from previous inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of his preſent diſpoſition, in a letter to a gentleman then near the general, he failed in that inſidious deſign. He could now no longer ſuppreſs his malevolence, or conceal his recent connections; and therefore openly traduced the very man, to whom he was indebted for all his ſignificancy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the provinces. My Lord, it is with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I utter theſe things. But your Lordſhip is as determined to know every tranſaction which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the operations in America, as I am to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the office of a faithful hiſtorian. Truth is too ſacred to be violated either out of fear or favour; and whatever your Lordſhip may think of this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, ſuch was his conduct. I knew him an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed enemy to Mr. De Lancey, and to Mr. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey as ſanguine a friend. I have ſince known him to calumniate the latter, and applaud the former. With a change of reſidence, or rather of intereſt, he changes ſides; and on this account, no man perhaps ever multiplied ſo many adverſaries in ſo ſhort a time. He aims at two governments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt proſpect of peace, if either of them ſhould fall under his command. I can aſſure your Lordſhip, that even in the province of New Jerſey he is ſo little eſteemed, and that principally for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing the diſbandment of the regiment under

To a ſeat at that board neither of them had the leaſt pretenſion; and yet both were highly diſpleaſed at not being invited. Mr. Pownal, who has often diſtinguiſhed himſelf for puſhing a bold point, repaired to New Jerſey, and importuned Governor Belcher, unable on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his age, to attend the congreſs in perſon, to depute him in his ſtead.

The general was therefore charged with ſquandering the King's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in making it the main object of his attention: and out of mere oppoſition, a ſcheme was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for turning our whole force toward Crown Point. Upon this errand, my Lord, Mr. Pownal went home in February 1756. I need not inform your Lordſhip of the ſucceſs of the faction. The ſequel will ſhew with what conſequences it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.

General Winſlow indeed ſucceeded in Nova Scotia: but Braddock was defeated — Niagara and Crown Point remained unreduced — the Barbarians were, let looſe from the wilderneſs — many thouſand farms abandoned — the King's ſubjects inhumanly butchered, or reduced to beggary — one of the <note n="*" place="bottom">Pennſylvania</note> provinces rent by inteſtine broils — in another, a potent faction laying the foundation for new diſaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the courſe of the enſuing year.</p>

ſuffer me, at this inactive ſeaſon of the year, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain your Lordſhip with one or two inſtances of Lieut. Governor De Lancey's more private politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal feats.</p>
            <p>NEVER was any man more impolitic than Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Clinton. Had he kept the chief juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on his favour, he would have governed his province with eaſe and tranquillity: but by granting him a new commiſſion for his office, <hi>during good behaviour,</hi> he ſet him at liberty to act at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and in conſequence of this fatal error, the province was thrown into violent convulſions. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therefore, my Lord, could be more deſirable to his ſucceſſor, than to hold that gentleman under proper reſtraint. Sir Charles Hardy had this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: his office of chief juſtice, I am informed, became extinguiſhed the moment the government devolved upon him by the death of Sir Danvers Oſborne.

<pb n="131" facs="unknown:011701_0066_0F87EBA65DE9AF30"/>
it was paſſed by without obſervation, I muſt leave to your Lordſhip's conjectures.

                     <p>You ſay you're informed, that your lieut.<note place="margin">The opinion of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the law with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to it.</note> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor deſigns to exerciſe his former office, in virtue of the commiſſion iſſued by your late go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Clinton. I can't think your information well grounded; becauſe I am clearly of opinion, that office was extinguiſhed by his acceptance of the lieut. governor's commiſſion: and I conceive Mr. De Lancey will hardly venture to diſpute the matter with, the crown. The main reaſon I go upon is, that thoſe two offices are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. To make this plain to you, you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand — that to every office there are duties annexed. The ſame perſon cannot exerciſe two, offices, inconſiſtent with one another. One of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:011701_0067_0F87EBA71DE70780"/>
them muſt therefore be loſt; becauſe as every office is <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> its uſe lies in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it: and the inferior office is that which is loſt; becauſe it is moſt for the public good, that the officer ſhould hold the ſuperior office; as the law preſumes every man capable of the office, which the King, who is the fountain of offices and honour, is pleaſed to confer upon him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to this, we find many reſolutions in our books: I'll mention one or two — A man cannot be foreſter and judge <hi>eo inſtanti.</hi> Rolls Rep. 452, &amp;c. — Nor judge of the Com. and King's Bench <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel.</hi> Dyer's Caſe. 4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar. the firſt patent <hi>is determined,</hi> tho' the ſecond was granted <hi>pro illa vice,</hi> and ſurrendered the next day. Br. N C. 5 Mar. Br. Commiſſions pl. 25.</p>
                     <p>NOTHING now remains but to ſhew, that the office of chief juſtice and governor of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince are inconſiſtent. To explain this, I muſt inform you, that your ſupreme court is a court of general juriſdiction, eſtabliſhed by an ordinance of governor and council; claiming the like power here in all pleas civil and criminal, as fully as they are taken cognizance of by the King's Bench and Common Pleas in England. Superior to this, is the Court of Governor and Council — a court, inſtituted by one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:011701_0067_0F87EBA71DE70780"/>
inſtructions to your governor. In virtue of this inſtruction, writs of error are returned from the ſupreme court, before the governor and council. The inconſiſtency then of the two offices becomes very apparent: By the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the governor in the court above is a <hi>ſine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> non;</hi> and to ſuppoſe him at the ſame time judge in the court below, and muſt diſregard the abſurdity of the governor's ſending a writ to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand himſelf; and of his juſtifying his judgment as chief juſtice to himſelf in council as governor: and yet be excluded from a voice in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above; which nevertheleſs cannot be given without him. You ſee then the incompatibility is much ſtronger, than if a man ſhould be judge both of the King's and Common Bench in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. There the other judges of B. R. might cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the error in the Common Pleas — but here the courſe of public juſtice might be intirely ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>IF it ſhould be ſaid, his power was only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended, while in the chair of government; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with the obſervation before — that an office is a <hi>duty,</hi> as the very word itſelf implies: and I know of no ſleeping and not-to-be-exerciſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Every office is inſtituted for the public good: the officer is therefore obliged to exerciſe
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:011701_0068_0F87EBA7DDE49680"/>
his duty; for, without that, he cannot ſerve the public — and to be <hi>obliged to act,</hi> and at the ſame time <hi>obliged not to act,</hi> is nonſenſe. It would be more ſpecious to ſay, the inſtruction is no law; as your aſſemblies have often ſaid in other caſes but then, Sir, Mr. De Lancey, in obedience to it, has declined acting as judge, ever ſince the death of Sir D. Oſborne: and why has he (as I have been informed) rejected a writ of error, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, according to this very inſtruction, the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in demand did not exceed 300 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling? Beſides this court of Governor and Council, I am told, has long exerciſed its power, under this and former inſtructions to your governors, of the like tenor, without the leaſt oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>THE offices will further appear to be inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if you reflect — that as governor he is alſo chancellor. The Court of Chancery often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains the power of the law courts: and it is the ſpirit of every court to enlarge its own juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Upon both theſe accounts, the two offices muſt inevitably claſh. I know that Knevet was formerly chief juſtice and chancellor: but the propriety of that double inveſtiture was never ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly conſidered, it was long ago, in the time of Edw. III. There has been no inſtance of the like in latter times; nor do I believe it would be
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:011701_0068_0F87EBA7DDE49680"/>
ſuffered. But the caſe is much ſtronger here — and I can't conceive, for the reaſons above, that your lieut. governor will attempt to ſit as judge, by virtue of his old commiſſion. It it more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, he will prevail on your governor, lately arrived, to grant him a new patent.</p>

            <p>PERHAPS, my Lord, no higher evidence can be aſſigned of a man's influence, than ſuch a bold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of his Majeſty's prerogative. Mr. De Lancey was determined not to loſe an office, which he knew to be the grand ſource of his popularity, and the main prop of his power. For, whoever is chief juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the province, unleſs a very novice, muſt be the ſecond man in the government. Governor Hardy made no oppoſition to this large Pride of ambition: and the other not long after, by his wonderful artifice, ſubjected him to his abſolute dominion. It was effected in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner — Your Lordſhip will be pleaſed to recollect,<note place="margin">De Lancey obliges the governor to paſs two acts of aſſembly</note> that Mr. De Lancey had the addreſs to prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aſſembly to ſend up a bill to the council, on the 4th of February, intituled, <q>An act for the payment of the Debts due from this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; and other Purpoſes therein mentioned.</q> By this, payments were to be made to many cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of the government, <hi>for ſervices done this colony,</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:011701_0069_0F87EBA89DE30428"/>
without ſpecifying what thoſe ſervices were. The lieut. governor was to receive 3787 <abbr>l.</abbr> 16 <abbr>s.</abbr> and ſeveral other ſums were payable to his brother. It was in reality a bill for diſcharging the arrears due to the ordinary officers of the government. To ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it the more palatable to the governor, proviſion was made for paying him alſo large ſums <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the Indians, and the expences of his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to Albany, after the French repulſe at Lake George. When it came up to the council, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a majority only by one voice: and of theſe, my Lord, two gentlemen, beſides lieut gov. De Lancey, were themſelves intereſted in the bill. They were the puiſne judges of the ſupreme court, Meſſ. Horſmanden and Chambers, whoſe arrears of ſalary were now by the act to be diſcharged. Meſſ. Colden, Alexander, and Smith looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as a mean invaſion of the King's inſtructions, which, until they reſigned their ſeats at the council board, they were bound in honour to regard with ſacred punctuality. — It was beſides evidently par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; no proviſion being made for other creditors, whoſe demands were indiſputable. They alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it derogatory to the dignity of that board, to paſs an act, excluding themſelves from any knowledge of thoſe ſervices, for which the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſums were made payable. For theſe reaſons,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:011701_0069_0F87EBA89DE30428"/>
among others, they oppoſed the bill; and prayed their diſſent might be entered, as a vindication of themſelves to his Majeſty. The governor, to whom it was ſent up, detained it for farther conſideration; tho' he paſſed ſeveral other bills on the 19th of the month. This circumſtance, my Lord, could not but chagrin his lieutenant, who had the bill much at heart; not only on account of the large ſums thereby payable to himſelf and brother; but becauſe the paſſing it into a law, would be the fulleſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his aſcendency over the governor; and if he could bring him into diſgrace with the miniſtry, by leading him into a breach of inſtructions. It was plain he would have nothing to rely upon, but his own popularity. This was an important card, and to be ſkilfully played off. So indeed it was: and when I finiſh the ſtory, I am perſuaded your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will entertain no very mean opinion of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican politicians. — The ſpring was now advancing; and it became neceſſary to paſs a law far levying forces, not only to join the eaſtern colonies, on a new expedition againſt the French fortreſs at Crown Point, but for the protection of our weſtern fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, in conjunction with Pennſylvania anſt New Jerſey, which were become fields of blood, by the daily ravages of inhuman barbarians. The bill for this purpoſe originated with the aſſembly: and
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:011701_0070_0F87EBA95DE20E10"/>
Mr. De Lancey, who was now cloſeting the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, was its principal conſtructor. When it came before the council on the 28th of March, that board immediately objected to it, according to his expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: and the governor declared, that if the council approved, he ſhould himſelf give it a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. According to the tenor of this bill, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſigned for the weſtern expedition were to ſerve but forty days, when the province of New Jerſey had ordained their quota, to be diſbandable by Mr. Belcher: and Sir Charles Hardy inſiſted, that the like confidence ought to be repoſed in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The two houſes now engaged themſelves in a diſpute, at a time when, of all others, every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſhould have been avoided. Mr. Oliver De Lancey, appointed by the houſe to provide the ſupplies for the regiment deſigned as our quota to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Crown Point expedition, now gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to ſtop all farther preparations, an open rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between the governor and aſſembly being daily expected. The members began freely to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The council laboured to procure an alteration of the bill — but all to no purpoſe. The principal thing aimed at, was the paſſing of the debt-bill: and a leading member in the houſe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated their deſigns to the governor. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs your Lordſhip will wonder he did not diſſolve
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:011701_0070_0F87EBA95DE20E10"/>
them with indignation. Believe me, my Lord, it would have been a ſtep, at this time, extremely unadviſeable. Forty days intermiſſion between the teſt and return of the writ of ſummons for the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of repreſentatives, being required by law; the public exigencies were too preſſing to admit of any delay. Mr. De Lancey knew all his advantages: and that Sir Charles Hardy might be at no loſs to conjecture that the houſe was now acting at his beck, nor himſelf under the neceſſity of joining with the council againſt the bill, abſented himſelf from the conſultations of that board. The neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring colonies in the mean time were urging the diſpatch of our preparations for opening the campaign. Reduced at length by theſe perplexities, he was obliged to ſend for his lieutenant, and give him his promiſe to paſs the favourite bill for payment of the public debts. The houſe then privately took back the quota-bill; and after a few alterations, the council paſſed it on the 31ſt of March. To both of them Sir Charles gave his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the following day: and they were enrolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our laws, I leave this affair to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's own reflections; obſerving only, that from this period, the lieutenant governor's influence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more apparant than before — and that as it always was, ſo it will ever continue to be, his rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

paſſion, and the grand engine of his politics, to cruſh or controul the King's governors in this province.</p>
            <p>THE plan of operations, concerted at New York in December, was a few days after tranſmitted to Sir Thomas Robinſon, to be laid before his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Intelligence from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</note> for the royal approbation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Pownal importuned Mr. Shirley to be made the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Pownall followed ſoon after them to England.</note> Upon the arrival of the firſt veſſels from Europe in April following, we were ſurpriſed with theſe remarkable articles of intelligence: — That the action at Lake George had been magnified in England into an almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive victory — that Mr. Johnſon was advanced to the dignity of a baronet, and 5000 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling voted by the commons, as a farther reward for his great ſervices — that Eyres, his engineer, was raiſed to a majority — and Wraxal, his ſecretary, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a company. To crown, in fine, the utmoſt wiſhes of his adverſaries — that Mr. Shirley's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct having been entirely diſapproved, his Majeſty had been pleaſed to remove him from the command, and appoint the right hon. the Earl of London ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of all his forces in North America.<note place="margin">Mr. Shirley's adverſaries and why.</note> Than theſe particulars, nothing could have been more pleaſing

to the New York cabal; as they were ſhortly to reap the fruits of all theſe calumnies of which they had been the original authors. A change of the general at once gratified their revenge and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and facilitated the execution of an affair ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſolicited, and greatly advancive of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>I WILL not aſſert, that Mr. Shirley had yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Majeſty's orders with reſpect to the late plan of operations. I believe he had not — becauſe on the 7th of May he arrived at Albany, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his preparations for carrying that plan into execution, untill the 25th of the month, when a council of war was there held,<note place="margin">The general arrives at Albany, and calls a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of war;</note> conſiſting of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing members:</p>

            </list>
            <p>Mr. Shirley laid before them the minutes of the congreſs in December,<note place="margin">and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them with the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of affairs.</note> and acquainted them with the ſtate of affairs. With reſpect to the weſtern expedition, the naval ſorce upon the lake conſiſted, he obſerved, of two veſſels of ten carriage-guns each; two row-gallies, each of ten ſwivels; and that he had three months before iſſued orders for building three other veſſels, one of eighteen, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:011701_0072_0F87EBAADDE774E0"/>
of ſixteen, and a third of 12 carriage-guns. Beſides which, there would be 250 whale-boats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lake, each of them capable of containing 16 men. The land forces then at Oſwego, and on their march for preſerving a free communication between that place and Albany, were his own and Peppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell's regiments, with that raiſed and ſupported by the province of New Jerſey, and the four independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent companies of New York. As there was a maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of proviſions and ſtores at the Canajohary Falls, about 35 miles from Schenectady; his excellency propoſed poſting there 100 men out of thoſe forces: as many more at the German Flats, to ſecure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther magazine, guard the portage, and convoy the proviſions thro' the Wood Creek: and as the fall near Oſwego occaſioned another ſmall portage, a fort was there alſo to be erected, for a garriſon of fifty men at leaſt. It was, my Lord, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt moment to keep open the communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Albany and our fort on the lake; his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency was therefore intent upon raiſing four com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of ſixty privates each, to be employed in ſcouting along the paſſage, and harraſſing the French ſettlements between Frontenac and Montreal.</p>
            <p>THE general gave them alſo an account of the ſtrength of Oſwego, when he left it the laſt fall — adding, that he had ſent up Mr. M'Keller, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer

And your Lordſhip will be pleaſed to take notice, that theſe orders were iſſued very early in March, before the Mohawk ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was open; and that the engineers actually ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Oſwego in April. At theſe ſeveral garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were to be depoſited ſix months proviſions for 7000; and he obſerved to the council, that for that purpoſe, 200 whale-boats and 500 battoes had been diſpatched from the firſt of April ſince Schenectady. The remaining quantity would have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported by the middle of July, had his deſigns been carried into execution.</p>
            <p>As to the provincial expedition, he informed them — that the troops voted by the ſeveral colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies amounted to 8800 men, including the officers and garriſons at the forts Edward and William-Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. One, or perhaps two hundred Indians might be expected to join them, beſides a company which his excellency had raiſed to harraſs the enemy upon Lake Champlain, and procure intelligence of their motions in Canada; and three more, for the like ſervice, were intended to be choſen out of the whole force deſtined for Crown Point.</p>
            <p>ABOUT this time one Rogers, of New Hampſhire,<note place="margin">Capt. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, an active officer, gains intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; of which the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the council.</note>

capt. of a ranging company, gave repeated demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of his activity in the neighbourhood of Crown Point. He made many incurſions upon the enemy, fell on their ſcattered parties, and ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returned to Fort William-Henry, without ſcalps and priſoners. The general took a particular notice of him; and he became ſingularly ſerviceable in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing intelligence. By a cadet whom he took on the 20th of May, we were informed, that the whole number of men at Fort St. Frederic, Tinonderoge, and at an advanced poſt, were 1100, compoſed of the regiments of Languedoc, the Queen's regiment, two companies of the colony troops, and the militia. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there were Indians; but their numbers uncertain: that at Tinonderoge the French had twelve pieces of ordnance mounted, and carriages preparing for an additional number; but that the retrenchment at at the advanced poſt was without any cannon. Theſe troops wintered at Montreal and Chambly; and arrived at the ſouth end of the lake about the middle of April, being plentifully ſupplied with proviſions and military ſtores.—Theſe intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences the general laid before his council; and then obſerved, that the 50th and 51ſt regiments, the four independent companies, and the regiment of New Jerſey, were ſcarce a third part of the number of troops deſigned by the general plan for the operations upon
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:011701_0073_0F87EBAB9DDCC680"/>
Lake Ontario: that the provincials were alſo not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deficient of the complement thought neceſſary at the congreſs, but even of the number voted by the provinces concerned in the enterprize againſt Crown Point; and that it was impracticable, even with the junction of the 44th and 48th regiments, then at Albany, to carry on both the northern and weſtern expeditions at the ſame time: that he had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Indians of the Six Nations; Sir William Johnſon being unable to procure ſcouting parties; and that upon this account he propoſed raiſing four companies for that ſervice.</p>
            <p>YOUR Lordſhip may hence obſerve, what reaſon the congreſs in December had for their opinion, that more troops were neceſſary for his Majeſty's ſervice in America. No reinforcements being yet arrived from England, for carrying the general plan into execution, the council were of unanimous opinion — that 1300 ought to be poſted at Oſwego,<note place="margin">Their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> 50 at the Falls, 200 at the Oneida Carrying-Place, 150 at the German Flatts, and as many more at the Conejo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hary Falls. They adviſed therefore, — that the 50th and 51ſt, and the New Jerſey regiments, the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, and the North Carolina provincials (all which amounted to about 2000 men) ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that ſervice. The 44th and 48th regiments, with the colony troops, were thought ſediment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:011701_0074_0F87EBAC5DF0BFC8"/>
Crown Point. Accordingly, they recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their junction: adviſing, however, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars ſhould continue for a time in their encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at Albany. — The ranging companies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the general, were highly approved; and the raiſing of others ſtrongly recommended. They alſo concurred with him in ſentiment — that a road ought to be made from the German Flatts to Oſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go: and declared, it appeared to them very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſtrengthen Fort Edward, and erect another at the South Bay. The former was a depoſit for ſtores, and at the concurrence of all the routes from Crown Point to Albany. The latter would command the route taken by baron Dieſkau for his deſigned attack upon Fort Edward — a route thro' which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions were frequently made upon our northern frontier. A fort at the South Bay was conceived re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, to cover our convoys of proviſions for the northern expedition from the inſults of the enemy, who in flying parties infeſted the paſſage from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany to <note n="*" place="bottom">For the building of a ſort at South Bay, preparations were making when Mr. Shirley reſigned the command of the army: but the work has ſince been neglected; and the paſſage from Fort Edward to our camp at William-Henry, infeſted all this ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and many of our people cut off, as was foreſeen by this council.</note> William-Henry.

were the very ſentiments which the general repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly communicated to Sir William Johnſon, in his letters, after the action at Lake George; which were then ſlighted by the cabal, who ſtudiouſly oppoſed him in all his meaſures.</p>
            <p>THUS I have ſhewen your Lordſhip the reaſons why the general plan continued to be unexecuted, till the ſitting of this laſt council of war. Mr. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, however, in hopes of the arrival of the expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reinforcements, and loth to be diverted from his favourite deſigns upon Lake Ontario, continued to throw large quantities of proviſions and ſtores into Schenectady, and all the magazines between that place and Oſwego. This, it was ſuppoſed, was done to induce his ſucceſſor, from theſe ample ſupplies, to act upon this quarter; it being univerſally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that Crown Point was now become the main object of the miniſtry. Till the arrival of General Webb on the 7th of June, this was only conjecture, and general report. The effects of the miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of American affairs in England, then be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ten days after at Albany, where he immediately took upon himſelf the command of the army.

            <p>THE whole force, of which General Abercrombie now took the command, conſiſted of the 44th, 48th, 50th, and 51ſt regiments, four independent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, the New Jerſey regiment, four companies raiſed by the province of North Carolina, Otway's, and the Highland regiments, <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe two regiments arrived with him, and conſiſted of about 900 men.</note> and the provincial forces deſtined againſt Crown Point.</p>

This, tho' one of the moſt judicious meaſures that could have been taken, was made the ſubject of low invective. The faction at New York laboured to repreſent it as a project to involve the Crown in a needleſs expence: but time has given the fulleſt evidence of the propriety of this ſtep; and <hi>proper</hi> it will appear to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, before the concluſion of this letter. General Shirley wiſely forſaw, that the Indians of the Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whatever influence over them Sir William Johnſon might pretend, could not be engaged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to protect the King's troops in the paſſage thro' their own country; and that unleſs the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was kept open to Oſwego, nothing could be effected upon, the Lake, nor the garriſon itſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from falling into the hands of the enemy. Accordingly, no ſooner did the ſpring open,<note place="margin">A ſmall poſt cut off in the Indian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> than a little blockaded poſt, with 25 men, at the Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Place, in the very center of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Nothing could ſecure us againſt the repetition of theſe inſults, but paſſing thro' the country with large ſquadrons of battoes: and to facilitate the tranſportation, Mr. Shirley, who canvaſed every expedient for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Oſwego, employed a working party of 80 men, under a director, to remove the obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Wood Creek; by this means, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the Mohawks River, acroſs the great Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-Place, was reduced from eight miles to one.

            <p>RELATIVE to the Crown Point expedition, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the march of part of the army, in a new diſcovered route, on the weſt ſide of Lake George, to the enemy's advanced works, five miles ſhort of Tinonderoge. Which being carried, the heavy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and ſtores might be there landed, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thro' a road to Tinonderoge and Fort Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric: and after the reduction of thoſe Fortreſſes, he adviſed General Abercrombie immediately to conſtruct armed veſſels, to ſecure the command of Lake Champlain.</p>

The two laſt tribes conſented, deſiring alſo, that the forts might be mounted with cannon: and the Tuſcoraras afterwards ſent deputies to him, with the like requeſt: — the Senecas and Cayugas had alſo lately ſignified their acquieſcence to Sir William Johnſon; and the general tranſmitted him the plan of a fort, directing the proſecution of the work with all poſſible diſpatch, as a moſt effectual means to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Indian country to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>BEFORE Mr. Shirley left Oſwego the laſt year, he
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:011701_0077_0F87EBAE9DD66998"/>
propoſed to the Six Nations, their convening this ſummer, in a grand council there, the Indians on the north ſide of Lake Ontario, and round Lake Erie, to conſult their common intereſt, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a correſpondence by annual councils at Oſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. And to draw off the latter from their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the French, recommended to the Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their concurrence, in opening a free trade with the foreign Indians, at the entrance of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondaga river, upon terms more advantageous to all the Indians, than any hitherto purſued. This ſpring Sir William Johnſon informed his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the Six Nations were extremely well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the projects relating both to the trade at Oſwego, and the conſtruction of forts in their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons. To accelerate the latter, the general ſupplied him with 5000 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, in addition to 5000 <abbr>l.</abbr> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to him by General Braddock: and yet, my Lord, he was conſtrained to confeſs, in a ſubſequent <note n="*" place="bottom">10 May, 1756.</note> letter, that unleſs his excellency could engage ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral companies of rangers, he deſpaired of the preſervation even of a free paſſage thro' their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: and whether he has to this day built a ſingle fort, as the general propoſed, I have not been able after much inquiry,<note place="margin">Situation of our affairs with the ſoutheren In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> to diſcover.</p>
            <p>EQUALLY unpromiſing was the ſituation of our
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:011701_0077_0F87EBAE9DD66998"/>
affairs with the ſouthern Indians. Some hopes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were entertained of the fidelity of the Chero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kees — a people warlike and powerful; in whoſe territories the Virginians were erecting a fortreſs. The Shawaneſe nevertheleſs continued their irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into that province: and Governor Dinwiddie was obliged to draft the militia, to oppoſe their progreſs, and preſerve the town of Wincheſter. Theſe Indians alſo, with the Suſquehanas and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawares, committed frequent hoſtilities upon the Pennſylvanians. Governor Morris, for the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country, carried a line of forts on the weſt ſide of the Kittatiny mountains, all along the extended frontier of that colony, from Delaware to the river Potowmac. The government of New Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey proceeded even to declare war againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware Indians; and would have penetrated into their ſettlements, had not aſſurances been ſent by Sir William Johnſon from the council at Ononda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, that the Delawares and Shawaneſe, in obedience to the Six Nations, were under renewed and poſitive engagements, to refrain from any farther outrages upon the ſouthern frontiers. If any ſuch promiſes were really made, 'tis certain they were immediately broken, many of our inhabitants having ſince been murdered and captivated by the ſavages of thoſe very tribes. Whence we may fairly conclude, that
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:011701_0078_0F87EBAF5DE09710"/>
either the Six Nations connived at theſe infractions of their commands; or that their antient ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is become the contempt of their tributaries. In fact, my Lord, the matter is ſtill worſe. Too much reaſon is there to believe the truth of both theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatives.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sir William Johnſon's conduct conſidered.</note>I INFORMED your Lordſhip, that Sir William Johnſon was ordered to proceed from Onondaga to Oſwego, with as many Indians as could be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to march with him; not only for the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual preſervation of that poſt, but to execute the plan which Gen. Shirley had concerted, for the eſtabliſhment of an annual council there, with thoſe Indians who had been long in the French intereſt, and ſeemed ready to liſten to propoſals for an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with us. It was expedient, my Lord, that he ſhould have complied with theſe inſtructions, nay it was his duty; but no ſooner was he acquainted with Mr. Shirley's reſignation of the command of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than he returned from Onondaga to Albany, at the head of about 60 Indians, leaving Capt. Patten with his company of grenadiers, to wander thro' a forlorn wilderneſs, in ſearch of Oſwego. Whether this inſtance of his conduct was not intended to raiſe his reputation with the new general, as a leading man among the Indians, I leave, to your Lordſhip's conjecture. By arts like theſe, he acquired his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:011701_0078_0F87EBAF5DE09710"/>
fame: and the influence of the faction at New York ſo powerfully ſuſtained it, that few perſons doubted his ability to procure ſeveral hundered war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors for our aſſiſtance, though every day exhibited freſh proofs of their melancholy defection. Beſides the deſtruction of our poſt in the very country of the Oneidas mentioned before, the enemy infeſted the parts about Oſwego, and the whole paſſage thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the leaſt oppoſition from the Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Alarms indeed were frequently given of the approach of their flying parties; and it was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that Sir William Johnſon, on thoſe occaſions, as Colonel of the county, raiſed the militia of Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and proceeded to the ſpot; tho' every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Indians well knows, that of all places, theſe are the moſt unlikely for finding the enemy. By ſuch ſham expeditions have our northern inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants been impoveriſhed and diſtreſſed: nor could they anſwer any other end, than to raiſe a bruit thro' the colonies; and with parade and oſtentation ſet the gazetteers upon ſounding his applauſe. — Even in theſe wild romantic excurſions, but few Indians attended him: and yet if we credit our news writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hundreds were in his train.</p>
            <p>MR. SHIRLEY had ſcarce reſigned the command to Major General Abercrombie, when the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the battoe ſervice became ſo irreſiſtably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:011701_0079_0F87EBB01DD83E58"/>
that his very enemies recollected their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded calumnies with ſhame and confuſion. — I allude,<note place="margin">Account of a gallant action of our battoe men under Capt. Bradſtreet.</note> my Lord, to the action between the French and our battoe-men, on the 3d of July. Senſible of the importance of Oſwego, the enemy collected themſelves about the latter end of May in a large body, not many miles to the eaſtward of that gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; from whence detachments were perpetually ſent out to fall upon our workmen, and infeſt the paſſage thro' the Onondaga River. Capt. Bradſtreet' who had the direction of the battoes, was apprized that ſmall parties lay in ambuſh, waiting a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity to attack him. Accordingly, when he left Oſwego, he ordered the ſeveral diviſions to proceed as near each other as poſſible: but ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and irregular a body could not without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty be kept to any tolerable order. He was at the head of about 300 battoe-men, in the firſt divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon his return to Schenectady; and about nine miles from Oſwego, when the energy, who were 700 ſtrong, roſe from their ambuſcade, and fired upon his front. Near the place of attack, was a ſmall iſland, by which the enemy might eaſily have ford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the river. Bradſtreet in an inſtant landed upon the iſland, to prevent being incloſed between two fires; and with ſix men maintained his poſſeſſion, bravely repelling twenty of the enemy, who attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:011701_0079_0F87EBB01DD83E58"/>
to ſeize that advantageous poſt. He was than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> inforced with ſix others; and even compelled a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond party of 40 French to give way. Enraged at this ſhameful diſappointment, the enemy, to the number of 70 men, thought proper to make a third attempt; but the battoe-men, who did not exceed 20, with redoubled bravery ſtill kept their ground, and again forced their adverſaries to retire. During theſe ſkirmiſhes, which laſted near an hour, the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe-men in the rear landed, without loſs or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon the ſouth ſide of the river. Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the enemy now advanced up the north ſide of the ſtream, intending to ford it about a mile higher, and ſurround us. Bradſtreet, aware of the deſign, left the iſland, and with 200 men marched on the other ſide to oppoſe them. But they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually forded over, before he came up, and poſted themſelves in a ſwamp. Dr. Kirkland, with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond diviſion of battoes, was now advancing to his aſſiſtance; but Bradſtreet ordered him, and Capt. Butler, who commanded the third diviſion, to keep their poſts, and cover the battoes in the rear. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived at the ſwamp, an engagement enſued in the Indian manner of fighting, and continued above an hour with dubious ſucceſs. Bradſtreet, at length animating his men, ruſhed into the thicket thro' twice his number, and gallantly puſhed them into
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:011701_0080_0F87EBB0DDD688D8"/>
the river, where many of them periſhed. Another attempt was made, in the mean time, to ford the river a little higher; but thoſe being alſo repulſed, the whole party was intirely routed and diſperſed.</p>
            <p>JUST after the defeat, Capt. Patten, with his gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers from Onondaga, fell in with our battoes; and the next morning a reinforcement of 200 men came up from the garriſon: and but for the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive rains, which began ſoon after the action, and continued all the next day, theſe brave battoe-men would probably have cut off the whole party. Had Sir William Johnſon, as was expected, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Capt. Patten to Oſwego, with the Indians from Onondaga, Bradſtreet might have made immediate purſuit, and many of the enemy muſt have been overtaken: but this pacific plenipotentiary was then haſtening to Albany (a ſafer ſituation) with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant minutes of his late conference. A confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence full of affectionate Indian ſpeeches, and large promiſes of their aſſiſtance; when ſcarce a man of them could be prevailed upon to turn out of his hut for the defence of the common cauſe. Bradſtreet had but three Indians of the Six Nations with him at this attack. Of theſe, one took to his heels; a ſecond fought bravely; but the third went over to the enemy, and aſſiſted in pointing out our officers. In theſe ſeveral actions we had about 30 men killed

Eighty arms were brought to Schenectady; and about 70 men found in the woods, and carried to Oſwego. The French fled in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſorder: and ſome of their regular ſoldiers, being ſtrangers to the country, got bewildered in the deſart, and periſhed for want of ſuſtenance.</p>

               <pb n="160" facs="unknown:011701_0081_0F87EBB19DD6BF88"/>MR. SHIRLEY arrived at New York on the 4th of July, and waited the arrival of my Lord Loudon, who landed there on the 23d of that month,<note place="margin">Lord Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don arrives.</note> with Mr. Pownal in his train: but in what character the latter returned a ſecond time from England, was a ſubject of doubtful, conjecture.— His Lordſhip, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of his eaſe, and the fatigues of a tedious voyage, tarried there but three days; and on the 29th of July reached his head quarters at Albany when he took upon himſelf the command of the army.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Our preſent force, and that of the French.</note>THE garriſon of Oſwego conſiſted now of 1400 men, and about 300 workmen and ſailors. Four hundred and eighty-five were poſted, in ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, between that place and Burnet's Field, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an open paſſage thro' the country of the Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The 44th and 48th regiments at Albany and Schenectady, with the Britiſh troops juſt arrived, conſiſted now of 2600 men; and the provincials, under the command of General Winſlow, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 7000, and ready to march from Fort William-Henry. — Of the naval force of Oſwego, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given your Lordſhip an account: and as to the ſtrength of the enemy at Tinonderoge and Crown Point, according to the lateſt intelligence obtained by Capt. Rogers, they did not then exceed 3000 men.</p>
            <p>FROM his Lordſhip's known abilities for war, the
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:011701_0081_0F87EBB19DD6BF88"/>
colonies were in great hopes, that notwithſtanding the delay of the Britiſh reinforcements, ſome coup d'eclat would very ſpeedily be ſtruck at Crown Point. But alas! while we were intent upon this favourite deſign, the enemy were bending their main force, not to oppoſe us at Tinonderoge, but to ſecure what was to them a matter of much more importance,<note place="margin">Oſwego taken by the French, and the garriſon made priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of war.</note> I mean the excluſive dominion of the great Lakes — Accordingly, they laid ſiege to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwego; and after two or three days conteſt, obliged the garriſon, on the 14th of Auguſt, to ſurrender themſelves priſoners of war. This melancholy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was firſt brought to Albany by ſeveral ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſome of whom had formerly deſerted the French ſervice; and remained many days uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, till the arrival of two ſailors, who made their eſcape after the reduction of the forts. An univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſhock was now given to the whole continent: and to increaſe our diſtreſs, the Indians reported, that the whole garriſon was put to the ſword, and the dead bodies of our countrymen denied even the ſacred rite of ſepulture. But this, by ſubſequent advices, was contradicted: and the ſpies, diſpatched for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, inform us, that the works are intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, and the enemy departed.<note place="margin">Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſiege un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</note> In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by what numbers, it was taken, or upon what terms ſurrendered, I cannot give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

any ſatisfactory account. How many were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on either ſide is alſo unknown; tho' certain it is that Lieut. Col. Mercer, the commanding officer, is among the ſlain.</p>
            <p>IT is much to be wiſhed, my Lord, that Mr. Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's advice to General Abercrombie had been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: and equally to be regretted, that Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Johnſon returned with ſuch precipitation from Onondaga to Albany.<note place="margin">Battoe-men imprudently diſcharged.</note> Nor ought the diſcharge of 400 battoe-men, after Bradſtreet's return, to paſs without ſome remark. They arrived at Schenecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as I obſerved before, on the 11th of July; and methinks the recent proofs of their courage, and the account they gave of the ſtrength and deſigns of the enemy, might have been a ſufficient antidote againſt the poiſon of that council for their diſcharge; which was unqueſtionably deſigned by Mr. Shirley's enemies for throwing an odium on his meaſures.<note place="margin">General Webb's march de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed.</note> To the ſame influence, my Lord, it was undoubtedly owing, thar General Webb's march, with the 44th regiment from Schenectady, was delayed till the 12th of Auguſt, but two days before the garriſon was actually ſurrendered. He had proceeded no farther than Burnet's Field, with his regiment of 900 men, and the remaining 800 battoe-men, when the deſerters brought him the news of the ſiege. Upon the receipt of which, he made a forced march
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:011701_0082_0F87EBB25DDA8460"/>
to the Oneida Carrying-Place; where he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately felled trees into the Wood Creek, to prevent the approach of the <note n="*" place="bottom">The French were equally apprehenſive of his advancing towards them, or of our attempting to rebuild Oſwego: and very prudently improving the preſent advantage, began where General Webb left off, and continued the obſtruction quite down to the entrance into the Oneida Lake; which renders it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to paſs thro the Wood Creek, 40 miles in length General Webb not long after abandoned the Carrying Place, after burning down the forts, much to the diſſatisfaction of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> enemy.</p>
            <p>THESE, my Lord, were great overſights: but the loſs of Oſwego muſt principally be aſcribed to a more diſtant cauſe — to a juncto, who have all along embarraſſed every part of his Majeſty's ſervice on the Lake Ontario. By their miſrepreſentations, the public has been drawn into a dependance upon the Six Nations, merely to exalt Sir William Johnſon: and that nothing might be wanting to procure a change in the command of the army, and deſtroy all confidence in Shirley's judgment, Oſwego, the great object of his attention, has been ſlighted as an uneſſential poſt; and the reduction of St. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric repreſented as a point of far ſuperior moment.</p>

the whole campaign. — Would to God this was all, and we had nothing worſe to apprehend! — Our furr trade, which has long been the principal object of the national attention, and the ſupport of our fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier city of Albany, is at an end. The French can now with the utmoſt facility ſecure the inland coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and confine us to the very brinks of the ocean — a free communication is opened between Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da and Louiſiana; and all our intercourſe with the Indians totally reſcinded. The enemy, on the other hand, may, without oppoſition or reſtraint, render theſe innumerable tribes of ſavages their allies and dependents. The Six Nations are more wavering than ever: and ſhould they no longer think it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to preſerve their neutrality, the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent muſt inevitably become a field of blood. Whatever may be thought of theſe colonies,<note place="margin">The colonies not ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</note> which of late have been magnified for their numbers and opulence, I do aſſure your Lordſhip, that a ſhort war will effectually exhauſt them. Their ſettlements are ſcattered; their frontiers extenſive; the inhabitants but few, generally in very moderate circumſtances, and ſtill luxurious, and without reſources. The ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of a few Indians into Pennſylvania, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready occaſioned the loſs of ſeveral hundred ſouls, and the deſolation of near two thouſand farms. The frontiers of the neighbouring colonies are equally

            <p>THUS, my Lord,<note place="margin">General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the whole.</note> I have finiſhed the relation of what has hitherto been tranſacted in America. I have not only preſented you with a ſeries of the moſt intereſting events, but brought your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip acquainted with the characters and deſigns of the principal agents in our political affairs. If I have erred, I am perſuaded it is not in any article of importance, nor purpoſely in the minuteſt. —E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very line of this letter hath been penned with the moſt ſacred veneration for truth, and a mind ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualy unbiaſſed by reſentment or affection. — For obtaining an intimate acquaintance with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters rehearſed, few in the colonies have had ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or advantages: nor in collecting proper materials, has any one been more aſſiduous. Add to this, that I had no other intereſt in the public meaſures, than the intereſt of every man on the continent. I am unconnected with all parties; neither enjoying any poſt myſelf, nor ſtanding in the leaſt relation to a ſingle officer in the army. The love of my country was the ſole ſpring of my curioſity; and ſo far, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I was not an unconcerned ſpectator of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic tranſactions.

of General Shirley, it was owing to my appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his ſchemes, as conducive to the common weal of the Britiſh plantations: and if my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in this regard erroneous, I have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to find myſelf in very reſpectable company. Except New York, or rather a prevailing faction there, all the colonies hold him in very high eſteem. Some have made public declarations of their ſenſe of his great merit; and that too, at a time when he appeared deſcending from his meridian of glory. But he needed no other than the teſtimonials of his own province; for he, my Lord, whoſe conduct is approved by the people of the Maſſachuſſetts Bay, muſt be diſtinguiſhed both for his abilities and his virtue. They are too numerous and wiſe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, too free and independent to be driven. An undue influence can never be obtained by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of a colony, who has neither power nor pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to beſtow. — Their aſſemblies are annual — the members elected by ballot, in number near 200.— The council, or middle eſtate, choſen yearly by the aſſembly: — and as all the offices are elective, not a man in the province is dependent on the ſmiles or the frowns of the King's repreſentative: — and yet ſo wiſe, free, and loyal a people have approved his judgment; confided in his integrity; teſtified in his favour; and publickly lamented his departure

from the continent. I would by no means, my Lord, be underſtood, by theſe favourable ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Shirley, to diſparage his noble Succeſſor in the command, he yet has not at leaſt he deſerves not to have, a ſingle enemy amongſt us: and I hope it will ſerve the purpoſes of no man to be his enemy. I could only have wiſhed, that it this critical junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a gentleman ſo thoroughy verſed in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can affairs, had been continued in America for his Lordſhip's aſſiſtance. We have to contend with a ſubtle enterpriſing foe — a foe, rapacious, martial, and bloody, committing murders, rather than wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war. Tho' the French coony contains perhaps not 30,000 men capable to bear arms; yet theſe are all under the deſpotic command and ſole direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their governor-general; and experience teaches us, that in ſpite of our navy, they may be annually reinforced. The ſtrength of our colonies, on the other hand, is divided; and the concurrence of all neceſſary both for ſupplies of men and money. Jealous are they of each other — ſome ill-conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed — others ſhaken with inteſtine diviſions — and, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, parſimonious even to prodigality. Our aſſemblies are diffident of their governors — governors diſpiſe their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and both mutually miſrepreſent each other to the Court of Great Britain.

demand ſecrecy and diſpatch: but while the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies remain undivided, and nothing can be tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but with their univerſal aſſent, 'tis impoſſible to maintain the one, or proceed with the other.

Hitherto they have proſecuted the war with ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior advantage; and yet the militia of the province of the Maſſachuſetts Bay alone, undoubtedly exceeds, by ſome thouſands, all the troops of Canada. Since the commencement of the preſent hoſtilities, his Majeſty has loſt above 3000 loyal ſubjects: and as all the Indians are at the devotion of the French, and Oſwego is now loſt, many thouſand farms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the opening of the next ſpring, will probably be abandoned; and the interior ſettlements delug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the innocent blood of all ages and ſexes.

            <p>WHAT the preſent or the next campaign will bring forth, is known only to the Omniſcient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the univerſe.

I fear the worſt — and yet you know, my Lord, I am not of a melancholy caſt. There is too much reaſon for general concern: and I venture to predict, what every judicious perſon foreſees, that unleſs ſome ſucceſsful blow is ſtruck— and ſpeedily ſtruck, at the the power of France, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain muſt inevitably loſe her poſſeſſions in America.

ſtruggle: but a lingring conſumption will infallibly enervate and deſtroy. France has been, ever can, and will be annually, throwing over freſh troops into her colony, in defiance of our great maritime force: and ſhould peace enſue, even before our ruin is compleated, what will be the ſtate of theſe provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon the next rupture between the two crowns, when the inland country is filled with our enemies? —As you therefore value, my noble Lord, the cauſe of liberty; the glory of the Britiſh name; the honour and dignity of the beſt of Kings; and the preſervation of theſe colonies from bloody carnage and total ruin; exert, I beſeech you, exert your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, to extirpate this brood of French ſavages from the face of the continent.
