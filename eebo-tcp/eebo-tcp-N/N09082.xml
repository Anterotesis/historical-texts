            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE few hiſtories of the ſettling of New-England now extant, are very ſcarce among the people in genaral; and the riſing generation in particular, are very much unacquainted with the diſtreſſes their anceſtors encounter'd, whoſe zeal and virtue ſhould not be forgotten.—It is apprehended a brief view of their trials, hardſhips and perils, may not be altogether unprofitable to thoſe few of them who ſhall read the following diſcourſes. The hiſtorical part is ſomewhat more enlarged upon in ſome few inſtances here, than it was in the delivery. As to any faſts, where the author conceived any diſputes would ariſe in the minds of any perſons, he has carefully cited ſome of thoſe authorities which ſupport them. Where no diſpute in any minds was apprehended, he has been loſs ſollicitous. Only a few brief hints could be given in theſe limitted diſcourſes—a compleat hiſtory from ſome able hand, is ardently wiſhed for. Were thoſe things related with that energy the importance of the ſubject calls for, they could not fail of engaging univerſal attention. That our privileges, civil and religious, may be continued inviolate, and that ſerious, devout, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſpirit, which animated, and ſo happily diſtinguiſhed our forefathers may prevail, to the lateſt poſterity, is the ardent prayer of</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE are ſome of the words of Moſes, the man of GOD, which he ſpake to the children of Iſrael, the diſtinguiſh'd people of the LORD, not long before he went from the plains of Moab unto the top of mount Piſgah, where that eminent ſervant of the LORD expir'd. He reminds them of the wonderful things GOD had done for them—the ſtatutes and judgments, in ſpecial given to them—their peculiar obligations faithfully to ſerve the LORD, and the dreadfully aggravated doom, which would be the conſequence of their neglect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoſe things were faithfully and very carefully to be tranſmitted to poſterity. The riſing generation was to be led to an intimate and particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with GOD's wonderful works, and miraculous operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for that people. When they faſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed and humbled themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD for their ſins, under a ſenſe of heavens frowns, in after generations, we find they took ſpecial notice of thoſe glorious things

GOD had done for their fathers.<note n="a" place="bottom">Neh 9 Chap.</note>By reflecting upon which, they were brought more fully to that humility, which is neceſſary to keep a faſt to the LORD acceptably. Agreeable hereto, we find Moſes in our context, giving that people, a very ſolemn exhortation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and obedience, calling heaven and earth to teſtify againſt them, that they ſhould ſoon utterly periſh from off the land which they were going to poſſeſs, if they departed from the LORD and did evil in his ſight. In this ſolemn addreſs they are led to conſider what aſtoniſhing things GOD had done for and before them; and their peculiar obligations thence ariſing, to fear and ſerve the LORD. In what a grave and ſolemn, affectionate and ſtriking manner doth Moſes rehearſe theſe things to them, from V.32 and onward: aſk former ages <hi>even from the days that GOD created man</hi>—look to diſtant places, even <hi>from one ſide of heaven to the other, whether there hath been any thing known or beard of, like what GOD hath done for you? Did ever any people hear GOD ſpeaking to them from the midſt of fire, as thou haſt heard and live?</hi> The ſtriking repreſentation and affectionate addreſs, he cloſes with the words of our text. <hi>And becauſe he loved thy fathers, therefore he choſe their ſeed after them,</hi> &amp;c. Where Obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As GOD had a peculiar regard to their fathers, Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, ſo GOD extended his compaſſionate regards and the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of diſtinguiſhing reſpect to their offspring. Is not the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to us and our fathers?—GOD took Abraham from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, from his kindred and country;—ſent him to ſet up GOD's true worſhip in a ſtrange land. The Almighty took our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from their native land, when the nation was in confuſion, and they groaned under ſpiritual tyranny, being extremely harraſs'd, ſome caſt into priſons, others beſet in their houſes for worſhipping GOD according to the dictates of their own conſciences, which was then prohibited.<note n="b" place="bottom">Vid. Pr. Chron. of N. E. V.1 P 23. Mort. Mem. P. 1 2.</note> GOD brought them into this land to ſet up his worſhip here. And notwithſtanding the refractorineſs of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, yet GOD hath made them his peculiar care. Obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD furniſhed them with the cleareſt evidences of his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing regard, by the wonderful things he had done for and in the midſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011595_0006_0F87457E21623BF0"/>
of them. That people had ocular demonſtration of the moſt aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles and a ſeries of wonderful providences; ſome of which are enumerated in our text and verſes preceeding. The angel of the covenant the LORD JESUS, under the character of Iſrael's GOD and lawgiver ſpake to them from the burning buſh and quaking mount—<hi>took them by ſigns and terrors from the midſt of another nation—drave out from before them nations greater and mightier than they were</hi>—Og King of Baſhan, and Sihon King of Heſhbon: giving his choſen their land for a poſſeſſion. Since the canon of ſcripture is full, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are not to be expected: bateing which we ſhall find that which is very ſimilar to this, in the conduct of divine providence to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; from before whom GOD hath driven out the nations that dwelt in this land. As they grew ripe for ruin, filling up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their ſins, GOD gave us their land for an inheritance, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is this day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE improvement they were to make of theſe diſpenſations, in a ſolemn manner urged. Conſider in thine heart, the LORD he is GOD, and he alone—ſupreme governor of all worlds—infinitely wiſe, holy, juſt and good: Him you are under peculiar advantages to know, and the moſt inviolable obligations to obey—to keep thoſe ſtatutes and commandments GOD had given them. They are call'd upon and charged, ſeriouſly to conſider what a being GOD is; what he had done for them, and the obligations thence ariſing—to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the knowledge of them to future generations, and by holy lives, recommend true religion, the worſhip and ordinances of GOD, to their offspring. Thus were they to perpetuate the knowledge of theſe things, and that holy religion which GOD commanded, to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages. Our obligations are far from being inferior, nor is our duty leſs important.</p>
            <p n="4">4. HERE are peculiar motives ſet before them, powerfully to induce and even conſtrain them to the conſcientious obſervance, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous improvement of theſe things. That it might go well with them—that they might enjoy peculiar comfort in life, having GOD's gracious preſence with them—divine protection afforded—ſee many good days here, enjoying ſpiritual and temporal bleſſings in this
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011595_0007_0F87457EF10C7908"/>
world, and a bleſſed immortality beyond the grave. And that it, might go well with their children; that they might be bleſſed in him in whom (it was promiſed) all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed—tranſmit to poſterity yet unborn, peculiar bleſſings and priviledges unimpaired—that after having prolonged their days in that good land, and come to their graves like a ſhock of corn fully ripe; ſtill they, in their ſeed, might forever, even to the lateſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations dwell and be happy in that good land which the LORD their GOD had given them by promiſe, and was now ready to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to the poſſeſſion of. By a rich variety of intereſting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, GOD is graciouſly pleaſed, to enforce man's duty. Not barely their own felicity, but the good of their poſterity is brought into the account. As thoſe temporal bleſſings were typical of celeſtial joys, ſo every thing for themſelves, together with thoſe near and moſt dear to them, is ſuggeſted, to animate them to conſider GOD's works and obey his commands.</p>
            <p>FROM the words of our text thus conſider'd, a variety of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations not unſuitable to the preſent ſolemn occaſion, offer themſelves to ſerious meditation. Particularly, we might conſider, the infinite ſelf-moving love and mercy of GOD to fallen creatures; and how theſe have been diſplay'd in various ages.—How GOD is a covenant keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD, handing down bleſſings to his people and their offspring—what peculiar deliverances GOD grants his people—the ways and means, times and occaſions of them.—That it is infinitely eaſy with the Almighty to drive out the ſtrongeſt nations from before the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; <hi>cauſing one to chaſe a thouſand, and two to put ten thouſand to flight.</hi> But paſſing theſe without particular enlargement; the method pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, on the preſent occaſion, is to conſider,

            <p>WHEN GOD paſſed before the children of Iſrael in a wonderful ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the moſt aſtoniſhing, miraculous operations, he gave this in charge to them, Deut. vi, 7-13, diligently to teach their children, &amp;c. Moſes Joſhua, Samuel and David, took ſpecial care to remind that people, of what GOD had done for them. The man after GOD's own heart, when exhorting the people to praiſe and glorify GOD, calls upon them <hi>to ſhew his wonders among the heathen, and declare them among all the people.</hi> Accordingly they ſhewed forth theſe <hi>in the land of Ham.</hi>

For this, regiſters have been kept, as the LORD commanded Moſes, Exod. xvii, 14.—Places have been named with this in view. Thus Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob called the place where he received ſo much mercy, <hi>Bethel,</hi> for GOD was there. Hagar named the place where GOD relieved her <hi>Beer-labai-roi, the well of him that liveth and looketh upon me.</hi> The Jews ſtamp'd mercies and extraordinary works on the names of days. Thoſe, in which GOD deliver'd them from the horrid maſſacre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by wicked Haman, they called <hi>Purim,</hi> after the name Pur, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the lot he caſt for their lives.—Recognizing the wonderful works of GOD was not confined to the former diſpenſation. When the face of Stephen appear'd as if it had been the face of an angel, how carefully does ho recapitulate theſe in the viith ch. of the Acts—The apoſtle Paul ſpeaks of thoſe extraordinary things done, and judgments which heaven inflicted on that people in 1 Corinth. x. ch.—Many other ſcriptures might be cited, here in point, evincing it IS GOD's command, hath been the practiſe and is the duty of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

to perpetuate the memory of his wonderful works. And it is reaſonable, that as GOD commands, ſo he ſhou'd, (humanly ſpeaking) expect this. There is in mankind a general deſire of knowing things remarkable among men. How ſolicitouſly then ſhou'd the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of GOD be attended unto? When theſe are handed down from age to age, they ſhew forth the greatneſs and glory, juſtice, or mercy, goodneſs or veracity of GOD; and tend to excite men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in their hearts and know that the LORD he is GOD. This being realized, hath a natural tendency to fill the minds of intelligent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with a ſolemn awe of the Supreme Majeſty. Had mankind a <hi>proper</hi> ſenſe of the infinite greatneſs and glory of the Deity, what an happy influence wou'd it have upon their minds and morals! When they ſet the LORD before their faces, they will, in ſome ſenſe, live in his fear.—How juſtly may it then be expected that dependant, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable beings ſhould tranſmit to future generations, the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and peculiarly affecting providences of GOD. This leads,</p>
            <p>II. TO CONSIDER how GOD hath driven out the nations, the abori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, from before our fathers, and thoſe of the preſent generation, to give us their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.</p>
            <p>ALL the providences of GOD harmonize, and are over-rul'd for bringing about the glorious deſigns of heaven; and ſo will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue 'till the ſcene of mutable things here below, ſhall terminate in the final conſummation of all things. Some footſteps of divine providence, we may at preſent, briefly trace; ſhewing how we were brought to the poſſeſſion of this good land, which the LORD our GOD hath given us. What future ſcenes we, (or poſterity) may have to paſs through, GOD only knows. Innumerable, and to us incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, were the trials, perils and hardſhips, which our anceſtors endur'd, in firſt ſettling of <hi>New-England:</hi> while briefly recollecting ſome few of which, I rely upon the candor, and hope for the patience of this auditory; and that the riſing generation in ſpecial, (who have had but little opportunity to be acquainted with theſe things) may receive ſome inſtruction and improve to the nobleſt purpoſes, theſe wonderful works of the LORD.</p>

enjoy their <hi>liberty</hi> in their native country. Whereupon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to remove into the Netherlands. After many hindrances and difficulties, (which through the good hand of GOD upon them they ſurmounted) they went from England to Holland about the year 1608. Tarried about a year at Amſterdam—then removed to Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; where they lived above eleven years, in great love and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, both among themſelves and neighbour citizens.<note n="d" place="bottom">Prince's Chron of N.

The wide and boiſtrous atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic (which was then very much unknown) to be paſs'd over. This cou'd not fail of being very trying, eſpecially to tender female minds, while they heard the cries and groans, and ſaw the ſighings and tears of friends and children. They were coming to an inhoſpitable ſhore, among ſavage barbarians, whoſe tender mercies were cruelty. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, diſtreſs and ten thouſand difficulties ſhared them full in the face. Yet, animated with noble ſentiments of liberty, they came hither. Dec. 31, 1620, being LORD'S day, was the firſt ſabbath they kept on ſhore, and in the houſe of their building; at which time we may fix the aera of the firſt ſettlement of N. England. After the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd tryals were paſſed through, they had immediately to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter hunger and cold, with great fear and danger, in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their ſettlement. The ſeverity of the ſeaſon, in a rigid climate, without any convenient habitations, where the conveniences of life were all wanting, and neceſſaries very ſcarce, was very diſ-diſtreſſing. The hardſhips were too great for a great part of them. Within two or three months one half of them who arriv'd at Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, were landed in eternity. Conſidering the fatigues of a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voyage, the ſeaſon when they arriv'd, the ſcarcity of their proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the like, it is a wonder any ſurvived.

GOD had indeed made way in his holy and wiſe providence, for their tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſion of this land, by ſending deſolating ſickneſs among the natives, which ſwept them away, as with the beſom of deſtruction.

This year (1636) ſome towns on Connecticut river began to be ſettled. In the beginning of the year enſuing (1637) there was open war with the natives, called the Pequod war.

They attack'd Saybrook fort, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bold attempts in the face of danger. Upon this, the Engliſh plantations united their little forces, carried the war into the enemy's country, and, under the ſmiles of heaven, preſently extirpated the tribe that had engaged againſt them.

year <q>the enemies affairs were at the higheſt flow and thoſe of the Engliſh at the loweſt ebb.</q> In this critical juncture of affairs, <hi>the prieſts, the miniſters of the Lord, wept between the porch and the altar, ſaying, ſpare thy people O</hi> LORD, <hi>and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen ſhou'd rule over them: wherefore ſhould they ſay among the people where is their</hi> GOD? <hi>If the heathen which environ us round, ſhould cut off our name from the earth; what wilt then do for thy great name?</hi> Preſently after, a ſudden change took place, GOD <hi>was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for his land, and pitied his people; in the mid'ſt of judgment, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered mercy.</hi> The LORD of hoſts heard and delivered his choſen. Animated with a truly martial ſpirit, our troops proved victorious and purſued their enemies to their lurking places. The enemy were diſtreſs'd and diſhearten'd; multitudes ſlain and many captivated. After which many, upon promiſe of mercy, ſurrender'd themſelves. And not long after, Philip, their leader, was killed by one of his men, that had deſerted from him.—Upon which, various tribes beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for peace and the power of the enemy was very much broken, ſo as never again to recover. So that within the ſpace of two years, that bloody and diſtreſſing war which threaten'd the entire deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Engliſh, in New England, was brought to an happy iſſue. In this war, fortreſſes were demoliſhed, bloody battles fought, and numbers ſlain; which though ſmall compar'd with many other wars, in populous countries; ye theſe were the ſtruggles of an infant ſtate; who were few in number: from before whom, GOD drave out <hi>nations, greater and mightier than they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DURING this bloody war, accounts were tranſmitted home, yet no aſſiſtance was receiv'd. Neither ſhips, men or money were ſent to them, under the intollerable burthen of all thoſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011595_0019_0F87458BB738F680"/>
thoſe privileges which were dearer to them than life, and for which they left their native country! Inſtead of the pity of their Prince, behold their privileges and charters are ſought for—thoſe charters which encouraged them to ſettle in this country, in expectation of greater civil and religious liberty, than many—of their fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, at that day enjoyed.</p>
            <p>A GOVERNOR was ſent to Boſton, ſuppoſed to be a bigotted papiſt. He made high profeſſions of regard to the public good &amp; the welfare of the people; but it is obſerved, that Nero, who was cruel to a proverb, <q>conceal'd his tyrannical diſpoſition more years than this man did months.</q> In time of war, ſo far as his power extended, he cruelly forbid and hindred the people from garriſoning their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by which means many lives were loſt. Governmental affairs were tranſacted by himſelf, with a low of his creatures. He threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd the people with the deprivation of their civil and religious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges. Perſonal property, in the hands of ſuch an one became very precarious, and many things were ſo conducted, that poſterity will be ſhocked with the account. The people had no where to cry, but to the ſovereign King of Kings, whoſe dominion is over all.—He graciouſly heard their cries and introduced a glorious revolution, which dethroned King JAMES, and enthroned a proteſtant King and Queen; and thereby in ſome meaſures relieved New-England, which had been involved in frequent and very expenſive wars and groaned under the weight of an heavy debt. Our predeceſſors were inſpired with a noble thirſt for liberty. This reigns in every noble breaſt, and was illuſtriouſly manifeſted by the firſt planters of New-England.—They bore the iron rod of deſpotic power with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and were ready to improve the firſt opportunity to eaſt off the yoke. The firſt hints of the revolution animated them—At Boſton they ſeized the man that had oppreſs'd them—Though fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, yet not diſhearten'd they ſent an army, and reduc'd Port Royal; which was ſeven years after given up at the treaty of Ryſwick. The ſame year (1690) the reduction of Canada was attempted. From the year, 1687, there had been war with the eaſtern ſavages. Many lives and much treaſure was loſt in this undertaking, againſt Canada

Anne's war with France began 1703, which involv'd N. England in another long, bloody and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive war. Deerfield was taken in 1703-4, by three hundred French and Indians, on the 29th of February. About forty perſons were kill'd, and about an hundred carried into captivity, among whom was the Rev. Mr. Williams, their miniſter, with his wife and five children, leaving two of his children dead, and his houſe in flames. You may read the tragical account, in the ſhort but affecting hiſtory which he himſelf wrote concerning it. Several other places were attacked the ſame year, and almoſt ruined. The country was kept in a perpetual alarm. Applicable to them was that of the apoſtle, 2 Cor. iv. 7, 8. <hi>We are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; we are peplexed, but not in diſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; coſt down, but not deſtroyed.</hi> Who can conceive the diſtreſs of a people continually alarm'd, and every where expoſed to the ravages of cruel barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who exerciſed themſelves in the infernal art of torture. In 1706, there was intelligence of a threaten'd invaſion from Canada. Probably they divided their forces; for many places were beſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one and the ſame time. An unſucceſsful expedition againſt Port-Royal was undertaken in 1707—The year enſuing advice was
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011595_0021_0F87458D2166B860"/>
again receiv'd that the Canadians would attempt the reduction of N. England. The deſign'd invaſion was prevented, by the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of divine providence, and their plan wonderfully diſconcerted. This year the enemy killed the Rev. Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rolf, of Haverhill, and about forty perſons, laying great part of the place in aſhes, and captivating ſeveral. Notwithſtanding the continual fears, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſtreſſes of the people, yet upon information from home that another invaſion upon Canada was deſigned, they chearfully raiſed, and for ſeveral months kept in pay, a number of troops to join thoſe forces; till, to their inexpreſſible ſorrow, they heard the deſign'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was laid aſide. Mean while the Indians kept continually harraſſing their frontiers, and attack'd Deerfield juſt after the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants had return'd from captivity.</p>
            <p>In 1710, being aſſiſted by ſhips from home, they reduc'd Port-Royal again. The next year, fifteen ſail of men of war, forty tranſports, and ſeven thouſand troops, ſail from Boſton (July 30, 1711) to invade Canada; but were miſerably diſappointed. Eight or nine of their ſhips were daſh'd to pieces on the rocks, in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver St. Lawrence, and a thouſand men drowned.<note n="u" place="bottom">Gov. Hutch. Hiſt. Maſſ. V. 2. P. 193, 194.</note> This loſs and diſappointment were exceedingly diſcouraging to many, who gave over all thoughts of ever obtaining the conqueſt of Canada. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated diſappointments and blaſted attempts were apprehended, to be plain indications, that heaven did not deſign, North-America ſhou'd be ſubject to one crowned head.—To add to the misfortunes of this year, conſiderable part of the town of Boſton was burnt. Freſh attacks were made by the Indians the beginning of the following year (in 1712.) Thoſe ſavages mute frequent incurſions, killing and captivating numbers, till peace between the two contending powers in Europe took place; which was ſucceeded with a treaty of peace which the natives entered into, profeſſing themſelves the faithful ſubjects of the crown of Great-Britain, in 1713. For almoſt forty years there had been a ſcene of war and blood ſhed, with very ſmall intermiſſions. Five or ſix thouſand of the braveſt youth, and moſt valient warriors in New-England ſell ſacrifices to the heathen's rage,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011595_0022_0F87458DDEFEBCF8"/>
during thoſe wars. Peace was then enjoyed for ten years. In 1723, the ſavages began once more to haraſs our frontiers—they ſell upon various towns, and kill'd the Rev. Mr. Willard of Rutland. This war laſted about two years; when the Engliſh deſtroyed the Indian ſettlements at Norridgwalk, with a great part of that tribe. This brought them to terms of peace, which was ratified in 1725. In this war Capt. Lovel was ambuſh'd by the enemy, and ſlain, with ſeveral of his brave men. From 1725 the land had peace for nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years; when war being proclaim'd between England and France (in 1744) we were called again to war. Many among us not only remember, but ſome of theſe were perſonally in thoſe rencounters. Several towns were ſacked and burnt, with a ſcene of bloodſhed. Men, women and children tortur'd and butcher'd in the moſt tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal manner. Again "were heard the moſt bitter groans of the tortur'd, dying father! the ſhrill ſchreeches of the tender and diſtreſſed mother! with the piercing accents of the dying babe, on whom they exerciſed the infernal art of torture. The enemy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the reduction of Annapolis-Royal repeatedly (in 1745) but were diſappointed.</p>
            <p>GOD in his providence rouſed the martial ſpirit in New-England. An expedition againſt a ſtrong fortreſs on the iſland of Cape-Breton was plann'd and proſecuted with inimitable ardor. A ſeries of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing events and almoſt miraculous interpoſitions of heaven facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the conqueſt of that important place. GOD, not only made the ſtars in their courſes fight for us, by ordering the ſeaſon favourable to our army, encampments and entrenchments, beyond what was ever known at that place before: but alſo by overruling the affairs in ſuch a manner that even the very balls from the enemies cannon were of no ſmall ſervice to our army. Almoſt as ſoon as they fell, they were return'd with advantage: timely ſupplies arrived to our army, either by tranſports or prizes.

with which it was carried on—the extraordinary ſpirit of prayer poured forth on the inhabitants of this land—how our army was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from the power of their enemies and the perils of waters—landed—ſought—prevail'd—when the navy and army had juſt agreed on a general and deſperate aſſault by ſea and land; which would doubtleſs have been exceeding bloody and its conſequence was very precarious. At that critical moment GOD influenc'd them to a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſurrendering of that important fortreſs. When the ſtrength of the place was known (which was not till after the ſurrender) and the fortifications viewed, amazement ſeized thoſe, who were hitherto ſtrangers to fear. Immediately upon their entering the city, (June 17, 1745) the clouds gathered blackneſs and poured down rains inceſſantly for ten days together.—This clos'd the ſcenes of wonder. The conqueſt of this place was very important in its conſequences and purchas'd the peace of Europe. "Cape-Breton was the ſingle equivalent for all the conqueſt of France in the Netherlands."—Though its reduction coſt but a few lives, yet many hundreds died, engariſoned there—Notwithſtanding the unſucceſsfulneſs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer attempts upon Canada, the reduction of that country was plann'd again by the miniſtry at home.

Every meaſure of defence was taken, that lay in our power. Heaven interpoſed for and delivered New-England—Inſtead of a Britiſh fleet to protect us, GOD was our defence. He who has all nature at his command, who kills and makes alive, ſent mortal ſickneſs among the enemy; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing their numbers, in ſuch a wonderful manner, that they were obliged to burn ſeveral of their ſhips for want of men to navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them.—Their General died on a ſudden; or as ſome ſay, laid violent hands on himſelf. Some of their ſhips were loſt in a violent ſtorm; others taken in their return. In this armament, near half the navy of France, was in a great meaſure deſtroyed.

proſperous and adverſe. Louiſbourg was inveſted and taken. The colonies exerted themſelves beyond their ſtrength. Near one fourth part of the militia in this colony went volunteers this year, into the army: which was repuls'd at Ticonderoga, with the loſs of about 2000 of the flower of the Britiſh troops kill'd, wounded or miſſing. How affecting was the ſpectacle when numbers of you, my dear friends, ſaw garments to I'd in human blood, and heard the dying groans of thoſe mortally wounded!—After this repulſe, Fronte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac, the enemies magazine, to ſupply their weſtern forts and ſavages to butcher our frontier-inhabitants, was taken. Their garriſon on the Ohio, was not long after deſerted, and our frontiers had general reſt.—Our military enterprizes were attended with glorious ſucceſs in 1759. Niagara was inveſted and taken: Oſwego ſaved from a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful attack made upon it. Thoſe forces that went to raiſe the ſiege of Niagara, were vanquiſh'd. This it is ſaid was when our army had juſt expended their ammunition, and muſt have raiſed their ſiege, had'nt the enemy come, who inſtead of accompliſhing their deſign, actually did quite the reverſe by ſupplying our army. At Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga but little reſiſtance was made—Crown-Point was deſerted—up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of the Lakes, Carillon, a place of great ſtrength and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was reduc'd, juſt before the abandoning of Crown-Point, which had ſo long been the ſcourge and terror of N.

To cloſe the military ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this year, the LORD of hoſts through a field of blood brought our army into the ſtrong city of <hi>Quebec,</hi> our enemies capital in this country, "a glorious, but coſtly victory!" <hi>Glorious</hi> as it was obtain'd by unequal numbers, with a firmneſs and reſolution ſcarcely to be equalled. <hi>Coſtly</hi> as it coſt the life of the renowned Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral WOLFE.

him live in all ſucceeding annals and ſhine in a full blaze of glory with a monument erected over his grave, more durable than ſtatues of braſs and marble. On the plains of Abraham a bloody and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive battle was fought—both the generals ſlain and the power of the French broken. The year enſuing (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 1760) brings us that glorious aera, which our fathers ardently deſired to ſee. Early this year the enemy made ſome ſmall attempts to ſave their country, but all to no purpoſe. GOD made inquiſition for blood in Canada, and would no longer ſuffer them to diſtreſs us. He, who led Iſrael thro the red ſea, on dry ground, and cauſed the waters of old Jordan to roll backward, bringing Iſrael from Egypt to Canaan by ſlow but ſure ſteps; He, through the watry avenues, led our armies into the enemy's country; while fear and dread fell upon them and their whole country was ſurrendered to the crown of Great-Britain. Thus Canada was conquer'd. Tribes and nations much greater than our fathers, have been driven out from before them and us to bring it to paſs as it is this day, when we conſider the many bloody wars they were obliged to engage in—the wants and diſtreſſes that ſurrounded them in their very infancy—the combined force of French and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, urged on by Popiſh <hi>legends</hi> and <hi>indulgencies:</hi> through what ſcenes of cruelty and bloodſhed hath the LORD of hoſts done theſe great things for us? <hi>We have heard with our ears, O</hi> GOD, <hi>our fathers have told us, what work thou did'ſt in their days, in the times of old: how thou did'ſt drive out the heathen.—They got not the land in poſſeſſion by their own ſtrength—but their how abode in ſtrength and their arms were ſtrengthened by the mighty</hi> GOD <hi>of Jacob.

            <p>THUS we have taken a very brief and general view of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſtreſſes which our fathers and the preſent generation, were neceſſarily obliged to engage in. What multitudes of heroic and loyal Americans have ſacrificed their lives for their country, and in obedience to royal mandates: many of whoſe bones are to this day whitening in the ſun. Their memory ſhould be embalm'd to the lateſt poſterity. At their own expence, the firſt planters undertook, ſupported and defended themſelves. For more than 120 years they received (as far as I can learn) not the leaſt parliamentary aids. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe, met with many diſcouragements from home, within that time, to damp the ſpirits of an infant plantation. <hi>Their help was in the name of the Lord. Had not the Lord been on their ſide, how often would their enemies have ſwallow'd them up,</hi> when their wrath was kindled againſt them. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to our enemies.</hi> We proceed briefly to conſider,</p>
            <p>III. OUR pecular obligations to know this day and conſider that the LORD he is GOD over all—and to keep his ſtatutes and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it may go well with us and our children, in the land which the LORD our GOD hath given us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:011595_0029_0F874594A5AA5580"/>
THE infinitely glorious GOD is infinitely worthy of our ſupreme regard. GOD'S glory is the nobleſt end we can propoſe; and God is glorified by us when we ſincerely keep his ſtatutes: therefore as reaſonable creatures, we are bound to this.—By the law of creation, GOD has a right to require this of us. As we received our all from GOD, ſo, we owe our all to GOD. All things are from GOD and ſhou'd be to him.—GOD is our continual preſerver—in him we live—therefore ſhou'd know and ſerve him. It is a reaſonable as well as commanded duty, that he who made and upholds us ſhou'd be glorified by us.—Mankind are alſo land under peculiar obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of conformity to GOD and devotedneſs to his ſervice, by the glorious proviſion heaven made for man's ſalvation after his apoſtacy from GOD—Here we might contemplate the unparallel'd wonders of redeeming love and grace—an incarnate GOD—<hi>how we were bought with the price of</hi> CHRIST'S <hi>blood, and are not our own: therefore we ſhou'd glorify</hi> GOD, <hi>in our bodies and ſpirits which are the</hi> LORD'S. The obligations thence ariſing are not peculiar to us, but common to all, who have heard of a Saviour. Therefore without enlargement here, we paſs on to ſome more particular conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD hath done wonderful things for us and our fathers. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey GOD'S marvellous works of wonder to New-England—the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances he has granted—the ſupports he has afforded—the deſigns of their enemies diſappointed—and was ever people, by a ſeries of remarkable providences, laid under ſtroger obligations to know, fear and ſerve the living GOD? For many years, with very ſnort intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they were involv'd in bloody and diſtreſſing wars, when they were, as yet, but few in number. Thoſe tragical ſcenes were acted over and over, with ſuch ſhocking inſtances of ſavage cruelty, that the mentioning of them is enough to chill the blood in every vein. How many of our anceſtors, who came into America, as an aſylum for liberty, have fallen ſacrifices to Pagan cruelty! How many little ones have had their brains daſhed our againſt the ſtones! Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our progenitors, through the good hand of GOD upon them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſurmounted all thoſe preſſing difficulties they had to encounter,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011595_0030_0F87459606AE7AD0"/>
and to which they appeared to be ſo unequal. GOD made way for them, by an awful mortality among the natives. Yet, multitudes all around ſurvived: nor did GOD ſuddenly cut them off. Their deſtruction was ſlow and gradual, but ſure. Every war they waged, every horrid conſpiracy they form'd, haſten'd their own deſtruction. In inſtances numberleſs divine providence protected. GOD'S people, watched over, interpoſed for and marvellouſly deliver'd them—N. England may ſay the LORD GOD omnipotent reigneth, and we have peculiar reaſon to rejoyce thereat.—While we tell theſe things to our children, as in duty bound, let cordial gratitude aſcend to the father of mercies, from an alter compoſed of the warmeſt and moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate hearts. While we are recollecting theſe things, can we help feeling peculiar obligations to love and ſerve the LORD, in truth and with all our heart, and to know that he is GOD?</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are under peculiar obligations to know and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve the LORD, as we live in a land of liberty, civil and religious. Liberty, fair offspring of heaven, engages ſome of the moſt ardent deſires of generous and noble ſouls. They bear the yoke of bondage with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, and caſt it from them as ſoon as opportunity preſents. An ardent thirſt for liberty inſpir'd our fathers, who ſled into the wilds of America to find an aſylum from thoſe uſurpations over the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, which then prevailed. Hopes of enjoying the ſweets of liberty, animated them to leave their pleaſant seats and fertile fields; to paſs the atlantic, to theſe then barbarous ſhores. Through innumerable perils and hardſhips they have tranſmitted to us this ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable bleſſing, which we at preſent enjoy in the fulleſt manner.—what more can be wiſhed for on civil or religious accounts. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, every one may judge for himſelf and worſhip GOD in that way, which he verily thinks his final Judge will approve.—The people may chuſe their own miniſters and methods for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, none may controul them.—As to civil affairs, our civil rulers are choſen by us. Every town is a corporation, yea, every family is a little kingdom. What more can be deſir'd or conceiv'd of? Theſe bleſſings indulg'd, demand ſuitable returns of gratitude and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011595_0031_0F8745969185A820"/>
to the GOD of our mercies. Peculiar bleſſings lay us under pecu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liar obligations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE are put under peculiar advantages to know GOD and that he is over all: therefore ſhou'd keep his ſtatutes.—We may not only read this important truth in thoſe large volumes of nature and providence; from the works of creation, and the common and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occurrences, of which we are ſpectators; but we have alſo the ſacred oracles to reach us. Therein God hath cauſed all his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to paſs before us. What heathens grope in the dark concerning and cannot unfold, but are fill'd with perplexing doubts reſpecting, is clearly reveal'd in the bible. All that ſuch beings as we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of knowing of GOD, is therein diſclos'd; even his communicable glory—and of man—his origin, fall, recovery, &amp;c. In the ſcriptures, GOD hath fully ſhewn that he is ſupreme governor in the natural and moral worlds. We have all conceivable advantages to know that the LORD he is GOD alone.—The end of knowledge is practice—conſequently advantages to know, lay us under obligations to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE have GOD'S ſtatutes and judgments: therefore muſt heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and obey. Heathens are inexcuſable for ſinning againſt the light of nature: <hi>not having the written law, they are a law to themſelves.</hi> But how much more inexcuſable are we, if, after having GOD'S law, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and judgments ſupernaturally reveal'd and publiſh'd from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we rebel againſt GOD? It will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha at the day of judgment than for us, if we ſin againſt ſuch diſtinguiſhing light, love and grace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. WE have GOD'S worſhip and ordinances among us, and thereby are under ſuperadded obligations to know GOD and live to him. Theſe are the ordinary and ſpecial means of grace heaven hath appointed for the ſalvation of fallen creatures. The love of CHRIST ſhould conſtrain us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. WE profeſs and acknowledge ourſelves to be GOD'S people, and enjoy all the privileges of ſuch. Therefore, are bound to fear and ſerve the LORD. So Iſrael of old were diſtinguiſhed; though
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011595_0032_0F874596EBADBF58"/>
not under the advantages we enjoy; yet of them GOD <hi>ſaid, if ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my law, diſregard my word and ordinances, I will ſell you into the bands of the heathens round about you and will puniſh all your iniquities; for you only have I known of all the families of the earth.</hi> Their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be greater than others, for they were GOD'S profeſſing people, ſtanding in a viſible covenant relation to the LORD—are we leſs ſo? Covenant vows and engagements are upon us. GOD'S com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and our own vows are too ſolemn and important to be trifled with. When the vows of GOD are upon you, dare you tranſgreſs? Is not the obligation too ſacred to be violated? Will any plead, to extenuate their guilt, that they have not publicly and explicitly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into covenant with GOD? Were you not devoted to GOD, by baptiſm in early life? Have you not been inſtructed, counſel'd, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admoniſhed, as being a child of the covenant, being followed with <hi>line upon line precept upon precept?</hi>—Was you never in wracking diſtreſs or imminent danger? Under thoſe circumſtances, did'nt you cry to GOD, mingling vows with your tears, that if GOD would deliver you, the reſidue of your days ſhou'd be devoted to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? The LORD heard and delivered you; whereby he hath bound down your vows upon you. Wherefore your guilt in the violation of them, remains before GOD. How will you anſwer it to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day, if you violate theſe ſolemn obligations you are under to conſecrate your time, talents and all to GOD? GOD has laid his people under ſtill ſtronger obligations to keep his ſtatutes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments by promiſing glorious rewards to thoſe that love and ſerve him; and by threatning eternal woe and miſery to the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All the joys of heaven are ſet before us, to animate us to our duty; and all the horrors of everlaſting burnings, to deter us from iniquity.—GOD may ſay to us, what more could have been done, that I have not done for you?—Once more, as we may, in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to GOD'S glory, have reſpect to our own and our childrens comfort here and hereafter; ſo this is mentioned in our text as an inducement and obligation to ſerve the LORD—<hi>that it may go well
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011595_0033_0F84597C652F520"/>
with thee and with thy children—in the land which the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD <hi>giveth thee, forever.</hi> That we may enjoy the ſmiles of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in this world, and be late received to eternal reſt. Yea, and that it may go well with our children after us—That when we ſhall be laid in our graves, having nothing more to do with things te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial, but ſhall be immutably fixed in eternity: then our poſterity may dwell in this land, ſurrounded with the bleſſings of heaven—and that we and they may finally meet together in the kingdom of heaven.—Theſe things may ſhow us ſome of our peculiar obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be the LORD'S.</p>
            <p>IV. TO ENUMERATE ſome of thoſe ſins, which will (if indulged) provoke GOD to deſtroy thoſe who have been diſtinguiſh'd as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of heaven. In general, we may obſerve, contempt of GOD and religion, tempting CHRIST and deſpiſing goſpel grace, are things which GOD abhors and the procuring cauſes of divine judgments.—Eſpecially if theſe prevail, may be expected to be ſo to New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; whoſe fathers came hither to eſcape thoſe ſins, or rather to eſcape perſecution for the contrary virtues.</p>
            <p n="1">1. INDIFFERENCY about religion, muſt be peculiarly provoking to GOD; when this temper prevails among the inhabitants of this land, for whom GOD hath. done ſuch wonderful things.—What ſhou'd be moſt is by many leaſt cared for. As religion includes acquaintance with GOD &amp; conformity to him, it is matter of the laſt importance and concern to mankind. Yet how much is it diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—the goſpel deſpiſed, and how few <hi>ſeek firſt the kingdom of GOD and the righteouſneſs thereof!</hi> Moſt inexcuſably guilty are thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd in point of privilege, if they deſpiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. PROFANATION of GOD'S holy ſabbath, is another ſin, which will provoke GOD to deſtroy thoſe who have been diſtinguiſh'd as the favourites of heaven. GOD hath ſet apart and ſanctified one ſeventh part of time for himſelf, On this day we may not <hi>ſpeak
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011595_0034_0F87459925528508"/>
our own words, think our own thoughts, nor find our own pleaſures.</hi>—Where no conſcientious regard is paid to the ſabbath, there can be no true religion. Reaſon and experience teach us that the religious obſervation of the LORD's day, with a ſerious attendance upon the word, ſacraments and prayer, muſt have a powerful influence on the lives of chriſtians. Religion flouriſhes or declines among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the ſabbath is regarded or profaned.—GOD is provoked, when his ſabbath's are profaned and public worſhip neglected. Of old, the indignation of the Almighty was determin'd againſt thoſe who trampled under foot the ſacred law of the ſabbath. Six days are allowed us for our employments; what ſacrilege to rob GOD of the ſeventh!</p>
            <p>SOME of our anceſtors ſell under the tokens of royal diſpleaſure becauſe they wou'd not read the book of ſports and games, on the LORD's day, for perſons to go to gaming and diverſions after pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip; which was the edict of K. CHARLES the firſt, who is kept ſo much in remembrance—But for us to pretend ſuch ſports are right, would be to riſe up in oppoſition to the good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome laws of our land and nation; yea more—the laws of GOD, the ſupreme King.—No diverſions, worldly diſcourſes, trifling viſits, reading romances or the like may be allowed of upon GOD's holy day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SERIOUS and devout attendance on the ordinances of the goſpel is requir'd; and when theſe are either neglected or proſtituted, the great inſtitutor is highly provoked. By many, theſe ordinances are totally neglected,—This is become too faſhionable. Doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard to divine ordinances, argue diſregard to CHRIST, and too great indifferency about the ſalvation of our ſouls? If this be owing to the careleſs, irreligious lives of the profeſſors of chriſtianity, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are doubly guilty. But who dare entertain a low eſteem of thoſe ordinances CHRIST appointed as with his dying breath. A general omiſſion argues, at leaſt, coldneſs in religion and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011595_0035_0F874599EFF995F0"/>
infidelity of heart. By a ſolemn profeſſion, 'tis true, perſons lay themſelves under the neceſſity of a circumſpect life, or diſhonour themſelves by having their practice give the lye to their profeſſion. Let all in their reſpective places ſeriouſly conſider theſe things and exert themſelves to the utmoſt of their power, to wipe away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach caſt upon the glorious REDEEMER and his ordinances. Let the baptized ſeriouſly conſider their obligations—and let all that love the LORD JESUS, cry mightily unto GOD, that he would be graciouſly pleaſed to pour out his ſpirit plentifully and cauſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to fly to CHRIST and attend his ordinances, the neglect of which muſt be provoking to the Almighty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. AWFUL neglect of church diſcipline, is another thing diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven. CHRIST appointed church diſcipline for the good of mankind. When ſcandalous perſons are not diſciplin'd, but there are ways to eſcape goſpel cenſure, by ſome means or other; this is a threatening ſymptom. When baptized perſons are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as under the obligations of the covenant, nor educated and diſciplined as children of the covenant.—To have the riſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration grow up in profligacy and diſſoluteneſs of manners, without religious principles impreſſed upon their conſciences, is one of the moſt ill-boding prognoſtics.</p>
            <p n="5">5. PROFANENESS—cuſtomary and habitual ſwearing are ſins of a crimſon dye, and will not fail to incenſe the DEITY. The prophet Jeremiah declared in the name of the LORD, that, <hi>becauſe of ſwearing the land mourned.</hi> When our fathers came into this country, a man who had lived here for ſeven years, on his return to Old England, declared that during this ſpace, he never heard a profane oath, nor ſaw a man drunk. How are the times changed! the late war ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved greatly to corrupt the morals of many youth, and ſpread pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs through this continent. This ſin provokes GOD, without pleaſing one of the ſenſes. It is a taſteleſs, fruitleſs ſin—an horrid
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011595_0036_0F87459A9E6B1048"/>
perverſion of the uſe of ſpeech, which is a ſort of miracle in nature. Are youth ſuitably watch'd counſel'd, admoniſh'd, and when guilty puniſhed? If our air be tainted with the language of hell, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we feel the judgments of heaven. By ſome in our land, is not the tremendous name of Almighty GOD toſs'd, wantonly and blaſphemouſly toſs'd upon their impious tongues? The LORD will not hold them guiltleſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. INTEMPERANCE is another ſin provoking to GOD, and very pernicious to mankind. It is ſuch an enemy to all that is virtuous, decent or religious that all mankind ſhou'd riſe up with utmoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt it. This expoſes to every other ſin—brings a train of calamities—deſtroys the conſtitution here, and the ſoul fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver—drives away GOD'S holy ſpirit—unfits for religious exerciſes—waſtes the eſtate—benumbs the ſenſes—ſtupifies conſcience—diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours GOD, and will procure an inundation of divine wrath. When perſons act as though they would drink up Jordon at a draught, and all the ſpiritous liquors in the weſtern iſles, cannot ſlake their thirſt; yea, and are ready to bleſs themſelves in their hearts, ſaying, we ſhall have peace though we walk in the imagination of our heart, adding drunkenneſs to thirſt, then their deſtruction is nigh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable—For reaſonable man, who is a candidate for heaven, to part with his reaſon, his conſcience, his GOD and heaven, for a few ſenſual draughts, which only tend to his ſhame and miſery here, as well as torment hereafter, is a moſt deſperate pitch of fully and madneſs,—Yea, for thoſe who ſwim in rivers of GOD'S goodneſs, thus to abuſe the bounties of heaven, in ſome reſpects, exceeds the ſins of devils. Such an horrid abuſe of the bleſſings of heaven, throwing them as in the face of the donor, the damn'd have no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for.—When once the appetite has got the aſcendecy of a perſon, he is in a fearfully dangerous ſtate: and finding this to be the caſe, ought immediately to mortify his appetite, by an utter renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of all ſuch intoxicating ſpirits, as he would hope for heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:011595_0037_0F87459BA20C7DE0"/>
O my friends theſe vices call for the united force and oppoſition of miniſters and magiſtrates, houſholders, informing officers and all that wiſh the proſperity of mankind. Ariſe and excert yourſelves to avert impending ruin. For by reaſon of theſe things, where they abound without controul the righteous judgments of GOD come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a land, 'til it be made a reproach and a deſolation.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, neglect of family prayer is another GOD provoking abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. If there be one prayerleſs family belonging to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; remember, GOD in his word, ranks thoſe with heathen, upon whom he will pour forth his fury.—This ſhall be the portion of all thoſe who neglect a duty ſo important.—Here I might mention the ſins of lying, ſlandering, backbiting, neglect of family govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and education of children—Idleneſs, uncleanneſs, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, covetouſneſs, envy, ſelf-ſeeking, malice, contention, uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, revellings, chambering and wantonneſs, with too many other ſins to be particularly mentioned, each of which ſingly, is ſufficient and all of them collectively conſidered, will not fail (if indulged) to pull down the judgments of heaven upon an highly privileged people.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, when ſtupid ſecurity and amazing inſenſibility poſſeſs the minds of men, who are under moſt peculiar obligations to be the LORD's—When they are not awaken'd to righteouſneſs and true holineſs by awful rebukes, ſignal mercies and the precious means of grace, they ſtand, upon ſcripture record, mark'd out for judgment, according to their reſpective ſins. <hi>Wo to them that are at eaſe in Zion,</hi> who live ſecure in ſin, boaſting of their privileges and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation to GOD. <hi>crying the temple of the</hi> LORD. The LORD will come ſuddenly and unexpectedly upon thoſe who <hi>have a name to live and are dead.</hi> If Laodicean lukewarmneſs take place, and mankind are eaſy without the life and power of godlineſs; they are ſo offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the LORD JESUS that he will ſpue them out of his mouth. If

the profligate and abandoned <hi>bleſs themſelves in their heart, ſaying they ſhall have peace though they live in their ſins; there ruin is near. He that being often reproved hardneth his neck ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed and that without remedy.</hi>—Muſt it not be peculiarly provoking to GOD, to ſee his people remiſs and careleſs under his ſolemn and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goings? If <hi>ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, ſaith the LORD of hoſts, I will even ſend &amp; curſe upon you, and I will curſe your bleſſings.</hi>—Notwithſtanding the various bleſſings of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven indulged us, and a ſeries of remarkable providences by which GOD hath brought it to paſs as it is this day.—Yet, <q>we, in this Colony, have reaſon to be ſeriouſly affected with the teſtimonies of divine providence, in the paſt year, againſt our ſins and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Particularly in removing by death, our very worthy and honourable governor PITKIN. He is no more.</q> 
               <hi>Having ſerved his generation, according to the will of</hi> GOD, <hi>he fell aſleep.</hi>—His pious counſels and example cease.—May we always have thoſe to rule over us, who fear GOD, and are faſt friends to the civil and religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <q>DIVINE diſpleaſure is alſo teſtified againſt us, in diſappointing our hopes of relief from the burthens laid upon us, and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning proſpect of the continuance of our diſtreſſes. As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If capital vices are indulged and a people remain ſtupidly ſecure, under thoſe advantages, motives and obligations to holineſs; Almighty

               <p n="1">1. HAVE our fathers been carried through ſo many perils and hardſhips—supported under ſo many trials and diſcouragements? We may ſee, admire and adore the good hand of GOD upon them. GOD made them his ſpecial care—delivered them, and will deliver us alſo, if we will cleave to the LORD, truſting in him. The Moſt High has gloriouſly owned the cauſe of liberty, in New-England, and will continue to own it, unleſs we ſo abuſe, as to ſin away our privileges. GOD hath made the wilderneſs bloſſom as a roſe, and ſolitary places to ſing and rejoyce. Admire the diſpenſations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence in gradually cutting off the heathen—making room for us—causing the land to ſpue out the barbarous nations, as they grew ripe for ruin. How ſtrangely have they waſted away 'til they almoſt diſappear? Many are the wars they have engaged in, and obliged our anceſtors to be involv'd in: various conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies have been form'd by them: every of which, eventually haſten'd their own ruin. In what unexpected and marvellous ways hath

GOD apppeared for our anceſtors I once when they were juſt ready to ſtarve, having appointed a day of faſting and prayer; a few days before the time appointed therefor, GOD ſent a veſſel laden with proviſions to them, and they turned the faſt into a thankſgiving. It is impoſſible to relate or even conceive the difficulties and diſtreſſes they ſtruggled with; or the mercies and deliverances they experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced. Now GOD hath given us peaceably to enjoy the fruit of their labour: can we help feeling ourſelves under peculiar obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to love and ſerve the GOD of our fathers. <q>Fear the LORD and ſerve him in truth, with all your heart, for conſider what great things he hath done for you.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. HENCE <hi>ſee the wonderful goodneſs and awful ſeverity of</hi> GOD. Goodneſs to our fathers; defending them—<hi>becauſe he loved them and thoſe their ſeed .</hi> Shall this marvellous goodneſs of GOD—theſe numerous mercies be abuſed by their poſterity? <q>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance and long ſuffering; not knowing that the goodneſs of GOD leadeth thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? But, after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up unto thyſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of GOD.</q> Affronts offered to goodneſs and mercy are moſt provoking and aggravated. Of all men we are then moſt inexcuſable, if we rebel againſt GOD. Hath GOD dealt ſo with any people as with us and our fathers? Our frontiers, which have ſo long been expoſed to the moſt horrid barbarities of mercileſs ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, are now become peaceable habitations.—How amazingly does the country populate! The inhabitants enlarge their borders almoſt from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the ends of the earth—When recollecting the hiſtory hereof, it ſhou'd be our chief view and aim to diſcover the greatneſs and glory of the works of GOD. To diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his providential operations, is a ſin of the deepeſt dye. None but the moſt ſtupid or abandoned of mankind, will be guilty of ſuch infatuation.</p>
               <p>GOD's awful ſeverity is alſo held up to view in this diſcourſe—ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity upon the heathens, whom the LORD hath wonderfully dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n ſhed and deſtroyed, their name and memory is almoſt periſhed from the earth. <hi>Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall we be thought worthy, if we trample, as under our feet, the Son of GOD, and count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, doing deſpite to the ſpirit of grace?

their deſtruction, we have an awful example of GOD's juſtice to alarm us. When we conſider the numerous tribes GOD has deſtroyed—how they have periſhed:—that if we ſin, it is at a dearer rate than they have done—and as our ſins will be more aggravated ſo will our puniſhment—if thoſe died without mercy what will be our doom? We ſhall periſh from off this good land—and ſink into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery infinitely deeper and more dreadful than we can conceive of. Fear as well as love ſhould excite us to ſerve the LORD. Theſe are powerful motives of action in the human mind, and ſhou'd this day have their influence on our minds—numberleſs are the motives, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath eſpecially ſet before us, to excite us to a conſcientious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of duty. If we have any regard for the glory of GOD, our own comfort here and hereafter, or for our tender offspring and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, we muſt ſerve the LORD. We cannot plead, to extenuate our guilt, that we have not known our LORD's will, as revealed by his word and wonderful works. Thoſe heathen, whom GOD hath driven out from before us, will riſe up in judgment againſt us, if we live without GOD and CHRIST in the world, deſpiſing goſpel light and grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. WHAT an ungrateful part do thoſe act, who live in comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances, in conſequence of thoſe hardſhips and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> them! If they are ſo ignorant, that knowledge of the truth don't teach them better; yet filial piety ſhou'd check their impious tongues. How indecent and undutiful for children to riſe up and load with reproach, the names and memory of thoſe, to whom under GOD they are indebted for their exiſtence and numberleſs mercies and bleſſings they enjoy. It is impious in any, to reproach thoſe, who have given ſuch illuſtrious demonſtrations of their riſing ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the moſt diſcouraging obſtacles, <q>ſurmounting perils and want, toil and famine, and the ſword of the wilderneſs.</q>—After ſuch ſignal interpoſitions of heaven in their behalf;—after having left behind them ſuch a ſweet memorial, (more than a brazen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument) of the ſincerity of their profeſſion—after all this, their aſhes ſhou'd remain undiſturbed by any: but for their poſterity to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their memories with reproaches, is ſuch complicated, God-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, heaven-daring, ſoul-ruining, land-defiling and deteſtable a ſin as wants a name.—Did our pious and venerable anceſtors forſake

houſes, lands and the moſt tender connections, with <q>every thing dear and eſtimable amongſt human kind, for the undiſturbed fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of the rights of private judgment, ſacred by the laws of GOD and nature.</q>—Let us adore GOD who ſupported them, and walk worthy the deſcendants of ſuch pious and illuſtrious anceſtors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. LET us lament the crying ſins of the preſent day. America was ſought at firſt and ſettled, as an aſylum for liberty civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. Regard for GOD, religion and liberty brought our forefathers hither: and how ſtrict were they in family religion and government—in attendance upon public worſhip and goſpel ordinances: and in all their moral behaviour—profaneneſs and intemperance were not practiſed by them. But alas! how are the times changed! GOD hath put us into the quiet poſſeſſion of this land; though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is not as we could wiſh; yet we are freed from thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes they endured. Do we walk humbly and thankfully before and with our GOD? Doth not iniquity abound and the love of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wax cold? What diviſions in church and ſtate? Some wou'd ſubject themſelves to that yoke which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear. Our privileges, favours and bleſſings are dear bought. They may be look'd upon and prized by us, as flowing to us, in that crimſon tide, which guſhed from the great IMMANUEL'S veins. Shall we dare to ſin away thoſe precious privileges, which our glorious REDEEMER expended his blood to procure?—We may alſo look upon theſe privileges as handed down to us, through the blood of our <hi>fore-fathers.</hi> How inexcuſably and aggravatedly guilty are the inhabitants of this land, if they refuſe or neglect to know and ſerve the LORD GOD of their fathers. Did the firſt <hi>planters,</hi> from before whom GOD drove out the Aboriginals, appear in any thing, to be over-rigid and ſevere, as if they retained ſomething of that old leaven of perſecution from which they fled? Yet, certainly their general character was that of <hi>eminently pious chriſtians.</hi> Looſe principles and looſe practices are too prevalent with the preſent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Are theſe the deſcendants of thoſe noble worthies? How degenerate!</p>
               <p>FINALLY, let us break off our ſins by repentance and return to GOD through JESUS CHRIST. We have dangerous and threatening ſymptoms upon us; among which this is one. that ſome appear to ſet light by thoſe ineſtimable privileges of a civil and religious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011595_0043_0F8745A21EA18998"/>
which we enjoy, <hi>Remember from whence we are fallen, repent and do the firſt works</hi>—Begin at home firſt. Mankind are apt to ſay ſuch and ſuch are vile: there is a profane perſon; there is a ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath breaker, or an intemperate wretch, . Begin with thyſelf.—Which of the divine commands have you not broken, in thought, word or deed, and are daily breaking? Hereby thou doſt bear apart, in pulling down, as with violent hands, the vengeance of heaven. Let every one repent, ſaying what have I done? <hi>Fear</hi> GOD <hi>and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the King.</hi> We muſt know GOD ſo as to love and ſerve him, as an holy, juſt and righteous being: conſecrating our time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>Now is the accepted time and now the day of ſalvation. Yet a little while, and he that shall come, will come and will not tarry.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is juſt before us. Our fathers, who firſt ſettled this country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>where are they?</hi> Having ſerved their generation, according to the will of GOD, they are fallen aſleep. We muſt quickly lie down alike in the duſt—Let us live as pilgrims and ſtrangers here—ſeeking an heavenly country—as people profeſſing godlineſs and under the beſt advantages and ſtrongeſt obligations to practiſe that righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation. Wherefore repent and be converted.—<q>In point of duty, gratitude and intereſt, we are under infinite obligations to love GOD and live to him. God is infinitely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our ſupreme love and entire obedience, as he is by nature GOD.</q> And every motive from heaven, earth and hell conſpires to urge duty upon us. To continue in ſin, is to deſpiſe GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> CHRIST and heavenly joys; yea, and to be ſtupid to our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent intereſt and comfort. Abandon a I ſin—ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith CHRIST hath, made us free. Abuſe not thoſe precious privileges—may GOD continue them and we perpetuate the memory of them—May we, through grace, educate here for a bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; tranſmitting to poſterity, this fair inheritance and theſe privileges unimpair'd. When we are gathered to our fathers, may there be here a generation to ſerve the LORD: and when CHRIST who is the believers life, ſhall appear to judge the world, with all his ſaints around him, may we appear with him in glory.</p>
