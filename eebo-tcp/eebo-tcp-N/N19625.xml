      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I. Concerning the Deſign of the following Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—Epiſtle to the Reader.</head>
               <p>THO the following hiſtory ſhould be found to contain no remarkable events to amaze the reader, yet it may lead him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the progreſſive ſteps whereby others have ariſen from obſcure poverty, and diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous conditions, to eaſy circumſtances. Tho no political ſtruggles will arreſt his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no tragical ſcenes convulſe his heart, yet a ſympathetic ſigh may heave his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous breaſt, while he follows an individual ſtruggling with difficulties which for a time ſeem inſurmountable.</p>
               <p>

Hiſtories may detail the waſteful ſcenes of war; or celebrate, in poliſhed periods, the glories of victory and conqueſt; or deſcribe the riſe and fall of ſtates and kingdoms.—I aim not at ſcenes like theſe—Be it mine to write of worth, to detail tranſactions, and unfold virtues which dignify human nature, and extend the bleſſings of ſociety. I ſhall endeavor uſefully to amuſe a winter's even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or profitably fill up a vacant hour, by the recital of thoſe means whereby that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſucceſsfully ſtruggled with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon difficulties, and roſe to a degree of worth and conſequence, that might excite the envy of little minds, but would provoke the emulation of more noble ſpirits.</p>
               <p>The conſequence he gained was not owing to the caprice of fortune, but to the natural operations of well directed induſtry, uniform ſobriety and virtue. The reader will follow the incidents of fortune attending his early days, the progreſs and means of his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the events that led to his ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent condition. He will ſee an outcaſt orphan floating on a boiſterous ocean, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a friendly hand extended to his relief, directing his little bark to a peaceful ſhore. He will obſerve the efforts of genius making improvements without means, and gaining
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025609_0013_0FCE0FF98079A4A0"/>
rank in ſociety without friends. He will mark the firſt eſſays of induſtry encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rude wilderneſs, and follow its ſteady operations, until he ſees the recumbent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bloſſoming as a roſe, and the quiet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor enjoying all the pleaſures of domeſtic life, purſuing rural occupations, and inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fruits of his well earned property in the evening ſhades of life.</p>
               <p>To delineate the ſeveral parts of a good character, and conſider the means that led to the eſtabliſhment of it, is no leſs agreeable than uſeful. To obſerve the dawnings of genius, and notice the efforts of a well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed mind to gain knowledge, worth and eſteem, opens to us the avenues leading to them. To poſſeſs theſe in the humble cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or ſcanty tenement, affords the poſſeſſor more pleaſure than all the extenſive poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the haughty landlord, who is deſpiſed by the diſcerning, and deteſted by his cring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervile dependents. To enjoy the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem of others, is deſirable; but to deſerve it, muſt give exquiſite pleaſure.</p>
               <p>In order to merit the eſteem of others, we muſt become acquainted with the duties of our particular profeſſions, occupations or ſtations in life, and diſcharge the duties of them in the moſt uſeful and agreeable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025609_0014_0FCE0FFAD91D7950"/>
He who poſſeſſes real worth may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expect the inward homage of the heart, even tho he does not receive external marks of reſpect from others; for true dignity of character does not conſiſt in riches, nor in any of thoſe diſtinctions of rank in ſociety which command external reſpect. In the preſent ſtate of human affairs, men may riſe to places in civil ſociety which ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this external reſpect, with very little perſonal merit. Their elevation is ſo far from dignifying their character, that it makes their want of real dignity but the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. The man of real worth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is eſteemed for his perſonal qualities.</p>
               <p>If he diſtinguiſhes himſelf as the head of a well regulated family, or as a kind and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neighbor, he as really poſſeſſes preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of character as he whoſe virtues are made more conſpicuous by reaſon of his having a more extenſive field to diſplay them in. The man who ſhines for a while in ſome dazzling qualities, unfounded in virtue, will, like the falling meteor, ſink into obſcurity, while the man of real and ſolid worth lives in the grateful memory of man, when he can no longer exert his virtues for their good—Still they eſteem, ſtill they venerate his character. The public eſteem and reſpect

               <p>If the reader ſhould find any amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an evening in the following ſheets, the writer will feel himſelf much gratified. If the reader acquire no new ideas, nor any uſeful impreſſions, let him aſk himſelf who is in fault. Let him conſider for whoſe improvement they were written, and that will ſuggeſt all the apology the writer wiſhes both for the ſtyle and manner in which they appear. If he is not diſcouraged in the peruſal of a few pages, he will in ſome parts of the narrative ſee the ſmiles of new born happineſs, the gladſome harveſt inſpiring the cheerful ſong, and the glow of manly pride excited by riſing wealth and independence.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the Parentage of Charles Worthy—why called Poor Charles—the Death of his Father—the Cruelty of an oppreſſive Neighbor.</head>
               <p>CHARLES Worthy was the eldeſt ſon of Mr. George Worthy, who lived in the town of B—, a large and reſpectable town in the county of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Tho he was poor, yet he was induſtrious and virtuous. He never repined at his ſituation, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to get as good a ſupport for his family as his health would permit; and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he fared hard, yet he would often ſay, with pious ſubmiſſion—"It is better than I deſerve." His wife was a very meek, pious woman, and was contented with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. She made the beſt of every thing he brought home. She never had occaſion to reproach him either with neglect, or with waſting what he earned; nor did ſhe fret and repine, as many do, becauſe ſhe had not ſuch things as ſhe wiſhed for, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was ſometimes deſtitute even of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Her heart was ſometimes ready to burſt with grief, when her children cried
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025609_0017_0FCE1001CAE45480"/>
for bread, and ſhe had none to give them. But ſhe would comfort herſelf with this thought, "God will never leave nor forſake them who truſt in him;" that "he will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the faithful poor with bread." She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed her children as well as ſhe was able, and clothed them by her induſtry. Altho Mr. Worthy was not able to do as much for the ſupport of his family as many poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on account of his feeble conſtitution, yet he was kind to his wife, and affectionate in his conduct towards his children. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, as it endeared him to his family, rendered his death the more afflicting to them, eſpecially as it was occaſioned by an act of great cruelty.</p>
               <p>It was very unfortunate for Mr. Worthy, that the little ſpot of land he owned joined to one of thoſe unfeeling wretches who ſeem to delight in grinding the face of the poor. This oppreſſive man was an overgrown farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who had grown rich upon the ſpoils of thoſe who fell into his debt. This poor man had been obliged to take of him ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for his family, at a time when he was unable to work. Tho the amount was but ſmall, yet he could not pay it when demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was thrown into priſon, by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs creditor, in the winter. The great
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025609_0018_0FCE10032758E040"/>
diſtreſs of mind occaſioned by the ſituation of his family, together with a violent cold, threw him into a fever, of which he died in about ten days.</p>
               <p>That which added much to the diſtreſs of his afflicted widow, was, ſhe found it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to part with her children to ſuch places as could be procured for them. But her eldeſt ſon, being able to afford her a little aſſiſtance, remained with her, and being a very dutiful child, was a great comfort to his mother. He helped to ſupport her, both by his labor, and by going to aſk alms of ſome of the neighbors, whoſe charitable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition contributed much to his mother's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport. Charles behaved himſelf in ſo modeſt and clever a manner on all occaſions, and eſpecially when he applied to any one for aſſiſtance, that he was known in all the neighborhood by the name of POOR CHARLES; for every one who knew him, loved and pitied him, except that hard hearted man who thruſt his father into priſon, and was ſo vexed that he could not get Charles into his ſervice, that he took every opportunity to afflict his poor mother. There are ſome people who ſeem to think that the earth was created for them alone, and that they have a right to the ſervice of every one
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025609_0019_0FCE1005A3E97F28"/>
on whom they can lay their hands; and therefore will wring the laſt farthing from their poor neighbors, without any regard to their diſtreſſes, or the calls of a dependent family.</p>
               <p>Poor Charles, tho meanly clothed, was always clean, and was a very promiſing boy. It was fortunate for him that he had been uſed to work from his infancy, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſtrong healthy boy. He had a great deſire to learn; and tho he had little op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity at ſchool, yet his mind kept pace with his body. It was a great grief to him that he could not go to ſchool and learn, as many other boys did. But his mother, to whom he continued to pay all dutiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, obſerving his great eagerneſs to learn, was careful to inſtruct him in reading by the dim torch that glimmered in her ſolitary abode in the evening. She had been well taught in her early days, and, being a pious woman, had cultivated her mind as much as her ſituation would admit of, in the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of letters as well as of religious truth. In both of theſe reſpects ſhe endeavored to communicate to her ſon. In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this poor woman began to promiſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſome comfort in having a ſon ſo dutiful and amiable to continue with her. But alas,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025609_0020_0FCE1006D49E4648"/>
how often are we diſappointed in that on which we ſeemed moſt to rely!</p>
               <p>The diſtreſſes and diſappointments of this poor woman are not yet at an end. They had been many and great, from various cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. But that which reduced her to the laſt extremity, and indeed was thought to haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her to the grave, was the further cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of that oppreſſive neighbor, in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away her cow, to ſatiſfy a demand which ſhe had every reaſon to believe her poor huſband had laboured to diſcharge while living. But as there were no legal evidence of it, the cow muſt go to ſatiſfy the demand. This cow was purchaſed by the ſavings they had ſqueezed out of their little earnings, and came lowing at the door every night to ſupply them with a plenty of milk. This uſeful and neceſſary creature was taken from her at a time when her health required the enjoyment of it. But neither the tears of the diſtreſſed widow, nor the cries of Poor Charles, whoſe little heart was ready to burſt on the occaſion, could procure any lenity from this haughty unfeeling man.</p>
               <p>This circumſtance deprived her of the little remains of domeſtic pleaſure ſhe had till now enjoyed. As moſt of the little furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhe had went with the cow, and her
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025609_0021_0FCE10084EC8FD08"/>
health was declining, ſhe began to think of a place for her ſon, and to caſt herſelf upon the public for a ſupport. This was a moſt grievous thing indeed to her. But being a pious woman, ſhe endeavoured patiently to ſubmit to her condition. As every thing on earth looked dark and gloomy, ſhe drew her conſolation from the proſpects of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance fairer than any that the world could afford. Firmly relying on the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and equity of Divine Providence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dark and myſterious in ſome of its operations, ſhe cheerfully committed herſelf and her children to the care of their heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly Father; and, "having caſt anchor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vail," ſhe reſolved to outride all the ſtorms and tempeſts that beat on this boiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous ſhore.</p>
               <p>I would only remark here, that a bad neighbor is one of the greateſt peſts inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our ſocial ſtate. The unavoidable intercourſe of people of the ſame neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood makes their enjoyment of life very dependent on each other. When therefore an individual diſturbs the peace of thoſe about him, and vexes thoſe whoſe quiet and happineſs he ſhould ſtudy, he becomes an object of hatred, perhaps of dread and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025609_0022_0FCE100B0CF93E48"/>
to all about him. This was truly the caſe with this cruel neighbor. He was beloved by none, hated by moſt, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by all; for he was troubleſome to all around him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. The Death of Charles' Mother—His Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Mr. Gruff's—his fortunate Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from that old Churl's.</head>
               <p>IT was not long before the death of Poor Charles' mother, that a diſtant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who lived in the town of F—, was paſſing that part of the country where they lived, and hearing of their ſituation, called to inquire after their welfare—or, what is more probable, to procure a likely boy for his own convenience, for he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of Charles' good character. This is too often all the charity that actuates peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in taking orphan children. They have their own ends to anſwer; and when that is done, little elſe is cared for. How few are there who conſider the helpleſs ſtate of ſuch children, and treat them with the tenderneſs which humanity and chriſtian charity dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate! The language of common conduct is—"They are poor, and if taught to labor well, that is enough. If they learn to read and to write, it is well—if not, it is no matter: As to their morals, let them take care of themſelves." This is the practical
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025609_0024_0FCE100E87020588"/>
language of their guardians. But when they aſſume the name of guardians, let them act in character. If ſuch children are fed and clothed well, they will do the more ſervice. If well inſtructed, they will be the more uſeful; and if their morals are well guarded, they will be the more faithful. Ragged clothes, hard knocks, and hungry bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, too often conſtitute the charity ſhown to orphan children.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was Poor Charles' mother bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied, than he began to experience the kind of charity his patron had in view.</p>

               <p>He was put to hard labor, and kept inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly at it. He was meanly clad, and not much better fed. No generous maſter would have put a ſlave to the ſevere drudgery that was demanded of Charles. A boy of ſo cheerful a diſpoſition, and ſo ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do every thing he was called to, ought to be encouraged and kindly treated. But when men are influenced by no motives but perſonal intereſt, or capricious paſſions, the moſt obedient and faithful of thoſe under them often fare worſt. This was literally true in the caſe of Charles; for the more he endeavoured to pleaſe, the more he was abuſed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conceal the real name of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as I wiſh to expoſe his baſeneſs as a warning to others, rather than his name as a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025609_0026_0FCE101454BC0390"/>
reproach to his ſurviving friends. That which affected Poor Charles the moſt, was, that Mr. Richard Gruff, for ſo I ſhall call him, would allow him no time for learning, on which his heart was very much ſet. Mr. Gruff was a wealthy farmer, in the town of F—, and county of M—. He was one of thoſe churliſh beings, who, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy any thing in life themſelves, will not ſuffer thoſe about them to have any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. He thought it uſeleſs to give his children much learning; and much leſs did he regard the education of a charity boy. Charles was therefore defeated in all his attempts to get learning. His good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition recommended him to every one who knew him except to Mr. Gruff, who ſeemed to be inſenſible to any thing gentle and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Indeed the marks of genius which he diſcovered, ſurprized many people who knew him. Already had he learned to read, tho but poorly, under the care of his moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. So that when he could get any little books from the children of the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, who loved him on account of his good diſpoſition, he would read them whenever he could find any opportunity. This procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him many a ſcolding, and ſometimes a ſevere whipping from Mr. Gruff, who could
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025609_0027_0FCE1015E682B808"/>
ſee no advantage from boys reading "worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs books," as he called them.</p>
               <p>No arguments could prevail on this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, hard hearted man, to give Charles an opportunity at ſchool to learn writing and arithmetic, tho he was growing faſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan now to be a large boy, and rendered Mr. Gruff great ſervice. This grieved Charles to the heart, and often made him aſhamed when in company with other boys. As he ſaw no probability of ſucceeding in his wiſhes by entreaty, he determined to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it by his own ingenuity and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Having no materials to begin with, and not being able to procure any of Mr. Gruff, nor money to purchaſe them, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed a trap to catch quails and other game, that he might raiſe money to procure them himſelf. In the neighborhood of Mr. Gruff there lived a very worthy family by the name of Heathorn. This family had been very kind to Charles, and ſeemed to compaſſionate his caſe. This was a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate circumſtance for Charles, for when he caught ſome game, he applied to Mr. Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn to ſend them to market the next time his man went, and to have the effects laid out in paper and an arithmetic book. Ink he could make himſelf from maple bark boiled
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025609_0028_0FCE101A11F584D8"/>
with a little copperas, and quills he could gather without expenſe. At the time Mr. Heathorn's man was to return from market, Charles went over in the duſk of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, high fraught with expectation from the ſucceſs of the adventure. What then muſt have been his ſurprize and mortification, when he was informed that, by an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able accident, his game was loſt, and none of the articles were procured. Poor Charles could no longer contain himſelf, but burſt into a flood of tears, and lamented his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy fate in ſuch melting ſtrains, that Mr. Heathorn was much affected on the occaſion; and encouraged him to make another trial, aſſuring him that, at all events, the articles ſhould be procured for him the next time he ſent to market. He alſo told Charles that "his ſon Edward, who underſtood writing and cyphering very well, would be at home in a few days, and would afford him aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in learning him."</p>
               <p>In the mean time Mr. Heathorn gave Charles a little paper, and lent him a ſmall inkſtand till he could make one for himſelf, for his ingenuity was ſuch, that he would ſoon make almoſt any thing of which he had a model. Thus equipt and encouraged, Charles returned home in high ſpirits, to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025609_0029_0FCE101B1E6A4528"/>
make his firſt attempt at writing. No ſooner had he reached home, than, regardleſs of his ſupper of ſky blue milk, he ſat down by a dim candle to make his marks, which he did without interruption this evening, as Mr. Gruff was abroad. In the morning Charles roſe earlier than uſual, and was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his deſign with great attention. But the mortifications of this ill fated boy are not yet at an end; when Mr. Gruff got up, and found him at this buſineſs, he began a moſt violent ſtorm, and in order to vent his ſpleen at Charles for waſting his time, as he called it, he threw the inkſtand againſt the chimney back, and the paper into the fire, and ordered him immediately to the barn to take care of the cattle.</p>
               <p>Thus deprived in an inſtant of what he held moſt dear and valuable, he went out to execute the orders he had received. His heart was ready to burſt on the occaſion. Such barbarous treatment almoſt killed him. But his habits of obedience had been ſuch from infancy, that he went without grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſubmitted to this ſeverity with ſome degree of fortitude. An incident took place on this occaſion which ſhows the folly and danger of indulging violent paſſions, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on trivial occaſions. Mr. Gruff
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025609_0030_0FCE101DEA461138"/>
paid dear for the indulgence of his paſſion at this time. Not ſatisfied with deſtroying Charles' paper and ink, beſides uſing very abuſive language to him, he attempted to give him a blow, as he was going out at the door, but Charles being too ſpry for him, jumped down the ſteps out of his reach. The old churl loſt the balance of himſelf in making this effort, and came tumbling after him to the bottom of the ſteps, much to the injury of his head and ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>As Charles was doing his morning's work, he reflected on his ſituation as almoſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. His mind ſeemed half diſtracted. He ſometimes thought of leaving Mr. Gruff pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and ſeeking his fortune in the wide world—Here again a thouſand evils met him—No friends to throw himſelf upon—The ſhame of running away—The difficulty of procuring ſubſiſtence, and many other things crowded in upon the mind. He recollected alſo the fate of John Shields, a lad who had not long before left his place with Mr. James Furniel. This lad, finding himſelf beyond the reſtraints of a maſter or guardian, fell into many evil practices, and at laſt was brought into a very diſgraceful condition, by means of connecting himſelf with ſome bad companions. Charles, tho young, had
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025609_0031_0FCE10204BDA06F0"/>
conſideration enough to think of theſe things, and to apprehend the danger he might be in from ſuch a meaſure; and therefore determined to put on reſolution to bear whatever ſhould be laid upon him, and to do his duty whether others did theirs or not.</p>
               <p>In this conduct of Charles we have a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidence of the uſefulneſs of early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. Had the powers of nature been left like the wild foreſt without cultivation he would not have reaſoned thus. His mother had early impreſt his mind both with the duty and the ſafety of being faithful. She aſſured him that God would not leave nor forſake thoſe who were true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their truſt—that altho they might be brought to many ſtraits and difficulties, yet if they continued ſteady in doing what they were ſet about, and faithful to their truſt, they might leave the event. Theſe pious leſſons had made a deep impreſſion on Charles' mind, eſpecially as he ſaw an example of it in her, and being a lad of an enterprizing ſpirit, he reſolved to continue faithful to Mr. Gruff, till he could get out of his hands in a proper way.</p>
               <p>Nothing could divert him from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the neceſſary materials for writing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025609_0032_0FCE1023E9148E48"/>
and cyphering. Nor was it long before he obtained them by the aſſiſtance of Mr. Heathorn, whoſe ſon was now ready to aid his deſigns by any inſtruction in his power. But ſuch was Mr. Gruff's watchfulneſs leſt Charles ſhould <hi>waſte</hi> ſome of his time at this employment, that he was obliged to hide his paper. In order that he might ſecure it from Mr. Gruff's reach, he hid it in the garret, under the roof of the houſe, where the ſtiffened knee of his cruel perſecutor could not bend in ſearch for it. Hence this poor lad drew forth his apparatus as it were by ſtealth, and watching his opportunities, made conſiderable advances, both in writing and arithmetic. All the money he could get, he laid out for books, paper, &amp;c.—and by his great application and perſeverance he acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable ſhare of knowledge. His thirſt for knowledge was not abated by the difficulties he had to encounter; nor could any thing divert him from his purſuit after it. A ſpirit ſo enterprizing could not fail of making progreſs without uſual means.</p>
               <p>Charles did not forget the good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his mother had given him, tho amidſt the hurry and confuſion of worldly affairs at Mr. Gruff's there was no appearance of religion. He continued to repeat the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025609_0033_0FCE1026767F2048"/>
his mother had taught, every night and morning; and it was a comfort to him in this unfriended ſituation, to recollect any thing his mother had taught him. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways went to public worſhip, and was very attentive while there. Indeed Mr. Gruff was exemplary in this reſpect. He was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom abſent from public worſhip, but his converſation, like that of Agricola, was wholly "about the oxen of the field." Charles would often mention, to thoſe to whom he could ſpeak freely, ſomething the miniſter ſaid, which ſhowed he did not go there to laugh and play, as many boys do; but to hear and regard what was ſaid. The clergyman, who was a kind benevolent man, obſerved his attentiveneſs, and took occaſion to notice him ſometimes. As he knew the character of Mr. Gruff, he endeavoured to alleviate Charles' condition by ſpeaking kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him. He encouraged Charles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to behave well, with an aſſurance that ſuch never failed of doing well in the end. This was comfortable language to Charles. When he was relating this part of his hiſtory, which he often did in a circle of friends, he could ſcarcely ſuppreſs the tears of gratitude for "the goodneſs of that excellent clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man," as he would expreſs it, and for that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025609_0034_0FCE1027CDF63418"/>
of Mr. Heathorn. Their benevolence ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo diſintereſted, and ſo well applied, that it made an impreſſion on Charles' heart that time itſelf could not efface.</p>
               <p>Happy would it have been for Jeremy Demmond, and Mary Jennings, of <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>, if ſome good people had taken compaſſion on them, before the cruelties they experience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the hard blows they received on their heads, from thoſe paſſionate people to whoſe care they were committed, had turned their brains, and made them diſtracted. They continued a long time, living monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to all that part of the country, of the dreadful effects of ſuch abuſes. It is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon human nature, that in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it ſhould be ſo loſt to feeling as to practice ſuch cruelties upon thoſe helpleſs orphans, whoſe miſfortunes put them into the power of others. It is a reproach upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that ſuch cruelties ſhould be ſuffered in it. How many poor orphan children are daily ſuffering unmerited abuſe from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting hands they fall into; without a friend in the world to ſpeak for them, or even to look compaſſionately upon them! Some, no doubt, ſink under the weight of theſe abuſes, and find relief only in death. Others have their ſpirits broken ſo, that they
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025609_0035_0FCE10298536D2D8"/>
become lifeleſs and incapable of holding up their heads in ſociety; and being diſpirited, they have no power to make thoſe exertions which they might otherwiſe have done. This was not the caſe indeed with Charles, for there were many who ſeemed to pity him, and his ſpirits were proof againſt all his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>About this time an event took place that ſuſpended his ſufferings for a while; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him an opportunity to give full proof of the goodneſs of his heart. It muſt here be obſerved, that among Mr. Gruff's many faults, covetouſneſs, that deteſtable vice which degrades men below the animals, was not the leaſt. So extremely did this mean ſpirit prevail, that he would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times endanger his life rather than not have it gratified. It well nigh coſt him his life, when on a cold evening he mounted his barefoot horſe, for he was too covetous to be at the expenſe of having him ſhod, to ride ſome diſtance on ſome buſineſs. On his return home, his horſe fell on an icy place which a light ſnow had covered, and ran homeward with all ſpeed, leaving his rider ſprawling on the ground. As Charles was returning from Mr. Heathorn's, whether he had taken this opportunity to go for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025609_0036_0FCE102E50321288"/>
in writing, &amp;c. the horſe came on a full gallop; and Charles perceiving it to be Mr. Gruff's horſe without the rider, ſtopt him, and apprehending that ſome diſaſter had happened, led him back by the road he came. Having paſſed ſome diſtance, he thought he heard the groaning of a perſon in diſtreſs, and, following the ſound, he arrived at the ſpot where Mr. Gruff had fallen, and lay in a moſt deplorable condition. He was ſo diſabled by the fall, that he muſt have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſpot, for it was extreme cold, had it not been for the good offices of Charles, who with great difficulty helped him home.</p>
               <p>It was on this occaſion, and during his confinement for the greater part of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that Charles diſcovered the goodneſs of his own heart. He expreſſed great concern at the time, for what had happened, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the moſt faithful and careful attention to him, and to all his directions during his whole confinement. This was almoſt too much for Mr. Gruff to bear. It ſoftened his heart, and made him repent of ſome of his ill natured treatment of Charles. The death of Mr. Gruff, not a great while after this, put a period to the ſufferings of Poor Charles at this place. As he had never been bound to Mr. Gruff, ſo he conſidered himſelf at
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025609_0037_0FCE102FC6764C00"/>
liberty to quit a place that was ſo diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, which he did ſoon after his death. As new proſpects now open before him, and the ſcene begins to brighten, we refer the reader to the next chapter for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account of him.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Charles' good conduct—his bravery and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in ſaving a young officer—Lieutenant Smith's letter to his father concerning Charles—is invited to his father's houſe.</head>
               <p>THIS was a moſt fortunate eſcape for Charles Worthy. It opened the way for him to exert his native powers, and in ſome meaſure to gratify his prevailing inclination, to improve his mind. Tho' he diſcovered ſuch a thirſt for knowledge, yet he never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the leaſt diſpoſition to quit the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had been ſo far brought up in, that of farming. Indeed, he ſeemed as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to excel in the art of farming as in the knowledge of letters. His views were not elevated above his employment, which proved a great advantage to him afterwards. He never felt ſo happy as when conſcious of induſtriouſly following his occupation, and faithfully diſcharging the truſt committed to him.</p>
               <p>Charles was about ſixteen years old, when Mr. Gruff died, and of a healthy robuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. He had ſerved there ſeveral years,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:025609_0039_0FCE1033CF71B470"/>
but had very little more than the clothes on his back when he left that place. He was now to caſt himſelf on the wide world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a friend to aſſiſt, or even to adviſe him. His firſt object was to go and viſit his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſiſters, who were ſcattered about in different places. The older ones had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgotten him, for he had never been allowed time to go and ſee them, and the younger ones ſcarce ever knew him. They were alſo almoſt grown out of his knowledge. But they were no ſooner made known to him, than he diſcovered great brotherly affection for them, and ſhowed them every mark of affection in his power. He was much afflicted to find one of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle brothers in a very low ſtate of health; and was induced to tarry and labor for Mr. Harding, with whom he lived, that he might have an opportunity of affording his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er every aſſiſtance in his power, until he died, which was not long after. Charles was very much grieved at the death of his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Mr. Harding was deſirous of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Charles continue with him, but he choſe to viſit his little ſiſter, who was an infant when his father died, and was placed in the hands of a diſtant relation of his mother, in the town where ſhe lived and died. He
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025609_0040_0FCE10362B1724A8"/>
the rather declined Mr. Harding's offer of ſmall wages, as he hoped to find better buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at this place. But being diſappointed in this reſpect, and finding his little ſiſter well provided for, he returned to Mr. Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the terms he had propoſed, which were but ſmall, indeed, but were the beſt he could then obtain.</p>
               <p>Charles had nothing in the world to rely upon but his own character. He ſeemed ſenſible of this, and endeavoured to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf by his good conduct. He was not wholly free from the ſallies of youth, but he carefully avoided the follies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes too common among young men. He was generally ſober and grave, and always temperate. By preſerving himſelf in this ſtate, he was always fit for duty and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He abhorred falſehood; and never uſed any bad language, either obſcene or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane. His tongue was never polluted with the foul language of profane ſwearing, and he would often check his companions whom he heard uſe it. How much more honorable would it be in young men to uſe the ſame caution, than to give a looſe to their tongues in the manner they often do! What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement can they have to it? Beſides the impiety of this language, it is an unmanly
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025609_0041_0FCE10389EC12370"/>
and uſeleſs practice. It alſo has a moſt baneful influence on civil ſociety. It affords no evidence of wit or ſenſe, of courage or good breeding. The loweſt and moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned among men are great adepts in it, and in them it is conſidered as a mark of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity. Will decent people practice the ſame as an evidence of their good breeding? The cuſtom of profane ſwearing has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to introduce perjury, and otherwiſe to injure the intereſts of ſociety. By making oaths familiar on all occaſions, it leſſens that veneration for the Deity, and that reverence for an oath which makes it uſeful on proper occaſions.</p>
               <p>I ſhall paſs over ſeveral years of Charles' life, after the death of Mr. Gruff, in which there were no incidents worthy of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice. During this period he laid up a ſmall ſum of money, which his induſtry had acquired, and his prudence preſerved. He had the good fortune to recommend himſelf to the eſteem of thoſe with whom he lived, and never wanted for employ. At length he was tempted by a conſiderable bounty to enliſt among the troops who were going to the frontiers againſt the ſavages. It was dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this campaign that Charles had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhowing himſelf to be both
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025609_0042_0FCE1039CC1552A0"/>
brave and generous. His courage had been tried by ſeveral ſkirmiſhes with the enemy. But about the beginning of October he was in a pretty ſevere engagement, in which the enemy got the advantage. During this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, a young officer by the name of Smith was badly wounded, and left on the ground. Charles perceiving this, flew to his relief, and at the hazard of his own life, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued him from the hands of the purſuing enemy. In doing this, Charles was ſlightly wounded in two places, which, tho not deep, bled profuſely. But this generous young ſoldier ſeemed regardleſs of himſelf in his exertions to ſave this brave young officer, whoſe wounds were ſo much worſe than his own.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Smith was carried to the fort, where the firſt dreſſings were performed, and in a ſhort time was in a condition to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the hoſpital at <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. Charles ſoon recovered of his wounds, ſo far as to be able to attend Lieutenant Smith, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted of the commanding officer permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to keep him as a nurſe, until he ſhould be recovered. This removal through rough roads did him a great injury, and threw him into a violent fever, which endangered his life. His wounds were painful, and his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025609_0043_0FCE103C90695EC8"/>
truly deplorable; but the conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and great tenderneſs of Charles, was a great alleviation of his condition, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared Charles very much to him. It was a conſiderable time before he recovered ſo far as to write to his friends. During this interval, which ſeemed very long to them, they could hear nothing of him. Various reports were circulated about him; but none that could be relied on. His parents who lived in the county of <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               <p>The receipt this letter diſpelled a thick cloud that had for ſome time hung over the family, and ſpread joy through the houſe. Mr. Smith prepared to go on immediately to the aſſiſtance of his ſon, and on his arrival found him in a fine way. The arrival of his father afforded one of thoſe affecting ſcenes which intereſt the feelings of the heart. It was ſuch as might naturally be expected at the firſt meeting between an affectionate parent and a long loſt ſon. Nor was the ſcene much leſs ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when Lieut. Smith pointed out Charles to his father, as the perſon of whom he had
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025609_0045_0FCE1043AA6EE658"/>
written. Mr. Smith caught Charles by the hand, but had no power of utterance.—As ſoon as he had a little recovered from the firſt flow of his paſſions, occaſioned by the firſt ſight of his ſon's deliverer, he thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him—"To you"—the tear ſtarting in his eye—"to you I owe the liberty, the life of my ſon—to you we owe the future peace and tranquillity of a much diſtreſſed family. If aught in my power can contrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute to your happineſs, name it, and it ſhall be done." It was on this occaſion that Charles conducted with a magnanimity pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to himſelf. He very modeſtly replied, with a low bow, "If he had been the means of adding to any body's happineſs, he was very glad; but what he had done for Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Smith, was no more than his duty, and nothing could be ſo great a reward as the conſciouſneſs of doing that." During Mr. Smith's tarry at the hoſpital with his ſon, he had opportunity of ſeeing the kind and benevolent diſpoſition of Charles. He was much pleaſed with him, and inquired of him where he had lived, and what had been his manner of life. Charles inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Smith that "he had been bred a farmer, and not a ſoldier;" and modeſtly related to him ſome of the hardſhips and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025609_0046_0FCE10464396FDB8"/>
ſufferings he had experienced at Mr. Gruff's, and "the diſadvantages he laboured under on account of not being able to get learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." Mr. Smith invited Charles to go to his houſe, when his ſon was able to return home, aſſuring him his aſſiſtance in improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mind, and offering him ſmall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for the winter. This was very grateful to Charles, whoſe term of enliſtment was now expired, and he knew not which way to turn himſelf. He therefore accepted Mr. Smith's offer with cheerfulneſs, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him and his ſon to his houſe. It would be in vain to attempt a deſcription of the joy which their arrival occaſioned. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination muſt ſupply the deficiency of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>

His houſe was a neat and convenient edifice, pleaſantly ſituated on the ſouthern declivity of a hill, and commanded an extenſive proſpect of well cultivated fields and meadows. His barn and granary were large and capacious; and were generally filled with the produce of his farm. His family and domeſtics were well fed, and kindly treated.

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025609_0048_0FCE104C264A5A58"/>
and harmony. To the poor he was a daily benefactor. In every project for public good he took the lead; and was an example to all his neighbors, of regular and conſtant attendance on public worſhip, with all his numerous family and domeſtics.</p>
               <p>This was a paradiſe to Charles. He had never before been in ſo well regulated a fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily. He ſo ingratiated himſelf with Mr. and Mrs. Smith, that he continued with them a conſiderable time, and daily grew in their eſteem, as well on account of his amiable temper, as his faithfulneſs in their ſervice. It was during his reſidence here, that he made great proficiency in uſeful knowledge. The winter evenings, which moſt other young people paſſed in a uſeleſs manner, if no worſe, he ſpent in reading, writing, arithmetic, &amp;c. This gave him a ſuperiority to moſt of the young people, both in knowledge and in writing well, and in readineſs at figures; and his ready wit, of which he had a good ſhare, made him appear brilliant when he mixed with them. Charles derived many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from living in ſo reputable a farmer's houſe. Beſides the many maxims of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic economy he learned from Mrs. Smith, with whom he was a favorite, he gathered many maxims from the experience of Mr. Smith, in the huſbandry art.</p>

                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:025609_0049_0FCE104D4F910FC8"/>
Having paſſed ſeveral years in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and laid up money enough to purchaſe a ſmall tract of wild land, Charles began to think of looking for a ſettlement in life; but he did not think it prudent to take any ſtep, eſpecially ſo important an one as this, without adviſing with Mr. Smith about it. This worthy patron approved his deſign, and offered to lend him money, if he ſhould ſtand in need of more than he had. In this inſtance, Charles felt the benefit of a good character, he found the loan of a ſmall ſum neceſſary to purchaſe a tract of land which was far preferable to that he had before in view. This was a tract in the frontier ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, which was to be ſold on terms very advantageous to the purchaſer. By Mr. Smith's advice, Charles went on to view it, in company with a young man who was going on the ſame deſign.</p>
               <p>It was in this tour that Charles met with the following humorous affair, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a place in the hiſtory of his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The affair happened at a Mr. Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's, a man of ſome note in the back ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, to whom Mr. Smith had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Charles for advice. Mr. Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's hoſpitality was well known to many, and Charles reached his houſe on Saturday
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025609_0050_0FCE1051BA2A9060"/>
night, and was received with much courteſy on account of Mr. Smith's recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The next day they all went to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip at ſome diſtance, leaving only a Scotch lad to take care of the houſe. This lad was rather a ſtranger in that part of the country, and knew but little of the world he lived in. He had been taught, however, to read his bible. When the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were all gone, Jonny, for ſo he was called, ſat down very compoſedly to reading his bible. He had not been long at this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before he was ſurprized by the arrival of ſeveral men who made a ſtrange appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but with great familiarity were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the houſe. This greatly alarmed the honeſt Highlander. But being educated in the habits of fidelity, he determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the houſe that had been left in his care. He therefore faſtened the door, and, ſeizing his broad ſword, the only patrimony he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, put himſelf into a poſture of defence. The Indians, however, regardleſs of the fright that Poor Jonny appeared to be in on this occaſion, burſt open the door, and without any ceremony, helped themſelves to ſuch things as the houſe afforded. This ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the honeſt lad, that he ruſhed into the midſt of them, and in the language of his
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025609_0051_0FCE10532A4A1C60"/>
own country, demanded who they were, and what they wanted. They underſtood about as much of his queſtion as he did of their anſwer, which was made in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. His paſſions were now wrought up to ſuch a pitch, that his prudence entirely forſook him. In the violence of his anger, he made a paſs at one of them with his ruſty ſword, but fortunately miſſed his aim. This produced ſo terrible a yell among them, that his fortitude inſtantly deſerted him, but his prudence ſoon returned, and he took to his heels, leaving this horrible crew of infernals, as he ſuppoſed them to be, in quiet poſſeſſion of the field. They were highly diverted at the conſternation which their innocent free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had put this new comer to the country into. He made his way with all poſſible ſpeed to the meeting houſe, and running, with his hair all an end, to Mr. Scammons, informed him what was going on at home, and begged him to haſten with him to prevent further deſtruction. Mr. Scammons inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that they were his friends, although they uſed great freedom, yet it was common with that people, and aſſured him he had nothing to fear from them.</p>
               <p>This adventure Charles related to Mr. Smith on his return, and diverted the whole
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025609_0052_0FCE1054D43F9418"/>
family greatly with ſeveral other anecdotes of Jonny's honeſty and ſimplicity. But what was of much more conſequence to Charles Worthy, than the adventures of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land lad, was, he had made a purchaſe of the land he went after. Mr. Smith heartily congratulated him on his becoming a land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, and told him he did not doubt but that he would one day be a wealthy farmer; that his induſtry would conquer the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the foreſt; and his prudence would preſerve the property he ſhould acquire. He alſo informed Charles that he might make his houſe his home in winter, till he could find one at his own place. This was a kind offer, and was moſt thankfully accepted by him. At the proper ſeaſon he went on to fell the trees, and prepare for a future har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and to erect the neceſſary buildings for his accommodation. Here he found many difficulties to grapple with; but his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and perſeverance carried him through them all, until he had ſubdued the wildneſs of the foreſt, and converted a ſufficient part of it into a fruitful field, to make it a deſirable place of ſteady reſidence. Thus encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the effects of his induſtry, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for domeſtic life, by a dwelling ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to begin life with in the country, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

now to think of a true ſaying that "it is not fit for man to be alone." Tho Charles had acted with great diſcretion with regard to the ſex, by avoiding any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of attaching himſelf to one and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, yet they were not all alike indifferent to him. He was not at a loſs where to offer himſelf. All his difficulty was about the manner of doing it with a probability of ſucceſs. On this occaſion he had a moſt critical, <hi>delicate</hi> part to act, as will appear by the following circumſtances.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of Timothy Puffum—young Mr. Worthy's marriage, ſettlement, and pleaſing proſpects.</head>
               <p>YOUNG Mr. Worthy, for ſo I ſhall now call him, was a very modeſt youth, and had a heart of great ſenſibility and grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude. Theſe were qualities that would recommend him to the parents of the young woman on whom he had placed his affection. But when he compared his circumſtances with their's, he ſtarted at the idea of aſking their conſent to his marrying one of their daughters. He alſo feared the imputation of ingratitude, and of violating the rights of hoſpitality, in forming an attachment with a female to whoſe parents he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted by many acts of kindneſs. Indeed, every thing ſeemed to be againſt him, except the countenance which Margrett, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt daughter of Mr. Smith, gave to his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. This mutual and growing attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a ſecret to the family, and was ſcarce known unto themſelves until young Mr. Worthy's circumſtances enabled him to place this object of his affections in a toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025609_0055_0FCE105C69CB0150"/>
ſituation. As ſhe had been well edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in a farmer's houſe, ſhe was the better qualified for a farmer's wife. Young Mr. Worthy was not inſenſible of her worth; but he had difficulties to encounter that have not yet been named. The perſonal figure of ſo blooming a girl had attracted the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſeveral young men, and ſhe actually had an offer of marriage with a young man the only ſon of Mr. Timothy Puffum, a man of large property, but very ignorant of the world, and had trained up his ſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. He had ſeveral daughters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but as it was not cuſtomary for daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to receive any great ſhare of the eſtate, Timothy the ſon was conſidered as the heir of a large eſtate.—Happy for daughters, that in modern times fathers are willing to own them as children in the diſtribution of their eſtates! However, as things then went, it was thought quite needleſs to bring up Timothy to any buſineſs; for why need one, who was heir to ſo good a farm, learn to work upon it.—"I obſerve, ſaid old Mr. Puffum, that your moſt richeſt merchants don't bring up their ſuns to buſineſs; and I don't ſee for my part why our Tim needs be fetcht up as tho'f he was one of the moſt vulgareſt ſort of fokes."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:025609_0056_0FCE106062D63E50"/>
Timothy was trained up agreeably to theſe ſentiments; and as his father had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced very little advantage from ſchools when young, he was prevailed upon to keep him from ſchool whenever his wife ſaid "it is too cold or too wet for Timmy to go out; or, the poor boy is not well enough to go to ſchool." Nothing can be more ruinous to children than ſuch indulgence. It makes them peeviſh, fretful and unhappy. It learns them to be deceitful, and to pretend ill health, till they begin to imagine it real. It inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts their learning, and diſcourages them when they ſee their mates go before them. The conſequence of this mode of education was that Timothy Puffum, jun. proves a great blockhead. He could ride a horſe well, and perform his part at a race or a ſhooting match, and the like; but he had very little pretenſions to any improvements of mind, nor had he very great pretenſions to virtue.</p>
               <p>He had but juſt arrived at the age of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood when his father died, and left him in poſſeſſion of the eſtate, after paying a few legacies. Being now the proprietor of a large well cultivated farm, and conſiderable money at intereſt, he thought himſelf a good match for any lady in the country. What
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025609_0057_0FCE1061A0A88CC8"/>
then muſt have been his mortification when he found that Margrett Smith preferred a poor laboring young man to one of his fortune? It was this apparent preference that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened young Mr. Worthy to broach the affair to her parents. Mr. and Mrs. Smith, both expreſſed great ſurprize at the propoſal. They raiſed many objections, and declined for ſome time giving their conſent. But upon finding that the attachment was too ſtrong to be broken, they yielded to the wiſhes of the young couple; and by conſent of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, young Mr. Worthy called the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſprightly Margrett Smith his wife, the next chriſtmas eve. An event ſo much wiſhed for on his part, and not objected to on her's, gave a new ſpring to his ſpirits, and he reſolved that nothing ſhould be wanting on his part to deſerve the favor he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. His firſt object was to conciliate the minds of the parents to an event, to which they had conſented with ſome reluctance; and as they were rational, good kind of people, he happily effected it. Probably they were actuated by the ſame maxim that Themiſtocles was, who married a daughter to a poor but deſerving man, ſaying—"I love merit without wealth, better than wealth without merit."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:025609_0058_0FCE1066570F07C8"/>
The ſpring following their marriage, they bid adieu to their friends, and went to enter upon their new plantation, accompanied by her brother, whom Mr. Worthy had reſcued from the Indians, and who had been his friend in the affair or Margrett, and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal inſtrument in obtaining the conſent of her parents. The ſcene at parting was moſt tender and affecting. The mother hung on the neck of the daughter, and with all the fondneſs of maternal affection, held her to her boſom. While the father beſtowed on them a thouſand bleſſings, the children told the greatneſs of their pain by the profuſion of their tears. But they were much relieved by the favorable accounts which young Mr. Smith brought back of their ſituation and proſpects. This account he gave with all that ardor which we feel when we take a decided part in the affairs of another, and are deeply affected by their concerns. Young Mr. Smith had never forgotten his obligation to Mr. Worthy, and felt gratified at having an opportunity to repay ſome of the debt of grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude he owed him. Several circumſtances occurred in this tour which brought to his mind afreſh the whole of that ſcene, which now led him to view Mr. Worthy as his deliverer and his brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:025609_0059_0FCE1068337566A0"/>
He repreſented the ſpot he had choſen as a fertile ſoil on the banks of a beautiful ſtream that ſoon empties itſelf into a large river, leaving a fine interval, and opening a moſt enchanting proſpect. This ſituation invited many ſettlers, both on account of the goodneſs of the ſoil, and the convenience of water carriage to market. It was on this choſen ſpot that Mr. Worthy firſt felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a freeholder, and independent of the caprice of others both for his exertions and his enjoyments. His farm, his houſe, his barn, were objects which preſented new ideas to his imagination. The ſame objects never before made the ſame impreſſions on his mind. Whatever he poſſeſſed was his own. The knowledge he had acquired was the effect of his own exertions and perſevering application. The property he enjoyed was the fruit of his own labor; and his improvements were the effects of his own experience and obſervation.</p>
               <p>His rural ſituation was no longer a gloomy ſolitary retreat. The cheerfulneſs and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his wife gave a new face to every thing; and he taſted new pleaſure in every enjoyment, and in every purſuit. He went forth to his daily buſineſs with more alacrity and pleaſure than before, becauſe he now ſaw that he did not labor for himſelf alone. His
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025609_0060_0FCE1069155A1850"/>
joys were increaſed by the ſhare that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret took in them, and his ſorrows were leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by being divided. Often would ſhe go into the field where he was at work, and, as ſhe ſat knitting under the ſhady oak, ſhe would applaud his dexterity, and lighten his labor by ſeeming to ſhare in it. What ſubſtantial felicity muſt this happy man now enjoy? He had encountered difficulties of various kinds, and been inured to many hardſhip but now feels himſelf delivered from them, and enjoying an entire new current of felicity. He owed nothing for his poſſeſſions. "He therefore knew no other landlord than the Lord of all land," to whom he profeſſed the ſincereſt gratitude.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Mr. Worthy's reflections on his own ſituation—birth of a ſon—his humanity—tenderneſs to animals.</head>
               <p>THE birth of his firſt ſon was an event that almoſt overwhelmed Mr. Worthy with joy. Various motions of pleaſure thrilled through his heart on this occaſion. He now felt himſelf acting in a new ſphere, and moved by new obligations to fill up the duties of the relations of huſband and father. As the number of their children afterwards increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a ſenſe of the obligations increaſed, and with their growth the pleaſures of life grew alſo. What heart felt delight muſt he have experienced when his little ſon was able to go with him into the fields, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him with his prattle, in the opening fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? By this practice, the child drew in health with every breath, while he inſpired the parent's heart with joy through every vein. The Emperor of China, when plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as an example to his kingdom,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Emperor of China is obliged to appear in the field at the head of his laborers in the ſeaſon of plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and with his own hand hold the plough as an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of induſtry to the people of his kingdom. The Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe are ſaid to be an induſtrious people, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the vegetable ſyſtem of nature better than any others. Their veneration for agriculture certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this annual cuſtom of their Emperor's becoming a huſbandman every ſpring, in the encouragement given to it by their laws, and in the honors conferred on thoſe who excel in cultivating the ground.</note> could not know the pleaſure he experienced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:025609_0062_0FCE106F73E8D568"/>
Mr. Worthy was not inattentive to the moral uſes to which many appearances in the natural world might be applied. The trees which drop their leaves and fruit in autumn, and bud again in the ſpring, he conſidered as a lively emblem of the death and reviviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or riſing again of the human race. The difficulty that attended this doctrine he thought he ſaw unfolded in the grain ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up after the apparent death of the ſeed. The myriads of inſects that ariſe from the earth, and play in the milder beams of the ſetting ſun, he thought afforded leſſons of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to ſhort lived man, and of the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a diligent improvement of the ſhort ſpace allotted him on earth. The aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtinct of animals, which in many of them bears a ſtrong affinity to the boaſted reaſon of man, gave him a high idea of their rights, and a thorough conviction of the moral obligation man is under to treat all animals with tenderneſs. His humanity was
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025609_0063_0FCE10708DF950F8"/>
therefore tranſferred to them on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The ſervices of the laboring cattle he would reward by ample refreſhments and gentle uſage. The ſtrong and greedy he would reſtrain from oppreſſing and injuring the weak and timid. Such was his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to animals that he would not ſuffer the little birds that reſorted to his yard through diſtreſs of weather, to be moleſted or injured. He eſteemed it a groſs violation of the laws of hoſpitality to take advantage of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they placed in him by taking ſhelter under his wing.</p>
               <p>It is a ſingular mark of barbarity in man that he ſhould perfidiouſly take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the great and affecting diſtreſs which has induced theſe poor innocent birds to come and aſk of him that ſcanty pittance of grain and ſeeds, which but for them would be loſt; and murder them for preſuming ſo far on his clemency. The following affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anecdote ſhows both the cruelty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>policy of it:—"Mr.<gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>, one of the moſt famous and extraordinary farmers that has ever done honor to the ſtate of Connecticut, by his timely and humane aſſiſtance in a hard winter, ſaved the quails from being entirely deſtroyed. They periſhed all over the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, none of their delightful whiſtlings were

heard the next ſpring, but upon this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's farm; and to his humanity we owe the continuation of their muſic." Every farmer who will uſe the ſame humanity, and be at a little pains to cheriſh the little birds that hover around him in winter, will find himſelf rewarded for his trouble by their various notes in ſpring.</p>
               <p>The various warblings of the birds which have ſurvived the ſeverities of our climate, or returned from milder regions to ſerenade us with the return of ſpring, ſurpaſſes deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription. The pleaſure which their tuneful notes afford an attentive ear, is thus beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſcribed by an enlightened American farmer:—"I generally riſe from my bed about that indiſtinct interval, which, properly ſpeaking, is neither night nor day; for this is the moment of the moſt univerſal vocal choir. Who can liſten unmoved to the ſweet love tales of our little robins, told from tree to tree? or to the ſhrill cat birds?

in the conſtruction of their neſts, ill provided as we may ſuppoſe them to be with proper tools, their neatneſs, their convenience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make me aſhamed of the ſlovenlineſs of our houſes. Their love to their dame, their inceſſant careful attention, and the peculiar ſongs they addreſs to her while ſhe tediouſly incubates, or ſits upon their eggs, reminds me of my duty, could I ever forget it. Their affection to their helpleſs little ones, is a lively precept; and, in ſhort, the whole economy of what we proudly call the brute creation, is admirable in every circumſtance; and vain man, though adorned with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional gift of reaſon, might learn from the perfection of inſtinct, how to regulate the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and how to temper the errors which this ſecond gift often makes them commit. This is a ſubject on which I have often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the moſt ſerious thoughts. I have often bluſhed within myſelf, and been greatly aſtoniſhed, when I have compared the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring path they all follow, all juſt, all proper, all wiſe, up to the neceſſary degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, with the coarſe, the imperfect ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of men, not merely as governors and kings, but as maſters, as huſbands, as fathers, as citizens. If ever man was permitted to receive and enjoy ſome bleſſings that might

alleviate the many ſorrows to which he is expoſed, it is certainly in the country, when he attentively conſiders theſe raviſhing ſcenes with which he is every where ſurrounded."</p>
               <p>Few men who have devoted their time to labor, have diſcovered a more contemplative turn of mind than Mr. Worthy. Indeed, it is too much the caſe that men who labor on the earth, do not endeavor to ſoar ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently above it in their minds, though the wonders they every day behold might excite uſeful thoughts and reflections, did they prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly attend to them: To theſe Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy was particularly attentive; and the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure he derived from the many wonderful things which his occupation led him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the natural world, was very great. Beſides the moral uſes and advantages he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from his obſervations on the operations of nature, they aſſiſted him in making prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs in his buſineſs as a farmer. But his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention began now to be called to the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his children. He conſidered them, as committed to his care for inſtruction as well as proviſion for their ſupport; and that he was anſwerable before him who gave them, for the diſcharge of his duty, and in ſome meaſure anſwerable for their future char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025609_0067_0FCE10798F5E6AF0"/>
Being deeply impreſſed with theſe ſentiments, he watched with all parental attention the gradual unfolding of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſtudied their different tempers with great care. For their little faults he would contrive little puniſhments, and ſmall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements for their good actions, with a variety of expedients dictated by the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The country being thinly ſettled, it was ſome years before they could enjoy the benefit of a ſchool. Mr. Worthy was under the neceſſity therefore of aſſiſting his wife in teaching them to read, which he faithfully attended to, though the improvement of his farm and the variety of his buſineſs called him conſtantly to attend to other things. But he was at length relieved from this by the eſtabliſhment of a ſchool in the town, for which he had been long ſtriving.</p>
               <p>It is a melancholy reflection that ſo little care is taken of the riſing generation in many of our new ſettlements. Many, it is to be feared, grow up literally "like the wild aſſes colt." This is laying a wretched foundation for the ſettlement of a new country.

Ignorance and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive attendants follow in gloomy train, and render a ſettlement wretched, which with due cultivation might have been flouriſhing and happy. Where the means of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge are neglected, and the riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grow up in ignorance, the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are uſually neglected alſo. Where this is the caſe, men preſently become rude in their manners, as well as vicious in their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.

This was effected after ſome time; and Mr. Worthy found himſelf very happy in being able to accompany his wife and little family ſteadily to the duties of public devotion. How did his heart ſwell with joy to ſee the

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Timothy Puffum turns trader—his ruin.—Story of the Sloth and the Beaver of North and South America.</head>
               <p>WHILE things were going on thus proſperouſly with Worthy, and he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying with his wife the peaceful fruits of virtuous and induſtrious lives, the caſe was very different with Timothy Puffum. The way in which this young man had been ſuffered to grow up has already been related, and the eſtate which fell into his hands at the death of his father. The farm which came to him in good order, ſoon began to go out of repair, and as he had not been brought up to labor, nor even to the knowledge of any buſineſs, he knew not by what means to put it into order. Thoſe who underſtand the leaſt of buſineſs themſelves are the moſt troubleſome to do buſineſs for; and are moſt apt to be peeviſh and fretful at thoſe whom they employ. This was the caſe with young Mr. Puffum. Having the common diſeaſe of thoſe who have very little acquaintance with the affairs of huſbandry, he conceited
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025609_0071_0FCE10810FABBFD0"/>
he was maſter of the buſineſs; and being humored in every thing when he was a boy, he was ſo peeviſh and ill humored that there was no pleaſing of him. He carried this to ſo great a length, finding fault and quarreling with his workmen, that it became difficult for him to hire laborers. It was on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that Hodge, a faithful man who had the care of his farm, left him; and he was obliged to ſell ſome of his ſtock to pay the arrears of wages due to Hodge, and to ſettle with the dairy woman, who left him on the ſame account. So that his affairs were in a worſe train than ever.</p>
               <p>A circumſtance that haſtened his ruin very much, was his marriage with a vain young girl of no good character, and who had nothing to recommend her but a tolerable outſide figure, of which ſhe was ſufficiently vain, and cared for little elſe but dreſs and amuſement. He was obliged to make ſale frequently of ſtock and other things to gratify her gay fancy. His embarraſſments became ſo great after a while that he ſcarcely knew which way to turn himſelf. At length he thought of a plan to get rid of all his diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and to put himſelf into a fine way of living. He ſaw others flouriſh and proſper in trade, and thought it an eaſy thing to get
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025609_0072_0FCE1082AD228508"/>
a genteel living without any trouble. This was very pleaſing to his wife. She thought this was a great deal more better way than to be nothing but farmers, and to be obliged to work. Then, ſaid ſhe, we can get every thing we want without paying for it, and how much more cleaverer that will be than to have to go to the ſhops to lay out our money, and then have to ſell ſomething or other to pay for it. Oh! I wiſh we had them now. I am tired of this dull poor way of ſcrubbing along. I hope you will get a good parcel of the moſt fineſt ribbons and fathars ſo that a body can have eno of them. Theſe is the beſt things to ſell, for I want a good many now."—A fine cuſtomer indeed!</p>
               <p>But Mr. Puffum did not need much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading. He was therefore eaſily induced to go and contract with a merchant for a quantity of goods, for the payment of which he pledged his farm. But what can he do with a ſhop of goods, who could not take care of the affairs of a farm? He was unacquainted with accounts, and knew not either the qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity or value of goods, nor did he conſider the neceſſity of being punctual in his pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but grew more careleſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant than before. He and his wife were their own ſteadieſt cuſtomers, and were
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025609_0073_0FCE1086C6E0A2A8"/>
every day conſuming their farm without perceiving it; and it was not long before dreſs, company and frolics had waſted the goods he had been entruſted with, and not much payment made for them. The debt ſtill hung over him. He had no way to raiſe money to diſcharge it, but by ſelling his farm, which he was obliged to do at a great diſadvantage, ſo that it would not pay the debt. All their fine proſpects were now at an end, and they had no means of living left them, but were reduced to extreme poverty and diſtreſs. He had no reſource within himſelf, was not accuſtomed to labor, and was habituated to idleneſs and diſſipation. To their other diſtreſſes they added that of ſtrife and contention. They accuſed each other as being the cauſe of all the evils that they now labored under. But this only made a bad matter worſe. After living ſome time in this dreadful ſituation, he turned horſe-jockey. Intemperance and gaming followed. Being poor and vicious, he become friendleſs and wretched. He continued in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of many ruinous and diſgraceful vices, till at length he died miſerably in a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome jail.</p>
               <p>Theſe effects of idleneſs, extravagance and folly, may be uſefully contraſted with
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025609_0074_0FCE1087F8482C30"/>
induſtry, in the following ſtory, with which I ſhall conclude this chapter. The Sloth is an animal of South America, and is ſo ill formed for motion that a few paces are often the journey of a week, and ſo indiſpoſed to move, that he never changes his place but when impelled by the ſevereſt ſtings of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He lives upon the leaves, fruit and flowers of trees, and often on the bark itſelf, when nothing beſides is left for his ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. As a large quantity of food is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for his ſupport, he generally ſtrips a tree of all its verdure in leſs than a fortnight; and being then deſtitute of food, he drops down like a lifeleſs maſs, from the branches to the ground. After remaining torpid or ſenſeleſs, ſometime, from the ſhock received by the fall, he prepares for a journey to ſome neighboring tree, to which he crawls ſo ſlowly that his motion can hardly be perceived. When he has arrived, he aſcends the tree, and being half ſtarved, ſoon devours what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the branches afford. By conſuming the bark, he ſoon deſtroys the life of the tree; and thus the ſource from which his ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is derived, is loſt, and he has nothing leſt to ſupport him. Such is the miſerable ſtate of this ſlothful animal. How different are the comforts and enjoyments of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025609_0075_0FCE10894AE882D0"/>
Beaver. This creature is found in the northern parts of America, and is about two feet long and one foot high. The figure ſomewhat reſembles that of a rat. In the months of June and July the Beavers aſſemble and form a ſociety, which generally conſiſts of more than two hundred. They always fix their abode by the ſide of a lake or river; and in order to make a dead water, they erect, with incredible labor, a dam, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps eighty or a hundred feet long, and ten or twelve feet thick at the bottom. When this dike or dam is completed, they build their ſeveral apartments, which are divided into three ſtories. The firſt is below the level of the mole, and is for the moſt part full of water. The walls of their habitations are perpendicular, and about two feet thick. If any wood project from them, they cut it off with their teeth, which are more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than ſaws; and by the help of their tails, they plaiſter all their work with a kind of mortar, which they prepare of dry graſs and clay mixed together. In Auguſt or September, they begin to lay up their ſtores of food; which conſiſts of the wood of the birch, the plane, and of ſome other trees. Thus they paſs the gloomy winter in eaſe and plenty.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of Mrs. Worthy—Of old Mrs. Grudges, and her envious and ill natured ſpeeches.</head>
               <p>HITHERTO I have ſaid but little of Mrs. Worthy; but as ſhe is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to bear an important part in the management of his domeſtic affairs, I think a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account of her character and management, neceſſary to this hiſtory. What has already been related ſhows her wiſdom in the choice of a huſband; for while Mr. Puffum, and his fooliſh vain wife, were ſquandering away an eſtate in idleneſs and vanity, Mr. and Mrs. Worthy were reaping the fruits of their induſtry and economy in the increaſe of their eſtate, and in the peace and tranquillity of their houſe. They ſaw new beauties every day in their children, and had the ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſfaction of ſeeing that their care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction were not loſt upon them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed to good purpoſe. Mrs. Worthy agreed with her huſband in the general plan of educating their children, which made this important branch of duty go on with more eaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:025609_0078_0FCE1090CD2EADF8"/>
In the perſonal appearance of Mrs. Worthy there was ſomething extremely pleaſing and intereſting. It was ſuch as made impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions favorable to her character at firſt view, and gave you the idea of a reſpectable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try gentlewoman. Her countenance was the index of a cheerful, modeſt, contented mind. It beſpoke the ſenſibility and benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of her heart. Such indeed was her character. Tho ſhe had many difficulties to grapple with at their firſt ſetting out in the world, yet ſhe was always cheerful, and never repined at any thing. Some will make a bad matter worſe by fretting, and ſo create many unneceſſary evils by refuſing to be patient under thoſe which are unavoidable: and will not enjoy any thing becauſe they cannot have every thing. But Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy had more prudence and goodneſs than thus to diſturb her own, and her huſband's peace of mind. Indeed ſhe had ſuch an example of it in her neighbor, Mrs. Grudges, and of the ill effects of it in their family, that this, if nothing elſe, was enough to make her ſick of it. But Mrs. Worthy would often ſay—" If I can diſcharge my duty, I am not anxious about my condition, nor do I think it worth while to pine for what I have not, ſince I have enough to ſatiſfy all
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:025609_0079_0FCE10924D271C78"/>
my real wants, and doubt not but by our induſtry and prudence we ſhall have things comfortable about us after a while."</p>
               <p>She was a perſon of great ſenſibility, and took great pleaſure in helping the poor and needy. Touched with the diſtreſſes of others, ſhe would ſpare no pains to relieve them. She would go by day and by night among her ſick and diſtreſſed neighbors. The poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort of them often experienced the effects of her benevolent heart in their ſickneſs, by the comfortable things ſhe would prepare and carry to them, for ſhe never went among them on ſuch occaſions bare handed. In this reſpect ſhe was a bleſſing highly to be prized. How much does ſuch a neighbor, who is kind and helpful, contribute to lighten the burden of life, and to promote its enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Such was the conduct of Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, that all the neighbors who had any grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude were loud in her praiſe. There are ſome to be found in moſt places who have envious diſpoſitions, who cannot bear to ſee others proſper, nor to hear them ſpoken well of. They ſeem to think it is a reflection upon themſelves, and therefore will ſay hard things of them. This was remarkably the caſe with their neighbor Grudges, whom I had occaſion to mention before. She was not
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025609_0080_0FCE1094228C0A38"/>
fretful, but envious to a great degree, and indeed I am inclined to think that they both proceed from the ſame cauſe. This old vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago would always rail at Mrs. Worthy whenever ſhe heard others ſpeaking in her praiſe. "For my part, ſhe would ſay, I don't know as how ſhe's any better than ſome other foks. Some people loves to go galloping about from one place to another, ſo they can get a little praiſe, but others are obliged to ſtay to home, and keep to work. For my part I an't agoing to ſay nothing about any nabors. She may be well enough and good enough—but then—I know what I know." Theſe oblique hints and flings are no uncommon things among envious and reſtleſs people. They are like dark clouds that only ſhow their grim edge above the horizon when they ſend forth diſtant flaſhes of lightning, and muttering thunder. Her ſpeeches had no more effect on Mrs. Worthy, than ſuch diſtant thunder has on our ſpirits. Whenever ſhe heard of Mrs. Grudge's fooliſh talk (and there are tale bearers enough in every place to carry ſuch intelligence) ſhe would only reply that "She was but doing her duty in endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oring to ſerve her neighbors, and the more good it was in her power to do them, the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025609_0081_0FCE1095D860D070"/>
better and happier ſhe felt. Mrs. Worthy's goodneſs was not to be reſtrained, or divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the folly of this ill humored woman, for when ſhe fell ſick of a fever and ſtood in need of the aſſiſtance of her neighbors, Mrs. Worthy was among the firſt to viſit her, and to do every thing ſhe could for her relief and comfort. This was rendering good for evil, and heaping coals of fire upon her head, which was the beſt poſſible retaliation. By this kind of revenge, we gain the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and moſt honorable conqueſt over our adverſaries.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. Further account of Mrs. Worthy—Of Mrs. Straton—Anecdote of her.—Of Mrs. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris—A wiſe obſervation of her's.</head>
               <p>IF we now take a view of Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy's domeſtic character, we ſhall find that her kind and obliging manners abroad were not the effects of oſtentation, nor a deſire to gain a character abroad that ſhe did not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port at home. This is too often the caſe both with men and women. They ſhow their good or ill breeding abroad, but their good or ill nature they ſhow at home. She was indeed one of Solomon's virtuous wives, whoſe excellencies he beautifully deſcribes in the thirty firſt chapter of Proverbs. "She looked well to the ways of her houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and did not eat the bread of idleneſs. Her children roſe up and called her bleſſed; her huſband alſo, and he praiſed her." Mr. Worthy was the happy man who found the ineſtimable prize which royal wiſdom ſays "is above rubies." He had ſenſe enough to diſcern it, and goodneſs enough to acknowledge it too, which is not always the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025609_0083_0FCE10989F66BDF8"/>
caſe with men who have good wives. Mrs. Worthy carried cleanlineſs to the higheſt pitch. She was of a very oppoſite opinion to thoſe who ſay that ſluts make the beſt butter. Every thing was in place—no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion—no diſorder; every thing was bright and clean. This nice method and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in her houſe enabled her to go on with her buſineſs to the beſt advantage. The want of this method is the occaſion of that hurly burly and confuſion which we ſee in ſome houſes. There was an extraordinary inſtance of it in Mrs. Straton's houſe. Here every thing was out of place, and the houſe up in arms. It was in all reſpects a contraſt to Mrs. Worthy's.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of her perſon, becauſe it had become ſo diſguſting to her huſband on account of her careleſs, ſluttiſh appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Before marriage her outſide appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was as good as any one in the circle of her acquaintance; but after marriage, ſhe grew very careleſs about her perſon, and from that to downright ſluttiſhneſs. This is a very imprudent thing in a female, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it diguſts the man whoſe affections and eſteem ſhe ſhould always ſtudy to preſerve; and by preſerving them, ſhe ſecures an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over him which ſhe can't acquire by
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025609_0084_0FCE109A0E37F420"/>
any other means. There are many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men being driven to taverns, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, which they never would have gone into, had they not found their own houſes become ſo diſagreeable to them through the imprudence of their wives. This was not the caſe, indeed, with Mrs. Straton's huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. He was a man of too much virtue, and had too much regard for his children to give way to theſe vices. But it was always a ſore mortification to him that his wife was ſuch a ſlattern. A friend of his called upon him one day when he was abſent from home. Mrs. Straton came to the door in her uſual diſhabille. Though well acquainted with her huſband, he had no knowledge of her, and ſuppoſing her to be the ſervant maid, he aſked her if Mr. Straton was at home. She ſaid he was not. "Will you deſire Mrs. Straton to come to the door?" ſaid the gentleman. "I am ſhe, inſtead of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter," replied Mrs. Straton, with an aukward curteſy. Her perſonal appearance was a true picture of the houſe within. Here every thing was at ſixes and ſevens. Her kitchen and parlour were nearly akin to the earth, and all things were of a piece. It was her miſfortune that ſhe had not been trained to neatneſs when a child, nor accuſtomed to
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025609_0085_0FCE109B6676BDA0"/>
order and method when young. In that gay period, her outſide appearance was as her houſe now is, painted without, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean within. Her dairy room<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Deane, in his excellent treatiſe on huſbandry, entitled "The New England Farmer," has given ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections on this head, which are worthy the attention of all farmers. The occupation of making butter and cheeſe from milk, he juſtly conſiders as a critical part of the farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's buſineſs: and that unleſs his wife or houſe keeper is very diligent and induſtrious, and ſees minutely to the dairy her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it will prove unprofitable. The cows muſt be milked at an early hour, and the utmoſt cleanlineſs obſerved. In order to preſerve the temperature of the air in the dairy room, our ingenious author obſerves, "A room in the cellar may be kept ſo nearly of an equal coolneſs, that the milk will neither grow ſour in ſummer nor freeze in winter; ſo that nothing will obſtruct the riſing of the cream. There ſhould be win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows on the northern ſide. Theſe ſhould be opened in the cooleſt of the mornings in ſummer to let in freſh air. The room ſhould be plaiſtered and whitewaſhed, to increaſe the light and prevent inſects. Every part ſhould be extremely clear and ſweet, and nothing ſhould enter into it which can corrupt the air."</note> was of a piece with the reſt, and almoſt ſpoiled what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was put into it. Her huſband kept a large number of cows, but could have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle benefit from them, as the moſt of whatever went into the houſe was ſquandered away and loſt. Her huſband would ſometimes complain that he had not as much butter and cheeſe for market as ſome of his neighbors who had fewer cows. This would ſet her
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025609_0086_0FCE109CCBFD84E0"/>
ſcolding at the children and maid for waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the milk and butter. Her children were dirty and ragged. They were taught noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but by hard blows. Their meals were never regular, and ſeldom in ſeaſon, and when brought on table, they appeared fitter for ſome other kind of animals than for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures.</p>
               <p>I will now turn from ſo diſguſting a ſight to a character more deſerving attention. Mrs. Harris, a native of Ireland, came over with her parents when quite young. Her parents acquired a decent living in the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern part of New Jerſey, where they ſettled at their firſt coming over. They were good ſort of people, and endeavored to bring up Nelle, their only daughter, as well as they poſſibly could. At the age of about two and twenty, ſhe married Mr. J. Harris, a wealthy farmer in New England, and was remarkable for good management. It was a maxim with her, that "to know the true character of the miſtreſs of the houſe, you muſt go into her garret and cellar." This worthy woman lived to a great age, an example of piety to her maker, of good order in her affairs, and of kindneſs to her fellow creatures. She lived much reſpected, and died greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by all who knew her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:025609_0087_0FCE109E4D2A6068"/>
Mrs. Worthy practiſed upon Mrs. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris's maxim, and was never aſhamed to have any part of her houſe viſited by the beſt judges of good economy and cleanlineſs at all times. Nor was ſhe aſhamed to appear if her friends called ſuddenly upon her at any time. Her dreſs was always neat though plain, and indeed ſhe gloried in being dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the manufacture of her own hands. I ſhall reſerve for the next chapter an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of an incident which repreſented her in an amiable point of light, and brought to view many good qualities which were well deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in a letter to a friend.</p>

               <p>ON a certain day when the ſun ſhone with uncommon brightneſs, and every thing ſeemed placid and ſerene, a ſtranger rode up to the door and diſmounted. Mr. Worthy was in the field attending to his buſineſs there. Mrs. Worthy was employed at the ſame time about her dairy, and was dreſſed ſuitably to her employment. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was well dreſt, knocked at the door, but without waiting for any ceremony, went in, and obſerving the door open that led into the kitchen, he went directly for that. Here he found Mrs. Worthy engaged in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment juſt mentioned. Such a viſitor coming in ſo unexpectedly, and quite a ſtranger, ſeemed a little to diſconcert and embarraſs her at firſt, for ſhe was a very modeſt woman. However, ſhe ſoon recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected herſelf, and conſidered that ſhe was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her duty, and was dreſt in character;
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025609_0089_0FCE10A20DCBE7F8"/>
and ſaid to the gentleman, who inquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr. Worthy, "if you will pleaſe to walk into the other room, ſir, I will ſend for Mr. Worthy, who is not far off," and told Dilla, her maid, to ſhow the gentleman to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. "If you pleaſe, Madam, ſaid he, I will ſit here a little while, your kitchen is clean enough for me, and I have a curioſity to ſee the operation of this buſineſs, for I have never ſeen a cheeſe made in my life."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Worthy went on with her work, and he ſat till ſhe had completed it, aſking many queſtions about it without diſcovering his name, and ſhe had too much modeſty and good breeding to aſk<note n="*" place="bottom">The practice of aſking ſtrangers their names is ſaid to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be peculiar to New England; and it is the ſubject of much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ridicule among foreigners—who are probably guilty of ſome other practices as ridiculous.</note> it of him. At length he ſaid to her "I perceive Madam, that I am quite a ſtranger to you; but as I am about to purchaſe a farm, that I may retire from the noiſe and hurry of the town, I have made a journey to this part of the country, of which we hear great fame; and as far as I have ſeen, I think it anſwers the deſcription given of it. I have called to take advice of Mr. Worthy, and hope to have the happineſs to live not far from you." She could not all this time diſcover who he was.

She again deſired him to walk into the other room, which he did; and ſtepping into an adjoining room, ſhe adjuſted her clothes, and ſoon appeared with great propriety. He then inquired whether ſhe did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect a diſtant relation of her father who lived at <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, who was the bearer of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by which they received the firſt account of her brother's being wounded in an action with the Indians, and on the recovery. Mrs. Worthy replied that "ſhe remembered it perfectly well, and never ſhould forget the joy which was ſpread through the houſe on that occaſion; and that ſhe now recollected him by the ſcar in his forehead, which he had received in the early part of that cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign." A number of years, which alters every thing, had paſſed over ſince that time, and Mrs. Worthy had no other knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of him afterwards except that ſhe had heard that he was a merchant of ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction at <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>. After expreſſing her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at ſeeing him again, and mutual inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after each others' welfare, he propoſed to take a view of her houſe if it was agreeable, ſaying, "he perceived they had gotten things well about them." There are few women who could conduct with more dignity on ſuch an occaſion. She ſeemed conſcious
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:025609_0091_0FCE10A840155108"/>
that there could not be any thing in the plain ſtile of their houſe that could gratify the taſte of a perſon of his figure, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any apologies, which the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pride often dictates, ſhe calmly told him "that they had nothing but what was in a farmer's ſtile, and if it would be any gratification to him ſhe would with pleaſure go over the houſe and ſhow him the few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies they enjoyed." When they had gone through, and returned to the ſitting room, he gave Mrs. Worthy high applauſe for the order, ſimplicity and neatneſs which appeared through the whole; and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the many conveniences which Mr. Worthy's ingenuity had added to his houſe. Mrs. Worthy obſerved to him "that as to wine they did not pretend to it; but that ſhe could give him ſome mead, of her own make, from the honey of bees which Mr. Worthy had taken in the woods. He accepted a little of it, and declared to her that he thought it the fineſt he had ever taſted in his life. Mr. Worthy happening to come in at this time, and being introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mrs. Worthy to Mr. Blanford, for that was his name, the converſation turned on other ſubjects for a while. But Mr. Blanford, who had been aſked to renew his
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025609_0092_0FCE10A998250BA8"/>
draught of the mead, inquired how it was made, and in what manner the honey was taken of which it was made. Mr. Worthy cited him to his wife for an account of the manner of making the mead; and gave him the following account of the manner in which he took the bees in the woods.</p>
               <p>"At the time when the cells are fulleſt of honey, I prepare the neceſſary material for diſcovering their retreat, and gathering their rich and uſeful ſtores, which are much more profitable than is generally thought for; and though fatiguing, yet I am commonly rewarded for my labor. Beſides the proviſion I carry for my own uſe, and a ſmall pocket compaſs to direct my courſe, I take with me ſome wax and honey. With theſe articles I go into the woods, where I generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſome bees in motion. I obſerve the courſe they ſteer, and follow them; and ſometimes diſcover their lodgment in this way, among large old trees. If I ſee no bees, I endeavor to draw their attention to me by burning ſome wax on a hot ſtone; the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the wax will ſoon bring a number of them together. When theſe have loaded themſelves they fly off to make a depoſit of what they have gathered. They return for more, and ſo on till they have taken all the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025609_0093_0FCE10AD537AADD8"/>
bait I have laid for them. I am particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in obſerving their different courſes; and by theſe means I ſeldom fail of finding their ſtore houſes. Thus I ſometimes find ſeveral ſwarms in one excurſion, and mark the trees which contain them, that I may return home, and bring proper aſſiſtance for conveying the honey to my own houſe. The quantity, ſaid Mr. Worthy, that is contained in ſome of theſe large limbs, or trunks of trees, is truly aſtoniſhing, and leaves me no doubt but this is the moſt profitable game our farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can hunt for, who live near to the woods. To ſhew you, continued he, the prolific and beneficial effects of this little induſtrious creature, I can aſſure you that the firſt ſwarm I ever found in the woods was by accident, in the month of April, in a large hollow limb, which I ſawed off and placed it in the ſame poſition at home, and from that I had five ſwarms that year."</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanford was pleaſed with this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and obſerved that tho man was able by ſtratagem, to detect them in their retreat, yet that the induſtry, good order and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the bees were admonitions to man for his diſpoſition to idleneſs, and his inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to order and regularity at home, and his want of ſubmiſſion to government
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025609_0094_0FCE10AF285E59C0"/>
abroad. But, like man, continued Mr. Blanford, they are liable to be corrupted, and become indolent when placed in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation where induſtry is not neceſſary to their preſervation.</p>
               <p>He then related the ſtory of "A Dutch merchant who was ſettled at Batavia, a large and flouriſhing town in the iſland of Java, and the capital of all the Dutch ſettlements in the Eaſt Indies. This gentleman ſent for a hive of young bees from Poland, a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom far to the northward, to this warm and fertile place. This he did with a view to multiply the breed of this induſtrious inſect, and regale himſelf with honey prepared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his own inſpection. The bees were placed in a large and beautiful garden, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the richeſt profuſion of fragrant herbs and flowers. Plenty ſoon corrupted their diſpoſition to labor, and the ſtock of honey which they collected, during the firſt months of their ſettlement, was of little value.—The expected winter did not enſue, and as they continued to enjoy abundance in this happy climate, they became improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of futurity, and were no longer at pains to ſtore their cells with that food which bountiful nature at all ſeaſons provided for them. Thus unfavorable was exceſſive
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:025609_0095_0FCE10B055173B20"/>
abundance to the admired virtues of the bee. And no leſs injurious to many a well form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed youth, is that affluence which hath been heaped together by parental toil, to gratify parental ambition; but which ſerves either to nouriſh ſloth, by ſuperſeding the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of application; or to promote diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and profligacy of manners, by giving a falſe direction to activity." The danger of this, Mr. Blanford aſſured Mrs. Worthy, was with him a very powerful reaſon for wiſhing to retire from a great and luxurious town, to the enjoyment of the more innocent and peaceful pleaſures of a country life. This gentleman was ſo pleaſed with what he ſaw at Mr. Worthy's, that he gave a partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular deſcription of it in a letter to his friend, which ſhall appear in the next chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. Mr. Blanford's letter, deſcriptive of Mrs. Worthy—her houſe, children, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>WHEN Mr. Blanford had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed his purpoſe in calling on Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, he took his leave of the family, with many thanks for their civilities, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home. Soon after his return, he wrote a very deſcriptive letter to a friend of his, who had ridiculed his idea of exchanging the pleaſures of the city for thoſe of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This letter contains ſo many uſeful obſervations and ſentiments, as to merit a place here, notwithſtanding his going into many minute circumſtances that may not appear of importance.</p>
               <p>Having made ſome very judicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the different modes of living and enjoyment in the town and in the country, he goes on to ſay—"In the tour I lately made into the country I met with many pleaſing ſcenes, and innocent enjoyments; but I think none of them equalled what I ſaw at Mr. Worthy's.</p>
               <p>The neatneſs of Mrs. Worthy's perſon was but a ſample of the neatneſs of her houſe. Such order and regularity in the family,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:025609_0098_0FCE116B0BA239C8"/>
ſuch clean floors and utenſils, ſuch fragrance through the houſe, from the freſh flowers which decorated the chimnies, and from the neighboring fields, which were now in a high ſtate of cultivation, made me in love with a farmer's life, and confirmed me in my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions ſoon to enjoy it. I am ſo charmed with Mrs. Worthy's economy and good houſewifry, that I am tempted to give you a particular account of the houſe and furniture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Worthy's houſe conſiſted of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious kitchen, with a good pantry and waſh houſe adjoining, and an excellent dairy room. The parlour was a neat mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſized room. The dining, or family room, was large and convenient, ceiled up at the ſides, and ornamented with clean white ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and with chairs bottomed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bark of elm, which Mr. Worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me was more durable than flag. The cupboard, which was filled with the common utenſils of the family, was plain, but clean. The kitchen, with every thing in it, appeared clean as our parlours. Her beſt room was as pleaſant as it was neat. The two windows, that looked into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, were ornamented on the outſide with a honeyſuckle, a ſweetbrier, a roſe tree and a jeſſamine. The curtains were of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:025609_0099_0FCE10B7CD4C9250"/>
red and white check, which Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy had made in the houſe. The ſhovel, tongs and handirons, were all of a piece with the reſt. Under the window ſtood a large maple table, which for its bright poliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the looking glaſs which hung over it. On the other ſide was a cane couch, with cuſhions of patch work, made out of the bits which Mrs. Worthy had ſewed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while ſhe was young, and ſix chairs of the ſame kind. Several cheap prints hung round the room. Mr. Worthy was of opinion that the heart might be more or leſs affected by them. He therefore had procured thoſe that repreſented our Saviour's birth and paſſion, the prodigal ſon, &amp;c. In the other room he had the induſtrious apprentice, and pictures repreſenting ſheep-ſhearing, a farm yard and a harveſt field. Theſe ſerved at leaſt for amuſement to the children. The parlour chamber was much in the ſame ſtile of the parlour, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a bed of furniture check. There was no toilet at which our ladies ſpend ſo much of their time, but a little white table covered with a napkin. The other cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers contained nothing worthy of notice, except the plain neatneſs that appeared there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:025609_0100_0FCE10B9567A9BB0"/>
You will, my dear ſir, naturally expect me to aſcend from theſe leſs important mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Mrs. Worthy's children. The eldeſt, a daughter, named Dorcas, about fourteen, was gone to the weaver's with yarn of her own ſpinning, for a piece of diaper. The ſecond, a ſon about twelve years old, was in the field with his father. He was named Henry Smith. The third, a ſon in his elev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enth year, was weeding in the garden. The fourth, a daughter, almoſt nine, was aſſiſting her mother. The fifth, a daughter, about ſeven, was ſitting on a form, knitting. The ſixth, a ſon about five, was ſitting by his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a little book in his hand, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much engaged in reading. Thus were they all employed, and each one ſeemed ſteady and intent upon their reſpective em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. As I was ſitting, and obſerving the little brood acting under maternal direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſaw the little boy whiſpering to his ſiſter, and had the curioſity to liſten to what he was telling her, and was delighted with the following dialogue between them. "Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſiſter, ſaid he, I am glad my name is Joſeph." "Why are you glad of that Joſe," ſaid the little ſiſter? "Becauſe, ſaid he, Joſeph was a good man, and did a great deal of good. He was juſt like my Daddy,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:025609_0101_0FCE10BB16689280"/>
he gave away his corn to the poor folks who had'nt got any, and kept a great many poor little children from ſtarving." This ſpeech almoſt brought tears in his little ſiſter's eyes, and ſhe replied with conſiderable emotion, "Well, I am glad my name is Mary too, for Mary was a very good woman, and ſaid her prayers every night and every morning. She loved every body that was good, and never did any wicked things, and ſhe took good care of poor ſick folks, as Mamma al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways does." I perceived by this converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he was reading an abridgement of the hiſtory of Joſeph, and on inquiry I found the little girl had been reading ſome account of Mary. They were both impreſt with the characters of which they had been read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and were deſirous of being like them. "Siſter, ſaid the little boy, if you are good now, you will be as good as ſhe was when you are grown up to be a woman; for Mamma ſays, the way to be good when we are grown up, is to be good when we are little—Think I ſhall ever be as big as Joſeph was?" "It is no matter, the little Mary replied, whether you ever be as big or not, if you are but as good as he; for I have heard Mamma ſay, that folks may be very good if they are not grown ſo big as other folks. She ſays that Mary Doſſet, the poor
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:025609_0102_0FCE10BCC5A480F8"/>
little old woman that comes here ſometimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a good woman; and therefore that we muſt not laugh at her becauſe ſhe is deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is'nt as big as other folks."</p>
               <p>I was delighted with this dialogue, which had been carried on in ſo loud a whiſper as to attract our attention, and with ſo much earneſtneſs that they did not perceive our noticing them until it was ended, when they returned to their reſpective employments: How happy muſt theſe parents be? They ſee virtue blooming in the early ſpring of life. They behold in their children that which will be the conſolation of declining years to their parents; and the perpetual ſource of ſatisfaction to themſelves. They perceive their hearts forming to virtuous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and hopeful characters.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given you ſome faint deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of farmer Worthy's domeſtic ſtate. If you enjoy the deſcription as much as I did the ſight, your pleaſure is very great. I have long mixed in the buſtle and hurry of the town. I have moved in polite circles, and in many of the gay ſcenes of life; but till now I never diſcovered the reſort of peace, the reſidence of contentment, and of true felicity.

               <p>As an evidence of his good opinion of Mrs. Worthy, he made her his almoner, by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conſiderable ſum of money in her hands, to be diſtributed among ſome poor families who had been driven in from the frontiers by the ſavages, and were juſt arrived in their neighborhood, whoſe diſtreſsful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances Mrs. Worthy had repreſented in the courſe of converſation, in a very pathetic manner. No ſooner had Mr. Blanford taken his departure, than Mrs. Worthy went to viſit thoſe ſcenes of diſtreſs, and to afford relief to the ſufferers. She heartily rejoiced with them in the ſeaſonable relief which that gentleman's bounty enabled her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon them. Nor was ſhe ſatisfied with being the bearer of his bounty to them, but

added ſomething of her own to it. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could have been more opportune to thoſe in diſtreſs, than this unexpected ſuccour, nor more pleaſing to Mrs. Worthy, than to be made the inſtrument of it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Of Farmer Worthy, contraſted with Mr. Slack—A gentleman falls from his horſe—Of Mr. and Mrs. Belmont.</head>
               <p>IT is now time to take a more partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular view of farmer Worthy in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his family and affairs. He purſued his occupation with great induſtry; and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpring he had the ſatisfaction to ſee his graſs grow thicker by means of the manure and tillage he beſtowed upon the ground; and it is an old ſaying that "he is the beſt man in the kingdom who can make two ſpears of graſs grow where but one grew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore." He ſaw his ſtock encreaſing, and every thing about him growing into better order and greater plenty. So that he could now guard againſt the evils of a drought by the remaining ſtores of a former crop. His circumſtances were flouriſhing and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but his proſperity had not the effect which it too often produces. It makes ſome haughty and proud, others again it fills with covetous, avaricious deſires, while it makes a third ſort fond of living too freely; they
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025609_0106_0FCE10C3B5E7A308"/>
run into luxury and extravagance, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come negligent of their affairs. But it would be difficult to deſcribe with what gratitude farmer Worthy, and his wife, received the numerous bleſſings which a bountiful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhowered down upon them. They ever expreſſed their thankfulneſs to the giver by an increaſing zeal in his ſervice. They delighted more and more in keeping his ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, in ſetting a good example, in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God with their houſehold, and in teaching them to know and fear the giver of all good things.</p>
               <p>The caſe was very different with Mr. Slack who had been a farmer of conſiderable proſperous circumſtances while he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed induſtrious and prudent. But when he had got into a good way for living, he began to grow vain and notional, and thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above labor. So that he preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>became as negligent of his affairs out of the houſe as his wife was within; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he hired ſoon became as careleſs and negligent as himſelf. The conſequence of this was, that his affairs all went into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in a ſhort time. His fences became bad, his cattle deſtroyed his corn and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and did great damage to his neighbors' fields. He would patch up his fence ſaying,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:025609_0107_0FCE10C5D68DA2C8"/>
"That will do for the preſent." But this was only a trap and a ſnare. By theſe means he loſt his grain, and injured his neighbors', inſomuch that his crops made a poor appearance, while farmer Worthy's came in plentifully. This apparant differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence raiſed the envy of Mr. Slack; and his wife's envy was excited by the notice that was taken of Mrs. Worthy who paſſed that way, while ſhe and her huſband were deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all ranks of people. They incurred the contempt and ridicule of the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and faſhionable people by their affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of grandeur, and the hatred of many of the poorer but virtuous people by their injuſtice and want of kindneſs, for they were as careleſs about paying their debts as they were inattentive to their own affairs. They withheld the wages of the labourer, and ground the face of the poor. This was a very wicked thing in him, becauſe the labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is worthy of his hire; and he needs it who depends on his daily labor to furniſh his daily bread. Under the Jewiſh econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my it was a divine ordinance that the wages of a laboring man ſhould not be detained over night.

In farmer Worthy we ſee every thing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. His affairs were all in the exacteſt order, and he loſt nothing by careleſſneſs. His hired men were well treated and punctually paid, his fields and meadows were put into the beſt order, his fences were ſeaſonably repaired, ſo that neither his own nor his neighbors' grain ſuffered by his cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. They were well fed and tenderly uſed, for he was a very humane as well as honeſt man, and delighted in ſeeing every creature about him happy. He uſed often to ſay that "he thought it was very neceſſary to have laws for the protection of the dumb beaſts from the tyranny of cruel men, for that they were not given to us that we might vent our paſſions upon them in abuſes and ill uſage." Thoſe who lived in his houſe, and labored in his fields, never failed to go away pleaſed with the treatment they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both from him and Mrs. Worthy. They were always pleaſed with the order that run through the family, and particularly ſo with his management among them.</p>
               <p>An incident that gave Mr. Worthy an opportunity of diſcovering the goodneſs of his heart, and opening the way to a more thorough knowledge of his domeſtic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, deſerves notice in this place. A gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:025609_0109_0FCE10C855D9F6B0"/>
by the name of Belmont met with a moſt terrible fall from his horſe as he was journeying near Mr. Worthy's. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted horſe drew the rider ſome diſtance by the ſtirrup, till that giving way left him in the road. Mr. Worthy, who had been witneſs to the diſaſter, run with all ſpeed to his relief. He was much injured by the fall, and at firſt ſeemed breathleſs, but on being carried into the houſe and laid on a bed, he began to diſcover ſigns of life, and by the aid of ſome cool water, and chafing in the hands, he ſo far recovered by the time the phyſician came, as to inform who he was and from whence he came.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable that Mr. Belmont, who had always lived in the town, conceived a very unfavourable opinion of the country people; he thought them ill natured and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of humanity; and had therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diſſuade Mr. Blanford from any thoughts of a country life. An unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate event had now thrown him into the hands of a man whoſe higheſt ambition it was to merit the ſtyle of <hi>farmer,</hi> and where he was likely to be detained ſome time to experience the hoſpitality of a farmer's houſe. As this was the caſe, he propoſed to Mr. and Mrs. Worthy, ſending for his wife, if agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:025609_0110_0FCE10CC49DC6A00"/>
to them. To his propoſal they cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſented, ſaying, "that they were but plain farmers, and if Mrs. Belmont could put up with their way of living they ſhould be glad to ſee her." She was accordingly ſent for, and in due time ſhe arrived. It was an unfortunate circumſtance that Mrs. Belmont was wholly unacquainted with a country life. Being ſomewhat of a haughty woman too, and but little diſpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the manners of others, ſhe diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſigns of diſlike on her arrival and looked awry at every thing ſhe ſaw.—"Such ſtuff," ſhe would ſay of the ſalt beef and pork, &amp;c. that was brought upon table for dinner, "may do well enough for people in the country who work for their living, but it is enough to kill thoſe who have been uſed to delicate living."</p>
               <p>Mr. Belmont bore the pain of his wounds, and the operation of dreſſing them, with great patience; but the follies of his wife were inſupportable. She had enough of that kind of breeding which taught her to move gracefully in a polite circle, but had not ſenſe enough to know that true polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſted in behaving well to every body. Mr. Belmont began by this time to looſe his former prejudices againſt country
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:025609_0111_0FCE10CD940ED3A0"/>
people and farmers. He experienced ſo much hoſpitality from Mr. and Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that he endeavoured to ſolve their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by gentle words and grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments. Being a well bred man, he knew how to make allowances for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the manners of people and of their living. Things continued in this way for ſome time, till at length Mr. Belmont had ſo far recovered of his wounds as to think of endeavouring to return home. He therefore deſired Mr. Worthy to let him know what compenſation he ſhould make them for the trouble he had occaſioned, and the many civilities he had received dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his confinement.—"I have no demand upon you, Sir, ſaid Mr. Worthy; I conſider it my duty to regard with care the diſtreſſes of others. By ſerving you Sir, I have had no view to my own benefit. It is not in your power to add any thing to the pleaſure I feel from having had it in my power to afford you relief." Mr. Belmont was amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the nobleneſs of his ſpirit and the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his attitude on this occaſion; but could not prevail on him to accept any thing as a compenſation. And as to Mrs. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, ſhe was quite overcome by this act of generoſity. Her own follies recurred upon
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:025609_0112_0FCE10CF1C22E950"/>
her mind with redoubled force, and quite put her to the bluſh. Every thing being prepared for their journey, they took an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate leave, with ideas of the farmers very different from thoſe they entertained before this event took place. Mrs. Belmont could not help being affected, touched and impreſſed, by the unaffected hoſpitality with which they had been treated, and ſent Mrs. Worthy ſome handſome preſents. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſentiments both of them entertained of the farmers in general, and the high opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion they formed of Mr. Worthy and family, are expreſſed by Mr. Belmont, in a letter to Mr. Blanford, ſoon after his recovery.</p>

               <p>DURING Mr. Belmont's confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had opportunity for many reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and being out of the noiſe of the town, they took a turn different from what they probably would have done if he had been ſurrounded by his friends in the gay ſcenes of life. In this calm retreat he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template things in a more cool and rational light. To a mind thus at liberty to judge of things as they really are, there are many things in the faſhionable circles of great towns which will appear fooliſh and vain. The reaſon of their not appearing ſo to thoſe who are in the giddy round is, that they do not ſtop long enough at any one point to view them in a cool and deliberate manner. Mr. Belmont ſeems to have been brought to a ſtand long enough for this purpoſe, and to have turned his mind to this ſubject with ſome attention, and his obſervations on this ſubject appear to be pertinent and good.</p>

In our towns, ſaid he, where parade and ſhow are every thing, faſhionable dreſs is conſidered as one of the moſt important things in life. There are few who ſeem to pay any regard to the diſtinction of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as they reſpect virtue and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In this ſentiment our young men are confirmed by moſt of the young ladies with whom they converſe. But whatever may be the ideas of the faſhionable part of the world about theſe things, and about the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful virtues of life, ſuch as induſtry, ſobriety and economy, I am convinced that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies can only be ſupplied with food and neceſſaries by a conſtant aſſiduity in cultivating the earth, and providing for their mutual wants. By labor every thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; without labor the moſt fertile fields would ſoon be overrun with foreſts, the fineſt meadows become ſtagnant waters, or wild and unyielding thickets, the flocks would run wild and be uſeleſs. I therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that labor is the firſt and moſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty of man, from which no one can have a right entirely to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If therefore there is any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one human being and another, that part of them muſt be the moſt valuable who cultivate the ground, and provide neceſſaries

                  </note> This may ſeem ſtrange language from one who has lived as I have done. But I find that a retired and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative view of the faſhionable world, gives me an opinion of it very different from that which we poſſeſs while mixing in it. When I ſee thoſe careſſed as polite people, who trouble themſelves little about their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and leſs about their morals, are paſſionate, haughty, capricious, ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their friends, diſobedient to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, every thing indeed which to plain ſenſe appears frivolous or contemptible, without incurring the leaſt imputation, provided they dreſs and appear faſhionably, and their politeneſs is not impeached by the ladies—when I ſee theſe things through the cool eye of reflection, I become more and more ſick of the faſhionable follies of the town, and more in love with the plain uncorrupted ſincerity, and genuine hoſpitality of the country.</p>

                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:025609_0116_0FCE10DA4E3D9970"/>
The late experience I have had of this, at Mr. Worthy's, has taught me a new leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and given me a ſpecimen of native good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and undiſtinguiſhed philanthropy. As I was on my return from viewing my eſtate in the weſt, my horſe took a ſudden fright, and went from under me ſo quick that I could not recover the ſaddle. My left foot ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the ſturrips, and I was dragged a conſiderable diſtance. The firſt thing that I can recollect after this dreadful fall, is that I was ſurrounded by a family whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate looks made a very deep impreſſion on my mind. The children were bathed in tears, at the ſight of a man torn and bloody as I was. One of the children, indeed, lay very ſick at the time; but they ſeemed to forget their own diſtreſſes for the preſent, and to be wholly abſorbed by mine, which appeared ſo much greater. The noble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited exertions of Mr. Worthy on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, convinced me that true elevation of mind might be found among farmers; and reminded me of the conduct of Sir Philip Sidney, in the battle near Zutphen, in the Low Countries. He was one of the brighteſt ornaments of Queen Elizabeth's court, and was a perſon of equal bravery and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In the above mentioned action, he

                  </gap> courage. Having loſt two horſes under him, as he was mounting the third, an unlucky ſhot from the enemy's trenches broke his thigh. He returned to the camp, which was ſome diſtance off, on horſeback. Being faint and parched with thirſt through fatigue and the loſs of blood, he called for ſome water, which was preſently brought him; but juſt as he was raiſing the veſſel to his mouth to drink, a poor wounded ſoldier, who happened at that inſtant to be carried by, looked up to it wiſhfully; the gallant generous Sidney took the cup from his mouth before he had taſted the water, and gave it to the ſuffering ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, ſaying, "Thy neceſſities are greater than mine."<note n="*" place="bottom">"Sir Philip was conveyed to Anhelm, and attended by the principal ſurgeons of the camp. During ſixteen days, great hopes were entertained of his recovery; but the ball not being extracted, and a mortification enſuing, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelf for death with the utmoſt piety and fortitude, and expired on the ſeventeenth of October, 1586, in the thirty ſecond year of his age. He is ſaid to have taken leave of his brother in theſe affecting terms.—Love my memory, cheriſh my friends, their fidelity to me may aſſure you that they are honeſt. But above all, govern your will and affections by the will and word of your Creator; in me beholding the end of this world, with all her vanities."</note>
               </p>
               <p>This was an example, not only of the greateſt virtue and humanity, but alſo of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:025609_0118_0FCE10E01D0638B8"/>
that elevated method of thinking which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the true gentleman, whether he be a farmer or a profeſſional man. For what is it that gives a ſuperiority of manners, but the inclination to ſacrifice our own pleaſures and intereſts to the well being of others? An ordinary perſon might have pitied the poor ſoldier, or would have aſſiſted him, when he had firſt taken care of himſelf; but who, in ſuch a dreadful extremity as the brave Sidney was reduced to, would be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of even forgetting his own ſufferings to relive another, unleſs he had acquired the generous habit of always ſlighting his own gratification for the ſake of his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
               <p>In Farmer Worthy I found all the marks of this ſame elevation of mind, which I think probable would have carried him to as great lengths of humanity and generoſity in ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumſtances. The goodneſs of his heart was expreſſed by an uninterrupted ſcene of kind actions, performed in ſo obliging a manner as ſeemed to double their value. But I do not intend to give you a detail of actions which related to myſelf only. The regularity of his proceeding in his family merits particular notice, and is worthy of the imitation of every one.</p>

No man could be more attentive to buſineſs than Mr. Worthy, yet this never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with the care of his children, nor the exemplary devotion of his houſe. In all his proceedings he obſerved method. This enabled him to have every thing move in its place and to preſerve peace in his family. In order to this he found it neceſſary to riſe early in the morning. In the winter ſeaſon the family were all up ſo as to unite in family devotions as ſoon as he could ſee to read in a large bible by day light. There was a dignity in his manner of attending this ſervice, far above what would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a man of his education and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, and a fervency in its performance which ſhewed that it was not a matter of habit, but of choice and pleaſure. To this very proper and uſeful exerciſe ſucceeded breakfaſt, and to that the buſineſs of the day, to which every one went as they were directed. No difficulty or oppoſition ever aroſe among any of them about the ſervices aſſigned them that I ever ſaw or heard. In the evening Mr. Worthy generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome time in reading, of which I perceived he was very fond. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would employ one of the children in reading for the common benefit. His
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:025609_0120_0FCE10E297A10AB0"/>
books I obſerved were all of a moral nature and tendency. The ſtories and characters they read would affect their minds and leave good impreſſions upon them. As Mr. Worthy began the day with God, ſo he cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by acknowledging him before his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This practice, beſides its being a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expreſſion of piety to God, had a good effect on the minds of his family, both by leading them to be pious, and by promoting affection and harmony among them. It tended alſo to inſpire benevolence for others, and eſpecially for the afflicted and diſtreſſed, for whom he always prayed moſt fervently. It had a good effect alſo in keeping the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily more together than they otherwiſe could have been, for the young people of the family were never out beyond that hour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on ſpecial occaſions. The ſame ſteady courſe carried him through the year, and all things proſpered well with him. The ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was alſo obſerved with great order and propriety. It was ſtrictly a day of reſt from all unneceſſary labor. Every thing was ſo adjuſted at the cloſe of the week as that the ſabbath might be obſerved in ſuch a manner as beſt to anſwer its deſign. Indeed, my dear Sir, I left this hoſpitable houſe with ideas of a farmer's houſe, and the advantages of
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:025609_0121_0FCE10E44210F610"/>
a country life, very different from thoſe I entertained before, and am perſuaded that true enjoyment depends not ſo much on any place or outward circumſtances as on the temper and diſpoſition of the mind, and the good habits which we cultivate. In this happy dwelling I found the poet's live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcription of the happineſs of a virtuous country life, ſo exactly verified, that I will cloſe my lengthy epiſtle with it."</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. Containing a further account of Mr. Slack—the fatal conſequences of intemperance—his death—Mr. Worthy's conduct with reſpect to him.</head>
               <p>IT was by means of this eſtabliſhed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſteady induſtry and frugality, that Mr. Worthy was able now to encreaſe his prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty from the produce of his farm; his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren grew up as olive plants round about him, and in all things he proſpered well. In the mean time Mr. Slack became unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in almoſt every thing. His produce was much of it loſt for want of being attended to in ſeaſon. In winter his cattle and ſheep died for want of care. His intereſt waſted away by degrees, till he got into debt, and this involved him in many difficulties. From theſe embarraſſments he might have extricated himſelf by induſtry and frugality; but inſtead of purſuing theſe meaſures to get out of his troubles, he began to drink hard. He would ſeldom paſs a tavern without ſtopping to drink; and to ſpend
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025609_0123_0FCE10E9B9FF7150"/>
his time and money, with idle and fooliſh people who followed a ſimilar practice. Sometimes he would come home quite in diſguiſe with liquor, and frequently at a late hour too, which made great confuſion in the houſe. His wife would find fault with him, and very juſtly too, for neglecting his buſineſs and waſting his ſubſtance; and for diſguiſing himſelf ſo too. He in turn would rail at her for deſſing ſo fine. So that they rendered each other very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. The conſequence was, that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren grew up like the wild aſſes' colt, and all their houſehold were at looſe ends. The ſabbath was regarded only as a day of idleneſs, and often produced ſcenes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance. Their children and hired peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple got into a habit of gaming and drinking; from thoſe they ſoon proceeded to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling and fighting. They would ride the horſes moſt cruelly to taverns and frolicks, and when they came home late at night, would turn them out to ſhiver in the cold without any proper care. Mr. Slack kept one horſe for his own uſe, in better order than the reſt. But when he is in his cups he would whip and ſpur him to ſhow his ſpirits, and would ride him on ſuch occaſions very hard. It happened, as he was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:025609_0124_0FCE10EAD3AB3F70"/>
his horſe in ſpirits when going to a tav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern where he expected to meet ſeveral tav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern haunters, his horſe ſtumbled over a roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtone, as he was in full gallop, whereby the rider was brought to the ground. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for Mr. Slack, the horſe rolled over him and broke his thigh very badly. The horſe ſprang up and ran home with all ſpeed; but Mr. Slack lay in a moſt terrible ſituation for ſome time. At length Mr. Worthy, who was on his way home from Mr. Jones', who was very ſick, and to whoſe neceſſities he had been adminiſtering, came to the place where Mr. Slack lay groaning in a moſt bitter manner. Mr. Worthy was much ſurprized to find him in this ſituation, and like the good Samaritan came to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. But as he could not do any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone he rode with great haſte to the neareſt houſe for help to aſſiſt in carrying him home. He groaned out many ill ſpeeches againſt the horſe, without recollecting the unprovoked blows and ſpurs he had given the poor creature. Mr. Worthy endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſoothe him, and to convey him along in the eaſieſt manner he poſſibly could. Mr. Slack was much ſurprized at his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs towards him, for he was conſcious of having done Mr. Worthy many injuries.
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:025609_0125_0FCE10EE49D9B2B0"/>
But Mr. Worthy never ſuffered anger to lodge in his breaſt. If he was at any time reviled, he did not revile in return, but would do good to thoſe who did evil to him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Slack was very much afflicted at ſeeing her huſband brought home in ſuch a plight. But Mr. Worthy comforted her by telling her that though it appeared to be a bad wound, yet that he hoped that it was not dangerous. He tried to aſſiſt the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in ſetting the bone; and during the time of his confinement both Mr. Worthy and his wife ſhowed great kindneſs by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſiting, and by aſſiſting in every way they could. They did not ſtand aloof as Mr. Emmons did, and forbid any of his family going near them becauſe he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at Mr. Slack. He ſeemed rather to rejoice at what had taken place than feel any ſympathy for him. Mrs. Slack now ſaw the error of her conduct toward Mr. and Mrs. Worthy, and was aſhamed of it. She ſaw that their humanity and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were not pretended but real virtues, and that they were not to be defeated by any injuries they had received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Slack continued to grow worſe till the ſurgeon found it abſolutely neceſſary to
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:025609_0126_0FCE10EF4CD09420"/>
cut off the limb in order to prevent a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. Tho this terrible operation was performed ſkillfully, yet a fever, occaſioned by the bad ſtate his blood was in through intemperance, ſeized him, and threatened his life. Mr. Worthy viſited him every day, and finding his fever rage to a high degree, he propoſed to Mr. Slack to ſend for Mr.—, the clergyman, to converſe and pray with him. But what can the preſence of a miniſter avail toward the ſalvation of a poor creature who has ſpent his days in vice and intemperance? Mr.—, however, came to viſit Mr. Slack, but found him in ſo broken a ſtate of mind as to be incapable of much converſation. He would attempt to ſay ſomething, but his diſtreſs and agony was ſo great that he was interrupted and broken. He would frequently cry out—"O that I had ſerved my Maker as faithfuly as I have my own luſt and appetites! that I had kept his ſabbath as good people do! how much better ſhould I have been at this time?" His conſcience was awake to reflection, and filled him with moſt dreadful horror. Every thing he ſaw reminded him either of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of duty or commiſſions of ſin—"Your kindneſs, ſaid he to Mr. Worthy, is almoſt too much for me. It reminds me of my
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:025609_0127_0FCE10F0DEA48F08"/>
unkindneſs to you, of the hard things I have ſaid, and the ill things I have done to you. I now ſee my folly, and am diſtreſſed more than I can expreſs about all my ſins." Mr. Worthy aſſured him that he need not give himſelf any trouble or uneaſineſs on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for that he had not laid up any thing againſt him, but wiſhed it was in his power to render him more ſervice. Mr. Worthy happened to be preſent when the agonies of death came on, and continued with him in that dreadful condition until death cloſed the horrid ſcene. He was greatly affected by the unhappy end of a man who had lived in ſo looſe and irregular a manner. When he conſidered the account which all rational creatures muſt give of the improvement of their time, and talents, he could ſcarcely help trembling for thoſe who waſte their time, precious time, and abuſe their rational powers, at taverns, and in the company of looſe and profane people. Mrs. Slack doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thought of theſe practices, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by what means her huſband was brought to his end. She therefore gave way to the violence of her paſſions, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt beſide herſelf with grief. Mr. Worthy endeavored to comfort her and to reconcile her to what had taken place, as it was the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025609_0128_0FCE10F262EEFE40"/>
will of God. She ſeemed at length to be more compoſed; but her tranquillity was not of long continuance. Trouble of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind came upon her. The eſtate was ſeized by the creditors, and ſhe was left in a poor and deſtitute condition. This is what every one may expect will be the caſe with their families, who follow gaming and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the neglect of their buſineſs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Farmer Worthy has a rational ſcheme for the education of his children—Maxims of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</head>
               <p>THERE are few who conſider conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, or trace effects up to their cauſes, ſo as to gain ſuitable inſtruction and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from them. Mr. Slack could ſee the conſequences of conduct like his in other people, but did not conſider them in his own caſe. If he had looked forward, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what muſt be the effects of his looſe, vague manner of living, he would have ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the thought of being the occaſion of ruin and diſtreſs to his family. He was not deſtitute of regard to his wife, nor of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for his children; and yet he purſued practices directly tending to their ruin, and which, in their conſequences, not only reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the utmoſt diſtreſs, but diſqual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified his children for life. In order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare children to live in the world, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to train them up in the knowledge of buſineſs, and in the habits of induſtry;
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:025609_0130_0FCE10F54B301320"/>
but if examples of a contrary nature are ſet before them, all inſtruction is vain and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Childhood and youth may be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a term of apprenticeſhip in which they are to be exerciſed in thoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby they are to live. They are not only to be made acquainted with buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as a practical ſcience, but to be taught ſelf government, and to be trained to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all thoſe amiable qualities whereby they will become good and agreeable, uſeful and happy.</p>
               <p>Farmer Worthy appeared to have a juſt ſenſe of theſe things upon his mind, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to practice accordingly. His views were not confined merely to the tillage of the land, but he devoted his mind to more rational objects, the care of his family, and his own immortal intereſt. Indeed, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the cultivation of the earth as a profeſſional calling, which he deemed an honorable occupation, becauſe neceſſary to man; and as it was the employment of Adam in innocence. He felt his dependence upon the Providence of God for every thing he enjoyed, and never failed to ſeek his bleſſing upon all his endeavors. But the education of his children was a matter that lay with great wait upon his mind. When he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025609_0131_0FCE10F7F2ED71F0"/>
around and ſaw how little attention many farmers paid to the minds of their children, he was ſhocked at the idea of having his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren grow up with minds ſo uncultivated. He would compare them to the foreſt that remains in its rude ſtate without cultivation. He thought it the indiſpenſible duty of every parent to cultivate the minds of his children in knowledge and in the principles of virtue. This duty he endeavored to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in an uniform manner. In order to do it moſt effectually, he ſtudied very attentively the different tempers and diſpoſitions of his children, and endeavored to govern them accordingly. This difference of diſpoſition appears at an early period, and any extremes ought to be corrected whenever an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity occurs. In a domeſtic ſtate, opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are frequently occurring. It is but to watch thoſe with care, and the work is done. Mr. Worthy ſeems to have had a rational ſcheme of managing his children, which he had digeſted well in his own mind; and which may be reduced to the following max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, or leading principles of education.</p>
               <p>Firſt impreſſions on the ſenſes produce laſting effects on the mind. They ſhould therefore be ſuch as will be favorable to virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:025609_0132_0FCE10F9769334E8"/>
Children, when very young, are taught by ſigns. Theſe ſhould be ſuch as to convey the beſt impreſſions—Look grieved, not angry, at their bad actions—joyful at their good ones, and compaſſionate at their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or pains.</p>
               <p>To imitate others is a natural propenſity in childhood—teach them to avoid danger, by avoiding it yourſelves—remove fear where there is no danger, by coolneſs and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs—accuſtom them from infancy to go in the dark, and they will never be affraid of it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe are their worſt enemies, who talk to children of ghoſts, and apparitions, &amp;c.—Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no ſuch perſon to tarry in your houſe.</p>
               <p>Stubbornneſs is an attempt to uſurp their authority. Let it be ſubdued by a ſteady tone of voice and manner of treatment. If the child will not eat what is offered, let it have nothing, hunger will bring it to. If it refuſes to do as bidden, deprive it of a favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite thing.</p>
               <p>To hear frequent complaints from chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, tends to beget jealouſies and ill will among them.—If then you would preſerve harmony between them, ſuffer them not to complain one of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="unknown:025609_0133_0FCE10FB20078A08"/>
Indulge not your children to exceſs—this would be giving them the authority over you, that you ſhould preſerve over them.</p>
               <p>Cruelty to inſects and animals generates cruelty to men—correct this diſpoſition with care—ſay with concern, "poor thing, it is capable of feeling pain as well as you, how would you like to be tortured ſo?"</p>
               <p>In the life they are juſt beginning they will be expoſed to many accidental evils—early enure them to bear theſe with firmneſs. "A young Spartan who had been trained to this, ſuffered a fox which he had ſtolen, to eat into his bowels rather than diſcloſe the theft."</p>
               <p>Induſtry and virtue are as nearly allied as induſtry and riches. Let the plays of children be connected with induſtry—give ſons a ſpot to till for their own amuſement and profit—to daughters, a little bed in the garden, or a lamb to bring up for themſelves; and by various other ways unite induſtry and economy with amuſement.</p>
               <p>Induſtry preſerves good humor.—Let childhood be occupied with ſome employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—nothing has a better effect on the diſpoſition, or better fits them for uſefulneſs and enjoyment in life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:025609_0134_0FCE10FC30795CE0"/>
Idleneſs begets ill nature and peeviſhneſs. It is the parent of many vices—cure chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this diſpoſition by active diverſions, and by making induſtry neceſſary to their ſubſiſtence. "He that will not work, let him not eat."</p>
               <p>Benevolence is the baſis of many good and amiable qualities—Let this be cheriſhed by example, and by every method of encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charity in children. The practice of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good cannot fail of improving a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>To be kind and beneficent, is to imitate the greateſt of all beings.—Convince your children that they cannot be more honorably employed than in relieving the indigent, not only with money, but by many kind offices.</p>
               <p>The happineſs of our preſent ſtate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much on the treatment we receive from others, and as we give we may expect to receive—fail not then to teach your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren civility to all, poor as well as rich.</p>
               <p>"Knowledge, ſaid a great man, is as grateful to the underſtanding, as light to the eyes."—Diſcourage not the curioſity of your children, but encourage their inquiries after knowledge.</p>
               <p>The appetites and deſires of children gather ſtrength by indulgence. They will
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:025609_0135_0FCE10FF1751E4F8"/>
ſoon become tyrants if too often gratified; but will make uſeful ſubjects under due reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation—reſtrain them by authority when quite young, and as reaſon dawns explain to them the folly of unreſtrained indulgence.</p>
               <p>Habits of integrity will make children truſt worthy.—Would you have your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren faithful to a truſt, early commit things to them in confidence, and require a faithful account.</p>
               <p>A frank diſpoſition is as beautiful in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter as it is uſeful in ſociety—gain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of children by gentle treatment, and they will not think of diſſembling.</p>
               <p>Children feel unhappy when they have committed a fault, until they confeſs it. Let a confeſſion procure pardon, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to relieve their minds; this will leſſen the number of their faults, and increaſe their confidence in their parents.</p>
               <p>Children are apt to think that happineſs conſiſts in a fine houſe or in riches.—To cure this error point out inſtances to the contrary, and ſhow them that the heart is the ſeat of happineſs, and that no one can be unhappy who is contented with his lot.</p>
               <p>Selfiſhneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">By ſelfiſhneſs is intended a perſon's regard to himſelf without any regard to others. It is oppoſed to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of benevolence.</note> is a low mean vice, to which many children are prone, and which grows
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:025609_0136_0FCE110094649C90"/>
for want of care.—If your child diſcovers this diſpoſition, oblige it to give away what it is fondeſt of; and when it can underſtand, repreſent man as a ſocial creature, liable to common wants and having in ſome reſpects a community of intereſts—ſpeak of ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as a contracted ſpirit altogether unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a rational being.</p>
               <p>Of all the paſſions, anger is the moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevious, and moſt difficult of reſtraint—Let children be early taught, and by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple too, to moderate this paſſion, to impoſe ſilence on themſelves till they can reflect, to conſider that what is ſaid in a paſſion is never prudent, ſeldom juſt.</p>
               <p>Juſtice in dealing is a duty of ſuch uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obligation, that it cannot be too early impreſt on the mind. <hi>Yours and mine</hi> is early heard among children; ſhow them how mutual juſtice ariſes out of theſe claims, and habituate them to the practice of that excellent rule—"whatſoever ye would that others ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo unto them."</p>
               <p>Morals inſpired by religion, is like a body animated by a ſoul—early impreſs the mind with ſentiments of piety.</p>
               <p>God is the firſt object of all religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard—juſt ſentiments of him are requiſite
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:025609_0137_0FCE110261688168"/>
to render religion a reaſonable ſervice. Children ſhould have their minds ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly impreſſed with ideas of his goodneſs to them—that he is their friend and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father—that they ſhould pray to, and praiſe him, and that they ſhould do his will by doing all the good they can. Tell them that he is every where preſent, and that nothing can be hid from him. Let him always be deſcribed as the moſt benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of all beings, and that whatſoever he does, it is all for the good of his creatures—that he is a friend to the good, an enemy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the wicked.</p>
               <p>Love to God and love to man are the great principles which comprehend all the duties we owe our maker and our fellow creatures—inſpire their minds with thoſe principles, and they will not be bigots to any modes of religion; their religion will conſiſt in the joint exerciſe of charity with piety, and of morality with devotion. This will be an honorable evidence that they are the true diſciples of Chriſt. Teach them to obſerve outward ordinances in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the will of God, and that he who does that ſincerely will be accepted.</p>
               <p>Let children grow up in the habit of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and of being religious, becauſe
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:025609_0138_0FCE11051024E770"/>
God commands it; and they will always have a reaſon at hand for avoiding ſin and doing their duty.</p>
               <p>The ſame reaſon (it is the will of God) will teach them patience in adverſity, and ſubmiſſion to the evils of life, and help them to derive conſolation from the conſciouſneſs of ſuch pious ſentiments.</p>
               <p>As a ſupport to their minds in their preſent condition, lead their thoughts to a ſtate of immortality—teach them that as they live but to die, ſo they die but to live.</p>
               <p>This doctrine can only be aſcertained by revelation. To this they ſhould be led as ſoon as reaſon can comprehend ſomething of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>"Chriſtianity, ſaid a writer of great emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, claims our attention on ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts—it is the religion of our fathers—it has a ſhow of evidence—if it be true, it is a truth of high concern.</p>
               <p>"Many of the objections to chriſtianity are owing to miſrepreſentation of it. Let the teſtament be conſulted.

Does it make the way to commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with him more plain and pleaſant?</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Anecdote of little Joſeph—Story of Robert and Hugh Hamilton—the good character and proſperity of the former, and the badneſs and misfortunes of the other.</head>
               <p>AFTER ſo much dry matter, I think a ſtory founded on fact, which Mr. Worthy promiſed little Joſeph upon a certain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will be acceptable to the young reader. If properly regarded, it will be ſerviceable to him alſo. The occaſion of this promiſe was this. Mr. Worthy's little ſon Joſeph, as he was at play with ſome little boys, heard one of them, who was a new comer into the place, ſpeak bad words; and when his brother told him that he would tell his maſter if he did not leave off ſpeaking ſuch wicked words, this bad boy replied, that "he did not care for his maſter. He would play truant when he had a mind to." This ſpeech ſo ſhocked the mind of little Joſeph, that he ran directly home and told his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he would not play with Billy Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler any more, becauſe he ſpoke bad words,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:025609_0142_0FCE110E80740720"/>
and was a very wicked boy. Mrs. Worthy was ſo pleaſed with this piece of conduct in her little ſon that ſhe related every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it to Mr. Worthy as ſoon as he came home. He called Joſeph a good boy for doing as he had done, and as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for his good conduct told him, that he would relate to him a ſtory of two boys, which would ſhow him the happy effects of behaving well, and the fatal conſcequences of being wicked when young. But as the ſtory was ſomething lengthy and it was now time for Joſeph to go to bed, Mr. Worthy told him that he would reſerve it till the next evening. This delay was a great trial to Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's patience, for his curioſity was greatly raiſed. But being accuſtomed to obedience, he went directly to bed without any marks of impatience. The next evening Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who was always careful to fulfil his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to his children, took care to be at home in ſuch ſeaſon as to diſcharge his engagement to Joſeph before his bed time. No ſooner was Mr. Worthy ſeated in the houſe than Joſeph reminded his daddy of his promiſe, and he immediately related as follows.</p>
               <p>In the town where Mr. Belmont lives, there lived, not many years ago, a gentleman by the name of Hamilton. This gentleman came
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:025609_0143_0FCE110FA2DABEA8"/>
over from Scotland and got a great eſtate by trading in that town. He had ſeveral child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, but loſt them all except two ſons. Their names were Robert and Hugh. Their parents were ſo affraid that ſomething would happen to deprive them of theſe, that they had ſcarcely any comfort, and watched over them with great care. They were ſo fond of them alſo, that they indulged them in every thing that they wiſhed for. They never could ſee any fine thing but they wanted it; and then it muſt be bought for them. "O daddy, cried Joſeph, I wiſh I could have all I want, I would ſoon have ſuch a fine gold laced hat as Mrs. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont ſaid her little George has got, and ſuch a little ſword too as ſhe ſaid he had." "Stay Joſe, ſaid Mr. Worthy, hear how they came out before you wiſh for ſuch fooliſh things." Robert, tho naturally a good tempered boy, was much injured by being ſo much indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He would frequently be out of humor, but was very fond of his book, and had a great deſire to learn. It was by means of this that his parents were able to keep him ſteady at ſchool. But Hugh, who was nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally croſs, was very troubleſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly. He hated his books and did not care whether he learnt to read or not. He
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:025609_0144_0FCE11110B48B3D0"/>
often played truant. His parents did not correct him for it; nor would they ſuffer his maſter to do it. He grew worſe and worſe, till he would ſpeak all manner of bad words, and fight with the boys, and made every body hate or deſpiſe him. At laſt his maſter became quite tired of being troubled with ſuch an illnatured baſe boy, and deſired his father to ſend him ſomewhere elſe, for he could do nothing with him. This was a dreadful trouble to his parents. But they were obliged to ſend him to a ſchool in the country, where they hoped he would do better. They began now to ſee their error in indulging him too much, and endeavored to be more ſtrict with him. He behaved bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a little while, but they indulged him in coming home too often. In ſhort, he was ſo bad a boy that no body loved him where he now was. He was ſo fretful and ill natured that he made more enemies than friends. When Mr. Hamilton found he did not learn, he blamed the maſter, and threatened to remove his ſon to another place. This was very good news to the maſter, and to all the ſcholars, for he was very troubleſome to both, and would not attend to his book; and always choſe to play with the worſt boys that he could find,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:025609_0145_0FCE111351D3DF90"/>
becauſe their wickedneſs afforded him ſome countenance.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Robert was very ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and learnt ſo well that he got before moſt of the boys of his own age. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved ſo mannerly and pleaſant to every body, that every one who knew him loved him, and ſpoke well of him. This was a great comfort to his parents; but the conduct of Hugh gave them great pain. When they had arrived at ſuch an age as to be put to buſineſs, Robert was put to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in the ſame town, where he continued to recommend himſelf by his good conduct. But what to do with Hugh they knew not. At laſt they received a letter from an uncle of his in Scotland, who was of the ſame name. This gentleman informed Mr. Hamilton that he had juſt buried his only ſon; and underſtanding that he had one of the ſame name, he had written for him to come over and live with him. This appeared to be a fine opening both to new motives to behave well, and to be made an heir to a great eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. Hugh was accordingly ſent to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; but he was ſoon ſurpriſed and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to find what a dunce he was. He was ſtill more vexed when he diſcovered him to be an ill natured, miſchievous and wicked

boy. Indeed, it was ſome time before his uncle diſcovered how baſe and vicious a lad he was, for he continued a good while to deceive him; but at laſt threw off all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. He kept the worſt company he could find, was frequently out all night, drinking and gaming, and at all the vileſt houſes that there was. Thus did Hugh conduct tho' his uncle offered to do every thing for him if he would behave well, that he would not only make him a man a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs but give him a great part of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. But he had grown ſo hardened and abandoned that he cared not for any thing that could be ſaid. Mr. Hamilton, hearing of the ill conduct of his ſon, wrote to him repeatedly to endeavor to reclaim him, and make him behave well.—"I am ſure, ſaid Charles, he muſt be a very wicked boy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, daddy, if neither his uncle, money, nor his father's commands, could make him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter." Yes, my ſon, continued Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, but it is no more ſtrange than true, noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could reclaim him, he had become ſo bad, and was ſo much under the influence of his baſe companions. This conduct of a ſon, ſo tenderly beloved, broke his mother's heart; and his father was ſo affected by her death and his conduct, both together, that
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:025609_0147_0FCE111927492CB8"/>
his health began to decline, and before Hugh was twenty one years old his father died, leaving the moſt of his eſtate to Robert. This train of events ſeemed to have a good effect on Hugh for a little while, which gave his uncle ſo much hope of his ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormation that he gave him five hundred pounds to do buſineſs with; but his bad companions ſoon made him ſpend it all. He came over to America not long after this, for his uncle would have no more to do with him.</p>
               <p>Robert had all this time been improving his mind, and had began to encreaſe his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate conſiderably. He was eſteemed more and more by thoſe who knew him, both for his good nature and his honeſty. Indeed he was good and kind to every body, and helped poor folks all he could. It was in this proſperous ſtate of Robert's affairs, that Hugh arrived in America. His pride was too great to ſuffer him to go directly to his brother for aſſiſtance. He therefore went to his old practice of gaming; but with ſuch poor ſucceſs that he ſoon loſt the few ſhillings that he had. His brother knew nothing of his return yet.—"O no, I dare ſay he did not know it, daddy, ſaid, the little Mary, who had been all this time liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:025609_0148_0FCE111AB38525E0"/>
with great attention, for if he had known how poor he was he would have given him ſomething tho' he was wicked."—Yes, my dear, ſaid Mr. Worthy, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would, for people muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to live upon if they are bad, that they may have opportunity to grow better."—This poor unhappy creature was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the laſt farthing, and knew not which way to turn to get any thing to eat. In this dreadful condition he thought he would go and make himſelf known to his brother, who he knew had plenty of every thing. But he determined to try his luck once more, at one of thoſe low houſes where wicked people reſort to game and drink and carouſe all night. He had not been here long before he had a dreadful quarrel with one of his wicked companions, his ſpirits being raiſed by liquor. They ſoon went from words to blows, but his antagoniſt was too mighty for him and gave him ſuch a bruiſing that he ran into the ſtreet, and cried out murder! murder! Robert, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be paſſing in that part of the town, juſt at this time, hearing this outcry, went that way, and ſeeing ſeveral people ruſh out of the houſe, he ſeized the firſt perſon he could catch, and draged him to a light.
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:025609_0149_0FCE111CA9E893A0"/>
He was ſo dirty and bloody that Robert did not know who he was, nor did he once think that his brother was in this country. But as ſoon as they came to the light, Hugh knew him, by a mark acroſs his chin by the kick of a horſe when he was a child, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly cried out, Oh my brother, my broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er!—Robert was ſurpriſed to hear the voice of his brother Hugh, which he perfectly recollected, tho he had not ſeen him for many years. He took him immediately to his houſe, and ſent for a ſurgeon to dreſs his wounds. He ſoon got well of thoſe by the great care and tenderneſs of his brother. His kindneſs had a good effect on Hugh for a while, and he was in hope that it might reform him.—"Did not he grow good, daddy, ſaid the little Joſeph, after his brother was ſo good to him?"—"You will hear preſently my ſon, replied Mr. Worthy, what effect it had upon him; but I can aſſure you Joſe, that if it is hard making bad boys become good, it is ſtill harder making bad men become better, becauſe they have been bad ſo long, that they can hardly ever be turned away from their bad courſes, and therefore it is very dangerous being bad boys."</p>

                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:025609_0150_0FCE111DD4ACFBE8"/>
"Mr. Robert Hamilton was doing a great deal of buſineſs at this time, and wanted an aſſiſtant. He told his brother Hugh that he he ſhould be welcome to continue in his houſe; and that he would give him good wages if he would forſake his wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and be ſteady to buſineſs. He ſeemed pleaſed with the offer, and promiſed fair. His brother furniſhed him with good clothes, and ſome money. But it was not long before he returned to his old ways, and became worſe than ever. His brother often talked to him about his conduct, adviſed him to have more regard to his reputation, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the conſequences of his conduct both in this world and in that which is to come. He would not regard the good advice of his brother nor any of his friends, but became tired of their dry preaching, as he called it, and determined to return to Scotland again, in hopes that his uncle, who was now dead, had left him ſome part of his eſtate. He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on board a ſhip as a private hand. They had a bad ſtorm on the paſſage, when they thought that every ſoul would have perſhed. Hugh was in dreadful diſtreſs, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf bitterly for his conduct, which had driven him away from a place where he might have been very happy. The ſtorm
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:025609_0151_0FCE111F4D89AED8"/>
abated, and the ſea was again calm; but the ſtorm in his mind continued, and he was terribly agitated to think what a life he had lived. His trouble was renewed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſeveral days afterwards, for when they had gotten near to the place where they were going, a worſe ſtorm than the other aroſe, and it being very dark the ſhip ſtruck the rocks, and poor Hugh Hamilton was daſhed to pieces among them." Joſeph's little heart was ready to burſt at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the ſtory; and he ſaid he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to play with Billy Hiller any more.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. Mr. Worthy purchaſes books for his children—cultivates tenderneſs and ſenſibility of heart—an affecting ſtory of Jimmy the Rover.</head>
               <p>FARMER Worthy uſed to ſay in the circle of his neighbors, "we farmers know that the ground muſt be tilled, and good ſeed muſt be ſown, if we expect to reap a crop. The ſame thing is true, ſaid he, of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. If we expect them to bear good fruit when they are grown up, we muſt give them good inſtruction, and govern them well now, while the ſeeds of future conduct are ſowing in their hearts." The obſervation was very juſt and well applied. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly took care to uſe various methods of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and impreſſing the minds of his children with virtuous principles. The method which he found moſt pleaſing, as well as uſeful, was to furniſh them with books containing ſtories of a moral tendency. Theſe, he obſerved, often left deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on the mind, becauſe they intereſt
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:025609_0153_0FCE11247645B8F8"/>
the feelings of the heart, while the narrative inclines them to read. He therefore never begrudged the money he laid out for books, but purchaſed many. From theſe he could collect a variety of uſeful and entertaining ſtories, ſuited to the different ages of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Theſe he would ſometimes read to them, ſometimes cauſe them to read; and at other times would repeat ſuch ſtories as had come to his knowledge, which had a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to take hold of the heart. To theſe narratives his children would liſten with great attention. Sometimes the tear of ſenſibility would ſteal down their little cheeks at the tale of woe. At other times their hearts would dilate with joy, and the eye ſparkle with pleaſure on a change of the ſcene. By taking hold of their fine feelings in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the heart was preparing for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that great chriſtian precept—"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep them that do weep."</p>
               <p>One evening, as ſeveral of the children returned from a viſit to a neighbor's child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren at ſome diſtance, they found their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reclining on the ſettle which ſtood near the kitchen door, much fatigued with the labor of the day. They flocked around him, eager to relate what they had ſeen. That
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:025609_0154_0FCE1126F3B65B88"/>
which had excited their curioſity moſt of all, was the pranks, and ſtrange talk of one Peggy Cummin, an Iriſh girl, who lived at Mr. Spencer's where they had been. Peggy had been a girl of good character, but being viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited by a young man who wickedly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was very fond of her, and as ſoon as he could get into a way to live, would marry her, ſhe inadvertently gave way to his inſinuations, and then he left her in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation truly deplorable. This took ſuch deep hold on her mind that ſhe became delirious, and the town engaged Mr. Spencer to take care of Peggy and her child. The children ſeemed greatly affected at the ſight of her, and could hardly tell how ſhe talked, and acted, and ſobbed, without ſhedding tears. When Mr. Worthy had heard them out, he ſaid that if he were not ſo very much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, he would relate to them the ſtory of Jimmy the Rover, who run crazy, and lived in the cave of Vanhine, in the back parts of Pennſylvania. He told them, however, that they muſt be patient with him till the next evening, and then he would gratify them with his affecting ſtory.</p>
               <p>The next evening, being reminded of his promiſe, he related the following account of James Mackormick, who came to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:025609_0155_0FCE1128C9858FA0"/>
to ſeek his fortune. "He was induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and proſpered ſo well that he married a very worthy deſerving girl, who had lived ſometime with Mrs. Vanhime, a very charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gentlewoman, who lived in a little town on the banks of the Delaware. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards removed to another part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where he hoped to do better for himſelf, than where he then was. He ſucceeded quite well for ſome time, but meeting with ſeveral misfortunes, and his family faſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, he got involved, and the heirs of his creditor, who happened to die about this time, thruſt him into a loathſome jail. This happened at a time when his wife was ill, and in conſequence of it became very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſick. She went beſide herſelf, and died not long after. To her death followed the death of his two youngeſt children, one of them but an infant. Theſe misfortunes drove him into a ſtate of diſtraction, and they releaſed him from confinement. He ſaid, "I have no home—the earth is my home. I will go up and down in it, till I find a cave where human foot will not come." He ſtiled himſelf Jimmy the Rover. He wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered about from place to place, with his two remaining children, whom he called Venona and Penelope.—At length, in his
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:025609_0156_0FCE112B373C6180"/>
wanderings, he diſcovered a deep cave under ſome rocks. This was not a very great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the place where he had married his lovely Sylvia, as he always called his wife, when he ſpoke of her. Here he determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take up his abode. He called it the cave of Vanhime, after the name of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman with whom his wife had lived. The paſs into this cave was narrow. It was only large enough to contain him and his two children, and his faithful dog, who had long been the companion of his poverty. He would frequently wander all day about in the woods, while the children went to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle town not far off, to beg ſome proviſion for their poor old daddy and themſelves. In the night they would lodge by their hapleſs father." "What, ſtay there all night daddy, ſaid Henry?" "Yes, I believe they did, ſaid the little Joſeph. I am ſure I would not leave my daddy alone if he was poor and ſick." "nor I neither, ſaid Dorcas," "nor I, nor I, ſaid they all."—Venona and Penelope were dutiful children, continued Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and could not be perſuaded to leave him. One day they went to the place where the gentlewoman lived, that I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, not knowing any thing of her themſelves, but the dog knew her, though
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:025609_0157_0FCE112C0EC99D30"/>
he had not been that way for many years. She inquired their names, and found their place of retirement. This good lady fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with many neceſſaries, and aſked them if they would come and live with her. They thanked her, but ſaid their daddy would be left alone if they did, and they could not leave him.—"Good children, ſaid the good lady, you muſt take good care of your daddy." She ſent for him to come to her houſe. He came, but was not to be perſuaded out of his way of life. The ſmall pox came about. His two children caught it. They were carried to an hoſpital—they died—he ſaw them gaſping for breath—yes, he ſaw them expire—he wrung his hands—he could not ſpeak—he could not ſhed a tear, his heart was too full.</p>
               <p>After his children were buried, he viſited their graves daily. Here he poured out tears and lamentations to no purpoſe. Curſo, his dog, always accompanied him in theſe gloomy viſits. "Curſo, ſaid Jimmy, will never leave me." His ſpirits began to fail him. He grew melancholy, and ſeldom went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the little town on the margin of the river. He would look at the river and ſay, "ſo runs life as the water flows down." He called on Mrs. Vanhime. She would
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:025609_0158_0FCE112D9E534670"/>
have relieved him, but he would give to his dog whatever ſhe gave him for his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. Curſo was unfortunately killed by an ill natured man who did not care whom he injured, nor how much he tortured ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. This was the laſt ſtroke that could befal poor Jimmy the Rover. He betook himſelf to his cabin. Mrs. Vanhime kindly viſited him. She wept with him as he tried to relate his troubles—he grew more rational and calm. She offered him ſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—he would have taken it, but nature was too much exhauſted. He ſaid to her, with a ſerene countenance, "Madam, I thank you for your goodneſs—you have been kind to me—you was ſo to my dear Sylvia—ſhe is gone, I am going—God is juſt—we ſhall both be happy." Having ſpoke this, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired without a groan.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Worthy had finiſhed this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative he looked round and ſaw all his little audience in tears; and pleaſantly ſaid to them, that though they might weep at the troubles and diſtreſſes of poor Jimmy; yet they had reaſon to rejoice in the happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change he made, by dying in ſo calm a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This compoſed them in a good meaſure; and a little affair took place ſoon after, which gave birth to new inſtructions,

               <head>CHAP XIX. A little rupture takes place in the family—Mrs. Worthy interferes and bears teſtimony againſt angry paſſions—their dangerous tendency illuſtrated in the ſtory of Cate Smithers.</head>
               <p>AFFECTING as the ſtory of Jim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the Rover was, a little affair took place not long after, which occaſioned a rupture between the two youngeſt ſiſters. This conteſt was about a trifle, indeed; but they diſcovered ſo much anger that Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy interpoſed, and by her prudent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſoon ſettled the diſpute. They look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much aſhamed, when they come to think what they had been doing, and would gladly have gone out of ſight of the family. But Mrs. Worthy ſaid to them, in an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate manner, I perceive you are both aſhamed of your folly, and I am glad to ſee it. I pity you becauſe you puniſh your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Had you, my dear, addreſſing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the elder of the two contending ſiſters, given way to your little ſiſter's humor, there
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:025609_0161_0FCE113569B55E40"/>
would have been propriety in your conduct. You would have ſhown that being older, you were wiſer alſo. Then turning to the younger ſhe ſaid, My father uſed to ſay—"He that gives a blow does not begin an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray, but he that returns it."—If you had given up what you thought was your's, when your ſiſter contended for it, you would have ſhown that you had a mind ſuperior to her, though you are younger. I hope, continued Mrs. Worthy, that neither of you will be guilty of the ſame folly any more; and added, that the fate of Cate Smithers was enough to convince any body of the folly and danger of indulging angry paſſions. She lived in a town where my father uſed to be called on buſineſs ſometimes; and I will take an opportunity to tell it to you as he uſed to do to us."</p>
               <p>Mr. Worthy was all this time ſilent, but was much pleaſed with what his wife ſaid on this occaſion, and alſo with the manner in which ſhe treated the ſubject. But as Mrs. Worthy had undertaken to root out this vicious paſſion, he did not interfere. She accordingly took a favorable opportunity to relate to her children what her father had formerly told to his family of one Cate Smithers, a remarkable ill natured girl, who
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:025609_0162_0FCE113754D943D8"/>
made herſelf and every body about her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, by means of her ill humor and angry paſſions. As her children were all around her one evening, when the moon ſhone bright and the air was remarkably ſerene, ſupper being juſt cleared away, ſhe related the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing circumſtances concerning her.</p>
               <p>Cate, ſaid Mrs. Worthy, was not only an only daughter, but an only child. Her fond mother would not ſuffer her to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted in any thing. Cate was not very good humored naturally, but her temper and diſpoſition were made ten times worſe by indulgence. Being always uſed to have every thing give way to her humor, ſhe could not bear any inconvenience or contradiction. She would fly into a moſt violent paſſion if ſhe could not have every thing ſhe wanted. When ſhe was quite a child, if ſhe fell down, her mother would beat the floor. This taught her to revenge, and to ſtrike and kick every thing that ſtood in the way. She could not look pretty becauſe her ſpirits were ſo often ſtirred up by every trifle, that ſhe looked ſour and croſs. So that Cate Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who might have been very handſome, was very homely, by reaſon of her being ſo often angry; and no body liked her. She was forever fretting and complaining. Every
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:025609_0163_0FCE1138DB076348"/>
thing appeared wrong to her becauſe ſhe was not right herſelf. Her anger would take fire on every trivial occaſion, and ſhe kept the houſe moſt of the time in a broil. This was a great trouble to her mother; but her paſſions had now ſo got the upper hand, that there was no ſtopping them. At length her doating mother began to find her health decline. The weight of evils brought upon her by the ill humor of Cate, made her grow worſe and worſe.—"O mamma, ſaid Margrett, what a wicked girl muſt ſhe be to afflict her poor mother ſo?" "Girls are always naughty, ſaid Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, when they afflict their mothers by any bad conduct, eſpecially by indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in anger." Margrett felt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and ſaid no more. "Cate's mother, continued Mrs. Worthy, fell under the weight of thoſe evils. She died, lamenting that her poor unhappy daughter had not died at the breaſt.</p>
               <p>What would not Cate have given now that ſhe could undo the evil ſhe had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned? She was left without a friend in the world. She was hated by all who lived in the houſe; but did not long ſurvive her mother to ſuffer the wretchedneſs of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this world. It was very difficult
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:025609_0164_0FCE113CA2C07FE8"/>
with all her money, of which ſhe had enough, to prevail with any nurſe to take care of her in her laſt ſickneſs, becauſe ſhe was ſo often angry with them. No body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her death. Not a tear was ſhed at her grave; and the only benefit her memory can be to the world is to warn every body againſt indulging angry paſſions."</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX. Falſhood detected and reproved—inſtances of the diſadvantages of it in Henry Bramble and Jane Barnwell.</head>
               <p>IT was by theſe gentle and inſtructive meaſures, that Mrs. Worthy ſettled the little diſputes which at any time aroſe in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; ſo that there was no noiſe or tumult, as is the caſe in many families when a little jarring takes place between the children, which will be the caſe in all families. Mr. Worthy guarded the morals of his children with equal care, and when he diſcovered a diſpoſition in any of them to violate the truth, or to be unfaithful, he endeavored to make them aſhamed of it. He had been abroad on a certain occaſion for a few days, and on his return home he found ſome miſchief had been done. When he came to inquire into it, he diſcovered a diſpoſition in one of his ſons, whom he ſuppoſed was in fault, to evade the truth; and though he did not tell a poſitive falſhood, yet he attempted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. This was very diſpleaſing to Mr.
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:025609_0166_0FCE113FDBB458A0"/>
Worthy, who always practiſed and enjoined the ſtricteſt integrity. He ceaſed therefore to inquire any further into the matter for the preſent; but took an early opportunity to ſpeak to his children on the importance of ſpeaking the truth. He dwelt on the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all attempts to deceive. "An at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make another believe what was not true, he ſaid, conſtituted the crime of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and was very offenſive to him who knows every thing that paſſes in the human heart." He ſpoke with ſuch warmth, and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, on the ſubject of deceiving, by which he ſaid he meant falſhood, that it was not long before the guilty boy diſcovered his guilt by bluſhing, and an evident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of mind. When Mr. Worthy ſpoke ſo pointedly of the baſeneſs of lying, and of its dangerous tendency both in this world and in that which is to come; he could not help diſcovering an uneaſineſs that marked him to be the guilty one. "I am glad," ſaid Mr. Worthy, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him—"I am glad to perceive this confuſion which a conſciouſneſs of your guilt has thrown you into."—The lad burſt into tears, and confeſſed the fact.—Mr. Worthy ceaſed to ſay any thing more directly to him. But went on to obſerve to his children, that
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:025609_0167_0FCE1141442D36C0"/>
"to ſpeak the truth, always was noble and honorable; that truth was like good coin, it would paſs every where; and that falſehood was like counterfeit money that would ſoon be detected, and would not paſs any where."</p>
               <p>This truth, he ſaid, might be eſtabliſhed by many inſtances; but one he particularly alluded to was, the unfortunate Henry Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who ſuffered ſo much from the habit of telling falſehoods that he was obliged to leave it off for his own ſafety. One day as he paſſed his father's field, he ſaw a number of cattle breaking into it. He ran to call ſome boys, who were going to the river to ſwim, to aſſiſt him in driving them out; but the boys would not go, ſaying "we don't believe a word of it; he is only going to make fools of us." He continued to ſay that it was true, and perſiſted in it with ſo much earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtneſs that at laſt he prevailed on them to go with him, but he had been ſo long in gaining credit with them, that the cattle had nearly deſtroyed the corn. He ſuffered great diſadvantage on ſeveral accounts; for he became ſo notoriouſly bad at length, that his maſter could not believe one word he ſaid, and forbid the boys of the ſchool to play with him. This made him aſhamed of himſelf, and ſeemed to effect ſome reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:025609_0168_0FCE114394677708"/>
but that which brought him to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the danger of ſuch practices was the conduct of John Briggs, a ſtout boy, who was offended at Henry for ſome falſehoods he had told about him. John took the opportunity to waylay Henry as he was going to ſchool, and gave him a ſound flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Henry was no match for John, and therefore did not attempt to return the blows, but threatened to tell the maſter—"Tell him, tell him, ſays John, if you dare, and he will flog you for lying."—John took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this part of Henry's character to gratify his revenge upon him ſeveral times. Henry bore it with as much patience as he could, for ſome time. At laſt he made complaint to his father of the abuſes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from John Briggs. Henry's father went to John's parents to complain of the abuſes his ſon received. Without ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the truth of the caſe, they told him that "there was no believing one word that Henry ſaid." This was indeed a very painful reply, but it was all he could get; and John continued beating Henry till he had obtained full ſatisfaction for the injury he had received from him. After this Henry grew more cautious of ſpeaking falſehood; and continued to tell the truth till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:025609_0169_0FCE1145FADC09F8"/>
his character, and found by his own experience, that truth was not only more natural and eaſy, but alſo more pleaſing and delightful than falſehood." He alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded them of the ſtory of Jane Barnwel, who was always inventing falſe ſtories. If ſhe had broken any thing, ſhe would lay it to the cat or the dog, if it were any miſchief that they could do, and they were beaten for her faults. Sometimes ſhe would lay it to the ſervants, and they muſt ſuffer for her falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. This made them hate her, and ſhe was deſpiſed by all who knew her, for ſuch conduct.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. The generoſity of Charles toward Edward Fleming, who had injured him.—Mr. Worthy's conduct on this occaſion, a good model for imitation.</head>
               <p>NOTHING could be more pleaſing to Mr. Worthy or to his wife, than to ſee their children avoiding thoſe vices which tarniſh human nature, and acting on thoſe good principles which they had inſtilled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their minds. How highly then muſt they have been gratified at the generous conduct of their ſon Charles, toward Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Fleming, who was a very great rogue, and lived in the ſame town. He was called Rogue Ned, by all the boys, on account of his being full of roguiſh tricks. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a widow, and unable to manage him. It was a great grief to her that he did not incline to learn at ſchool, nor to go with her to public worſhip. This boy was about the age of Charles Worthy, who was a lad of a noble, generous mind, and ſcorned a little thing. Though Ned ſometimes treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:025609_0171_0FCE1149C0383A88"/>
him baſely, and ſtole his things, yet Charles never troubled his mother with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt him. One day as Charles was paſſing where Ned was throwing ſtones and playing the fool, he threw a ſtone at Charles, probably not with an intention to injure him, but to gratify his roguiſh humor. The ſtone however ſtruck him near the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and though the wound was not deep, yet it bled profuſely, and gave him ſome pain. Charles hurried home, and coming in all bloody, affrighted his mother exceedingly. But Charles endeavored to make light of it, and ſaid, "he did not think that Ned meant to hurt him; and he did not doubt but it would ſoon be well," and ſo it proved.</p>
               <p>It happened not long after this affair, that, as Charles was paſſing a piece of woods on his way to mill, he heard a ſudden outcry, and a rattling among the limbs of the trees. He was frighted at firſt, but hearing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body call, as if in diſtreſs, he jumped from his horſe and ran towards the place, where he found Ned in a dreadful ſituation. This arch rogue was ſent on an errand by his mother, but inſtead of going as he was directed, he went after bird's eggs. In this wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from his duty, he met with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, for having ventured too far out upon
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:025609_0172_0FCE114B252844A0"/>
a limb after a bird's neſt, the limb broke and down came the hapleſs boy much to his injury. Charles, like a humane, tender hearted lad, ſhowed great concern for his misfortune, and with much difficulty helped him to get upon his own horſe, and carried him home to his mother. Mrs. Fleming was ſo affected with the ſituation of her undutiful ſon, and with the generoſity of Charles, that ſhe well nigh fainted away. The afflicted mother could not help exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "This is really doing good for evil." On Charles's arrival home he related what had paſſed, and in the moſt compaſſionate ſtrain begged his father to ſend ſomething for the relief of the poor woman, and for Ned too. Mr. Worthy highly applauded this generous conduct of his ſon; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him that to do good for evil, was the beſt retaliation in the world; and that the conſciouſneſs of having done a benevolent action, would always be the beſt cordial for every painful ſenſation.</p>
               <p>Agreeably to Mr. Worthy's uſual practice, when he knew of any one in diſtreſs, he went to ſee what aſſiſtance Mrs. Fleming needed, and to viſit the wicked boy, in hopes of making ſome good impreſſions on his mind, by means of his bodily ſufferings. Mr. Worthy had
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:025609_0173_0FCE114D68E3A6C0"/>
tried before to reclaim him, but his attempts had hitherto been in vain. In hopes that he could now ſoften his heart, he carried him ſome comforting things, ſuch as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate required. His goodneſs was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with gratitude by Mrs. Fleming. She was loud in the praiſes of his ſon Charles, and ſaid ſhe would give the world if Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward poſſeſſed the ſame temper. Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy took the opportunity to ſay many things to him on the ſubject of being dutiful to his mother, and of behaving well to every body. After ſaying what he thought proper to Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he returned home. It was on this occaſion that his heart overflowed with grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude to heaven for the domeſtic bleſſings he enjoyed; for when he came in, he found Mrs. Worthy ſurrounded by her children, who were employed in working or reading. He offered up an ejaculation at the pleaſing ſight, and bleſt the God of the families of the earth, for his unſpeakable goodneſs in granting him ſo many lovely and dutiful children. Seating himſelf in the midſt of his domeſtic circle, he ſpoke to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the duty and pleaſure of humanity and charity. "What pleaſure, ſays he, does it afford, to relieve our fellow creatures in diſtreſs, to ſee their ſorrow turned into joy?
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:025609_0174_0FCE114E97B48310"/>
The duty, he obſerved, was founded in the common nature of man, and their common relation to the Creator, and the neceſſity of diſcharging it, he ſaid, aroſe from the liable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all are in to the ſame diſaſters." He particularly mentioned that "this was a duty that ſhould be exerciſed not only to friends and acquaintance, but to all without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. However diſagreeable others may be to us, or however unthankful, yet when troubles come upon them, we are bound to pity and relieve them."</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. Containing Mr. Worthy's obſervations on tenderneſs to animals—an inſtance of the fatal effects of cruelty—alſo, of the ſtrength of affection in ſome animals.</head>
               <p>THE tranſition from humanity, to tenderneſs to animals, is ſo eaſy and natural, that Mr. Worthy renewed the ſubject, after being interrupted a while, and obſerved that tenderneſs to animals was connected with generoſity and humanity. It is, ſaid he, an old ſaying, that—"a merciful man will be merciful to his beaſt." This is a duty that we can't get rid of, for the ſcriptures command us to be followers of God as his children. Since our heavenly father takes care of the young ravens, of all the animal creation, and provides them with the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for their ſubſiſtence, we ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his goodneſs by being kind and tender towards them. They and we, continued Mr. Worthy, are his creatures, both depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent on him for the continuance and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of life; and, if we have any claim of
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:025609_0176_0FCE1151C444F4E0"/>
ſuperiority to them, we ſhould always ſhow it by imitating their and our common Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in tender usage and kind treatment."</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations and many others of a like nature, which Mr. Worthy made, were very juſt, and ſhowed him to be a man who thought and reflected a great deal; they were founded in nature, and were agreeable to the ſcripture. Other animals only think of themſelves; but man is allowed to retrace the image that God firſt implanted in him. He feels the warmth of devotion, of which the animals appear to have no ſenſe. He feels a generous love unfelt by them. Every part of creation affords an exerciſe for vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and conſequently a ſource of pleaſure to him.—Inſects, birds, and animals, all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy what their beneficent Creator gives them. As they receive their exiſtence and ſupport from the ſame fountain from which we derive our's, it muſt be our duty to avoid hurting them, to thank him for what we receive, and to imitate him in doing good.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall we prove that we are ſincere, when we pray to him; but we only affront him when we pray to him, and do not ſtrive to imitate his perfections, which he every where diſplays for our imitation, that we
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:025609_0177_0FCE1154A9516480"/>
may grow better and happier. Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who had treaſured up many uſeful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations from his own knowledge, as well as many anecdotes from books, obſerved that "at Mr. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>'s they ſeem to take pleaſure in tormenting every thing that falls in their way. Thoſe muſt ſurely have a bad heart who can delight in ſuch things, in hurting and afflicting every creature that comes within their power. Such people can't be capable of much humanity. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, continued Mr. Worthy, I have either read or heard of a man who was puniſhed in his own way for indulging this baſe temper. He not only practiſed cruelty to animals to a high degree, but alſo on his own family. He ſeemed to delight in nothing ſo much as in tantalizing them, and ſeeing them miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He neglected the education of his children, and was an example of cruelty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The conſequence was, that when he became old and unable to help himſelf, they neglected him. He grew old and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but found no relief nor ſupport from them; nay, they had no pity for him. He went ſtaggering about under the weight of his infirmities, which were the effect of his vices, eſpecially his cruelty, till at length he fell
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:025609_0178_0FCE11560AB77438"/>
into a ditch, and expired in a moſt miſerable condition.</p>
               <p>"The ſtrength of affection that appears in ſome animals toward their young, Mr. Worthy further obſerved, ſhows the baſeneſs of cruelty toward them. This, ſaid he, is illuſtrated in a moſt ſtriking manner, in the following inſtance:—A dog which had all her litter taken away from her and drowned, (which, indeed, ſeems the eaſieſt way of diſpatching them when it is neceſſary) found out where they were thrown, and brought them one by one, and laid them at the feet of her cruel maſter—ſhe looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately at them for ſome time, in dumb anguiſh, then turning her eyes on the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyer—ſhe expired."</p>
               <p>The heart of a child, who is early bred to treat animals with tenderneſs, will be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manized at the period when, like wax, it takes every impreſſion. Such an heart will be prepared to be an inſtrument of much good to the world, when ripened by age. A child who is taught never wantonly to tread on an inſect, nor to diſregard the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive complaints of the ſpeechleſs beaſt, will not be able when grown up, to refuſe bread to the hungry, nor comfort to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Thus, while they are patronizing
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:025609_0179_0FCE11578AD27E18"/>
the animal world, they are rendering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more uſeful to their fellow creatures, and laying in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. In our moſt proſperous ſtate we are liable to ſudden changes—a diſtreſsful event throws a gloom over Mr. Worthy's houſe.</head>
               <p>MR. Worthy filled up every page of life with ſomething uſeful. While he taught his children, his grain was growing, and his herds were feeding; for he had not neglected any portion of that time which was neceſſary to put theſe in their proper train. His early days had been attended with great difficulty, and every thing ſeemed to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But the ſcene had been chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him for a long time, and his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity ſeemed ſo fixed that he might begin to think with a good man of old, "that his mountain ſtood ſo ſtrong that it never could be moved." This is too commonly the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of continued proſperity. It makes men ſecure. They are apt to think that tomorrow will be as today. It is poſſible that this was the caſe with Mr. Worthy, and that it was neceſſary that he ſhould be reminded of the falibility of his condition.
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:025609_0181_0FCE115AA8E14178"/>
Be this as it may, he was taught by a ſevere ſtroke, how frail he and his deareſt earthly enjoyments were. In the midſt of his proſperity, as he was ſmoothly ſailing down the current, a melancholy event took place which tried his fortitude as a man, and his reſignation as a chriſtian—an event that ſpread melancholy through the houſe, and would have overwhelmed him and his wife with inſupportable grief, had they made no other proviſion for an evil day than what worldly poſſeſſions could afford. But to a good man nothing is evil but ſin. The heart that is guarded by the exerciſes of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, is defended againſt the ſharp arrows of affliction; and the tidings of evil, however ſudden, do not ſurpriſe it, becauſe it "is fixed, truſting in God."</p>
               <p>Charles, now in the bloom of youth, as he was attempting to croſs a mill pond fell in, and was drowned. The body was recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome difficulty; but there were no ſigns of life. The tidings flew to his father and mother, who were thrown into great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. How then were they cut to the heart to ſee their beloved Charles brought in a lifeleſs corpſe? No language can paint their diſtreſs—no heart conceive it, but ſuch as have experienced the like! When they
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:025609_0182_0FCE115E2C5A37B0"/>
found every effort they made to recover him was in vain, they acquieſced in the painful event, ſaying, "The will of the Lord be done." They endeavoured to comfort their children, who were crying ready to break their hearts. This rational conduct of the parents had a good effect on the children, who followed their example in being quiet. Their conduct under this affliction was an example to all their neighbors. They were ſenſibly affected, indeed, by the death of ſo amiable and promiſing a ſon; but they conſidered it as an event taking place under a wiſe Providence that ruleth over all, and as a proper trial of their chriſtian temper; and as they conſidered ſubmiſſion to the will of God to be a great chriſtian duty, ſo they endeavored to be an example of it to all who ſaw them.</p>
               <p>The ſolemnity with which the funeral was attended, was ſuch as left a deep impreſſion on the minds of all who were preſent on the occaſion, eſpecially the youth. Well might they be affected at the ſight of ſo fine a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cut down, and withering beneath the ſtroke of death! They ſaw that life is but a vapour that appeareth for a little while and then vaniſheth away. They heard the voice of Providence ſpeaking to them in
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:025609_0183_0FCE115F10B8A7A8"/>
language louder than ſevenfold peals of thunder—"Be ye alſo ready, for the ſon of man cometh at an hour ye think not of." The improvement which Mr. and Mrs. Worthy deſired to make of this breech up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their family, was to pay the more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their remaining children, to be more careful than ever to "bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." This reſolution Mr. Worthy ſuggeſted to the clergyman, when on on a viſit to his houſe in conſequence of this affliction, who in reply to it, after ſaying many comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, obſerved, that to ſeaſon the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of youth with devotion is a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant article in their education. This is a ſpark, which if kindled in the mind at an early period, and conſtantly fanned by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental care, will ſeldom expire but with life. It may, indeed, appear to be extinguiſhed for a time by the heats of youth, the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vice, or the cares of the world; but will generally diſcover itſelf again, when age or misfortunes reſtore the mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection and conſideration. Without devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what are the virtues of temperance, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and juſtice, but qualities neceſſary to our preſent ſtate, and which men will prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe no longer than their own preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:025609_0184_0FCE11608A25CB28"/>
dictates? "Devotion," continued Mr. Villars, "opens the mind to great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, fills it with ſublime ideas, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it far beyond the regions of the moſt exalted ſcience, and ſwells the ſoul with the pureſt pleaſures. The mind being early inſpired with juſt and high ideas of the majeſty of God, and of his univerſal preſence, and often reimpreſſed with this ſenſe, will feel the full force of moral obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. As naturally as the ſprings that deſcend from the neighboring hills and ſpread on the plains below, will produce fruit for the uſe of man; the child, thus trained, will feel its obligation to parents and to ſociety. Where the foundation is thus laid, ſaid he, the ſuperſtructure may be eaſily raiſed. Its riſe and growth will be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with delight. The child, thus trained, will be prepared to be incorporated into the body of men, whom it has been taught to treat with honor and reſpect; and will be able to diſcharge the duties of that ſtate of life to which he may be called in ſociety. As they are prepared in the beſt manner for the duties and enjoyments of life by a pious education, ſo are they alſo prepared for death. That is, the parents have done all in their power to have their minds in
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:025609_0185_0FCE1164640A7890"/>
readineſs for ſudden death, ſhould it pleaſe that God to whom they have been dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to take them away in that manner by death."—Mrs. Worthy melted into tears at this obſervation. Mr. Villars, obſerving her trouble, only ſaid, "Whatever may be their lot in the world, they muſt be good, and endeavor to do good, if they would be happy either here or hereafter."</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. Mr. Worthy viſits Mr. Belmont—his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there—an affecting account of the death of Selina Belmont, by another hand.</head>
               <p>THE tranquillity of the houſe being reſtored, and the minds of the family com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, Mr. Worthy made a journey to—, where Mr. Belmont lived. As his buſineſs led him to this place, he reſolved on making Mr. Belmont a viſit, this being the firſt time of his going there ſince that gentleman's misfortune at his houſe. Mr. Worthy had no doubt of a kind reception from him, but was not ſo certain with regard to Mrs. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. He was made acquainted with her haughty ſpirit, while at his houſe, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that a plain farmer, coming into her fine houſe on a viſit, might not be very welcome. But as he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very preſſing invitation from Mr. Belmont, both when he left his houſe, and by letter afterwards, he ordered his buſineſs ſo as to make a tarry of a day or two in town. When he found a little leiſure from buſineſs, he took the opportunity to call on Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, who received him with the greateſt
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:025609_0187_0FCE11674B53E700"/>
hoſpitality, and what ſurpriſed him, was that Mrs. Belmont ſeemed equally glad to ſee him. The welcome was ſo friendly that he could have no doubt of its ſincerity. Tho they received him in the moſt courteous manner, yet Mr. Worthy obſerved a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy appearance to which they were not accuſtomed. This accorded to his own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at this time. It recommended Mrs. Belmont to him very much; for her mind was caſt in a milder form than when he ſaw her laſt. Their converſation was of a tenor different from what he expected, for their hearts had been taught to feel by one of thoſe ſtrokes, which never fail to ſoften every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as well as to teach the moſt uſeful leſſon.</p>
               <p>After cond<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ing with Mr. Worthy on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the untimely death of his amiable little ſon, Mr. Belmont told him that he was not alone in affliction. "Its arrows, ſaid he, are thrown at others, and their ſharp points, pierce the heart with many a pang. No ſituation in life is exempt from this; and if the effects of our grief were as laſting as they are deep and affecting, their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would ceaſe but with life itſelf. But altho the effects from the conſideration of death are not conſtant and prevailing, yet
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:025609_0188_0FCE11699E6F2340"/>
theſe thoughts will frequently preſs upon the imagination, however little influence they may have on the mind in their receſs." But, he obſerved, that he had no need of the aid of imagination, that he felt all he ſaid; and you may this day, ſaid he, be taught by a ſympathetic enjoyment, that "it is better to go to the houſe of mourning, than to the houſe of feaſting." Saying this, he invited Mr. Worthy to go with him into another room. On opening the door of a large hall, which was darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the window ſhutters, there appeared in the centre of the room, a ſhrouded corpſe—Mr. Worthy, who had not been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the melancholy circumſtance, ſtood amazed at it, and at the ſtriking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt between the elegance of the room, and the humilitating ſtate of death.—"There," ſaid Mr. Belmont—a tear ſuddenly ſtarting in his eye, and his voice faltering—"There are the remains of the beſt, the lovelieſt child that ever lived to bleſs, or died to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a parent's heart."—He would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, but fullneſs of grief prevented his utterance—Mr. Worthy ſtood motionleſs, and gazed with ſilent aſtoniſhment.—When Mr. Belmont had recovered himſelf ſo far as to go on, he obſerved to Mr. Worthy—
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:025609_0189_0FCE10B5F0BC1300"/>
"This is the dear child of whom you heard us ſo often ſpeak when at your houſe. It is the lovely Selina—my only daughter! But the will of the lord is done, and ſhe is no more!"—He ceaſed, and turned from the affecting ſight.—To behold a young lady of her accompliſhments, torn from the arms of her doating parents in the bloom of youth and beauty, was a ſight that overpowered the manly fortitude of Mr. Worthy. He turned away; and as he walked along, the tear of ſympathy ran down his cheek. He ſeemed for a while to forget his own afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to be ſwallowed up in that of Mr. and Mrs. Belmont. The following account of her character and death, with moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon it, was given by another hand.</p>
               <p>"On the twenty ſecond inſtant, at three o'clock in the morning, departed this life, Miſs Selina Belmont, in the twenty firſt year of her age.—To the beauty of her perſon, and the excellence of her natural diſpoſition, parents equally indulgent and attentive, had done the fulleſt juſtice. Nothing had been ſpared that could have any tendency to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh her perſon, or cultivate her mind.

fondneſs, or untimely vanity. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived admiration with a grace, and received it from all who knew her. Notwithſtanding the poliſh of her education, and her admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonal accompliſhments, ſhe appeared to the ignorant, unaſſuming, and to the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt people, unaffected. Her death may be aſcribed to the exceſs of her benevolence. A violent fever, occaſioned by her unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attention to a ſick friend, cut off her parent's hopes in a few days—hopes which were ripening to reward all their care! Such domeſtic diſtreſſes open the paſſage to the keeneſt ſenſibility. They touch the heart in the tendereſt manner. The parents were looking forward to more advanced age, when Selina's virtues would be their comfort. But, alas, Selina is no more! She died at a time when every tongue was eloquent in her praiſe. In her, centered the admiration of the faſhionable, and the eſteem of the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. She combined gracefulneſs with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in her deportment, in ſuch a manner as to appear ſuperior to thoſe with whom ſhe mixed; yet this ſuperiority was ſo tempered with modeſty as not to excite either envy or jealouſy. The tranſition was ſo great and ſudden, that it ſeemed like the painting of a dream. But, alas, the melancholly
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:025609_0191_0FCE116F0282F1C0"/>
truth ſtood confeſt in a ſhrouded corpſe—Selina is no more! What faith, what piety, what reſignation are neceſſary on ſuch an occaſion, to compoſe the heart of doating parents, bending over the grave of a darling child? What is the language of ſuch an event, but that we look back on this world with pity rather than envy, and forward to the next, with humble hope of that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality which is brought to light by the goſpel."</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXV. Mr. Worthy returns home with tokens of gratitude from Mr. and Mrs. Belmont. They ſend books to his children, from which he collects uſeful ſtories—The ſtory of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda and Almerina.</head>
               <p>THE heart was now ſoftened by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and gave ſcope to the exerciſe of the natural principles, unobſtructed by pride and vanity. It was on this occaſion, that Mrs. Belmont diſcovered the operation of the natural ſentiments of gratitude. Beſides the declaration of her ſenſe of his goodneſs to her huſband, and herſelf, while at his houſe, in which he was very laviſh, ſhe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his acceptance of a preſent to his wife. He took it and thanked her for her polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They alſo preſented him ſeveral books from their daughter's library, for the children, beſides ſome other little matters. On his arrival home he was received by his wife and children, with that open hearted cheerfulneſs, which is the beſt evidence of
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:025609_0193_0FCE1172C850EFD0"/>
affection. This always afforded him the greateſt pleaſure and ſatisfaction. When he had diſpoſed his affairs, ſo as to ſit down with his family, he related over what he had ſeen. When he came to tell of his reception at Mr. Belmont's, it was very grateful to his wife. But when he came to the melancholly account of what he had ſeen, Mrs. Worthy liſtened with a tearful attention; and the children were bathed in tears, at hearing about the death of poor Miſs Selina Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Worthy came to open the budget for his wife, he found it to be a ſilk gown, which ſhe accepted thankfully. The books, and little matters for the children, were brought forth, and preſented them from Mr. and Mrs. Belmont. Theſe they received with many thanks. They were delighted with their preſents; but Mrs. Worthy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared moſt gratified by the books. She obſerved, that "the other things were deſigned to adorn the outſide, but books will help the underſtanding; and, for my part, ſaid ſhe, I ſhall be much better pleaſed with having your heads furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well within, than adorned without.
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:025609_0194_0FCE117410DF2EF0"/>
To behave well, to ſtudy to know your duty to God and man, to love one another, and to be induſtrious, ſhe ſaid, ſhe preferred to all the adorning in the world without it."</p>
               <p>While a lengthy dialogue was carrying on among the children, and between them and their mother, Mr. Worthy was looking over the books he had brought home. In one of them he happened to meet with a ſtory that applied to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation Mrs. Worthy made, concerning im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the mind in knowledge and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, rather than adorning the body. "In order to convince you more thoroughly of the truth of theſe things, ſaid Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, I will read you a pretty ſtory of a good lady who had two daughters, one of whom was very fond of gay dreſs, the other was very differently diſpoſed. He then read as follows, while they liſtened with great eagerneſs.</p>
               <p>"There lived in the city of Fair Haven, a very good lady, who beſides ſeveral ſons, had two daughters. Theſe were poſſeſſed of very different diſpoſitions. She early taught them that, "a meek and quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit" was the true ornament of a female. It
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:025609_0195_0FCE1175E9776EC8"/>
gave her pain to find that notwithſtanding all her inſtructions, Lucinda, her eldeſt daughter, had a growing fondneſs for gay dreſs, and for fine things; but it afforded her great pleaſure to find that Almerina, her youngeſt daughter, was a good little girl, and had rather give her money, and even all the clothes ſhe could ſpare, to the poor, than buy fine things to adorn her perſon. This good lady obſerving theſe things, began to think by what means ſhe could cure her eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt daughter of this fooliſh diſpoſition, and inſpire her with the ſame kind and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition that generally actuated Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merina. In order to effect ſo deſirable an end, ſhe took them both with her to viſit a poor diſtreſſed woman, who had called at her door for charity. This poor woman was ſo waſted with poverty that ſhe could afford but little nouriſhment to her infant, which ſeemed half ſtarved. This charitable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man found that ſhe lived in a ſmall tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not far off, and that her huſband had got reduced through misfortune. Mrs. Goodwin, for that was the name of this charitable lady, took pains to inform herſelf as to the character of this poor woman, and her huſband, and the cauſes of their poverty.
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:025609_0196_0FCE1177DE18F0D8"/>
When ſhe was convinced that it was the misfortune, and not the faults of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that had reduced them, ſhe went the more cheerfully to their relief. Having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this ſatisfaction, Mrs. Goodwin and her two daughters followed the poor woman through a dark alley into a cold dark half cellar, where the cheerful rays of the ſun never came. The huſband, pale and wan through pain and poverty, ſat on a form near a few cinders, the only fuel they had. Two half naked children ſat ſhivering by his ſide. The laſt morſel of bread was gone, and wretchedneſs in the extreme, ſtared them in the face.</p>
               <p>The ſight of ſo much poverty greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Mrs. Goodwin. She could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the tear that ſtole down her check on this occaſion. Her daughters, whoſe little hearts were touched with the tendereſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, burſt into tears. It was on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that Lucinda firſt felt the ſenſe of ſhame for throwing away her money for the meereſt trifles, when there were ſo many ſuffering for want of food and raiment. Her mortification was much increaſed when ſhe ſaw how much joy Almerina's preſents occaſioned in this abode of diſtreſs. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:025609_0197_0FCE117950D1A618"/>
begged her mamma to permit her to give the children ſome of her fine things; but ſhe was informed that her fine clothes could do them no good. This viſit afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much relief to the diſtreſſed family, but Lucinda had the mortification of coming away without having contributed in the leaſt towards it. She ſaw the poor little children thanking her mamma and her ſiſter for the good things they gave them, and heard the poor man and his wife beſtowing their benedictions upon them as the authors of their ſupport and comfort, while they looked ſhy at her, and ſeemed to ſheer off from her.</p>
               <p>When they had left this dreary abode, and were on their return home, Mrs. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win aſked Lucinda which ſhe thought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the greateſt enjoyment, the pleaſure of relieving the diſtreſſed, or that which fine clothes gave. But without waiting an anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, ſhe replied to her own queſtion—"I know your ſentiments already. I ſaw your feelings. I am ſure you wiſhed your orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments further, that you might have had ſomthing to beſtow on theſe poor children. You ſaw, my dear, how thankful they were, and how much pleaſure your ſiſter enjoyed
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:025609_0198_0FCE118CCA3213B0"/>
in relieving them." To all this Lucinda conſented by a bluſh and a tear. Her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſured her that ſhe had great pleaſure in hoping that this viſit would have a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good effect upon her mind, and told her that there were multitudes of poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in as bad a condition as thoſe whom they had ſeen. Mrs. Goodwin aſſured Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda that prodigality and generoſity could not be indulged together; that in order to be generous and charitable, we muſt uſe econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy with what we have; and that we may be able to relieve others, it is neceſſary to deny ourſelves. When we have done good to our fellow creature, and given relief to the diſtreſſed, we may thank God that he has made us his inſtruments of mercy to others, and commit ourſelves to ſleep with a ſatisfaction that trifles never can afford. That is a narrow mind indeed that ſaves only for itſelf, to gratify the fancy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the appetite. The benevolent curb both, that they may give ſcope to the noble feelings of the heart. Thoſe who ſquander away their money, defraud the poor of their portion, and deprive themſelves of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of doing good. Thoſe who wiſh to be uſeful, muſt govern their deſires, and muſt
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:025609_0199_0FCE117C49E9D398"/>
not wait for objects of charity to come to them, but muſt ſometimes ſearch them out. In the country, where we live in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, poverty is not uſually attended with ſuch circumſtances of diſtreſs as we have this day been witneſs to; but in great towns, many families may be found in a ſituation ſimilar to theirs. How many of our fellow creatures are there pining away in poverty and ſickneſs, in dark and wretched places, for the want of thoſe things which the finery of others would procure?"—Lucinda wept at this laſt expreſſion, recollecting the miſery ſhe had ſeen, and that having laid out all her money for fine clothes, it was not in her power to afford the ſufferers any relief—"Yes, continued Mrs. Goodwin, there are many ſecluded from the public eye, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with pain, emaciated by ſickneſs, and made wretched by poverty, who might be relieved, and rendered happy by the money which the taudry finery of many coſt, over and above decent and good dreſs." The ſtory being finiſhed, the tear of ſenſibility ſtarted from the eyes of the children, and they exclaimed, as though actuated by one ſoul—"I could work all day to relieve them, and give them poor folks my beſt clothes rather than they ſhould be diſtreſſed." It
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:025609_0200_0FCE117DF5BF9CF0"/>
was not long before they had the ſtrength of their benevolence tried, by an affecting event that happened not far from them, as we ſhall relate in its proper place.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. Mr. Worthy's obſervations on the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, eſpecially on farmers employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their evenings and leiſure hours—of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing ſocial libraries—Mentor's obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on diligence, induſtry and a proper uſe of time.</head>
               <p>I WOULD not be underſtood to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt that either Mr. or Mrs. Worthy were wholly without faults in the management of their children, or in the government of their own paſſions. They often erred in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. But it would be an unpleaſant taſk to relate the foibles of thoſe who are conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavouring to correct themſelves. It was their uniform wiſh that their children might "be as plants grown up in their youth, and come forward on the ſtage of action under the influence of ſuch impreſſions as would make them the moſt uſeful members of ſociety, and moſt happy in themſelves. They are certainly entitled to much credit for the exertions they uſed to effect their wiſhes, and if they erred at any time it was
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:025609_0202_0FCE118143F33EE8"/>
not for want of good intentions. They had watched, with parental care and anxiety, the dawn of their children's minds, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of their judgment, had endeavoured to inſtruct, impreſs, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them. They now began to ſee the good effects of their exertion in the eldeſt, who were advancing towards that period in which more manly exerciſes were required, as their conduct appeared to be the effect of more mature judgment. The youngeſt ſtill required the attention proper for child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.</p>
               <p>To vary the mode of treatment towards children in the ſeveral ſtages, from eight to eighteen, and make it ſuitable to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate periods, and alſo to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date it to the different ſexes, is a taſk that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great watchfulneſs, and conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion. Theſe parents were fully ſenſible of the difficulty. They often converſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it between themſelves, and obſerved it to others; and found that they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the opinion. Difficult as the taſk may ſeem, yet in juſtice to them, it muſt be ſaid, they managed it with great ſkill. To keep them out of idleneſs, and give them proper ſentiments of the value of time, and a careful improvement of it, was conſidered
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:025609_0203_0FCE11824FDAA3B8"/>
an object of great importance both to their virtue and happineſs. Their ideas on this head extended not only to diligence in the uſual hours of labor, but to a proper uſe of thoſe hours which we call leiſure. There is much time loſt under the notion of leiſure hours. The diligent and induſtrious econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omiſt of time will find but few ſuch hours.</p>
               <p>"Tho the ſhortneſs of life, ſaid Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, is often a ſubject of great complaint by many people, yet there are very few, who make a juſt eſtimate of time. He who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders its value, and is deſirous to employ it to the beſt advantage, will find that he has none to loſe in idleneſs; nor will it hang heavy on his hands. There are many lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hours in a farmer's life, in which he could make conſiderable improvements, were they employed in a way which his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation ſeems to point out. The very buſineſs of the farmer leads him out of the way of much information, except what ariſes from his own obſervation. There are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo which his buſineſs naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords for his improvement in knowledge. Tho theſe may be conſidered as a ſmall portion, when compared with the whole, or even with that part which many others have, yet the intervals of reſt and leiſure which every farmer has, would amount to
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:025609_0204_0FCE1183D24EBCB0"/>
more time, and afford a greater opportunity than may be thought of by many. "If, ſaid he, the farmers devote their long even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſome to dozing, and others to uſeleſs amuſements, they looſe the only ſeaſon that ſeems to be aſſigned them by the very nature of their occupation for improvement." Theſe were obſervations which Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy made to a neighboring farmer, who was often complaining of the ſhortneſs of life. They were ſo juſt that he felt the force of them, and ceaſed grumbling for a while. Much of the uneaſineſs and diſcontent that appears in many, ariſes from ignorance, and the want of reſource within themſelves. How much eaſier would labor ſeem, were the farmers to employ their leiſure hours in furniſhing their minds with materials neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to carry on reflection and meditation while at labor. The mechanic labors, and the ſtudent applies to his literary purſuits, many more hours in the twenty four than the farmer does in his buſineſs. The labor of the latter is generally the moſt fatiguing to the body, but leſs ſo to the mind. It is a truth, however, eſtabliſhed on experience, that "much ſtudy is a weariſomeneſs to the <hi>fleſh.</hi>" But when the huſbandman retires from the labors of the field, his mind with
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:025609_0205_0FCE1185A90F6DC8"/>
his body is at reſt. If his mind was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſome pleaſing purſuit, it might contribute greatly to the relief of the body. It is an old ſaying, dictated by wiſdom, and found true by experience, that "a cheerful heart does good like a medicine," and it is an obſervation of equal truth, that knowledge is as grateful to the mind, as light to the eyes. How ſoothing then muſt a book of ſentimental improvement and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be to one fatigued by labor. While the pleaſant light of the riſing ſun of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was exhilirating the ſpirits by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical operation on the ſyſtem, the fatigue of the body would be forgotten in the midſt of brighter ſcenes.</p>
               <p>The eſtabliſhment of ſocial libraries in our towns and pariſhes would have a happy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to encourage reading, and cultivating the mind and manners of our fellow citizens. It is a fact that muſt afford peculiar pleaſure to every well wiſher to ſociety, to arts, or to religion, that theſe are already encreaſing in our country.</p>
               <p>Theſe might eaſily be eſtabliſhed in every town, by the exertion of a few individuals, firſt to collect ſmall contributions from thoſe who would be diſpoſed to aſſociate for that purpoſe. This would bring together a collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:025609_0206_0FCE1187F533ACB8"/>
of books, to the uſe of which each propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor would have an equal right under certain regulations. The advantage of having acceſs to a variety of books, greater than any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual could own, would ſoon be felt. The entertainment from books would be encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the time now ſpent in uſeleſs and coſtly amuſements, would much of it be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in reading. The ſavings by this piece of economy would ſoon reimburſe the expenſes of the library, and make yearly additions to it. This would ſurely be a very happy change in the mode of expenſes, and probably in the courſe of a few years would be found to be a great ſaving of them. In order to make reading a general thing, and to induce young people profitably to fill up their vacant hours, it is neceſſary to furniſh children with books ſuitable to their age, with which the world abounds, and train them up in the habit of reading them. If they are accuſtomed to improve their time well, they will read for the ſake of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rather than be idle, and when reading has become a habit, the pleaſure of it will encreaſe.</p>
               <p>"Diligence and induſtry, ſaid Mentor to his young friend, are material duties of the young. To no purpoſe are they endowed
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:025609_0207_0FCE11890A80CFF0"/>
with the beſt abilities, if they want activity for exerting them. Unavailing, in this caſe, will be every direction that can be given them, either for their temporal or ſpiritual welfare. In youth, ſaid he, the habits of induſtry are moſt eaſily acquired—in youth the incentives to it are ſtrongeſt, from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and from duty, from emulation and hope, from all the proſpects which the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of life affords. If, deaf to thoſe calls, you already languiſh in flothful inactivity, what will be able to quicken the more ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh current of advancing life? Induſtry is not only the inſtrument of improvement, but the foundation of pleaſure. Nothing is ſo oppoſite to the true enjoyment of life as the relaxed and feeble ſtate of mind in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent. He who is a ſtranger to induſtry, may poſſeſs, but he cannot enjoy. It is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor only which gives the reliſh to pleaſure. It is the appointed vehicle of every good to man. It is the indiſpenſable condition of our poſſeſſing a ſound mind in a ſound body. Sloth is ſo inconſiſtent with both, that it is hard to determine whether it be a greater foe to virtue or to health and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. It not only ſaps the foundation of every virtue, but pours upon you a del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:025609_0208_0FCE118B615AB240"/>
of crimes and evils.—Fly, therefore, ſaid Mentor, fly from idleneſs, as the certain parent both of guilt and ruin. I mean, continued Mentor, under the head of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to include all that circle of trifling oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations in which too many ſaunter away their youth, perpetually engaged in frivolous ſociety, or in uſeleſs amuſements; in the labors of dreſs, or in the oſtentation of their perſons.—Is this the foundation, my young friend, which you lay for future uſefulneſs and eſteem? By ſuch accompliſhments, do you hope to recommend yourſelf to the thinking part of the world, and to anſwer the expectations of your friends and your country? Amuſements, indeed, are allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they are neceſſary for youth as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, but culpable as the buſineſs of life. They then become the gulph of time, and the poiſon of the mind. They ferment bad paſſions. They weaken the manly powers. They ſink the native vigor of youth into contemptible effeminacy and unmanlineſs.</p>
               <p>From ſuch dangerous waſte of time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, redeem your time, and ſeek to fill it with employments which you may review with ſatisfaction. The acquiſition of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge is one of the moſt honorable occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of youth. The deſire of it diſcovers a
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:025609_0209_0FCE117ACE7EA1E0"/>
liberal mind, and is connected with many accompliſhments, and many virtues. But though your train of life ſhould not lead you to ſtudy, the courſe of education always furniſhes proper employment to a well diſpoſed mind. Whatever you purſue be emulous to excel. Generous ambition, and ſenſibility to praiſe, are among the marks of virtue, eſpecially at your age.</p>
               <p>"No rank or condition of life can exempt any one from the duties of application and induſtry. Induſtry is the law of our being; it is the demand of nature, of reaſon, and of God. Remember always, my young friend, that the years which now paſs over your head, leave permanent memorials behind them. They form an important part of the regiſter of your life; and will hereafter bear teſtimony either for or againſt you.—Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your future courſe is deſtined to be long or ſhort, after this manner it ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence; and if it continue to be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, its concluſion, at what time ſoever it arrives, will not be inglorious or unhappy."</p>
               <p>The youth dropped the tear of gratitude for Mentor's friendly counſel, and by a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful nod, ſhewed that he ſaw the truth, and felt the importance of what he had been ſaying.</p>

               <p>MR. Blanford, of whom I had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak before, was ſo pleaſed with the country, that he reſolved on making a purchaſe when a fair opportunity ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. To gain a ſettlement in the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Mr. Worthy, was an object with him. When, therefore, he heard that Mr. Slack's farm was upon ſale, he went to take a view of it. He purchaſed the place, and as ſoon as he could put his affairs in order, he took poſſeſſion of it. The arrival of ſuch a neighbor, was noſmall acquiſition to Mr. Worthy, and Mr. Blanford afterwards owned to his friends that, "had it not been for Mr. Worthy, he knew not how he ſhould have carried on his firſt attempts at farming." An acquaintance commenced between them,

and their families, which grew into intimacy, and became the bond of permanent friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. This intimacy was uſeful to both, by affording each an opportunity to aſſiſt the other in thoſe things wherewith he was moſt acquainted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Worthy was not only acquainted with agriculture but with the ſeveral branches of the huſbandry<note n="*" place="bottom">Tho the word huſbandry is commonly uſed as if it were perfectly ſynonymous with agriculture, it is in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a word of larger ſignification.

                  </note> art, which he had ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied as a practical ſcience. He was therefore able to afford Mr. Blanford the advice which he frequently needed in carrying on his buſineſs to the beſt advantage. The fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies alſo, beſides the uſual offices of neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs, were mutually beneficial to each other. The young ladies who came from town being unacquainted with the buſineſs of their preſent ſituation, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of knowing ſomething of it. While Mrs. Worthy's daughters could aſſiſt them in learning ſome of thoſe neceſſary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they were ready to lend the aid of their inſtruction in ſome of the finer parts of nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:025609_0212_0FCE11938B92FB70"/>
work, and in giving their dreſs a little more faſhionable air, which was very pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the young Miſs Worthys. But this intercourſe between theſe two families, too convenient and agreeable on many accounts, was not without its inconveniencies. Mrs. Worthy, perceiving that the gayer dreſs of the Miſs Blanfords made her daughters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy with their plain dreſs, permitted them to ſend ſome cloth of their own make to procure the neceſſary articles of female at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. She did not, however, gratify them as far as they wiſhed, but as far as ſhe thought proper. In this Mrs. Worthy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered great prudence; for on the one hand, if ſhe had wholly denied them this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male gratification, they would have been mortified and diſcouraged; and on the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, an unlimited indulgence would have been a great diſadvantage, as the things they made were much more uſeful and durable than thoſe they bought; and beſides, it is more reſpectable for a farmer's family to be cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their own manufacture than in that which comes from abroad. Mrs. Worthy reconciled the minds of her daughters by theſe arguments, and by reminding them that the young ladies, whoſe appearance had excited their ambition, had been bred
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:025609_0213_0FCE11951BB110C8"/>
up in town, where faſhionable dreſs was much more attended to, than in the rural ſtate wherein they lived; and alſo that Mr. Blanford could afford it much better than they. Mrs. Worthy pointed out many poorer families, whoſe dreſs was as much plainer than theirs, as theirs was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Miſs Blanfords; telling them at the ſame time, that all judicious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would look upon them the better for appearing according to their ſtation and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and for ſuiting their dreſs to the place where they lived. The Miſs Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords were delighted with Mrs. Worthy. They were loud in her praiſes to their friends in the the town, on account of her agreeable manners as a country gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and alſo on account of the ſerene and placid mind which ſhe always diſcovered. They often added to the little domeſtic cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that ſurrounded Mrs. Worthy in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon or on a pleaſant evening. It was on one of thoſe occaſions, as ſhe was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by her daughters, and their young friends, when the placid beams of the riſing moon had ſoothed all their feelings, and the diſtant caſcade gently murmured on their ears, that Mrs. Worthy pleaſantly inſtructed them by the following fable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="unknown:025609_0214_0FCE1197593337B8"/>
"Labor, the offspring of Want and the mother of Health and Contentment, lived with her two daughters in a little cottage, by the ſide of a hill, at a great diſtance from town. They were totally unacquainted with the great, and had kept no better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany than the neighboring villagers; but having a deſire to ſee the world, they forſook their companions and their habitation, and determined to travel. Labor went ſoberly along the road with Health on her right hand, who by the ſprightlineſs of her converſation and ſongs of cheerfulneſs and joy, ſoftened the toils of the way, while Contentment went ſmiling on the left, ſupporting the ſteps of her mother, and by her perpetual good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor encreaſing the vivacity of her ſiſter.</p>
               <p>"In this manner they travelled over for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, and through towns and villages, till at the laſt they arrived at the capital of the kingdom. At their entrance into the city, the mother conjured her daughters never to looſe ſight of her; for it was the will of Jupiter, ſhe ſaid, that their ſeparation ſhould be attended with the utter ruin of all three. But Health was of too gay a diſpoſition to regard the counſels of Labor; ſhe ſuffered herſelf to be debauched by Intemperance, and at laſt died in child birth of Diſeaſe.
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:025609_0215_0FD0043E5FC1A768"/>
Contentment, in the abſence of her ſiſter, gave herſelf up to the enticement of Sloth, and was never heard of after; while Labor, who could have no enjoyment without her daughters, went every where in ſearch of them, till ſhe was at laſt ſeized by Laſſitude in her way, and died in miſery."</p>
               <p>The young ladies expreſſed the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they felt from the amuſing fable; and were delighted with the engaging manner in which Mrs. Worthy introduced it. It was by her gentleneſs and good advice, and by encouraging their induſtry with due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, ſhowing thoſe young ladies when there on a viſit, her daughters nice work, that they gained the aſcendency of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo far, as to be able to ſee their finery without an uneaſy feeling, or even a wiſh to ſacrifice intereſt and convenience for the ſake of obtaining it. The Miſs Blanfords, on the other hand, began to be more and more deſirous to imitate, and if poſſible to equal, thoſe ſamples of induſtry and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity which the Miſs Worthys exhibited. As this diſpoſition encreaſed, it was obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that their regard for gay dreſs leſſened; and it was not long before they could give ſome good ſpecimens of their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII. Mr. Worthy corrects ſome falſe notions in his children.—Story of Mr. Lordly—and Mr. Blanford's deſcription of a venerable oak.</head>
               <p>A SIMILAR ſpirit began to make its appearance among Mr. Worthy's ſons. Of this ſpirit he endeavored to cure them by many uſeful leſſons. As they were paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a beautiful meadow that abounded with various flowers, which were pleaſing to the eye, he aſked his little ſons if they did not think that a pleaſant place to work in. "O yes, ſay they, it is ſo ſmooth and beautiful, that it muſt be eaſier to work there than in our field, where it is rough and hard; and beſides, how charming muſt them flowers make it?"—"My children, replied Mr. Worthy, you do not conſider that there are many poiſonous weeds lurking about under thoſe flowers, which would deſtroy your health, and give you pain. Juſt ſo it is with many who are rich; their circumſtances look fair and pleaſant, and they ſeem to live
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:025609_0217_0FD004414D2CF0A8"/>
at eaſe; but under this appearance often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lurk many evil weeds which poiſon all their enjoyments. They often envy the contentment that poor people enjoy. So true it is, "that man's life does not conſiſt in the abundance which he poſſeſſeth." He recommended to them, contentment in their condition; and never to deſpiſe the poor, or covet the rich man's condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both are liable to temptations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities; and neither of them deſtitute of enjoyments. This truth, he ſaid, was fully proved in the ſtory of Mr. Lordly, who was a rich, but envious man, and oppreſſed his neighbor Penury to a very great degree. As they had now reached their own field, Mr. Worthy ſaid that he would take an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſoon to rehearſe it to them.</p>
               <p>When the ſun began to ſcorch them by its heat, and their fatigue required them to retire to the ſpreading oak, where they went to ſeek reſt in the cooling ſhade, Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy renewed the ſubject, and told his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and the other laborers that as a reward for their diligence and exertions, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them from their fatigue, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to them the ſtory he had mentioned.—"In a diſtant part of the country, and not many years ago, there lived a rich man who
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:025609_0218_0FD00442D78C9080"/>
was poſſeſſed of all the means of ſatisfaction and enjoyment, that the world could give, without the power of enjoying any thing. His wealth made him haughty and inſolent, and indolence made him fretful and peeviſh. He was troubled with many pains which aroſe from the manner of his living, and which made him very impatient. I ſhall conceal his real name, and call him Lordly. There was a poor man whom I ſhall call Penury, who lived not far from him. Mr. Penury was a harmleſs inoffenſive man, and went ſinging, or whiſtling, by Mr. Lordly's, to his daily labor. The health and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this poor man appeared to enjoy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the envy of Mr. Lordly, who deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to deſtroy the little means of ſubſiſtence that his family enjoyed. They were, like himſelf, robuſt and healthy, having no means of luxury, and being obliged to labor. He accordingly ordered his people to let looſe his great maſtiff dog upon the only cow the poor man owned, and from which his family drew much of their nouriſhment. The dog chaſed her into a quagmire, where ſhe died, and then turned and devoured the coſſet lamb that followed her where ever ſhe went. It was all the lamb the poor man owned." Little Joſeph, who was all attention to ſuch
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:025609_0219_0FCF4B0172B7F2A0"/>
ſtories, could not contain himſelf any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. He exclaimed againſt that rich man, who could be ſo cruel to Mr. Penury; and "wiſhed ſomebody had killed that great ugly dog before he had killed that poor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lamb." When each one had made his obſervation on the baſeneſs of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, Mr. Worthy continued the ſtory.—</p>
               <p>"It happened that a war with the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſavages broke out about this time. Mr. Penury, who ſuffered many other cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties from Mr. Lordly, was willing to riſque any thing, rather than continue to live near ſo unjuſt and cruel a man. He enliſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the troops raiſed for the defence of the frontier ſettlements. Leaving the ſmall bounty he received with his family for their ſupport and comfort, he went forward and joined his company. It ſo happened that in the firſt attack of the enemy Mr. Penury was taken priſoner and the troops were rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The news of this defeat alarmed Mr. Lordly, who began now to apprehend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in danger, for the enemy poured down toward that part of the country where he lived. He determined to ſeek his ſafety by flight. But by attempting this acroſs the country, he fell in the way of a party of bold warriors, who had ventured far down
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:025609_0220_0FD00447794B8E88"/>
into the country. They made him their priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, and carried him into their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where the ſavages had carried Mr. Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury a little before.</p>
               <p>"They were not treated with thoſe acts of cruelty which often take place in ſuch caſes; but were put immediately to do their drudgery. Lordly, who had lived an idle life, made a poor figure at this buſineſs, while Penury, who had been accuſtomed to labor and hard fare, did his duty well, and pleaſed his new maſters very much. He grew daily in their eſteem, and was obliged to help his more unfortunate fellow priſoner, to ſave him from the many ſeverities with which they threatened him. They made him a kind of ſervant to the other, and obliged him to obey him. Penury treated his new ſervant with great lenity and kindneſs, during the whole time they were in this ſituation. At laſt they were redeemed. But Penury had ſo ingratiated himſelf with them that it was with difficulty his releaſe could be obtained. Returning to their native country, Mr. Lordly was fully convinced of the injuſtice of his former conduct, and of the equity of divine providence in his captivity, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. As a compenſation for the injuries he had formerly done to Mr. Penury, and
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:025609_0221_0FD0044988A1DAA8"/>
as an acknowledgment of the noble ſpirit he diſcovered during their diſtreſsful cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, he offered to ſupport him ever after in eaſe. To which Mr. Penury replied, that he had been bred up to hard labor and coarſe fare—that as to idleneneſs and riches he ſhould not know what to do with them; he had been very happy and contented without them, and that he deſired nothing more than to be placed in his former ſituation, in which, by the bleſſing of God and a good conſcience, he could enjoy himſelf undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed. Mr. Lordly was ſurpriſed at ſo much generoſity in ſo poor a man. He could not help reflecting, that many a princely ſoul might be found in cottages, and many a philoſopher following the plough. He was made much wiſer than he ever was before, and probably than ever he would have been, had he not have been made ſo by misfortune. He ſaw, and acknowledged, the hand of providence in all he had been called to paſs through, and reſolved for the future on a life of piety and charity."</p>
               <p>Juſt as Mr. Worthy had finiſhed the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove narrative, Mr. Blanford arrived at the ſhady oak, where this little group of farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were refreſhing themſelves, and paſſed the remainder of their tarry under it, in
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:025609_0222_0FD0044B00D31328"/>
converſation ſuited to his new employment. Obſerving their cheerfulneſs and alacrity, which was renewed by the manner in which they had been paſſing their time, he made ſeveral ingenious obſervations, in a letter to Mr. Belmont, on the phyſical effects of reading and converſation on the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or the natural connection between amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and improvement of the mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from bodily fatigue. In this letter he ſaid many things highly applauding Mr. Worthy's manner of proceeding in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and obſerved, that altho he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed a great deal of buſineſs, yet that there was never any hurry about it, nor were any in his ſervice ever overdone with hard labor; and he could not account for it in any other way, than that of his taking ſo much pains to renew their ſpirits by thoſe ſentimental amuſements which drew their attention from labor, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated them, by inſpiring them with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous emulation for good and worthy actions.</p>
               <p>Among many other things, he gave Mr. Belmont the following deſcription of the venerable oak, under whoſe cooling ſhade he found them at the above amuſing employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—This old and lofty oak, ſays he, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:025609_0223_0FD00450019810D8"/>
the deſcription we have of that huge tree, at Huntingfield, in Suffolk, called Queen Elizabeth's Oak. This is ſaid to be "eleven yards in circumference, at the height of ſeven feet from the ground; and from the condition of other trees of the ſame ſort in different parts of the kingdom, whoſe age has been aſcertained pretty well from hiſtorical circumſtances, this muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be not leſs than five or ſix hundred years old." Though this oak, which gave ſhade and ſhelter to Mr. Worthy, was not of ſo princely a ſize, nor can I determine preciſely its age; yet this oak, like Queen Elizabeth's tree, ſtill retained ſome degree of vigor, though many of its boughs were broken off, and thoſe which remained, were approaching to decay. The principal arm, now bald with dry antiquity, ſhoots up to a lofty height, and being hollow, with ſeveral cracks reſembling loop holes, through which the light ſhines in its cavity, it gives us an idea of the winding ſtaircaſe in a lofty goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic turret, which, detached from the other ruins of ſome venerable pile, hangs totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its fall, and affects the mind of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder after the ſame manner, by its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſublimity."</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIX. The pleaſures and advantages of domeſtic intercourſe and cheerfulneſs—How to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the inconvenience of unavoidable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions at ſchool—Pleaſant inſtruction from the ſcriptures, acquaintance with them recommended, danger of making light of them—Cautions to farmers in a thunder ſtorm.</head>
               <p>THE ſtory being ended, and it being time to quit the ſhade, they all went cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to their labor, which ſeemed now to paſs on lightly. They continued to labor and reſt alternately, until the ſetting ſun in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to quit the field of labor for the peaceful abode of the beloved family, where they found Mrs. and the Miſs Blanfords on a viſit. When they had waſhed and put on ſuitable clothes, they were all introduced to the company of their new friends; and each expreſſed, either by words or by the vivacity of their countenance, the pleaſure they felt on this occaſion. The viſitants
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:025609_0226_0FD00454EDA4FB78"/>
were equally pleaſed with the neatneſs of their appearance and the propriety of their manners, which were free from that rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which many times is to be ſeen among laboring young men. There was a mildneſs and gentleneſs in their manners which made them appear very amiable, and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them very much to Mrs. Blanford, who was high in their praiſes to her huſband. As ſhe was a lady of excellent underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcernment, it was much in their favor to be ſo well approved of by her. When the viſitors were gone, Henry related the ſubſtance of the ſtory they had been entertained with, to his ſiſters, which amuſed them for the evening. This was a kind of intercourſe which Mr. and Mrs. Worthy always encouraged their family to maintain among themſelves. If one was poſſeſſed of any thing entertaining and agreeable, it was communicated to the reſt. They did not live together as too many families do, without ſeeming, to have any affection for one another, or having any agreeable ſociety together; but they converſed together, and were never more delighted than in their own domeſtic circle. This often occaſioned a ſight that made the parental breaſt heave with joyful ſenſations, when they beheld
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:025609_0227_0FD004566683F470"/>
their family liſtening to the tale of woe, or to the rehearſal of a more pleaſing ſcene, which one would exhibit while the reſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. At other times, the parent's heart is dilated with joy, while the playful tricks and innocent mirth of the children, relax their minds, and prepare them for more vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous application, or contribute to health and vivacity. The pleaſures of domeſtic life may be greatly encreaſed by theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent amuſements. This kind of intercourſe ſerves to ſoften the rougher mind and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to create a cement of affection, and a tender ſympathy that can expire but with life.</p>
               <p>In order to remedy the inconvenience ariſing from the frequent interruption of boys at ſchool, which is unavoidable in a farmer's buſineſs, Mr. Worthy would always either find a little leiſure to hear them read at home, or take a ſmall book in his pocket, that they might do it while reſting under the ſhady oak. At other times, and as they were more advanced, he helped their recollection of the ſcriptures by inquiring concerning the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of the patriarchs and good men, of whom they give an account, and what was the influence of their character on their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition. He amuſed his children
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:025609_0228_0FD00457E6F8F978"/>
by deſcribing more particularly the dreſs and manners of thoſe people—telling them how they lived—"Not in ſuch houſes as we do, but in tents, and under the ſhade of trees as we now are." He not only amuſed them by a deſcription of the rural manner of their life, but inſtructed them by relating their tranſactions, how they conducted in particular circumſtances, their obedience to the commands of God, and how well they proſpered when they obeyed, and how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely they were puniſhed for their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience when they were guilty of it. This made them well acquainted, and greatly pleaſed with the hiſtorical part of the Old Teſtament; it afforded them amuſement, while it conveyed uſeful ſentiments to the heart. In the ſame way he recommended the New Teſtament, which they read with growing pleaſure, as their minds opened to comprehend more and more of its excellent doctrines, and to ſee new beauties in the life and character of our Lord, and of his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>"I don't know, ſaid Mr. Worthy to his ſons, as they were reſting the next day, of any thing more favorable to a young man's character than his being fond of his bible. That contains a moſt glorious plan of grace—
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:025609_0229_0FD0045C062F38B0"/>
the beſt rules for conducting, with the ſtrongeſt motives to virtue. When he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to think and ſpeak lightly of that, it is an evidence that he is loſing his principles of moral action; and he is in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing led aſtray by vicious and unprincipled people. Having let go his hold of this grand pillar, he is liable to fall. So long as he reads his bible, he will be likely to mind ſomething of what it contains. If he does not read it, and diſregards what it ſays as an idle tale, he will be like a veſſel that is driven from its faſtening, and floats on a wide and boiſterous ſea. There is a connection, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Mr. Worthy, between attention to this and proſperity in the world—at leaſt, comfort and happineſs in it. This is the good man's richeſt treaſure, his greateſt delight. There is not a truer ſaying to be found than that of the wiſe man—"He that walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely."<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. x. 9.</note> It is the ſureſt way to ſucceſs in our affairs; and whether we be rich or poor, it is the ſafeſt way. I knew a perſon, ſaid he, and I doubt not but there are thouſands beſide, who always kept his bible by his bed ſide, when a young man, and after reading a chapter, would offer up prayers and praiſes
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:025609_0230_0FD0045DD7915728"/>
to God. This was his conſtant practice. He was obliged to labor all day. This was almoſt the only time he could find for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By a conſtant uſe of this opportunity, ſhort as it was, he became well acquainted with the ſcriptures. He was kept out of bad company by the influence of this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He had only his hands to begin the world with. He began it with virtue, with induſtry, and a reliance on divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He lived to bring up a large family of children well by the ſtrength of his own induſtry—was beloved and reſpected by all who knew him, and found by his own happy experience that "the ways of wiſdom were ways of pleaſantneſs"—I would therefore recommend it to you, my dear children, to make the ſame experiment."</p>
               <p>A ſudden guſt of wind, with the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a cloud at the weſtward, indicating a ſhower, induced them to go immediately to the field to finiſh what they were doing; but it was not long before the violence of the tempeſt drove them from it. Mr. Worthy called on all hands to fly to yonder copſe of wood for ſhelter, which they accordingly did. This place afforded them but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect cover from the rain and hail, which came down like a torrent, accompanied
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:025609_0231_0FD0045F51EFC048"/>
with ſharp lightning, and heavy thunder. They were very wet, and ſome of his people were much frightened, and began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that they were not under the great oak. But Mr. Worthy compoſed them by ſaying they were much more ſecure where they now were, eſpecially from the effects of the lightning. He told them of the many inſtances of perſons being killed by repairing to tall trees for a cover from a thunder ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—that he was always aware of danger from them, but that he had never been ſo fully convinced of it as he was now, ſince ſo many perſons had been killed that ſeaſon by flying to a large tree in the open field for ſhelter. "When, ſaid he, they are caught in a ſhower, they eſcape from the open field to a large tree that ſtands in the middle of it, hang up their ſcythes, or other tools made of iron, and ſit or ſtand directly under the point. The tree, being alone and a taller object than any near it, takes the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the iron attracts it, and conveys it to the man, and he is inſtantly lifeleſs, without knowing himſelf to be in danger. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſaid Mr. Worthy, I begin to fear leſt this high wind ſhould blow down the old limb that towers ſo high, though it ſhould not be ſtruck by the lightning." They
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:025609_0232_0FD00460E91113A8"/>
ſeemed ſatisfied with what Mr. Worthy ſaid on the ſubject; but, how much more reaſon had they to be thankful, when in going home after the ſhower was over, they found the limb broken off, which, in its fall, had unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately killed one of the cows who had fled thither for ſafety.—This, ſaid Mr. Worthy, is purely providential—you ſee that God has given to man more knowledge than to the beaſts of the field. Had we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted hither for ſafety, this might have been the lot of ſome of us. You ſee we are in the hands of a kind preſerver, who directs our way for us." On their return home there was great mourning for the poor cow; but the conſideration of their eſcape from the danger, was a matter of ſo great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that they ſoon forgot their misfortune.</p>
               <p>Mr. Worthy's ſentiments about avoiding the higheſt trees in an open field, were very juſt, and deſerve the attention of his brother farmers; and particularly that of hanging up their ſcythes, &amp;c. over their heads. This is found to be more dangerous in a flat open country, than in foreſts and among hills. It is obſervable that moſt of the accounts of perſons killed by lightning in the country, are in the above ſituation, during the time of harveſt and mowing.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXX. The feeling heart is touched, in this chapter, by the lively picture of fraternal affection, amidſt the changes of fortune, between four brothers, named Aſia, Africa, Europe and America.</head>
               <p>STORIES, founded on fact, or on circumſtances which might eaſily be ſuppoſed to happen in real life, may be made very uſeful in families. The moral virtues may be taught and inculcated on the heart more effectually by examples, where its tendereſt feelings are intereſted, than by any other means. It was wiſely contrived by Mr. Worthy to engage the attention of his children by theſe, while others were loſing the ſame hours in play. The following ſtory was often repeated with pleaſure amongſt them. This was ſent to Charles by Mr. Belmont as a mark of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regard to him. It did not arrive ſoon enough for that unfortunate youth to ſee. It was laid up as a kind of precious treaſure, to be a memorial of the goodneſs of that amiable child, whoſe bloſſoming vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:025609_0234_0FD0046483E471D8"/>
had ſo highly recommended him to Mr. Belmont's diſcerning mind. The ſtrong and permanent attachment of thoſe brothers, and their generous conduct, are worthy of imitation by all, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be recorded here, that they may be preſerved from oblivion.</p>
               <p>"A reputable merchant, by the name of Weatherly, who lived in Nanſemond, had four ſons; being ſomewhat ſingular in his turn, he named them Aſia, Africa, Europe and America.<note n="*" place="bottom">There is now living in the State of Maſſachuſetts a family bearing theſe names.</note> Theſe four brothers were trained up by their mother during childhood with great care. They lived together in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable good humor and harmony, tho ſomewhat different in their natural temper and diſpoſition. But, before they were either of them fit for buſineſs the eldeſt died, to the great grief of their parents. He was a promiſing youth, but, alas, ere the virtues of his mind ripened into fruit, he was cut off! The opening flower cloſed up, it faded away and was ſeen no more!" Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy could never read this without a tear. It afforded her a kind of luxurious grief, which ſhe delighted once in a while to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge, that ſhe might not looſe the pleaſing impreſſion of her beloved Charles. "The
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:025609_0235_0FD0046B29CAE9E0"/>
death of the eldeſt ſon made Mr. and Mrs. Weatherly more attentive than ever to furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the education and good morals of the others. In her early care of them, ſhe had ſo balanced their oppoſite defects as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the utmoſt harmony and brotherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and condeſcenſion. She accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to treat their elders with reſpect. This had a good affect in preventing any childiſh conteſts for the preference, as each knew, and was contented with his own rank; and always waited his proper turn. It alſo made them behave with good manners to ſtrangers, be their condition in life what it might. They were never known to treat a beggar with inſult or abuſe, but were always diſpoſed to charity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Weatherly, being a man of a literary turn, determined too give his ſons a learned education. It was not long after they were ſent to the univerſity, that he met with ſuch heavy loſſes in his buſineſs that he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to take the benefit of the bankrupt act. This made his ſituation ſo diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he determined on a voyage to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica to collect ſome debts for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his family, which he promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit as faſt as he could collect them. His wife and children were inconſolable at his
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:025609_0236_0FCE870521C62DE0"/>
leaving them; but how were their ſorrows encreaſed, when on the return of the ſhip, they not only had no remittances, but heard nothing of him. They ſoon had little left for enjoyment but brotherly love, which rather encreaſed than abated; nor any thing to recommend them to notice and eſteem but their good conduct. In this they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded well. As they heard nothing from their father it became neceſſary for them to quit the univerſity, and ſeek ſome employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that would afford them a living. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica had ſo far improved himſelf at the univerſity as to get recommended as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate tutor in a family, where he received a ſalary more than ſufficient for himſelf. He now felt himſelf happy in being able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his mother ſome aſſiſtance. Europe obtained a place with a merchant; with whom he continued the term agreed on, and being a faithful active youth the merchant took him into partnerſhip at the expiration of his apprenticeſhip. America, tho young, embraced the offer of Mr. Thornton, an old friend of his father, to take a voyage with him to ſea. As nothing better offered, he continued in that way until he was appointed mate of a ſhip up the Baltic." "Where is the Baltic daddy, ſaid one of the children,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:025609_0237_0FCE85C0B93DEA58"/>
as he was reading." "It is, ſaid he, a great gulph or ſea in Europe, that lies between Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many and Poland on the ſouth, and Sweden on the north; from which run ſeveral other gulphs. It is remarkable that this ſea nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ebbs nor ſlows, and yet there is a current that ſets through the ſound into the ocean, and it is generally frozen over three or four months in the year." Notwithſtanding his youth, continued Mr. Worthy, the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſhip determined to give him the command of one of their large ſhips on the firſt vacancy.</p>
               <p>"They had not yet been able to obtain any intelligence concerning their father. The ſucceſs that had hitherto attended them, compenſated in ſome meaſure the great loſs they ſuſtained by his abſence. But the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of Africa, happening to die about this time, deprived him of the means of further ſupport. A train of unfortunate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances embarraſſed the affairs of Europe, and after ſometime they became deſparate. In theſe reduced circumſtances he was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to live among his old acquaintance, and fooliſhly retired to a remote part of the country to ſeclude himſelf from ſociety. While he was in this retired ſtate there came along a company of ſtrolling players.
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:025609_0238_0FCE85C3621A6478"/>
He was over perſuaded to join them and go about the country acting with them. Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to theſe misfortunes, America, who had made ſeveral voyages up the Baltic, was invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home to a more profitable employment in the ſervice of his brother and company. Having been abſent ſeveral years without ſeeing his brothers, he embraced the offer the more cheerfully, as it would give him an opportunity not only of ſeeing but of being frequently with them, as he ſuppoſed. The conſideration of this renewed all the feelings of his early days, and got the better of every other conſideration. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately left his employers without knowing what had happened to his brother, or even reflecting on the poſſibility of it, and arrived juſt in ſeaſon to be witneſs to his brother's misfortunes.—So tranſitory is every proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in life!</p>
               <p>"Being all reduced to circumſtances alike precarious, they had nothing left to comfort themſelves, or one another, but their mutual affection and brotherly love, which remained unbroken by ſeparation, or by misfortune, or by the death of their mother, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened during the progreſs of theſe events, and which was a great trial to them. But the ſtrength of their affection was ſoon to be
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:025609_0239_0FCE85CE0455AE20"/>
put to a ſevere trial another way. This trial brought forth ſome inſtances of gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, which ought to be reſcued from the moth of time, and ſhould be preſerved as an example to others.</p>
               <p>We muſt now go back and take a view of Mr. Weatherly, whom we laſt ſaw taking leave of his family for America; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his proſpects all fore cloſed he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined for the Eaſt Indies, where he hoped in a little time to retrieve his circumſtances. He alſo determined that his family ſhould not hear any thing from him, till he was able to relieve them from that poverty, and all thoſe diſtreſſes, he knew his abſence muſt have occaſioned. In the courſe of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years, during which time his family ſuppoſed him to be dead, he effected his purpoſe; and was now returned to make them rejoice in a participation of the fruits of his long abſence. No ſooner did Mr. Weatherly reach his native ſhore, than he had the unſpeakable mortification of ſeeing his eldeſt ſon in this diſgraceful ſituation of ſtrolling comedian. Tho long abſent, yet he recogniſed him by a certain mark in his forehead, which left no doubt of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſon. Rage and deſpair ſeized him, and ſuddenly leaving the place, he haſtened
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:025609_0240_0FCE86E29C849150"/>
to find his other children, for he had already been informed of the death of his wife.</p>
               <p>He ſoon found where Africa, his ſecond ſon was, who, like an affectionate child, flew to his father's arms, on hearing that he was ſtill alive, and had arrived in that part of the world. After relating ſomething of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and the ſucceſs that had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them, he lamented the unfortunate circumſtances, and as he thought, diſgraceful conduct of his eldeſt ſon, and aſſured Africa that his brother Europe ſhould be cut off from enjoying any ſhare in the wealth he had acquired; but that he ſhould immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a large proportion of it between him and his younger brother. On finding his father thus determined to diſinherit his eldeſt broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Africa was much affected, but reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thanked his father for his intended goodneſs to him. He ſaid many things by way of apology for Europe, and endeavored by every method in his power to abate his father's reſentment; and nobly added, that his affection to his brother was ſuch, that he could not think of accepting any fortune in which his brother was not to be a ſharer. Mr. Weatherly was no leſs vexed than aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed at this reply, which carried ſuch an air of ſeriouſneſs as left no room to doubt of its being his fixed determination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="unknown:025609_0241_0FCE86E41C5C1DD8"/>
The arrival of his younger brother at this juncture, was very fortunate. He had juſt arrived from ſea, and hearing of the return of his long loſt father, he flew to the place where he then was, and entered juſt as his brother was reſpectfully taking leave of his father. The ſcene was truly affecting; and Mr. Weatherly, after many expreſſions of affection for ſo fine a ſon, as he was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtile him, and after a great deal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, aſſured America, "that he ſhould inherit all his earnings, for that his brother Europe had rendered himſelf unworthy any part of his fortune, by his indiſcretion, and his other brother by his weakneſs and folly." America, with all the plainneſs and generoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of a ſeaman, plumply refuſed accepting a farthing of it unleſs his brothers were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come in for ſhares. He declared to his father that although his elder brother might have erred, yet that he had an honeſt heart and a generous diſpoſition; and that, under his circumſtances, men were liable to do thoſe things they would not juſtify in a different ſituation. There was ſomething ſo noble and frank in the manner in which America addreſſed his father, and at the ſame time he ſpoke ſo feelingly, that it produced a favorable effect upon him. Mr. Weatherly
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:025609_0242_0FCE86E68698DBA8"/>
could no longer retain any reſentment againſt an unfortunate ſon, but declared that the generous manner in which his two ſons, and eſpecially America, had behaved, evinced to him that they were worthy of his favor, and alſo that they looked upon their brother Europe as deſerving the ſame.</p>
               <p>The generous America, flew to inform his brothers of the happy change in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's temper. It is not eaſy to deſcribe the joy that this information gave them; and the honeſt ſeaman felt more than he could expreſs. Their arrival in a harmonious and brotherly ſort, at their father's lodgings, baniſhed every prejudice from his mind, and inſpired the parent's heart with lively joy; while tranſports of pleaſure filled the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Europe. Every thing being now amicably ſettled to mutual ſatisfaction, they continued to live together in proſperity, and on terms of affection and amity, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by their late misfortunes."</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXI. A ſnow ſtorm—a poor man periſhes in it—Mr. Worthy's conduct on the occaſion—a pathetic diſcourſe on charity—a poem on compaſſion and charity.</head>
               <p>THE following winter was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſevere, and proved fatal to ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ventured too far in their attempts to beat through violent ſnow ſtorms. Many people are too ventureſome in this way. It is the more dangerous, as the cold ſoon leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens thoſe powers of exertion which they at firſt poſſeſs, and their efforts to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diminiſh as the neceſſity for making them encreaſes; great care ſhould therefore be had by thoſe who are expoſed to be out at all ſeaſons. They are often admoniſhed by the fate of others. About chriſtmas, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy nine, a man belonging to the ſtate of Rhode Iſland, left Boſton after a violent ſnow ſtorm had come on; the ſnow was drift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the whole atmoſphere was ſo filled with it, that he could not ſee his way.
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:025609_0244_0FCE86ED541E44C0"/>
After ſtruggling in vain againſt the violence of the tempeſt, and in vain attempting to beat through the drifts of ſnow that were every moment encreaſing, he, together with all his cattle, periſhed on Boſton neck, and the next morning were found ſtanding in a great ſnow bank, nearly covered up. This alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtance, near ſo large a town, ſhould make thoſe very cautious who live in a more thinly ſettled country. People may be induced to run great riſques in order to ſave expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but they ſhould conſider how dearly they may pay for the experiment, either by freezing partially, and ſo being maimed, or by periſhing. The firſt alarming ſymptoms are a laſcitude or indiſpoſition to action, and a drowſineſs which inclines perſons in this ſituation to lay down under a fence or any place of defence againſt the wind or ſtorm.—Here they inſenſibly doze away into the ſleep of death! Whenever any one is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably reduced to this alarming ſituation, he ſhould keep himſelf in motion, though he make no way ahead. The firſt approach of ſleepineſs ſhould alarm, him with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of death, which muſt inevitably follow if he gives way in the leaſt to it. Inſtead of doing this, he ſhould walk back and forth in a little parade which he may make, even
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:025609_0245_0FCE86EF6DFF8B10"/>
if the ſnow is deep, often beating his hands, and otherwiſe exerting himſelf in different motions.</p>
               <p>This being the firſt winter after Mr. Blanford removed into the country, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared terrible to him; but he endeavored to make it as agreeable as poſſible by often viſiting at Mr. Worthy's. He happened to be caught there in a ſtorm of ſnow, againſt the violence of which he returned home with great difficulty. The next morning he was called upon, among others, to the relief of a family whoſe diſtreſſes he deſcribes in a pathetic manner in a letter to a friend:—"Hard by a copſe of wood, and under the covert of a raggid cliff, ſtood the hut of an induſtrious peaſant, whoſe early misfortunes, and numerous family, entailed poverty upon him. This poor man, taking his eldeſt ſon with him, went ſome diſtance into the woods in queſt of prey, to ſupply the wants of a needy family, while another lad was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to procure a little meal to make a cake. This luckleſs man wandered far from his lonely cottage before he could obtain any game. There was already ſome ſnow on the ground, which, with the encreaſing ſtorm that came on heavily towards night, made it impoſſible to follow his track back again.
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:025609_0246_0FCE86F0DD8098D8"/>
The cold, which encreaſed with the ſtorm, benumbed them ſo as to make their motions languid. They wandered about this way and the other, endeavoring to face the ſtorm, as that gave them ſome direction towards home, till the darkneſs of the night prevented their being able any longer to keep any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular courſe. They endeavored to beat againſt it without knowing which way they went, or being able to make much way ahead. Here they wallowed about half buried in the ſnow banks, exerting their weary and enfeebled limbs, to reach the wiſhed for home, while the anxious wife prepares the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt the humble roof afforded, to warm and refreſh them at their return. But, alas, how vain is all her care! While ſhe is thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for their comfort, the blood chills and grows ſtagnant in their veins! The darkneſs of the night brings on gloomy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions leſt ſome evil may have befallen her huſband and her ſon. As the evening ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, her diſtreſs riſes to half diſtraction. The little ones hang about her, and, crying, aſk a father's return—"Why don't Daddy come—where is Dickie gone?"—Often does ſhe fly to the rattling wicket to receive him welcome—as often is ſhe deceived by the trembling of the door, before the violence of the ſtorm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="unknown:025609_0247_0FCE86F75D208718"/>
In this diſtreſsful ſituation does ſhe paſs the night. The howling tempeſt without, and the more violent agitation within, formed a ſcene that baffles all deſcription. In the morning, the ſtorm being over, ſhe ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to the neareſt houſe, that her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and ſon were miſſing. Many people were ſoon out ſcouring the woods. They ſearched every place that ſeemed probable, and at laſt they found the ſon apparently juſt expiring on the ſtiffened corps of the father. It is unneceſſary to attempt a deſcription of the poor woman's diſtreſs on this occaſion; it was ſuch as imagination may figure to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the natural effect of ſo dreadful a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe! A circumſtance that relieved her in ſome meaſure, from the firſt ſhock, was, that her ſon, who was in the dozing ſtate already mentioned as a prelude to death, ſoon revived, on proper applications, ſo as to give hope of his recovery. It was on this occaſion that my friend Worthy diſcovered a generoſity, and delicacy of mind, that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates true greatneſs of ſoul, and convinces me that not only many a philoſopher, but many a divine, and many a ſaint, follows the plough. He addreſſed the widow in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of tenderneſs and ſympathy; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her that ſhe might make herſelf eaſy
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:025609_0248_0FCE86FA58EC95B0"/>
with regard to a preſent ſupply for her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and that he would cauſe her ſon to be tranſported to his own houſe, where every thing ſhould be done to effect a total reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the injured parts. The funeral of the unhappy victim, which was made at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expenſe, principally by Mr. Worthy's influence, was attended with great ſolemnity. A ſermon was given on the occaſion by Mr. Villars. It was ſhort, but pertinent and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic. It was on this occaſion, that this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and truly pious clergyman, diſplayed with great force of language and warmth of expreſſion, the vanity of the preſent ſtate, and its liableneſs to diſappoint all our hopes and expectations; the frailty of man, and the numberleſs accidents to which he is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. From a conſideration of the vanity and tranſitory nature of all ſublunary things, he urged the importance of ſecuring an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in a better ſtate, and dwelt on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation that the proſpect of ſuch a ſtate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to mourners. On this part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he could dwell with propriety, for the poor man who had fallen before the piercing cold, though very poor, had a regard for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and whenever he could, he went to public worſhip, though at the diſtance of ſeveral miles. This rendered him happier
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:025609_0249_0FCE86FC3B570E28"/>
while he lived, and rendered him fitter for the ſudden death that had overtaken him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Villars alſo took occaſion to explain and recommend charity to the poor, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the diſtreſſed, as a great chriſtian duty, without which all pretenſions to religion were vain and fooliſh. "Men, ſaid he, may appear to be devout, and may talk religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly without expenſe; but the calls of charity bring them to the teſt, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently decide the queſtion, whether God or the world, duty or intereſt, preponderates." Mr. Villars was accuſtomed to view the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of his fellow creatures with great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and humanity, and to relieve the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of thoſe who fell within his reach, as far as his own means would allow. He could therefore with good grace recommend to his hearers to "diffuſe a gleam of cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over the ſufferings of the ſolitary widow, and the needy fatherleſs, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate their diſtreſsful condition, by ſuch neceſſaries as they could ſpare. How hard, ſaid he, is the lot of the poor? How pitiable the ſtate of our fellow creatures, when deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of every circumſtance that can allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that can mitigate the ſevere pangs of affliction, and afford common neceſſaries to the calls of a ſurrounding, dependent family?
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:025609_0250_0FCE87029E4E3590"/>
How indiſpenſible then is the obligation to exert ourſelves in aſſiſting our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to render life at leaſt ſupportable?" This pathetic addreſs had a good effect on the humane, if not on the moral feelings of the audience. The diſtreſſed family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great relief, and places were provided for ſeveral of the children. Mrs. Worthy took one of thoſe children to bring up, and highly applauded the cheerfulneſs of her children, particularly of her daughters, in parting with ſome articles of their own clothing for the poor girls who were depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their father.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXII. Mr. Worthy's ideas of economy—maxims concerning it—recommended and exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dr. Franklin—Fable of Avarice and Liberality.</head>
               <p>"LET nothing be loſt," was a mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and conſtant injunction with Mr. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. "It is is an old ſaying, that a penny ſaved, is as good as a penny earned." "I will venture to affirm, Mr. Worthy would ſay, it is better; for the ſame economy that teaches how to ſave a penny, will teach us alſo to make the beſt, and moſt advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſe of it." This ſaving the effects of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry from the devouring jaws of careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſquandering, does not imply the leaſt degree of parſimony or ſtingineſs; but the moſt prudent uſe and application of what we have acquired. "In moſt of our houſes, ſaid Mr. Worthy to Mr. Blanford, when both their families were preſent, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough loſt, and thrown away, of ſome one article, which if it were ſaved with care, might purchaſe ſome other uſeful article for
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:025609_0253_0FCE8708A19CC068"/>
the family. I will inſtance, ſaid he, in that of paper. I have no doubt but every fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might ſupply itſelf with paper every year for neceſſary uſes, from the rags which are ſwept out of doors and loſt, or thrown into the fire and burnt." Here one of the Miſs Blanfords bluſhed like crimſon, for ſhe had juſt thrown a handful of linen ſhreds into the fire. Mr. Worthy obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bluſh, relieved her, and diverted them all with the ſtory of Dr. Franklin's whiſtle.—"I recollect, ſaid he, the ſtory of Dr. Franklin, who when he was a ſmall boy, had his pockets filled with coppers on a holiday. Poſſeſſed of this treaſure, he ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied forth to a toy ſhop to part with his cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and pleaſe his fancy. Being charmed with the ſound of a whiſtle, in the hands of a boy he met on the way, he voluntarily offered all his money for one. Returning home, he went whiſtling about houſe, to the great annoyance of all the family, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the bargain, told him he had given four times as much for it as it was worth. This put him in mind of what good things he might have bought with the money he had loſt. They laughed at him ſo much that he cried for vexation; and the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on what he had needleſsly loſt, gave
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:025609_0254_0FCE870CDEFCEC20"/>
him more pain than the whiſtle gave him pleaſure. This want of economy, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was of great uſe to him afterwards, for when he was tempted to buy ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary thing, he would ſay to himſelf "Dont give too much for the whiſtle," and ſo he ſaved his money; and when he came on the ſtage and obſerved the conduct of others, he ſaw many giving too much for their whiſtles. When, on the other hand, he ſaw a man giving up every kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable living, all the pleaſure of doing good to others, all the eſteem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of friendſhip, for the ſake of accumulating wealth; or, on the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſacrificing health, fortune, and whatever is valuable in life, to pleaſure, he would ſay, "Such men pay too dear for their whiſtles." The ſtory amuſed the company, and reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſs Blanford from the confuſion of mind into which the incident had thrown her; but it afforded a very inſtructive leſſon ever afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanford replied, "that he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed economy as holding a middle rank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween avarice and prodigality; and that though it had no great brilliancy, and is by many conſidered as a tame indifferent quality,
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:025609_0255_0FCE870F89D05C10"/>
yet that it is the way to wealth, and has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the pens of ſome of the ableſt writers. Dr. Franklin, whoſe name will long live an honor to his country, employed many of his hours, even when occupied with national politics, in ſtudying maxims of prudence and economy. Thoſe ſubjects indeed occupy a large proportion of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous writings. They are on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of unſpeakably greater advantage to the world than if he had always ſoared in the higher regions of ſcience. Writings which are on a level with the public mind, are moſt extenſively uſeful. He therefore, who advances the moſt maxims and beſt ſuited to the exigencies of ſociety, does the moſt benefit with his pen. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, continued Mr. Blanford, that great part of the miſeries of mankind are brought upon themſelves by the falſe eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate they have made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whiſtles."</p>
               <p>Mr. Worthy was as careful to ſave by economy as to acquire by induſtry. This gave him a great advantage over many who in their hurry about ſomethings forget many others, and ſo bring little to paſs. They may be induſtrious in gathering, but
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:025609_0256_0FCE87105EA5A078"/>
kick over with their feet what their hands have gathered; while they are doing one thing, they undo another, and in their hurry bring nothing to paſs. They run here and there, do a little of one thing, and a little of another, keep themſelves in a fret, their houſe in a tumult, and at laſt leave every thing at ſixes and ſevens. Mr. Worthy often ſaid of ſuch people, that they "let out at the ſpile what they put in at the bung." He was never idle, and ſeldom in a hurry. His buſineſs was well planned, and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed. He laid out no more than could be finiſhed in ſeaſon; never deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he had done by eagerneſs to do more than could be effected. He attended minutely to his affairs, and when the day cloſed he diſmiſſed his cares with it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happened, he was ſerene and temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. He was thankful for proſperity; but never diſcompoſed by croſs accidents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had taken proper care to guard againſt them. He never ſuffered himſelf to be out of humor for what could not be prevented, nor anxious about events that were beyond the reach of human control. He was ſucceſsful in his buſineſs becauſe he obſerved method, and by his economy he
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:025609_0257_0FCE8711D8074E60"/>
ſaved an ample portion for the poor, whoſe bleſſing, every day came upon him.</p>
               <p>The following fable confirms Mr. Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's definition of economy, and ſhows it to ſtand on a middle line between ſolicitude and profuſeneſs. "In old time, when ſome grew rich and heaped up great ſtores, while others ſquandered away what they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, there lived by the ſide of a great field one of thoſe beings who never think of any thing but hoarding up great ſtores of goods, and of having their coffers filled with gold. His name was <hi>Avarice.</hi> He owned all that vaſt field which deſcended quite to the river on the ſouth and extended to the mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous country to the weſt. His granaries merely groaned under the oppreſſion of his vaſt crops. He better knew how to collect than to improve. <hi>Care</hi> ſeized his breaſt, and deprived him of the happineſs he might otherwiſe have enjoyed.</p>
               <p>Not far from him, on the ſummit of a beautiful riſe, lived a maiden of uncommon beauty, in the bloom of youth. Her name was <hi>Liberality.</hi> Mild and gentle in her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſhe was eaſily wrought upon by the appearance of want or diſtreſs in others. Her houſe was the ſeat of hoſpitality. Hither reſorted people of all claſſes. Here
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:025609_0258_0FCE8713DD6FACD0"/>
the weary pilgrim would be ſure to find ſhelter and reſt. Her doors were open to all who were paſſing, and the beſt the houſe afforded was brought forth and ſet before them. She profuſely ſcattered the bleſſings of her hand, and multitudes felt the effect of her generoſity. But the extent of her fortune, though very great, was not equal to the extent of her generoſity. Sad experience taught her that the objects of charity and of hoſpitality ſhould not be univerſal, but ſelected with care; for that inſtead of entertaining angels by an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate reception of all, ſhe might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entertain harpies, and oftentimes give to the undeſerving. This diſcovery was made too late to recover her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Her fortune was gone, and with that her friends. As ſhe ſat one day reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on herſelf for the incautious manner in which ſhe had parted with her intereſt, Avarice called to upbraid her for the folly of which ſhe had been guilty. But when he entered the room where ſhe was ſetting alone and ſolitary, he was ſtruck with the beauty of her form, the gracefulneſs of her mein, and the placid amiableneſs of mind ſhining in her countenance. Inſtead of blaming, he propoſed marriage to her, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:025609_0259_0FCE8719E3CF2510"/>
her that he had more than he knew what to do with, and could not enjoy it alone. She modeſtly conſented, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his allowing her a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of it to be at her own diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The conditions ſettled, the nuptials were celebrated with joy and feſtivity; and they go on joyfully together. Avarice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to taſte the pleaſures of generoſity; and Liberality to learn ſome of the caution of Avarice. The conſequence of this marriage was the birth of a beautiful little daughter in due time. It was, as the poet ſays,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>"A little maid of matchleſs worth.</l>
                  <l>Her face was mix'd of care and glee,</l>
                  <l>They chriſtened her ECONOMY!</l>
                  <l>And ſtil'd her fair diſcretion's queen,</l>
                  <l>The miſtreſs of the golden mean.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now LIBERALITY confin'd,</l>
                  <l>Is perfect eaſy in her mind;</l>
                  <l>She loves to give, yet knows to ſpare,</l>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIII. This chapter concludes the hiſtory of Mr. Worthy.</head>
               <p>THOUGH Mr. Worthy followed his own maxims of economy, yet he never denied himſelf any of the neceſſaries, nor even the decent conveniences of life, that were within the compaſs of his means; and while he taught his ſons the maxims of fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and prudence, which regulated his own conduct, his wife inſtructed her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the ſame art of making the moſt of every thing. The knowledge of this art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the more neceſſary for them, as they were now advancing towards that ſtate wherein they would have occaſion every day to practice it for themſelves. There is no one quality that unites ſo many uſeful and neceſſary properties in the female character as this. It was on account of Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy's eldeſt daughter poſſeſſing this knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge to a high degree, that Mr. and Mrs. Blanford highly eſteemed her. Previous to their removing to the farm where they now
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:025609_0261_0FCE871D912B37C8"/>
reſided, their ſon George had conceived a ſtrong inclination for a ſeafaring life. He was abſent at the time of their removal, and continued abſent for ſome time afterwards. He was attended by a variety of fortunes, having been ſeveral times caſt away; and though more fortunate at others, yet he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo much that on his return, he was glad to quit the ſeas, and retire with his father on the farm. He ſoon became remarkably contented and ſatisfied with his ſituation, conſidering he had been ſo much abroad. He began to enter into all the pleaſures of their little circle of friends. Though their ſituation was rural, and their enjoyments of a nature ſuited to the country, he partook of them with encreaſing cheerfulneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. He ſcarcely knew the cauſe of his growing attachment to a ſcene, ſo different from any thing to which he had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, till he ſound his affections fixed on Mr. Worthy's eldeſt daughter. He was enam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored with her, not merely on account of the beauty of her perſon, though that was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but on account of the amiableneſs of her diſpoſition, the ſprightlineſs and vivacity of her mind, and the excellent manner in which ſhe had been educated. The affair was communicated to her parents, and their
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:025609_0262_0FCE8720C51DDC38"/>
permiſſion to viſit Miſs Worthy was aſked. There appeared no other objection to the young gentleman's propoſal, than that his education had been ſo different from her's. Mr. Worthy feared that his habits in the firſt part of life would be injurious to him in the country, and as a farmer. This difficulty, however, was leſſening every day, by his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing love of a country life. The affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was mutual between young Mr. Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and Miſs Dorcas Worthy, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their parents was obtained. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to their being married, he was under the neceſſity of making a voyage to the Weſt Indies to collect ſome debts, which he had left in bad hands, who had ſeveral times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him about payment. He ſet ſail for Martinico, where he completed his buſineſs, after a detention of ſeveral months, and a great deal of perplexity, and embarked for home in the firſt veſſel bound to his native town. Several other paſſengers were on board the ſame veſſel, among whom were an Engliſh lady and her only daughter, a young lady of very elegant accompliſhments. The agreeable company on board the veſſel, and the pleaſing proſpect of being ſoon reſtored to his beloved Dorcas, together with a fine wind, lightened his ſpirits, and made the
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:025609_0263_0FCE8722EF121450"/>
time he had been abſent, appear now but very ſhort. They had nearly gained their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, when there came on a violent ſtorm, which continued for ſome time. They were driven back again many leagues, and at laſt, by the violence of the wind, they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. It was on this occaſion that young Mr. Blanford diſcovered great fortitude and generoſity. In the confuſion of affairs, when each one ſeemed abſorbed in the care of himſelf, the two ladies and their waiting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were left below in the cabin, from whence Mr. Blanford made an attempt, at the riſque of his own life, to reſcue them. In this attempt he was ſo happy as to be ſucceſsful, though Mrs. Farley, the mother of the young lady, was conſiderably injured in being pulled out of the cabin. They all remained on the ſide of the veſſel for ſeveral hours, toſſed about by the boiſterous waves. At length the maſts gave way, and the deck being cleared of all incumbrances, the veſſel righted up. They were now a mere wreck, floating about at the mercy of the wind and waves. In this diſtreſsful ſituation, they continued more than fifty hours, when they diſcovered a ſhip to which they made ſigns of diſtreſs. Theſe being at length diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the people on board the ſhip, the
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:025609_0264_0FCE872561855068"/>
Captain, who was a humane man, ran directly down for them, and took them all on board his own ſhip, with every thing he could get from the wreck. Mr. Blanford was ſo fortunate as to ſave his cheſt, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the principal part of the intereſt he had on board. The ſhip was bound to Halifax, where they all arrived ſafe in about twelve days. Young Mr. Blanford having been gone much longer than his friends expected, and hearing nothing of him, they grew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely uneaſy about him. Mr. Blanford, who knew better about the nature of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs he went upon than the reſt of the friends, was leſs uneaſy about his ſon. But a letter from a friend, informing that his ſon had ſailed from the Weſt Indies ſome time ſince, gave him great alarm. He ſet out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for—, where he made every inquiry after intelligence about his ſon, but could gain no more than that he had ſailed a number of weeks before, but had been heard nothing of ſince. In theſe diſtreſsful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, with a heart ready to burſt with grief, Mr. Blanford was about returning home with the melancholy probability that his ſon was buried in a watery grave. In the morning, when he was going out of town, he met an old acquaintance who informed
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:025609_0265_0FCE8726E7F6F118"/>
him that a veſſel had juſt arrived from Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax with ſome paſſengers on board, who, as he was informed, had been taken from a wreck at ſea. Mr. Blanford went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to make inquiry, when to his joy and ſurpriſe, the firſt perſon he met coming from the ſhip, was his loſt ſon. I need not attempt to deſcribe the mutual happineſs of this meeting, nor the tide of joy which aroſe in the family on their arrival home, after ſixteen months abſence. During this long abſence, and the fears that agitated her mind with regard to his ſafety, Miſs Worthy behaved with a modeſty becoming her ſex; but was not able wholly to conceal the agitation of her mind. His unexpected arrival at a time when the apprehenſions of his being loſt were moſt lively, was an incident too mighty for her. Immediately on his arrival at his father's, he flew to relieve her of thoſe apprehenſions.—It was too much for her—the tide roſe too high—ſhe fainted at the ſight of ſo unexpected a viſitant, but was ſoon recovered. Thoſe incidents of fortune which had tried the ſincerity of their mutual affections, ſerved but to ſtrengthen their attachment to each other; and on the next new year's eve, their nuptials were celebrated in preſence of a number of their friends, who

gave every teſtimony of their mutual joy and ſatiſfaction.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Worthy, whoſe chief hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs it had been to ſee their children tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to good courſes, rewarding all their care by behaving well, and making themſelves eſteemed and beloved, now enjoyed the fruit of all their care and attention in ſeeing them forming good connexions, and being able to acquit themſelves therein with honor and advantage. Young Mr. Blanford, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out in life with the advantage of a ſmall farm given him by his father, and the ſtill greater advantage of a wife, who was perfect miſtreſs of the buſineſs of her department, ſoon began to flouriſh as a farmer, and in proceſs of time, became a wealthy farmer, and a reſpectable citizen. This connexion rendered the intercourſe between the two families, more frequent and agreeable. It was not interrupted by thoſe jealouſies and competitions which ſometimes ariſe between neighbors, and which excite envyings, ſtrife and contentions. Their evenings, which were frequently ſpent together, were never contaminated by foul breath of ſcandal and evil ſpeaking of others, as is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the caſe; but in uſeful and pleaſant converſation—in obſervations on the gradual
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:025609_0267_0FCE872D9F066DB8"/>
progreſs of their ſettlements, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of agriculture—how the howling ſwamp was converted into a pleaſing and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meadow, and the rough ridge into a fine fruitful field. While the jocund diſcourſe goes round, the young people participate in the pleaſure which their parents ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in recounting their toils, and the ſucceſs attending them; and in turn, indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in youthful mirth. Mrs. Worthy would mix with them in their amuſing ſcenes in ſo graceful a manner, that ſhe ſeemed to be on a footing with them, and even to give life to their amuſements, without letting down her dignity, or loſing a proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over their minds, ſo as to reſtrain them from every exceſs.</p>
               <p>This intimacy between the families was productive of another effect, which was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thought of at firſt, as the parties were quite young; but it was not long concealed from their parents, that Mr. Worthy's eldeſt ſon, Henry Smith, was ſtrongly attached to Miſs Theodoſia Blanford. Their youthful hearts were united by a bond too ſtrong to be broken, and their marriage was celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few months after the birth of a ſecond child, to young Mr. Blanford. This being a ſon, it was the occaſion of great joy to all their friends.</p>

Mr. Worthy, who now ſaw his children ſettling about him, conceived it proper to make a will, that no difficulty might ariſe to alienate the affections of his children from each other after his deceaſe. In his will he made an equal diſtribution of his intereſt among all his children, and charged each one with whatever he gave them at their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus, "ſetting his houſe in order, as he often expreſſed it, that he might be ſo far ready to receive his maſter's call." Mr. Worthy was much employed in offices in the town, wherein he acquitted himſelf much to his honor and their benefit; for he was truly a benevolent man and ſtudied the good of others. He modeſtly declined all public employment, and public offices. To have the beſt cultivated farm, and be conſidered in the firſt rank of the primary occupation—to lighten the labors of his wife, and render her comfortable and happy—to have the beſt regulated family, and to ſee his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren well ſettled, virtuous and happy, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the effects of his care in the fruits of their own induſtry, formed the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his ambition, and engaged his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form attention.—Thankful to God for the portion of good allotted him, he envied no man's proſperity.—Satisfied with his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:025609_0269_0FCE8733A20D8398"/>
and reſigned to the will of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, he only wiſhed to live to ſee his children poſſeſſed of the ſame temper, and enjoying the bleſſings of health, a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and well ſettled on farms which their own induſtry might bring to a good ſtate of cultivation—the moſt fortunate ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation they could be placed in!—Who can be happier than an independent American farmer, under the ſmiles of his heavenly patron, and the auſpices of a government ariſing out of the majeſty of the people, and ſhedding its bleſſings over a peaceful ſoil?—That the agricultural part of this great community, may long, long enjoy theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, is the moſt ardent wiſh and humble ſupplication of THE FARMER'S FRIEND.</p>
               <l>May the long race of virtuous heirs ſucceed</l>
               <l>Lords of the ſoil, to beautify thoſe ſcenes;</l>
               <l>But chiefly to glad the heart of induſtry,</l>
               <l>And feel the bleſſings ſeven fold return'd,</l>
               <l>In plenteous harveſt and domeſtic peace.</l>
