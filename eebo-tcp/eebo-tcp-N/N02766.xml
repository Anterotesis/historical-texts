            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great is your Practice both in Town and Country, and ſuch is your Care and Tho't of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, that I believe you have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any time to Read D—s' <hi>Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the</hi> Inoculation <hi>of the</hi> Small-Pox: You will therefore take it not amiſs, if I ſave you the labour of reading that injudicious Piece, by giving you this Evening ſome Stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon it.</p>
            <p>IT ſurprized me to find one, who is reputed a Scholar, and values himſelf upon a Degree which he little deſerves, committing ſeveral manifeſt <hi>Grammatical Blunders</hi> in a Sheet or two: And yet if he had reſerved them all for the <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> I ſhould have forgiven them; but I can by no means excuſe <hi>any one in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>: Methinks he might, in honour to his Degree and Character, have afforded good Mr. JEKYLL his Patron good ſenſe for a Quarter of a Sheet without any Error at all; but it
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003296_0003_0FF03EBCEAC58620"/>ſeems he has not; whether it proceeded from an unhappy Ignorance, or a noble Negligence one may eaſily conjecture: <hi>To ſpeak in Medical</hi> Terms, ſays he, <hi>Integrity ſeems to be in the</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <hi>of your Family.</hi> He may call you <hi>a Quack,</hi> if he pleaſes; but I am ſure he is a <hi>Blunderbuſs</hi> to make <hi>the Conſtitution</hi> of Mr. JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KYL's Family <hi>Medical Terms.</hi> And by the way, here, he ſeems to me to be as much out in point of <hi>Decency,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n <hi>Grammar</hi>: For I cannot but think it a great, invidious and inexcuſable Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in him, when he mentions Mr. JEKYL's Family and its <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> and applauds his <hi>Uncle,</hi> to overlook his Reverend <hi>Father,</hi> who was an Eminent Clergyman, and as I have been inform'd from undoubted Authorities, was highly eſteemed for his <hi>Probity, Integrity</hi> and many more Virtues.</p>
            <p>THERE are one or two conſiderable Errors more of his in the <hi>Dedication,</hi> and diverſe <hi>groſs</hi> ones in the <hi>Diſſertation</hi>; but I ſhall not ſtay to expoſe them; leſt You, and others, ſhould think I regard his <hi>Words</hi> more than his <hi>Meaning</hi> and his <hi>Sounds</hi> rather than his <hi>Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE I come to what immediately relates to the Controverſy <hi>concerning Inoculation</hi>; I muſt inform You, that our Author ſays in his Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>With out Paſſion or Prejudice — I ſhall impartially relate the Hiſtory,</hi> &amp;c. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this good Promiſe, in his Book he ſhews his old <hi>Paſſion &amp; Prejudice</hi> againſt You, &amp; your excellent Friend the late Doctor MATHER.</p>
            <p>IN pag. 10. he ſays, he <hi>can ſeldome have recourſe to</hi> your <hi>Accounts</hi>; I expected his Reaſon would
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003296_0004_0FF03EBF34FC50D8"/>be, becauſe they were ſcarce here when he wrote his Diſſertation; but his Reaſon is, <hi>becauſe</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>of their being ſo jejune, lame, ſuſpected, and only in the nature of a Quack Bill.</hi> If this be a good Reaſon; many, and I in particular, <hi>can ſeldom have recourſe</hi> to his inſipid Pamplet: For many things are <hi>jejune and lame</hi> in it, I <hi>ſuſpect</hi> ſeveral things, and I verily believe any <hi>Quack</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> would, with the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he has had, produce as good a Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. And as for your part, you need not regard his Character of <hi>your Account</hi> of Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation here, when it has been approved by Dr. JURIN the late Secretary of the Royal Society, and many other Perſons of Learning and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; and when (notwithſtanding he calls your <hi>Dedication</hi> of it to the Princeſs of WALES <hi>aſſuming</hi>) it met with a kinder Reception from her Royal Highneſs, and a more favourable Entertainment from all the wiſe and impartial, than his <hi>Diſſertation</hi> ever ought to or will have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men of Underſtanding, or his <hi>Dedication</hi> from his Patron. And ſo much concerning your Book.</p>
            <p>AS to you your ſelf he tells us, that when your <hi>Buſineſs ran low</hi> here, you went for LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON, <hi>and expected under the Character of an</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Inoculator, <hi>a profitable Encouragement there, but was entirely diſappointed,</hi> pag. 7. This is an idle ſurmiſe, and great Untruth of his; for you went not to LONDON under that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he tells of; nor, as you have informed me, would you inoculate there; tho' you were <hi>often</hi> preſſed and encouraged to it.</p>
            <p>BUT he is not content with a rude Uſage of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003296_0005_0FF03EC0B89EA8D0"/>you in his <hi>Diſſertation</hi>; He muſt alſo tell his Patron, that you are a Man of <hi>no Literature and habitual Raſhneſs.</hi> I muſt confeſs, that I took upon you to be as well acquainted with your Buſineſs as the <hi>Graduated Doctor</hi>: You ſeem, from what I can learn, as well as he, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>the Theory of Diſeaſes</hi>; and as to the <hi>Curing</hi> of them, I believe every Practitioner in <hi>Phyſick</hi> at BOSTON will give you the Preference. Nor do I think any of them will blame you for <hi>the habitual Raſhneſs,</hi> which he charges you with, ſo much as they do and will him for his <hi>actual Raſhneſs</hi> in many Inſtances, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Regard to his Excellency our late Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.— <hi>Nec te, improbe, Saltem—Terruit Exempl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> Phaeton. I have now done with you, Doctor, but not with <hi>D—s</hi>; nor ſhall I, on his Account, leave off my Letter this good while.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D—s</hi> has but <hi>few words and ſpiteful</hi> of Dr. MATHER; but it had been better for him to have ſaid nothing at all than to traduce and leſſen the Character of that great Man: He might well think every good Man would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn every <hi>diſgraceful word</hi> given out concerning that Pious &amp; Learned Gentleman, &amp; at the ſame time abhor <hi>the Perſon</hi> who ſpeaks or writes it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not dwell on his ſaying the Doctor had TIMONIUS' and PYLARINUS's Accounts <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptiouſly,</hi> which is a paltry word, and has an ill ſound. What does the Blade mean by it? Would he make us believe the Doctor <hi>Stole</hi> the Book from ſome-body he lent it to, that ſo he might have <hi>the Honour of the new fangled Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> p. 2. Yes, ſo his words plainly import:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003296_0006_0FF03EC403558BD0"/>But ſuch an Inſinuation, (beſides the <hi>weakneſs</hi> he betrays in it; inaſmuch as he (imagining the aforeſaid Accounts, publiſhed to the World to be his <hi>private Property)</hi> ſuppoſes no one, but <hi>he,</hi> had any Right to know the Purport of them) it conveys alſo in it a <hi>notorious Falſity</hi>; and therefore tends to the Diſgrace of the <hi>Accuſer,</hi> and is no Diſparagement to the <hi>Deceaſed.</hi>—When the Doctor was alive, he tho't it a <hi>Praiſe and an Honour</hi> to be <hi>Diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and inſulted by ſuch Miſcreants as <hi>D—s</hi>: and if he be <hi>maletreated</hi> now by ſuch, it is ſtill a Glory to him.</p>
            <p>BUT I can by no means put up his 8th page: In that he ſays, <hi>The beſt of men have ſome Foible, and that of Dr.</hi> MATHER'<hi>s was</hi> Credulity. How natural is it to retort here, that <hi>the worſt of men</hi> have <hi>many Foibles</hi>; and thoſe of Dr. <hi>D—s</hi> ſeem to be <hi>Incredulity, Malice and Ill-nature.</hi> But ſuppoſe one ſhould deny <hi>Credulity</hi> to be the Doctor's <hi>Foible</hi>; the Inſtances he has bro't to prove it, in the aforeſaid Page, will never do it: For ſeveral of the Matters of Fact there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are indiſputably true, as there are many in BOSTON who can teſtify. <hi>D—s</hi> indeed ſays, <hi>that allowing ſuch bold Aſſertions without diſproving them, would be leading Mankind into a Snare.</hi> Why then did not he, firſt of all, <hi>diſprove</hi> 'em, and then adviſe Mankind, as thoughtleſs Birds, to avoid <hi>the Snare</hi>? Surely he was unwiſe that he did not at large demonſtrate, that when Dr. MATHER ſaid he <hi>never knew</hi> Bliſtering <hi>miſs of ſaving Life in the Small Pox,</hi> &amp;c. He did <hi>know</hi> that it had <hi>miſſed,</hi> He miſtook or He lied. If
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003296_0007_0FF03EC5CFB462C0"/>he had done ſo in this particular, and ſo in the reſt, he would have <hi>diſproved</hi> all the Doctor's Aſſertions in his Letters to the Royal Society. But after all, (if thoſe Stories or Accounts were Miſtakes,) they were undoubtedly the real Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Doctor; (as well as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;) and for <hi>D—s</hi> to treat his Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (which men of the greateſt Characters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad receiv'd with Deference and Reſpect) with ſuch Inſolence and Rudeneſs, it proves him unworthy the Nation from which he boaſts Original, and undeſerving of any Eſteem or Practice in the <hi>American</hi> Regions.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not run into any long Animadverſions on Dr. BRADY of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> for ſaying (as <hi>D—s</hi> quotes him, p. 7.) <hi>What wretched work the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> (h. e. Dr. MATHER) <hi>makes in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts</hi>? It was ridiculous in him to ſay ſo, unleſs he <hi>knew</hi> and could <hi>prove</hi> (which he could not) his <hi>Accounts</hi> to be <hi>wretched</hi>; and it was <hi>wretched Folly</hi> in <hi>D—s</hi> to produce his Scrible for nothing; unleſs indeed it might ſooth him in his Misfortune, of being the Doctors Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and <hi>Accuſer,</hi> to find one (as there now and then has happen'd ſuch an one) who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the Doctor as well as he. But I ſhall not inſiſt here.</p>
            <p>NOR ſhall I add any thing further in Favour of the Doctor, but that I would have <hi>D—s</hi> know, if his <hi>Credulity</hi> was ever ſo great in other things; he was not ſo <hi>credulous</hi> as to believe him endued with <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Wit,</hi> with <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> with <hi>Civility</hi> or <hi>Manners</hi>; and I find a conſiderable part of the Town in this of the ſame Opinion with the Doctor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003296_0008_0FEFDB588282F1C0"/>I ſaid, I would add nothing further; but I cannot help ſubjoining, that if <hi>D—s,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame raſh and illjudging <hi>Conſtitution</hi> (he will forgive the <hi>Medical Terms</hi>) with him, ſhall dare to attack the Name and Reputation of the Doctor, he and they ſhall know, there are ſome who will always riſe in his Defence to their Confuſion.</p>
            <p>AND now for <hi>Inoculation</hi>! Without any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and uſeleſs Remarks, which would ſwell my Letter to a Volumn, let us come to the Merits of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>AND here, at the ſame Time that I am fluſh'd with Joy to find how frankly <hi>D—s</hi> owns that Dr. MEAD, Sir HANS SLOANE &amp; PITCAIRN his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, all celebrated Phyſicians, <hi>countenanced and favoured</hi> the Practice; (tho' by the way this looks as if they had <hi>Credulity</hi> as well as Dr. MATHER) I am fill'd with ſorrow that I have not one of thoſe Gentlemen's Books by me, nor any one of the other Treatiſes, out of which <hi>D—s</hi> has ſelected Paſſages; ſo that I cannot tell whether he has quoted them exactly or no: For my part my <hi>Credulity</hi> ſhall run ſo far as to allow it.</p>
            <p>GRANTING then that all his Quotations are juſt and fair; let us Examine the ſeveral Heads he has offer'd, under which he has collected <hi>the Hiſtories of Facts,</hi> as he calls them, from Dr. NETTLETON, Mr. MAITLAND and others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. FROM NETTLETON and MAITLAND he ſays and ſhows, that <hi>ſome receive not the Diſtemper at all.</hi> And what then? <hi>Some receive not the Diſtemper at all</hi> in the natural Way, when they are ſurrounded on every ſide with it: Perhaps
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003296_0009_0FF03ECBEC032E70"/>there may be no proper <hi>Pabulum</hi> in their Bodies for it to prey on. Why then ſhould this be accounted an Objection againſt <hi>Inoculation</hi>? For how is it likely or poſſible that it ſhould take Effect, when the <hi>Fluids</hi> are not in a Capacity to receive it? But granting they were, and allowing that the Operation had no ſuch Effect as to procure the Diſtemper; ſtill thoſe who are Inoculated are not a whit the worſe for it: Nay, I have Reaſon to think ſome have fared the <hi>better</hi> for it. The Reverend Mr. <hi>W—</hi> now living at <hi>Roxbury,</hi> on whom it <hi>did not take place,</hi> (as <hi>D—s</hi> beautifully tranſlates a Paſſage in PYLARINUS) has enjoyed his Health <hi>ſince</hi> he was inoculated much better than <hi>before</hi>; and he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes it, in part, to his <hi>Inciſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. HE remarks, from his Author Mr. MAIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND that <hi>ſome had only Eruptive Fevers</hi>: I ſuppoſe, he means reſulting from <hi>Inoculation,</hi> or he has no meaning at all. But who will be diſſwaded from <hi>Inoculation</hi> if there really were two or three ſuch Inſtances? Pray, Doctor BOYLSTON, when you ſee <hi>D—s</hi> ask him, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe <hi>Eruptive Fevers</hi> are the <hi>natural</hi> and genuine <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Inoculation,</hi> or whether (to uſe a word or two of his) they ariſe only from ſome <hi>accidental Contagition</hi>? If he ſays <hi>the former,</hi> you can eaſily prove the contrary by numerous witneſſes and inconteſtible: For who among your inoculated Patients has had this <hi>eruptive Fever</hi>? Be ſo kind as to tell him or me, if <hi>any one</hi> has. But if he ſays <hi>the latter,</hi> it had been better for him to have laid aſide his <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abetical Pen,</hi> than permit its Dropping to ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003296_0010_0FF03ECFE85FE448"/>
3. HE takes notice from Dr. NETTLETON, that <hi>others from</hi> Inoculation <hi>have the Small-Pox to ſo</hi> ſmall a Degree <hi>as to admit of</hi> Doubt. Dr. NETTLETON may ſay, that <hi>in three of</hi> his <hi>Patients</hi> the Eruptions <hi>were ſo imperfect as to leave</hi> him in Doubt: But then, as I remember, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where obſerves, that his <hi>Doubts</hi> were diſſipated at their Recovery; for then they went any where, regardleſs of the Contagion and invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: And if others fare in the ſame Manner, where will be the Diſadvantage to <hi>Inoculation</hi> or thoſe who receive it? Sure I am this looks ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a <hi>Proof</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of <hi>Inoculation</hi> than any <hi>Objection</hi> againſt it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>OTHERS have the worſt Sort.</hi> For Peace ſake, I am ready to allow <hi>D—s</hi> and his Friends this; but he will allow me to ſay <hi>modeſtly</hi> with PYLARINUS, <hi>they moſt</hi> frequently <hi>have the</hi> diſtinct <hi>Sort.</hi> Here <hi>D—s</hi> may learnedly comment on <hi>moſt frequently,</hi> (as in pag. 11.) h. e. <hi>not always</hi> ſo. And I muſt confeſs, it is <hi>not always</hi> ſo, that thoſe who are <hi>inoculated</hi> have the <hi>diſtinct and beſt</hi> Sort. It would be cenſur'd as unfair here, if I ſhould ſay that ſuch <hi>may have received the</hi> Small-Pox <hi>before</hi> Inoculation; but is it not equally unjuſt to lay either the <hi>coheerent</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent</hi> Kind to <hi>Inoculation</hi>? It is certainly as abſurd, at leaſt, to ſay, that even in Times of <hi>General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> none may have taken the Deſtemper <hi>before</hi> they have been <hi>inoculated</hi>; as it is unfair to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſuch infected <hi>before Inoculation</hi> who have it very bad: So that under this Head the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Parties may ſhake hands. But for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſake, I ſhould be willing to allow that ſome
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003296_0011_0FF03ED16B0B8FD0"/>who have receiv'd the Small-Pox by <hi>Inciſions,</hi> have yet been very full of <hi>Pocks,</hi> and even of the <hi>confluent Kind</hi>; but then they are very <hi>few</hi> in Compariſon with thoſe who have a <hi>benign Sort and favourable Symptoms,</hi> as all who are not blind, or perverſely wilful and illnatur'd, may See. Even the dull, the heavy-ey'd, the ſleepy <hi>D—s</hi> himſelf can perceive it, and dares acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege it in pag. 25. and 26.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>SOME have died of it.</hi> I am free to grant it, to oblige him, (who never obliged any body nor favoured any Thing, unleſs for his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, viz.) our Graduated Friend. But if <hi>ſome</hi> have died, their Number is <hi>very Small.</hi> Dr. JURIN, as <hi>D—s</hi> confeſſes, has ſhewed that, of thoſe who have been inoculated in <hi>Great Britain, nine</hi> only have died in 448, which is <hi>one</hi> in about 49, or 50. And the ſame ingenious Doctor has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Bills of Mortality at <hi>London,</hi> that one in about 6, or 7, or 8. at fartheſt, have died of the <hi>natural Small-Pox.</hi> For my part I am ready to acknowlege, (what he deſires and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for pag. 22.) that but <hi>one</hi> in <hi>ten</hi> here have died of the <hi>natural Small-Pox</hi>; or, if it will ſatify him and his Chronies, that but <hi>one</hi> in <hi>Twenty</hi> have given up the Ghoſt with it: And yet, when I have allowed this, the Practice of <hi>Inoculation</hi> appears by far the moſt <hi>ſucceſsful and advantageous</hi>; and therefore every wiſe Man, in Danger of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> will prefer the taking of it <hi>by Inciſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for thoſe who have died <hi>under,</hi> or <hi>after,</hi> or (if he pleaſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>of Inoculation</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>; I cannot but think, and I have the Pleaſure to find that many are with me in the Opinion, that, if the ſordid <hi>D—s</hi> had any Thing of the <hi>Generous</hi> in his abject Mind, he would have relied upon it, that you have fairly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003296_0012_0FF03ED2ED5A4678"/>
               <hi>all and every one</hi> you knew to have died <hi>under or of it</hi>: But it ſeems he won't believe you. And why? Becauſe, forſooth, <hi>Mrs. G. whiſpers that there were many more who died of it.</hi> And will Mr. <hi>Gooſe</hi> believe her <hi>Whiſper</hi> ſooner than your <hi>open Declaration</hi>? And not ſhe alone ſays this; but (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues he p. 14.) <hi>ſome</hi> Porters <hi>ſay that it was</hi> whiſper'd <hi>in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Houſes, where the</hi> Dead <hi>had been carried from, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had been</hi> inoculated. But if he places ſuch Confidence in what <hi>ſome Porters</hi> heard whiſper'd ſure I am he deſerves to be treated like a <hi>Porter.</hi> And I cannot but think it no <hi>Small Reflection</hi> on our <hi>Ultrajectine Doctor</hi>; that he knows what <hi>the Porters</hi> ſay; it looks as if he were acquainted with them. But this is not all. To theſe Reports he adds p. 15. <hi>I am certain of</hi> one more <hi>who died after</hi> Inoculation, <hi>as they expreſs it, having with her</hi> Inoculator <hi>attended her in her Illneſs, this was Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper to</hi> &amp;c. Here I could make You and myſelf merry with that admirable Paragraph, <hi>having with her Inoculator attended her in her Illneſs</hi>; But I will not, as long as I know his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In Anſwer to which, I proteſt, firſt of all, that I queſtion whether ſhe was <hi>Inoculated</hi>? But if ſhe was, I maintain <hi>her Death</hi> is no Diſgrace to <hi>Inoculation</hi>: For it is <hi>whiſper'd,</hi> (And may not our <hi>Whiſpers</hi> be as good as <hi>D—s</hi>'?) that ſhe was a <hi>Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> who (if ſhe had not at the time of her Inoculation ſome <hi>foul Diſtemper</hi>) had ſome Remains of the <hi>Venereal</hi> Taint in her groſs &amp; filthy Body; But if ſhe were as chaſt, vertuous &amp; pure as <hi>Diana</hi> herſelf, her <hi>Small Pox Feaver,</hi> he confeſſes <hi>began after two Days,</hi> I ſuppoſe he means <hi>on the third Day</hi>: It is therefore at leaſt probable that the Wench had receiv'd <hi>the Infection before</hi>; and by conſequence it was hardly worth his while to make any noiſe about it.</p>
            <p>AS to what he has remark'd of Capt. OSBORN's Account in the Royal Tranſactions; it is enough to ſay, that thoſe Words, <hi>I knew</hi> of ſo many who were inoculated, were expres'd in a looſe and careleſs Manner by him; and that all he ſeems to mean, is, he <hi>believ'd</hi> there had been <hi>that Number</hi> or thereabouts inoculated; which indeed was all he could pretend to ſay: For it is queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable whether he did or could abſolutely <hi>know,</hi> being at <hi>London,</hi> how many you had inoculated, unleſs you had ſent him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which I ſuppoſe yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> did not. From his Account therefore, for <hi>D—s</hi> to gather and aſſert that 20 or 30 Inoculated Perſons <hi>are concealed, many of which</hi> (he ſays, p. 15.) <hi>without Doubt are in their ſilent Graves</hi>; it ſhows he has a great deal of ill natur'd <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,</hi> unreaſonable <hi>Prejudice</hi> and faulty <hi>Credulity</hi> againſt <hi>Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:003296_0013_0FF03ED54B0ACC28"/>Upon what he further relates (p. 15. &amp; 16.) of the two Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which either he or ſome other Noddy askt; I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that I conceive the <hi>latter</hi> did not anſwer his Queſtion ſo well as the <hi>former</hi>: For <hi>Silence</hi> is the beſt Anſwer to an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Queſtion, whether it be askt by a knowing Phyſician or an illiterate Mechanick.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>D—s</hi> goes on, &amp; ſays, that <hi>Inoculation ſometimes leaves Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumations and other Ails.</hi> For this he quotes a Paſſage of PYLARINUS, which I wiſh he had been ſo kind as to tranſlate, but he would not; becauſe that Author writes, however ſuch Things have happened, <hi>rariſſime tamen,</hi> they are moſt rare and unuſual. So it has proved in <hi>New-England,</hi> and perhaps the ſame would have appeared more fully in <hi>Brittain,</hi> if due Care had been taken to <hi>purge</hi> the Reſtored.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>D—s</hi> plumply affirms pag. 17. <hi>thoſe who have had a Genuine Small-Pox by</hi> Inoculation <hi>never</hi> can <hi>have</hi> it <hi>again in the natural way</hi> by Reaſon and Experience. A bold Aſſertion this! But, as bold as it is, he ſays, <hi>We may confidently pronounce</hi> it; ſo that now he ſeems to be one of <hi>us.</hi> I believe, that he, and ſome other Doctors in Town, have held the contrary; and I hope they will ſhew themſelves, now at leaſt as ingenuous as he, by making a <hi>publick Retractation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if from their Inciſions, the Patients have not <hi>the genuine Small-Pox,</hi> but <hi>imperfect Eruptions</hi>? Will theſe excuſe them from the <hi>Small-Pox</hi>? To be plain and open, Doctor BOYLSTONE, I would roundly ſay <hi>No.</hi> And I may well ſay ſo: For Dr. JURIN imagines it poſſible for thoſe who have fairly had the Small-Pox in the <hi>natural way</hi> to have it a <hi>Second Time,</hi> and He brings <hi>an example</hi> for the Proof of it: This I could not but take Notice of in his Treatiſe <hi>of Inoculation,</hi> dedicated to the Princeſs of WALES; but not having his Book, which I obtain'd of a Friend, now by me, I cannot refer to the Page where this is reported. But upon it I think it proper to remark, that as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Inſtances of this <hi>Second</hi> Infection are uncommon in the <hi>natural Way</hi>; So they are unuſual in the way of <hi>Inciſions</hi>: They are ſcarcer, a far greater Rarity than <hi>Pious</hi> and Religious <hi>Phyſicians</hi>: For <hi>ubi tres Medici, ibi duo Athei</hi>; but among <hi>three hundred</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have had the Small-Pox from <hi>Inciſions,</hi> there have hardly been <hi>two,</hi> who have had it again.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He ſays p. 20. <hi>If it is not us'd with</hi> Circumſpection, <hi>it is of</hi> pernicious Conſequence <hi>to populous and Trading Towns.</hi> Here I frankly acknowledge, that, if only <hi>two or three</hi> Perſons have the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in a City or Town, and there were no
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003296_0014_0FF03ED6D41CDD60"/>likelihood of its Spreading, it is not ſo proper, nay, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify him, it is <hi>pernicious</hi> to inoculate and ſpread the Infection: But where many already have it, and ſeveral are daily viſited with it, <hi>unbounded Inoculation</hi> (in his Style) ſeems to me ſo far from <hi>an Hardſhip</hi> and a <hi>damping of Trade,</hi> that I am verily perſwaded, if all thoſe in <hi>Boſton</hi> who have not had the <hi>Small Pox</hi> would be <hi>inoculated in one week,</hi> it would be <hi>vaſtly better</hi> for the Town: For thereby we ſhould be ſpeedily rid of the Diſtemper. But now, if the Small Pox goes on in the uſual Method, the Town muſt linger under it many Months, and its <hi>Trade</hi> and Commerce will not only <hi>be damp'd</hi>; but have <hi>a Stop</hi> in a great Meaſure put to it for a conſiderable Time.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I have nothing to write againſt what he remarks (p. 21.) of the <hi>Communication</hi> of conſtitutional <hi>Diſtempers as a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>: It will perhaps be found <hi>one,</hi> if the <hi>Pus</hi> be taken from thoſe of <hi>bad Conſtitutions and ill Habits</hi>: But where will be the <hi>Difficulty,</hi> if the <hi>Pus</hi> be taken from one, who before the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> was a ſound &amp; vigorous Youth, whoſe Juices were in a <hi>due State of Fluidity,</hi> and who therefore was <hi>in Perfect Health.</hi> In this Caſe, I ſhould think the Patient ſafe, and (to borrow from <hi>D—s</hi>) I ſhould take all <hi>Fear</hi> to be <hi>chimerical and conjectural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have gone through his ſeveral Heads or Propoſitions, which he has confirm'd by Authorities: I could eaſily ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert on ſome more Particulars under thoſe general Heads; but it is Time almoſt to conclude my Letter.</p>
            <p>Indeed I can't help thinking, that <hi>D—s</hi> himſelf, in pag 25. has <hi>in a few Lines</hi> overthrown all the foregoing Part of his <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> wherein <hi>the Difficulties and Diſcouragements of Inoculation</hi> are laid down by him: For there he allows, <hi>that the</hi> Small Pox <hi>receiv'd by</hi> Inciſions <hi>is found not ſo</hi> mortal, <hi>and that the</hi> Symptoms <hi>are generally</hi> more favourable, <hi>than when it is receiv'd by</hi> accidental Contagition. Now, you, nor I, nor yet any other reaſonable Man, can deſire any more: For if the Small Pox is <hi>leſs mortal</hi> and <hi>the Symptoms</hi> are more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by <hi>Inciſions</hi> than by the <hi>natural way</hi>; then he is a <hi>Simple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> not to ſay worſe, who when he is in Danger, will not be <hi>inoculated.</hi> And then, if, as he further writes in the ſame Page, <hi>one may take the advantage of benign Small-Pox Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and a favourable Seaſon of the Year</hi>; if one may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Body <hi>for it, and remove the Anxiety</hi> which ſome are poſſeſs'd with thro' <hi>Fear of the Small Pox</hi>: I ſay, if all theſe <hi>Benefits</hi> and Advantages flow from <hi>Inoculation,</hi> he, who is near the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and does not get <hi>inoculated,</hi> either knows not
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003296_0015_0FF03ED861619BC8"/>his Intereſt or diſregards his Welfare. <hi>D—s</hi> himſelf muſt have drawn <hi>this Concluſion,</hi> if he had made <hi>any</hi> Inference from what he ſays of the <hi>Advantages of Inoculation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It pleaſes me much, that the Phyſicians in Town don't think <hi>Inoculation criminal</hi> now, whatever might be their Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons formerly: But <hi>D—s</hi>'s Reaſon (I ſay his; for it can never be theirs) is poor for obviating <hi>their</hi> ſuſpicion that it was ſo; viz. <hi>The Example of the Royal Family.</hi> I muſt confeſs their <hi>Example</hi> is of great Force; and the ſucceſs the Practice of Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation has met with on the <hi>Royal Offſpring,</hi> the Hopes and Joys of <hi>Britain</hi> and its Dependencies is a ſtrong Inducement and ſufficient Encouragement to the Practice, were it in its own nature <hi>indifferent</hi>: But if the <hi>Practice</hi> be a <hi>Crime</hi> in it ſelf, no <hi>Examples,</hi> however <hi>ſucceſsful,</hi> in favour of it, would make it ceaſe to be <hi>criminal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What he ſays, (in page 26, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Practitioners in Town do generally reſolve to perform the Operation when requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>) is very greatful to you, I believe, as well as the other Friends of Inoculation: It ſhows they have a juſt value for the Lives of good People: their <hi>Reſolution</hi> is a credit, and their <hi>Second Thoughts</hi> will bring <hi>Honours</hi> to them: It is frequent for fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
