            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>EXPLANATORY PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the peruſal of ſeveral works on the prevention and cure of diſeaſe, I have ſeldom met with any that, according to my conceptions, have been formed with ſufficient perſpicuity; for though ſimplicity of ſtile may be eſſentially neceſſary, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the claſs of people to whom ſuch labours are addreſſed; ſtill I ſee no cauſe, why the very principles and reaſoning by which they ought to be directed in their purſuit ſhould either be totally omitted, or treated in ſo ſlight a manner, as not to afford any material advantages—the principles I mean are, the NATURE OF CONSTITUTIONS, and THE IMMEDIATE CAUSES OF DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EASE; for whether we wiſh to prevent or cure, theſe two points muſt ever be kept in view. To prove this, let us inquire, by what are we directed in our attempts to avoid diſeaſe?</p>
            <p>From the knowledge of the remote cauſes, being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the effect which they are calculated to produce in the machine, and preventing their acceſſion; but in all caſes this cannot be done; in many, prevention of that circumſtance is impoſſible—how then muſt we act? By ſo regulating the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the conſtitution, that it may be placed in ſuch a ſtate as to be rendered incapable of feeling the effect of the remote cauſe.</p>
            <p>And how can this be accompliſhed without being thoroughly acquainted with the nature of the conſtitution itſelf; Indeed, it ſeems not only neceſſary in this reſpect, but alſo to render the diſeaſe, when the cauſe has produced its conſequence, as mild as poſſible. Various proofs of the validity of this doctrine will ariſe upon ſlight conſideration. In inoculating for the ſmall-pox, we find very often great variability in the diſeaſe; and this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, it is clear, be owing to the matter by which the complaint is occaſioned, having any variability of action; for the ſame matter taken from the very ſame pock will produce in different habits a diſeaſe of very different natures, with reſpect to mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or malignancy—it is therefore obvious the variation muſt ariſe from ſome deviations in the ſeparate habits, which require
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:028021_0003_0FD627D0F4063108"/>
different modes of preparation;—and, probably, it is owing to want of accuracy in this point that ſome children after being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated die, and ſeveral fall into other maladies.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the other principle to which we muſt advert with regard to the cure; we ſhould confine ourſelves to the IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEDIATE CAUSE OR CAUSES, which, acting in the habit, produce thoſe ſymptoms, an enumeration of which is called diſeaſe; for all other cauſes in this point of view are of no avail. Matters it by what means the diſeaſe has been occaſioned, ſince the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that cauſe is paſt? the effect at this time acting as a cauſe, claims only attention, for that conquered, the diſeaſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes. To explain, let us take the Dropſy,—its cauſes have been ſaid to be, <q>an hereditary diſpoſition—drinking ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, want of exerciſe, exceſſive evacuations—ſudden ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of thoſe which are cuſtomary and neceſſary—large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of cold, weak, watery liquors drank when the body has been over-heated by violent exerciſe—a low damp marſhy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation—long uſe of poor watery diet, or viſcous aliment that is hard of digeſtion. It is often the effect of other diſeaſes, as jaundice, ſcirrhus of the liver, violent ague of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, looſeneſs, dyſentery, an empyema, or conſumption of the lungs—in ſhort, whatever obſtructs perſpiration, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the blood from being duly prepared, may occaſion a dropſy.</q> Theſe <hi>may</hi> produce this malady, I do not deny, but that not one of them is the immediate cauſe againſt which our remedies are ſolely to be levelled to perfom a cure, nor any number of them, except ſuch of which dropſy is only a ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. It is to the effect brought on by theſe cauſes that we are to attend, which I take to be <hi>general relaxation of the ſolids—a thin watery blood—and a weakened action of the abſorbents,</hi> (23.<note n="*" place="bottom">Where the figures are put without the No, theſe refer to the Page<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From the enumeration of the former, not any thing can be collected reſpecting the cure—but from the immediate cauſes every thing, as they plainly point out the indications, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to invigorate the ſolids, and increaſe the action of the abſorbent ſyſtem, that the water may be taken from the places wherein it is depoſited, and thrown out of the machine.</p>
            <p>It was the defect in theſe particulars that furniſhed one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reaſon for preſenting this work to the public, in order to ſupply other information abſolutely neceſſary, and more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially beneficial. I have therefore been obliged to divide the
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:028021_0004_0FD6700CB2693E30"/>
work into diſtinct heads—the firſt of which comprehends the ANATOMY of thoſe parts in which reſide the active powers of the conſtitution chiefly, with intent to make my reader ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature of them, their uſes, connections, and dependencies; that he might have ſome idea of the materials upon which he was to act; as well as be taught what he might expect from them: for to attempt to teach a man the mode of proceeding in any art, without informing him of the nature of the ſubject to which he is to direct his attention, would be like throwing a rough diamond to a glaſs-grinder, he might deſtroy, but never poliſh. Suppoſe a man ſeized with a pain in his bowels, attended with trifling evacuations, he ſees cordials are good in ſome of theſe caſes, and ſlight opiates—he takes them, they give him relief for ſome time—they return more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he has recourſe to the ſame remedies, 'till an inflammation comes on—conſidering the intervals of eaſe he has obtained, he has no conception how this can ariſe—let him be informed of the ſtructure and nature of the bowels, he will ſoon underſtand that they are ſubject to irritating cauſes, liable to inflammatory affections; and readily conceive why thoſe irritating cauſes muſt be removed before cordials and opiates ſhould be taken; which he could never do without ſuch knowledge of the parts. Indeed, I believe for want of this many have fallen ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <p>The parts being ſhewn in their ſimple ſtate, I have next ſpoken of them collectively, ſhewing the nature of different CONSTITUTIONS, which are formed by the combinations of theſe. I conceive this knowledge eſſential neceſſary towards the preventing of diſeaſe, palliating ſuch as are incurable, and conquering thoſe which lie within the reach of our powers; for there are a variety which require particular att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntion, in order that full effects may be given to our regimen, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal treatment; for, without the one is properly adapted to the other, we ſhall not only be foiled in our attempts to cure; but the very means uſed for preſervation from, will be inſtrumental in bringing on diſeaſe, which too frequently proves mortal. This we need not here farther elucidate, as what we have ſaid in the former part of the preface, and in the introduction, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>Thus for the parts of the machine to be acted upon have been conſidered. It remains now to ſpeak of thoſe which are the agents, the NON-NATURALS, ſo term'd, and MEDICINAL SUBSTANCES—the firſt of which have called forth my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in order to ſhew the great influence they have on, and how by being properly managed, they contribute to keep the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:028021_0005_0FD627D26E2A7F28"/>
body in a ſtate of health; for it is almoſt ſolely on them that we muſt depend for this purpoſe—for good air—proper ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, moderate in quantity—ſuitable exerciſe and reſt—with due ſubordination of mental affections, form the beſt plan for our bodily ſecurity—we have therefore endeavoured to ſhew how they act under different circumſtances, and how neceſſary it is to lay down rules with reſpect to them; which, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſupply the moſt pleaſing conſequences—freedom from pain, vigour of mind, and a placid old age; and, by neglecting, the contrary extremes—beſides, we have conſidered ſome of them with reſpect to their powers as medical ſubſtances, and ſhewn how they act, as by theſe means we might afford an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of properly combining the two, that they might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſtrengthening, and not, by producing contrary effects, counteract each other.</p>
            <p>As for medicines, there, perhaps, my reader may conſider me too ſyſtematical, as I have preſerved the terms of the ſchools, and reaſoned too abſtractly, perhaps, according to his comprehenſion. However, when it is known that I have given the derivation of every term, and explained the powers of each claſs, as commonly conceived, in a manner to render them in this place eaſily intelligible; for the terms themſelves, once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, are infinitely more expreſſive, and involve more ideas than any other which might be thought more familiar, I ſhall, I hope, ſtand excuſed, as well as for dwelling upon the powers which medicines exert; for it appeared not only neceſſary to ſpeak of the good that was likely to accrue from this action, but alſo of the miſchief which they might create, injudiciouſly applied; therefore I was to exhibit them in different views, that it might be known where their exhibition was ſafe, where uncertain, or perhaps detrimental—becauſe a medicine may be proper reſpecting a complaint to be relieved, but its mode of action injurious to the conſtitution—for inſtance, coſtiveneſs is to be removed, if it ſhould be attended with heat and pain in the bowels, ſhewing that in them there is a great irritation, and that the blood muſt circulate too freely, the ſtimulant pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, are improper, (173.)—if there ſhould be coldneſs in them, and the blood circulates uncommonly ſlow and languid the cooling, (171.) ſhould not be uſed—and if habitual coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be an error of the habit, the aſtringent kind, (172.) ſhould be avoided.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be taxed by ſome of my female readers with inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, if the riſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>r I can only reply; my animadverſion muſt yield to "who can help it" I lament the misfortune of the infant, and pity the feelings of the parent, whoſe partiality lays the foundation for ten thouſand heart-aches—and to the cuſtoms of the latter, with all their train of poiſons, I oppoſe the plain directions given under the article Nurſing—to the peruſal of which I recommend all mothers, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſuperintendants, and leave it to ſpeak for itſelf; it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complicated, founded upon facts deduced from obſervation and experience, and ſupported by the voice of reaſon.</p>
            <p>The parts of which we have here ſpoken form what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be underſtood before any one ſhould enter on the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of phyſic, as without theſe the adventurers ſail upon the boſom of a dangerous ſea, diveſted of rudder and compaſs. It muſt be ſo clear to common obſervation, that I ſhall conſider it admitted; and proceed to cloſe with the account of the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part—and here I have laboured to be as ſimple, and uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conciſe, as the nature of ſuch a work would admit.</p>
            <p>After ſhewing the tendency of the diſeaſe in general, I have particulariſed the deſcription of each, that is, collected the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which have happened, forming its hiſtory; but as the whole of theſe do not always occur, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

In this there ſeems to be a peculiar advantage, becauſe the immediate cauſe or cauſes being remembered, leads us fairly to account for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſymptoms by which the patient may be oppreſſed. This needs no exemplification, on comparing one with the other, it will appear obvious.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION. SECTION I.</head>
            <div type="introduction">
               <p>WHEN we reflect on the precariouſneſs of man's exiſtence in this life, the multiplicity of dangers with which he is ſurrounded, even from the firſt moment of his being to his ultimate ſtage; and alſo that the fabric of his machine is ſo formed, that the means neceſſary for its preſervation are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtruments wearing out its powers and conducing to diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, at the ſame time, conſider, that he is ſubject to an immenſe variety of diſeaſes, which often occaſion him to drag out a life of pain and miſery; nay, frequently cut him off even in the bloom and vigour of his age: it will not appear extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary that many men of the firſt, and moſt diſtinguiſhed abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have devoted themſelves, not only to the ſtudy of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, in order to cure thoſe maladies, by which man is conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attacked; but alſo prevent their origin, or the miſchiefs which are apt to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>From the time of GALEN, who has, upon this laſt ſubject, written moſt elaborately, to the preſent day, we have had vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous publications, calculated to inſtruct mankind in the Art of preſerving Health, preventing Diſeaſes, or ſhortening their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the uſe of judicious applications: indeed, of late years, their particular documents have been ſtudiouſly conveyed in ſuch a ſtyle, as to be readily intelligible to common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſo that each man might become, in ſome degree, his own Phyſician. Such laudable undertakings merit the higheſt praiſe, and, if well conducted, promiſe the moſt ſalutary conſequences; for there can be no doubt but the modes of preventing Diſeaſes, ſhortening their Duration, and warding off their evil tendencies by early aſſiſtance, are not only the eaſieſt, but ſafeſt, and moſt pleaſant.</p>
               <p>What has been written on this ſubject may to many, perhaps, appear ſufficient: and ſo it probably might be, were all men's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions ſimilar; for the methods adviſed by many of thoſe authors, are ſelected with great judgment, and extremely well calculated to anſwer the ends propoſed, under the circumſtance above ſpecified; but there ſeems to be a very great defect in all
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028021_0014_0FD66FE1F1D3D818"/>
the publications which have treated on theſe ſubjects—they give no information to their readers how the variations of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be diſtinguiſhed, or in what caſes the methods are properly to be altered; and without this the preſcribing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies can be conſidered little leſs than a ſpecies of quackery, by whatever authority it may be ſanctioned.</p>
               <p>The univerſality or generality of any medicine furniſhes the idea of the moſt flagrant abſurdity, ſuitable only to the arrogance of every ignorant impoſtor; and certainly appropriating reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſame ſpecific nature to one complaint in all conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, however diſſimilar, is, at leaſt, a branch of the ſame tree; for it is a fact uncontrovertible, ſupported by the ſoundeſt experience—that what may be of great ſervice to one conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may to another be highly detrimental, though labouring under the ſame affection.</p>
               <p>To elucidate this, I ſhall adduce a very familiar example—to many of my readers, perhaps, experimentally comprehenſible; I mean the mode of obviating the effects of INEBRIATION.</p>
               <p>Under this circumſtance we will ſuppoſe a man of ſtrong ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina—full habit of body—with good digeſtive powers, and a nervous ſyſtem acting with firmneſs and regularity; and one, of a relaxed conſtitution—not abounding with blood—a weak, delicate ſtomach—and the nerves eaſily irritated—</p>
               <p>The advice to alleviate the conſtitutional diſturbances occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by this indiſcretion—is lying in bed, and promoting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration by plentiful dilution, that is, drinking copiouſly of weak tea—ſmall broth—thin gruel—weak white wine or vinegar whey—or ſome ſuch liquors warm, that the ſuperabundance may be evacuated with which the patient has been loaded, and the body ſoaked, <hi>us it is termed,</hi> into its ſober ſtandard. For the robuſt man the advice might be proper—for by the ſurcharge of the vaſcular ſyſtem, and the ſtimulus of the intoxicating liquids, his habit becomes nearly to aſſume an inflammatory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, diſcovered by pain and a ſenſe of fulneſs of the head; redneſs of his eyes; quick ſtrong pulſe; much heat, and great thirſt—which are the general concomitants of ſuch a debauch; and thus he requires abſtinence, evacuation, reſt, and dilution for his alleviation. But the ſame mode, applied to the other, renders all his conſtitutional defects worſe, he experiences the uneaſy ſenſations of languor, ſickneſs, oppreſſed ſpirits, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcribable ſinkings—all increaſed by ſuch a regimen; whoſe good conſequences are derived in the former cure from relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and debilitating the ſyſtem. The delicate conſtitutioned man requires freſh air, riding on horſeback, a glaſs or two of generous wine, or ſome cordial, ſuch as will invigorate the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028021_0015_0FD6701812A894B0"/>
of his habit, promote vaſcular action, ſtrengthen his ſtomach, increaſe inſenſible perſpiration, and thus conquer thoſe unhappy feelings he labours under from increaſed weakneſs and debility. Simple as is this fact, and of little conſequence as it may be thought, the ſame peculiarities occur in diſeaſes of the moſt alarming nature; and I am perſuaded that it is from ignorance or inattention in this point, that people are apt to increaſe their maladies, nay often make that, which would, left to itſelf, have been mild, become dangerous by applications not adapted to the particular nature of the conſtitution. For as curing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes depends on the knowledge of this particular, by which we can more certainly appropriate our remedies to the benefit of the afflicted, ſo doubtleſs muſt it be a more eſſential point in preſerving from, preventing, and ſhortening their duration, as in all our endeavours we muſt attempt to keep the conſtitution in, or bring it to a ſtate of health, conſiſtent with the principle of its formation, and the nature of the particular parts of which it is formed—and how can this be accompliſhed without the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of the conſtitution are known to the perſon applying remedies, or fixing on any regimen?</p>
               <p>In order, therefore, to attain this point, as theſe ſheets are addreſſed to the un-informed, it appears unavoidable to give ſome account of the human machine, with regard to the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, dependencies and action of its parts, before we enter on the means to be uſed in particular caſes, that every man may be informed of the materials upon which his remedies and regimen are to operate; be able to diſcover their particular ſtate, and hence proceed with ſome degree of regularity and certainty.</p>
               <p>Now the human machine conſiſts of SOLIDS and FLUIDS, differently diſpoſed, for the purpoſe of ſupporting each other; ſo that as the parts are worn away or deſtroyed by the neceſſary actions of life, they may be again ſupplied; and this diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and acceſſion preſerves a conſtant routine, until the animal agreeable to the laws of nature, is deſtroyed by its own exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the machine being rendered incapable of continuing its vital actions: thus, without any preternatural cauſe, gradually deſcends to the grave.</p>
               <p>But in order to promote the different purpoſes allotted to the ſolids and fluids for the well-being of the human body, they are variouſly divided.</p>
               <p>The SOLIDS into bones, cartilages or griſtles, ligaments, muſcles with their tendons, nerves, veſſels, glands, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</p>
               <p>The FLUIDS, into blood, nervous fluid; perſpirable matter flowing through the ſkin inſenſibly, or in form of ſweat; ſaliva

ſeparated by the glands of the mouth and throat; ear-wax; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus; gaſtric and inteſtinal juices, liquids ſecreted into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and bowels; cyſtic and hepatic biles, ſeparated by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, lodged in part in the gall bladder, in part emptied into the firſt bowel called duodenum; pancreatic juice, or that of the ſweet bread: urine, ſemen, liquor of the proſtrate gland, and that fluid which moiſtens the internal ſurface of all cavities; the glary mucilaginous liquid of the joints called ſynovia; tears; mucus of the noſtrils; a white nutritious fluid ſeparated from the food in the inteſtines, called chyle, lymph, fat, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <p>It will not be neceſſary to give prolix accounts of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent component parts of the human machine; but only ſuch as may enable our readers ſo far to underſtand the anatomy, as to furniſh ideas ſufficient to aſſiſt them in purſuing the future ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with ſome requiſite degree of accuracy.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of the BONES, CARTILAGES, and other component Parts of the Body.</head>
               <p>THE BONES are the hardeſt, and moſt ſolid parts of the human machine, calculated to ſupport thoſe which are ſoft and leſs firm, in all their motions and preſſures; they are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a membrane, or thin bladdery ſubſtance, called perioſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, on account of its covering the bone, which is exquiſitely ſenſible, being plentifully ſupplied with nerves and blood veſſels. The outſides of bones are commonly more compact than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parts; and are formed of plates, joined together by tranſverſe fibres; their inſides are ſpongy and cellular, in which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained marrow, within membranous bags, filling up the cells; this marrow, being more or leſs diſtributed over all the bones, and tranſuding through their plates and fibres, makes them tougher, and leſs brittle; the bones are ſupplied both within and without, with blood veſſels and nerves.</p>
               <p>CARTILAGES or GRISTLES, are ſolid, ſmooth, white, elaſtic ſubſtances, between the hardneſs of a bone and that of a ligament, (<hi>ſee ligament below</hi>) covered with a membrane called perichondrium, becauſe it covers a cartilage, which is akin to the perioſteum of the bones; they ſerve to make the bones, whoſe extremities or ends they cover, move freely in the joints: they limit the growth of bones, as to their length, by hindering the bony fibres from ſprouting out; and, therefore, when the cartilages in the joints are eroded, an immobility is there form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, called anchyloſis, or ſtiff joint, by the elongation and coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fibres of the bones that are articulated together; ſometimes they ſerve as ligaments to join the bones together, and ſometimes they do the office of bones to greater advantage than theſe would do; as the cartilages of the ribs, which, by their elaſticity chiefly contribute towards expiration; the carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages that make out brims of cavities, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>LIGAMENTS are white, tough, flexible bodies, thicker and firmer than membranes, and not ſo hard or ſolid as cartilages, without cavity; difficulty ſtretched and with little elaſticity; they ſerve to connect parts together, and keep the part to which they are fixed in a proper ſituation, as appears remarkably in the joints or articulations; they are made up of fibrous layers or ſtrata; the largeſt and ſtrongeſt of which run lengthwiſe.</p>
               <p>MUSCLE.—This is the name of the immediate organical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of motion in the animal body, whether voluntary or
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028021_0018_0FD66FECAB8772A8"/>
involuntary; it is called organical, becauſe mere elaſticity is the immediate cauſe of ſome motions, as in expiration<note n="*" place="bottom">The arteries have been ſuppoſed by ſome to contract themſelves after diſtenſion by this elaſtic power; though they may in ſome degree, yet not totally, for they certainly, and I believe it is generally allowed, act by the contractile power of their muſcular coat, as may be inſtanced in bluſhing—and their ſudden increaſe of action from other local irritat.</note>.</p>
               <p>The general characteriſtic of a muſcle is, to conſiſt of fleſhy fibres which, when acting, contract themſelves, and become ſhorter; this contraction, according to different circumſtances of the muſcle, and the parts to which it is faſtened, produces differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent effects, and different motions.</p>
               <p>If one end of a muſcle is tied to a fixed part, and the other to a moveable one, when it acts, its fibres contracting will pull the moveable part to that which is fixed.</p>
               <p>If both the parts, to which the extremities of a muſcle are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached, be moveable, by its action, they will be both drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other.</p>
               <p>If the muſcle be hollow, and contain a fluid, when it contracts, it will preſs upon, and endeavour to expel its contents; ſuch a muſcle as the heart, and in ſome meaſure the ſtomach, and uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bladder.</p>
               <p>If the fibres of a muſcle return upon themſelves, in the form of a ring, when they contract, they will diminiſh the area within that circumference, making the circle narrower. Such muſcles are employed to ſhut cavities, and are called ſphincters, becauſe they have the power of cloſing cavities and reſtraining the exit of any thing they contain.</p>
               <p>TENDONS.—Theſe are continuations of fleſhy, muſcular fibres; each tendon being diviſible into as many fibres, or rather bundles of fibres, as the muſcle itſelf is to which it belongs; but the tendinous fibres are more compacted and ſmaller, drier and harder, than the fleſhy fibres; they are not capable of contraction, but ſerve like ropes to pull, when the fleſhy fibres act, for the commodiouſneſs and firmneſs of inſertion, and for the direction of motion.</p>
               <p>NERVES.—Theſe are ſoft white cords, proceeding either from the brain or ſpinal marrow, and running to every minute part of the body, and are the immediate inſtruments of ſenſation, and indiſpenſably neceſſary for the continuance of muſcular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are ſuppoſed by many to contain a very ſubtile fluid, but appear without any cavity diſcernible even by the fineſt microſcope.</p>
               <p>VESSELS in the machine mean the animal tubes or canals
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028021_0019_0FD6701E1D2C6DF8"/>
through which fluids or juices move; the leaſt imaginable veſſel is made of the leaſt membrane, rolled up in the form of a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cylinder, or part of a cone. The veſſels, as their coats muſt be thicker, are compoſed of thicker membranes, upon which ſmaller veſſels run.</p>
               <p>Theſe are divided into ARTERIES, VEINS, ABSORBENTS, SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRETORY veſſels, and EXCRETORY ducts.</p>
               <p>ARTERY.—This is the name of that kind of veſſel which, ariſing originally from the heart, contains a fluid whoſe motion is directed from thence towards the extremities and ſurface of the body. The larger and eaſily viſible arteries contain red blood, are of a conical figure—flew, tapering from the heart for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ramifying variouſly; in living animals they be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> or have what is called a pulſe, anſwering to the motion of the heart; their coats look whitiſh, and are pretty thick and ſtrong.</p>
               <p>VEINS.—Theſe contain a fluid whoſe motion is from the extremities or ſurface of the body towards the heart; their coats are thinner and more tranſparent than thoſe of the arteries, and, therefore, they appear of a bluiſh, livid colour, the blood ſhining through them. In many places they have valves within them, which open towards the heart, and ſhut the contrary way.</p>
               <p>ABSORBENT VESSELS.—So called, becauſe they abſorb or take up fluids, and are divided into LYMPHATICS and LACTEALS, from the particular liquids they convey to other parts—they are ſimilar, only have different origins, and calculated for different purpoſes, from whence they take their names, the former convey the lymph or aqueous fluids, the latter the milky juice, formed from the aliment in the inteſtines called chyle; the lymphatics are the general abſorbents, and carry the juices to what is called the receptaculum chyli, thoracic duct, and left ſubclavian vein; the lacteals to the receptaculum chyli, or receptacle of the chyle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>lymphatics</hi> and <hi>lacteals</hi> are very fine veſſels; the former of which ariſe from the ſurface of the body, and all cavities or cells of the cellular membrane; the ſurface of the inteſtines, of the urine and gall bladders, of the ventricles of the brain, and of all other parts, and carry a pelucid liquor towards the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum chyli, and the thoracic duct, in which, like the lacteals, do they all terminate.</p>
               <p>SECRETORY VESSELS.—Theſe are all thoſe tubuli or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute tubes, in the different organs, which are adapted for the purpoſes of ſecretion, preſumed to ſeparate and ſtrain off the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent humours from the general maſs of fluids.</p>
               <p>EXCRETORY VESSELS are thoſe tubes or ducts which alſo belong to the different organs of ſenſation; whoſe office is to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028021_0020_0FD66FEEB90D3980"/>
carry off the humours that are ſeparated, and either convey them to their appropriated receptacles, where ſome of them are depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, or diſcharge them out of the body.</p>
               <p>GLAND denotes in general an organical texture, of a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed figure, framed ſo as to ſeparate from the blood, a liquid, different from, and unlike the blood; of theſe are various kinds, ſome more ſimple, others more complex or compounded and are called by the common people, kernel.</p>
               <p>MEMBRANE.—This is a web or rather a lamina, or ſlough formed of a very thin ſubſtance, appearing like a bladder, whoſe thickneſs bears a very ſmall proportion to its breadth and length. Moſt, if not all the membranes, we ſee in the animal body, are compoſed of; and reſolvable into thinner ones.</p>
               <p>FIBRE is a ſmall thread or filament, without a cavity, at leaſt without one viſible; whoſe breadth and thickneſs bears a very ſmall proportion to its length; the leaſt fibre of all is too minute to be perceived by our ſenſes, however aſſiſted. The fibres we can perceive, are no other than ſo many bundles of ſmaller ones tied together.</p>
               <p>Now theſe are the different ſolids of the human machine ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered, and being differently diſpoſed and united, by means of the cellular membrane, of which we ſhall ſoon ſpeak, form the human body. This is divided into the LIVING SOLIDS, called <hi>ſolida viva,</hi> and into the INERT SOLIDS, called <hi>ſolida in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertia,</hi> which conſtitute the hard parts, and help to complete the cellular ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>Theſe are again divided by phyſiologiſts, or thoſe who treat of the human body and teach the uſes of its various parts, into three ſyſtems. The VASCULAR SYSTEM—the NERVOUS SYS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEM—and the CELLULAR SYSTEM.</p>
               <p>The FIRST of theſe has the heart for its center; that is to ſay, all the tubes or canals which are comprehended in this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, either carry fluids out from the heart, or return and convey them to it, and comprehend every ſpecies of <hi>artery, vein, ſinus, duct,</hi> and <hi>abſorbent veſſel,</hi> and may be diſtinguiſhed into <hi>circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory veſſels, excretory veſſels</hi> and <hi>abſorbents;</hi> veſſels, through which the blood circulates, by which particular fluids are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it, by which theſe laſt are carried from the place where ſeparated, and by which fluids are taken up, and carried into the machine.</p>
               <p>The CIRCULATORY VESSELS include all the arteries, which ſpringing from the <hi>aorta</hi> or large artery of the heart, and that called pulmonary, ſupplying the lungs, carry out the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral maſs of blood, and all the veins, which being reflected back,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028021_0021_0FD6701B1EDC6018"/>
and uniting at the two great ſinuſes of the heart, return it, and thus maintain perpetual circulation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecretory, excretory veſſels,</hi> and <hi>abſorbents,</hi> we have before explained.</p>
               <p>The SECOND or NERVOUS SYSTEM, has the brain as its baſis, from whence iſſue different portions called medulla oblon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pinalis, and nerves. Some affirm that there are two ſets of nerves—the one adapted principally for the purpoſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and ſenſation, beſtowed on the ſeveral organs of ſenſe, internal and external; while the other is blended with the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fibres, becauſe it is obſervable in certain diſeaſes, that the muſcular ſtrength ſhall be totally exhauſted, and yet the powers of perception and ſenſation remain entire; and on the other hand that the muſcles ſhall ſometimes exert prodigious ſtrength, while the ſenſes are all locked up, hence the authority on which is founded the diſtinction.</p>
               <p>But we muſt obſerve, that though all animal motion ſeems to be derived from the nervous ſyſtem, and although the heart, like every other muſcle, can act no longer than the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the nerves which are beſtowed on it, remains free; yet there is a neceſſity for diſtinguiſhing between the vaſcular and nervous ſyſtems; becauſe it will appear, when we come to inquire into the nature of diſeaſes, that there may be evident diſorder in the one, while little or none ſhall appear in the other; and this conſideration will greatly influence us in the directions neceſſary to be given for procuring relief.

               <p>The INERT SOLIDS, not only conſtitute ſuch parts of the body as have neither nerves nor veſſels; <abbr>viz.</abbr> the cuticle and its continuations; the nails; the hair; great ſhare of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bones; cartilages; ligaments; tendons and their membranes: but theſe inert ſolids form the connecting medium every where between the living ſolids, binding together every minute veſſel and nervous filament; and there are innumerable nerves and veſſels in all parts of the body, except thoſe above mentioned, which no eye can trace; yet, if we reaſon from ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and ſay, that the ſmalleſt branches and filaments are like the viſible trunks and cords, then the tranſverſe ſection of theſe muſt be circular; and conſequently when they come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven or laid together, they muſt univerſally leave interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate pores, and minute cavities; hence we may underſtand, that though there may be ſome parts of the body, which have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nerves nor veſſels, i. e. <hi>no living ſolids,</hi> yet there is no place in the whole fabric to which the cellular ſyſtem does not extend, and where there is not ſome picture of inert ſolids; beſides u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028021_0022_0FD66FF04E646708"/>
and binding together the different ſpecies of veſſels, which either riſe from or terminate at the heart; and all the nervous cords or filaments, which ſpring from the brain or ſpinal marrow, however variouſly they may be combined, diſpoſed, or interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and this fibrous and laminated connecting ſubſtance is not endowed, like the living ſolids, with either ſenſe of feeling or power of motion.</p>
               <p>That the CELLULAR SYSTEM extends itſelf univerſally throughout the whole frame, and has a general and free commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, ſeems fully proved by ſome particular diſeaſes, ſuch as univerſal dropſy, called anaſarca; where water diffuſes itſelf through the whole body; or emphyſema, where air occupies the ſame ſpace, paſſing from pore to pore, and cell to cell; for this membrane conſiſts of a number of little cells, hence its name, which in many parts communicate with each other.</p>
               <p>In the natural and healthy ſtate, the cavities of the cellular ſyſtem, are either filled with a thin fine fluid called lymph, or with oil—hence it is diſtinguiſhed into two parts, the lymphatic and adipoſe, according to the ſubſtances it contains.</p>
               <p>The pores, or minute cavities of the lymphatic part, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be underſtood as interpoſed between every nervous fibril; whereas the adipoſe cells are not ſo univerſally extended, the fat or animal oil being always lodged in diſtinct bags or veſicles, elſe, was it ſuffered to diffuſe itſelf as freely through the cellular ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem at large, it would be equally diſtreſſing and fatal with the ſpreading of water in an univerſal dropſy, or of elaſtic air in an emphyſema.</p>

               <p>HAVING now ſhewn the ſolid principles, and the ſyſtems of which the human body, aggregately conſidered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, we ſhall take a view of ſome parts which are formed out of theſe, with their fluids and uſes, and give ſuch accounts as may be requiſite for the proper information of our readers, to enable them to diſcover what parts are affected in particular diſeaſes, and diſtinguiſh their nature. We therefore begin with the BRAIN, which is a ſoft pulpy ſubſtance, ſurrounded by two membranes, one called <hi>dura,</hi> the other the <hi>pia mater</hi>—and has alſo a third called <hi>arachnoid,</hi> from its fineneſs, ſimilar to a ſpider's web—the chief
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028021_0023_0FD6701E24517858"/>
peculiarities to be taken notice of for our purpoſes are the SI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUSES, which are nothing more than large veins or receptacles for blood, and the VENTRICLES. Like other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it has a variety of arterial branches coming from the heart, which are diffuſed through its ſubſtance, and on the membranes—from this is derived the whole nerves of the human machine, as the ſpinal marrow is no more than a continuation of the brain through the vertebrae of the back—and this is conſidered the ſource of all perception, ſenſation, and ſupport of muſcular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—It is not conſidered in itſelf very ſenſible, but can tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit moſt acute ſenſations to every part of the body by means of the nerves, when in a ſtate of health—and moſt violent ones when diſeaſed; there is not the ſmalleſt portion of the living ſolids but is materially connected with it—ſo that it not only gives ſtrong impreſſions to, but feels ſtrong impreſſion from the ſmalleſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when affected; and it may be conſidered the fountain of all nervous incitability, by which all the parts dependent upon the nerves are put into motion, or continued capable of perſevering in their action.</p>
               <p>And here, as we ſhall often have occaſion to ſpeak of NER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOUS INCITABILITY, and MUSCULAR IRRITABILI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, two powers to which we allow the exiſtence of the machine, in a living ſtate, and the action of all its moving ſolids with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their continuance, are entirely owing, it will be proper to deſcribe what we mean by theſe two terms; becauſe they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do in ſome degree exiſt independent of each other, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their intimate union, and in general conjunct action—and alſo, as by this knowledge, we ſhall in ſome caſes be able to diſcover, how from particular defect in theſe two powers, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately attended to, diſeaſes put on different appearances—and are to be prevented, alleviated, or cured by our applications made to them diſtinctively as well as unitedly.</p>
               <p>By INCITABILITY we mean that power in the brain and nervous ſyſtem, which may be put into action by mental affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as local irritation, and which produces thoſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances we call ſympathetic.</p>
               <p>By IRRITABILITY we mean that power which may be put into action by material ſtimulus locally exerted—yet is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the influence of the nerves in general—and cannot, in the living machine, exiſt for any conſiderable time without this union.</p>
               <p>To elucidate this, we ſhall obſerve that many will be thrown into convulſions by uneaſineſs of mind—we alſo know that the ſame complaint will be occaſioned by ſevere irritation on ſome part or parts of the machine; or that parts themſelves only will,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028021_0024_0FD66FF22E30FF38"/>
from this ſource, experience ſuch effects—as in cramps. Now as we are totally ignorant how the mind acts upon the brain, and nervous ſyſtem—how theſe act upon the muſcular fibres—nor can we conceive how immateriality, which we take the thinking faculty to be, can act upon materiality, we can by no means make uſe of a term which points out ſpecifically the action of theſe cauſes productive of morbid effects.</p>
               <p>In order then either to prevent, alleviate, or cure the complaint from thence ariſing, we preſcribe ſuch things as may amuſe the mind, and keep it free from thoſe painful reflections—and put the body into ſuch a ſtate as to render it leſs ſuſceptible of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from this ſource.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, we advert to the part or parts affected, and by our applications locally directed endeavour to remove the irritative cauſe in order to promote a cure—and with intent to prevent a return, do ſuch things as to render the part or parts incapable of being affected by the cauſe, or put under ſuch circumſtances as to render the acceſſion of that cauſe impracticable—hence we think the diſcrimination between the two terms abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary—as we ſhall in adviſing remedies always pay the ſtricteſt attention to conſtitutional peculiarities.</p>
               <p>The LUNGS are ſituated in the cheſt, and there divided into two large portions called LOBES, the one on the right, and the other on the left ſide, which are ſeparated from one another by a tranſverſe membrane called mediaſtinum—dividing the cheſt into two equal ſeparate cavities, that have no communication with one another: but the left lobe of the lungs is conſiderably leſs than the right, becauſe the heart with its membrane, called pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricardium, from its ſurrounding the heart, with the great veſſels that open into it, are contained in the left diviſion.—The lungs, beſides their external membrane, and cellular texture of which they are compoſed, are a congeries of air veſſels from the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, which is a firm tube, made up of cartilaginous or griſtly rings, joined together by muſcular fibres—theſe rings backwards are incomplete; this deſcends into the breaſt almoſt to the baſis of the heart, and there divides into two great branches, the one right, and the other left; which again are divided and ſubdivid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into leſſer and leſſer ramifications—and ſo diſtributed through all the ſubſtance of the lungs, terminating at length in ſmall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous, dilatable cells, or veſicles—as well as theſe, there are veſſels which carry blood, and juices derived from the blood; and theſe two kind of canals are ſo uniformly diſperſed through the lungs, that in every phyſical point there are branches all over, beſides theſe they are ſupplied with nerves and abſorbents. Various are the uſes of this organ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:028021_0025_0FD6701F8669B558"/>
The moſt important is that of <hi>reſpiration,</hi> by which a trajec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blood is effected through their ſubſtance, and circulation completed, in which life conſiſts; by comminuting, condenſing, and rounding its particles, and thereby adapting them to flow through the canals of different ſizes in the body; creating red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in its globules—beſides it has ſeveral uſes which are of the greateſt conſequence to the animal, for by this means the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal viſcera are with a continuance alternately preſſed upon, and freed from that compreſſion; by which means concoction in the ſtomach and inteſtines is promoted; and the circulation through the ſyſtem of the vena portarum, or large vein of the liver, which otherwiſe would be too ſluggiſh, is urged on. The faeces and urine are expelled by its efforts; ſmelling is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by inſpiring, or ſnuffing up air; the foetus is excluded by its aſſiſtance; and ſuction, ſo neceſſary for the preſervation of the new-born animal, is performed, and without it there could be no ſuch thing as voice or ſpeech brought about. Beſides, the lungs are conſidered as the recipient of animal heat, that is, the quantity of atmoſpheric air which ruſhes into the lungs at every inſpiration being loaded with thoſe particles creating heat, they are ſeparated from the air and paſs into the blood, and by their evolution through the courſe of circulation form an univerſal ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus to the vaſcular ſyſtem—and at the ſame time they perform the office of excretion, throwing out ſuch matters which have become uſeleſs, and would be hurtful if continued in the habit.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the cheſt between the two lobes of the lungs, rather inclining in its poſition to the left ſide, lies the HEART. It is a ſtrong hollow muſcle, having two cavities, ſeparated by a ſeptum or diviſion, which are called ventricles, out of which iſſue the two large arteries of the human machine—one called pulmonary artery, becauſe it ſerves the lungs; the other aorta, or large artery of the body; near the mouths of theſe two ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles are two other hollow muſcular ſubſtances, from their ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to dogs ears, called auriculae, into which the veſſels call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vena cava deſcendens, and aſcendens, and pulmonary veins open—the two former into the right, the latter into the left. It is alſo enveloped with a membrane from its ſituation, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart, called pericardium, by which, and the large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, it is kept in a fixed poſition, within this membrane there is a ſmall portion of a ſerous fluid.</p>
               <p>As we have conſidered the brain to be the ſource of all <hi>incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> ſo do we the heart one at leaſt, and that the principal ſource of <hi>irritability,</hi> whoſe chief office is to promote the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the blood, an account of which may not in this place be improper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:028021_0026_0FD66FF35CC78DC0"/>
But before we enter on that ſubject, we muſt obſerve, that all the arteries of the machine ramify from the aorta, as branches of a tree from its trunk, dividing themſelves into minute ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which there are no valves, except at the origin; whilſt the veins muſt be looked upon as branches forming a large trunk, in which there are valves inſerted, which open to the heart. Now in the former of theſe veſſels there is required no ſuch contrivance, becauſe the blood, having a quick progreſſive motion from the contractile power of the heart and arteries, has a ſufficient force impelling it from behind, which prevents its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troceſſion, whilſt, on the other hand the ſlow motion of the blood in the veins and their weaker contractile power, unaſſiſted with a force adequate to that of the heart, have great need of ſuch an invention to prevent its regurgitation, and ſecure its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the heart.</p>
               <p>Now for a moment let us ſuppoſe the heart full of blood, that is, the ventricles have ceaſed to beat, and that it is put into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſome cauſe, what will be the reſult with regard to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation? The leſſer circulation through the lungs will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the following manner; the blood will be propelled into the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle, paſs through the lungs, and return to the left auricle by the pulmonary vein; in the ſame manner in the greater circulation it will alſo be forced into the aorta, diffuſed through the reſt of the machine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the right auricle by the vena cava, paſſing through the different glands, in order for them to ſecrete ſuch fluids as they are deſtined for; whilſt, at the ſame time, the capillary or hair like tubes, where there is no ſuch glandular contrivance, will paſs off the matter of perſpiration, the auricles then being filled with blood will contract; eject their contents into each ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and the ſame routine be performed again as above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
               <p>The particular organs which we have now mentioned muſt be looked upon as the three moſt material ones for the ſupport, and preſervation of life, and the ſources and inſtruments of <hi>incitabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and <hi>irritability,</hi> by which they perform their actions, and on which all the moving powers of the machine depend; but into the account we muſt alſo take the blood, which, with the lungs, we conſider as the recipient and diffuſer of that fluid, or thoſe particles which animate nature, and ſupply an univerſal ſtimulus, which occaſions the action of theſe ſources and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vital motion.</p>
               <p>The BLOOD is a red homogeneous or apparently uniform fluid, as it circulates in the veſſels, from whence all the other fluids of the human machine are ſecreted, or ſeparated; but
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028021_0027_0FD6702541ACE0F8"/>
when out of the body, and left to itſelf, diviſible into three diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct ſubſtances—<hi>ſerum, gluten,</hi> and <hi>red globules,</hi> by a very ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proceſs; though untouched, appearing only as two, called <hi>ſerum</hi> and <hi>craſſamentum,</hi> the latter floating in the former; but the craſſamentum is of different degrees of firmneſs in different ſubjects.</p>
               <p>The SERUM in an healthy ſtate is almoſt colourleſs; at other times, it is yellowiſh, or perhaps of a greeniſh hue, while the top of the craſſamentum has different degrees of firmneſs, and puts on different appearances with reſpect to colour, according to the age, ſex, and ſtate of health of the ſubject from whence it is taken. The ſerum of the blood, like the white <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The CRASSAMENTUM is compoſed of a peculiar ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which gives redneſs to the blood, and of, what phyſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts term, coagulable lymph, from its coagulating ſpontaneouſly: This coagulable lymph may be ſeparated from the red part in two ways; either by ſtirring the blood which is freſh drawn, with a whiſk, when the lymph coagulating in a ſhort time, will adhere to the twigs, and appear like a firm membrane of a whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour, compoſed of fibres interwoven with each other; or by placing a piece of craſſamentum on a ſtrainer, and pouring on water repeatedly, until the red particles being waſhed away ſhall leave only the whitiſh ſubſtance behind.</p>
               <p>With regard to the red globules, it is not perfectly agreed of what nature they are; but it is aſſerted that the red colour is owing to a mixture of ſome portion of ferruginous or iron mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in confirmation of which it may be obſerved, that the blood always becomes florid after a courſe of medicines of that nature; but whether it ariſes chiefly from the addition of ferruginous matter, or owing to the increaſed motion which theſe medicines always produce, will admit of ſome diſpute, for it is always found that the blood grows more red, in proportion to the action and the ſtrength of the veſſels, and theſe medicines are allowed to produce ſuch effects.</p>
               <p>The proportion of the red part is ſmall in reſpect to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtituent parts, for one grain weight of this colouring matter, will tinge, in a perceptible degree, a thouſand of pure water.</p>
               <p>Now as the blood in its healthful ſtate is a tenacious fluid, capable of receiving a greater portion of heating particles in proportion to its tenacity, as it paſſes through the lungs, ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028021_0028_0FD627CF6836A1C8"/>
to its ſtronger or weaker tenacity, will it be capable of retaining more or leſs of theſe ſtimulating particles, thus from this cauſe, will it be more or leſs ſtimulant, and aſſiſt in produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different deviations in the conſtitution, beſides it is from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cauſes liable to undergo many alterations; hence alſo will other differences be formed, of which we ſhall take notice in the ſucceeding pages.</p>
               <p>Indeed we might give ſome general practical ideas reſpecting this point; but as many peculiarities ariſe from the ſtate of other organs in the machine, that are worthy of obſervation, and neceſſarily combined with thoſe already pointed out; we muſt now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>THE THORAX or BREAST. This is a large cavity, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the ſhape of a cone, reaching from the lower part of the neck to the abdomen or lower belly, from which it is divided by the diaphragm, or midriff. The bones which form this cavity are twelve vertebrae of the back behind, twelve ribs on each ſide, and the ſternum or breaſt bone before. This cavity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably ſhorter before than behind, from the diaphragm ſlanting downwards, and backwards. The ribs which guard the greateſt part of the cavity of the thorax, are all articulated with their reſpective vertebrae, in ſuch a manner as to admit of a motion upwards and downwards; they are all, except the lowermoſt or twelfth rib, connected and articulated with the ſternum, or breaſt bone; by the intervention of cartilages, or griſtles, ſo as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the ſame motion upwards and downwards.</p>
               <p>From the ſtructure of the ribs which are more or leſs arched, being convex outwardly, and concave inwardly towards the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the thorax, it follows, that if the ribs are all moved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, round their articulation with the vertebrae, their arched middle parts muſt be puſhed outwards and laterally, and the ſternum, to which they are joined, outwards and forwards; and conſequently, the cavity of the thorax will be widened and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</p>
               <p>But there is a ſet of muſcles which perform this office, which are called intercoſtals, from their being ſituated between the ribs, and are both internal and external; they run obliquely from the edges of one rib to thoſe of the ribs neareſt each other, for the whole length of the ribs, and from the higheſt rib to the loweſt: the fibres of the external have a direction contrary to that of the internal, by which contrivance their joint action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the more ſteady, and the ribs being pulled in the diagon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of thoſe two directions, endeavour to pull the ribs nearer one another; drawing the inferior ribs nearer the ſuperior, and thus
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028021_0029_0FD6702722A28BF0"/>
the cavity of the thorax is widened, that the lungs may expand themſelves in inſpiration.</p>
               <p>But there is another contrivance to promote this purpoſe; the DIAPHRAGM or MIDRIFF. This muſcle, which divides the breaſt from the lower belly, ariſes from the breaſt bone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from all the ribs on each ſide, from the ſeventh to the twelfth; and behind from the laſt vertebrae of the thorax, and the firſt one of the two loins. Its fibres run fleſhy from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference to the center ſome way, and then become tendinous; the whole diaphragm ſlants, its anterior origins being remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly higher than its poſterior ones; it is not plain, but remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly convex towards the thorax, and concave towards the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; inſomuch that its middle or center riſes always higher in the thorax than its higheſt origin at the ſternum; when it acts, the fleſhy fibres ſhortening, pulls the tendinous center towards their origin, that is, downwards, thereby rendering it plainer, and leſs convex, and ſo lengthening the cavity of the thorax down; hence the enlargement of the breaſt is promoted two ways, by the intercoſtal muſcles raiſing the ribs, and making it wider; and the action of the diaphragm rendering it longer or deeper—and by theſe means the ſeveral uſes above ſpecified from the action of reſpiration, is promoted. See page 28.</p>
               <p>Immediately under the diaphragm lies the LIVER. It is of an irregular ſhape—its right part fills almoſt all, what is called the right hypochondre, or ſide under the ribs below the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm, in an adult body, when ſound, reaching commonly no lower than the ſhort ribs. In the foetus it is bigger, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reſt of the body, in all its dimenſions—its middle part lies in the region over the ſtomach, called epigaſtrium; and its left in the upper part of the left hypochondre, not reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far down as the right; ſome of its exterior parts are ſmooth and convex, humouring the concavity of the diaphragm; its under part is concave on the right ſide anſwering to the gut called the colon before, and the right kidney behind; its middle part, in which the gall bladder, called the veſica fellis is placed, lies over the gut, called duodenum, which touches the gall blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; its left part covers the ſtomach—it is thick in the middle, and upper ſubſtance, towards its ſides it grows ſlenderer, at length terminating in a thin edge; by a furrow in the interior and concave part which receives the umbilical vein, or that of the navel in the foetus, on its anterior part; and by another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to that backwards reaching to the poſterior limits of the liver, which receives the venous duct, both which canals are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious veſſels in the foetus, but in the grown animal degenerate into ligaments, the liver is divided into two unequal parts call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

lobes; the right being much larger than the left; there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a ſmall lobe in its poſterior concave part, commonly called the lobule of Spigelius; there is likewiſe a tranſverſe foſſa, or furrow, running along the middle of its concave, and under part, in ſome meaſure ſeparating its anterior and larger from its poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and ſmaller part; it is attached to the diaphragm, and its weight is in ſome meaſure ſupported by ligaments from that muſcle, which are productions from the membrane which lines the inſide of the lower belly called peritonaeum, where it lines its concave ſurface, and is united by other ſuch productions, with the neighbouring parts: it is furniſhed with arteries from ramifications of the aorta, called coeliac, mammary, phrenic, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and capſular—but it is furniſhed with veins of two kinds—totally differing from each other, which cannot truly be ſaid of any other part of the body: to wit, the vena portarum, and its branches diſtributed through the ſubſtance of the liver, which perform the office of arteries, carrying blood into it; and the other veins, which carry blood out of it, emptying themſelves into the vena cava, like the reſt, all over the body.</p>
               <p>As the reſt of the arteries and veins may be compared to the trunk of a tree with its branches, ſo may the vena portae and its different ramification, be compared to the root, trunk, and branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es—for it is formed by a conflux of all the veins, which return the blood from the ſtomach, omentum, ſpleen, pancreas, inteſtines, and meſentery; and anſwer to the coeliac, and meſenteric, both ſuperior and inferior, arteries.—It is worthy to be obſerved, that all this venous ſyſtem, which by its union conſtitutes the vena portarum is unfurniſhed, unlike the other veins of the body, with valves; ſo that from its trunk it may be injected backwards to the minuteſt origins of ſmall veins, in all the parts juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The trunk of the vena portarum, thus formed, enters the liver between two eminences in the little lobe, called by the ancients, portae—that is, ridges forming a little channel or ſtreight between them: as ſoon as it is formed into a trunk it is found to have got ſtronger membranes or walls than other veins, and even tougher than the aorta or large artery of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy itſelf. This new and extraordinary ſtrength of the coats of the branches of the vena portarum, they carry with them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the ſubſtance of the liver; and they are diſtributed from trunks to branches, ſmaller and ſmaller, in the ſame manner as arteries are in the other viſcera.</p>
               <p>Thus is blood brought into the liver by arteries, called hepatic, of the common ſort; and beſides by the vena portarum, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtrong coats, and performing the office of an artery, the only inſtance of that kind in the whole body. The ultimate
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028021_0031_0FD67028778DCD40"/>
ſmall capillary branches, both of the hepatic arteries, and vena portarum, terminate in minute venous twigs, which ariſing all over the ſubſtance of the liver, and forming larger and larger branches by uniting together, at length open by ſeveral large mouths into the vena cava about the poſterior, or gibbous part of the liver.</p>
               <p>The liver is ſupplied with nerves from the intercoſtal, and par vagum ſo called;—they are but ſmall in proportion to its bulk, and therefore it is not liable to violent pains.</p>
               <p>The great uſe of the liver is to ſeparate bile, for many good purpoſes in the animal oeconomy; and as it is now and then wanted more at ſome times, than at others, there is in the liver a receptacle for part of this fluid, called the GALL-BLADDER, which is a pretty large hollow veſſel, nearly the ſhape of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long pear—ſituated in a fovea or furrow, in the anterior concave part of the right lobe of the liver, reaching from before back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; attached to the liver in different places by a cellular tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, covered over in its under part, by a portion of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the liver, which reaching beyond it keeps it faſt in its ſituation. Under this, all over its ſurface, is a cellular texture—next to that, a thin muſcular coat, conſiſting of pretty conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, longitudinal, oblique, and circular fibres; under that a ſecond cellular—then a nervous; and innermoſt of all a villous coat, ſimilar to what is found in the ſtomach and inteſtines. There are likewiſe, eſpecially in its ſmaller part or neck, pores, which yield a mucous juice, to defend it againſt the acrimony of the bile: from the ſame part is produced its duct, which ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the left is inſerted into one called the <hi>hepatic duct,</hi> which ariſes from the repeated union, and conflux of the biliary ducts all over the liver; the union of theſe two ducts together forms the duct, called the <hi>ductus communis cholidochus,</hi> which penetrates into the duodenum, or firſt of the ſmall guts, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſtomach. Thus we find the bile ſeparated by the pori biliarii of the liver, paſſes into the hepatic duct, part of which is conſtantly pouring into the duodenum, and part into the gall-bladder, whoſe uſe is to receive the bile, there to retain it, until it be ſqueezed back again by preſſure of the diſtended ſtomach, and action of the diaphragm, through the ductus communis into the duodenum;—by ſtaying there, the bile is tendered thicker, ſome of its aqueous parts being reſorbed by the inhaling veſſels of its villous coat, and therefore ſtronger, and of a more ſaturat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yellow; it likewiſe becomes more ſharp, bitter, and rancid, by the heat of the contiguous and circumjacent parts; while the ſtomach is empty the gall-bladder is at liberty to be diſtended and filled, and therefore becomes fuller after long faſting; and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028021_0032_0FD66FF7AF91EEC8"/>
the fuller it is, the leſs compreſſion of the ſtomach is required to ſqueeze the bile out of it—ſo that the more we are prompted to eat, and ſtuff the ſtomach by violent hunger, the greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of bile will be poured into the duodenum, by the ſwelling of the ſtomach during digeſtion, to promote ſo much more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the coction of the aliments; and the cyſtic bile will be the ſharper, and ſtronger, by having remained ſo much the longer in the gall-bladder.</p>
               <p>So that we find the duodenum receives two ſorts of bile flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it from the ſame canal, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the hepatic freſh ſecreted from the liver, which never has been in the gall-bladder, but goes ſtraight on into the inteſtines, and the cyſtic alſo.</p>
               <p>Both biles are of the ſame natures and properties, differing only in degree, inſomuch as many ſpecies of animals have no gall-bladder, and therefore are only furniſhed with hepatic bile, as amongſt quadrupeds, the <hi>elephant, horſe, aſs,</hi> and <hi>deer;</hi> amongſt birds, the <hi>oſtrich,</hi> whoſe digeſtion is ſo ſtrong, the <hi>ſtork,</hi> and the <hi>pigeon</hi>—not to mention ſome fiſhes.</p>
               <p>The BILE is ſomewhat viſcid; coagulable by heat and alcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hol; of a ſaturated yellow colour, inclining to green, extremely bitter; the ſharpeſt, and moſt ſtimulating of all the circulating humours of the body, neither acid nor alkali when freſh, but ſtrongly inclining to, and quickly ſuſceptible of, putrefaction; and promoting that diſpoſition in any ſubſtances with which it is mixed, if they are capable of it; it mixes readily with water, it flames not in the fire, unleſs it be dried, and then it burns almoſt all away; it is a powerful penetrating ſoap in every reſpect; it diſſolves all gums and reſins, being rubbed with them.</p>
               <p>By theſe properties, when poured upon the alimentary maſh in the duodenum, it muſt effect, <hi>firſt,</hi> a more intimate diſſolution, and mixture of the heterogeneous parts together, as it is readily miſcible with water, and renders oil and oily ſubſtances ſo; <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> though it is not actually an alkali, yet it nearly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es towards it; and muſt diminiſh the aceſcent diſpoſition of the chyle, of which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter, and render it more ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to animal nature, which is alcaleſcent: and <hi>laſtly,</hi> by its ſtimulating power, as it is the moſt acrimonious of all the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal fluids, it, no doubt, helps to excite the periſtaltic motion of the inteſtines, and thereby promote concoction; and, as like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, it is a purgative, which it reſembles not a little, it aſſiſts in the expulſion of the faeces; ſo true is it what Lord Bacon ſays, "<hi>that the bile is the incentive and ſtimulus of many functions of the body.</hi>"</p>
               <p>The PANCREAS, or SWEET-BREAD, ſo called, is a long, whitiſh, tender, and friable glandular maſs, ſituated behind the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028021_0033_0FD67029EFE5D740"/>
ſtomach and ſpleen, under the liver. Beginning at the ſpleen on the left ſide, it ſtretches tranſverſely acroſs the vertebrae, and with its other extremity, is connected with the duodenum. In the human adult, it is about ſeven or eight inches long, and one or more thick; its end at the ſpleen is ſmalleſt, and it grows gradually broader, at it approaches to the duodenum, where it terminates: it hath arteries from the coeliac; its veins run into the ſplenic vein, which opens into the vena portarum; its nerves come from the par vagnum, and as they are but ſmall, it hath, like the liver, but ſmall ſenſation: its ſtructure conſiſts of ſmall round acini or glandular ſhoots, connected together with much cellular texture; from each of theſe, there is a ſmall duct ſent out towards the middle; all theſe ducts open into the principal duct, which runs along its axis all its length, and opens into the duodenum, five or ſix inches from the pylorus, or lower orifice of the ſtomach, at the ſame place with the biliary duct.</p>
               <p>As the ſtructure of the pancreas is the ſame with the ſalivary glands, ſo its juice perfectly reſembles the ſaliva in every proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—and therefore may be preſumed to have the ſame uſe—to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, open, and diſſolve the alimentary maſh, and render the chyle, to be made out of it, more ſimilar to animal nature; as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably larger than all the ſalivary glands put together, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in a warmer place, its juice muſt far exceed the ſaliva in quantity. It is propelled into the inteſtine by the common im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus and courſe of circulation, aſſiſted by the preſſure of the adjacent parts upon it in breathing: It is poured into the gut at the ſame place with the biliary duct, that it may be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixed with, in order to temper and dilute, the bile, which is both thicker and ſharper than itſelf.</p>
               <p>The OMENTUM, or CAWL, is a broad membrane, thin and tranſparent, tender, and eaſily torn, ariſing from the anterior and inferior border of the ſtomach, and falling down commonly as low as the navel, ſometimes much lower; then doubling backwards and upwards, is connected with the inteſtine called the colon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtomach, thus forming an empty bag. Beſides, its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal connection with the ſtomach and colon, it is likewiſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the duodenum, to the ſpleen, pancreas, and meſentery; it lies immediately under the peritoneum forwards. being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of its cellular part, and covers part of the ſtomach, and the greateſt part of the anterior ſurface of the inteſtines.</p>
               <p>It is every where a double membrane—but every portion of the thin membrane, by itſelf, may be divided into two thinner membranes or ſloughs, which are joined together by a thin cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lular texture, in the cells of which fat is depoſited: the ſecretion here is performed in the moſt ſimple manner, their being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028021_0034_0FD66FF96776C880"/>
apparatus beſides arteries, veins, and pinguidinous ducts, leading to the cells, or veſicles. The fat is diſtributed in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum very unequally, being in ſome places thin and tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in others an inch thick in fat; in corpulent perſons it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a vaſt quantity of fat; it hath its arteries from the coeliac; its veins terminate chiefly in the ſplenic branch, and all of them ultimately in the vena portarum.</p>
               <p>The uſes of the omentum are, <hi>firſt,</hi> to interpoſe between the peritoneum and the inteſtines, and part of the ſtomach—that all three parts may be preſerved warm, moiſt, and ſlippery, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from growing together: and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> to furniſh oily mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the bile.</p>
               <p>The SPLEEN is ſituated in the left hypochondre, that is, under the cartilages of the left ſhort ribs; it is connected with the colon, ſtomach, left kidney, and by its upper part with the diaphragm; its ſituation is changed by the fulneſs or emptineſs of the ſtomach; it follows the motion of the diaphragm, and is affected by the inflation or ſubſidence of the colon. In general it is placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and backwards from about the middle of the ſhort ribs on the left ſide; in its natural and ſound ſtate, it is about ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inches long, about three in breadth, and one in thickneſs, of an irregular and ſomewhat oval figure, and of a dark livid colour; it receives arteries from the coeliac, theſe entering its ſubſtance, are divided into innumerable branches, and by their evaneſcent extremities terminate in minute veins, forming, by their union, the ſplenic vein, which flows into the vena portarum. The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the ſpleen are very large in proportion to its bulk, and yet it hath no excretory canal but its vein; its nerves are ſmall and few.</p>
               <p>As the ſubſtance of the ſpleen is entirely vaſcular, with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cellular texture to ſupport the veſſels and keep them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; its chief uſe has been conſidered to conſiſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>As we conſider the OESOPHAGUS and STOMACH continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the ſame tube, we ſhall proceed to deſcribe them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and afterwards make ſome obſervations on the inteſtines.</p>
               <p>The OESOPHAGUS, or GULLET, begins at, or is continued with the PHARYNX or THROAT, runs down along the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part of the thorax, behind the wind-pipe, and moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſomewhat to its left, paſſes through the diaphragm, and a ſhort
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028021_0035_0FD6702C35443B00"/>
way under it opens into the ſtomach, into which it conveys the aliments; it is made up of ſeveral membranes or coats: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal one is cellular—next to that is the muſcular coat, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two pretty ſtrong plains of fibres, the exterior of which are nearly longitudinal, the anterior nearly circular. When the former act, they ſhorten and widen the tube—thus fitting it to receive aliment; when the latter exert themſelves, they render it narrower and longer, and propel the aliment onwards: this alternate action, begun at the origin of the canal, and continued downwards ſucceſſively through its different portions, one after another, determines the rout of the aliment into the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>Its innermoſt coat, called nervous, is tough and ſtrong, fit to reſiſt the hardneſs and roughneſs of what may be ſwallowed; it is lined with ſhort villi, ſtanding up like velvet, ſomewhat in the manner of thoſe of the ſtomach and inteſtines, of which we ſhall preſently ſpeak. There are likewiſe numerous ſecretory ducts opening into it, which yield a mucous liquid, by which it is moiſtened and lubricated, in order to facilitate the paſſage of the aliment through its cavity.</p>
               <p>The STOMACH, or VENTRICLE, is ſituated in the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or lower belly, immediately under the liver, which covers a great part of it above, and laterally; it is placed tranſverſely, in the main, from right to left, but ſomewhat obliquely, ſo that its left or upper orifice, called cardia, which is continued to the oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, lies more towards the vetebrae; and the right or lower, called pylorus, which opens into the inteſtine duodenum, more anterior. In figure it reſembles a bag-pipe; its thickeſt part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its left extremity, at the implantation of the oeſophagus, from which it tapers to the pylorus. The CARTILAGO ENSIFOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIS, or lower part of the breaſt bone, anſwers nearly to its mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: the ſpleen lies contiguous to its lower part, on the left, and the pancreas behind its bottom.</p>
               <p>The ſtructure of the ſtomach is in general the ſame as the oeſophagus, of which it may be conſidered a dilatation. Its moſt external membrane is a continuation of the peritoneum; its next is cellular, in which its great branches of blood veſſels and nerves run; in it there are likewiſe conglobate glands and lymphatic veſſels. Under this lies the muſcular coat—the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior layer is a continuation of the longitudinal fibres of the oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus, which open and diſperſe themſelves over the ſtomach—and as the ſtomach is by much the larger of the two, and of an irregular figure, they muſt of courſe be thinner, and leſs nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in ſome places than others. They run moſtly along the length of the ſtomach, and terminate at the pylorus; they ſeem to ſhorten the ſtomach, though but in a feeble manner, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028021_0036_0FD66FFAAE851E60"/>
widen its middle. The other ſtratum or layer, anſwering to the circular fibres of the oeſophagus, is by much the ſtronger of the two; its fibres run in a general way round the ſtomach, at right angles with its axis, though with conſiderable and intricate deviations: they ſeem like the analogous ſtratum in the oeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagus, to lengthen the tube they encircle, and contract its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, a remarkable plain of this ſame ſtratum runs from the left orifice to the right by the ſhorteſt way, <abbr>viz.</abbr> along the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and leſſer curvature of the ſtomach; and appears to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract its other fibres, by drawing the two orifices towards each other. And it is obſerved, that at the entry of the oeſophagus into the ſtomach, the circular fibres are remarkably thick and ſtrong, which therefore may ſerve, in ſome meaſure, as a ſphincter to it, to ſhuts its cavity there; but, upon the whole, the exact courſe of the muſcular fibres of the ſtomach is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to be traced and deſcribed, that hardly any two anatomiſts, unleſs they copy from one another, agree in their account of them. It is ſufficient to conceive them to be ſo fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and diſtributed, as to enable the ſtomach to preſs upon its contents every way, and gradually to expel them.—Next to, and immediately under the muſcular coat, is another cellular texture, more conſpicuous than the exterior one, in which pretty large trunks of blood veſſels and nerves run, after having penetrated through the muſcular coat. Under it lies that called nervous which is a firm, tough, white, and pretty thick membrane, conſtituting the principal and moſt peculiar coat of the ſtomach. The ſixth in number is another cellular web, much thinner and more ſubtile than the two former—made up of ſhorter threads and laminoe—The innermoſt of all is the villous coat, ſo called, becauſe it hath villi, or pile like that of velvet, ſtanding out from it; theſe villi are ſmall membranous productions, or ſheaths containing minute tubuli, both of the arterial and venous kind, opening into the cavity of the ſtomach. The arterial tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli pour into the ſtomach a liquor much more ſubtile than blood, to be mixed with the aliments for the purpoſe of digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—and when the ſtomach is empty, this liquor growing ſharper concurs with the ſaliva in exciting the ſenſe of hunger, as has been ſaid; the venous tubuli are abſorbent, and reſorb liquids from the ſtomach; the innermoſt or villous coat being larger than the reſt, forms wrinkles here and there, more or leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, but at the pylorus there is a remarkable one; where a duplicature of the coat formed by this wrinkle all round the pylorus, and projecting into the entry of the duodenum, ſerves, together with the circular fibres of the muſcular coat, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028021_0037_0FD6702DBA53BF58"/>
and almoſt ſhut that orifice, and let only the thinner parts of the alimentary maſh be expelled out of the ſtomach into the inteſtine very gradually, and in ſmall quantities at once; over all the inſide of the villous coat, there open excretory ducts of mucous glands, ſeated in the ſecond cellular membrane, which furniſh a lubricating liquor, as in the oeſophagus, ſerving to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the acutely ſentient inſide of the ſtomach from the acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or otherwiſe hurtful qualities of what we may eat or drink.</p>
               <p>The ſtomach is plentifully furniſhed with blood veſſels; its arteries all come from the coeliac, and its veins all empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the vena portarum: it is no leſs largely ſupplied with nerves, every branch of which ariſe from the par vagnum.</p>
               <p>Now the uſe of this organ is for the digeſtion of our food, in order to promote the nouriſhment of the other parts of the body, as well as itſelf—and this it is ſuppoſed to promote by heat, moiſture, agitation, and fermentation—all which, that it is capable of producing, it will be eaſy to conceive, when we conſider its ſtructure and ſituation—for we find it is almoſt covered with the liver, lies contiguous to the ſpleen and pancreas—is poſſeſſed of a muſcular coat—has large trunks of blood veſſels running thro' its ſubſtances—lies cloſe under the diaphragm—and fluids pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely excreted into its cavity, and perpetually preſſing down the oeſophagus—beſides its lying over the aorta, or great artery of the machine—and thus the texture of the aliment is broken, the juices they afford ſet at liberty, mixed with the gaſtric juices, or thoſe of the ſtomach, thrown into a ſtate of fermentation, and changed into materials proper for forming nutritious fluids, as far as the firſt proceſs extends—which are farther perfected when they paſs into the inteſtines, whoſe ſtructure is ſimilar to that of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach—by being mixed with bile, pancreatic, and inteſtinal fluids; converting them into a white liquor called chyle, which is abſorbed by the lacteal veſſels, and there in their paſſage through the lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic glands to the receptaculum chyli further mixed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with lymph; from this receptaculum the chyle is carried into the vena cava, thrown with the blood into the right auricle of the heart, thence into the right ventricle, which ejects it into the lungs, by the pulmonary artery, in which organ it is further elaborated, thrown from thence into the left auricle and vetricle, and then into the round of the greater circulation, where it meets with freſh attrition; and thus, in a little time, converted into a perfectly nutritive fluid, which is applied to the particular parts for their ſupport as wanted. But the ſtomach, beſides being the inſtrument for performing the firſt proceſs of digeſtion, is poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of another material power, that of promoting sympathic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in the conſtitution. Theſe are ſuch affections as appear

               <p>The DUODENUM is wider than the others—as it received all the maſh expelled out of the ſtomach; which cannot be ſaid of the other guts, ſome part thereof being reſorbed by the way, but chiefly on account of its having, for a great part of its length, from its origin progreſſively, no external tough covering from the meſentery to limit its ſize; it is likewiſe redder and more fleſhy than the jejunum and ileum, its muſcular fibres being thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſtronger. About its middle it receives the duct from the pancreas and liver, called pancreatic and biliary, which paſſing through its coat, obliquely open into it through one orifice; it makes ſeveral curvatures—the moſt conſiderable is that by which it aſcends almoſt perpendicularly ſome way, ſoon after the two ducts open into its cavity, whereby the alimentary maſh muſt needs be ſomewhat retarded in its paſſage through it; and the bile and pancreatic juice the more thoroughly mixed therewith, and with one another; in its beginning, its innermoſt coat is even, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrinkles or furrows, ſuch as are called valvulae conniventes; but in its progreſs, and towards its terminations, it gets many ſuch; which muſt further retard the progreſs of its contents; it is ſupplied with arteries chiefly from the ſame trunk that ſupplies the ſtomach, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the coeliac; ſome lacteals, though but few ariſe from it.</p>
               <p>The JEJUNUM.—It is not eaſy to fix exactly the limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the duodenum, nor ileum, and this gut: one way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing the jejunum from the ileum, and perhaps the beſt, is to call all that jejunum, whoſe circumvolutions are above the umbilicus, or navel; and whoſe cavities are remarkably furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rugae or valvulae conniventes; this will make it about a third ſhorter than the ileum; it is narrower than the duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num; its muſcular fibres are thinner and weaker; it has ſome cluſters of glands, called Peyer's, from their diſcoverer, and ſends forth numerous lacteals.</p>

the lateral foldings are ſupported by the oſſa ilia, above the thigh bones; its ſtructure is much the ſame with that of the jejunum, except that in it the valvulae conniventes decreaſe gradually, both in number and ſize, till at length they diſappear. It hath more of Peyer's glands than the two former, eſpecially about its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and ſends forth extremely numerous lacteal veſſels, the jejunum and it furniſhing almoſt the whole of theſe canals: it is conſiderably longer than the jejunum, and is continued to the firſt of the thick guts called colon. Both the jejunum and ileum are furniſhed with blood veſſels from the meſenterica ſuperior. Theſe ſmall guts are the inſtruments immediately employed in making the chyle: whoſe coats are pretty much the ſame with thoſe of the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>The thick or large guts are alſo three in number—the CAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUM, COLON, and RECTUM.</p>
               <p>The ileum, the laſt of the ſmall guts, terminating near the right kidney, opens into the colon; at its junction with the CAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUM: this is a ſhort wide ſac about three inches long; its diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about thrice as large as that of the ſmall inteſtines: it is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated under the right kidney, and hid by the laſt convolution of the ileum, and has an appendix ariſing laterally from its bottom, called appendicula vermiformis, and is about the ſame length, but very ſlender, its diameter commonly not exceeding a quarter of an inch; its termination is ſhut, and it fluctuates looſe.</p>
               <p>The COLON from its origin makes a large turn upwards as far as the liver; then proceeds tranſverſely to the left under the gall-bladder, which it touches under the bottom of the ſtomach, towards the ſpleen and leſt kidney, to which it is faſtened; from thence paſſing, it makes ſeveral turns, the whole of them pretty much in the figure of a capital S inverted, then terminates in the rectum; ſo that it ſurrounds, in a manner, the whole abdomen, ſometimes aſcending, ſometimes deſcending; hence it happens that one ſtool is often ſucceeded by a ſecond: by this contrivance likewiſe the faeces are longer kept, and hindered from being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now and then indecently voided.</p>
               <p>The RECTUM or STRAIGHT GUT, ſo called becauſe its courſe, if the length of the body is regarded, is ſtraight, though it is bent backwards and forwards, humouring the direction of the os ſacrum and os coccygis, bones ſituated at the lower part of the back, begins where the laſt curvatures of the colon end, and is terminated at the anus.</p>
               <p>It is worthy to be obſerved, that there is a remarkable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance at the junction of the ileum with the colon and caecum, by which the contents of the ſmall inteſtines are allowed a free paſſage into the thick ones, but ſmall regreſs or retropulſion from

the latter into the former is effectually hindered and ſtopped, this is called, valvuli Bauhini—Tulpii, or—Coli. Its effect in the animal oeconomy is very ſalutary; for as the contents of the inteſtines begin to putrify, and become foetid in the caecum, by their being retarded there, both upon account of its capaciouſneſs, and the almoſt perpendicular aſcent of the colon, which is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from it, if their repulſion into the ileum was not effectually hindered, the chyle in the ſmall guts would be tainted with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridity, and even excrementitious matter thrown up at the mouth in obſtinate coſtiveneſs; whereas not ſo much as a faecal halitus, or the ſubtileſt effluvia, can get that way in a ſtate of health, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The caecum being much wider than the ſmall inteſtines, and at the ſame time lower than the implantation of the ileum, the contents muſt, in ſome meaſure, ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nate there, eſpecially as the colon from its origin mounts in a manner perpendicularly as far as the liver in the right hypochondre. By ſtagnating in ſo warm a place, their putridity increaſes there, and they acquire a faecal odour, which is not obſerved in the contents of the ſmall guts; they likewiſe become leſs fluid, and more conſiſtent, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorption of the more liquid parts through the lacteals and other bibulous veins, ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>The vermicular appendix of the caecum, by the numerous glandular outlets in its cavity, ſerves, as well as a receptacle for the meconium in the foetus, to lubricate the contents and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the caecum, into which it opens, as well as its own, in order to facilitate the propu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ion of the faecal matter, and prevent its adheſion to the coats of the caecum and its own, and where it muſt ſtagnate longer than it had ſtagnated hitherto any where in the inteſtinal tract. This uſe likewiſe takes place in the born animal; and beſides in obſtinate coſtiveneſs, by affording more room or ſtowage for the congeſted faeces it renders that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint more eaſy to be borne, and leſs detrimental than it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might be.</p>
               <p>The caecum and colon, beſides having a ſtronger muſcular coat than the ſmall inteſtines, are furniſhed with three ligament-like bands, running length-ways on their outſide, dividing their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face into three portions, nearly equal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Though they appear like ligaments externally, they are made up in their inner ſtructure of true muſcular fibres, and ſtrengthen the longitudinal fibres of the muſcular coat; as they are longer than the proper coats, they keep them drawn up into folds or wrinkles.</p>
               <p>Through theſe inteſtines is propelled and urged on the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the alimentary maſh, after having undergone the action of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028021_0041_0FD67034A468F7F8"/>
the ſmall guts; it conſiſts of the earthy part of the materials tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in for food—of the membranous, fibrous, cartilaginous, and bony parts, that could not be ſufficiently broken, and comminut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſtomach or inteſtines ſo as to be taken up by the lacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and other abſorbing veſſels; the recrements of the bile, and mucus furniſhed by Peyer's glands, all mixed together.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of its propulſion are the ſame as in the ſmall guts, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the action of reſpiration, and the periſtaltic motion of the inteſtines themſelves; but its courſe is ſlower than in the ſmall guts, upon the account of its thicker conſiſtence, the aſcent and windings of the colon, the delay it meets with from furrows within the tube, and the great ſtop from hard faeces, pent up in the rectum by the ſphincter ani. The putridity is increaſed as it goes on; and as putrefaction generates air, the colon is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found diſtended with flatulency. The whole is more and more gradually exhauſted and robbed of its moſt fluid parts; and as what putrid miaſmata are abſorbed by the meſocolic veins, are determined finally into the vena portarum, to contribute towards the rancidity and putreſcent diſpoſition of the bile, ſo that even here the faeces, which are upon the point of being expelled out of the body altogether, are rendered uſeful and made ſubſervient to the perfection of what is left behind.</p>
               <p>The RECTUM begins in the pelvis where the laſt curvatures of the colon end; its muſcular coat is much ſtronger than in the other inteſtines; the ligament-like bands, which in the caecum and colon are collected into three portions, are ſpread equally over its ſurface, that no part of it may be weaker than another, leſt it ſhould give way in the effort of throwing out its contents. Into this inteſtine the faecal matter, now conſiſtent and ſhaped by the cylindrical cavity of the colon, eſpecially in its laſt curva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where it is more uniform, and not ſo much diſtended by flatulency, is received and accumulated therein, until, by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed bulk, weight, and acrimony, it becomes troubleſome, and would prove hurtful if long retained. Then it is expelled by the muſcular powers furniſhed for that purpoſe—and ſtrong powers there are and admirably fitted to anſwer their end.</p>
               <p>The INTESTINES are not left to move at random in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the abdomen, but artfully tied down by a membranous web, which prevents their circumvolutions from being entangled in each other—at the ſame time allowing them a gentle but limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed motion. That part of it, which is connected with the ſmall inteſtines, is called meſentery; the other part faſtened to the colon, meſo-colon. The rectum has a particular membrane al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to itſelf for fixing it.</p>
               <p>This membranous web, for the meſentery, and meſo-colon
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028021_0042_0FD67000FA4F2B78"/>
are one continued membrane, is a double production of the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneum, ariſing from the vertebrae of the loins; its two laminae are joined together by a cellular texture, in which the lacteals, blood veſſels, &amp;c. run, and the meſenteric glands are placed: when this double membrane hath arrived at the inteſtines, its laminae ſeparate and quite ſurround them, thus furniſhing their external covering.</p>
               <p>Upon a ſlight ſurvey of the uſes produced by the mechaniſm of this part of the human machine, we cannot avoid being ſtruck with wonder at its apparent ſimplicity, anſwering ſo many ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary purpoſes. If we trace the materials thrown into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach for our ſupport through the inteſtinal tube, we muſt more and more admire the excellency of the divine workmanſhip; for as ſoon as we take our food it is received into a place, in all points calculated to render it fit for yielding its nutritious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, by mixing with the ſalivary and gaſtric juices—having its texture broken by muſcular action, not only of its own coats but the organs of reſpiration, and the quickly repeated ſhocks of the largeſt artery in the human machine, and from heat, increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its ſituation, ſoon thrown into the proceſs of fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—by all which it is rendered fluxile, and paſſes, from the contrivance at the lower orifice of the ſtomach, ſlowly into the head of the firſt of the inteſtines—more capacious than its infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part; it is there mixed with the bile, increaſed in its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in proportion only as it is wanted, by the very means of thoſe things which require it, and pancreatic juice, calculated to convert the various portions into a nutritious fluid, by mixing the parts uniformly together, at the ſame time affording a ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus to promote the propulſive force of the inteſtines, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently increaſe the action of thoſe veſſels implanted in the ſides of them to convey it through the meſenteric glands, where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives more liquid, thinner than itſelf, to increaſe its fluxility into the receptacle appropriated for this purpoſe, and from thence into the blood—the faeculent, or thicker part, being at the ſame time puſhed forwards into the larger bowels, from whence there can happen no regurgitation of any, even of its finer parts, tho' delayed for ſome time, in order that a portion of its alkaleſcent or ſtimulating materials may be carried through the vena porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, into the liver, to increaſe the acrimony of the bile; and as here the faeces acquire a greater hardneſs, conſequently ſtand in need of a greater force to propel them forwards for their exit, the bowels in this place are poſſeſſed of greater ſtrength, and require a ſtronger ſtimulus to excite them to more powerful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the putreſcent ſtate of the faeces, acquired by delay, affords.</p>

But beſides the uſes, herein ſpecified, appropriated to the ſtomach and inteſtines, there is another very conſiderable one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them, particularly the former, by which very material affections are diffuſed to almoſt every part of the machine, and from which all the ſenſible parts of the body receive very peculiar and extraordinary advantages—I mean that of conveying action to different parts, and feeling the effects from theſe ſympathetic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and inſtantaneouſly;—for in many caſes the ſtomach not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will experience perceptible effects locally of things received into its cavity, but communicate effect to different parts from that local action; nay, will produce them ſometimes without the animal being ſenſible of any action going forwards in that organ; and will itſelf be affected by ſome cauſes acting on other different parts, with the ſame unconſciouſneſs of the locality of action, as well as ſenſible perception of ſuch action—ſo cloſe an union is there between this organ, and the inteſtines, with various parts, the moſt diſtant as well as the more contiguous.</p>
               <p>Opium, the active preparations of antimony, bark, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe medicines called cordial and antiſpaſmodic, will dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe their effects to the machine in general, and ſome particular parts, from what they exerciſe on the ſtomach, particularly itſelf. Hence will opium produce ſleep—take off pain—promote per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration or ſweat—ſtop evacuations—alleviate and conquer ſome convulſive or ſpaſmodic affections.—Antimonials take off cuticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpaſms, productive of febrile affections, allay febrile heat—promote inſenſible perſpiration and ſweat.—Bark increaſe the tone and ſtrength of the ſyſtems—ſtop ſome evacuations—increaſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers—and give firmneſs to the muſcular fibres.</p>
               <p>Cordials invigorate the habit—increaſe the circulatory powers of the conſtitution—ſubdue lowneſs—fainting—warm the habit—and produce diſcharges from the ſkin.</p>
               <p>Muſk, aſafoetida, camphor—take off ſeveral convulſion affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—and all theſe things are done by the ſtomach, diffuſively communicating effects to the various parts, whoſe office it is to perform their different operations, or to thoſe where theſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid effects may be manifeſted.</p>
               <p>And it will alſo be affected by the ſenſations induced on differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts diſtant from itſelf.

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028021_0044_0FD6700440C2CB30"/>
the courſe of the ſubſequent ſheets.—We muſt now avert to the kidneys.</p>
               <p>The KIDNEYS are two pretty ſolid glandular bodies, ſituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the poſterior part of the cavity of the abdomen, on each ſide of the vertebrae of the loins, between the laſt falſe rib, and the oſſa iliaca or hip bones. The right kidney lies under the great lobe of the liver, the left under the ſpleen, and therefore is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; they are commonly about five inches long, about three broad, and one and a half thick; they are connected with the colon, duodenum, liver, and ſpleen, by the productions of the peritone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. They are in ſhape not unlike a large bean, their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference being convex on one ſide, and concave on the other—the concave ſide is turned towards the vertebrae, or back bone.</p>
               <p>The Kidneys are ſurrounded with a looſe cellular texture, in which there is much fat; this likewiſe inveſts the arteries and veins of the kidneys. The proper coat or membrane of the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys is double, being compoſed of two laminae, or layers—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which there is a very fine cellular texture; the external laminae is very thin, and only ſurrounds the body of the kidney; the internal one penetrates every where by numerous elongations into the ſubſtance of the kidney, from which it cannot be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated without tearing. The ſubſtance of the Kidneys is ſmooth, even, and uniform in adults—in young children divided in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into ſeveral lobes and tubercles, or portions.</p>
               <p>They are ſupplied with very large blood veſſels—commonly called emulgents. The arteries ariſe from the great deſcending artery of the heart, nearly at right angles, one large trunk for each kidney; they run horizontally to the kidneys, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without diviſion—and having ſent off branches to the external ſurface of the kidney, the chief trunk enters into its body at its concave part, and is diſtributed by an infinite number of ſmall branches over all its ſubſtance. The veins running along with the arteries open in a large trunk from each kidney into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va deſcendens, or large deſcending vein, near that part of the aor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta where the arteries ariſe.</p>
               <p>If the kidney is cut through its convex, towards its concave part, into two equal portions, there appears a three-fold ſubſtance compoſing its body—the exterior part called cortical, round the whole circumference of the kidney, of a bright, whitiſh, grey colour;—a middle ſubſtance, called medullary, ſtriated, or ſtreak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which terminates in the third, called papillary, as it ends in eleven or twelve papillae, or nipples, from the ends of which the urine drops through ſeveral ſmall holes in the cavity of the kidney.</p>
               <p>The intimate ſtructure of the kidney is entirely vaſcular—the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028021_0045_0FD67035F5FA8EC8"/>
ſmall arterial branches proceeding towards the papillae are reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back with ſerpentine circumvolutions towards the ſurface of the kidney, then are bent again towards the papillae and, at length, ſend off ſtraight urinary ducts perforating the papillae, and tending to the cavity of the kidney called pelvis, which is continued to the ureter, a veſſel which runs into the bladder.</p>
               <p>The pelvis, which is truly the head of the ureter, is the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir into which the urine drops from all the urinary ducts or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli. It is formed by the confluence of three large urinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, into which the ſmall urinary ducts open by holes laterally. This cavity, or pelvis, is ſtraitened at length into the ureter, one to each kidney; ſo that the kidney may be imagined to be a vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congeries, conſiſting of arteries, uriniferous ducts, or thoſe which convey urine, and veins, all running together over the ſubſtance of the kidney; the urinary ducts opening at length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great urinary reſervoir, or pelvis, which terminates in the ureter. In the kidney there are no follicles between the laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial branches, and the firſt urinary ducts.</p>
               <p>By this apparatus is the urine ſeparated in the ſubſtance of the kidney and ſent into the ureter: the vaſt largeneſs of the emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent arteries, and their proximity or nearneſs to the heart ſhew, that a great quantity of blood comes, in a ſmall ſpace of time, to the kidneys. Now the blood, which is newly come from the heart, muſt contain a great quantity of water, as, beſides our drink, and the ſtomachic and inteſtinal juices, almoſt all the lymph of the body is poured upon the chyle, in its receptacle in the lower belly, and the duct in the thorax, immediately before it is mixed with the blood.</p>
               <p>This water is impregnated with the ſalts of the blood, and ſome animal oil, attenuated by the proceſs of concoction, or digeſtion, and circulation, and rendered miſcible with water, and united with theſe ſalts, together with ſubtle terreſtrious or earthy parts, abraded from the inſide of the animal tubes, conſtitute the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of urine. The diameters of the urinary ducts are adapted to admit theſe, and exclude, in a ſound ſtate, every thing groſſer, as globules of blood, mere oil unattenuated, milk or chyle, and ſerum or lymph, that is concreſcible by fire, urine being not ſo; at the ſame time they tranſmit every thing that is thinner, if it arrives at the kidneys; ſo that urine is the lixivium or ley, as it were, of the blood; by the ſeparation of which it is edulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. Its ſalts and oils, which begin by repeated circulations to be more acrid than the tender veſſels of the nerves and brain could bear, being waſhed off, and thrown out by the urinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages.</p>
               <p>The URETERS, ariſing from the pelvis of the kidneys, run
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028021_0046_0FD6700735BEB290"/>
down obliquely, and with a very ſmall inflexion from the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to the lateral parts of the inner and anterior ſide of the os ſacrum, or lower part of the back, and paſſing between the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum and bladder, are inverted in the latter. Their ſtructure is much a kin to that of the inteſtines, though the innermoſt coat is ſmooth and membranous, furniſhed with glands ſeparating a mucilaginous liquor to defend it againſt the ſharpneſs of the urine; they open into the neck of the bladder on each ſide, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating obliquely through its coats.</p>
               <p>The BLADDER is a membranous and fleſhy ſac or bag, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of contraction and dilatation ſituated in the lower part of the abdomen or belly, immediately behind the joining of thoſe bones, called o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>a pubis—and oppoſite to the beginning of the rectum. The figure of it is nearly a ſhort oval—it is broader on the fore and back, than on the lateral parts, rounder above than below, when contracted; and broader above than below when diſtended. It is conceived, as divided into the body, neck, and bottom, into anterior and poſterior, and into two lateral parts, right and left.</p>
               <p>The upper part is termed its bottom—its neck is part of its lower portion, with reſpect to its ſituation in the body. The bladder is not within the cavity of the peritoneum, that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane only covering a part of its bottom or upper part, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down no farther anteriorly, but being reflected over the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, deſcends, covering it, as far down as the inſertion of the ureters.</p>
               <p>The ſtructure of this organ is nearly the ſame with that of the ureters, <abbr>viz.</abbr> beſides the peritoneum, which covers but part of it, there is firſt an external cellular, under that a muſcular coat; then a ſecond cellular, then a nervous coat, and the innermoſt of all, a coat, in ſome meaſure, villous, furniſhed with glands which ſeparate a mucilaginous liquor, neceſſary to defend it againſt the ſharpneſs of the urine, which ſtagnates within it often, for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable time together.</p>
               <p>The fibres in the muſcular coat run in all manner of directions, the outermoſt, and moſt remarkable ſeries is longitudinal, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the neck upwards, and hath been thought to deſerve a particular name—detruſor urinae, expeller of urine—the others run obliquely, by different degrees of obliquity, and ſome alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether tranſverſe: the neck, or under part of the bladder, is ſhut by a muſcular ſphincter, like that of the anus.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the bladder is to receive the urine which keeps conſtantly ſlowing from the urinary ducts and kidneys into the pelvis and ureter—and to retain it; that it may not indecently dribble, and diſturb the functions of life. It ſeems to change
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028021_0047_0FD67037908F6910"/>
its nature no otherwiſe than by its being kept at reſt in a warm place, thereby becoming more acrid and ſtimulating. The urine is detained in the bladder by its ſphincter, till by its diſtenſion, and the acrimony of the urine, either or both, we are made, uneaſy and endeavour to expel it through the urethra—ſee page 53, 54, &amp;c.—out of the body, which is done in the ſame manner as the faeces are thruſt out—by the joint action of the diaphragm, and the muſcles of the abdomen, aſſiſted by the proper muſcular coat of the bladder—and the pyramidial muſcles, in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, favour the evacuation of the bladder, as they lie nearly over it.</p>
               <p>The UTERUS, or WOMB, the habitation of the foetus, is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated between the urinary bladder, which is placed before it, and the inteſtinum rectum placed behind it. In a grown woman, not with child, it is about three finger breadths long, two in breadth, where it is broadeſt, and one in thickneſs; it is of the figure of a flat flaſk, convex before and behind, with edges inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſharp; its broadeſt extremity, which is called its bottom, is uppermoſt; and its ſmall part, called its cervix or neck, is downwards—it is covered over with a production of the perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum, two portions of which, one on each ſide, faſten it to the ſides of the pelvis, and are called the ligamenta lata, or broad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments.</p>
               <p>The womb, when impregnated, hath but a very ſmall cavity, its walls being very thick; the cavity is, in ſome meaſure, of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular ſhape, and it is lined with a very thin ſmall membrane.</p>
               <p>The womb is made up of a compacted cellular ſubſtance, with a copious intermixture of blood veſſels—there appears ſomething like muſcular fibres amidſt the cellular ſubſtance, eſpecially in women newly delivered, variouſly diſtributed in little circles.</p>
               <p>The ſmaller and lower part of the womb, called its neck or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vix, abounds with callous rugae, or folds; in the interſtices or ſpaces of which there are mucous ſinuſes, and here and there round veſicles full of a pellucid lymph, where it opens into the vagina, deſcribed below; it forms a round protuberance, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the glans penis, called the os uteri, mouth of the womb, or os tincae, becauſe ſuppoſed, like a tench's mouth, divided by a rimae or chink; on which protuberance there is plenty of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, glutinous liquor, furniſhed by numerous ſinuſes there: this glutinous liquor ſerves to ſhut the os uteri in pregnancy.</p>
               <p>The VAGINA, or canal of the uterus, is about ſix or ſeven inches long; it is ſtretched from the mouth of the uterus to the pudendum, or external parts; it is of the ſame texture with the uterus; cellular, with numerous blood veſſels interwoven: its inner ſurface hath ſeveral rugae, or wrinkles; there are likewiſe
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028021_0048_0FD6708190DFBB90"/>
nervous papillae ſpread over it, which render it more ſenſible; its external orifice is ſurrounded with muſcular fibres, which conſtrict it.</p>
               <p>The uterus, as had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The womb is adapted for the retention of the embryo, and its nouriſhnent, till the time of birth; and with the veſſels of the vagina, for affording the monthly evacuation called menſes, or catamenia.</p>
               <p>But to the womb, for the purpoſe of promoting the generation of the human ſpecies, there are united two other contrivances on each ſide, the one called tubae Fallopianae, Fallopian tubes, from the diſcoverer, Fallopius; the other, ovaria, from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſmall round ſubſtances of the nature of eggs.</p>
               <p>On each ſide of the fundus uteri the former open by two ſmall orifices, which in a dead ſubject, with difficulty admit a hog's briſtle; from this ſmall opening each tube proceeds ſomewhat tranſverſely from the fundus towards the lateral parts of the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, running between the duplicatures of the broad ligaments—their diameters gradually augmenting to their extremities, where they are about a quarter of an inch wide; they run not ſtraight from the womb, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut wind in ſuch a manner as to turn their wide, open extremities towards the ovaria; theſe extremities are jagged or ſcollopped; their external membrane, or covering, is from the peritoneum; their proper coat is plentifully furniſhed with veſſels; there are ſome obſcure, ſeemingly muſcular, fibres interſperſed, ſupported by a ſpongy cellular texture.</p>
               <p>The OVARIA are two whitiſh, oval, flat bodies, ſituated on the ſides of the fundus uteri, to which they are joined by a kind of ſhort ligament, and incloſed, together with the tubae Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pianae, in the duplicature of the broad ligament—their ſubſtance is cellular and cloſe, without fat—in it there are found, even in the ovaria of virgins, little round veſicles, called ova, or eggs—of an uncertain number, commonly ten or twelve, full of a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent coagulable fluid. Theſe ova adhere cloſely to the texture of the ovaria.</p>
               <p>The OVARIA and TUBAE Fallopianae, are ſupplied with blood-veſſels from the ſpermatics, which have nearly the ſame origin in females as in males—<abbr>viz.</abbr> the arteries of the aorta, near the riſe of the emulgents, and the veins from the vena cava, and emulgent vein; theſe inoſculate with the veſſels that go to the uterus.</p>
               <p>Theſe alſo are ſuppoſed to perform particular functions in the

propagation and formation of our ſpecies—for the ovaria are ſqueezed by the edges of the tubes, diſengage ſome of the ova, or eggs, which are impregnated, generally one, now and then two, three, or four, which are forced into the tubes and carried into the cavity of the uterus, where they fix themſelves and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and here the foetus is nouriſhed to the proper time for its birth, which happens almoſt always in the ſpace of nine months.</p>
               <p>We might now, according to what we firſt propoſed reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of our ſubject, finiſh our anatomical account, as ſufficient has been deſcribed to give a tolerable idea of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in general; but as we alſo intend to ſhew the methods of preventing, or ſtopping the progreſs of particular complaints, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as well as general—we muſt, before we conclude, ſpeak of the teſtes, urethra, and penis, the male parts of generation—as they are ſubject to ſome complaints which require early atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which ſeveral diſagreeable conſequences may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The TESTES, or TESTICLES, with regard to their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, are ſufficiently known; they are defended from cold, and other injuries, by ſeveral membranes or coats.</p>
               <p>The outer one is called the ſcrotum—which is made up of the epidermis, or ſcarf-ſkin;—the ſkin, and immediately under the latter, a thick cellular texture, cloſely adhering to it, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out muſcular fibres: next under this is what they call <hi>dartos,</hi> from its drawing up the ſkin. This coat envelopes each teſtis ſingly; and by the junction of both together, where their ſides are contiguous, make a partition or ſeptum between the two teſtes: it is likewiſe wholly cellular, without muſcular fibres, and without fat. Under the dartos is the crema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er muſcle, ſo called from ſuſpending the teſticles; there is one to each, and ariſe from the tendon of the obliquus deſcendens, oblique deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſcle of the lower belly; yet ſome fibres from the obliqu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us aſcendens, oblique aſcending muſcle, the embracing the body of teſtes all around, ſerve to raiſe it, and ſqueeze it in the act of generation. It is probable, that by the action of this muſcle, that the ſcrotum is gathered up into rugae by cold, as neither it, nor the dartos, are furniſhed with muſcular fibres. Under this muſcle is another coat of a looſe cellular texture, called vagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, from forming, as it were, a kind of ſheath to the teſtes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which and the innermoſt coat of all is a looſe ſpace, in ſome meaſure like that between the heart and pericardium, where a watery humour is contained—the laſt and innermoſt coat is called, from its whiteneſs, the albuginea; it is a thick, cloſe, ſtrong membrane, immediately contiguous to the kernel of the teſtes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:028021_0050_0FD67084B07C52B0"/>
the ſubſtance of which kernelly part is of a white colour, and from reaſon and analogy, it is concluded to be a continuation of the evaneſcent branches of the artery called ſpermatic, from its ſupplying blood to the teſtes, from whence the ſemen is ſecreted, rolled up together. It is divided into more than twenty portions or cluſters, ſeparated from one another by as many partitions, which are productions of the albuginea. Each cluſter, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between two partitions, terminates in one duct; which ducts, above twenty in number, meeting together, form a kind of net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work adhering to the albuginea; every duct anaſtomoſing with thoſe contiguous with it: from this duct ariſe ten or twelve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtinct ducts, which being ſeparated, bent, or folded in a wonderful manner, make as many vaſcular cones, and by their uniting conſtitute the head or beginning of the epididymis, or ſmall teſticle. This ſingle duct, variouſly bent and folded into ſerpentine windings, ſuch as there is no inſtance of in any other part of the body, its windings being faſtened together by cellu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar texture, makes a roundiſh body on the upper and poſterior part of the teſticle, called epididymis, which, at length, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in a firm and tough cylindrical tube, called vas deferens.</p>
               <p>The PENIS conſiſts of two bodies called corpora ſpongioſa, or cavernoſa, ſpongy or cavernous bodies—part of the urethra, the glans or nut at its extremity, and its integuments. The integu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, firſt the ſcarf-ſkin, and true ſkin—which being folded back, and adhering round the root of the glans, forms what is called the praepuce, in the inſide of which there are ſmall glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar folliculi, which ſeparate an oily ſubſtance, ſerving to make the praepuce ſlip over the glans, and hinder them from growing together: this ſubſtance forms white flakes, and grows rancid and foetid by long ſtagnation. In hot countries, it is more apt to corrupt and create inconveniences, than in temperate climates. This ſeems to have introduced circumciſion, which was early practiſed all over the Eaſt, and made a part of the Jewiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It is performed by cutting off the praepuce quite round, cloſe by the root of the glans.</p>
               <p>Under this common integument, the penis hath a proper coat covering all its body, from the glans excluſive backwards and is of a tough tendinous texture.</p>
               <p>The TWO CORPORA SPONGIOSA ariſe from the os pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis on each ſide, and are continued to the root of the glans: they are ſo called, becauſe they are porous like ſponge, and capable of being enlarged by a fluid penetrating their ſubſtance, chiefly in the living, by blood—or in the dead ſubject, by mercury or inflation of air.</p>
               <p>The URETHRA is a continuation of the neck of the bladder,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028021_0051_0FD6703A6CB0FE88"/>
and runs in a furrow between the two corpora ſpongioſa to the extremity of the glans—it conſiſts of two thick ſpongy membranes, with a ſpongy texture between them—its beginning is covered by glans called PROSTATE—at its emerſion from which, it becomes thicker and wider for the length of an inch, which thick part is called its bulb, from the reſemblance it bears to a bulbous root; its inner membranes are pierced with many holes, here and there, through which, from a glandular apparatus in the ſpongy ſubſtance of the urethra, a mucilaginous liquor is furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſerving to defend it againſt the acrimony of the urine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe orifices, there are three other glands, two near the bulb of the urethra, one on each ſide, about the ſize of a pea; each of which ſends off a long duct which opens into the urethra, and a third ſingle one, leſs than the other two, at its bend under the os pubis—which f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nds off two ducts opening likewiſe into that canal. The firſt two are often found, but ſometimes want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or very ſmall; the third is but ſeldom met with—the orifices are called by ſome lacunae; theſe glands—Cowper's glands; they both, probably, ſerve for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The GLANS is a continuation of the ſpongy ſubſtance of the urethra, reflected over its extremity, and expanded in the form we ſee: it is covered over with a thin epidermis or ſcarf-ſkin, under which there are numerous nervous papillae, rendering it extremely ſenſible.</p>
               <p>The penis is plentifully ſupplied with blood veſſels from the ilia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtic—it might confound, but could not inform: and it is for want of true knowledge in theſe particulars, that men, in other reſpects ſenſible, are ſo often heard delivering a profuſion of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe on medical ſubjects. We therefore, in order to correct er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſo often detrimental in their conſequences, have preſumed to alter the general plan of publications of this ſort; by thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning anatomically—and ſhall now proceed to ſhew the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent conſtitutions—what they are, and how they may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>But, firſt, we muſt take notice of thoſe parts which are called the moving powers, by which all conſtitutional action is promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and life preſerved; and theſe are—the <hi>brain and nerves—the heart, and vaſcular ſyſtem—the lungs and blood—and the muſcular fibres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in proportion to the different degrees of power which theſe poſſeſs in their natural ſtate, ſo may conſtitutions in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral be properly denominated.</p>
               <p>The <hi>brain and nerves</hi> are conſidered as the origin of incitability—that is, motion produced in them by mental affections, and ſympathy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>heart, vaſcular ſyſtem,</hi> and <hi>muſcular fibres,</hi> as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of irritability—that is, motion produced by material ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</p>
               <p>The <hi>lungs and blood,</hi> the ſource from whence all animal heat is derived—the univerſal ſtimulant of the human machine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>muſcles or muſcular fibres,</hi> as the inſtruments of motion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſtomach, inteſtines, and other viſcera,</hi> as parts which may themſelves be acted upon, and produce action of ſome of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral moving powers, and each on parts diſtant from them.</p>
               <p>But we muſt obſerve, that with reſpect to the term, irritability—it is by all authors equally applied to the nervous and vaſcular ſyſtem, as well as muſcular fibres, which we have ſhewn it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to alter, and confine it to the two laſt alone—becauſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the nerves, they cannot be put into motion without ſome material ſtimulus locally applied to them—whilſt the nerves may be brought into action by affections purely mental—the preciſe nature of whoſe action we cannot deſcribe, and know them not but by effects. Beſides, though they are in the habit
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028021_0053_0FD67040C45A5970"/>
united cloſely, they may exiſt independent of each other, and may be ſeparately affected—ſhewing thoſe affections belonging to themſelves, without diſturbing each other in many caſes.</p>
               <p>It was, therefore, unavoidable to ſeparate the two—that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions might be preciſely and diſtinctively marked, where the action of one or the other were moſt prevalent, and hence great confuſion prevented; add to this, it empowers us to account more rationally for ſympathetic affections, that is, where parts diſtant from others, ſhew manifeſt ſigns of affection, though the cauſe producing them lies in ſome more diſtant part; or where affections are ſuddenly produced in the habit, from ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearances out of the habit, no matter being at that time inherent that occaſions theſe affections from the locality of irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But we muſt allow alſo, that the nerves are capable of being put into motion by material ſtimulus.</p>
               <p>Hence then it is clear—that</p>
               <p>The nerves are capable of being brought into action by mental affections, ſympathy, and material ſtimulus, themſelves abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly conſidered.</p>
               <p>The vaſcular ſyſtem, and muſcular fibres, under the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, only by material ſtimulus.</p>
               <p>That in their combined ſtate, they mutually act on each other, in many caſes, or may be ſeparately affected.</p>
               <p>Now as the moving powers vary in their different degrees, and different combinations reſpecting thoſe degrees, ſo do we conclude conſtitutions ought to be determined—and ſo ought different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen, and applications of medicine, be adviſed—for preſerving health, preventing, retarding the progreſs, and curing of diſeaſes.</p>

And theſe have been deduced from the different appearances of the conſtitution—the various effects to which they were prone; the humours conſidered as inherent; and to the affections of particular parts, which they conſtantly, or on ſlight occaſions, experience. But before any benefit can accrue in the application of remedies, or the manner pointed out by which miſchief may be avoided from the ſame ſource, we ſhould be acquainted with the corporeal conſtruction and nature of their powers, which conſtitutes moſt of theſe deviations; and it is for want of this knowledge that ſelf created phyſicians, <hi>doctors of imagination,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion very often a multiplicity of evils to their credulous patients, and to themſelves, under many morbid circumſtances—preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boldly the ſame applications to conſtitutions diametrically oppoſite to each other, and which require very different materials to conquer the ſame complaint.

We muſt, therefore, ſelect our remedies, and appropriate them to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſtitutions; and let our directions be formed, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to diet and conduct, conſiſtent with the ſame conſtitutional points—and more eſpecially where our attempts are levelled at the prevention of morbid attacks; in completing of which we are to aim at keeping the conſtitution in a ſtate of health, ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the powers with which it was originally endowed; ſo that the common cauſes of diſeaſes may not be enabled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their effects; which originate from different qualities and changes of the air; called conſtitutions, climate, morbid effluvia, and intemperance or indiſcretion; under which laſt we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all thoſe actions which, in their regulations, depend upon our own power, or are deduced from neceſſity.</p>

phyſician aſſiſting in the curative operation of nature, ſhould uſe the milder and ſimple diaetetic remedies, rather than thoſe which are very active, and compounded of the pharmaceutic claſs. By diaetetic is to be underſtood, thoſe materials which are taken from ſuch things, as every body requires for the preſervation of health and life, and which are received in the ſchools, under the denomination of non-naturals; for, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as from a wrong or inordinate uſe of theſe, the firſt foundations and proximate origin of diſeaſes ariſe, and alſo have their violence increaſed; ſo nothing is better adapted to expel or ſubdue morbid affections of various kinds, than a proper uſe of them, with a regular mode of living, for without that, nature can do no good in healing, nor medicine produce its deſired effect. Whence the truth of GALEN's aſſertion, That medicine has no efficacious remedy which can bring any permanent aſſiſtance, if the mode of living ſhould reſiſt it, or ſhould not act in conformity, and become an uſeful auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</q> And he ſolemnly aſſerts, <q>That by diaetetic remedies, (in which change of air and climate, proper exerciſe, well adapted meat and drink, alſo a prudent uſe of whey and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral waters, with abſtinence and eaſe are to be included,) he has performed ſuch things in conquering obſtinate chronic diſeaſes, which chiefly had their long and fixed ſeat in the weakened ſyſtem of the nerves, as ſpaſmodic, convulſive, hypochondraic, and hyſteric affections, which others had in vain tried to accompliſh by medicines elegantly compounded, and judiciouſly adminiſtered, and he himſelf had expected from medicines of great fame.</q>

It is a fluid poſſeſſed of ſpecific gravity, elaſticity and tranſparency, and compreſſible—it ſurrounds the earth, and when agitated, or driven in currents, forms wind: it is extremely ſubtile, penetrates, and mingles with every part of the body, and by its elaſtic property, gives an inteſtine motion to all the fluids, and a lively ſpring to all the fibres, which promote circulation; it is never abſolutely pure, but always mixed with heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particles, and that air which we call pure, is ſuch as is not overcharged with any ſteams.</p>

Now theſe properties of the air ſeparately, or by their different combinations, produce many unpleaſant effects on the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—give riſe to and aggravate many ſymptoms in particular complaints—as well as are the origin of many diſeaſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>if the air is too heavy,</hi> it produces inflammatory affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the membranes in the cheſt and lungs, called pleuriſy and peripneumony, head-ach and giddineſs, &amp;c. by preſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurface of the body—obſtructing the pores of the ſkin, hence impeding perſpiration—accelerating the motion of the blood—occaſioning it to crowd on the internal parts, and there circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late too rapidly—hence it is impelled too forcibly upon the lungs, and too copiouſly upon the brain—impeding, indeed, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral functions of thoſe organs which lie remote from the ſurface of the machine.</p>

2. If <hi>it has too much levity,</hi> its elaſticity, is increaſed, and hence produces, by vaſcular diſtenſion retarding the circulation of the blood, and by diminiſhing the reſiſtance of the fluids contained in the pulmonary veſſels, diſcharges of blood from the lungs—hyſteric, and hypochondriacal affections—rheumatiſm—gout, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Should <hi>the air be too hot,</hi> by rarefying the humors, and weakening the fibres, it increaſes the circulation, and augment; perſpiration, in which it is greatly aided by its additional ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus on the vaſcular ſyſtem—whence acrimony is induced in the remaining fluids.</p>
               <p>If <hi>too cold</hi>—local inflammations—as quinſeys, pleuriſies, perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumonies, are brought on by over diſtending the lungs from its gravity—increaſing the tone of the veſſels by conſtringing their fibres—condenſing or thickening the humors—and leſſening per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. And ſhould this ſtate of the air ſuddenly ſucceed too long-continued heat—ardent, bilious, and other fevers are the conſequence—by producing its effects on the conſtitution, where the blood is in too rarefied and acrimonious a ſtate, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors participating of that acrimony with which the ſanguinary maſs is ſo replete.</p>

               <p>From the combination of ſome of theſe different qualities of the air, different affections found their origins.—Coldneſs and moiſture are offenſive, we find, to the conſtitution—but heat, moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and levity, are more pernicious, becauſe theſe, acting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſupply the habit with a putreſcent tendency, from whence many of our moſt dangerous complaints ariſe, as vomiting and purging of acrid bile, called cholera, bilious looſeneſs, malignant fore-throats, and putrid fevers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>purity and impurity of the air</hi> depends upon the greater or ſmaller quantity of heterogeneous particles; theſe are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which belong not to the air in its natural ſtate, which float in it—hence it has, beſides the above evident qualities, others which eſcape detection by the ſenſes, though from their deletri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or miſchievous effects, ſufficiently manifeſt—ſuch are from infections of various kinds—as ſmall-pox, meaſles, ſcarlet fever, &amp;c. malignant effluvia, exhalations, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>With regard, however, to the ſalubrity of the air, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve—that is moſt ſalutary, which is <hi>pure, dry,</hi> and <hi>temperate,</hi> untainted with noxious damps, or putrid effluvia, from any cauſe
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028021_0067_0FD670544878F9D0"/>
whatever; but the ſureſt mark of good air in any place, is from the longevity of its inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The evident marks of a bad, or inſalubrious air in any houſe, are dampneſſes, or diſcolouring of plaiſter or wainſcoat;—moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of bread, wetneſs of ſponge, melting of ſugar, ruſting of braſs or iron, and rotting of furniture:—and nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to render air noxious, load it with putrid ſteams, and breed bad diſtempers, than permitting common and crowded bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial places to be within the precinct, of populous cities; or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of poor people living in uncleanlineſs, collected together in ſmall houſes, or narrow ſtreets.</p>
               <p>Valetudinarians experience the moſt agreeable ſenſations when the wind is weſterly, though when at north, or north eaſt, it is accounted bracing and healthful. Indeed ſo powerful an effect has the influence of the winds, agreeable to the quarters in which they were fixed, been ſuppoſed to have, that it has been aſſerted, our diſpoſitions and tempers are greatly affected by them;—long continued eaſterly winds make people, who are naturally cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, very irritable and moroſe. Nor does our tempers being affected by the different ſtates of air, ſeem at all improbable, inaſmuch as the body and mind are linked together in ſuch cloſe and intimate bonds of union, that they reciprocally affect each other: for as corporeal affections will, we know, alter the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſpoſitions of people—making the placid and ſweet tempered, often petulant and peeviſh—the courageous, timid, fearful, and irreſolute—the moſt patient, reſtleſs and unquiet—the lively and volatile, languid and deſponding—and the moſt active, indolent,—ſo may the air, as it conduces to throw the conſtitution into ſtates nearly morbid, produce, in ſome degree, ſimilar effects—as has been repeatedly experienced by men, not diveſted of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>A weſt wind, in general, is eſteemed the moſt ſalutary—then a north-weſt—after which ſucceeded, in degrees of ſalubrity, in the following order—eaſt, north-eaſt, and laſt, ſouth and ſouth-eaſt—and theſe may be accounted for, from the different qualities of the air, in proportion to the exceſs or deficiency of heat, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, moiſture, dryneſs, weight, or levity—or the different noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or contrary combinations they bring along with them.</p>
               <p>From what has been advanced, the ſituation of our habitations will be a very material conſideration, in conducing to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our health.</p>
               <p>The moſt healthy expoſure, we have been told, in any place fixed for reſidence, is to be found by cutting one of the trees near the place where the houſe is to be built, tranſverſely with a ſaw, then cloſely to obſerve the rings which appear on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028021_0067_0FD670544878F9D0"/>
of the ſection; the ſide of the tree on which the diſtance of the rings from each other is greateſt, is the moſt healthful expoſure. And this is obvious, becauſe there has been the greateſt accre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter by the healthful diſpoſition of thoſe parts ſo made, from always being blown upon by air from the moſt ſalubrious quarter, which it faces, and being hid from that which comes from the oppoſite, which ſeems to produce a different effect—and it is an admitted fact, that in all places, or parts of country, where vegetation is moſt vigorous, manifeſted by the ſtrength and richneſs of the vegetable claſs; there will alſo animals enjoy the ſame conſequences—hence ſhould the windows of the houſe, all other circumſtances being the ſame have a ſimilar aſpect.</p>
               <p>That houſe is conſidered as healthy which is ſituated on riſing ground, or ſide of a hill, and gravelly ſoil, becauſe it is leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to damps and ſtagnant waters, in an open dry country; the rooms ſhould not be ſmall, but rather large—though not cold; the expoſure prudently adapted to the nature of the climate, but ſo contrived, that it may be perflated by the eaſt and north winds, whenever you pleaſe, which ſhould be at leaſt once a day—to blow away animal ſteams, and other noxious vapours;—but the air of the bed-chamber, <hi>eſpecially,</hi> ſhould be pure and untainted, not near the ground, or any kind of dampneſs. We may in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conclude, thoſe ſituations are moſt ſalutary, where theſe different properties of the air commonly attend in degrees of mediocrity, ſteering in a medium between two extremes—nor will it be a ſmall addition, if they are near a river or brook, whoſe ſtream is conſtantly running over a gravelly or ſandy bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom—for ſtanding water is always detrimental.</p>
               <p>The country is more healthy than cities, or large towns, which are populous, from the greater purity of the air, if they are in ſimilar ſituations; but ſome countries are extremely unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, from the noxious vapours with which the air is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated—as thoſe near the marſhes of Eſſex, fens of Cambridge-ſhire, or contiguous to lead mines, and ſmelting houſes; for in grounds cloſe to theſe two latter, animals which graze there are often deſtroyed, and vegetation greatly impeded: indeed the miners, ſmelters, and people in the vicinity, are ſubject to the dry or convulſive colic, and paralytic affections.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal effects of the air—we muſt proceed to examine</p>

               <p>It is moſt probable that our firſt food was of the vegetable claſs, in the ſelection of which, man was directed by experience, led to it from the ſmell and taſte; and the ſupport and increaſe of ſtrength from thence conſequent, would confirm their uſe.

               <p>Theſe truths are demonſtrable, not only by their cauſes, but the appearance of men and animals, who die of hunger—for it is common for them to have an acrid, fetid, offenſive breath; their teeth looſened by corroſive ſaltneſs—violent pain in the ſtomach—acute fevers, and delirium.</p>
               <p>The nutritious part of the food, from animals, conſiſts of a gelatinous lymph;—from vegetables of a farinaceous ſubſtance—in which is a portion of vegetable acid, oil, and ſaccharine or ſugary matter; conſequently, where the digeſtive powers are perfect, thoſe which abound moſt with ſuch matter in their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective claſſes, are the moſt nutritious.</p>

               <p>Notwithſtanding which, it would be extremely improper for men to live alone on animal food; leſt a habit ſhould be induced too full of blood, and too replete with putreſcent juices; creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ferocity, ſcurvy, faetor, leproſy, and all kinds of lixivial cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; as in the caſe among the anthropophagi, or thoſe who feed on human fleſh; all which miſchiefs, by change of diet, and living ſolely on vegetable food, are conquered.</p>
               <p>Hence, in warm conſtitutions, hot climates and ſeaſons of the year, men who are indiſpoſed, as well as thoſe in health, have a greater propenſity to aceſcent vegetables, in proportion as the heat is more or leſs exceſſive; and hence men in very hot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, commonly live on vegetables, ſeldom or not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, on animal diet; but in cold countries, the practice is ſafer, and more free from inconveniences: for this reaſon, bread, or farinous ſubſtances analogous to bread, is univerſally made uſe of; but we ſhould obſerve, that vegetable food, beſides its aceſcent property, is replete with fixed air.</p>

               <head>3. EXERCISE and REST.</head>
               <p>And when we ſpeak of exerciſe, we include that of the mind, with the body; for theſe two are ſo intimately connected, that they produce a variety of effects one on the other.</p>
               <p>To exerciſe, the ancients have, as well as the moderns, indeed ever attributed great utility, particularly in purſuing it with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and have allowed, that great conſtitutional miſchief may be derived from its abuſe or neglect.</p>
               <p>It has with great juſtice been conſidered the ſole inſtrument of the cure of many diſeaſes, eſpecially thoſe of the glandular ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; and SYDENHAM had ſo high an opinion of it, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly riding on horſeback, that he affirms, <q>Mercury for the lues venerea, nor the bark for intermittents, are not more certain ſpecifics, than riding on horſeback for a conſumption;</q> though here he ſeems to be ſanguine in his opinion, and has given too great latitude to the ſalutary effects of this remedy; for, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there are caſes of conſumption where riding becomes injurious—but the conſideration of the ſubject belongs not to this place—we ſhall ſpeak more minutely of it, when we come to give particular directions on that complaint.</p>
               <p>Exerciſe conſiſts in local motion of the body, and that motion more powerful of the limbs. It has been divided into ſerious, and amuſing: that belonging to labour is of the firſt claſs—di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions the ſecond. GALEN hath written pretty copiouſly on the ſubject, and pointed out when it might be ſalubrious, and otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Severe exerciſe, when we exert quick motion, called gymna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic, extenuates the body; the contrary renders it groſs; long continued, diſſipates its moiſture, and occaſions dryneſs; mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate makes it fat. However, well-regulated exerciſe, we find, in general, produces a freedom of circulation, aſſiſts digeſtion, promotes perſpiration, and increaſes glandular ſecretion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; by which mean ſuch as is proportioned to the ſtrength—carried beyond that, it occaſions fatigue, and becomes inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in producing thoſe evil conſequences, it otherwiſe is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated

And this muſt be the caſe, when we conſider the effects produced in the ſyſtem, by that which is judiciouſly adapted; as by increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oſcillatory motion of the veſſels; that is, making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The mind alſo has its influence, for though by its exerciſe it may be made ſtronger—ſtill, if not kept within proper bound it brings on fatigue, and hebetates, or renders the moving powers of the machine inert and dead. Hence the exerciſe intended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>REST is alſo neceſſary to relieve both the mind and body ſuch as is ſufficient to free the veſſels from the ſtronger exertions of their elaſtic force, recruit their ſtrength, and ſet thinking facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at reſt from their labour. But this, if carried to exceſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes indolence, and lays the foundation for thoſe diſorders, which ariſe from inactivity—and this brings on univerſal relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſolids—glandular obſtructions:—enervates the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, vitiates the humors, creates pains in the ſtomach, flatulencies, indigeſtions, &amp;c. and renders the affections of hypochondriac people, and thoſe who are gouty, in a great meaſure incurable.</p>
               <p>From what has been advanced on this ſubject, the ſubſequent deductions may be drawn—</p>
               <p>That EXERCISE and REST may be conſidered <hi>mental</hi> as well as <hi>corporeal;</hi> the FIRST, in moderate, degrees, ſhould be eſteemed <hi>properly ſtimulant, a ſtrengthener of the ſyſtem, promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing digeſtion, circulation, ſecretion, and excretion;</hi> the SECOND, <hi>reſtorative chiefly, but both in extremes, debilitating.</hi>

So ſtrongly do they affect the human machine, that the moſt ſurpriſing conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences have been known to originate from theſe ſources on the corporeal, or ſolid parts, as well as the ſyſtem in general.</p>
               <p>There are innumerable inſtances of fear creating a ſudden and powerful action of the bowels and urinary paſſages. <hi>Fright</hi> has put off a fit of an intermittent, when all remedies had failed; a piſtol fired in the chamber of James the Firſt had this effect, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning alſo a ſudden action of the inteſtinal canal downwards; it has alſo given riſe to an indiſſoluble tumor in a woman's breaſt; <hi>exceſs of joy</hi> has cauſed fainting and ſtupor; <hi>anger,</hi> induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apoplexy and phrenzy.</p>
               <p>We cannot account for the preciſe mode in which theſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for a certainty. Hence, ſays a learned author, <q>We muſt content ourſelves with knowing they are poſitive facts, for, till we are informed by what means the mind and body are united, we cannot even form a probable conjecture, how the operations betwixt them are performed.</q>—In theſe caſes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I think that the peculiar ſtate of the conſtitution, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to its nervous incitability, vaſcular irritability or torpor, renders people more or leſs liable to feel theſe impreſſions, if not

totally, ſtill in a very great degree; for all thoſe, which we call nervous, are more ſubject to manifeſt the action of theſe ſudden or mental affections, than thoſe who have an apparent firmneſs of the nervous ſyſtem, and whoſe veſſels are not ſo irritable as very readily to feel the impulſes of their affections—to me it has appeared to be univerſally the caſe.</p>
               <p>However, with reſpect to the paſſions themſelves, they may be medically reduced to two heads—<hi>volatile</hi> and <hi>ſaturnine;</hi> or <hi>active</hi> and <hi>ſedative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as diſquiſitions of this ſort would lead us more into the field of ſpeculative curioſity, than practical utility, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent myſelf with taking a quotation or two from a judicious wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on this ſubject—and from thence make the application to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the propriety of the diviſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fear, grief, and thoſe paſſions which partake of them—as envy, hatred, malice, revenge, and deſpair, are known by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to weaken the nerves; retard the circular motion of the fluids; hinder perſpiration; impair digeſtion; and often to produce ſpaſms, obſtructions, and hypochondriacal diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and extreme terror has ſometimes brought on death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe I term—<hi>ſaturnine</hi> or <hi>ſedative</hi>—becauſe they affect the nervous ſyſtem in ſuch a manner, as to impede its influence in general—conſequently, the action of all thoſe parts that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon it, and where any of them ſeem to act ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that action is occaſioned more by irritability, or pre-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the part, than from any other cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Moderate joy or anger, on the other hand, and thoſe paſſions and affections of the mind, which partake of their nature—as cheerfulneſs, contentment, hope, virtuous and mutual love, and courage in doing good, invigorate the nerves, accelerate the circulating fluids, promote perſpiration, and aſſiſts digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—but violent anger, which differs from madneſs only in duration, creates bilious, inflammatory, convulſive, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apoplectic diſorders, eſpecially in hot temperaments—and exceſs of joy deſtroys ſleep, and often has fatal and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den effects.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe I term <hi>volatile</hi> or <hi>active</hi>—becauſe they ſo affect the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of the nerves, that they increaſe its influence—conſequently the action of all the parts dependent upon them, which, whilſt moderate, produces ſalutary effects; but when too violent, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary deleterious or dangerous ones, from too great an exceſs of action.</p>
               <p>Hence, though we cannot influence the mind in the particular manner we wiſh always, we ſhould endeavour to raiſe ſuch ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028021_0076_0FD6706242EBB228"/>
as may be productive of thoſe purpoſes, we are deſirous by other means of promoting.</p>
               <p>Where the action of the vaſcular ſyſtem is too violent, we ſhould attempt to inculcate fear—where too torpid, cheerfulneſs; for theſe may in ſome degree, have effects on the moving pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>In treating of the non-naturals, though we have ſpoken of the ſolid aliments by which we are nouriſhed, we have not ſaid any thing of the liquids we in common uſe, we muſt, therefore, in order to render our labour completely uſeful, advert to them, as much benefit is to be derived from a thorough knowledge of their properties and effects, and no ſmall degree of miſchief avoided.</p>
               <p>It is indeed a melancholy conſideration to reflect, that, though health is the only foundation of all pleaſure, and may, by eaſy methods, be preſerved, men ſhould neglect theſe means, which would enable them to purſue their darling Goddeſs through all her varied ſcenes of rational delight; but ſo it is, for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding innumerable authors have written profeſſedly on the dioetetic regimen, from the unwillingneſs valetudinarians have in complying with rules, which lay a reſtraint upon the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their appetites, though calculated to preſerve health, it has been too much neglected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Election treats, Pariſh dinners, Seſſion and City Feaſts, and free luxurious indulgence,</hi> have numbered many with the dead, which proper abſtinence might have preſerved. However, as men will not refrain, but rather become ſlaves to exceſs, duty calls upon us to apprize them of their danger, at leaſt to inform them in what things they may exceed with the leaſt poſſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. In addition, therefore, to what has been already advanced, it appears neceſſary to take a ſurvey of the properties of thoſe liquids we in common drink—which have been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with regard to their powers—as either DILUENT, SHEATHING, NUTRITIVE, STIMU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LANT, ANTISPASMODIC, or SEDATIVE, which in their order we ſhall now attempt to explain.</p>

               <p>Milk when cold loſes ſome of its finer parts, and boiling robs it of more, by more copiouſly diſſipating them: it is demulcent and nutritious, and partakes of a middle nature, between vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and animal, and is apt to curdle on the ſtomach, if it meets with a ſtrong acid, too ſuddenly, or in many febrile diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>To ſome conſtitutions it is perfectly agreeable, creating no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, be the ſtomach in what ſtate it may; ſtill in others it increaſes acidity in the firſt paſſages—it, in ſome, produces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhoea—others it renders coſtive; in ſome it occaſions the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach; in others an uneaſy ſenſation in the ſtomach, and pain—and many cannot enjoy the leaſt eaſe, till it is ejected by vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but where it agrees, no food can be more pleaſant or ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, where it does not increaſe corpulency.

               <p>The milk of an healthful young woman is, to the human frame, infinitely the moſt preferable, ſo is that of any animal to thoſe of their own ſpecies, as more completely finiſhed to their particular nature.—For medical uſe next ſucceed, the milk which has the greateſt affinity with that of woman—in which reſpect theſe are thought to purſue the following order—<hi>aſſes, mares, goats,</hi> that of <hi>ſheep</hi> and <hi>cows.</hi>

Theſe are the chief virtues to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to tea and coffee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The weakening the tone of the ſtomach by frequent uſe—and the ſyſtem in conſequence, inducing tremors and ſpaſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic affections, are the effects of the tea itſelf, though, in ſome meaſure, of the warm water.</q> And, certainly, great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs are done by drinking them too hot—a very common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by very delicate conſtitutions; for, by theſe means, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is brought into too great a ſtate of relaxation—indigeſtion occaſioned—crude chyle thrown too freely into the habit—ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions formed in various parts, and a general ſtate of debility, with a variety of painful conſequences, occaſioned through the whole ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wine, ſpirits, ale, porter, cyder, perry, punch</hi>—may all come under the ſame deſcription with regard to their powers, if we make ſome allowances with reſpect to a few trifling peculiarities which occur; for they all of them are ſtimulants to the ſtomach and ſyſtem in general; poſſeſs ſome antiſpaſmodic powers, and increaſe circulation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Wine</hi> is endowed with ſtronger antiſpaſmodic effects; cyder and perry next; porter and ale the leaſt.

               <p>WINE has for its baſis ſaccharine ſubſtances, of which it is formed by the proceſs of fermentation, which converts the whole, not at once, but progreſſively, into a vinous fluid; one part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unaſſimilated—one is aſſimilated—and one becomes acid.</p>
               <p>Hence wine is compoſed of three parts.</p>
               <p>Muſt, pure wine, and vinegar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muſt,</hi> HIPPOCRATES deſcribes the juice of grapes, recently expreſſed, crude, flatulent—only having one good property, it is aperient; and if it does not act as a laxative, it becomes ſo much the more noxious to the body. It is, perhaps, owing to this that new wines, or other fermentable liquors, drank too early, prove purgative as they generally do.</p>
               <p>Some authors have ſaid, that <hi>muſt</hi> is, properly ſpeaking, what is called <hi>ſweet wines.</hi> It ſhould, with more propriety, be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſomething different, formed by the fermenting proceſs; becauſe, by fermentation of ſugar on the ſtomach, a ſubtile fluid, called by the ſcholiaſts, gas ſylveſtre, and conſidered by them as a fixed, factitious, and fixable air is produced, which acts on the bile, proves laxative, &amp;c. But <hi>muſt</hi> acts in a leſs quantity than ſugar, and therefore muſt be ſomething altered from the ſaccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine ſubſtance, now changed in its properties:—whatever it is, <hi>it deſtroys the tone of the ſtomach—diſpoſes it to ſpaſmodic contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, conſequently, diſturbs and interrupts digeſtion. If aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is produced, it will join with the gas ſylveſtre in weakening the ſtomach—the acid thus formed will unite with the bile, produce a ſtrong ſtimulus—thus occaſion a flow of mere bile to the inteſtines, and cauſe what is called the cholera morbus, a copious evacuation of bile upwards and downwards, with violent ſpaſmodic affections</hi>—but theſe effects are ſeldom produced to ſuch a degree of vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence.</p>
               <p>The active part of the juice of the grape is called ALCHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOL, or <hi>the ſpirit of wine,</hi> but weakened in its action in its compound ſtate. <hi>This exerts itſelf on the nervous ſyſtem, chiefly, if not altogether, by means of the ſtomach; hence it is ſtimulant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing circulation, and the force of the nervous power univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In large doſes—ALCHOHOL DESTROYS THE MOBILITY OF THE NERVOUS POWER—WHENCE, FROM ITS STIMULANT AND SEDA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE EFFECTS—<hi>confuſion of ideas and delirium;</hi> STILL REPEAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028021_0082_0FD6706D70F9BC28"/>
                  <hi>the nervous flow is arreſted—voluntary and involuntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deſtroyed—ſleep, lethargy, apoplexy,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>In WINE, the effects are almoſt never ſo rapid, on account of their dilute ſtate, and ſmall doſes in which the alchohol is throws in; on which account it proves only more ſtimulant and exhili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating—it may produce ſtupor, but as it is apt to be rejected by the ſtomach, and by other matters with which it is mixed, the powers of alchohol is moderated.</p>
               <p>PUNCH, which is only an artificial wine, is leſs noxious than alchohol and water, though more ſo than wine.</p>
               <p>Though an acid is evolved, and enters into the compoſition of wine, and alchohol, ſtill another, and more copious and ſeparate, is formed—which is</p>
               <p>VINEGAR.—This commonly contains ſome ſugar, <hi>may be laxative—have the effects of unconverted ſweet wine—generate gas ſylveſtre,</hi> that ſubtile fluid; and, <hi>in ſhort, have all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of freſh juices:</hi> when thoroughly converted, <hi>it determines other vegetable juices to aceſcency—weakens the ſtomach—prove ſpaſmodic—and has all the conſequences of acids there generated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But combined with wine, theſe qualities are more innocent; as the action of muſt, alchohol, and vinegar, ſeparately may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent each other's ſimple and deleterious effects; and alſo the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may, in the proportion in which it is mixed, have its efficacy in weakening the properties of the other component parts.</p>
               <p>CYDER and PERRY may be conſidered as having the ſame properties, though in much leſs degree than wine, with regard to their ſtimulant and ſedative effects; but are more replete with aceſcency—generate too great degrees of flatulency, run quicker into the acetous fermentation, and produce uneaſy gripings, and more painful ſenſations of the bowels, beſides being more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of calculous complaints, and the convulſive colic; or dry belly-ach, terminating often in palſy.</p>
               <p>From this review we can eaſily judge of the effects, whether advantageous or otherwiſe, which are likely to enſue from wine, and alſo from the different compoſitions ſold by our retail ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and wine merchants, under that title; which produce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable conſequences to thoſe who drink freely of it—laying the foundation for a variety of dangerous, lingering, and fatal complaints. In order to ſhew which, we have been at the pains of going more minutely into this ſubject, that we might explain the particular parts of which wine was compoſed—declare the properties of them ſeparately—manifeſt what were ſalutary, what otherwiſe; as alſo the neceſſity of a proper combination to form their utility; and hence be enabled to diſcover how the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028021_0083_0FD6706F54A88748"/>
poiſonous compoſitions, ſold under that appellation, muſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably produce their baneful effects; for theſe are made of the unfermented juices of ſome vegetables—ſweet raiſin wine, cyder, and Britiſh ſpirits; and this jumble is coloured with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients agreeable to the wines intended to be imitated—with the addition, ſometimes of a ſmall portion of wine, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that noxious material called ſugar of lead, or lead itſelf, forming this ſubſtance by the union with a portion of acid they contain. Now compounds like theſe muſt be replete with thoſe miſchiefs which we have enumerated under <hi>muſt</hi> and <hi>vinegar</hi>—and others brought on by the ſedative aſtringent powers, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by preparations of lead—rendering the action of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and inteſtines torpid, relaxing theſe organs, obſtructing the exit of materials which ought to be thrown out of the body—filling the machine full of crude and acid humors—contaminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole maſs of fluid—and preventing digeſtion, that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of almoſt all chronic diſeaſes. When we, therefore, ſpeak of wine, we would not be underſtood to mean theſe baneful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds; but that which is pure, as can be imported, which MACKENZIE ſays, <q>is an admirable liquor, and, uſed in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate quantity, anſwers many purpoſes of health; and beer, well brewed, light, of a proper ſtrength and age, if we except water and wine, is, perhaps, the moſt ancient and beſt ſort of drink in common uſe among mankind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But with reſpect to wine we may carry the matter further, for it is generally allowed to be the moſt agreeable and powerful cordial we can have recourſe to in the laſt ſtage of ſome fevers, completing of itſelf the cure. In low nervous, and putrid fevers, it is beneficial throughout—when there appear ſymptoms of great debility—and it may be very often taken in large quantity, where the moving powers of the ſyſtem abate much of their ſalutary action, and the fluids ſeem to be running rapidly into a ſtate of putreſcency.</p>
               <p>How much, therefore, is it to be lamented, that we ſhould be deprived of ſo valuable a liquor—replete with ſo many uſeful properties by the avarice of a ſet of beings, who are ſuffered to impoſe upon, and injure the public with impunity, and amaſs fortunes, by ſelling poiſons for our deſtruction, inſtead of wine for our preſervation and recovery of our health. For, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thouſands have fallen devoted victims to this illicit and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous practice. In lieu of theſe, where people are under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of purchaſing wines, rather than depend upon the <hi>worldly integrity</hi> of theſe dealers, I would recommend the wine properly made of raiſins, or the fruits of our own country, they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely

Theſe conſtitutions bear all evacuations well, as they are not apt eaſily to have their ſolids too much relaxed, but are rather prone to become ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoric, from indulgence, which they are apt to run into, from not feeling thoſe effects, which people of different habits ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently experience. They ſhould endeavour to prevent an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs either by abſtinence, or proper evacuations, which they bear in general without inconvenience, though bleeding in theſe is leſs adviſeable than purging, owing to the torpid ſtate of the ſyſtem; and, which, being neglected, ſhould a plethora be the conſequence, ſome of the internal parts of the habit, as the brains, lungs, &amp;c. might be affected by dangerous, or at leaſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome oppreſſions, and we very often find men of this Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for want of timely care, and from indiſcretions, afflicted with ſudden vertigos or giddineſs of the head, coughing, or ſpitting of blood, apoplexy, &amp;c. and theſe are ſometimes of a cold habit, though plethoric, and apt to fall into hypochondriac affections from viſceral accumulations, and languid circulation.</p>

            <div n="3" type="type_of_constitution">
               <head>3. The ſtrong, robuſt, and incitable.</head>
               <p>This Conſtitution ſometimes, though more rarely occurs, and when it does, it generally is united with vaſcular torpidity. In this there is too great incitability of the nervous ſyſtem; and men of this habit are ſubject to a mixture of hyſteric, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac diſeaſes; iraſcible at trifles, deſponding nearly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to melancholy, they are apt to be afflicted with various ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic affections, particularly of the throat, inteſtines, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; ſometimes make profuſe quantities of pale, limpid water; at others, ſmall, but turbid and high coloured; they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently tormented with flatulence, and perplexed with whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and inconſiſtent ideas; the extremities are generally cold, and moving from place to place, or any motion almoſt is performed with languor—moſt of the evacuations are leſſened, or irregular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed; ſleep is imperfect, they are troubled with fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dreams, and are ſubject to the incubus, or what is called the night-mare, and all theſe are derived from the ſame conſtitutional ſources, when torpor attends; for from the want of due power of the muſcular fibres, the circulation of the blood is not carried on with full freedom to the extremities, the internal parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028021_0088_0FD670ABC1DF37B0"/>
are loaded, hence in thoſe parts there is an additional fullneſs and ſtimulus, for the ſtimulus is always in proportion to the quantity of blood flowing to a part or collected in it, from the evolution of the heat, and the ſuperabundance of acrimony, for the fluids of theſe conſtitutions generally abound with acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, particularly ſuch as is productive of the nettle-raſh; hence, then, the internal parts become more ſenſible to the nervous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, conſequently ſolicits it the more freely; and hence ariſes the appearances above enumerated.</p>
               <p>In theſe habits—frictions on the extremities, warm cloathing, warm bath, riding on horſeback, are eſſentially neceſſary; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diet, wine, ſtimulating vegetables ſhould be adhered to, food of eaſy digeſtion, the mind ſhould be kept perfectly at eaſe, cheerful company, change of ſcene, and ſuch amuſements as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the attention, produce a moderate degree of mental hilarity, ſhould be procured; and as for medicines, they ſhould be ſuch, as at the ſame time, that they allay the incitable power of the nervous ſyſtem, diffuſe a general warmth through the habit, and theſe given occaſionally, as aſafoetida, muſk, vitriolic, aether, cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, but all opiates muſt be avoided, becauſe they are apt to render the muſcular fibres too torpid—in general chalybeates may be perſiſted in, and Bath waters ſhould be recommended.</p>
               <p>But where inſtead of torpor, vaſcular irritability is a conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant, beſides being ſubject to inflammatory complaints, and continued febrile affections from ſlight cauſes, they are ſubject to permanent ſpaſmodic affections, ſuch as thoſe which are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by medical men, tetanic complaints, where, when ſpaſms ariſe, the muſcular fibres remain in a fixed ſtate, not contracting and relaxing alternately, nor fugitive as in common convulſions: theſe are liable to be ſeized with a locked jaw, and continued muſcular rigidity. In theſe conſtitutions, warm baths are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly uſeful, gentle and conſtant exerciſe, cooling diet, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious dilution with aqueous liquids, thin aceſcent wines, milk and vegetable diet, evacuations of all kinds ſhould be conſtantly and moderately produced, particularly perſpiration, and the body ſhould never be coſtive; I have ſaid moderately, becauſe in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to abate the irritability of the ſyſtem, we muſt be careful not to increaſe the incitability, which is apt to be the caſe, from evacuations too copious. Opiates are in theſe habits extremely uſeful, and may be freely given under particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. With regard to regimen, what we have ſaid before in the beginning of this ſection may be adhered to, taking eſpecial care to avoid all mental uneaſineſs. Theſe conſtitutions are apt to be plethoric and attended with heat.</p>
               <p>What we have delivered appertains to thoſe who are conſidered
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028021_0089_0FD67075592560C0"/>
to poſſeſs ſtrong degrees of muſcular firmneſs, differently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined. We muſt now proceed to ſuch as have a WEAK, RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAXED, DELICATE HABIT, JOINED WITH TOO GREAT INCITABILITY. And this circumſtance generally occurs in theſe habits, that they have alſo too great a ſhare of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritability. Theſe are ſubject to painful and ſpaſmodic diſeaſes; and the more delicate ſex of this conſtitution are prone to hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric affections from the relaxation and irritability of their habits. They alſo are conſtantly a tacked on every ſlight cold, with ſlow fevers, and have their digeſtive powers loaded with faburra, or different kinds of ill digeſted matters in the ſtomach and bowels, making their way into the habit in this noxious form.</p>
               <p>To theſe, a dry, clear air is eſſentially neceſſary, moderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, particularly riding, cold bathing, and chalybeate waters; animal food eaſy of digeſtion, and free from fat, and a temperate uſe of aſtringent wines. Vegetables ſhould be adminiſtered ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and thoſe of the leſs flatulent kinds; food and liquids, viſcid and tenacious, ſuch as flour puddings, potatoes, oyſters, ſtrong ſoups, and malt liquors, ought to be prohibited. Every thing calculated to ſtrengthen the tone of the ſyſtem, and preſerve it in an equable ſtate ought to be had recourſe to, and all things likely to weaken it muſt be deſiſted from. Cheerful company and moderate amuſements are ſerviceable, but purſued too freely, the reverſe; for all fatigues, both of body and mind, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judical—the cuſtom of taking vegetable acids too copiouſly is alſo pernicious—hot tea, or any thing drank too warm—for theſe all contribute to relax and load the ſtomach and inteſtines, with foul, viſcid materials, which produce therein internal ſtimulus, create flatulence, and communicate general irritability through the ſyſtem. Blood ſhould never be taken from people of this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, but upon the moſt urgent occaſions, and then only ſparingly, in which cupping is preferable to the lancet; and it is ſafer to take it away at two operations, than at one, ſome little diſtance of time from each other, if more than ſix ounces ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. All ſudden changes ſhould be avoided with the utmoſt caution, either with reſpect to cloathing or diet, the mind kept free from anxious cares—hence watering places are uſeful, where thoſe impregnated with chalybeate particles, or iron, may be drank; in fine, every thing ought to be adviſed, which, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree, can exhilirate the ſpirits, and contribute to give ſtrength to the ſolids. Theſe conſtitutions are generally warm, ſubject to irregular fluſhing heats, and have for the moſt part no ſmall degree of acrimony in the habit. But there are ſome who poſſeſs too great a ſhare of torpidity, and then they form that kind.</p>

2. Where a WEAK, RELAXED HABIT IS JOINED WITH A DEFECT OF SENSIBILITY; and theſe are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not only to nervous affections, but to chronic and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſeaſes; for the circulation in all theſe is languid, and the abſorbent ſyſtem acts not with proper freedom. Hence will ariſe thoſe complaints which depend on an acrimonious ſtate of the humors, and an accumulation of the fluids in the whole, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parts of the ſyſtem—as dropſy, jaundice, corpulency, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic complaints, green-ſickneſs ſo called, obſtructed menſes, glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular tumors, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In theſe torpid habits, ſtimulants are uſeful, as alſo are eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuants; to theſe, a dry air and high ſituation are moſt ſuitable, with a generous diet of the more pungent claſs—ſuch as the juices of the older animals, fiſh, muſtard, horſeradiſh, cabbage, and all of that claſs: briſk exerciſe on horſeback, emetics, and frequent purging, in order to ſhake the vaſcular and glandulous ſyſtem, prevent accumulations, remove obſtructions, hinder the bile from ſtagnating, and the mucous fluids from collecting. All the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural evacuations ſhould be kept free from ſuppreſſion, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh which, the ſyſtem ought to be perpetually rouſed to action; hence indolence and indulgence in bed is to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly avoided; the thinner ſtimulating liquids, as white wine diluted with water, ſhould be the common beverage, and the mind kept in a ſtate of cheerful activity, free from all gloomy and deſponding reflections.</p>
               <p>Were the rules here laid down obſerved before our maſs of humours had been contaminated by indiſcretions and various ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of debaucheries, which weaken and diſturb the ſyſtem in its performance of the proper offices alloted to her various parts, perhaps there would be little occaſion to conſider of thoſe things, which are neceſſary to prevent diſeaſes ariſing from a default of the <hi>natural</hi> humors of the machine; but as that is not the caſe, they call upon us for our conſideration, as well as thoſe which are fortuitouſly thrown into the Conſtitution. And thoſe we ſhall divide into ſuch as are firſt,</p>
               <p>NATURAL, And thoſe which are</p>
               <p>ACCIDENTAL. The natural fluids are diviſible into <hi>General,</hi> or <hi>Partial.</hi>

From the too copious ſtate of this fluid, a variety of complaints may ariſe, and, therefore, when ſymptoms of oppreſſion appear from this cauſe, which will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally manifeſt itſelf by languor, a ſenſe of weight or fullneſs in the head, when riſing in the morning from bed, or in ſtooping, and fullneſs alſo of the pulſe; abſtinence, indulging leſs than u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual in ſleep, increaſing the natural evacuations, and uſing more exerciſe, will effectually reduce the body to its proper ſtandard, if theſe things are had recourſe to in due time, and perſevered in for a proper period; the diet ſhould be the leaſt nutritious, more of the vegetable than animal claſs, the laſt eat of ſparingly, confining themſelves to one diſh, and having it only once a day, and water ſhould be the only beverage; but ſhould inanition, or a want of a proper quantity of blood be induced by any cauſe, nutriment ſhould then be given of the moſt quick and eaſy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion—as teas, and broths made of the fleſh of older animals, thin jellies, and the fleſh of the younger animals, as chicken, rabbits, lamb, veal, &amp;c. and in ſuch quantities, though that can be readily converted into chyle—for it is a miſtaken notion, to ſuppoſe the larger the proportion of nutrition thrown into the habit, the ſooner it will be recruited; the reverſe will happen, for by theſe means the digeſtive powers being overloaded, will be weakened, and conſequently even a ſmall portion be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from being properly aſſimilated, or reduced to the nature of our own healthful fluids, which they muſt be before they can anſwer the purpoſes for which they are intended—as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it ſo much is only given as thoſe powers can conquer, they will gain freſh ſtrength every day, by the application of that which has been converted into a nature peculiarly adapted to the end propoſed; and this quantity may be repeated as often as the conſtitution requires it. By this a further waſte will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, which may alſo in this view be aſſiſted by the uſe of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machics, which chiefly conſiſt of bitters—as gentian, orange peel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>PARTIAL.—Where they only affect ſome parts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and are not diffuſive, but produce particular diſeaſes from a peculiar ſpecies of morbific matter; and theſe are either generated in the habit ſpontaneouſly, or ſeem to ariſe from errors in diet, indulgencies, or irregularities with reſpect to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the animal oeconomy; but theſe, if incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eradicated, may be alleviated, and in ſome degree prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The FIRST of which we ſhall mention is the <hi>gout;</hi> reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, though ſo painful, ſo dangerous and common a mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I believe little doubt remains but it may be weakened in its attacks, even in thoſe who have been long ſubject to it, by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; that is, by properly regulating conſtitutions conſiſtent with the powers they poſſeſs: and I am firmly perſuaded it may be prevented from returning in the younger claſs of mankind, would they, on its firſt onſet, preſcribe to themſelves and follow ſuch regulations, as experience has, in many ſimilar caſes, proved to be conducive to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Adhering ſtrictly to a milk diet has in many caſes put a ſtop to returns of the gout; and regularity of living, with proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe—abſtaining from wine and high-ſeaſoned diſhes, pickles,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028021_0094_0FD670AF79A9B800"/>
and other incentives, that ſtimulate the appetite, and occaſion men to overload, and weaken the tone of the ſtomach, and digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers, have rendered this malady infinitely more mild in its paroxyſms. Men, with this propenſity to the gout, ſhould avoid every exceſs that has the leaſt tendency to reduce the habit below the proper ſtandard of health—either in eating, drinking, or venereal enjoyments: for it is by the ſlaviſh and conſtant pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of theſe particulars, and the great indulgence which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelves, that we ſee ſo many martyrs to gouty devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Early riſing, moderate exerciſe, and that daily; bland mild food: abſtinence from inebriating liquids, or a very moderate uſe of them, as alſo of concubinage, will ever be ſucceeded with ſuch conſequences, as will amply repay us for philoſophic for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.—People of this conſtitution ought to refrain from weighty cares—the labours of the mind—much thought, anxiety, and ſolicitude: they ſhould avoid all vexation, particularly as no thing diſpoſes more to bring on fits of the gout, by occaſioning crudity, and indigeſtion, from weakening and rendering the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtomach too torpid.</p>
               <p>Various modes have been recommended for preventing the acceſſions of the gout—but what ſeems to have gained credit from the experience of ſeveral intelligent men, is the uſe of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; of which a drink is made by impregnating water with a proper proportion of it, and this has proved ſalutary, in not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mitigating fits of the gout, but ſome ſay of totally preventing their return. Indeed if we conſider the action of ſulphur on the habit, we ſhall not be averſe to think favourably of its uſe.</p>
               <p>Dr CULLEN ſays, <q>It is certainly a mild and ſafe cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, never producing any conſiderable evacuation, but keeping up the natural excretion by the inteſtines, without any irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or heating effect.</q>—And Dr. LEWIS—<q>That pure ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, in doſes of from ten grains to a dram or more, gently looſens the belly, and promotes perſpiration; it ſeems to paſs through the whole habit, and manifeſtly tranſpires through the ſkin, as appears from the ſulphureous ſmell of thoſe who have taken it, and ſilver being ſtained in their pockets to a blackiſh hue, as by the vapour of ſulphureous ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But we muſt obſerve in this, as in every other conſtitution, we muſt be directed in our ſpecific courſe by the particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the habit, according as it tends to one or the other, which we have before ſpecified. Hence in this caſe we muſt ſometimes enforce an abſtemious regimen altogether from animal food—ſometimes 
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028021_0095_0FD67078C8D26C40"/>
allow its moderate uſe, proportioning the degrees of exerciſe to the degrees of tone, or ſtrength of the ſyſtem, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prohibiting the uſe of wines and other fermented liquors, except in caſes of great debility, or long habit; and preſerving the ſtrength of the ſtomach and digeſtive organs.</p>
               <p>2d. RHEUMATIC.—In theſe, the ſame rules will hold good as in the former, and not be attended with diſſimilar effects, and thoſe very often more certain; for it has ſometimes been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by wearing a flannel ſhirt, which keeps up an increaſed degree of inſenſible perſpiration, and uſing the cold bath or ſea-bathing without interruption.</p>
               <p>3d. That diſeaſe, which in inland countries we ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee affect the natives, called the PUTRID SCURVY—by exerciſe, warm cloathing, drinking aceſcent wines, and living chiefly on freſh vegetables, or eating freely of them, will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. It generally affects thoſe who live on ſea-coaſts, and feed on fiſh, and ſailors:—hence ſour crout has been conſidered as preventive. I have heard captains of ſome ſhips ſay, great benefit has been derived from vinegar, and they give it the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to lemon or lime juice—why, I know not, unleſs from the ſaccharine ſubſtance in vinegar, a degree of fermentation takes place, and affords ſome portion of fixable air, from whence poſſibly ſome antiputreſcent effects may be produced.</p>
               <p>4th. Where we have reaſon to fear a <hi>ſcrophulous</hi> taint, or the ſeeds of that diſeaſe called the <hi>king's evil</hi> predominate in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit—thoſe means exerted, which give ſtrength to the ſolids, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in time, bid fair to act as preventive in this caſe; at leaſt hinder the offenſive matter from producing its unhappy effects in a violent degree.</p>
               <p>Living in a free country air, particularly on the ſea-coaſt, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exerciſe and nutritious diet; moderate uſe of wine and a courſe of gentle chalybeates, or drinking the chalybeate waters once or twice a year, might anſwer the intention.</p>
               <p>5th. Where there is a redundancy of bile, or a collection, thoſe conſtitutions, we have ſaid, are called <hi>bilious,</hi> and have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a bitter taſte in the mouth. The ſtomach and bowels of ſuch ſhould be always kept clear, by taking aperient medicines every now and then, and ſuch as are not likely to leave the body coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive after the operation. In theſe habits, aloes and ſoap are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, caſtor oil, ſaline purgatives—as Glauber or Epſom ſalt, or the natural purging waters—as thoſe of Thorp-Arch—Northaw—Colcheſter—Dulwich—Epſom—Action—and Cheltenham.—Fat and oily ſubſtances ſhould be ſparingly, if at all thrown into the habit. Exerciſe ſhould be perſiſted in, and ſome ſpecies of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028021_0096_0FD670B0F2E57AE0"/>
vegetable food preferred to any other, as the dandelion—endive—and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>6th. The ſtomach and bowels are apt to be loaded with differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds of noxious materials, called <hi>ſaburra</hi>—and theſe are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>acid, rancid,</hi> or <hi>viſcid.</hi> In all conſtitutions that have one or more of theſe particular tendencies, they generally ariſe from weak, digeſtive powers. Emetics and purgatives are now and then to be preſcribed on that account, and thoſe things which give force to the weakened organ.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>acid</hi> is moſt prevalent, which will diſcover itſelf by ſour belchings and heart-burn—animal diet is moſt proper; crude vegetables, milk, butter, and other oleaginous ſubſtances ſhould, be foreborn, and alſo fermented liquors; the moſt proper drink is water alone, or warmed with a little ardent ſpirits, or having ginger infuſed in it—ſtomachic bitters with elixir of vitriol, or bark; abſorbent powders, as hartſhorn burnt and prepared, chalk, magneſia, are uſeful for immediate relief. In all relaxations of the ſtomach we muſt aim at ſtrengthening its tone, preventing fermentation, and promoting the expulſion of its contents;—the alkaline waters, as thoſe of Upminſter, Brentwood, Seltzer, and Tilbury, may be recommended.</p>
               <p>If the eructations ſhould be <hi>rancid,</hi> or occaſion a <hi>putrid, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive taſte;</hi> called nidorous, like that of bad eggs, and nauſea at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, with the throwing up of liquids, that will blaze in the fire like oil, a diet containing a large proportion of aceſcent vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles will be proper, with a very ſparing quantity of butter and oil—made diſhes ſhould not be allowed, nor rich ſauces, or much gravy—acid fruit, ſuch as are ripe may be indulged in, and water is generally the propereſt liquor to drink.</p>
               <p>But if the matter ſhould be <hi>viſcid</hi> and <hi>ropy,</hi> that is there gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated—ſuch things as will aſſiſt in dividing in carrying it off, are the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And in all caſes where the digeſtive powers are too languid, where there is not too great an acrimony of the humors, and the habit is not liable to be heated from ſlight cauſes;—chalybeate waters, ſuch as Pyrmont—Tunbridge—Hampſtead—Iſlington,—and the ſulphureous, as Buxton—Bath—Aix-la-Chapelle—

               <p>But ſometimes the lungs will be ſubject to be loaded with viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid, tough kind of phlegm, in order to prevent which, the mode above laid down will be highly conducive, and what will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much towards being more ſucceſsful—are emetics taken occaſionally.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Beſides what we have above deſcribed, there are fluids which get into the habit from contagion or infection, and will produce diſeaſe by the action of their morbid matter, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, before they have manifeſted their effect—and theſe we call</p>
               <p>ACCIDENTAL.—The FIRST of which we ſhall take notice of, is that creative of the <hi>lues venerea</hi>—or <hi>pox;</hi> and where there is ſtrong ſuſpicion of having had commerce with an infected ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the malady may be prevented by ſuch applications, as will waſh off all the natural mucus of the parts, and thereby carry away the virus, or venereal poiſon, which lies entangled in it; and theſe are ſolutions of the cauſtic alkali; ſoft or common ſoap, corroſive ſublimate, &amp;c. in water, with which the external parts ſhould be well waſhed, as ſoon as may be after coition, at leaſt within the ſpace of ſix or eight hours; and ſome ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected within the urethra; but great care ſhould be taken not to make the ſolution too ſtrong, leſt the parts ſhould be excoriated, and inflammation brought on by that means, with its painful and diſagreeable conſequences. It will be ſufficient if the ſolution is of ſuch a ſtrength only, as will give a ſlight ſenſation of pungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on the tongue or inſide of the lips.</p>
               <p>The SECOND—the <hi>poiſon of the viper.</hi>—The ill conſequences generally attending the bite of vipers, by which means they pour their virus into the wound, and ſo communicate it to the habit, have been prevented, it has been aſſerted, by the immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the fat of that reptile to the wounded part.—It was, in the more early periods, conſidered as a ſpecific in that caſe—but olive oil has been known to anſwer the purpoſe full as effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually.—Theſe means may alſo be uſeful in abating the pain origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating from the ſtings of <hi>waſps—bees—bugs—gnats</hi>—or prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effects from burns, or ſcalds, before the ſkin is raiſed into bliſters; but the more effectual modes are the immediate appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſpirits of hartſhorn, or of ſal ammoniac, or ſpirit of wine, and continued ſome time.</p>
               <p>The THIRD.—The <hi>ſaliva of a mad dog,</hi> or <hi>another mad animal,</hi> communicated by a bite, gives riſe to the moſt dreadful of all human calamities; and its effects, if not prevented, generally terminate fatally: but theſe have been ſaid to be warded off, by

For by theſe means, the poiſon will be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed getting into the habit; and ſhould a portion of it have made its way inwards, by the quick action of the abſorbent veſſels, it might be thrown out, by quickly and conſtantly promoting ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary ſecretions and excretion.</p>
               <p>The FOURTH—The <hi>noxious particles, which by infection oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion malignant ulcers of the throat, putrid fevers, or dyſentery</hi>—and which are generally uſhered in with ſhiverings, ſickneſs, and ſudden loſs of ſtrength, have had all their conſequent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs prevented, by the inſtantaneous exhibition of emetics; and ſhould theſe fail, ſo that the whole ſymptoms do not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go off, a large bliſter applied between the ſhoulders has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly removed them. Nurſes, in the naval hoſpitals, have, it is ſaid, from the moſt undoubted authority, by this mode pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented miſchief.</p>
               <p>The FIFTH, and LAST of which I ſhall take notice in this place, are <hi>the putrid particles, apt to be taken into the habit, by perſons wounding themſelves by diſſecting of putrid bodies, or parts mortified</hi>—and of which many inſtances have recently occurred, where the unfortunate, though praiſe-worthy, curious inquirers, have fallen ſacrifices to the deleterious effects.</p>
               <p>In caſes where, under theſe circumſtances, wounds occur, I ſhould recommend ſucking the part immediately, and having it well waſhed with vinegar; then the application of ſtrong mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ointment, and mercurial purges, taken occaſionally at proper intervals; for I know of no medicines which ſo effectually clear

               <p>Having now delivered fully what may be thought neceſſary for underſtanding the nature of conſtitutions in their ſimple, and mixed general ſtate, and alſo peculiar, with the modes neceſſary to be purſued, in keeping them in an healthful ſtate, or of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting diſeaſes, as far as reſpect theſe particular points; we would obſerve to the young practitioners, or thoſe who thirſt after me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical information, or love to engage in practice from motives of philanthropy, where medical advice may be far diſtant, that the eye ſhould not only be carried to theſe conſtitutional points in caſes where prevention of diſeaſes is ſtudied, but particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſhould be paid to them in diſeaſes, wherein they will be found altered from their natural ſtate, and ſome different combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations taking place from the effects of the malady itſelf; which deviations, when diſcovered, ſhould regulate the conduct; and it will be perceived that medicines highly proper in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a complaint, are as improper in the concluſion, and ſo on the contrary, and this alone owing to the alteration made in the habit: for inſtance, in inflammatory remittent fever, where at the onſet, the conſtitution is poſſeſſed of great firmneſs—ſtrong vaſcular irritability—and equable nervous incitability—to give bark would be madneſs, little leſs than butchery, becauſe it would too much increaſe the already too heightened powers, and occaſion the worſt conſequences: but at the latter end, or during the progreſs in its later ſtage, the ſame is a cure, owing to the conſtitution being altered by the violence of the diſeaſe at this time; for it loſes its firmneſs—increaſes vaſcular weakneſs—and induces too great nervous incitability, all which are conquered by bark augmenting the tone of the ſyſtem. But as we have examined particular conſtitutions in an healthful ſtate, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out their variability, and ſpoken of ſome points neceſſary to be obſerved in our conduct, in order to preſerve them in that ſtate, we ſhall now make the application on a more extenſive ſcale.</p>

But unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, men under theſe circumſtances often plunge themſelves into the oppoſite extremes, by imprudencies and indulgencies; for it muſt be obſerved, that the moſt perfect ſtate of health is not far diſtant from diſeaſe, and very often trifling indiſcretions lay the foundation for great miſchief, if the conſequences occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence are not ſoon put a ſtop to; which, indeed, by a little care and attention, might frequently be prevented;—cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rules for which we ſhall endeavour to point out, which one would ſcarce think neceſſary, if we conſider the latitude given by CELSUS, to thoſe in health, did not experience every day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that the documents he lays down require ſome reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—He ſays, <q>A man, who is healthful, and at his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, ought not to be confined to any particular regimen; as he wants not the advice of a phyſician, his mode of life ſhould be varied;—he ſhould ſometimes reſide in the country ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in cities, but oftener in the former;—he ſhould now and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Though this latitude is given, we muſt obſerve it is only to a man in full vigour of health; but even here, during the ſtate of allowed indulgence, ſome caution becomes neceſſary, eſpecially againſt every ſpecies of exceſs; for it is a known and allowed truth, that exceſs of every kind, whether corporeal or mental, diſorders he human frame, and lays the foundation for a variety of complaints, even in thoſe things, a moderate ſhare of which is neceſſary for the ſupport of our machines—conduces to invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorate our mental powers, and promote our pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> this is an obvious truth, though in the latter it is much ſafer to exceed than the former; in proof of which, let us examine them.</p>
            <p>We find that by drinking a quantity of vinous and ſpirituous liquor, in which all thoſe which cauſe inebriation are included; the vital principles, or that which ſupports life, and renders the machine active, is rendered extremely powerful by the ſtimulus applied partially to the ſtomach, or more diffuſively; the ſpirits are elevated, ſometimes even to madneſs; a more than common ſtreſs is laid upon the conſtitution; the habit becomes fuller ſo long as this ſtimulus continues, and liquor is poured into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; which ſtimulus ceaſing from conſtitutional fatigue, the ſyſtem feels too much loaded and enervated; the ſtomach relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all the vital powers incapacitated to perform their func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions properly; hence pain, ſickneſs, head-ach, languor, or a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary fever, perhaps after a debauch, the whole, or moſt part of theſe inconveniencies are experienced.</p>
            <p>To remedy which, lying in bed and plentiful dilution with watery liquors—as weak tea—ſmall broth—thin gruel, &amp;c. ſhould be perſiſted in, to promote perſpiration; or recourſe ſhould be had to riding on horſeback, by which means the ſuperabundant load will be carried off, and the body reſtored to its proper tone. Either of theſe methods may be purſued, as is moſt agreeable to the conſtitution: the former I ſhould recommend to plethoric habits, and thoſe of a ſtrong ſtamina; the latter to the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed whoſe ſtomach is generally in a weaker ſtate. Sometimes taking plentifully of the following:—One dram and a half of ſalt of tartar, called now prepared kali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> four table ſpoonfuls or five of lemon juice water which has been boiled, half a pint—brandy three or four table ſpoonfuls, and this ſweetened with ſugar; or if the ſtomach is very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, a dram and a half of aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028021_0102_0FD627DDAD70A8F0"/>
confection, or two table ſpoonfuls of tincture of bark may be added;—a tea cup or more of which may be taken often in the day;—or what is better, the ſalt of tartar may be diſſolved in the liquid, without the lemon juice; and after every ſix ſpoonfuls drank, let a table ſpoonful of lemon juice be taken, and this repeated in the ſame manner;—or ſome warm and grateful cordial, as ratifia—uſquebaugh—brandy, mixed with peppermint water, may be adminiſtered, which will give immediate relief to thoſe whoſe ſtomach is affected with nauſea, ſickneſs, or oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a common practice with men devoted to liquor; but this ſhould be had recourſe to only on very particular occaſions, for it is a cuſtom may be attended with diſagreeable conſequences, if too frequently uſed, becauſe the ſtomach, once accuſtomed to any particular ſtimulus, requires the conſtant repetition of that ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus, which, in time, deſtroys its tone, and lays the foundation for thoſe maladies which ariſe from inebriation; and it is this which often induce men to turn drunkards; low ſpirited women, frequently from taking things of this fort to exhilirate their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, are converted into ſhameleſs ſots, and become the diſgrace of their own ſex, and contempt of ours. However, this furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es one proof of the power which the ſtomach contains over the ſyſtem in general; as by the ſtomach being ſtimulated, all that laſſitude—languor—nauſea—ſickneſs—and every uneaſy ſenſation attendant on its relaxation, are removed, except heat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By exceſs in eating,</hi> the ſtomach is apt to be over-diſtended—the digeſtive powers weakened—the veſſels filled with crude chyle—reſpiration retarded; hence a ſenſe of weight at the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach—pain and flatulence—propenſity to ſleep—inactivity, and fullneſs of the head—obſtructed viſcera—jaundice—dropſy—aſthma—apoplexy—and a number of chronic complaints, if the practice is continued.</p>
            <p>But if an error has been committed, and eſpecially if that has been with high-ſeaſoned diſhes, a draught of cold water, acidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with elixir of vitriol, taken ſoon after eating, will relieve the ſtomach from that weight with which it is often oppreſſed, aſſiſt digeſtion, reſtrain fermentation, and prevent flatulency; from hence, perhaps, the uſe of ices may be approved.</p>
            <p>I remember an account given me of a dignified clergyman, who was ſo great a ſlave to his appetite, that he was obliged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to have recourſe to ſome application to prevent indigeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he gormandized ſo abominably; as a proof of his gluttony, I cannot give it a gentler term, the following is recited of him: He was invited to dinner, where every rarity the place afforded, was provided, of which he eat in his uſual manner; but the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, with whom he dined, knowing he was extremely fond
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028021_0103_0FD670E3F27B4378"/>
of veniſon, and being well acquainted with his diſpoſition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the haunch in ſucceſſion, of which he had advertiſed he reſt of the company; on its appearance, the already ſatiated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, after expreſſing his ſurpriſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not being informed of this luxury before, retreated into the yard, diſgorged the load he had before ſwallowed, and returned to the attack of the veniſon, with his accuſtomed vigor and proweſs, to the aſtoniſhment of his companions. Hence we may infer, vomits in many caſes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſerviceable; however, at an early period, he became the victim of diſeaſe, and died of a dropſy, ſucceeding an irremediable jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, brought on from this courſe of living.</p>
            <p>With regard to our food, however, in quantity and quality, it ſhould be properly proportioned to our exerciſe. The farmer, who follows his plow, and is perpetually toiling from morning till night, could not exiſt on food appropriated to thoſe who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue not the ſeverer exerciſe of the body; his diet muſt be of the coarſer kind, ſuch as old milk cheeſe, ſalted meats, bread made of rye, potatoes, &amp;c. &amp;c. and theſe in pretty large quantities. This food anſwers to him the purpoſes of nature, keeps his body in a ſtate of health, becauſe his digeſtive powers are very active, and form from theſe materials good chyle, on account of the occupation in which he is engaged; which in the more delicate and leſs laborious, or indolent, would occaſion great indiſpoſition. In Herefordſhire, and ſome other counties, men are not allowed fit for ſervice, nor get hired, without, as it is termed, they can bolt bacon; that is, ſwallow it unmaſticated, cut into pieces, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an inch and an half, or two inches long, and half an inch ſquare, or thereabouts, and this in tolerable quantities; and this is done in order that they may attend cloſely to their labour, without ſpending any time in taking in nouriſhment for their neceſſary ſupport; for bacon being fat, and of a firm texture, from being hardened by ſalt in its curing, will lie a long time in an undigeſted ſtate, by which means the cravings of the appetite are kept off, and the ſtrength ſupported.</p>
            <p>But ſhould abſtinence he unavoidable, a man, during that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, ſhould not undertake any laborious employment: as in that caſe, the conſumption of the thinner fluids would be too great, the ſolids would be rendered weak for want of proper ſupport, and the liquids diſpoſed either to form concretions, that is, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into too thick maſſes, or run into a ſtate of putreſcent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony.</p>
            <p>There is one cuſtom to which the generality of mankind are apt to be addicted; when they have ſuffered fatigue, and that perhaps ſevere, from hunting, ſhooting, cricket playing, walking, &amp;c. they commonly indulge their appetites by eating copiouſly
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028021_0104_0FD670B2ECEFB538"/>
of ſolid food; and think it one of the benefits from thence ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are enabled to throw down ſuch a load of groſs materials; nay, not content with this, they make them float in porter, ale, or ſome other viſcid liquor, and afterwards indulge themſelves with a jolly bottle; and this they think ſupported by reaſon, for where the machine is weakened, it ſeems natural to ſuppoſe it requires much refreſhment. If we examine the effects of ſuch indiſcreet conduct, we cannot heſitate to pronounce it erroneous, and condemn the practice: for after eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in this manner, they grow dull and heavy; and general laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude comes on; the pulſe grows quick; the face fluſhes; a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary fever ſucceeds; ſleep is diſturbed; profuſe ſweats break out or a too great general heat, with dryneſs of the ſkin, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible; the mouth is clammy; thirſt is an attendant; and they riſe in the morning weary, and afflicted with pain, or ſtiffneſs in the joints, wanting that alacrity and activity they ought to poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

Indeed, oftentimes a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laid for infinitely more ſerious complaints, according to the peculiar nature of the fever; nay, ſometimes immediately brought on, ſuch as inflammatory or ſlow fevers, local inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rheumatiſm, &amp;c. Nor can it be otherwiſe, for all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, natural, and animal powers are weakened, and a load la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Were they to confine themſelves to liquid food, or that ſort readily digeſtible, ſuch as weak broth, milk, light bread pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp;c. with wine and water for their beverage, all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies would be prevented; the body would only receive that nutriment it could readily digeſt, and the veſſels from not being over diſtended and their actions too powerfully ſolicited by a conſtant ſtimulus, ſoon recover, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The conſtitution may be brought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ear many alterations, but theſe muſt be accompliſhed in a gradual manner, for few of any conſequence happen, but they occaſion an alteration in ſome of the ſolid of the ſyſtem, producing either a greater degree of extenſion or contraction—conſequently alſo a change is created in the fluids: and if any defect ſhould happen in one part, from the mode of producing thoſe changes, nature provides againſt ſuch defect by adapting ſome other parts to the performance of
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028021_0105_0FD670EA608D3C98"/>
their duty, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a greater or a leſs degree, or a duty that is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally intended for them; as we ſee in the decreaſe of one eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, it often promotes the increaſe of another: and veſſels appropriated to the diſcharge of one fluid, will often emit ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in caſes of obſtructed menſes, where blood has iſſued pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodically from the eyes and lungs; ſo that all ſudden changes may be productive of a variety of complaints, not only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the parts being unaccuſtomed to perform their proper offices, and from want of uſe being rendered too weak, but want of time for nature to make ſuitable diſpoſitions, to alleviate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ariſing from ſudden contingencies.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if a man has laboured under ſevere hunger, his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach will be in a ſtate of contractility, leſſened in its capacity more than uſual; loading it conſequently too heavily, will either occaſion vomiting, or uneaſy ſenſation of weight: heart-burn, perhaps inflammation, or a ſpaſm of both the orifices, or either of them—or miſchief might be created in other parts of the machine, from filling the veſſels, which muſt alſo be in too contractile a ſtate, too full of crude ill formed chyle; for in this ſituation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the peculiar juices of the liver—ſweet-bread—nor thoſe of the ſtomach itſelf, can be ſeparated in their proper quantity, nor will be endowed with their natural qualities, ſufficiently perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the buſineſs of digeſtion—all which are abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for forming the nutritious fluid in a ſalutary ſtate.</p>
            <p>And what on the contrary will happen, if a man, after full feeding, filling the habit copiouſly and conſtantly with liquids, ſhould ſubmit to abſolute faſting?</p>
            <p>As it is neceſſary to keep up a plenitiude in the veſſels, that the fluids may preſerve their power of reaction, as a ſtimulus aſſiſting powerfully the promotion of vaſcular contraction, and thus maintaining an eaſy and equable circulation, we from time to time throw in food to ſupply the defect of the fluids, which ariſes from the conſtant and natural action of the veſſels; and this not only conſtitues a requiſite equilibrium, or neceſſary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in the powers of the circulatory ſyſtem, but alſo ſupports a continuance of preſſure upon the brain, which is very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial for the performance of its duty in the body; ſince we find in proportion as that organ is deprived of that preſſure, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms not its functions regularly—hence convulſions—faintings—death; and we alſo find the more plethoric a man is in a ſtate of health, generally the more warmth he has in his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</p>
            <p>Now if a man is filled with fluids from eating and drinking inordinately, the conſtitution will act under the impulſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſtimulus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:028021_0106_0FD670B4AA9444C0"/>
Sudden and total abſtinence therefore would prevent the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the brain's action, and render the ſyſtem languid from withdrawing the ſtimulus, by which it had been actuated—the veſſels would collapſe—circulation would be carried on with difficulty—the heart oppreſſed—and in the firſt inſtance, ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary concretions might be formed. But ſhould the cauſe be permanent, the humors, for want of freſh ſupply of new fluids, would grow ſharp and acrimonious—general irritation take place—a fever enſue—an inflammation of the brain come on—and a delirium cloſe the ſcene.</p>
            <p>Having examined the effects produced by ſevere hunger, and gratification of the appetite copiouſly and conſtantly, and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changing from one to the other; let us now examine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the extremes of reſt and labour, ſucceeding each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>And firſt—What will be the reſult if total reſt ſhould ſucceed hard labour?</p>
            <p>The conſtitution being habituated by cuſtom to any particular practices, eſpecially where the motion of the ſolids are principally concerned, is ſo uſed to the impreſſions made by thoſe practices, that they become neceſſary to its welfare. Hence a man accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to hard labour, enjoys a better ſtate of health, under that circumſtance, than if he was to fall entirely into habits of indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; for the ſyſtem being diveſted of thoſe particular impulſes, uſual to be given, would experience a degree of torpor, or ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs—the fluids conſtantly increaſed to ſupply the diſpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um or conſumption, having no occaſion to be appropriated to that purpoſe, would form collections in the vaſcular, glandular, and cellular ſyſtem—and hence would ariſe a variety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints from fullneſs, and corpulency—and a foundation be laid for numberleſs chronic diſorders.</p>
            <p>And we may obſerve many men, retiring from avocations which require bodily activity into the arms of idleneſs, though poſſeſſing their health under former ſituations, plunge into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe—and numbers of them die apoplectic—paralytic—aſthma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic—or dropſical.</p>
            <p>But, on the contrary, if men apply to hard labour ſuddenly, from a ſtate of abſolute reſt—the conſtitution will become lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, from want of proper ſupport, and be affected with differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds of conſumptions, not of the lungs particularly, but gradual waſting away—dropſies—fevers, &amp;c.—for the veſſels not having been ſolicited to ſtrong action, and the fluids, though abundant in quantity, not properly elaborated to repair the loſs ſevere exerciſe occaſions, the former will be weakened by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den increaſe of action, and want of adequate ſupplies;—while
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028021_0107_0FD670EC36F9C6B8"/>
the latter may form congeſtions in the head, or internal parts, by being puſhed ſuddenly forward, and too violently, and ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a dangerous and noxious acrimony from crudity, or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.</p>
            <p>But though extremes in theſe particulars are highly injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becoming the prolific parents of many maladies, yet purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under proper limitations, are replete with innumerable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages—for exerciſe and reſt are the certain ſupporters of a pleaſurable life, as far as it depends on general health—Hence muſt we allow every ſpecies of the former very beneficial—but then it muſt be limited by the ſtrength—for when in proper proportion it gives conſtitutional vigour, and muſcular firmneſs—while inaction renders the body liſtleſs, and relaxed—and, indeed, if exerciſe is purſued to the diſtreſs of the natural pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it creates a number of injuries, which its judicious uſe would inevitably prevent.</p>
            <p>Beſides we muſt obſerve, that all exerciſe, of whatever nature, whether walking—running—fencing—riding on horſeback—or in a carriage—playing at cricket, tennis, &amp;c. ſhould be adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the prevention of any diſeaſe the perſon ſo uſing it may have a tendency to fall into—to thoſe liable to fall into <hi>gravelly complaints</hi> riding on horſeback ſhould be recommended;—to have <hi>collections of phlegm upon the lungs,</hi> reading aloud—ſinging;—<hi>thoſe ſubject to the gout,</hi> walking;—<hi>indigeſtion, or viſceral obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> riding; <hi>ſubject to catch cold,</hi> walking;—thoſe of ſtrong muſcular ſtamina, having <hi>a ſluggiſh circulation and coldneſs,</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at cricket or tennis;—to <hi>hyſteric diſeaſes,</hi> or <hi>melancholic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> where the mind broods too much over imaginary cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities—driving a carriage—ſhooting—hunting, or ſome, where their reflection may be withdrawn from unpleaſant objects, &amp;c.—and thoſe exerciſes which are more or leſs violent, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed according to the ends we wiſh to promote;—for the grand buſineſs of theſe are to increaſe the tone of the ſolids—make the different glands perform their functions; promote inſenſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; and prevent the fluids from becoming detrimental to either by their thinneſs, viſcidity, or acrimony.</p>
            <p>Exerciſe may be divided into theſe three degrees—the STRONGEST of which are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi>—Playing at tennis, cricket, fencing, and running, &amp;c, where great muſcular exertions is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi>—Walking, reading aloud, riding on horſeback, or in a carriage:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt</hi>—Sailing, chamber-horſe, dumb-bells, and frictions: which laſt are appropriated to old age, where muſcular force begins to grow effete; and are neceſſary for the preſervation of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028021_0108_0FD670BA0B717180"/>
health, by promoting the circulation of the blood, and motion of the fluids, through the minute veſſels.</p>
            <p>But <hi>ſleep</hi> is eſteemed the grand preſerver and reſtorer of health, ſuch as is well-timed, and properly proportioned; for ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions require much more than others.—It is one thing the moſt eſſentially neceſſary to life, as this is the time when the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem is freed from all incumbrances, undiſturbed by mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which often diſorder the animal economy, and prevent the human frame from acting, through all her departments, with equality, and full force, in which the nutritious particles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly perfected by the operation of the conſtitution, or chiefly applied to repair the waſte, and replace thoſe which have been abraded, and waſhed off by the labor and exerciſe of the day.</p>
            <p>Thus ſituated, the moving and aſſimilating powers of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy have only that buſineſs by which the parts are renewed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and the veſſels are properly diſpoſed to receive ſuch addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are required, and co-operate to that end; but if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine is too much indulged in this particular, it becomes much diſpoſed to be corpulent, languid, and weak, and feel a number of inconveniencies from thence ariſing.</p>
            <p>With regard to the time neceſſary for the producing the good effects it is various in different conſtitutions: ſix or ſeven hours reſt is ſufficient for many adult conſtitutions, though ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nine or twelve.—A lady whom I attended, of a relaxed and delicate habit, ſubject to hyſteric affections, and an acrimonious ſtate of humors, though by no means indolently diſpoſed, was adviſed to riſe early, and gradually leſſen the time ſhe uſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote to her bed, which was conſtantly twelve hours, and which was ſuppoſed to contribute much to the relaxation of her habit—ſhe made the attempt for ſome time, but could never enjoy ſo comfortable a ſtate of health, as when ſhe indulged herſelf in her uſual cuſtom.</p>
            <p>Still in many this indulgence enervates the ſyſtem—renders them hypochondriacal and hyſterical—relaxes the ſolids—diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the humors to be viſcid, or acrimonious—blunts the vital powers—and brings on a diſeaſed, and early old age.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding, we will allow that nature herſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, in different conſtitutions, ſuch variability;—the cuſtom of ſleeping long, and indulging in bed, is very frequently the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of indolence, early induced, and long encouraged:—ſuch a diſgraceful waſte of time ſhould be diſcountenanced, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit conquered, which may always be accompliſhed, in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and middle part of life, where it ariſes not from conſtitutional neceſſity, naturally implanted; but it muſt be done by ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, for all extremes of change are detrimental.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:028021_0109_0FD670EDC057CC90"/>
It is the practice of numbers to indulge themſelves in ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the day-time; ſome immediately after dinner—ſtill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what has been advanced by ſome authors, that ſleep is uſeful even at thoſe times, as it promotes digeſtion, I think the rule, very often, more ſalutary in the breach than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; for it creates giddineſs and languor, eſpecially in thoſe addicted to ſtudy—deadens their thinking faculties, deſtroys per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, and clouds the imagination; but if no ſuch effects are perceived, and people find themſelves recruited, alert, and active, it may be allowed.</p>
            <p>In proportion as the powers of digeſtion are more or leſs ſtrong in different ages, with reſpect to DIET, they have claimed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds.</p>
            <p>To the younger claſs of ſubjects, and children, therefore, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands of the milder, and ſofter ſort, are conſidered as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as being more readily aſſimilated.</p>

            <p>For old people, it has been thought adviſeable to retrench of their ſolid, take that nouriſhment which is more fluid, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe rather in drinking; becauſe they not only digeſt leſs free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the machine approaches more to dryneſs, from a defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in their juices.</p>
            <p>Were the regulations here laid down obſerved with tolerable attention, and thoſe adverted to which have been ſpoken of, when treating of the Non-naturals, adapting them to the peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of different conſtitutions, a plan may be formed by every individual ſufficient to contribute towards the continuance of health; nay, be fully adequate to inſure its preſervation, if cloſely purſued.</p>
            <p>Theſe rules, though, are calculated for thoſe who are arrived at the years of maturity, or at ſuch a time of life, that they may become ſubject to the directions of others, who have made theſe things their ſtudy, and have from thence acquired a competent knowledge.</p>
            <p>But before we conclude this part of our work, it ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to take notice of what is neceſſary to be done in the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſtate, in order to promote for our offspring, in their tender years, the ſame benefits—and this leads us to conſider the good or evil conſequences of proper or injudicious Nurſing, which we ſhall make the ſubject of our next Section.</p>

            <head>SECTION VI. On NURSING.</head>
            <p>IF we look into and examine the bills of mortality, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at what ages the greateſt number of people die, we ſhall find that half of them go off under the age of five years:—to what are we to attribute this? That nature is defective in her operations, and that half of mankind are born in ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a ſtate, formed of materials ſo bad, or ſo defectively united, that they cannot ſupport the operations neceſſary for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their exiſtence any longer? Or are we to conclude that in that period they are ſubject to more fatal maladies, and die the victims of diſeaſe in greater proportion than at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time? Were ſuch concluſions to be formed, we ſhould be accuſing the Omnipotence of Providence, or arraigning the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent of Heaven, NATURE, of executing her office wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly, or improvidently. This, then, cannot be the caſe; for if we look through the vegetable or mineral kingdom, we ſhall never find that any of their productions are ſubject to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, merely becauſe they are in a ſtate of primary exiſtence—or in the brute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe they are young. When deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happens to them, it is from being placed in ſuch ſituations, and under ſuch circumſtances, as are not congenial with their peculiar nature:—ſo happens it, I have no doubt, with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies that this mortality in the infantile ſtate is owing to bad nurſing, where, by theſe means, the operations of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution are impeded, or perverted from the indolence, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or ſuperſtition of thoſe allotted to rear the infant in its tenderer years—and it is aſtoniſhing, that, in a buſineſs requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the utmoſt ſimplicity for its ſucceſs, ſo many, and ſuch great errors ſhould be committed, as to become too certainly, and too commonly fatal, particularly in children born of delicate and weakly parents; who, partaking of their conſtitutions, are liable to be ſeverely afflicted from indiſcreet management, and want ſtrength to ſtruggle through calamities originating from that ſource.</p>
            <p>Let us caſt our eye amongſt the hardy ſons of the ruſtic race—compare thoſe with the offspring of the more refined and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed—what a difference in appearance! Amongſt the former, we find the children firm, robuſt, lively, healthful, active, and ſtrong; amongſt the latter, weak, puny, relaxed, and ſickly. Amongſt
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028021_0111_0FD670EF465A09A0"/>
the former few die, but from the acceſſion of unavoidable illneſs, as meaſles, ſmall-pox, chin-cough, dentition, &amp;c. Among the latter numberleſs expire from gripes, looſeneſſes, hectic fevers, worms and convulſions.</p>
            <p>But there are greater evils than diſſolution in this ſtate from this cauſe; for from hence diſeaſe itſelf is generated, and ſo fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the habit, that the life of many is oftentimes one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſcene of miſery;—nay, I have no doubt but, from this ſource, the temper and diſpoſition acquire ſo fretful a caſt, and oftentimes is ſo ſoured, and rendered ſo petulent and peeviſh, that, whilſt they do exiſt, they continue unhappy and miſerable in themſelves, as well as troubleſome and offenſive to their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants and their aſſociates; for it has been allowed, that the faculties of the mind, very often depend upon the organs of the body; for when theſe are in a tolerable perfect ſtate, ſo as to perform their ſeparate functions properly, the thinking part is more alert, active, and cheerful; and good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the conſequence of ſuch freedom—whilſt the contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are produced, when the organs are diſturbed, or diſeaſed. To avoid, then, which diſagreeable effects, it is our buſineſs to lay down ſuch regulations as are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounded on rational principles, ſupported by experience, and which conſiſt in bringing up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in a plain and ſimple manner, the mode moſt conſonant with nature; and if we obſerve the method ſhe invariably pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, we ſhall find that ſhe delights in ſimplicity alone. View but the brute creation, and thoſe of the feathered race—ſee what occurs in them; examine what method they, rearring their young, inſtictively adopt, and mark their ſucceſs; cleanlineſs, proper feeding and exerciſe, comprehend in theſe the infinite wiſdom of her laws; and if we add judicious cloathing, ſo ſhould they that of the human ſpecies.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as quadrupeds bring forth their young, the firſt care of the mother is properly to clean them, and keep them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly warm, till all the moiſture is exhaled from the ſurface of the body; ſo happens it with birds: after which the young ſleep for ſome time—almoſt conſtantly for the firſt few days; in brutes, ſupported by the mother's milk alone, which is ready in the breaſt at an early period, the young ſoon walk, and become play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſportive, by which means they procure to themſelves ſufficient exerciſe, and in this manner are brought up with eaſe and certainty: with reſpect to cleanlineſs, the feathered race do the ſame, never leaving their young after they are hatched, till they are perfectly clean and dry; the mother, as ſoon as the egg is freed from the young, placing it under her in the warmeſt part; but as they are diveſted of milk, in order to nouriſh them, if of the granivorous kind, ſhe endeavours to render their nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028021_0112_0FD670BCEB8BA8C8"/>
the moſt eaſily digeſtible, and as nearly fluid as poſſible, by picking up grain, macerating for ſome time in her ſtomach, and then throwing it up into the mouths of her young, who, whilſt feeding, flutter their wings, and agitate their whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in a ſurpriſing manner, which ſerves as a ſpecies of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and this univerſally prevails in all ſuch as lay in the ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In raiſing up our young, we therefore cannot do better than imitate theſe laws, ſo univerſally prevalent, of which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

under which all will be included neceſſary for the proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe who make nurſing their particular buſineſs, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that office from neceſſity or inclination.—And firſt we muſt obſerve,</p>
            <p>That numbers of children, as ſoon as they are born, are cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a mucus, or white ſordes, which ought to be waſhed off with ſoap and water; but ſhould it be very adheſive, there is no neceſſity of rubbing the infant ſeverely at firſt, for on the ſecond dreſſing, if any remains, it will readily come off; and long continued or violent friction is apt to create uneaſineſs, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the child to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> cold, and produce inflammation; and as cold, at this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> period, occaſions ſeveral diſagreeable conſequences, particularly ſore eyes—cough—ſtuffing at the breaſt—gripes—looſeneſs—or ſtoppage in the noſe, at the birth, it ſhould be wrapped up in a flannel receiver, lined with fine old linen, and kept from the contact of the cold air, for a quarter or half an hour, before it is cleaned, and this ſhould be performed before the fire; indeed, before the infant is taken from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will be prudent to cover the eyes by a ſoft linen bandage, and faſten it at the back part of the head. As ſoon as the child is cleaned, and well dried, the naval ſtring ſhould be carefully folded up in a piece of ſcorched rag, in two or three folds; for this not only prevents the infant from running the riſque of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing griped by the coldneſs of the naval ſtring, but abſorbs the offenſive liquid which is generated by its running into a corrupt ſtate.</p>
            <p>It is the cuſtom next for nurſes to rub the child's head ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well with their hand after waſhing, and apply brandy or ſome ardent ſpirits at the ſame time, and then forcibly preſs the head in different directions, under the notion of aiding in joining the bones, where the ſutures are open, a contrivance of nature, apparently that in labour the dimenſions of the head may
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028021_0113_0FD670F0B4DD7280"/>
be leſſened by the different bones riding one over the other, and delivery, by theſe means, be facilitated; after which the child's head is tight bound up with with a forehead cloth.</p>
            <p>This over officiouſneſs is highly detrimental and derogatory to the intent of nature; for by preſſing the head too forcibly, and keeping it in a confined ſtate, prevents the proper circulation of the blood through the veſſels of the brain, and brings on convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and other complaints from congeſtion; and all this without in the leaſt anſwering the intent for which this abſurd cuſtom is practiſed. For the bones join not by the edges of them coming in contact with each other, but from bony matter depoſited in the cartilaginous and membranous ſubſtance of the cranium, and forming a junction in this way, and therefore the head ſhould be leſt entirely to itſelf, after being well cleaned, without the labour has been very ſevere; then ſometimes the vertex will be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwelled by the long continuance of labour, occaſioning great preſſure upon the larger part of the head, and impeding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the fluids, by which the ſkin on the vertex of the crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um will be ſo loaded with fluids, as ſometimes to produce a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, not inferior in ſize to a large egg, which may in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame and ſuppurate, as I have obſerved, particularly where imprudently managed.</p>
            <p>Inſtead, therefore, of ſubmitting the head to ſo ſevere friction, let it be bathed, where ſwelled, with brandy—arquabuſade water—or ſome other ardent ſpirits; or rags, three or four doubles, may be dipped in Goulard's ſaturnine water, mixed with about a fourth or fifth part brandy, and applied to the part affected; and then the head ſhould be covered with a looſe flannel cap, over which may be placed a linen one, tied under the chin only juſt ſo tight as to keep it upon the head: and this operation may be repeated once a day till the ſwelling ſubſides, which will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be in the ſpace of two or three days.</p>
            <p>Under the idea of giving ſtrength to the child's back, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it to ſupport itſelf, it uſed to be the practice, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in ſome country villages, to ſwathe or roll the child very tight round the abdomen, with a very broad roller; by which means the circulation of the blood was impeded, the ſuperior parts loaded, the periſtaltic motion of the inteſtines, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the abdominal muſcles, hindered from properly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their offices; hence gripes—convulſions—coughs—and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uneaſineſs. Inſtead, therefore, of this roller, a ſhort flannel petticoat, with a broad head ſhould be tied round on the waiſt, only ſo tight, as that a finger will eaſily paſs under it; ſo that if the child's belly ſwells, as it ſometimes will from flatulence, it may experience no uneaſineſs: and if after this a long linen
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028021_0114_0FD670BE722B6DF8"/>
gown is put on, the child will be ſufficiently dreſſed, be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaſy, and no obſtruction occur to prevent nature performing her proper operations. But there is another error frequently committed with reſpect to what they think neceſſary to give the infant internally; therefore, as ſoon as it is dreſſed, they cram down its throat a large lump of butter and coarſe ſugar; or give it oil of ſweet almonds and ſyrup of violets: or ſhould the infant lick its lips, it muſt be fed with pig, that is, it muſt be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuck the fat of that animal, in order to appeaſe, it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, a ſenſation which ariſes from its mother's having longed for ſomething or another during her pregnancy.</p>
            <p>Were there nothing but the mere folly and abſurdity to be conſidered as the reſult of this practice, it would not be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſay any thing to induce its forbearance; but theſe things are pernicious, inaſmuch as they mix with the meconium, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor with which a child's bowels is naturally loaded, prevents its growing ſufficiently acrid to produce its purgative effect, or ſheath the bowels from feeling the effect, and thus produce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaints which load, oppreſſion, and diſtenſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinal canal are apt to bring on: for nature ſeems to intend this meconium to clear, at an early ſtage, the firſt paſſages of the ſordes which have accumulated there. If, therefore, it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to give ſomething to the infant, a little caſtor oil, and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſyrup, will be the beſt, becauſe it anſwers the purpoſe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the meconium. For if we conſider the ſtate of the infant during labour—the effects of the meconium left to itſelf—the time before the mother acquires her milk, and that its property is at firſt aperient, we ſhall obviouſly ſee the reaſon, why nature preſerves this regularity in ſoliciting a diſcharge of fluids through the primae viae; and ſhew that if any thing is to be attempted, her plan ought to direct all our operations. For beſides clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtomach and bowels of its contents, which, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance there, might produce diſagreeable and dangerous effects, it ſeems intended to prevent the too free determination of blood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the veſſels of the brain, which might be in a weakened ſtate from the ſeverity of labour: for the brain very often ſuffers great compreſſion from the bones of the head paſſing through the pelvis; indeed it is often ſo great, that the bones will wrap con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably one over the other, and conſequently the capacity of the cranium be much diminiſhed; by which means the blood will be prevented from paſſing into the exterior part of the brain, which is thrown into the head by the arteries appropriated for that purpoſe, conſequently the internal veſſels will receive a more than proper quantity, and by being too much diſtended, of courſe be weakened, and that in proportion to the continuance and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028021_0115_0FD670F47B31DAB8"/>
of ſuch preſſure; in order, therefore, to prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which would ariſe from ſuch debility, if continued, and the ſucceeding accumulation, I conceive nature very wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted purging, that the veſſels may recover their due tone; and that this is one principal reaſon, I am induced to believe, from the firſt of the mother's milk always having a purgative property.</p>
            <p>But however, I think that the leſs any ſort of theſe things are given the better. As ſoon, therefore, as the child is dreſſed, and the mother laid in a clean and comfortable ſituation, the child ſhould be placed in bed by her, and both left to go to reſt, which they will ſoon do, and ſleep perhaps for ſix or ſeven hours, by which means they will be refreſhed, and recover in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the fatigue they have both undergone: then the mother ſhould be fed with ſome thin broth, or weak wine gruel, and a little bread, or ſome ſuch ſimple materials; and the child, if the mother intends to nurſe it, ſet to the breaſt; notwithſtanding what ſome authors have ſaid to the contrary, under the idea, that as nature does not furniſh any quantity of milk in the breaſt, till the expiration of three days or thereabouts, it is uſeleſs, and only teazing to the mother and child, to have it ſet to before. This I am perfectly perſuaded though is erroneous, and often attended with diſagreeable conſequences, both to the mother and infant, diſpoſing the former to febrile affections, and bringing on a milk fever, from pain created by diſtention of the veſſels of the breaſt, and keeping the infant too long from that ſalutary food which nature has provided for it, and acts at firſt in a double ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as we have before ſpecified; beſides it ſupplies an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for ignorant and over officious nurſes to cram the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with a variety of dabs, and too viſcid food; by which means a foundation is laid for a number of complaints, from loading and oppreſſing the alimentary canal, by ſuch things as are unconquerable by the digeſtive powers of the infantile ſtate; hence ariſe crudities, acidity, flatulence, and convulſions, which by a different management would be prevented. For by ſetting the child at an early period to the mother's breaſt, by the gentle ſtimulus on the nipple from ſucking, the milk is ſolicited in a gradual manner into the breaſt—the veſſels are made by degrees permeable—the infant receives it at firſt in ſmall quantities, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate to its wants and digeſtive powers—no ſuperabundance of milk is collected, nor a ſudden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low of it into the lactiferous tubes, by which diſtenſion, pain, and febrile affections to the mother are prevented; the child's ſtomach is not overloaded, nor too great a quantity of fluid thrown into the habit, which would be injurious to ſeveral parts of the machine, particularly
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028021_0116_0FD670BFEE557B10"/>
the head—lungs—and liver—as the circulation of the blood is now altered from what it was before the birth, and conſequently the veſſels in thoſe organs incapable to bear ſudden and too free diſtenſion; for the parts of the human machine are always bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabled to ſuffer changes brought on in a gradual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate mode, than by ſuch as operate in the contrary extreme; and this ſeems, in the caſe of which we are ſpeaking, to be the intent of unerring nature; it is ſo perfectly rational, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription alone carries along with it conviction. Indeed, I am ſo clearly convinced of the great utility and good conſequences ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the adoption of this method, both from reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that I univerſally recommend it to thoſe who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and willing to ſuckle their own children; and in all health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubjects, it is a practice which ſhould on no account be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with; for to me, there is little doubt but that the milk of the mother is better adapted to the conſtitution of her own offspring than of any other; beſides the advantages attending the firſt, as much ſo, I think, as the natural ſoil is to any indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous vegetable: nor do I ſtand ſingle in this opinion; for many authors, who have written beſt on this ſubject, not only ſupport the ſame doctrine, but think that the mother's milk is ſufficient for the nouriſhment of the infant for the firſt twelve months, and recommend that, to that alone they ſhould adhere.</p>
            <p>Could we inſure the health of the mother and child, I ſhould not heſitate to enforce the cuſtom; but as both are liable to fall into diſpoſitions, which may either, on the one hand, render the milk improper, from its nutritious qualities being altered; or, on the other, from its increaſing ſome complaint in the primae viae. I think, during the child's being nouriſhed from the breaſt, it ſhould be fed once or twice a day with the boat; that if any accident ſhould render it abſolutely neceſſary to wean the child, or take it for a time from the breaſt, no inconvenience may ariſe from ſuch an alteration; for many children feed ſolely by the breaſt—take very ill to the boat: nay, ſome indeed are obliged to be ſupplied by the breaſt of a ſtranger, a circumſtance often painful, and almoſt always diſagreeable to the parents—and as a ſuccedaneum for the mother's milk that of aſſes is the beſt, or artificial aſſes milk with a little bread, called tops and bottoms; or roll, or biſcuit—not the common bread, for that has in its compoſition too much of alum, and may, in habits where there is a propenſity to coſtiveneſs, be particularly hurtful.</p>
            <p>But as children are apt to have moſt of their complaints ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate from acidities in the ſtomach and bowels, or to have ſuch acidities very often as a diſtreſſing conſequence, it would be right to uſe them to the taſte of other viands; particularly weak veal
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028021_0117_0FD670F5F4DC2678"/>
broth, or that of mutton; or beef ſea, if they ſhould have no diſpoſition to febrile affections:—but, whatever the food, care ſhould be taken never to overload the ſtomach, as is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the cuſtom; ſo much ſo, that often, in the day, they may be obſerved reſtleſs, uneaſy, and ſick, and relieved alone by frequently puking—a happy remedy againſt the miſtaken huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of over-fond mothers; for it is a common practice with them, and other nurſes, as ſoon, or as often as a child cries, or appears fretful, to appeaſe it by giving the breaſt, though it ſhould, a few minutes before, have ſucked to ſatiety. Inſtead of this, the child ſhould be amuſed by dandling gently, or by ſome other means diverted: exerciſe however is the beſt, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its age. In the firſt months, ſuch as is moderate, and of the gentler kind; afterwards, as its ſtrength increaſes, ſo may the exerciſe; for this quickens circulation, augments perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſiſts digeſtion, and helps to clear away viſceral obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and prevent coſtiveneſs. Indeed, in the early ſtage, it is uſeful, twice a day, when dreſſing and undreſſing the child, for the nurſe to rub it well with her hands, particularly on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, down the back and abdomen, before the fire, for a quarter of an hour each morning and evening.—The infant will ſhew its approbation, and the utility, by kicking and throwing about i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> legs, ſmiling, crowing, and by a perceptible brightneſs in its eyes, and cheerfulneſs in its countenance. In ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, particularly in ſome parts of Scotland, mothers very early adopt the cuſtom of dipping their children every morning into cold water; on which cuſtom Dr. Cullen makes the following obſervation: That he had ſeldom, or never ſeen the offspring of their women, ſo treated, ſubject to the rickets. It has long been recommended, and I think with ſome advantage, to waſh the legs, thighs, back, and head, with cold water. In this cuſtom there appear two very material advantages—cleanlineſs, and gently increaſing the tone of the ſyſtem: by which the ſyſtem is unloaded, and ſtrength given to the muſcular fibres. And upon theſe two principles, regularly promoted, is it, perhaps, that we may attribute, in a great degree, the prevention of that complaint we have juſt alluded to—a complaint, the conſtant concomitant of naſtineſs, inordinate feeding, with improper food, and indolence.</p>
            <p>Though this practice is very ſerviceable to healthful children, ſtill, in ſuch as are delicate, and diſpoſed to inteſtinal complaints, ſome attention ought to be paid to the degree of cold uſed on this occaſion; and therefore, in theſe, it may be prudent to mix a portion of warm water with that which is cold, ſo that it may ſtill remain a proportionate degree of cold, compared with the

natural warmth of the conſtitution, but of warmth compared with other common water; for we know that ſome will bear cold bathing, or waſhing, and receive abundant benefit, if the degree of cold only be ſuch, that the internal part of the ſyſtem ſhall be capable of producing re-action adequate to the impulſe of the fluids occaſioned by the external application; if not, many diſagreeable conſequences occur, ariſing from a load being thrown upon the internal parts too ſuddenly, and too copiouſly, ſo as to overpower their action, ſuch as congeſtions in, obſtructions, and inflammations of the brain, lungs, viſcera, and ſome of the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular parts, wherever they appear, from their debility, to be moſt prediſpoſed to ſuch affections.</p>
            <p>In this method it may be neceſſary to perſiſt for three, four, or five months; but as children grow ſtronger, they then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally require thicker and ſtronger food, given them once or twice a day; cow's milk with roll, biſcuit. Tops and bottoms may be made uſe of, moderately ſweetened, or panada, mixed with new milk, warm; and this food ſhould be made freſh twice a day in winter, and three times in ſummer: the new milk ſhould not be boiled, but mixed with hot panada, or pap; nor ſhould the viands be made ſweeter than that of mother's milk, nor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hotter than milk from the cow; for victuals too hot, or too ſweet, are apt to occaſion relaxation of the ſtomach and bowels, and create morbid aſcidity; and ſhould the child be of a coſtive habit, ſoft Liſbon ſugar, if laxative, ſuperfine ſugar ſhould be made uſe of: broths alſo ſhould make part of their food, minc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chicken, or rabbit, with panada, and bread puddings, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly after they are weaned; conſequently, a little before, it would be right to accuſtom them to ſuch ſort of food. Potatoes is a food which numbers of children are fond of, and are very early accuſtomed to; however, to thoſe of delicate habit, I think them by no means proper, nor any other that are poſſeſſed of much viſcidity, inaſmuch as the accumulation of ſuch tenacious food in the ſtomach and inteſtines is apt to form a nidus for worms; but to thoſe of ſtrong digeſtive powers, born of health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, athletic parents, ſuch as common ruſtics, this prohibition is leſs neceſſary; as it has been obſerved, in countries where this vegetable root frequently and commonly makes part, and a great ſhare of their diet, no ſuch inconvenience has been obſerved; but this depends not upon the ſalubrity of ſuch ſort of diet, but upon the firm ſtamina, and great ſtrength of the digeſtive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of thoſe who feed on it—to the more delicate it is certainly injurious; and it is upon the ſtrength or debility of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional powers by which we muſt in general regulate our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in our directions.—If children are born healthful, and ſtrong,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028021_0119_0FD670F8436D51C0"/>
ſuch regulations as are above laid down, will be ſufficient to conduct them forwards, with eaſe and ſafety, for the firſt twelve months, or longer; but ſhould they be born ſickly, as is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the caſe, it may be aſked, are the ſame rules to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Under ſuch circumſtances, cleanlineſs, proper cloathing, gentle exerciſe, and the mother's milk, certainly form the beſt preventive and curative plan; for, by their proper adoption, I have no doubt but conſtitutions, weakly in their origin, may be ſtrengthened, and a number of complaints, the natural reſult of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility not only cured, but often prevented. Though ſome caution may be neceſſary in feeding children naturally weak, great care ſhould be taken never to overload the ſtomach, notwithſtanding the food ſhould be confined to that afforded by the mother; it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhould be adviſeable to give the breaſt to the child much oftner, ſo that a little milk only may be taken at a time, which will be eaſily and readily digeſted. This may be conſidered troubleſome to the mother, yet will ſhe be amply repaid, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her offspring improve daily under ſuch judicious manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and meliorating a conſtitution, which otherwiſe would be made worſe, and fall a ſacrifice to painful diſeaſe; for, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading the ſtomach, that organ would be weakened, crudities and acidities be generated, green ſtools, looſeneſs, gripes, and convulſions be the unvoidable conſequences; for almoſt all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints with which infants are at a very early period afflicted, except thoſe which ariſe hereditarily, from mal-conformation of ſome particular parts, infection, or contagion, deduce their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from defect in the alimentary tube, and that generally aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, occaſioned too often by indiſcreet and too copious feeding. But when ſuch acidities are too prevalent, they conſtitute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and will be taken notice of when we treat of ſuch as are incident to children; we ſhall only obſerve, if there appears a proneneſs in the habit to produce them, beſides the mode here directed for invigorating the conſtitution, it might be proper, now and then, to put a little magneſia into the victuals, if coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: if otherwiſe, ſome of the other prepared abſorbent earths, ſuch as chalk, crabs eyes, or prepared hartſhorn; feed the infant once or twice a day upon broth, and uſe rice inſtead of bread, for it is leſs apt to turn four than any other of the lighter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But many authors have, reſpecting mothers ſuckling their children, laid it down as an indiſpenſable duty, and advanced, that almoſt all, of whatever nature their conſtitution may be, are capable of performing that office with the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to their own conſtitutions, as well as to their children; for, ſays Dr. Cadogan, <q>When a child ſucks its own mother, which,

The mother would likewiſe, in moſt hyſterical nervous caſes, eſtabliſh her own health by it, though ſhe were weak and ſickly before, as well as that of her offspring.—For theſe reaſons I could wiſh, that every woman that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are given for this practice are very frivolous, and drawn from falſe premiſes; that ſome women are too weak to bear ſuch a drain, which would rob them of their own nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This is a very miſtaken notion: for the firſt general cauſe of moſt people's diſeaſes is, not want of nouriſhment, as is here imagined, but too great a fulneſs and redundancy of humors;—good at firſt, but being more than the body can employ, or conſume, they ſtag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>However, notwithſtanding this authority, I am certain that there are many mothers totally incapable of giving ſuck, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſuch as are of very delicate nervous conſtitutions, weak appetites, and poſſeſſed of bad digeſtive powers—whoſe fluids are acrimonious and habits ſubject to hyſteric affections; for theſe, in general, neither afford milk ſufficient in quantity, not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elaborated for nutrition: hence, when they attempt to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle their children, they do infinite miſchief to their own conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, by having it debilitated by the conſtant drain of what ſhould ſupport themſelves, and lay the foundation for a variety of complaints in their offspring, by pouring into it ſuch crude unwholeſome fluid. The children of ſuch women ſhould either be ſet to another woman's breaſt, or brought up by the boat. IF <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, there are ſome precautions requiſite to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſuch as we are directed to by the imitation of nature—as the infant is deprived of the mother's firſt milk, which is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and clears the primae viae of their ſordes, art muſt ſupply the deficiency by gentle means: the infant, then, ſhould have ſome aperient ingredient mixed with its food, as will prove pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative—the beſt of which is manna, and pulp of caſſia. Theſe may be given in ſuch quantities as will procure the child four ſtools every day for about eight or nine days; or a little caſtor
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028021_0121_0FD670FD064E49D0"/>
oil, mixed with ſyrup, may be given at proper intervals. Once a day, perhaps, may be ſufficient; or the nurſe may take ſome aperient electuary for the firſt week of ſuckling, which will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times anſwer the purpoſe equally, in ſuch doſes only as may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the milk with ſome of its aperient properties; after which, the ſame directions ſhould be purſued as have been before ſet down.</p>
            <p>But with regard to the ſelection of a nurſe much is neceſſary. She ſhould be young, cleanly, active, healthful, free from any complaint, poſſeſſed of a good appetite, and quick, eaſy, digeſtive powers; and, above all things, her milk ſhould not be too old—the nearer the time to her having laid in the better, for the milk will then partake more of the nature of the mother's milk. I have ſaid ſhe ſhould be young—by that I mean between twenty and thirty, for, at this time of life, they are generally in the moſt healthy ſtate, moſt active, and more capable of contending with fatigue, and other unavoidable caſualties, without prejudic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their milk—which fluid it will be neceſſary to examine, for ſome women's milk is apt to be too thick, ſweet, and rich, whilſt others appear thin and watery—that is beſt which partakes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too much of the one or the other of theſe extremes.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I have known parents very ſolicitous of dieting nurſes, in order to keep the milk in proper order, and this I have ſeen productive of bad effects. I would by no means take any nurſe from that mode of living by which ſhe enjoyed a good and perfect ſtate of health; for though we may tell what appears likely to produce general effects in the habit, if we form our judgment from experiments made on different materials out of the conſtitution, ſtill the peculiarities there exiſting, which can only be diſcovered by effects, make ſuch alterations, the cauſe of which we are unable to inveſtigate, and ſhould therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with obſerving the conſequences. I ſhould, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend that nurſes ſhould live in the common plain mode, of viands ſimple and nutritious, compoſed of animal and vegetable ſubſtances, avoiding all high-ſeaſoned diſhes, or ſalted proviſions; for theſe become difficult of digeſtion, create thirſt, induce fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile affections, and promote an acrimonious ſtate of fluids. I ſpecify this, becauſe nurſes, often taken into great families, are very deſirous of quitting their homely fare, and indulging in the luxuries of high life.</p>
            <p>If the BOAT is MADE CHOICE OF, a ſimilar mode ſhould be purſued with regard to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the primae viae, and the viands with which the child ſhould be fed, muſt be ſuch as moſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the mother's milk, fluid, not too ſweet, nor given too hot, and partaking, in ſome degree, of animal and vegetable nature—aſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,

or artificial aſs's milk, mixed with thin panada, made as above directed, or milk, warm from the cow: perhaps, in both caſes, feeding children at ſtated periods, about four times a day will be ſufficient, if that cuſtom is begun very early.</p>
            <p>So eſſentially neceſſary has exerciſe been conſidered towards the ſupport of health, that it has been adviſed by every author; but it ſhould be ſuch as is adapted to the age and conſtitution of the patient: in the firſt periods very gentle, afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, as the ſtrength of the infant increaſes, and that will be always the beſt, which, at the ſame time it gives motion to the body, appears to divert and entertain, for the ſpirits by theſe means are exhilirated, and the mind, from being amuſed, gives alſo quickneſs and ſtrength to nervous and vaſcular action—rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the child well before the fire twice a day we have ſpecified, gently ſwinging, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is highly uſeful to ſuffer little ones to roll upon carpets, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed with ſome little toy or other, that may entice their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to creep from place to place after it. This is a pleaſant exerciſe, and early teaches an active uſe of their little limbs—and I have obſerved children, ſo brought up, more early get upon their legs, and run about, than others who have been uſed to leading-ſtrings, go-carts, and contrivances of theſe kinds; it is moſt adviſeable firſt to lead them off gently by the finger, and that may be attempted at a more early period than ſome adviſe—for the idea of ſetting children upon their legs very ſoon, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions them to be crooked, is not in fact true—ſo far from that, it gives them additional ſtrength; and it has been obſerved, that the legs of children which have at firſt appeared crooked, have, by early exertions to walk, become ſtronger, and perfectly ſtraight.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe things, children ſhould often be taken into the freſh air, and remain therein for ſome time, at leaſt twice a day, and always be kept perfectly clean, changing their cloths imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

They ſhould alſo be often waſhed with cold water behind the ears, as well as other parts of the body; for, from neglect in this particular, the moiſture, which naturally collects there, becomes acrimonious, irritates, and inflames the parts, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions an acrid diſcharge, which brings on diſagreeable and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful excoriations. When it is from the neglect of this cuſtom that this complaint ariſes, which we may conjecture to be the caſe, if the child appears healthful in every other reſpect, waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind the ears with warm milk and water, or Goulard's water, or ſpreading a very fine rag, extremely thin, with ſatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine ointment, and cleanlineſs, will generally promote the cure; but ſhould we have reaſon to ſuppoſe it a drain exerted by nature for the relief of internal indiſpoſition, other management ſeems neceſſary, which we ſhall ſpecify when we come to treat on infantile diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>As we think that a vaſt deal depends upon proper Nurſing, in order to preſerve the human ſpecies, and prevent a variety of diſeaſes, which too often end fatally, or lay the foundation for various morbid affections, which are too apt to continue the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful concomitants of our future days, and embitter life through the whole of its progreſs, we have dwelt longer on this point than may to ſome appear neceſſary, but which we think cannot be too minutely obſerved; and it may not be uſeleſs to attempt to comprize the whole in a few ſhort axioms—and, firſt, we lay it down as an invariable rule,</p>
            <p>That, immediately after the birth, children ſhould be wrapped in a warm wrapper, to preſerve them from cold; afterwards, in about half an hour be well cleaned before the fire, looſely and lightly cloathed, not crammed with any dabs, but laid by the mother and ſet to her breaſt as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
            <p>That, where the conſtitution will permit, all mothers ſhould ſuckle their own children, at the ſame time not depend totally upon the breaſt, but occaſionally uſe them to the boat, or ſpoon, in order to be prepared againſt the effects of indiſpoſition, either in one or the other, ſhould they occur.</p>
            <p>That cleanlineſs ſhould ever be invariably, and conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved—children never have their ſtomachs overloaded, but be fed fully only at proper intervals, five times a day; if not, oftner, and more ſparingly.</p>
            <p>That all food, beſides the mother's milk, ſhould be of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ſimilar as poſſible to that milk, compounded of vegetable and animal materials, as aſs's, or artificial aſs's milk, cow's milk

            <p>BEFORE we enter on that part of our plan, wherein we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deſcribe diſeaſes, and lay down their moſt approved modes of cure, it will be proper to ſay ſomething on the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature of the remedies which will be recommended, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to render the knowledge in their application more ſafe, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and certain;—as well as to explain the different general terms under which they are claſſed—as to theſe general terms we ſhall be unavoidably led very often to have recourſe.</p>

               <hi>That—medicines</hi> do not always in ſimilar doſes produce the ſame effects, on diſſimilar conſtitutions—nor, before the trial, can the active doſe be diſcovered;—therefore in the exhibition of all powerful medicines, this general rule ſhould be obſerved—<hi>to begin with ſmall doſes, and gradually increaſe them, till the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conſtitutional doſe is manifeſted;</hi>—that is, till nauſea, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſome uneaſy ſenſation in the ſtomach is created, then by leſſening the doſe in a ſlight degree, the full one may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained—and this holds good in all active medicines—except ſuch where benefit is ſuppoſed to be derived from occaſioning nauſea, or ſickneſs—as occurs often in the adminiſtration of quills—ipecacuanha—and ſome antimonial preparations.</p>

For as nothing can be done effectually in the living machine without the action of the vital principle—and as we have no mode of regulating, or producing any effect upon that <hi>primarily,</hi> we are limited to direct all our operations on the parts of the conſtitution, that they may be put into ſuch ſtates, us to receive benefit from the ſalutary induence of that vital principle;—conſiſtent therefore with this idea we ſhall form our arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—which we ſhall here conciſely ſet down—leaving the full explanation of each particular, till we come to treat of them under their reſpective heads.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. MEDICINES which act upon the INERT SOLIDS by Means of the VITAL PRINCIPLE.</head>
               <p>§ 1. THE firſt of which are NUTRIENTS, from the latin word <hi>nutrio,</hi> to nouriſh.—Theſe conſiſt of all ſuch materials as are calculated to be aſſimilated to our own ſpecific nature, by the action of the digeſtive powers;—and the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which ſo aſſimilated, repairs the waſte which had been occaſioned by the different operations paſſing on in the human machine—Hence, from their affording nouriſhment, do they take their name.</p>
               <p>But theſe vary in ſeveral reſpects, either as to their being more or leſs perfected in themſelves towards the nature of animal juic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.—being of eaſier or more difficult digeſtions,—and alſo with reſpect to their fluidity or ſolidity.</p>
               <p>But though they are poſſeſſed of ſuch various properties, they are all of them reducible to one ſtate, in order to promote ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the animal; and the changes they undergo for this end are brought about by three different ways in the <hi>firſt inſtance</hi>—for <hi>firſt,</hi> the ſolid food is minutely divided, and has its texture in a great degree broken down by chewing, and farther reduced by the action of the ſtomach and inteſtines—this is called COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINUTION.—It alſo forms an union with the ſaliva, air, juices of the ſtomach and inteſtines—thoſe of the liver and ſweetbread—this is termed COMMIXTURE—and add to theſe the heat it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, by which it is thrown into the third mode, or FERMENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATION—and all this it undergoes in the firſt paſſages.—<hi>In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> it experiences great diviſibility, union, and mixture, in paſſing through the lacteal veſſels, and by the force of the lungs;—and, <hi>loſtly,</hi> it is brought into its moſt perfect nutritive ſtate by the impreſſive influence of the circulatory ſyſtem upon their contained fluids. Hence we may conciſely ſay, that the aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> or our food, for the purpoſe of nutrition, is performed by COMMINUTION—COMMIXTURE—and FERMENTATION.</p>
               <p>And from this we may underſtand why all nutritious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhould be adapted, both with regard to their quantity and quality, to the ſtrength and vigour of theſe powers collectively
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028021_0129_0FD6710510FC7708"/>
conſidered—and alſo are we taught what miſchiefs often ariſe from the indiſcreet indulgence of fond mothers, and ridiculous nurſes, who load thoſe, who are weak in ſome or all theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, too freely with food, conſidered in itſelf ſo be nutritious, in order that they may acquire ſtrength,—and by theſe means, deſtroy the effect, by large quantities being poured into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, which ſmaller proportions of the ſame food would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably ſupplied;—for if the digeſtive powers are loaded with a ſuperabundant quantity more than they can conquer, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as it were, diſeaſed; and even the ſmall portion of food, to which their powers were adequate, left in a ſtate too imperfect for affording any nutrition. And this rule is extremely worthy of attention—for valetudinarians, however proper their food, ſhould never take more than they can bear with the greateſt eaſe. Indeed, in people recovering from very ſevere illneſs, where the active powers of the habit have been greatly enfeebled, though it is always right to throw in food of the moſt nutritious nature, the moſt eaſy of digeſtion, and ſuch as ſits the moſt light on the ſtomach, ſtill ſhould we begin with ſmall quantities, increaſing them, and altering the food in proportion as the patient recovers ſtrength; and this for very obvious reaſons, which will ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as we examine the nature of our food more minutely than we have done in ſpeaking of the non-naturals.</p>
               <p>Though we have before ſaid, that perhaps our firſt food par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took moſt of a vegetable nature, yet as all ſubſtances are the more nutritious, the more they approach to that of animal, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſeems here requiſite, in order to ſhew the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they maintain with reſpect to the nutriment they afford, and the proper modes of beſt acquiring and applying them to the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>NUTRIENTS, therefore, may not improperly be arranged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three heads:</p>
               <p>1. ANIMAL 2. VECETABLE 3. MIXED.</p>
               <p>Of the FIRST—All thoſe are the moſt powerfully, and moſt quickly nutritious, which have the leaſt acidity, and are moſt elaborated, or brought neareſt to the nature of animal fluids—hence the finer juices of the older animals become the moſt eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and theſe are beſt procured by ſlight boiling, or infuſing, in ſuch a diluted ſtate as the circumſtances may require; that is, in proportion to the ſtrength of the digeſtive powers;—for, as we conſider the very fine juices of animal ſubſtances the moſt nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, becauſe more readily aſſimilated to our own nature, for very weak debilitated habits, infuſion is the moſt advantageous proceſs, as by theſe means the ſubtler parts are preſerved, which by long or quick boiling would be diſſipated—but for thoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028021_0130_0FD670D06ED78420"/>
of ſtronger digeſtive powers, there is not ſo much neceſſity for this nicety.</p>
               <p>Of theſe materials the moſt nutritious are, beef—and mutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea—as they are called—made in the following manner.</p>
               <p>Take of the lean part of beef, or mutton, one pound, cut it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thin ſlices, and let the texture be well broken, by bruiſing it, then add to this one quart of boiling water, in an earthen or tin veſſel, keep i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cloſe covered till it is quite cold—or boil them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a quick fire, for five minutes; ſeparate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>um, and decant the clear liquor for uſe;—but ſhould we require more of the ſtronger parts of them, the liquor may boil ten, fifteen, or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty minutes, and then proceed as before directed.</p>
               <p>The juices of the older animals are preferable to thoſe of the younger, becauſe thoſe of the latter are more tenacious, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not ſo much of the nature of our own fluids, conſequently yield, in that reſpect, to the former.</p>
               <p>But when it is requiſite that the fleſh of animals ſhould be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in its ſolid form—that of young ones is conſidered the moſt proper, as their fibres are much more tender, moſt eaſily broken down by chewing, and yield their nutritious part more readily to the acting powers of digeſtion.</p>
               <p>MILK, of which we have before ſpoken, pages 82, 83, though of a mixed nature, between animal and vegetable, we conſider next; for it is a fluid only half perfected, and partakes, in ſome degree, of each of the other claſſes. We have, in another place, delivered our ſentiments on the allowed degrees of preference one ſpecies of milk has to another, and have ſhewn that of aſſes to be the beſt of any which could be procured in proper quantity—we ſhall here, therefore, only obſerve, where that cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, either from the greatneſs of the expence, or the ſcarcity, of the animal, the following, called <hi>artificial aſſes milk,</hi> is not an inefficacious ſuccedaneum:</p>
               <p>Take of candied eryngo root, one ounce; pearl barley, half an ounce; liquori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e root, three drams; boil them in two pints of water till they are reduced to one, then add one pint of milk freſh from the cow, boil them gently together, and ſtrain for uſe. Half a pint of this ſhould be drank, in general, two or three times a day; but ſhould that quantity be too large, it may be reduced, and repeated oftener.</p>
               <p>The VEGETABLE CLASS has been conſidered as more difficult of aſſimilation than either of the other, becauſe it is more diſtant in its nature from our fluids; and perhaps thoſe may be found the moſt nutritious that approach nearer to milk, that is, more impregnated with oil, not eſſential—ſaccharine ſubſtance—and a ſmall portion of vegetable acid; for it is from theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028021_0131_0FD67109D9953990"/>
that all nutrition, in food of this ſort, is ſuppoſed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
               <p>We have ſpoken here, and in another place, of theſe things, merely as appropriated to afford nouriſhment only to the animal; but they muſt be allowed to have other properties, which it is neceſſary to ſpecify, as by theſe means different changes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>ANIMAL FOOD, particularly fiſh, is more ſtimulant and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caleſcent, becauſe more prone to run into that ſtate, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates pungent acrimonious ſalts, conſequently becomes more heating.</p>
               <p>VEGETABLE, more diluent and aceſcent, from its being more replete with aqueous particles, and having ſtrong propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from their very nature, to become acid—hence more cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Milk, in this inſtance, partakes more of the latter, as it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, left to itſelf, to become acid; beſides, vegetables are more emollient and ſheathing, as moſt of them abound not only with watery particles in great proportion, but alſo with thoſe which are mucilaginous; and ſeem to have inſpiſſating, or thickening powers, from their mixture with the fluids: hence, if we take in the account the quantity of fixed air with which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, we may be convinced of their utility in caſes of the ſea or true ſcurvy, and in all thoſe morbid habits, where the fluids have acquired too great degrees of thinneſs, from inherent or accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al acrimony. Milk alſo retains the ſame properties.</p>
               <p>Roaſted—broiled—or fried animal food, is more ſtimulant than boiled, and runs quicker into a ſtate of putreſcency—from the different culinary proceſſes they undergo: the firſt being prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by the action of ſtrong heat, by which means the fluids are rendered more pungent, and more highly alcaleſcent—the laſt receiving a leſs degree of heat, and through an aqueous medium, with which part of the animal juices are mixed, rendered more dilute, and leſs highly ſubtilized;—but when ſtewed down, to a great degree, and eat with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>luids with which it is prepared, it approaches nearer to the former, than when only infuſed, or gently ſimmered; nay, indeed, often exceeds them; and hence becomes alſo more difficult to be concocted or conquered by the digeſtive organs.</p>
               <p>Of the vegetable claſs, we have ſaid farinaceous ſubſtances are the moſt nutritious, and thoſe which have undergone ſome culi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proceſs, becauſe their fibrous parts are rendered more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and thoſe which are moſt eaſily aſſimilated, which contain the muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and fermentation, as they become ſweeter, and have their viſcid parts rendered thinner, and more flexile, by thoſe means are more eaſily digeſtible;—But we muſt in this place make one obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which affords an objection to what is advanced.—There are another claſs of vegetables, which are ſuppoſed to be more nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious—and theſe are the FUNGI, or thoſe fungous extuberances, called <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> or <hi>Champignons—Truffles—Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>es,</hi> named by NERO, <hi>the Victuals of the Gods</hi>—they are conſidered to afford more nutriment, from yielding, on their chemical decompoſition, materials ſimilar to animal food. DR. CULLEN ſays, <q>if they are truly vegetable matters, of which ſome have doubted, they are very different from every other vegetable with which we are acquainted—for in the firſt part of their diſtillation, without addition, they give out no acid, but a large proportion of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile ſalt;—and expoſed to undergo a ſpontaneous fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they manifeſt no aceſcency, but become immediately pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid—hence ſhew they a very near reſemblance to animal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and it may be preſumed, that they are more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably nutritious than almoſt any truly vegetable ſubſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have inſerted thus much relative to theſe fungi, in order that we may be acquainted with their particular uſes, not as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of animal food, like other vegetables, but rather as ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal food itſelf, and correctors of acidity in the ſtomach—and on this account become a pleaſing delicacy to ſuch, who are forbid the uſe of all vegetables, on account of a prevalent redundancy of acid in the firſt paſſages.</p>
               <p>All the acrid—bitter—or highly flavoured vegetables, as they conſiſt of parts which are not readily ſubdued by the digeſtive powers, but paſs in an unaltered ſtate in the courſe of circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, come more properly under the claſs of medicinal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>Under this head of Nutrients we ſhall have no occaſion to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a general catalogue, for all thoſe things fall under this claſs which we employ as food, and include whatever we eat and drink for the purpoſe of ſupporting the animal machine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing its waſte.—And if we revert to what has been ſaid in treating on aliment, p. 70, and on thoſe liquids we in common drink, p. 80, with what we have here advanced, we ſhall be ſupplied with knowledge ſufficient properly to direct us in our ſelection; for I am fully perſuaded, that we oftener err by the quantity of food that we take, than the quality; as it is certain, ſuch is the power inherent in our habits, that though our food may be in its own nature in any particulars diſſimilar, ſtill if we only ſupply ſuch quantities as are judiciouſly approportioned to
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028021_0133_0FD6710D668C4170"/>
our digeſtive powers, whatever the aliments on which we feed, they will all be reduced to the ſame ſtate, adapted to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and nouriſhing of the machine; we ſhall therefore advert to our next ſubject.</p>
               <p>§ 2. ASTRINGENTS, from the Latin word <hi>aſtringo,</hi> to bind, or condenſe, which are all ſuch ſubſtances as by their action render the ſofter parts more compact, give a greater firmneſs to the ſolids, and a coheſive tenacity to the fluids. Their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power in condenſing the ſolids is obvious from the effects which they produce in tanning, or making of leather.</p>
               <p>BOERHAAVE was of opinion, that, when applied, they bring two diſtant parts of a moving fibre into cloſer contact, and into a more firm coheſion, and this by inſinuating between each particle of the fibre another of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>Dr. CULLEN thinks, that as a fibre is compoſed of ſolid and fluid, the coheſion of the whole is increaſed by diminiſhing the watery, or by addition of the ſolid ſubſtance: but is rather a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the firſt opinion.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the addition of any ſolid ſubſtance, it may be the caſe when acting on the inert ſolids, free from the influence of the vital, or nervous power; but in the living machine, we cannot ſuppoſe medicines of this claſs derive from this ſource their operation; for under thoſe circumſtances the medicine muſt be univerſally diffuſed, and come in contact immediately with the parts upon which it acts.</p>
               <p>This, therefore, cannot be true—if we conſider the very ſmall portion of thoſe which ſhew their general aſtringent power, when taken upon the ſtomach, and the very quick mode in which they produce their effects; beſides, the variety of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which manifeſt a conſtringent efficacy, when the machine is variouſly affected from different cauſes.</p>
               <p>In proof of this we ſhall mention ſome few particulars:</p>
               <p>ALUM, when given in doſes of a few grains, has been known to ſtop profuſe bleedings, ariſing from a relaxation of the ſolids, in a ſhort ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>WHITE VITRIOL—BARK—STEEL—and ſome other of the ſtrongly acting medicines, have cauſed the ceſſation of other diſcharges, by invigorating the ſyſtem, and not from the locality of their application.</p>
               <p>PUNGENT STIMULANTS have produced inſtantaneous effects, though not durable, in caſes of laxity.</p>
               <p>SEDATIVES, or thoſe medicines which manifeſt their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects by alleviating pain, and abating the quickneſs of vaſcular
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028021_0134_0FD670D504131358"/>
action, have early ſhewn their power in the abatement of acrid defluxions.</p>
               <p>Now it appears evidently that all theſe produce their influence by their action on the ſtomach ſympathetically conveyed to the machine in general, and to the parts particularly affected, which, as being in a more morbid ſtate, they experience more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>With regard to the fluids, thoſe medicines which have the power of ſheathing acrimonious particles, from whence diſcharges have proceeded, may be conſidered as aſtringents. In fine, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will promote a contraction of the ſolids, or coagulation of the fluids, come under this claſs.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be obſerved, that many of theſe excite their action inſtantaneouſly, but do not give the ſyſtem the power of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the effect;—whilſt others act more ſlowly, ſtill occaſion, as it were, a permanency to that action in the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>VOLATILE ſubſtances—eſſential oils, and others of this claſs promote very quickly the influence of the vital powers, by which means the conſtitution very early is made ſenſible of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but as ſoon as they ceaſe to act, which they do in a ſhort ſpace, the morbid effects, they ſeem to have conquered, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produced.—Alum alſo labours under the ſame diſadvantages.</p>
               <p>But the more ſlowly acting aſtringents continue their force longer, and appear to give a ſtronger and more laſting coheſive power to the particles of the ſolid fibres, as if they increaſed their attractive influence <hi>inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From this knowledge we ſhall be able to deduce a mode of preſcribing, of infinite uſe in practice, which would at an earlier period have been conſidered as contradictory, and ridiculous, becauſe deviating from the commonly received opinion—for, from what has been advanced, we ſee that volatiles and aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents may be judiciouſly united, and will be the means of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effects of each other, by producing them ſooner, and making them more laſting—as I have often found in the courſe of practice, particularly where the conſtitution has been defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in vaſcular irritability, and nervous incitability; for, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding volatiles and pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To theſe, where the humors are acrimonious, ſheathing medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, called demulcents, may be joined;—and ſedatives occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had recourſe to, where ſpaſms attend relaxation of the ſolids.</p>

We ſhall not ſupply any formula here, from the different combination of theſe articles, but ſpecify them more particularly, when we come to treat of thoſe caſes where ſuch applications are required.</p>
                  <p>Though we have ſet down the doſes according to what is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally held proper for adults, expecting they will be varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the age and conſtitution of the patient, and the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the caſe to which they are neceſſary, one obſervation it is proper to ſubmit here, for the information of the reader; which will apply in all the other departments on the ſubject of medicine, as well as in this place.</p>
                  <p>That, as the ſame doſe of any active medicine will not be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to produce the intended effect <hi>on all conſtitutions,</hi> the doſe ſpecified being too large for ſome, and for others too ſmall—we ſhould always begin with a very moderate doſe at firſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it gradually, till the full proportion can be diſcovered; thence we ſhall be certain of deriving every advantage which the medicines can procure. Beſides, we ſhall avoid producing too violent effects upon thoſe habits which have a natural antipathy to any particular medicine, which can only be diſcovered from experience.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. EMOLLIENTS—ſo denominated from the latin word emolleſco, to grow ſoft or ſupple.</p>
                  <p>Theſe act in a mode oppoſite to the preceding claſs, inaſmuch as aſtringents give firmneſs to, theſe induce a relaxation in the ſolids.</p>
                  <p>They have been called RELAXANTS, and may be conſidered as ſuch, if we include their mode of action in a double ſenſe;
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028021_0137_0FD6710F755394B0"/>
for though they have been thought to produce ſuch a change in the ſolids as occaſioned them to be extended, more than they were before, without rupture; ſtill they have been acknowledged to reduce a part of the body, indurated and compacted in one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form bulk, into its ſtate of contained liquid, and containing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</p>
                  <p>It has been conjectured, that emollients act chiefly upon the ſolids, by introducing their particles, which conſiſt moſtly of the watery, mucilaginous, and oleaginous kind, between thoſe which compoſe the ſolid fibre, thus forcing them farther from their ſphere of attraction, and bringing them nearer to a ſtate of fluid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; for ſolids and fluids differ but in proportion to the ſtronger or weaker attractive power of their component parts.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding this may be the caſe in many, nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perhaps moſt inſtances, ſtill they may produce their effects ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally over the ſyſtem by their action on the ſtomach; for if that organ is relaxed, ſo will all the other parts, dependent upon it, without having any watery particles introduced to weaken their texture.</p>
                  <p>FEAR and GRIEF are powerful relaxants, but theſe may be ſaid to affect the mind and vital power, and hence produce their effects.</p>
                  <p>INEBRIATION has with numbers the ſame conſequence, but this ariſes from the relaxed ſtate of the ſtomach, which is ſoon taken off by ſtimulating that organ, as has before been ſpecified in the beginning of this work.</p>
                  <p>Women in general experience ſimilar miſchiefs, from repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly drinking <hi>hot tea,</hi> and other liquids under the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>EMETICS given only in ſmall nauſeating doſes, enervate, and relax the ſyſtem from the ſame cauſe.</p>
                  <p>SEDATIVES (chap. 2. § 3.) may alſo be conſidered in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree under this head.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe, however, which produce their effect upon the machine in general by ſympathetic power, will be conſidered under differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heads. Under emollients we mean to rank only ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as act from their watery, mucilaginous, and oily particles, of which they conſiſt; and theſe prove moſt effectual on the parts to which they are more immediately applied, which DR. CUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEN conceives to act in one of theſe two ways; <q>the one by being inſinuated into the ſubſtance of the ſolid, and thereby diminiſhing the denſity of the whole of the mixt, they dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh its force of coheſion. The other is, when, by being inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated into the interſtices of, or ſpaces between dry particles, they diminiſh the friction which might otherwiſe occur, and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028021_0138_0FD670D37018F530"/>
thereby render the whole more flexible. The former ſeems to be the operation of water, the latter of mucilage and oil.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe three ſeem to include all the emollients, if we were to examine the articles, multifarious as they are, which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute this claſs. Indeed, for internal uſe, the writer above ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rejects the whole, and gives the preference to the infuſion or decoction of lintfeed; which is fully as efficacious as any other.</p>
                  <p>And here, though we muſt obſerve, that as in many febrile complaints the uſe of emollients ſeem abſolutely neceſſary, where the degree of febrile affection runs very high, we are rather to adhere to thoſe of the watery, mucilaginous and farinaceous kind of the vegetable claſs, than to thoſe abounding with oil, or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſubſtances; becauſe, from heat, they are apt to grow rancid, acquire acrimony, and hence become too ſtimulant, and much increaſe the febrile effects we wiſh to reſtrain.</p>
                  <p>The catalogue of EMOLLIENTS furniſhes us with a great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ſubſtances, out of which we form the following ſelection—which, as they are ſo very ſimple in their own nature, and produce no powerful action in the habit when taken internally, require not to have any particular doſes annexed to them.</p>

                  <p>To theſe we ſhould have added the warm <hi>vapor of an animal recently killed</hi>—for we have inſtances of the arm, and other parts, put naked into the body of an animal immediately after it has been ſlaughtered, receiving great benefit, in caſes where relaxing applications ſeemed requiſite; and where many of the others had been tried without any advantage.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt emollient of all is VAPOR, either received by the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028021_0139_0FD6711102A17E10"/>
mouth, or injected by glyſter, moderately warm—and indeed it is almoſt univerſally eſteemed ſo, whether applied internally or externally.</p>
                  <p>Theſe form the claſs, it has been ſaid, of medicines which act upon the inert ſolids by means of the vital principle. That aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tringents and emollients may act upon the inert ſolids alſo, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, without the aid of that principle, in many caſes, when brought into contact with them, may be allowed—but that in the living machine they do, is much to be diſputed—and that the nutrients cannot, is evidently clear; for if that principle is defective by which the nutritious matter is applied to particular parts for their ſupport and reparation, the matter itſelf will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail but little. This ſeems clear from our obſervations on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytic limbs, receiving ſuch ſlight degrees of ſupport, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce at all benefited by the application of aſtringents or emollients, where ſuch deficiency takes place. However, in a work of this nature it ſeems not neceſſary to go too minutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſubject of ſo much intricacy; it is enough for our purpoſe to point out effects produced by the particular materials ſpecified, without being very ſolicitous of inveſtigating the preciſe mode by which they are accompliſhed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. On MEDICINES which act upon the LIVING SOLIDS by Means of the SAME PRINCIPLES.</head>
               <p>THE firſt of which are,</p>
               <p n="1"> § 1. STIMULANTS, ſo called from the Latin word <hi>ſtimulo,</hi> to prick or goad:—and theſe are all ſuch medicines as increaſe the oſcillatory or vibrating motion of a fibre, or excite the action of the moving fibres in the living animals.</p>
               <p>How ſtimulus increaſes action we cannot point out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe mode; but this we know, that all thoſe things which can increaſe the influence of the vital powers, either diffuſively or partially, are real ſtimulants, and as ſuch muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>They have been concluded to be of two kinds—DIRECT and INDIRECT. The <hi>firſt</hi> are imagined to act directly on the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fibres;—the <hi>ſecond</hi> on the organs of ſenſe, by which means a perception is excited on the common ſenſorium, which acting there, determines the nervous power to flow more copiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028021_0140_0FD670DB12EA29C0"/>
the whole, or particular parts of the ſyſtem. Theſe are the moſt common and univerſal. But ſtimulants do excite motion in the moving fibres themſelves independent of any connection with the common ſenſorium; for if the heart, or ſome other of the muſcular parts, are ſeparated from the body, they may have their action excited by the application of particular ſtimuli: this then is a certain proof of an irritable power inherent in themſelves independent of connection with any nervous power. <hi>And again,</hi> it is as clear; that a ſtimulus applied to the ſtomach will diffuſe its power to the whole habit; or if to a part, other parts far diſtant will experience its influence, as in caſes of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral heat being occaſioned by the uſe of cordials or volatile ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances—vomiting from irritation of the kidneys, &amp;c. Hence then we may fairly conclude, that action is produced by ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as well as local ſtimulus.</p>
               <p>Beſides, in many of theſe actions, mental power is the firſt cauſe, as we may diſcover in longings, deſire for that food of which we ſee others eating with uncommon reliſh; by which means the ſtomach is ſtimulated, and a ſtrong ſenſation of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is induced, which did not before exiſt—weeping alſo from ſorrow,—vomiting and ſickneſs from recollection and reflection, &amp;c. Theſe are inconteſtable proofs of the truth of our aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Hence, then, ſtimulants may be properly divided into three claſſes:</p>
               <p>GENERAL—and theſe are ſuch materials as are taken into the ſtomach, and communicate general affection through the ſyſtem, owing to the connection of that organ with every other part of the machine.</p>
               <p>LOCAL—where irritation is produced on the part affected.</p>
               <p>MENTAL—where, without the application of any material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, applied to the ſtomach, or any other part, ſimilar affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be produced by the powers of the mind.</p>
               <p>Indeed, almoſt all active medicines might be ranked under the head of ſtimulants, were we to claſs them according to their known operations; ſubmitted to different diviſions under this general term, agreeable to the effects they produce—but we ſhall confine ourſelves to ſuch ſubſtances as invigorate the ſyſtem, increaſe the action of the nervous and vaſcular power locally or univerſally,</p>
               <p>And from hence ſhall we ſee their uſe, by facilitating the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the blood through the parts in which it moved too ſlow, or was morbidly obſtructed by augmenting the force and celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the circulation—they quicken the ſenſes where morbidly affected, rouſe the mental faculties when in a lethargic ſtate, and exhilirate a deſponding condition.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>All the NUTRIENTS and ASTRINGENTS are of this claſs; and many others of the ſucceeding claſſes, though ſtimulant, are more particularly appropriated to other purpoſes, under which heads they will be arranged. The catalogue here given will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer the purpoſes to which ſtimulants, merely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſuch, are calculated to be of any uſe.</p>
               <p>But as ſome of them have been thought, by very reſpectable authority, to poſſeſs ſome peculiar powers, and are eaſily attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we ſhall beg leave to ſpecify them.</p>
               <p>HYSSOP has been reputed to be attenuant, reſolvent, pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in coughs and aſthmas occaſioned by viſcid phlegm; thought to produce expectoration, drank in form of tea, and ſweetened with honey; and to have the power of promoting the menſes attributed to it.</p>
               <p>GROUND-IVY, drank in the ſame form, or in decoction, has been eſteemed corroborant, aperient, and detergent, uſed alſo in coughs and aſthmas, to attenuate viſcid phlegm and mucus, and to brace and ſtrengthen the veſſels of the lungs; formerly much ordered in conſumptive caſes, and ulcers of the kidneys, as an efficacious remedy.</p>
               <p>PENNYROYAL. This has been conſidered cordial—of great uſe in hyſteric caſes—to increaſe the tone of the ſyſtem—and the chief vehicle for other medicines, to which were attributed the power of promoting the monthly diſcharges of the female ſex. Indeed, in this laſt caſe, by ſome practitioners, it is held in no little eſtimation.</p>
               <p>SPEAR-MINT. To this has been aſſigned cordial virtues, and a powerful reſtrainer of vomiting—tea made of this herb often anſwering this purpoſe, where every other effort has failed. It is recommended in flatulent caſes, fluxes, worm caſes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other diſorders; and, though conſidered as a ſtimulant, it is not heating, a peculiar advantage it poſſeſſes over many other of the cordial claſs. Pepper-mint ſeems alſo to poſſeſs the ſame power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="unknown:028021_0143_0FD67118CD1C4ED8"/>
HEDGE-HYSSOP. This is named a hydragogue, or an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuator of watery humours from the body—hence uſeful in dropſical caſes, and alſo worms, from its purgative power. In ſubſtance it is ſaid to promote vomiting, ſweat, and urine, to be of ſervice in maniacal and venereal caſes, after mercury had been given freely without effect—the doſe, in powder, from 10 to 30 grains.</p>
               <p>DANDELION. This has been conſidered as peculiarly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in viſceral obſtructions, particularly thoſe of the liver, as it ſeems calculated from its ſtimulant deobſtruent powers, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote bilious diſcharges—and, from experience, has been conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed highly efficacious in all biliary infarctions of the liver.</p>
               <p>WAKE ROBIN. Much has been ſaid by men of the firſt medical authority in favour of this medicine, and uſed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as promoting watery excretions, quickening circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in cold phlegmatic habits, and in diſeaſes from viſcid phlegm.</p>
               <p>In deep ſeated, fixed rheumatic pains, it has been given with ſucceſs, in doſes of from ten grains to a ſcruple of the freſh root two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>GEOFFROY and BERGIUS ſpeak highly of its powers, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring loſt appetite, curing intermittents. In the jaundice, green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs, hyſterical, hypochondriacal, and other diſeaſes, it has been found uſeful. In caſes alſo of obſtinate head-achs, which return at intervals, without fever, mixed with alkaline aromatics and abſorbents. It is given in the following manner:</p>
               <p>Take powder of wake robin, vitriolated tartar, of each ten grains powdered rhubarb, five grains. If theſe purge too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, the quantity of the arum may be leſſened.</p>
               <p>GEOFFROY uſed to give it in doſes of from half a dram to a dram; and by being boiled in vinegar, he ſays it becomes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully diuretic.</p>
               <p>LEWIS gives from ten grains to a ſcruple of the freſh root twice or thrice a day, made into a bolus, or emulſion with oily, or mucilaginous ſubſtances—it generally produced, whilſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was warm in bed, a copious ſweat. It is now kept in the ſhops made into a conſerve, half a dram of which may be given as a doſe, and gradually increaſed.</p>
               <p>Thus much has it been thought neceſſary to ſay of ſtimulants, in order to furniſh a general idea of their extenſive utility, under proper management; but as their uſes are ſo multifarious, and almoſt the whole catalogue become repeatedly under our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the ſucceeding part of this work, wherein we ſhall-be more particular in the ſpecification of their doſes, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

caſes to which they are applicable, we ſhall quit this part of our ſubject, and proceed to our next head.</p>
               <p n="2"> § 2. ANTISPASMODICS, derived from <hi>antiſpaſmata,</hi> medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines which take off ſpaſms, or what are commonly ſtiled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive affections of the human machine.</p>
               <p>Though there certainly appears a difference between ſpaſm and convulſion, as they never run one into the other; yet there have been many diſputes relative to the definition, ſo that their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions may be properly marked.</p>
               <p>Some have ſaid, if the ſolids are drawn into involuntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, and they do not continue long, but go off, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return again, theſe affections are termed <hi>convulſions</hi>—but if they remain a conſiderable time, <hi>ſpaſms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GAUBIUS defines a ſpaſm, a violent, involutary, inordinate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moving fibres; and ſays, they who diſtinguiſh a ſpaſm from convulſion, call the firſt a continued, the latter an alternate contraction of the muſcles.</p>
               <p>They have been diſtinguiſhed by the terms tonic and clonic, from the Greek words <hi>teino,</hi> to ſtretch or fix, and <hi>kloineo,</hi> to ſhake. Hence, by the former are to be underſtood, ſuch ſpaſms as are continued; by the latter, ſuch as are tremulous;—or, in other words, SPASM we would underſtand thoſe muſcular contractions which, once excited, remain in that ſtate of contractility for ſome length of time—by convulſion, ſuch as are irregular, and have relaxations and contractions alternating quickly with each other.</p>
               <p>Though this diſtinction is neceſſary to be known, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding the authors who have written ſyſtematically on the ſubject; yet ſtill it will be of little uſe in a practical view; as we ſhall find, according to the cauſe, what will be uſeful in one ſpecies, will alſo in the other. Indeed, there are ſuch a variety of cauſes, ſo very different in their own nature, which may produce ſpaſmodic or convulſive affections, that there will neceſſarily appear to be a great diverſity of medicines which ought to be ranked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head.</p>
               <p>SPASMS ariſing from laxity, are removed by <hi>aſtringents;</hi> from an over diſtenſion, by <hi>emollients,</hi> from acrimony, by <hi>demulcents,</hi> or ſuch medicines as ſheath the offending particles; from acidity in the firſt paſſages, by <hi>abſorbent,</hi> or <hi>alcaleſcent ſubſtances,</hi> which, by uniting with the acid, form a third ſubſtance, inoffenſive in its action, and thus remove the cauſe; from wind, by thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials which diſperſe wind by their ſtimulating powers, and are called <hi>curminatives;</hi> from worms, by thoſe ſtiled <hi>anthelmintics,</hi> or deſtroyers or evacuators of them, &amp;c.—but theſe are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in regard to their known action, under their reſpective heads, calculated to operate againſt, and remove the acting cauſe.

dies, are ſuch medicines as are ſerviceable, from their influence on the nervous energy, or increaſed nervous power, by remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpaſmodic contractions taking place in different muſcles; and by allaying convulſive agitations, where the cauſe is too latent to be diſcovered preciſely; or, if conjectured at, too obſtinate to be removed by medicinal applications with any degree of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; ſo that the conſtitution being relieved from the violence of theſe effects, nature may be left more at liberty to exerciſe her power for the extirpation of the operating morbid cauſe.</p>
               <p>And in our adminiſtration we muſt obſerve, where the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution appears to have an inflammatory diſpoſition, we muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſuch as are the leaſt ſtimulant; where relaxation or debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeems prevalent, thoſe which are more powerful.</p>
               <p>Beſides, as the claſs of antiſpaſmodics conſiſt of medicines dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite in ſome of their ſenſible properties—ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly foetid—others as greatly odoriferous—and are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as medicines of equal efficacy, we might ſuppoſe that there is no limitation in our ſelection—but we ſhall find that ſome will be efficacious in one conſtitution, and not in another—for where foetids agree, the odoriferous ones will, very often do not—and ſo on the contrary; therefore, where one claſs has been tried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectually, we muſt have recourſe to the other. And here alſo it will be uſeful to obſerve, that very often, for want of giving theſe medicines in full doſes, their effects have not been produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; conſequently it is proper to increaſe them, very often free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till that point can be properly aſcertained.</p>

BOERHAAVE had the higheſt opinion of it. CUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEN ſays, it is certainly an uſeful medicine. It is beſt given in conſerve, from half a dram to half an ounce, two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>SABINE. This is conſidered as a warm aperient medicine, increaſing glandular ſecretions, and a powerful promoter of the menſes. It is a very heating and acrid ſubſtance, and therefore requires much caution in the adminiſtration. Dr. CULLEN thinks it more powerfully determines to the uterus than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther medicine—of which truth experience has often convinced

me. Dr. HOME, out of five patients labouring under obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the menſtrual diſcharge, cured three, or rather four, by giving half a dram of the powder twice a day, though a dram is the doſe commonly recommended. Of the extract, from ſix to twenty grains is a doſe. Externally applied, it has been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a powerful deſtroyer of fungous excreſcences, in taking of venereal warts, where other applications have failed.</p>
               <p n="3"> § 3. SEDATIVES. This is derived from the Latin word <hi>ſedo,</hi> to aſſuage, reſt, calm; and they properly belong to ſuch ſubſtances as diminiſh motion in the ſyſtem, and the force of the moving powers—and alſo alleviate pain.</p>
               <p>Hence, whatever diminiſhes motion in a part, or in the whole of the ſyſtem, whether by rendering it inſenſible to any painful ſtimulus, or by arreſting, by any means, the impulſe of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal powers, may be called ſedative. All medicines, therefore, which cool the habit, or take off inflammation—ſome of the acids—neutral ſalts—emollients—aſtringents—and antiſpaſmodics, may properly come under this head, as they diminiſh motion in the ſyſtem—but in this place our objects are limited to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſuch ſubſtances only as are thought particularly to act on the nervous power.</p>
               <p>With regard to the preciſe mode of action of thoſe ſelected to form this claſs, we can ſay very little, as our knowledge of the nervous ſyſtem is ſo incomplete. However, thus far we may venture to aſſert, that they act either by having a peculiar power of reſtraining the violence, or rendering more equal the irregular motions of the nervous power, by their influence on the common ſenſorium, and its appendages primarily, (56) or by blunting the irritability of the living ſolids, and thus preventing the ſame power from exerciſing too forcibly its influence. And this they do either ſympathetically, by having their action more diffuſively communicated from the part they firſt affect; or by the locality of their action, when they are applied to the parts themſelves; for it has been proved, that the heart taken out of the body, has been made to act by the application of ſome ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus, and conſequently, that this power of contraction was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on ſomething foreign to the influence of the common ſenſorium, or nerves, which was certainly inherent in the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fibres themſelves; and if opium is diſſolved and thrown upon the heart ſo ſeparated from the machine, no action from ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus will take place—which proves, that, by means of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dative ſolution, irritability is deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>And it is commonly known, that if a ſmall doſe of opium be taken on the ſtomach, it will alleviate pains of the extremities,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028021_0148_0FD67159E2536638"/>
and other parts diſtant from that organ, very expeditiouſly, as well as procure ſleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> then we take the influence ſedatives have on the common ſenſorium, and the irritable power, inherent in the muſcular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the ſyſtem, we ſhall be poſſeſſed of the moſt certain known idea of the operation of medicines of this claſs; and be furniſhed with the knowledge <hi>where, how far,</hi> and <hi>in what mode,</hi> the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of theſe ſubſtances may be ſerviceable, or hurtful, in ſo far as they act as ſedatives; but it muſt alſo be remembered, that ſome of them are ſtimulants.</p>
               <p>Hence then, in all caſes where there is too great a rapidity in the circulating fluids, or pain, or ſpaſm from an inflammatory cauſe, they would be hurtful, otherwiſe they are in general ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. In caſes alſo of infarction, or ſtrong obſtruction, which ſometimes happens in the lungs, though attended with ſpaſms, they muſt be cautiouſly uſed. But where neither of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections occur, they may be allowable, and attended with uſe in diminiſhing the force and celerity of the blood's motion, where morbidly augmented, or the impetus of the blood againſt parts ſimilarly affected, in abating violent pain, and procuring ſleep ill caſes of preternatural watchfulneſs, in reſtraining inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate motions, and moderating exceſſive evacuations.</p>
               <p>But where the circulation is preternaturally languid, or there is a lethargic or drowſy diſpoſition, or a high degree of torpor in the ſyſtem, to them in theſe caſes we ſhould not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>According to the purpoſes they have been given to effect, they have received different appellations—if to alleviate pain, <hi>anodyne;</hi> if to abate it by their demulcent power, <hi>paregoric;</hi> if by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſtupor, <hi>narcotic;</hi> if by inducing ſleep, <hi>hypnotic;</hi> howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, their action is ſimilar, and requires no ſuch diſtinction. They are more properly divided into ſuch as produce ſleep, as opium, henbane, poppy; and ſuch as alleviate from their cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing property, as neutral ſalts, acids.</p>

Of all theſe medicines, however, we think it neceſſary to give a more particular account—and, firſt,</p>
               <p>The POPPY HEAD is in uſe for making a ſyrup, poſſeſſed of virtues to relieve pain, and procure ſleep—for theſe purpoſes, it is chiefly given to children, in doſes of from half a ſcruple to half a dram or more; and it will be efficacious ſometimes, where opium and its preparations are apt to diſagree with the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>It is alſo uſed for making fomentations for alleviating pain, particularly after proper evacuations in inflammations of the eyes and breaſts.</p>
               <p>OPIUM is <hi>anodyne,</hi> from its relieving moſt painful affections—<hi>hypnotic,</hi> from procuring ſleep—<hi>incraſſant,</hi> from thickening the humours—<hi>diaphoretic,</hi> from increaſing perſpiration; and, joined with ipecacuanha, antimonials, camphor, volatile ſalts, and ſuch like, the moſt powerfully ſo of any medicine with which we are acquainted—<hi>ſedative,</hi> from allaying the too great irritability of the nervous ſyſtem—and the moſt efficacious <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſmodic</hi> in the materia medica;—taken in too large quantity, it renders the nervous ſyſtem ſo totally inſenſible, produces ſuch general relaxations, that lethargy, convulſions, and death, are the conſequences; but, in a variety of caſes, given judiciouſly, it is one of our moſt noble remedies, particularly where ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous incitability, or thinneſs or acrimony of the humours are too prevalent in the conſtitution, admit too great degree of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or heat, or fixed obſtructions, do not contra-indicate its uſe.</p>
               <p>Hence the benefit ariſing from its adminiſtration in hyſteric and hypochondriac diſeaſes; in convulſions from violent pain; in too great watchfulneſs, at the latter end of fevers, ſmall-pox, and meaſles; in coughs, from acrid, ſtimulating defluxions; in looſeneſs, and dyſenteric complaints, called bloody fluxes, very often. It has been ſaid to cure the venereal diſeaſe. That in ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable habits it aſſiſts the operation of mercury, by preventing the too powerful exertions of mercurial ſtimulus, alleviating pain, and promoting inſenſible perſpiration, will not be denied, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028021_0150_0FD671600ED83F48"/>
being of itſelf curative, I cannot believe—though, after the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours have been rendered too thin and acrimonious by the uſe of mercury, I will not diſpute its power; for I have ſeen its good effects in totally removing what have been called rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic pains from that ſource.</p>
               <p>Aſa-foetida joined with opium is ſaid to weaken its narcotic effects, and prevent that ſtupor, heavineſs, and vertiginous affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which opium is apt to occaſion after its operation.</p>
               <p>Beſides, this medicine not only alleviates pain, and takes off ſpaſmodic affections, when adminiſtered internally—but when applied externally, as in fomentations, cataplaſms, lotions, lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or injections, it produces the ſame conſequences.</p>
               <p>HEMLOCK has been uſed much in ſcrophulous, ſchirrous, and cancerous caſes;—in the laſt highly recommended by Dr. Storck, as a ſucceſsful medicine, though not anſwering the expectations of the phyſicians of this country; notwithſtanding which, I he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate not to declare, I have found it in ſome degree ſerviceable in ſchirroſity—in ſcrophulous tumours, joined with bark, it has been uſeful; as alſo in ulcers, and foulneſs of the bones from that cauſe; in ſome obſtinate rheumatic caſes it has been effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and I have evidently ſeen it produce good effects in the chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough. Joined with mercury, it has been uſeful in venereal complaints, and has been ſucceſsfully given in ſome cutaneous diſorders.</p>
               <p>It is commonly given in doſes from four or five grains to a ſcruple, and puſhed on to one or two drams in twenty-four hours half an ounce has been given in that time; and, in one or two caſes, Dr. MONRO ſays, he has known an ounce. However, Dr. CULLEN remarks, and that with great propriety, that if ſome ſenſible effect is not perceived, when the doſe is about twenty grains, he ſhould diſpute the goodneſs of the medicine, and have recourſe to different parcels of it.</p>
               <p>HENBANE. This has been conſidered as a narcotic, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing heat like opium; and, beſides, it is, in large doſes, laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive—evident advantages over opium. In palpitations of the heart, it has been ſaid to be uſeful—in caſes of mania and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, in doſes of the extract from one grain to five. Though STORCK extols the remedy in ſpaſmodic affections, and profuſe bleedings; yet, from Dr. HOME's experience, it appears in theſe affections not to produce any good effects. It ſeldom produces ſleep, or alleviates pain, except till the doſe is arrived at eight or ten grains, nay, often it has been obliged to be increaſed to fifteen or twenty; though, in full doſes, it is more apt to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion delirium than opium. Sometimes it will agree where opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028021_0151_0FD6711EE97CE920"/>
will not; and it is not, except in large doſes, that its aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent effects are very remarkable.</p>
               <p>From a caſe related by Sauvages of its curing a cataract. I once, under thoſe circumſtances, tried it with evident utility; but during the trial, my patient left town, nor have I heard what was the ultimate reſult However, ſuch were its effects under my inſpection, that I ſhould, in all caſes of recent cataractous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, recommend the trial.</p>
               <p>TOBACCO, though in common uſe, and certainly conſidered as a luxury, from being chewed, taken in ſnuff, and ſmoked for pleaſure, is a deleterious and noxious herb, poſſeſſed ſtrongly of thoſe powers producing ſtupor; hence conſidered as a narcotic. It is highly ſtimulant, a powerful emetic, purgative, and promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſalivary diſcharge;—applied by way of poultice to the ſtomach, we are told it excites vomiting, and produces the ſame effects applied to wounds. In the iliac paſſion, incarcerated rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and obſtinate coſtiveneſs, thrown up into the bowels, by way of ſmoke, or in ſtrong infuſion, it has proved efficacious—and alſo in caſes of worms, particularly thoſe very ſmall white worms, called <hi>aſcarides,</hi> which affect the lower part of the large bowel, called rectum, occaſioning itching in the anus:—Indeed, it is ſaid that no remedy is more powerful in opening the bowels, procuring ſtools, and in deſtroying and bringing away theſe worms than this—though it muſt be obſerved, that given in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, it will often produce great ſickneſs and vomiting, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if puſhed far into the inteſtinal canal.</p>
               <p>In Sweden it is a domeſtic medicine, and often given to vomit and purge, in the beginning of putrid fevers. An extract made of it, which renders it more mild in its operation, has long been uſed in Germany as a pectoral in coughs—and, of late, in this country, recommended as a powerful diuretic, and of great uſe in dropſies;—but its inefficacy in ſmall doſes, and from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſevere ſickneſs and vomiting, in large ones, ſuch as were ſufficient to make its diuretic effect apparent—from the nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of its preparations, and the roughneſs of its action; it has not yet been brought into general uſe internally. External<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied, BERGIUS conſiders it as efficacious in diſcuſſing that tumefaction of the prepuce (55) called phymoſis.</p>

This claſs of medicines, ſo called from the Greek <hi>en</hi> in, and <hi>rin</hi> naſum, the noſe, or STERNUTATO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES, from producing ſneezing, are all ſuch as ſtimulate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal membrane of the noſe, occaſioning a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They act altogether by their ſtimulus; and though they have
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028021_0152_0FD6716248809AF0"/>
been ſaid to have effect upon the fluids, they do it in other way, than by increaſing the action of the ſolids on their continued li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids. Indeed all evacuants are general ſtimulants. Even theſe medicines carried into the ſtomach, or thrown upon other parts of the machine, would produce ſuch effects as were conſiſtent with their irritating power, and might vomit, produce gentle ſweat, or urine, or become expectorant, according to their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive properties.</p>
               <p>The uſe of theſe medicines, though much inſiſted on by the ancients, have, by the moderns, fallen into neglect, though they may in ſome caſes certainly be of no ſmall ſervice, either in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading the parts contiguous to the noſe, or removing obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the ſhocks given to the ſyſtem in ſneezing.</p>
               <p>Where the mucus ſecretion is defective in the noſe, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a morbid diminution, by determining the fluids there, they might be of ſervice; or by occaſioning a derivation from parts morbidly affected in the neighbourhood of that organ—alſo by agitating the ſyſtem in general, and by obviating nervous affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the convulſive or ſpaſmodic kind—but where there is great fulneſs of the habit, morbid debility of the viſcera, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſenſibility of the noſe, or ulcerations of that part, and thoſe which are contiguous, the uſe ought certainly to be forbid.</p>

In chronic and long-continued inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the eyes, in opacities, or cloudineſs of that part of the eye called cornea, beginning cataracts, and in ſome caſes of deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

Sometimes in obſtinate deafneſs they have been given with ſucceſs, with the addition of a ſmall portion of turpeth mineral, and repeated at ſhorter or longer intervals, in proportion to the effect they produce of greater or leſs violence in their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="5"> § 5. SIALAGOGUES—derived from the Greek words, <hi>ſialon,</hi> ſaliva, and <hi>ago duco,</hi> to draw forth, comprehend all ſuch medicines as produce a ſlow of ſaliva into the mouth, from the glands named ſalivary, there ſituated.</p>
               <p>They have been divided by ſome authors into three claſſes.</p>
               <p>The FIRST—ſuch as immediately act upon theſe glands, as fomentation, friction, and ſuction, either internal or external of theſe parts;—hence, moreover, cataplaſms applied to thoſe glands, called parotid, from their ſituation under the ear, and chewing tobacco moiſten the mouth;—all pungent ſtimulants alſo.</p>
               <p>The SECOND, are all ſuch as occaſion a flow of ſaliva into the mouth, by intercepting a flux of moiſture into other parts; for it is obſervable, that if any of the viſcera ſhould be obſtructed, as the liver, ſpleen, pancreas, at the ſame time the kidneys, or inteſtinal ducts, then is the mouth always moiſt—whence hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac people are called SPUTATORES, from their ſpitting ſo much; and, therefore, whatever prevents a ſecretion of lymph in thoſe places, ſhould be eſteemed ſialagogue.</p>
               <p>The THIRD CLASS takes in all thoſe ſubſtances which <hi>are ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to break down the ſanguinary maſs,</hi> and by that means ſupply the mouth with too great a proportion of fluids, thus diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Of this tribe quickſilver is the principal, and may be applied in various modes.</p>
               <p>From its external application a ſalivation may be raiſed, though in its crude ſtate—but it may be applied in form of liniment or fumigation; for if twelve grains of quickſilver are placed upon a fire, or a heated iron, they will emit a ſmoke, which, received by the noſtrils, in two or three days will occaſion a ſpitting. It may be taken internally with the ſame intent, and ſucceed, if given in a ſmall quantity; but if in too large, it is apt to paſs off by the bowels; if handled much, and for a long continuance, ſimilar effects will be produced, as we learn from gold-beaters, who make great uſe of quickſilver, falling into ſalivations.</p>
               <p>Quickſilver formed into a ſalt by ſublimation, if taken in ſmall doſes, if applied externally to wounds or ulcers, or if attracted by the noſe, has ſimilar conſequences, from its reception into the habit.</p>
               <p>It was the opinion of BOERHAAVE and others, that all theſe effects were produced by diſſolving the fluids, either by its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical action, or by its diſſolving or putreſcent power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="unknown:028021_0155_0FD67126F88AF5D8"/>
Had not theſe doctrines been previouſly refuted by ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are uncontrovertible, from the conſiderations, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical force never divides mixts, but aggregates only; that, from the minuteneſs of the diviſion of gold, even it may be made to become incapable of overcoming the coheſion of water or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wine, and be ſuſpended in them—and alſo that the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the quantity introduced would be inadequate to produce the effect. And, <hi>with</hi> regard <hi>to its diſſolvent or putreſcent power,</hi> that, during the operation of quickſilver on the habit, no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of putreſcency appear in any part of the ſyſtem—that there is no alteration of the blood in that reſpect during a ſalivation, but its texture appears as ſtrong then as at any other time;—that ſalivation is attended with an inflammation, and the blood ſhews an inflammatory cruſt; and, <hi>finally,</hi> that after the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſalivation is over, no taint appears in the blood, but, on the contrary, the perſon is in better health than before, and gives marks of a firmer ſtate of it;—one ſingle inſtance would be ſufficient to overturn them, if we conſider that a few grains of calomel has in many conſtitutions raiſed a ſalivation very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, which has continued for ſome days, nay weeks. Inſtanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of which have fallen within the courſe of my own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I cannot myſelf doubt of its producing its action in the ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glands by the means of its elective ſtimulus, though it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of exerting its ſtimulus in other parts of the machine, as on the ſtomach, inteſtines, kidneys, and perſpiratory veſſels, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, according to the parts affected, vomiting, purging, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of urine, and gentle perſpiration.</p>
               <p>Indeed, upon the whole, it ſhould be conſidered as a ſtimulant in general, in particular, a ſalivary one, and an evacuant, more peculiarly of the ſerous or lymphatic fluid, or both; and one of the moſt univerſal aperients and deobſtruents we have in the whole catalogue of the materia medica.</p>
               <p>In its combined ſtate, forming metallic ſalts, quickſilver ſooner exerts its activity on the ſyſtem, but leſs certain, I think, in its effects;—it appears more efficacious, having its parts only divided by ſome unctuous or oleagmous ſubſtances; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, its virtue depends upon its being ſo entirely unconquerable by the aſſimilating powers of the conſtitution, and capable of ſuch minute diviſibility, for it will paſs through any body except glaſs.</p>
               <p>Quickſilver, though here ranked as an internal ſialagogue, or a promoter of the excretion of ſaliva, becauſe its elective power ſeems to be more determined to the ſalivary ſyſtem, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the machine, may fairly be conſidered as an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal

ſtimulant, deobſtruent, purgative, and general evacuant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the whole of the excretions of the human body.</p>
               <p>It was thought that, from the great diſcharge it produced from the ſalival glands, and the foetor accompanying it, that it diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the texture of the blood, and diſpoſed it into putrid acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but experience proves the caſe to be far otherwiſe, as we have proved above.</p>
               <p>The great effects produced by quickſilver ſeem to proceed from its increaſing the whole of the animal excretions, and thus carrying off the virus of the pox, for the cure of which it is the moſt remarkable and certain;—and, indeed, it has been, and ſtill continues to be, by many, conſidered for this diſeaſe a SPECIFIC;—but as it will not, by itſelf, in all caſes, cure that complaint, nor prevent the venereal poiſon from taking effect, even in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions loaded with it, that idea muſt fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>Though quickſilver, in its original ſtate, is inactive reſpecting the human machine, and only has been given in this ſtate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer obſtinate obſtructions of the inteſtines, though inefficaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſtill from mechanical diviſion, as united with viſcid, oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or unctuous ſubſtances, rubbed down with dry powder calcined, or united with different acids, forming mercurial ſalts, it has been rendered extremely active; and though preparations of this abound, the chief uſe are confined to a few.</p>

or the more active preparations in very minute doſes, which in this view are conſidered as the moſt efficacious.</p>
               <p>As a purgative, <hi>calomel</hi> claims the preference, joined with rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb or ſome other of that claſs—in doſes of from 3 to 8 or ten grains; and in ſmaller doſes as deobſtruent and alterant.</p>

In ſpaſmodic complaints, united with camphor and opium, they have been ſaid to be effectual—as alſo in dropſical caſes, given in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with diuretics and aromatics, particularly the ſquill pill. But theſe we ſhall particularize more minutely when we come to treat of diſeaſes to which they are appropriated.</p>
               <p>Now, from keeping in view the peculiar virtues of this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, the reaſon will readily occur why in a variety of complaints it is ſo beneficial—as in the venereal diſeaſe—glandular obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—cutaneous complaints—obſtructed menſes—dropſy—worms—ſome inflammations of the lungs and other parts, properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and judiciouſly united with other well-adapted reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

               <p>From what has been ſaid, we ſhall readily diſcover their utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to conſiſt in diminiſhing the force of the blood againſt parts morbidly affected in the neighbourhood of the ſalivary glands; and alſo the action of the veſſels when morbidly increaſed in the neighbouring parts, as in ſome caſes of tooth-ach and rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic affections; and in promoting the circulation of the blood freely through the ſalivary glands when morbidly obſtructed there:—Beſides, as they ſo freely promote evacuation, they will be beneficial in evacuating morbid accumulations of ſerum; in producing a thorough change in the fluids of the body when mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidly vitiated.</p>
               <p>But when there appears to be an uncommon determination to the ſalivary glands—any praeternatural ſenſibility in the glands—when the ſerous part in the circulatory fluids is defective—or there is a high degree of inanition, or general debility of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, we muſt avoid uſing them.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. EXPECTORANTS, ſo named from the Latin word <hi>expectora,</hi> to throw out of the breaſt, or expectorate; and are all ſuch ſubſtances as expel morbid matter through the windpipe adhering in its branches; called bronchia (28, 29,) of the lungs.</p>
               <p>To promote which purpoſe, ſeveral particulars are neceſſary to be obſerved. It is required, FIRST, <hi>that</hi> the matter contained within them ſhould be rendered moveable, and capable of being expectorated, taking care that the moſt fluid part ſhould not be diſſipated, leſt the remainder ſhould be leſt too viſcid, and not eaſily pumped up from the lungs;—hence medicines to heating and ſtimulating are hurtful;—SECOND, <hi>that</hi> the paſſages of the lungs ſhould be open, cleanſed, and lubricated;—THIRD, <hi>that</hi> the excretion of the offending matter ſhould be promoted, which is beſt performed by coughing, to which end proper ſtimulus, and proportionate ſtrength are required;—FOURTHLY, <hi>that</hi> the obſtructed veſſels ſhould have reſt, by which means they may be relaxed—for ſhould they be continually irritated, the humour from the glands of the windpipe would be ejected with a ſort of pain.</p>
               <p>To accompliſh the FIRST intent, all aromatic bitters, and, at the ſame time, mild oleaginous ſubſtances are neceſſary, ſuch as hore-hound, hyſſop, elecampane, pennyroyal, valerian, &amp;c. and ſulphureous medicines mixed with alkalies—all fixed ſaponace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

volatile oily ſoaps, and volatile fixed ſalts, and, in general, all diluents and ſtimulants mixed together.</p>

                  </gap>, honey particularly, as it is aperient, inciding, attenuant, detergent, and lubricating—here alſo belong emulſions, ſoaps, yolks of eggs, with oily ſubſtances, ſaccharine ſubſtances, at leaſt in ſmall doſes; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe balſams, as that of turpentine, Pern, Gilead, Copaiva, &amp;c. which act both as ſtimulant and lubricating—to theſe we may add all relaxing and emollient decoctions.</p>
               <p>For the THIRD are uſeful all thoſe which excite a cough, as wine, vinegar, acrid ſpirits, ſternutatories, ſquills, gum ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And, for the LAST, demulcents, anodynes, and narcotics, are proper, of which the principal is opium; for when the windpipe is once excoriated, it is eaſily thrown into violent ſpaſms, and cough, which cannot be reſtrained by that powerful ſedative.</p>
               <p>However, we may in general obſerve, where there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory tendency, and the moving powers are torpid, ſome of the ſtronger ſtimulants are extremely uſeful, and are the things which chiefly contribute to promote expectoration; but they ſhould be very cautiouſly uſed in diſeaſes of the breaſt, and particular care taken, that the habit be free from any inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diſpoſition, or, at leaſt that no inflammation is fixed there—for where theſe take place, relaxing the veſſels, and taking off the ſpaſms is all that is wanted, for in ſuch conſtitutions the mucus itſelf ſupplies ſufficient irritation, either from its acrimony or weight, or diſtenſion of the cells of the lungs.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, the utility of expectorants appears—when the ſecretion of mucus in the lungs is obviouſly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, by promoting that ſecretion, and rendering the mucus thinner, when too thick or viſcid—where the excretion is inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, by evacuating morbid accumulations of mucus in the lungs, and ſupplying irritation to that organ when defective.</p>
               <p>When the lungs labour under a ſtate of morbid inſenſibility, by removing that, and promoting a free circulation through them, when it is there morbidly impeded.</p>
               <p>But when there is a high degree of increaſed ſenſibility in the lungs, and an uncommon quick excretion of mucus from them, the ſtimulant expectorants ought to be prohibited; and when there is too great a ſtate of torpor, of the relaxing ones we ſhould by no means make uſe.</p>

THIRD, ſuch as irritate—TOBACCO ſmoke, ACID VAPOURS.</p>
               <p>FOURTH, ſuch as lubricate and relax. See the catalogue of Demulcents, all which belong to this place.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. EMETICS. This is a Greek word, from <hi>emeo,</hi> vomo, to vomit; by the Latins they are called <hi>vomitoria,</hi> and are all ſuch ſubſtances which, by their action, cauſe the ſtomach to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject its contents upwards.</p>
               <p>The effects produced by this action have been divided into eight heads; in conſidering which we ſhall be enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the utility to be derived from the application of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies; on which, as we go along, we ſhall furniſh ſome remarks neceſſary for the more clear elucidation of different parts of the ſubject;</p>
               <p>FIRST. "Vomiting evacuates the contents of the ſtomach itſelf; though it is not eaſy to know when that is fully perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Many have got into a method of promoting few repetitions in vomiting, and giving ſmall ablutions; but it has by others been thought that frequent ablutions are required to clear the folds of various matters, or mucus, which may be detained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them."</p>
               <p>If we wiſh to evacuate the contents of the ſtomach complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, frequent and copious ablutions are certainly right; but it is ſometimes neceſſary to give gentle ſhocks only to promote ſome particular purpoſes, and theſe muſt be often repeated, ſo that it would be hurtful to puſh vomiting to its extent, as, from violent ſtraining of that organ, it would become too relaxed, and our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent fruſtrated; for it is from the repetition of the operation gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not from unloading the ſtomach, ſucceſs is expected.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY. "Vomiting cauſes a flow of liquids to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, clears it, and emulges its mucus glands." And,</p>
               <p>THIRDLY. "It not only emulges the mucus follicles of the ſtomach, and promotes a flow of gaſtric liquor, but has the ſame effect on the neighbouring glands, eſpecially the ſweetbread and the liver."</p>
               <p>FOURTHLY. "Whilſt the vomiting continues, it not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the regular motion of the ſtomach, called <hi>periſtaltic</hi> but alſo of the inteſtines, which pour out their mucus to be carried to the ſtomach, and evacuated with its contents.</p>
               <p>"Hence do we find vomits uſeful in looſeneſſes and dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but, independent of that, they are beneficial, more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as purging the inteſtines, occaſioning a greater flow of liquors into the inteſtinal canal. If the vomiting ceaſes, the increaſed ſecretion is carried off by ſtool, ſo that at any rate the adherent
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:028021_0162_0FD67169A103DBC8"/>
foulneſs is waſhed away, by ſqueezing the tract of the inteſtines."</p>
               <p>FIFTHLY. "Vomiting ſqueezes, and occaſions a conſtriction of the whole abdominal viſcera, eſpecially the meſenteric glands, (46) and in conſequence pumps the whole Lymphatic ſyſtem;—on this account increaſes abſorption, as well as from its evacuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing property; hence for theſe purpoſes emetics anſwer equally well with purgatives, and may be uſeful in dropſical caſes."</p>
               <p>But here we ſhould be careful no ſtrong viſceral obſtructions hath taken place, or any great acrimony in the humours, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of the vaſcular ſyſtem, for in theſe caſes they may be productive of the moſt fatal effects.</p>
               <p>SIXTHLY. Dr. Cullen thinks, "vomiting has the power of affecting the kidneys, for as irritation of the kidney will produce vomiting, ſo, on the other hand, it is reaſonable to think, that vomiting may alſo act upon the kidney—hence it would ſeem uſeful in propelling ſtones in the kidneys."</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding ſome have recourſe to ſuch a practice, and it appears imitative of nature, ſtill I ſhould conceive it <hi>almoſt always</hi> a dangerous experiment, <hi>always</hi> doubtful, and <hi>often</hi> not neceſſary; for if the ſtone ſhould be ſo impacted with the kidney that it cannot paſs, irritation on the part would be ſtrongly increaſed, of courſe pain and inflammation in ſimilar proportion, moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſceſs, and their conſequences. Beſides, we can never be certain whether the ſtone is of ſuch a ſize as to paſs through the ureters (50) by any propulſive force; and if it ſhould, by relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ureters as much as we can, by proper remedies, we are more likely to produce the effect, and certain to avoid all danger from too raſh a practice;—however, if the attempt at propulſion was to be made, every means ſhould be previouſly uſed to render the paſſages as diſtenſible as poſſible before the trial;—but of this we ſhall have occaſion to treat more fully in future.</p>
               <p>SEVENTHLY. "But the effects are extended, perhaps, to the viſcera of the cheſt, as expectoration has been promoted by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting."</p>
               <p>EIGHTHLY. "It alſo increaſes the conſtriction of the fauces, and forcibly emulges the whole of the ſalivary glands. It has had the effect of thoſe medicines called maſticatories, which, by chewing and increaſing a diſcharge of ſaliva, relieve rheumatic affections of the head, tooth-ach, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"By preventing inſpiration, vomiting occaſions a regurgita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood at the end of expiration. The accumulating blood, which uſually happens, produced by vomiting, is only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, and may be ſoon counterpoiſed, as will be ſeen by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering its advantageous effects on the ſyſtem in general.</p>
               <p>"During the time of vomiting, the pulſe is ſmall, weak, and
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028021_0163_0FD6712DD37A4078"/>
intermitting; but when it is over, if the ſtimulus continues, the circulation is increaſed, a fullneſs and ſoftneſs of the pulſe, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the fluids to the ſurface of the body, and ſweat;—this laſt may be ſuppoſed to proceed from an increaſed circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but Dr. Cullen thinks it may alſo from the conſent of the ſtomach and ſurface, and that antiſpaſmodic virtue takes place with regard to the extreme veſſels, which is illuſtrated from this; that emetics combined with other antiſpaſmodics, (148) as opium, increaſe the power, ſo that combined they become more efficacious diaphoretics," or <hi>promoters of inſenſible perſpiration or ſweat,</hi> "than each when alone."</p>
               <p>Theſe are their primary effects, which, if we conſider cloſely, will be productive of a variety of others, infinitely a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, than by any claſs of medicines with which we are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and indeed from them I have ſeen the moſt ſerviceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences accrue. Not but I think their uſe, in many caſes, ſhould be conſidered with the niceſt caution; for advantageous as they are, when properly applied—in the hands of ignorance, or inconſiderate raſhneſs, they become too often fatal.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the general ſhock which emetics give to the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, the evacuations they produce from the ſtomach, and the effects they have upon the nervous power, we ſhall be convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their utility; by reſtoring equality to the circulation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing lymphatic abſorption, and removing obſtructions in the ſyſtem of blood veſſels—and in theſe ſenſes they may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>irritators of the habit;</hi>—as <hi>evacuants,</hi> from clearing the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach of its contents, and morbid accumulations of ſecreted matters lodged there, and diſcharging alſo ſerous accumulations in different parts of the machine:—as <hi>antiſpaſmodics,</hi> from ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating the nervous ſyſtem, and the moving powers through the machine in general, and alſo obviating violent affections of the nervous power.</p>
               <p>But in all caſes of ruptures, or relaxations of containing mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes—in local inflammations of the internal viſcera—a high degree of morbid debility in theſe—and in fixed obſtructions, unconquerable by the force of the circulation, it has been adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that their uſe ſhould be avoided.</p>
               <p>Still, notwithſtanding all theſe prohibitions, ſo apparently well founded, from the conſideration of the action of emetics, yet they have been adminiſtered in caſes of ſchirrhous viſcera, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inflammations, and ſupernatural effuſions of blood; though in the two latter they ſhould never be attempted without firſt bleeding; though perhaps haemorrhages may <hi>now and then</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this operation; but of theſe there are very rare inſtances,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028021_0164_0FD67169E69C1C08"/>
as they are almoſt conſtantly attended by an inflammatory diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>In all congeſtions of the head, they are ſaid to be dangerous, in apoplexy, palſy, and in ſmaller collections in the veins of the brain. They would, doubtleſs, be extremely dangerous where theſe maladies ariſe from too great ſanguinary plenitude; but where from mere weakneſs of the nervous ſyſtem, or inability of the moving powers, I ſhould prefer their uſe to other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, at leaſt on their firſt appearance; nor ſhould I heſitate in preſcribing them in ſerous collections, where I was not afraid of any great relaxation of the veſſels, or ſyſtem of the ſolids.</p>
               <p>The claſs of EMETICS in uſe are not numerous—indeed, three or four, where we conſider their action only in this point of view, are ſufficient, arranging them according to their mode of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or peculiar appropriation.</p>

               <p n="8">§ 8. The next ſet of medicines in our catalogue are CATHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICS, ſo named from the Greek word <hi>cathairo,</hi> purgo, to purge, and comprize all ſuch medicines as evacuate by ſtool.</p>
               <p>Purging, ſays BOERHAAVE, is an evacuation of all thoſe things which can be thrown out of the body by ſtool from any part of the machine. And moſt authors have been very prolix on this ſubject, as the operation ſeems to be, and really is, of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial conſequence to the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>However, we ſhall content ourſelves with a more conciſe view of their effects, and from thence be ſufficiently empowered to deduce their utility.</p>
               <p>By their operation they unload the inteſtines, and increaſe the motion of the bowels downwards; by which means they clear the inteſtinal glands, and derive a greater quantity of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids, into them; they alſo empty the ſtomach downwards; they evacuate the pancreas and liver, and affect the ſpleen, and all the viſcera of the lower belly; they promote the abſorption of watery and other thin fluids, ſtagnating in any cavity; and, by continuance, purge the whole body; but in this laſt caſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce debility, if too long perſevered in; hence are preferable to other evacuants.</p>
               <p>They are apt to produce inflammation in the parts on which they immediately act. They cauſe revulſion from the head, by determining the blood into the large artery of the body, called the <hi>deſcending aorta,</hi> (29; 30) and hence may be uſeful as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the menſtrual diſcharge, waſhing of virulence in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhoea, in ulcers, by evacuating the ſyſtem in general; and in thoſe of the inferior parts, by cauſing a greater flow of liquids to the part. They excite, or, at leaſt, increaſe inflammation in the inteſtines, nay ſome propagate the ſame over the ſyſtem; and, when thrown into the blood, are moſt of them expectorant and diuretic, cauſing evacuation of phlegm from the cheſt; and urine through the kidneys.</p>
               <p>Now theſe purgative effects are produced chiefly by ſuch things as irritate the fibres and muſcular parts of the inteſtines; but <hi>paſſions of the mind</hi> will alſo promote inteſtinal diſcharge; and ſome will have that occaſioned from <hi>ſmell alone,</hi> others from <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal application,</hi> ſome <hi>from the diminution of inſenſible perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but this happens in a moiſt thick atmoſphere, and others
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:028021_0166_0FD6716EC0C065E8"/>
                  <hi>from eternal motion,</hi> as that of a ſhip or carriage;—upon the whole, it is tolerably concluſive, that purging ariſes from inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinal ſtimulus, either mental or corporeal.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding the uſe of purgatives are ſo very ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their different degrees, according to the cauſes requiring them, yet, by being too frequently renewed, they are apt to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the tone of the inteſtines, and indeed their ſenſibility. Hence are produced, if we add the conſequences of evacuation, often irregular ſpaſmodic affections.</p>
               <p>Dr. CULLEN ſays, that all purgatives are endowed with an inflammatory acrimony, not only exciting it in the part to which they are applied, but acting in the ſame manner, as poiſons; their ſtimulus, extended to the ſyſtem, produces and aggravates fever, and an inflammatory diſpoſition; and as it is chiefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the rectum, they increaſe the piles, and extend their irritation to the paſſage from the neck of the bladder, called <hi>ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are led to diſcover, from the conciſe view we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the ſubject, from whence their utility ariſes;—FIRST, as <hi>evacuants</hi> from removing any morbid retention of the contents of the ſtomach and inteſtines—diminiſhing the quantity of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating fluids, when too abundant for the ſtate of the ſyſtem at that time—and carrying off morbid accumulations of ſerum. SECONDLY, as <hi>ſtimulants,</hi> by promoting the free circulation through the inteſtines in thoſe caſes where it is morbidly imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—diminiſhing the force of the blood againſt parts morbidly affected—removing torpor in the muſcular fibres of the inteſtines—and reſtraining inordinate motion in theſe muſcular fibres, by ſtimulating them to regular and more conſtant action.</p>
               <p>But we find that ſome of theſe have, beſides the powers enumerated, thoſe which are <hi>cooling, aſtringent,</hi> and <hi>emollient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence, ſhould there be in the bowels any high degree of irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, and the circulation ſhould there be morbidly accelerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of the <hi>ſtimulating claſs</hi> we ſhould make no uſe—if the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhould be uncommonly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Before we cloſe the account of Cathartics, it may be of ſome uſe to obſerve; that, as in all conſtitutions, and all diſeaſes where too great an inteſtinal diſcharge does not conſtitute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; and a moderate evacuation from the bowels is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite; or in ſome a more copious one, it is neceſſary that we ſhould be acquainted with the particular nature of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative employed: that whilſt we are attempting to be of ſervice, by promoting the inteſtinal diſcharge, we may know what fluid each medicine will evacuate the moſt powerfully, and not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects be detrimental to the conſtitution by an improper choice—as in caſes of inflammatory complaints, it would be very injudicious to order purgatives highly ſtimulant; ſo in thoſe of bilious obſtructions of the liver from thick viſcid inert bile, to have recourſe to the ſerous and lymphatic purgatives would be injurious; as by theſe, though the intention reſpecting the operation might be right, we ſhould rather increaſe the original cauſe of the malady, by an improper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſecreted by the kidneys, and excreted by the bladder, which laſt in the repoſitory for that fluid.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the great labour different authors have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in properly ſelecting this claſs of medicines, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence with which many have ſpoken reſpecting their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtill their effects are indiſputably uncertain.</p>
               <p>How ſome things paſs off by urine ſo immediately after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken into the ſtomach, is ſtill a matter of diſpute.</p>
               <p>Some aſtringents have been conſidered of the diuretic claſs, from their action; and doubtleſs have produced this way very good effects, as the leaves of the bear's wortle berry, and bitters; nay ſome have publicly declared the power of aſtringents in expelling a calculus. As diuretics act not by diſſolving the blood, but by their local or ſympathetic ſtimulus under ſome circumſtances, I ſee no reaſon why aſtringents may not become diuretics in relaxed and torpid habits—many of the operations of the animal oeconomy may be produced by relieving the parts from any defect they may labour under, which defect may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard, or prohibit their action.</p>
               <p>Palſy of the kidneys will hinder a ſecretion of urine; torpid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in thoſe parts of the ſyſtem, or relaxation, will proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally weaken their power, which being removed, they will be enabled to act; and certainly aſtringents bid fair to produce the deſired effect. However, in order to be acquainted with their utility, we muſt now inquire what are the general effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on the ſyſtem by their application;—where there is a ſuperabundant quantity of ſerous fluids in the blood, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbents appear to be in too inactive a ſtate, they become bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, by removing the former, and increaſing the abſorbent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the lymphatic ſyſtem—hence drawing off water accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and ſtagnating in any of the cavities of the body. In ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic habits, they remove morbid acrimony from the blood, by carrying off the ſaline and putreſcent particles of the maſs of blood, which are generally diſſolved in the ſerous part of that fluid—and when there is a ſuperabundance of circulating liquids too great for the ſtate of the ſyſtem, by diminiſhing them they become ſerviceable—hence we find, their chief action is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote evacuation.</p>
               <p>When the natural ſecretion of urine is morbidly defective, they reſtore that ſecretion, by ſoliciting a flow of fluids to the kidneys, and hence diminiſh other ſecretions when morbidly augmented: and hence remove obſtructions in the canals of the urinary paſſages, and from them waſh out all acrimony.</p>
               <p>But, in order to promote their operation, they ſhould be given
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028021_0171_0FD6713AF93F6928"/>
in the moſt dilute ſtate; we might ſay, it is always proper to throw in with them much aqueous fluid, except in caſes of drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy; and, even in this caſe, there have been cures performed by drinking large quantities of mineral and common water. But where the intention of any medicine is to paſs off by urine, the patient ſhould walk gently in a cool air, and avoid all ſituations calculated to produce a determination of fluids to the ſkin; for there is ſo intimate a connection between the kidneys and the ſkin, that diuretic medicines, when thrown into the habit, will often prove ſtrong promoters of inſenſible perſpiration.</p>
               <p>According to the particular nature of the ſeparate action of diuretics, we ſhall be enabled to judge where they are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>Should there be too high a degree of ſenſibility in the kidneys, a conſiderable increaſe of urine, or any fixed obſtructions in the urinary paſſages, the adminiſtration of thoſe which are <hi>ſtimulant</hi> muſt be diſadvantageous.</p>
               <p>If there ſhould be a deficiency of ſerous fluids in the ſyſtem, the above alſo are improper, and thoſe of the <hi>cooling claſs</hi>—but where there is a redundancy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eroſity, the prohibition of <hi>dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diuretics</hi> are fairly pointed out.</p>
               <p>Though we know not of any of this claſs that will always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly exert its diuretic power, ſtill the catalogue given us by a variety of authors is extenſively prolix;—we ſhall ſelect ſuch as are conſidered the moſt efficacious according to the particular ſtates of the conſtitutions which may require them;—and theſe we ſhall compriſe under three heads—of <hi>ſtimulant, cooling</hi>—and <hi>diluent.</hi>

               <p>§ 10. DIAPHORETICS, derived from the Greek <hi>diaphoreo,</hi> transfero, to carry through, include all ſuch ſubſtances as increaſe perſpiration, or ſweat. This claſs uſed to be divided from ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriſics, or ſuch medicines as promoted ſenſible perſpiration, but unneceſſarily; for they ſeem only to differ in their degrees of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, promoting the ſame effect, more or leſs copiouſly or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly. But as different purpoſes may be anſwered by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of action of thoſe parts which produce theſe effects, it may be neceſſary to make ſome ſpecification reſpecting the two.</p>
               <p>Inſenſible perſpiration is promoted by all ſuch materials as produce an aſtringent effect upon, or contract the ſolids in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree, by occaſioning an increaſe of elaſticity or ſpringi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the veſſels, and thus promote the circulation—hence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> bark—all the aſtringent roots—auſtere wines—come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this diviſion, as do exerciſe which is moderate, either walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, riding on horſeback, or in a carriage—mild ſtimulants, or thoſe of the ſtronger claſs weakened.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="unknown:028021_0174_0FD6717503F5C758"/>
Or, by ſuch things as determine the matter of perſpiration to the ſkin, ſuch as moderately warm air, temperate exerciſe, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual circulation of the fluids when the body is at reſt, as well as in motion.</p>
               <p>Or, occaſion ſuch a temperature of the ſkin, that it ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be too relaxed nor more rigid than requiſite—hence fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, lotions, and deterſion are recommended; and it is from producing this effect that theſe things are found ſo beneficial to the ſtudious, inactive, and thoſe who are advanced in life—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading the ſyſtem by thoſe means, without weakening it in the ſmalleſt degree, but, on the contrary, increaſing its power.</p>
               <p>Now SWEATING is promoted by nearly the ſame means, for all ſuch things as relax the veſſels, and determine powerfully to the ſkin, will produce this effect, whether internally or external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied.</p>
               <p>Hence come under this claſs all thoſe diuretics which act not upon the kidneys electively—warm water, or barley-water ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with honey, excite a copious ſweat—a glaſs of cold water drank going to bed—alſo thoſe things which take off ſpaſm, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are demulcent, or moderate or correct acrimony, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium—teſtaceous powders. All ſtrong frictions, warm vapor, particularly of water, warm bathing, or whatever will render the ſkin relaxed or ſoft.</p>
               <p>Nitre, and its preparations, and all thoſe ſubſtances which diſpoſe the veſſels to act upon their contained fluids—thus vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſweetened with honey, and diluted with water, is the beſt ſudorific in acute caſes, and was a favourite remedy preſcribed by HIPPOCRATES, in the following form, called HYDROMEL, from <hi>udor,</hi> water, and <hi>mel,</hi> honey:

                     <label>each one ounce.</label>
                     <item>

               </p>
               <p>Mace, a ſmall portion, to give it an agreeable flavour.</p>
               <p>Water, twelve or fourteen ounces; let this be drank in bed after the manner of tea or coffee; and the patient there wait the reſult.</p>
               <p>Care though ſhould be taken, that honey does not diſagree with the conſtitution; for, where there is any natural antipathy, it is apt to produce violent affections on the ſtomach and bowels; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar ſhould therefore, in theſe caſes, ſupply its place, or treacle will have a better effect. Whatever is taken hot, as well as heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aromatics, opiates, as alſo violent motion, are highly ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſuch things as diminiſh the external preſſure of the air, and thoſe which increaſe the ſtrength of the heart, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to its number and force of pulſations, come under the head
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028021_0175_0FD6713E38293E38"/>
of ſudorifics—ſuch as Rheniſh wine, freſh juice of citron, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating aromatics, volatile ſalts, &amp;c.—thoſe things which ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late externally, as all acrid matters applied to the ſkin, as vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and ginger, which is the moſt ſubtile and penetrating, and much recommended by HELMONT—and laſtly, whatever, reſtores impeded motion in the internal parts, as paſſions and affections of the mind reproduce retarded perſpiration.</p>
               <p>Though a number of the medicines mentioned above are ſtiled diaphoretics; ſtill, ſtrictly ſpeaking, and conſidering them as ſuch, independent of their connection with ſudorifics we have no one of which we can ſpeak with any certainty that has been tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſtatical experiment, the only mode we have of diſcovering them, except AS A FOETIDA, as handed down to us by SANCTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIUS—yet I ſhould ſuppoſe, that the power of all ſudorifics weakened might be juſtly conſidered as diaphoretics; for we find all thoſe things which can increaſe the circulation, determine the fluids externally to the ſkin, and take off the ſpaſm from the minute veſſels, are certainly entitled to the character of diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics and ſudorifics; and theſe three particular circumſtances ſhould be adverted to, when we want to promote a diſcharge of this ſort for any good purpoſe; for though ſtimulants and ſeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or medicines poſſeſſing both theſe powers, may in many caſes be very proper, they may in ſome, conjunctively or ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, be detrimental—and indeed there may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints where ſweating would be improper, though the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gentle perſpiration might be uſeful, as in the ſcurvy—but in the venereal diſeaſe, if the effect could be produced with eaſe, ſweating is the beſt method of cure, and preferable to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evacuation by ſtool, or ſalivation.</p>
               <p>From what has been advanced, we ſhall find that all general ſtimulants of the ſyſtem, as motion and heat, are powerful ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifics;—particular ones are either applied to the excretories, thoſe pores from whence the ſweat iſſues, or to the parts conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, as the ſtomach and inteſtines; hence their action is either general, local, or ſympathetic.</p>

internal viſcera—removing various cauſes, which obſtruct or impede the natural ſtate of the circulation on the ſurface of the body, and there reſtoring the natural diſcharge—and alſo from their evacuating power, leſſening the quantity of the circulating fluids, when too great for the powers of the ſyſtem—reſtoring lymphatic abſorption—and diſcharging any morbid accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſerum.</p>
               <p>But ſhould the ſyſtem be uncommonly relaxed, a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the determination of fluids to the exterior ſurface of the machine—a great want of fluids—or the force of the blood on the baſis of the brain much debilitated, the prohibition of their uſe is obvious.</p>

               <p>A great deal has been written, and much time waſted, by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, in endeavouring to account for the preciſe manner in which nature performs this operation in the female machine: the only preſent ſatisfactory concluſion we have on this head is, that a fullneſs of the uterine ſyſtem, from a peculiar determination of the blood to that organ, a permeability in the uterine and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal veſſels, and an increaſed impulſive power, all periodically exerted, are neceſſary for the ſalutary promotion of that diſcharge—and when there ariſes a deficiency in all or any of theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, obſtructions will take place, which require the aid of that claſs of medicines of which we are now to treat;—but as there are various purpoſes often to be anſwered, e'er we can promote the deſired end, different medicines have been pointed out, and formed into diviſions according to their action.</p>

               <p>The irritating and antiſpaſmodic are only to be called in aid, when there is an aggravation of the ſymptoms, and an effort of nature at her accuſtomed time. The reaſon of which is clear—becauſe the former are conſidered only as preparatory, that by their operation the conſtitution may be put into ſuch a ſtate, as to be enabled to feel, and anſwer to the effects produced by the more powerful and forcible action of ſuch medicines as add vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to the circulatory veſſels, puſh forward the blood quickly and rapidly, and take off any obſtructions which may be cauſed by ſome ſpaſmodic affections.</p>
               <p>According, then, to the difference of the conſtitution we wiſh to relieve, ſo muſt we make our ſelection.</p>

               <p>There is another claſs which we muſt have recourſe to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly where there appears to be a ſcarcity of the ſanguinary maſs, in order, as far as in our power, to increaſe the general volume of fluids, that the peculiar determination may with more eaſe be brought about, and this is the claſs of NUTRIENTS, ſelecting ſuch to which the digeſtive powers of the conſtitution appears adequate to aſſimilate.</p>
               <p>If now we call to our recollection what has been delivered—the means by which theſe appropriate remedies are rendered ſerviceable, will be—from promoting freely the circulation of the blood in the neighbourhood of the uterus, when too much obſtructed there—from increaſing the accumulation in the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine veſſels themſelves, which is neceſſary to the menſtrual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge—and removing morbid obſtructions to the paſſage of blood
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028021_0179_0FD67143354B0548"/>
into the cavity of the uterus—alſo, from augmenting the ſtrength of the ſyſtem in general, particularly of the veſſels of the uterus, when defective—and removing any ſpaſmodic conſtriction taken place in them.</p>
               <p>But ſtrong objections may often ariſe to the uſe of ſome of this claſs—if the rectum ſhould be in a particular irritable ſtate—or there ſhould be any local inflammatory affection, we muſt avoid thoſe which are irritating—If the blood circulates with great force, or there ſhould be particular debility of any other parts, the <hi>ſtimulant</hi> muſt be avoided; nor muſt thoſe denominated <hi>tonic</hi> be meddled withal, if there ſhould be any morbid rigidity in the ſyſtem.</p>

               <p>WE are arrived at the third part of our arrangement, and muſt proceed now to treat on MEDICINES WHICH ACT UP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON THE FLUIDS THROUGH THE SYSTEM, in the ſame manner as we have before ſpoken on thoſe which acted upon the ſolids; and theſe include ATTENUANTS INSPISSANTS—and DEMUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENTS—And, firſt, of</p>
               <p>§ 1. ATTENUANTS, from the Latin <hi>attenuo,</hi> to make thin,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028021_0180_0FD6717C4FD6D710"/>
perfectly expreſſes the nature of all the medicines of this claſs, and comprehends whatever can be underſtood by <hi>diluting, incid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>reſolving</hi> medicaments; three terms into which this claſs have been, by many, divided, becauſe they all contribute to render the fluids more thin and fluxile.</p>
               <p>Butas this point may be accompliſhed in two ways, either by ſubſtances mixing with a fluid, and rendering it more thin, but not changing or altering the particles of which it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; or having the power of diminiſhing the coheſion of the blood, and thus rendering its texture leſs firm and tenacious; they may be certainly, and ought to be divided, according to their action, into <hi>diluent</hi> and <hi>reſolvent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the firſt we cannot be properly ſaid to have any other than water, which is productive of a variety of good effects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the habit—but not merely by its diluting property, it acts more particularly, immediately, and univerſally, by its coldneſs. Now, as a diluent, it not only thins the fluids in the way we have above ſpecified, but it aſſiſts digeſtion, (106) quenches thirſt—is an univerſal vehicle for ſolid food, corrects acrimony—pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes fluid ſecretions—and is by many eſteemed, much more than any other medicine, an univerſal remedy.</p>
               <p>Now, as it is clear that all diluents ſhould be more fluid than the humours which are by their intervention to be rendered thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and have at the ſame time, when mixed, the property of making them retain their acquired fluidity—we ſhall find, there is not any thing except water that poſſeſſes this power.</p>
               <p>Though wine—oil—ſaline ſubſtances—fermented ſpirits—and ſome earthy ſubſtances have been ſaid to enjoy theſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſtill it is obvious, that they are defective, and have not them in that degree ſo as to become really diluent—for wine, as a diluter, depends upon its watery particles joined with its ſtimulating power—oil renders the maſs of fluids rather more viſcid—ſaline ſubſtances reſolve by their ſtimulus—fermented ſpirits are more apt to coagulate—earths are of themſelves ſolid and inert, and can never be taken in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ew, but as they may mix with ſome acidities in the ſtomach and inteſtines, and thus change their form, and become active from their aſſuming that of neutral ſalts, and with them may they be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; therefore it is to water we muſt reſort, when we wiſh to call in aid alone a purely diluting power—to which, it has been ſaid, if we add gentle heat, or ſaline particles, as ſea ſalt, Polychreſt ſalt, ſal ammoniac, or borax, we ſhall improve its power, by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſtimulating effects, but this is adding a reſolvent property—Moderate motion is alſo ſaid to improve its powers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:028021_0181_0FD6714832B1EBA8"/>
But as for reſolvents, they act by increaſing the force of the moving powers by the ſtimulus they poſſeſs in a limited degree; for ſhould they act violently, they would, by diſſipating the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the fluids, render them thicker, and become incraſſants; but by gently ſtimulating, though they produce evacuation, they permit the veſſels to act more freely upon their contained fluids, and hence become reſolvent.</p>
               <p>On conſidering the action of this claſs, we ſhall be empowered to diſcover, that their beneficial effects ariſe, from removing any morbid viſcidity in the blood, and reſtoring a free circulation, when in the ſmall veſſels it is morbidly obſtructed—from increaſing the quantity of ſerous evacuations, when too greatly diminiſhed—and rendering them, when too thick and viſcid, more fluid.</p>
               <p>But their uſe muſt be prohibited in conſtitutions labouring under too great thinneſs of the general maſs of fluids—having a propenſity to morbid ſerous accumulations—or a remarkable increaſe of ſimilar ſecretions.</p>

               <p n="2">§ 2. INSPISSANTS—theſe are alſo called INCRASSANTS—from the Latin words <hi>inſpiſſo</hi> and <hi>incraſſo,</hi> to thicken. Theſe terms, like the former, give us a perfect idea of their import—from whence we underſtand all ſuch ſubſtances as give a degree of viſcidity, to the circulating fluids.</p>
               <p>From experience we know that our fluids do ſometimes run into a ſtate of morbid thinneſs; but by what means, is very doubtful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:028021_0182_0FD6717DB4F53C58"/>
Some have ſuppoſed it to ariſe from too great a proportion of fluid aliment; whilſt others have been led to believe, it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from a retention of ſome of the ſerous ſecretions. But if we reflect, that children and many adults live upon food totally liquid almoſt, yet no ſuch appearance is the reſult; and that nature always ſupplies the defect of one ſecretion by the increaſe of ſome other, and the retention muſt be partial, it cannot be univerſal; both theſe opinions ſeem by no means ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>I rather think that it is occaſioned by a relaxation of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, particularly of ſome, or the whole of the digeſtive organs; for ſtrong, muſcular, laborious ruſtics, whoſe digeſtive powers are good, have generally, nay, I believe always, the blood ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the oppoſite extreme—whilſt the more delicate and relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoſe digeſtive powers are weak, have the ſanguinary maſs too fluid: indeed people whoſe blood has poſſeſſed a proper tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have, from illneſs, had it reduced to a ſtate manifeſting a too weak coheſion, and that apparently by the ſyſtem being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated.</p>
               <p>Whatever may be the cauſe, it is our buſineſs to remedy the effects; and theſe we attempt by reproducing a proper proportion of viſcid fluids, and by increaſing their attractive power one with another; and their conſequences may, we think, be acquired by the following catalogue of INSPISSANTS:

               <p>It has been remarked by ſome authors, that acids—wine—al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chohol—and in ſome meaſure, the aſtringents uſed internally, have been ſaid not to produce their inſpiſſating effect; and ſhould therefore only be employed externally, in caſes of profuſe bleedings; and that the nutritious and demulcent claſs, of which
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028021_0183_0FD6714956C865C0"/>
we ſhall next treat, muſt, for reſtoring the viſcid fluids, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon.</p>
               <p>However, I cannot avoid thinking the whole, alchohol except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may be uſed with much advantage; and greatly aſſiſtant in rendering thoſe, which act merely on the blood, more quickly efficacious, by invigorating the ſyſtem, increaſing the ſtrength of its vaſcular power, and conſequently the action of the veſſels upon the contained fluids.</p>
               <p>On this head authors have confined themſelves to ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as were either <hi>farinaceous,</hi> as barley, wheat, rye, and ſuch—or <hi>mucilaginous,</hi> as marſh-mallows, gum arabic, iſinglaſs, &amp;c. and conceived their utility to be derived from removing morbid tenuity in the blood—preventing the tranſmiſſion of red blood through veſſels not naturally fitted to receive it—diminiſhing the quantity of thoſe ſecretions which were ſerous, and too copious, and rendering them more viſcid where morbidly thin and fluid—and have prohibited their uſe in morbid viſcidity of the blood—preternatural diminution of the ſecretions in general—and a high degree of debility of the digeſtive organs.</p>
               <p>I am perſuaded that in many caſes, particularly in thoſe where a weak digeſtion is prevalent, the uſe of ſome of the ſtimulant aromatics, mixed with the invigorating aſtringents, ſuch as bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, bark, iron, would greatly conduce to conquer many of thoſe defects for which incraſſants are preſcribed, and I have repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen their good effects; indeed I very often unite them, and find, that, conjoined, they prove more efficacious than when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered ſeparately.</p>
               <p>§ 2. DEMULCENTS, from <hi>demulceo,</hi> to appeaſe or mollify. Theſe by ſome have been conſidered to act in a double capacity, by blunting or ſheathing the acrid particles of our morbid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or promoting an entire change in ſuch as were offenſive from their acrimony, and forming a third ſubſtance, perfectly different in its nature with reſpect to its action. Hence have they been ranked as general and particular demulcents. In the latter claſs are enumerated all the acids and alkalines, as well as ſome metals, with regard to their influence on each other; as if one was creative of any diſturbance in the habit, by exerting a morbid ſtimulus from its acrimony, the other on being given proved corrective, and cured the affection; hence was ſtiled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulcent; but theſe are more properly arranged under other heads, as the antalkaline and antacids, of which we ſhall ſoon treat in their ſeparate places.</p>
               <p>At preſent we ſhall conſider them only as obtunders of, or blunting acrimony, by mixing with and preventing the acrid
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028021_0184_0FD6717F4D03CD68"/>
part of the fluids from exerting themſelves on the ſolids, ſo as to create pain, or other uneaſy ſenſations.</p>
               <p>And it will appear then, that of all this claſs, in this view of the ſubject, are either mucilaginous, oily, or a compoſition of both; and theſe manifeſt their action immediately in the ſtomach or inteſtines; or, after having paſſed through the circulation, in the ſecretory organs.</p>
               <p>For it is imagined, that acrimony takes not place in the blood veſſels, but in the ſecretions, as the ſerum is thought to be the vehicle of acrid ſubſtances. Theſe demulcents, therefore, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the blood are ſeparated with the ſerous, or thinner parts of the fluids, in thoſe places of the ſyſtem where ſecretions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; and thus, by enveloping the irritating particles, prevent them from ſtimulating.</p>
               <p>Thus they defend the kidneys, the lungs, the veſſels of the vagina and uterus, in nephritic or gravelly complaints; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions on the lungs; and caſes of the whites; and are highly uſeful in haemorrhages, which are often maintained by acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for increaſed ſecretion of mucus is always acrid, till its thinner parts are diſſipated, by lying ſome time—hence their uſe in coughs, defluxions on the breaſt, the whites, and thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges after child-birth, called lochial.</p>
               <p>Whatever good we may perceive can be derived from medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of this nature, may be acquired from ſome of the following ſelection of DEMULCENTS:

though theſe laſt can ſcarce be ſaid to act in the mode we have deſcribed of common demulcents; but rather take off the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony by diminiſhing the ſenſibility of parts; and produce a viſcoſity of the ſecreted fluids, it is obvious from the appearance of the matter, in thoſe who have taken opiates, after their nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotic effects have ceaſed.</p>
               <p>And this I take to be owing to the veſſels being by their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thrown into a ſtate of torpor, and thus ſuffering the ſecreted fluid to become more denſe by its continuance, and conſequently leſs acrimonious from the diſſipation of its more ſerous parts.</p>
               <p>They have been divided into LENIENT DEMULCENTS, ſuch as
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028021_0185_0FD6714AC049A390"/>
Starch, Gum Arabic, Olive Oil—and thoſe which are DILUENT, as Water, and watery ſubſtances; but theſe laſt come not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly under this head, without being mixed with ſome of the former; as they are apt, without ſuch mixture, to paſs off too quickly by ſome of the emunctories.</p>
               <p>The uſe to be acquired from the adminiſtration of theſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials are, a diminution of the action of the ordinary ſtimuli upon parts affected with too great ſenſibility, and a ſupply of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural coverings of the parts where too defective—diminiſhing morbid acrimony in the ſyſtem in general—and rendering more mild thoſe ſecretions which are praeternaturally, or too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acrid.</p>
               <p>But their adminiſtration would be pernicious, if there was any defect of a natural pungency in the ſecreted fluids—a great degree of viſcidity in the coverings of the ſenſible parts—or an uncommon want of ſenſibility in the excretory organs.</p>

               <p>WE are now come to our fourth diviſion, wherein we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to conſider</p>
               <p>MEDICINES WHICH MANIFEST THEIR SENSIBLE ACTION CHIEFLY, IF NOT SOLELY, IN THE FIRST PASSAGES RESPECT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING THE FLUIDS.</p>
               <p>The firſt of which preſent themſelves to our view are,</p>
               <p n="1"> § 1. ANTALKALINES, from the Greek words <hi>anti,</hi> againſt, and <hi>alkali,</hi> alkalies, conſequently all acids and aceſcent materials come under this deſcription; as do all ſuch medicines as conquer alkalies, and deſtroy their power of action as ſuch. But in this place the acids and aceſcents are only to be conſidered as correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of alkaleſcent ſubſtances; for we have before ſeen the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified power they appear to maintain as <hi>aſtringents, ſtimulants, ſedatives, inſpiſſants, cathartics, diuretics,</hi> and they will alſo rank with <hi>antiputreſcents;</hi> at leaſt ſuch of them as have been ſelected agreeable to the effects they have been thought to produce on the human machine: and here their chief action appears to me to be in the firſt paſſages only, where, coming in contact with alkaleſcent ſubſtances, there they neutralize them.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, that where there happens to be, from any diſeaſe, an alkaleſcent ſtate of the fluids, they are not of much ſervice by acting in them merely againſt, and correcting ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaleſcency; for when our fluids are affected to any conſiderable degree with this, little is in our power; but in caſes of this kind,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028021_0186_0FD67181159471D0"/>
ſhould they be of any ſervice. I am perſuaded it is more from their action communicated to the ſolids, particularly the mineral acids, than from any other cauſe. Perhaps the utility derived from the native acids depends more upon the fixed air, with which they are replete; for we have not a more powerful cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of putreſcent acrimony than this ſpecies of air.</p>
               <p>They have been divided into vegetable and ſaline antalkalines—but the better diviſion is, into native, of which ſorrel, barber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and tamarinds, form examples—and into artificial, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid of vitriol, ſea ſalt, nitre, and vegetable.</p>

And likewiſe the whole claſs of DEMULCENTS; but theſe act by mechanical, not chemical mixture—that is, from merely mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with and ſheathing the offending particles, not from altering them, by forming a new combination, ſo that each body loſes totally its natural properties, and becomes a third, differing from
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028021_0187_0FD6714DF3CC6040"/>
both—and, perhaps, ſome others here ſpecified, may act in the ſame mechanical mode.</p>
               <p>It will, from this conciſe view, appear obvious from whence the whole of the virtues of this claſs of medicines may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected—and where their uſe ought to be prohibited—<hi>their power</hi> of neutralizing alkalies.</p>
               <p>For, ON THE ONE HAND, by this power they are capable of removing any ſenſation of alkaleſcency in the firſt paſſages—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the natural diſpoſition to acidity in the ſtomach—and correcting in the alimentary canal praeternatural putreſcency.—ON THE OTHER, if there ſhould be, from an acid cauſe, any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſpoſition in the ſtomach to that painful ſenſation, called CARDIALGIA, an uncommonly ſlow and languid circulation, or any conſiderable diminution of animal heat, theſe defects they would increaſe; conſequently, under ſuch circumſtances, ought to be prohibited.</p>

               <p>Though moſt of theſe act by coming in contact with the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acid immediately, without conſidering the ſolids—yet thoſe under the general titles, except the demulcents, which become ſerviceable by their ſheathing property, produce their effects by the influence they have on the moving powers, which we have in their proper places before ſpecified.</p>
               <p>As the action of theſe, like the former, is ſo very limited, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be conſidered in this place as counteracting acidity in the firſt paſſages, we ſhall have occaſion to ſay little more than will be ſufficient to ſhew where they will be beneficial, or in what caſes their exhibition would be improper.</p>
               <p>When there is a morbid prevalence and ſenſation of ſourneſs in the alimentary canal; when, from the ſame cauſe in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the natural appetite is vitiated, and the action of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and inteſtines is diſordered, they are of ſervice in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former, and reſtoring the two latter to their healthful ſtandard.</p>
               <p>But when there is a prevalence of alcaleſcency in the ſtomach and bowels, or a tendency to putridity in the general maſs of blood, they muſt be highly detrimental. And, perhaps, in this laſt caſe, the miſchief which would ariſe from their uſe may be more owing to the deſtruction of the acid in the firſt paſſages, than from joining in their alcaleſcent ſtate with the fluids, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids have been conſidered antiputreſcent.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. ANTISEPTICS, from <hi>anti,</hi> againſt, <hi>ſeptica,</hi> putrefaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia, ſubſtances occaſioning putrefaction. Theſe include all ſuch materials as obviate the too great putreſcency of our fluids.</p>
               <p>Now as the putreſcency of our humours may be brought on by exceſs of heat and motion, as well as receiving any putrid ferment into the vaſcular ſyſtem—as it, when once fixed, and begun to exerciſe its deleterious action, induces languor and great debility in the moving powers, we may ſee the reaſon of our antiſeptic claſs of medicines, exhibiting, according to the conception we have of their action, ſuch apparently contradictory views—for in the ſame arrangement we ſhall find, that we have the <hi>volatile ſalt,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>neutral kind</hi>—the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as highly heating, and a ſtrong ſtimulant of the moving powers—the other as cooling the ſyſtem, and mitigating vaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:028021_0189_0FD67151C3B50538"/>
From thence I preſume, that they are only applicable in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtages of putreſcent action; or in different conſtitutions affected with putrefaction;—and not unlikely the ſame may hold good with acids and alkalies, for they are both enumerated under antiſpaſmodics. Of theſe different ſubſtances it therefore behoves us to be careful in the application.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſtages, <hi>where a putrid tendency</hi> may be accompained <hi>with high degrees of circulatory motion and heat,</hi> or in conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where theſe are prevalent, neutral ſalines and aceſcents may be the moſt proper; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>in languid habits,</hi> or thoſe made ſuch by the continuance of the enervating power of putrid particles, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiles and cordials challenge the preference.</p>
               <p>Nitre has been ſaid to be ſtrongly antiſeptic, when applied to inanimate animal matter, but not ſo in the living ſubject, as it leſſens the powers of the vital actions—but this is only applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the advanced ſtage of putreſcency; and it is to that ſtate of the diſeaſe alone they muſt mean to advert, who advance, that cordials, and whatever invigorates the ſolids, by increaſing the vital heat, are properly antiputreſcent, and by what alone relief can be obtained in putrid complaints.</p>
               <p>However, our chief intent in theſe caſes is to keep up a due action of the moving powers, and a proper tone of the ſolids, that is, an active firmneſs—which effects, we conclude, may be produced by the ſubſequent ſelection of ANTISEPTICS:</p>

               <p>IN our fifth and laſt diviſion we include MEDICINES WHICH PRODUCE THEIR CONSEQUENCES BY EXTERNAL APPLICA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION;—OR ON SUBSTANCES FORMED WITHIN THE MACHINE, THOUGH LODGED WITHOUT THE VERGE OF CIRCULATION. The firſt of which we ſhall conſider are,</p>
               <p>§ 1. EPISPASTICS, or VESICATORIES, from <hi>epiſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>,</hi> to draw, and <hi>veſicatorium,</hi> as raiſing a bliſter. They are therefore ſtimulants, in the firſt ſenſe, locally ſuch; and, if continued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come evacuants.</p>
               <p>But their action is not confined to thoſe places where they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately act; they communicate that action to the ſyſtem in general, and often in particular to the urinary paſſages; but this effect is chiefly produced by cantharides, or Spaniſh flies.</p>
               <p>They have been formed into three diviſions, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as only occaſion heat in the part—of which claſs may be conſidered the ſlighter ſtimulants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such which create heat, with ſome degree of inflammation, as Horſe-radiſh—Muſtard—Volatile alkali.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe which raiſe bliſters, as cantharides, Euphorbium;—to which may be added a fourth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe which produce a diſcharge of pus, as Setons and Iſſues.</p>
               <p>They are often applied with different intents, either as they act on the nervous power, alter the balance of circulation, or produce evacuation; hence are their particular uſes diſcoverable;—in removing torpidity, or languor in the ſyſtem—conquering the effects of more than uſual ſenſibility—decreaſing violent pain—weakening the circulatory force of the blood againſt any part morbidly affected—and alſo of action in veſſels of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of thoſe to which they are applied. They alſo decreaſe the volume of the circulating fluids when too great in the habit, and evacuate morbid accumulation of ſerum.</p>
               <p>But ſhould the ſyſtem be in general highly irritable, the blood praeternaturally thick, or the fluids in general too defective in quantity, theſe circumſtances demand the prohibition of their uſe.</p>
               <p>§ 2. PHLEBOTOMIA, bleeding, from <hi>phleps,</hi> vena, a vein or artery, and <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>o,</hi> ſeco, to cut.</p>
               <p>Under this term are arranged all thoſe modes by which blood is evacuated from the machine by the medical art; and theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> operations are conſidered as either producing general or partial
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028021_0192_0FD6718C90DA83A0"/>
effects, by relieving the ſyſtem in general, or only in ſome of its parts.</p>
               <p>The diviſion of this claſs has commonly been general, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, or local; and inſtanced, in opening a vein, or an artery, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> belong to the firſt; as to the ſecond, ſcarifications, or cupping-glaſſes, which are called <hi>cruentae,</hi> from the drawing blood—and the application of leeches; but the terms, it has been thought, would be more judiciouſly confined to the quantity taken, as veins or arteries muſt in all caſes of blood-letting be opened. <hi>In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral bleeding</hi> we commonly take away ſuch a quantity as will in ſome degree decreaſe the power of the ſyſtem—<hi>in local,</hi> ſuch a proportion only as may contribute to relieve a part of the ſyſtem near which the operation is performed—or, we ought to make ſuch diſtinctions, for the ſake of propriety, by which we ſhould underſtand, that in general bleeding, the larger branches of the veins or arteries are opened—in local, only the capillary, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall branches.</p>
               <p>From whence the uſe accruing from this operation is derived may be eaſily conceived—as it proceeds either from leſſening the quantity of blood, altering the ſtate of its motion, or changing its courſe.</p>
               <p>Hence it relieves in all caſes where the maſs of blood abounds too much in quantity; or, when there is a too great tenſion or diſtenſion of veſſels in the ſyſtem, when the force of circulation is highly increaſed, or the heat immoderate, or when in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar blood-veſſels there is a morbid increaſe of action, or the force of the blood is too great againſt parts morbidly affected.</p>
               <p>But where there is too great a ſcarcity of blood, the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remarkably weak or languid, or too great a debility in the voluntary motions—theſe are powerful objections to its uſe.</p>
               <p>Though from this operation it is apparent that the higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages may accrue; and indeed, in many caſes which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory, or ariſe from ſanguinary congeſtion, nothing can be done efficaciouſly without it; ſtill I think it is made infinitely too free uſe of, eſpecially in thoſe places and climates where people are liable to fall into putrid, and ſome malignant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
               <p>Where the patient is ſtrong and athletic the pulſe full and tenſe, and there appear evident ſigns of too great plenitude, it is <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally</hi> right to bleed, otherwiſe there is ſome caution required; for it very often hurries the habit into ſuch a ſtate of extreme debility, in ſome fevers, that nothing can compenſate the miſchief it occaſions.</p>
               <p>In all doubtful caſes, therefore, where it may be thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for blood to be taken away, I would adviſe the operator
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028021_0193_0FD6715482462B28"/>
to lay his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inger on the pulſe of the oppoſite wriſt to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the operation is performed; if, during the ſlowing of the blood, the pulſe riſes, it is an indication to perſiſt; if it ſhould flag, we ſhould immediately deſiſt.</p>
               <p>§ 3. ANTHELMINTICS, worm medicines, from <hi>anti,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and <hi>elmius,</hi> vermis, a worm: or VERMIFUGES.—Thus are called ſuch ſubſtances as deſtroy or expel worms, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſituated in the gullet, in the paſſages to the ſtomach, the ſtomach itſelf, or the inteſtines; but, though it has been ſaid, worms are formed in various parts of the machine, and have been found in different places, as the liver, kidneys, lungs, membrane ſurrounding looſely the heart, brain, cavities of the teeth, &amp;c. we confine ourſelves to medicines which perform their office on thoſe which lodge in the firſt paſſages.</p>

               <p>Indeed, we have had much ſaid on the diſſolving power of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies and quick-lime—ſoap ley taken in broth freed from its ſat—Mrs. Stevens's ſolvent, and lime water—for a long ſeries of time; ſtill few have found the wiſhed for ſucceſs; but how far they may act as preventive remedies, as well as ſome others, cannot be poſſibly determined.

               <p>But it has been alledged, that all alkalies in general poſſeſs this ſtone-diſſolving power, therefore in their cauſtic ſtate they are by ſome rejected; becauſe they are apt to diſagree with the ſtomach, and from thence are they obliged to be employed in too ſmall doſes.</p>
               <p>As ſolvents, I am of opinion, little can be ſaid of the uſe of the claſs here enumerated; but as preventives, having a power to obviate the generation of ſtony concretions in the machine, they may be conſidered to be beneficial in two ways—in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of the ſolids, by preventing a particular ſtate of laxity of the ſtomach, and in the kidney—and in producing ſuch an effect upon the circulating fluids, that they become leſs liable to furniſh ſtony materials to be ſecreted by the kidneys.</p>
               <p>But certain objections will ariſe to the uſe of the <hi>antacids,</hi> if in the ſtomach there ſhould be a diſpoſition prevalent to generate alcaleſcency—to the <hi>aſtringents,</hi> if there ſhould be a rigidity, or contraction in the coats of that organ.</p>
               <p>On <hi>vermifuges</hi> and <hi>lithontriptics</hi> we have been more conciſe than on other parts of our ſubject; becauſe they each are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated here only to the alleviation of ſingle complaints ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under their reſpective heads; of which, when we come to treat hereafter, we ſhall be obliged to ſpeak more fully; and enlarge more on the particular nature of the remedies in each caſe adminiſtered: at preſent it has therefore been thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to furniſh a general idea, in order to prepare our readers properly for more eaſily underſtanding what we have to deliver on theſe heads.</p>

               <p>Before I quit this ſubject, I would beg leave farther to obſerve, that though I have placed the doſes of medicines as uſually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to adults; in all active medicines, I ſhould recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to be given in ſmall doſes at firſt, and gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, till we have arrived at the fulleſt that the conſtitution can bear with eaſe, as the only mode of trying what good effect may be produced by their powers: and here we ſhall often find a ſurpriſing difference in the quantity neceſſary to promote the end deſired—for I have known two grains of a very active me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine produce as powerful an effect on the conſtitution, as eight or ten would on another; and this knowledge can only be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by particular experience. Indeed, I have known complaints cured by the very ſame medicine under the management of one practitioner, that had failed in the hands of another; which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

aroſe from the different modes of management reſpecting the quantity adminiſtered.</p>
               <p>With regard to the forms in which medicines ought to be exhibited, the intent to be anſwered ſhould be particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; whether the <hi>expeditious</hi> or <hi>permanent action</hi> is moſt eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible—if the former, they ſhould be given in liquid—if the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in ſolid forms—becauſe in their diffuſed ſtate they act moſt quickly.</p>

            <p>HAVING finiſhed thoſe parts of our work which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as preparatory to the more complicated, we muſt now enter on an inquiry into the nature of diſeaſes, with the beſt modes of diſcovering and curing them.—But, previous to this, it will be of uſe to ſay ſomething general on the ſubject, in order to ſhew what is meant by diſeaſe—how diſcovered and diſtinguiſhed—the different cauſes—with the indications of cure.</p>
            <p>By DISEASE is meant a general or local affection, by which the ſyſtem is diſturbed, or the action of a part impeded, pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or deſtroyed—or, an appearance deviating from health, from ſome general, partial, or local affection, by which the ſyſtem in general, or in a part, is oppreſſed or disfigured—and this is <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> by an enumeration of certain ſymptoms or appearances with which it is always aſſociated.—But diſeaſes differ; hence it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh them from each other, with which they may ſeem to have a near affinity—this is done by the cauſes and peculiarities that are connected to them; and from whence the deviation ariſes.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of the diſeaſe are threefold:</p>

            <p>But the moſt eligible mode is the PREVENTIVE, acquired by the conſideration of the remote or inducing cauſes, where prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable—and hence preventing prediſpoſition from being render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed active, by intercepting theſe cauſes, or guarding the habit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their influence.</p>

               <p>The ſaliva is ſmall in quantity, clammy;—the mucus of the tongue, gums, and lips is greyiſh, rather yellow, and ſometimes black—the urine in the courſe of the diſeaſe becomes hotter and turbid—there is a moiſture in the ſkin and a ſweat <hi>in the declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fever</hi>—the ſtools are liquid, yellow, often foetid—the mucus of the noſe trifling; and ſometimes from thence haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhages iſſue.</p>

                  <head>§ 1. SIMPLE CONTINUED, OR VASCULO-PLETHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIC, FEVER.</head>
                  <p>Such I would name it, becauſe an increaſed action of the vaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſyſtem, and fullneſs of blood, are the immediate cauſes.</p>
                  <p>This fever is ſometimes of very ſlight duration, terminating in one, at moſt, in three or four days, and ſeldom requiring any medical aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. It makes its attack very often ſuddenly.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſlight coldneſs—the whole body grows red, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the face, attended with ſome turgeſcence, and a vapour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous warmth. The head-ach comes on ſuddenly, the temples throb, the breathing is frequent, the pulſe free, uninterrupted, quick, and full. <hi>In the decline</hi> of the diſeaſe, there appears a breathing ſweat, with no remarkable change in the urine.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. Whatever will ſupernaturally increaſe the action of the veſſels, and induce too great fullneſs of blood in the habit, as errors in diet, too violent exerciſe, cold, ſuppreſſion of ſome natural diſcharge, retention of ſome acrid matters offenſive in the firſt paſſages, from ſome external injury, happening in an health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Medical aid is ſeldom in theſe caſes neceſſary—na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture moſt commonly is the phyſician. Drinking copiouſly of watery liquids warm, ſuch as tea, weak broths, lemonade, ſmall negus; abſtaining from all ſolid food; and lying in bed to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage perſpiration, will be all that is requiſite.</p>
                  <p>Or, if medicine muſt be employed, ſaline mixtures, or nitrous powders, may be had recourſe to. (No. 1, 2.)</p>
                  <p>But ſhould the fever put on more violent appearances—ſhould the pulſe not only be full, but rather hard, with any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of oppreſſion and heat, and the ſkin dry; bleeding, according to the patient's ſtrength, to the quantity of eight, ten,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028021_0202_0FD671A585DF9DC8"/>
or twelve ounces, may be adviſed—and, in caſe of coſtiveneſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> cooling ſaline purgative (No. 3.) may be adminiſtered, to produce three or four evacuations; and in order to appeaſe any hurry which perhaps it may occaſion, a quieting draught in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. (No. 4, 5.)</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe theſe ſhould not ſucceed to our wiſh, and the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms before recited increaſe, the pulſe excepted with reſpect to its fullneſs and hardneſs, theſe being in ſome degree abated; and the patient has paſſed a reſtleſs night; we muſt then fly to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, as the moſt effectual in checking the violence of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The moſt eligible of which are, tartarized antimony, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called tartar emetic, or the antimonial powder of the laſt London Diſpenſatory, a medicine anſwering every purpoſe of Dr. James's Powder. (No. 6 to 9.)</p>
                  <p>The firſt doſe of the mixture, (No. 8.) or the ſecond, if it meets with any foulneſs of the ſtomach, generally excites vomiting, which ſhould be encouraged by copious draughts of chamomile, or weak green tea, or thin gruel—and afterwards the mixture continued.</p>
                  <p>It produces alſo in general a gentle ſweat. One or two eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations by ſtool, quiets the pulſe, takes off the oppreſſion and nauſea; this, by its continuance, and ordering balm tea, barley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, or ſome ſuch diluting liquor, to be drank plentifully, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, in common caſes, every complaint.</p>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding all theſe efforts, ſhould things wear a more unpromiſing aſpect—ſhould the ſickneſs and oppreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; the thirſt, heat, and dryneſs of the ſkin increaſe; head-ach become intolerable; the patient very reſtleſs; the pulſe keep up, or increaſe in fullneſs and hardneſs particularly, more blood muſt be taken away—though, ſhould there be indications of great debility, and the pulſe flag and grow low, it muſt be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—the feet may be put in warm water—and, in continuing the antimonials, great care muſt be taken that they do not operate too violently upwards or downwards, for theſe would aggravate the ſymptoms, or bring on a train of others of more ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                  <p>Under theſe circumſtances, inſtead of the ſaline mixture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcribed, the neutral volatile ſaline (No. 10.) is more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, becauſe this, I think, determines more freely to the ſkin—and, trifling as the alteration may appear, I have ſeen changes obviouſly for the better on its being adminiſtered.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the above caution, if emetics have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the beginning, particularly if there has been any ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or nauſea, they may be given at any period of the diſeaſe, if the ſtrength of the patient will admit.

I ſay poſitively, at the beginning; but ſhould we be called in ſo late, which is often the caſe, that we could not at the beginning give a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the patient for their relief, yet certainly I thought it expedient that it might be done at any time of the fever, if the diſeaſe has not ſo reduced the ſtrength, that its violence cannot be borne—I have, continues he, ordered a vomit without heſitation on the twelfth day of a fever, when all the retchings had ceaſed; nor was it unattended with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to return to our ſubject. If, by the uſe of antimonials, the body ſhould not be kept properly open, glyſters, (No. 25, 26.) ſhould ſupply the defect, adminiſtered in the evening.</p>
                  <p>From this treatment, a continued fever of this kind ſeldom remains longer than the fifth day; but ſhould it purſue its courſe to any later period, it is difficult to determine at what time it will ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Here we muſt be extremely cautious in our prognoſtic, both with reſpect to its duration and danger; for there are often in the conſtitution many latent miſchiefs which do not ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or ſome, which manifeſt themſelves not immediately, may be brought upon the internal and vital parts by the febrile exertions, that when we have a right to expect every favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able concluſion, theſe ſuddenly prevent the operations of nature, and in an inſtant overturn all our flattering proſpects.</p>
                  <p>However, if this fever goes not off on the fifth day, it ſeldom continues longer than the fourteenth—during that ſpace, we are then to endeavour ſo to regulate the moving powers of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, that they may neither act too powerfully nor too weakly—hence are they to be ſupported in a ſtate of moderation—and this we do by thin diet, ſubacid drinks, ſuch as the ſtomach can bear and reliſh; as thin gruels, roaſted apples, oranges, boiled tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, and ſuch like, continuing, under various forms, the uſe of the antimonial ſaline mixture.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the attention we have to pay to the ſyſtem in general, ſometimes the head, ſtomach, and bowels require our notice, in order to alleviate the particular affections under which they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour—for the head now and then is greatly diſordered—bliſters applied between the ſhoulders, bathing and fomenting the ſect with warm water, bring in theſe caſes relief, and diſpoſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to reſt.</p>
                  <p>If ſourneſs ſhould affect the ſtomach and inteſtines, creating pain and flatulence, we ſhould unite with our medicines ſome of the abſorbent earths, as magneſia, chalk, hartſhorn, crabs eyes
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028021_0204_0FD671A58A637C20"/>
or claws prepared, according as the habit is diſpoſed to coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or otherwiſe—under the firſt circumſtance, magneſia—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the laſt, prepared hartſhorn claims the preference.</p>
                  <p>In the manner above recited ſhould we go on as occaſion may require, till nature throws off her oppreſſive load at ſome of her accuſtomed periods, which will be either on the ſeventh, ninth, eleventh, or fourteenth day commonly—or, if the fever is of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger duration, ſeventeenth or twentieth. After this period they are ſeldom obſerved with any accuracy.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe towards the cloſe the ſtrength of the conſtitution appears to be in a debilitated ſtate, the pulſe begins to ſink, and the machine requires ſome ſtimulus, in order to rouſe it to, and preſerve its action—here we muſt have recourſe to ſuch appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as will invigorate the ſyſtem; our former drinks and medicines muſt be altered; we muſt now give wine and water, white wine whey, or pure wine—or, if medicines are prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cordial, camphorated and ſtimulant medicines (No. 13 to 18.)</p>
                  <p>But wine will beſt anſwer the purpoſes we require, as it is conſidered to be the moſt grateful cordial with which we are acquainted.</p>
                  <p>However, if any others are thought more eligible than what we have ſelected, the claſs of ſtimulants will ſupply a ſatisfactory variety.</p>
                  <p>Before we cloſe it will be neceſſary to obſerve, that much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſary in pronouncing the approach of a criſis, or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, or its perfect completion—for it ſometimes begins and recedes.</p>
                  <p>On this occaſion we ſhould take the ſymptoms collectively; and, if they all appear favourable, wait for their continuance; for they will begin on one critical day, and not be complete till the next. If, therefore, the pulſe becomes ſoft and full, and ſubſides daily, ſomething below a healthful ſtandard—the urine depoſits a ſediment to the bottom of the glaſs, or, on ſhaking, it ſubſides—the ſkin becomes ſoft, and a general ſweat ſucceeds—if the patient's ſenſes return after having ſlept, we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to pronounce boldly.</p>
                  <p>After matters are brought to this pleaſing concluſion a doſe or two or phyſic may be exhibited. (No. 19, 20, 21.)</p>
                  <p>The patient ſhould return gradually to his accuſtomed courſe of life, leſt he ſhould, by throwing food into the habit in too large quantities, oppreſs the digeſtive powers, which, with the reſt of the body, muſt be in a ſtate of too great debility to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their functions vigorouſly. His, diet, therefore, ſhould not only be ſmall in quantity, but of the lighteſt ſort; becauſe, from viſcid food, the machine would labour under the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028021_0205_0FD671E6E7AB0B68"/>
as above ſpecified—he ſhould eat often, but ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, take freſh air, and uſe moderate exerciſe, ſuch as his ſtrength will admit, but never purſue it to fatigue himſelf. Under ſuch prudent management, his ſpirits and vigour will return rapidly; and he will every day perceive himſelf making large ſtrides to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his uſual ſtate of health.</p>

                  <head>§ 2. INFLAMMATORY, or VASCULO-SANGUINEOUS INFLAMMATORY FEVER.</head>
                  <p>Becauſe not only the ſame circumſtances occur as in the former fever, with regard to the increaſed action of the vaſcular ſyſtem, and fullneſs of blood—but the veſſels have acquired a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural firmneſs, and the blood too great tenacity, by which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand an in inflammatory diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. The patients at firſt feel as if they were wearied and had been beaten; are apparently weak, and have cold and hot ſits alternating with each other; they tremble, and feel pains all over them, particularly in the ſhoulders, back, knees, and head: to theſe ſucceed an intenſe and burning heat, unextinguiſhable thirſt; their eyes appear inflamed, with a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fullneſs of the face; they are ſick and vomit; are alſo reſtleſs and uneaſy; the pulſe is full and ſtrong; the ſkin dry; the urine for the moſt part high coloured, but ſometimes like water; the tongue rough, dry, brown or black, and furred; blood drawn is very tenacious, and, on ſtanding, covered with a coriaceous ſubſtance like buff-leather; they breathe with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; the body is coſtive; they ſometimes cough; are very watchful and delirious; a ſtupor and drowſineſs come on; at laſt tremblings, twitching of the tendons, hiccough, and an invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary emiſſion of faeces and urine cloſe the fatal ſcene. With regard to the heat, it is of a particular kind, which, though it affects the touch very ſenſibly at firſt, yet ſeems to grow leſs violent the longer we hold the hand upon the ſkin of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                  <p>As to the pulſe, its hardneſs, ſtrength, and fullneſs, are in greater degrees than are to be met with in any other ſpecies of fever.</p>
                  <p>And the urine is not only high coloured, but ſharp, and in ſmall quantities.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. Thoſe which are called <hi>the remote or inducing,</hi> are ſaid to be, perſpiration obſtructed; ſudden cold; too much expoſure to the ſtrong heat of the ſun; fatigue; anger; hard drinking; too long watching; cold water drank whilſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine is hot; or, in ſine, whatever can put the veſſel into too ſtrong and quick action, and for ſome time continue it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="unknown:028021_0206_0FD671A5D2A0A958"/>
The <hi>proximate or immediate,</hi> acrid and tenacious blood ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the very minute, ſerous, and ſanguinary veſſels in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places and increaſed ſtrength and activity of the vaſcular ſyſtem, which the remote cauſes are concluded to confirm, as well as the appearances of blood taken away—the ſymptoms—mode of cure—and the inſpection of dead bodies on diſſection—for in them the viſcera are found in a ſtate of inflammation and mortification.</p>
                  <p>Young people in the vigour of life, ruſtles, ſanguineous habits, free luxurious livers, and all thoſe poſſeſſed of ſtrong ſtamina and tenacity of the circulating fluids, are moſt prone to fall into this fever.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. This fever generally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks thoſe who are formed with ſtrong vigorous ſtamina and denſe blood:—it is conciſely defined, a great increaſe of natural heat, a frequent, ſtrong, hard pulſe, high-coloured urine, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times watery, and the functions of the ſenſorium a little diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>CURE. This is performed by weakening the ſtrength and activity of the vaſcular ſyſtem, leſſening the violence of their action, and thinning the blood.</p>
                  <p>If we were to remove the irritating cauſe ſoon after it had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted its action, there is no doubt but every good conſequence would accrue; but that we cannot do in all caſes, particularly when morbid particles have got ſo blended with the juices, that ſome time is required before they can be properly prepared for being thrown out of the body;—or, after the increaſed action had continued ſo long, that it had by its effects contaminated the fluids; we therefore endeavour to put the frame in ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no violent miſchief ſhall be created by the progreſs of the diſeaſe; and thus give nature an opportunity of exerting her ſalutary efforts with effect, and enable her to throw out the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive materials from the maſs of fluids.</p>
                  <p>For which purpoſe, if called in in the early ſtage, we depend upon bleeding copiouſly, and repeat it agreeable to the patient's ſtrength, until the pulſe is reduced to its proper ſtandard—nor muſt we be deceived by the apparent oppreſſion of the pulſe, for by bleeding it becomes ſtronger—indeed <hi>apparent</hi> weakneſs and loſs of ſtrength proceed ſometimes from too great fullneſs; ſo that the volume of fluids ſeems too powerful for vaſcular action; and unleſs this oppreſſion is taken off, which bleeding moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily accompliſhes, we ſhould run the riſque of their total ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Indeed, ſo neceſſary is this operation at the onſet of theſe fevers, that if it is omitted, the neglect can ſeldom be recovered during the whole courſe.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt proper before the fourth or fifth day, but, under
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028021_0207_0FD671E834D0A910"/>
ſome circumſtances, it may be performed at a later period—in difficult and oppreſſed breathing—violent pain of the head, with high delirium, ſucceeded by drowſineſs, in full and ſtrong habits—for theſe ſymptoms indicate an inflammation of the lungs, or a ſuperabundant load of blood in the brain.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding it <hi>may be right</hi> in any ſtage of the diſeaſe, it is only to be adviſed with extreme caution; for if this operation is carried to exceſs, ſo as greatly to weaken the patient, nature may be diſqualified for throwing off the morbid matter at the time when the criſis ſhould come on; which matter is moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally carried out of the body, either by diſcharges from the inteſtines, kidneys, or the pores of the ſkin.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the neceſſity of repeating the bleeding, we are to be directed by the urgency and continuance of the ſymptoms: therefore after the firſt bleeding in ſix or eight hours, if the pulſe ſhould be nearly or equally as hard and quick as before, and the other febrile ſymptoms ſimilar, it may be repeated, though in ſmaller quantity, and even a third or fourth time, or more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſimilar circumſtances, may be neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>We are next to advert to the ſtate of the ſtomach and bowels:—if there ſhould be any oppreſſion, nauſea, ſickneſs, flatulence, or weight at the pit of the ſtomach, or fullneſs there—ſhould the body be coſtive, we ſhould attempt immediately to clear them of their contents by emetics, (No. 11.) and gentle purgatives. (No. 3. 22 to 24.)</p>
                  <p>But ſhould there be any inflammation of the ſtomach or inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, vomits muſt be by all means avoided, as they might be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the moſt fatal conſequences.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould not any of the above ſymptoms occur, we muſt then endeavour only to take off the ſpaſmodic affections of the ſkin, and promote perſpiration, by creating gentle vomiting or nauſea, by adminiſtering ſlight doſes of antimonials alone, or mixed with ſaline mixture. (No. 6, 7, 8, 9) Warm watery li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids ſhould be drank copiouſly, the legs and thighs fomented with flannels wrung out of warm water, or the ſame liquid thrown in by way of glyſter; for theſe are highly beneficial in thinning the blood, and relaxing the too tenſe fibres. And here we muſt obſerve, that bleeding, where neceſſary, ſhould always be performed before we exhibit a vomit, in order to take off the general fullneſs of the habit, and prevent any congeſtion or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions taking place by its operation in the brain.</p>
                  <p>In caſe of coſtiveneſs, we ſhould add ſmall doſes of tartarized or vitriolated kali, tartarized natron to the antimonials, (No. 6, 7, 8, 9.) caſſia draught, cryſtals of tartar whey, or infuſion of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marinds may be adminiſtered. (No. 22, 23, 24.)</p>

We muſt next endeavour to allay the heat by vegetable acids mixed with ſmall portions of nit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>—apple-water—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of wood ſorrel—currant jelly mixed with water—very weak white wine whey mixed with Seltzer water</hi>—in any of which may be diſſolved ſmall portions of nitre, ſo that four or five grains may be taken at a time; or the aethereal ſpirit of nitre, ten or fifteen drops for a doſe—or, the <hi>Hydromel of Hippocrates,</hi> (ſee page 178.) omitting the mace; for theſe are diluent, aſſiſt in quenching thirſt, preventing the blood from becoming too acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, help to diſſolve its tenacity, conſequently weaken the force of the vaſcular ſyſtem, abate the power of the circulation, take off ſpaſmodic conſtriction, and promote perſpiration;—and theſe liquids may be varied according to the pleaſure of the patient.</p>
                  <p>Abſtinence, as long as the ſtrength will permit, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed; but if that becomes defective, it ſhould be ſupported on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the moſt light liquid food. If ſolids be required, which is ſeldom the caſe, not any thing ſhould be allowed except thin panada—water or barley-gruel—roaſted apple, or boiled turnip. The ſweet aceſcent fruits, <hi>when fully ripe,</hi> may be taken freely for, as they abound with watery particles, are alſo diluting; and as thoſe of the vegetable claſs afford leſs nutrition, conſequently are leſs ſtimulant than ſuch other things as approach nearer to animal nature.</p>
                  <p>So long as the ſymptoms continue ſtrong, we muſt chiefly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the ſaline medicines—antimonials and nitrous powders, (No. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9.) giving the nitre as freely as the ſtomach will bear it, and varying the form as may be judged convenient; for theſe medicines are thought to correct acrimony, take off vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conſtriction, and promote perſpiration.</p>
                  <p>The room in which the patient lies ſhould be ſpacious, and well ventilated with cool freſh air, impregnated with vinegar, the effluvia of freſh flowers, and a free circulation conſtantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; taking care ſo to diſpoſe the patient, that ſtrong cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may be avoided.</p>
                  <p>The bed-cloaths ſhould only, as in health, be moderate, the curtains not cloſe drawn; and, in fine, every thing heating, and which can increaſe the force and quickneſs of the pulſe, muſt be prohibited.</p>
                  <p>The patient ſhould now and then be got up, he will be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſs reſtleſs, preſerve his ſtrength more, and not ſo ſubject to
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028021_0209_0FD671E9B21B83C0"/>
increaſe of head-ach and delirium; for, by ſitting up in an erect poſture, the blood will circulate with leſs force towards the brain, than in an horizontal ſituation; and obſtructions will not be ſo liable to be formed there, nor will the brain be ſo likely to ſuffer depreſſion from a load of fluids.</p>
                  <p>After proper evacuations having been premiſed, ſome adviſe the application of bliſters; becauſe, they diſſolve the viſcid blood, open internal obſtructions, and ſoften the pulſe.</p>
                  <p>Others are of opinion, that they never can be right <hi>though a delirium ſhould come on,</hi> if the pulſe keeps full, hard, and quick; but think the head is better relieved by bathing the feet in warm water, or applying cloths ſqueezed out of it to them, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the thigh juſt above the knee—for the nervous ſyſtem muſt be diſturbed and agitated too freely where the heat conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues great, the ſkin dry, with the pulſe as repreſented—hence bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, while ſuch ſymptoms appear, and the fibres are too tenſe, will increaſe the miſchief, from the additional ſtimulus they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                  <p>In delicate conſtitutions, where there is great proneneſs to nervous incitability, and muſcular irritability rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, bliſters may be uſeful, by regulating the motion of the nervous power, and not being capable of producing any great effect on the muſcular fibres—but, in ſtrong athletic habits, I ſhould think the practice dangerous; but yet, where the pulſe in any conſtitution grows ſoft, and begins to flag, either from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations, or weakneſs of the ſyſtem, brought on in the courſe of the fever, <hi>particularly if attended with drowſineſs, or diſpoſition to conſtant ſlumbering,</hi> towards the height or turn of the lever, at that time they will be found extremely beneficial—by rouſing the nervous ſyſtem, and aſſiſting nature in producing a ſeparation and ejection of the morbid cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Should what we have before adviſed prove ineffectual in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting coſtiveneſs, as more powerful purgatives would be apt to raiſe too great a commotion, and impede nature in her ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary efforts, we muſt have recourſe to glyſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Towards the evening, in almoſt all acute complaints, every ſymptom increaſes much with reſpect to violence, and towards the morning abates; but when the turn of the fever is at hand, the violence continues more uniform throughout, nature appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exert her utmoſt efforts to conquer the diſeaſe, by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the offending matter—hence the agitation of the whole machine is extremely ſevere.</p>
                  <p>If now the ſkin grows ſoft and moiſt, the tongue loſes its dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the urine begins to depoſit a whitiſh ſediment, and becomes leſs high coloured, and ſoon after a more profuſe ſweat breaks

                  <p>From theſe appearances we may conclude a criſis is begun; and in its progreſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But during this conteſt in the critical period, which will be for ſome days from the beginning to its termination, cordials may be thought neceſſary, the beſt of which is wine, given alone or in whey. If medicines to anſwer the purpoſe are thought more agreeable, to what we have delivered from No. 13 to 18, may be added other cordials.</p>
                  <p>But if I find nature in her critical intention points more to the kidneys than to the ſkin I prefer joining the cordials to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of prepared kali and lemon juice, (No. 1.) if to the ſkin, to that of prepared ammonia. (No. 27.)</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes, from all our efforts, we are not even flattered with a favourable iſſue—however we muſt not deſpair—nature often relieves herſelf at the moment we leaſt expect it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, when the conſtitution ſeems drooping, and nature appears almoſt exhauſted, when general tremors come on, twitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the tendons, delirium, and the patient parts with both faeces and urine involuntarily—which appearances are always conſidered to be the reſult of ſtrong nervous affections, giving the diſeaſe the moſt unhappy aſpect—in the deplorable ſtate we depend upon the repetition of bliſters, applied in the following ſucceſſion: 1ſt, to the back—2d, under the arms—3d, above the wriſts—4th, above the knees on the inſide of the thighs—and, 5th, upon the head, if violent pain and much diſturbance there, points out the rectitude of ſuch an application—and likewiſe muſtard poultices, called finapiſms, to the feet, (No. 30.) and give vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſalts—camphor—muſk, (No. 31 to 35.) in order to allay ſome of thoſe convulſive affections which preſent themſelves at this period—for which muſk mixed with valerian is eſteemed highly uſeful.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes in this diſeaſe, at an early period, people will be much afflicted with the head-ach, delirium, watching, or drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, bleeding at the temples with leeches—applying bliſters there—having the head ſhaved and rubbed with vinegar—or portions of the lungs of a lamb applied warm to the head—bliſtering and fomenting the legs, and applying muſtard poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices to the ſoles of the feet, are uſeful auxliaries to the general mode of cure above ſpecified—as is alſo bliſtering the head:—or ſhould they have any pains ſimilar to thoſe of pleuritic people, applying a bliſter over the part affected is beneficial.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes rheumatic affections will be a concomitant—in this caſe, large doſes of nitre will be uſeful—and ſhould any dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teric appearances, ſuch as uneaſy pains in the bowels, propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to go to ſtool, without producing any evacuation; a grain or two or ipecacuanha, given now and then, may act as gentle aperient, ſolicit the diſcharge of the irritating matter, and carry it out of the bowels. To me it obviouſly appears, that theſe applications are only to alleviate the ſymptoms ariſing from the local affection of a part, from a more general cauſe; whilſt, at the ſame time, we muſt perſiſt in the general mode of cure;—why we endeavour at their particular alleviation, is to prevent nature from being diſturbed in her operations by theſe diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or anamalous ſymptoms; as by inattention to them the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger might be increaſed, and the malady prolonged; for theſe ſymptoms, for the moſt part, are ſubdued by time alone, and the fever being kept within proper limits.</p>

                  <head>§ 3. NERVOUS FEVER.</head>
                  <p>This is ſo named becauſe the <hi>nervous ſyſtem</hi> appears to be the part moſt affected. It differs from the inflammatory fever in the part of the conſtitution attacked, and occurs in ſuch as are diſſimilar. Here the nervous ſyſtem is defective, attended with little or no intenſeneſs of vaſcular motion; blood alſo poor and thin, and the nerves extremely incitable. This is alſo called the ſlow fever, becauſe it is ſlow in its progreſs compared with other fevers, paticularly the foregoing.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. This fever makes its attack with dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirits—loſs of appetite—oppreſſion—diſturbed ſleep, or reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs—the patient often ſighs and groans involuntarily—is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently terrified, and affected with uncommon laſſitude after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, tho' that ſhould be ſlight, and at the ſame time has cold and hot ſits ſucceed, and alternate with each other—he is troubled
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028021_0212_0FD671B11EBDBC58"/>
with nauſea, and a vomiting of inſipid phlegm, which come on in a few days after the attack, with giddineſs and pain of the head—extreme proſtration of ſtrength—no remarkable heat—no thirſt—the pulſe is frequent, weak, and ſometimes intermits—the tongue continues moiſt, white and is covered over with a viſcid mucus—there is an oppreſſion at the pit of the ſtomach, and the breathing difficult—the urine is pale, watery, and ſometimes like milk whey—the face red, and fluſhes, at the ſame time that the feet are cold—the mind is ſlightly diſturbed by ridiculous imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which continues, but without any violent delirium ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times immoderate ſweats break out, or colliquative, diſſolving looſeneſs comes on—the ſenſes loſe their quickneſs, and become dull and heavy—with anxiety and fainting attending.</p>
                  <p>Towards the cloſe, when nature appears almoſt worn out by the continuance of the diſeaſe; the tongue trembles—the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities grow cold—the nails livid—they loſe the power of ſight and hearing—the delirium is converted into ſtupor, and a lethargic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition—the faeces and urine paſs away involuntarily—twitching of the tendons comes on—and generally convulſions cloſe the ſcene, in death.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing cauſes</hi> are ſaid to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed fibres, and a weak nervous ſyſtem—too powerful evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—ſalivations from taking mercury too frequently repeated—immoderate venery—mental affliction—watching, and noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtudy—moiſt and ſtagnant air of ſubterraneous jails and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined places; a crude and too thin diet, particularly of cold and watery fruit—watery and viſcid drinks—rainy ſeaſons—a moiſt and loft winter—and, in fine, all thoſe things which by ſlow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees debilitate the nervous ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> great apparent incitability in the nervous ſyſtem—a lentor, and viſcidity of the ſerum, lymph—and thin humours with acrimony from contagion or obſtruction—and a torpor, or defect of intenſeneſs of motion in the vaſcular ſyſtem; which are obvious from the blood taken away—phlegm thrown up from the ſtomach—and appearances agreeing with diſeaſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from corrupted and contaminated ſerum. Hence it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to exert its influence upon the moſt minute, ſerous, lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic, and nervous veſſels; but rather upon the whole brain, as the pale wan colour, paleneſs and dryneſs of ulcers, a deprivation of the ſenſes, extreme debility, and ſuppurations in the brain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſſection, point out.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. In defining this diſeaſe, I ſhould ſay, it was an affection of the nervous ſyſtem, in which there was apparent incitability, with a thickneſs of the ſerum, lymph, and thin humours—a torpor, or defect of intenſeneſs of
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028021_0213_0FD671F376F67328"/>
motion in the vaſcular ſyſtem, independent of nervous incitabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, diſcoverable by ſlight chills—ſhivering—and uncertain fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of heat—ſinking and dejection of ſpirits—frequent involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſighing—general weakneſs—quick irregular pulſe—pale co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured urine—remarkable propenſity to ſpaſmodic affections—no diſtreſſing thirſt—ſometimes retching, though nothing but ſimple phlegm evacuated.</p>
                  <p>CURE. As affections of this kind will ariſe from different kinds of foulneſs in the firſt paſſages, if we are called in early, its progreſs is eaſily prevented, by gentle emetic, (No. 11, 12.) and ſmall doſes of rhubarb, manna, caſtor oil, and ſome ſuch gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aperients, (ſee Emollient, and aſtringent Aperients, under Cathartics, page, 172.)—but if in too advanced a ſtate, when the fever is completely formed, which is almoſt always the caſe, it will purſue its courſe in ſpite of all our endeavours.</p>
                  <p>The indications of cure, are to guard the habit ſo far, that the worſt effects may be prevented; and, as in inflammatory fevers, we endeavour to weaken the ſyſtem, we muſt in this attempt to invigorate the conſtitution, and ſupport it by mild and proper cordial ſtimulants, not given at firſt of too powerful a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding, apt to be applied on ſlight occaſions, is here almoſt always injurious, no diſeaſe bearing that operation ſo badly. At the attack, we ſhould wait for nature pointing out the preciſe diſpoſition of the malady. Sometimes, indeed, in ſome epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic conſtitutions of the air, when at the commencement it attacks habits which are full of blood, putting on the appearance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory affection, a few ounces may be taken away, but not repeated.</p>
                  <p>Where there ſeems to be a determination of blood to the head, diſcovered by pain, heavineſs, and giddineſs there, as ſometimes happens, leeches may be applied to the temples; or cupping at the back part of the head may be had recourſe to; but not on trivial occaſions.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome ſymptoms which ſhew themſelves, ſuch as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and oppreſſed breathing, and are called perip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eumonic; but theſe ariſe not from an inflammatory cauſe; as the breath is nor hot, nor is there any cough, nor different degrees of pain; but the pulſe is ſmall and contracted, and the extremities cold—theſe ſhew the affections to be nervous, not vaſcular;—bleeding would therefore be highly injurious. From their local, as well as general effects, mild emetics are certainly uſeful, from unloading the ſtomach of any viſcid materials, and giving an opportunity for medicines to communicate their effects to the habit and nervous ſyſtem more freely, by having the internal coat of that organ
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:028021_0214_0FD671B303997A70"/>
more openly expoſed to their action—and here ipecacuanha is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to tartarized antimony, as it weakens leſs the influence of the nervous ſyſtem. (No. 38.)</p>
                  <p>The body ſhould be kept open by gentle aperients (172) <hi>only,</hi> as common purges at the onſet have produced ſinking of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, faintings, and other diſtreſſing ſymptoms—or domeſtic glyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, (No. 25.) may be adminiſtered, in caſe of coſtiveneſs, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecond or third day.</p>
                  <p>Bliſters applied through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another, with moderately cordial and diaphoretic medicines, (No. 27 to 29.) and a well-regulated diet, are what muſt be chiefly depended upon; for theſe diſſolve the viſcidity of the ſerum, invigorate the ſyſtem, and render the nerves more uniform and powerful in their action—hence promote inſenſible perſpiration, or a gentle moiſture on the ſurface of the body; but they ſhould not be puſhed ſo far as to induce profuſe ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for a continued ſweat exaſperates the fever.</p>
                  <p>To the diet we ſhould be particularly attentive, in order to ſupport the ſtrength of the patient; for theſe fevers are apt to be of long duration; and this ſhould be of the ſtimulant, cordial, and nutritious kind—of which the ſick ſhould be ſolicited, to take frequently in moderate quantity.</p>
                  <p>White wine whey, thin gruel with wine in it, may be uſed freely, or wine and water—and particularly towards the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, chicken broth, beef-tea, thin jellies of hartſhorn, ſago, and panada with wine. Indeed wine alone may be liberally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, eſpecially if the pulſe grows ſoft upon its uſe, if there ſhould be lowneſs, with a ſoftneſs of the pulſe, and a low drowſy delirium; for under theſe circumſtances it produces ſleep. I have known patients, particularly one lady, take three pints in 24 hours with advantage; but it has been affirmed, ſome quarts have been given in the ſame ſpace of time.</p>
                  <p>All the liquids, if deſired, may be drank cold, as they are only neceſſary to be prohibited in caſes of local inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>There is little doubt but a judicious and well-regulated diet, with the uſe of bliſters, well-timed and well-applied, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a cure—taking care to keep the patient as quiet as poſſible both in body and mind—He ſhould be kept only of a moderate warmth, neither expoſed to too great heat or cold; and his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits exhilirated as much as poſſible, by conſolatory converſation of his medical attendants, and certain promiſes of recovery, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating all gloomy or unpleaſant ideas.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the application of bliſters, ſo great appears to be their uſe, that ſome neceſſary rules ſhould be pointed out.—They 
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:028021_0215_0FD671F4F47BDA20"/>
ſhould certainly, in order to reap the greateſt benefit, be applied at firſt, as ſoon as we know the preciſe nature of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady; but if neglected till the ſyſtem manifeſts high degrees of incitability, diſcoverable from acuteneſs of ſight, touch, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they muſt be omitted till ſome degree of inſenſibility makes its approach—for, <hi>in the firſt inſtance,</hi> they may prevent the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or alleviate the violence of the ſymptoms—<hi>in the ſecond,</hi> they would increaſe them before the period ſtated.</p>
                  <p>As the bliſters are only applied to promote ſtimulus, not any evacuation, becauſe that would tend to debilitate the ſyſtem, and be of diſſervice; therefore, as ſoon as the bliſter is fully raiſed, it ſhould be cut, the aqueous fluid let out, and nothing applied to the part to increaſe the diſcharge. In the firſt inſtance, ſome have adviſed them to be put upon the legs; but, in caſe of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and ſtupor, upon the head, and ſinapiſms to the feet; to which ſhould the laſt give too great pain, they may be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for poultices of milk and bread.</p>
                  <p>In order to relieve the peripneumonic ſymptoms, (217) bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the arms, thighs, or legs are proper, with gentle cordial medicines, (No. 13 to 15.) with the addition of acetated ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, or the cordial ſaline draught, (No. 27.) may be adminiſtered, cordial mixtures, or julep occaſionally, (No. 13, to 15. 28, 29) or ſal volatile, from 20 to 40 drops in muſtard whey.</p>
                  <p>After the continuation of this fever for ten or twelve days, or longer, ſhould a remiſſion come on; that is, ſhould it at times appear to abate much of its violence, and then come on again—or ſhould ſweats too much exhauſt the patient, Peruvian bark, adminiſtered with cordials, is highly proper, in ſuch forms as the ſtomach will beſt bear, either infuſed in wine, in decoction, or infuſed only in hot or cold water, (No. 39 to 49.)—though the firſt form is eſteemed the beſt, ſometimes it is more agreeable to the ſtomach in ſome other mode.</p>
                  <p>In the declenſion of this fever, where the remiſſion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion was very diſtinct, Huxham gave the bark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctively with the ſaline draught, and found it more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>Bark alſo tends to prevent or check mortifications, which ſometimes come on from preſſure by long lying, bliſters, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napiſms.</p>
                  <p>In caſes of tremblings, twitching of the tendons, and convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, muſk, in doſes, according to the violence of the ſymptoms, and mixing it with valerian, as adding to its efficacy, (No. 31 to 35.) are beneficial.</p>
                  <p>In caſes of looſeneſs during the courſe of the complaint, if moderate, they may not be dangerous; ſtill if profuſe, they
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028021_0216_0FD671B70FCF5D00"/>
ſhould be checked, though not entirely ſtopped—they may be moderated by ſlight doſes of rhubarb and opiates, or abſorbent or ſtringent juleps. (No. 42, 43) The white decoction and red wine will be a proper drink.</p>
                  <p>Or, we may endeavour to promote gentle ſweat, in order to divert the fluids to the ſkin, by mild opiates, as camphorated tincture of opium, from twenty to forty drops, or the opiated confection, from one ſcruple to half a dram to a doſe, may be added to any of the cordial mixtures, (No. 13 to 15. 28, 29.) and given as directed in the abſorbent juleps.</p>
                  <p>And, laſtly, if aphthae, or thruſh, ſhould come on, attended with ulcerations of the throat, here detergent gargles are uſeful, (No. 44 to 47.) and gentle emetics, (No. 11, 12, 38.) But if ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is nearly obſtructed by a quantity of viſcid phlegm, ſtronger may be adminiſtered, which will be formed by increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doſe of ipecacuanha, or tartarized antimony in each.</p>
                  <p>Though, ſhould a ſalivation come on without aphthae, and that pretty freely, Dr. HUXHAM conſiders it, as it really is, a favourable ſign—for, ſays he, <q>when this happens, with a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moiſture of the ſkin, I never deſpair of my patient, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever weak or ſtupid he may ſeem.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As there ſeems to be ſo much danger in this fever, from the very beginning to the termination, it may afford ſome benefit to be acquainted with thoſe ſymptoms which may give us flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes; and to know thoſe from whoſe appearance we may be enabled to prepare ourſelves for the fatal cataſtrophe.</p>
                  <p>If the delirium ſhould be ſlight, no great debility—if the pulſe ſhould, upon the adminiſtration of cordials, become more full; and about the termination of the diſeaſe, a gentle ſweat or looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but particularly a ſalivation without aphthae, come on—if any tumors appear about the ears—and a miliary eruption ſhews itſelf, without any profuſe ſweat having preceded, we may have reaſon to expect <hi>a favourable concluſion</hi>—but if a ſtrong delirium ſhould continue above four days—if there ſhould be copious eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations—a profuſe unſeaſonable ſweat from the cheſt, head, and neck—the feet and legs only more dry and cold—twitching of the tendons—trembling of the hands and tongue—a colliquative or diſſolving looſeneſs—with a weak pulſe—loſs of light—and impeded deglutition, accompanied with an hiccough—ſhould the hands grow cold—the ſauces livid—blood flow from the veſſels—and ſpots like flea-bites appear—there can remain little hope of eſcaping the moſt fatal conſequences.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to a deafneſs coming on, it has been conſidered by ſome as a favourable omen, by others the reverſe; at beſt it is but of dubious import, and not to be depended upon; for from
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:028021_0217_0FD671F68BD4FDE0"/>
experience I can ſpeak, that I have ſeen it an attendant ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom on both death and a recovery.</p>

                  <p>Which term I think applicable, becauſe the maſs of blood appears to be materially and principally concerned in this fever—for in thoſe of which we have before treated, the chief diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance has been created primarily in the vaſcular and nervous ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>But it may be aſked, how comes it that this fever ſometimes begins its attack with ſtrong ſymptoms of an inflammatory, at others of a nervous, fever? This variation happens moſt likely in its different degrees, adequate to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>For if putrid matter was to be generated in, or abſorbed into the habit, whoſe blood was of a firm texture, and vaſcular ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem had proper tenſion, it would be longer before indications of abſolute putridity having taken place in that conſtitution would preſent themſelves, than if the nervous ſyſtem had been in a ſtate of relaxation, and the blood thin and poor. There can be little doubt of this fact—and that this deviation is owing entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the nature of one conſtitution being able to reſiſt the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the putrid cauſe longer than the other. And, indeed, if we conſider that thoſe whom experience has pointed out to us moſt ſubject to this diſeaſe are, the infirm; ſuch as labour ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and live in a ſtate of poverty; the luxurious and indolent; the penſive and melancholic; thoſe who ſit up late; thoſe of cold phlegmatic conſtitutions; we ſhall need little other confirmation of our aſſertion.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe which are fixed to be the <hi>proximate or immediate cauſes</hi> are, a putrid diſſolution of the humours, particularly of the red particles, as we have a right to conclude from the effect of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid ferments diſſolving and breaking down the texture and tenacity of ſolid and fluid ſubſtances wherein it takes place.</p>

                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. In order to diſtinguiſh the putrid fever in its earlieſt attack, or very ſoon after, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the degrees of <hi>debility, oppreſſion, and nauſea are more conſiderable</hi> than in any other fever: the <hi>poſtration of ſtrength ſudden and violent</hi> has for its aſſociates <hi>extreme deſpondency,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility,</hi> and <hi>want of apprehenſion</hi> to an uncommon degree, which beſpeaks great danger.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>loſs of appetite,</hi> or <hi>loathing of food, ſickneſs, languor,</hi> and <hi>dull pain, of the head,</hi> ſimilar to what happens in the two former fevers before deſcribed, which attend, when it comes on, as it ſometimes does gradually, <hi>are in the beginning always more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and ſudden than in the inflammatory, though ſeldom ſo much ſo as in the nervous fever.</hi> Beſides, the ſmallneſs of the pulſe, the dejection of ſpirits, the broken texture of the blood, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpots, and putrid ſtate of the excrements, diſtinguiſh it <hi>from the inflammatory fever.</hi> The degree of heat, the very high-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured urine, the thirſt, the ſpots, and putreſcency, <hi>from the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fever:</hi> And its formation is rendered perceptible by cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſhivering, which has for its aſſociates nauſea, vomiting, giddineſs, confuſion of the head, extreme and ſudden proſtration of ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>CURE; The indications of which are, to endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſtrength, counteract the putreſcent acrimony, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the action of the nervous ſyſtem, by giving ſtrength and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to the debilitated fibres, correcting the putrid ſtate of the fluids, and promoting the diſcharge of morbid matter.</p>
                  <p>And under ſome circumſtances, bleeding in this fever at the beginning has been adviſed, where it has attacked robuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions full of blood, and here, perhaps, once it may be right; but not without the ſymptoms run to an alarming height, would I adviſe the operation; and then only in order to prevent the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal effects which might be induced by the violence of ſome of them: for, though the pulſe ſhould be at firſt full and ſtrong, on taking away blood it ſoon ſinks, and ſometimes ſo much, that we labour in vain afterwards to get it raiſed. Without, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we have evident ſigns of an inflammatory ſtate of the blood, and that the brain, lungs, or ſome other of the vital parts are threatened with inflammation, we ſhould never bleed—and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the above circumſtances, then <hi>only in the beginning</hi> ſhould a few ounces be taken away, merely as an alleviator of a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſymptom.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the firſt paſſages are to be cleared from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents by gentle emetics, (No. 11.) giving ſmall doſes of antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:028021_0220_0FD671BD9F9017E8"/>
and theſe repeated every ſecond hour, (No. 6 to 9.) For wherever the ſymptoms, which ſeem to indicate the uſe of the lancet, are violently urgent, <hi>they alone</hi> are the ſafeſt applications. But we ſhould be careful not to occaſion profuſe diſcharges, which may produce too great lowneſs. If the antimonials cauſe not too or three ſtools, a gentle aperient may be given, (No. 22 to 24—49 to 51.) or glyſters, (No. 25, 26.) which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated every third day.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being premiſed, our chief d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

(Page 193.)—the antiſeptic whey, (No. 48.)—fermented, or mineral acids, (Page 194.)—camphor, (Page 149.) (No. 15. 54.)—and bark, (No. 39 to 41. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Page 194.) particularly, which has been known to produce a ſtoniſhing effects in a highly-diſſolving ſtate of the blood, where haemorrhages have from that cauſe been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. With theſe medicines we ſhould begin, as ſoon as ever we perceive the diſſolution of the blood has taken place, from the appearance of purple ſpots or haemorrhages; not waiting as in other malignant fevers, for any remiſſion; for it is on bark, camphor, and wine we muſt chiefly depend for ſucceſs in theſe caſes, coupled in ſome of haemorrhages with aſtringents; to which we ſhall ſoon advert.</p>
                  <p>I would not adviſe, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in the caſes of nervous fever, the uſe of ſtimulants in conjunction with bark, (No. 40, 41.) but where the nervous ſyſtem appears to be extremely torpid; then, I think they give great power to that, and render it more active; for I am fully perſuaded, that it produces its good effects, by giving firmneſs to the ſolids, equability of action to the moving pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, preventing the effects of putrid diſſolution, and enabling them to ſeparate and throw off the morbid materials, rather than correcting the acrimony, or preſerving the texture of the blood by any other means. And this ſeems in a great degree to be corroborated by the opinion of HUXHAM, when ſpeaking of theſe fevers, whoſe practice in theſe complaints was very conſiderable, ſays, <q>Though nature very frequently affects to diſcharge the morbific matter in putrid malignant fevers by vomits and ſtools, yet her more conſtant efforts are through the pores of the ſkin;—and I ſolemly aſſert, I never ſaw theſe fevers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely carried off till more or leſs of a ſweat enſued; if it proves moderately warm, and equally diffuſed over the whole body; if it comes on about the ſtate of the diſeaſe, and the pulſe grows open, ſoft and calm a little before, and during its
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028021_0221_0FD671FA31821668"/>
continuance; but if very profuſe, cold, clammy, or partial about the head or breaſt only, we have much more reaſon to fear than to hope from it. If profuſe ſweats break out in the beginning, they are generally pernicious, ſhould a fever ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under the circumſtances recited above, though bliſters are ſaid not to be uſeful in the beginning, becauſe the nervous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſhews no ſigns of torpor; yet are they often ſucceeded with happy effects, when people become ſtupid, drowſy, and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and, indeed, at any time, if the pulſe is very low, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and excrement paſs off involuntarily, which I have obſerved in an early ſtage.</p>
                  <p>Wine, as it is an univerſal cordial, ſo it is the beſt, which may be given liberally; amongſt the moſt eligible of which are cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, red port, and old rh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>niſh; or, where they cannot be had, from their dearneſs, ale or porter may be uſed. As for <hi>food,</hi> gruel, panada, ſharpened with orange or lemon juice, roaſted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, fruit of all kinds—for <hi>drink,</hi> the wines above mentioned mixed with water, lemonade, orangeade, wine wheys of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſorts, apple water mixed with wine, vinegar whey, old ſound cyder, and all thoſe liquids of an aceſcent nature, or which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect putreſcency, ſhould be indulged in.</p>
                  <p>The room in which the ſick is confined ſhould be well ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated, vinegar ſprinkled on the beds, and round the room, freſh flowers and aromatic herbs ſtrewed about; the patient ſhould have clean linen often renewed, and the ſtools be removed as early as poſſible, whether they paſs voluntarily or otherwiſe; for nothing refreſhes the ſick more than cool air and cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>By the means here generally deſcribed we ſhall commonly ſo aſſiſt and invigorate the conſtitution, as to enable it to throw off the more morbid matter, which is done by various ways, but moſt frequently by ſweat, to aſſiſt in which operation, CAMPHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATED VINEGAR is ſtrongly recommended, (No. 55.) but, if joined with an opiate, HUXHAM ſays, it is the moſt certain ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific in nature—the ſolution though, by itſelf, promotes perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gentle ſweat more certainly than any other medicine; beſides where mild ſtimulants are neceſſary, it heats leſs than volatiles, or ardent ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Nature ſometimes contrives the mode of expulſion for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid matter by the bowels, hence a diarrhoea, which, if attended with breathing ſweats, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

matter in different glands, (Page 25.) ſuch as thoſe under the ear, the arm-pits, or groin; or, by throwing down highly acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and corroſive humours into the legs, about the hips, or moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the lower part of the back, aſſiſted in this effort by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lying—hence is mortification of the integuments induced, forming thick ſloughs, which have deep, ſpreading ulcers, from a ſupply of a corroſive fluid called ichor. Here we muſt rely chiefly on Peruvian bark, to produce, by its invigorating power, a ſeparation of the parts mortified.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes, whilſt we are exerting ourſelves to promote every good purpoſe, by a plan judiciouſly conceived, and well ſelected applications, ſome accidental occurrences will ariſe in different parts, which, if neglected, or judiciouſly managed, will fruſtrate our intent, and every effort of nature. Whatever, therefore, threatens to fink the patient, or diſturb nature's general operations, muſt be, if poſſible, checked, or totally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
                  <p>Should a <hi>haemorrhage,</hi> as ſometimes happens, come on, vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olic acid may be added to the bark decoction. (No. 53.) or it may be given with any other vehicle, or the common drink may be acidulated with it, and given pretty freely. Should not theſe ſucceed, alum, or alum-whey may be added, (Page 189.) or given in powder. (No. 56.)</p>
                  <p>Should a <hi>profuſe diarrhoea</hi> make its appearance, and give us leave to ſuppoſe that the conſtitution by this means would be enfeebled, it muſt be reſtrained only gradually; for if we look up the matter ſuddenly, without ſupplying ſome other more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mode of paſſage out of the machine for the corruped fluid, internal miſchief might be occaſioned in the inteſtines, by the irritation it would there produce.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore endeavour to determine the fluids to the ſkin, by ſome well-adapted diaphoretics, (No. 57, 58.) and, at the ſame time, ſhould the ſtools continue copious, and extremely foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid, glyſters of fixable air, with which ſome mild watery antipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcent liquid is impregnated, or fixable air may be thrown up alone, for this is a powerful corrector of putreſcent acrimony, and would take off the ſtimulus of thoſe veſſels which pour out their contents into the bowels, called exhalent, and render the medicines given more effectual in puſhing forwards, or ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the humours to the ſkin.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes there will occur <hi>violent vomiting,</hi> which in this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not unuſual.</p>
                  <p>This ought to be reſtrained, and generally our ſucceſs in the attempt will be pretty certain, by giving the ſaline draught in a ſtate of fermentation. (No. 59.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="unknown:028021_0223_0FD671C208274F90"/>
By the means of this the offenſive and foul matters in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and flexure of the duodenum, (42.) are ſuppoſed to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and thus, by removing part of the fomes, (that is, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which created the uneaſy ſenſations of the ſtomach, and was a means of ſupporting the febrile affections) of conſequence leſſen the nauſea, and other ſymptoms indicative of its preſence, as well as, in all probability, ſhorten the duration of the fever.</p>
                  <p>Another peculiar accident may happen, though perhaps very rarely, which we ought by all means to be guarded againſt. Bark, upon which we in this fever place ſuch dependence, will not agree with all conſtitutions, decoction of pomegranate bark, and chamomile flowers, may ſupply its place, and is ſaid to anſwer every purpoſe, (No. 60.)</p>
                  <p>Though it may be ſometimes the caſe that bark will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with our patients in the common modes of adminiſtration, ſtill I have never found but in ſome of its forms it may be made to anſwer every purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>By beginning with the cold infuſion, and gradually increaſing its power, I have been enabled to adminiſter it in all its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated forms, and produced its deſired effects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eruptions of different colours,</hi> red, purple, black, dun, or green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſh, called petechiae, ſtrike out ſometimes toward the cloſe, or earlier, of different ſizes; but theſe ſeldom bring any relief from oppreſſion, ſickneſs, or other diſtreſſing ſymptoms—the redder they are the better—and it is a favourable ſign where thoſe which are of a black or violet colour become of a brighter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; for theſe coloured ſpots beſpeak a high degree of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent acrimony, and activity, bringing on a dangerous ſtate of ſanguinary diſſolution—ſo the change of colour to that which is moſt favourable, ſhews the degree of miſchief leſſening, and their cauſes growing weaker.</p>
                  <p>About the eleventh or fourteenth day, <hi>miliary eruptions</hi> with a white appearance break forth; ſometimes ſucceeding profuſe ſweats, which not unfreque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tly happen at this time. Theſe ſeldom relieve; but if there appears a red, ſmarting, itching raſh, or large, fretting watery bladders, they are ſerviceable. But we may have hopes of recovery from the breaking out of a ſcabby eruption about the noſe, lips, and corners of the mouth—the more angry and hot it is, the more favourable the omen. To theſe we may add, if the ſymptoms are mild—if a looſeneſs or foetid ſweat ſhould break out at the decline of the diſeaſe, there is conſiderably leſs danger, than where there is no thirſt—the ſauces inflamed—a large crop of black eruptions, which ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recede—a laborious reſpiration after their eruption—a ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the belly with looſeneſs—foetid and ichorous ſtools—cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028021_0224_0FD671C208274F90"/>
of the extremities—and convulſions—for theſe afford moſt calamitous portents.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, with regard to the aphthae or thruſh, of whatever co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they carry along with them no pleaſing omen, when they break out on the inſide of the mouth—for they are ſoon ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by putrid ulcerations of the throat, &amp;c. bringing along with them difficulty of ſwallowing, and hiccough, in the firſt inſtance—afterwards, foetid, bloody, and dyſenteric evacuations, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from ulceration and mortification of the inteſtines.</p>
                  <p>But when patients have fortunately paſſed the ſtage of fatality, they often become dropſical, or have watery ſwellings in their legs, we muſt not, under theſe circumſtances, depend on purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to evacuate the watery-fluid, as in other dropſies—but bark, (Page 194.) ſteel, and the natural chalybeate waters. (Page 139.) to ſtrengthen and invigorate the vaſcular ſyſtem, and promote abſorption. (No. 61, 62.)</p>
                  <p>But, in order to prevent a relapſe when the criſis is perfected, from putreſcent or offenſive matters accumulating in the firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, a gentle purgative of two, (No; 3. 19, 20, 21.) is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite—and a courſe of aromatic bitters, joined with chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beates. (No. 63, 64, 65.) or ſome of the chalybeate waters, (Page 139.) with light, nutritious, eaſily digeſtible food. (Page 209.)</p>
                  <p>And here we muſt obſerve, that where we find any prevailing acid upon the ſtomach, we would adviſe ſteel to be given in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance—where not, ſome of the chalybeate ſalts, of which the tartarized iron, (Page 139.) is ſuppoſed by ſome to be the beſt, and may be given inſtead of vitriolated iron—and it is ſaid to have proved efficacious where all the others have failed; and it more ſoluble in the animal fluids.</p>
                  <p>The medicines above preſcribed, or ſome others of the ſame kind, are thought neceſſary, in order to recover the tone of the viſcera, and enable the digeſtive powers to aſſume their wonted power—which being neglected, a foundation may be laid for chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic complaints, by the conſtitution's being loaded with acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and ill-conditioned humours, and ſubjecting the patient to jaundice, dropſies, conſumptions, or ſome ſuch ſimilar miſchief.</p>
                  <p>We have now finiſhed our account of ſimple fevers: and as we conſider all the others, whatever their appellation, to belong to one of the foregoing, ſimply, or conjointly, we ſhall be under the neceſſity of having recourſe to ſome of the modes of cure, here ſpecified, in all; and have therefore choſen here to add the forms of medicines made uſe of in theſe fevers, referring in the body of the work occaſionally to the more general catalogue, that

                  <head>§ 5. MIXED FEVERS.</head>
                  <p>On treating on the different kinds of ſimple fevers, in the four former ſections, we found, that according to their differences, we could diſcover which part of the ſyſtem was in them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly affected, and conſtituted the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="unknown:028021_0237_0FD6721419DB6E38"/>
In the <hi>ſimple continued,</hi> the vaſcular ſyſtem, with reſpect only to its motions being quickened.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>the inflammatory,</hi> beſides the increaſe of motion, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive tenacity in the blood, and the ſtrength and activity of the veſſels augmented beyond what is natural.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>ſlow nervous,</hi> the nerves ſeem to be primarily and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, without any increaſe of vaſcular action, but rather a degree of torpor, and defect in their natural motion, with a lentor, or viſcidity of the ſerum, lymph, and thin humours.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>putrid,</hi> this nervous affection was accompanied at firſt, or ſoon after, with a putreſcency of the fluids.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe peculiarities produce particular ſymptoms, which enable us to diſcover their nature. But the claſs of fevers rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under this head have ſome of the immediate cauſes of theſe ſimple fevers ſo blended together, as the <hi>inflammatory and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> the <hi>malignant and nervous,</hi> the <hi>nervous and inflammatory</hi>—or ſo inſtantaneouſly and imperceptibly follow each other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the indications to be deduced from the ſymptoms, that we are at a loſs where to refer them—as the diſtinguiſhing ſigns of the two different kinds will preſent themſelves at the ſame time; for in ſome we find great nauſea and extreme debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity—great heat, with a quick, ſtrong, and hard pulſe—here are the characteriſtic ſymptoms of the inflammatory and putrid unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and form truly the MIXED FEVER. We will, however, now endeavour to explain how theſe ariſe.</p>
                  <p>When ſpeaking of the brain, (Page 26, 27.) it was there ſaid, that vaſcular irritability might be independent of nervous influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though, for the continuance of that irritability, nervous influence is abſolutely neceſſary. We muſt now farther obſerve, that vaſcular irritation always requires local ſtimulus for its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and that the veſſels may be affected without any ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of the nerves—and ſo on the contrary—and alſo that they may be conjointly affected from the ſame cauſe.</p>
                  <p>We likewiſe farther affirm, that morbid particles creating diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe produce different effects, from their elective power upon the ſolids as well as fluids—hence from this ſource ariſes the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent natures of ſpecific fevers—and hence it is from the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent combinations of the cauſes that the mixed fevers deduce their origin.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to be an extremely difficult taſk to draw our ideas of theſe fevers into a ſmall compaſs; or ſo to ſimplify them, that all which occur can be brought within the bounds of a conciſe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; for every cauſe which can produce any of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing febrile complaints; every part which can alſo be affected in them, may conjunctively appear ſo in theſe; and in ſuch very
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:028021_0238_0FD671D128CD5000"/>
different degrees, that we are puzzled to diſcriminate to which they can properly belong.</p>
                  <p>I can by no means agree with the idea of Dr. CULLEN, that the account he has given of the fever he terms SYNOCHUS, which obviouſly is his mixed fever, is at all adequate to comprehend the whole of thoſe fevers, which come certainly under this term—for he ſays, <q>it is a contagious fever for the moſt part, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the inflammatory fever at the beginning, in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and towards its termination, running into a nervous or putrid fever,</q>—which he names typhus—In all which there is no practical utility; for it may be only an inflammatory fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſimply, thus terminating; which often happens to be the caſe—induced frequently by the violence of the diſeaſe, ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental circumſtances, or miſmanagement. The continued, or vaſculo-plethoric fever, which is ſimple, may, from the ſame cauſes, have the ſame termination.</p>
                  <p>Though we will not ſay that fevers of the above deſcription may not ſometimes occur ſtill we think that the complicated affections may always be in a great degree obſerved, and ſhould be particularly pointed out.</p>
                  <p>From what has been advanced on this ſubject, the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of forming a definition to comprehend the whole of theſe fevers which may often meet our obſervation, is ſufficiently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
                  <p>However, in defining theſe fevers in general, I ſhould ſay, that the ANOMALOUS, OR MIXED FEVERS, were an affection of the nervous and vaſcular ſyſtem, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conjoined with that of the maſs of circulating fluids, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing febrile appearances; but, from the beginning, very often ſo indiſtinctly marked, having the inflammatory, nervous, and putrid ſymptoms ſo blended, that it is difficult to ſay to what kind they moſt peculiarly belong; and if we add to this Dr. CULLEN'S opinion, (Page 241.) the idea of mixed fevers will be tolerably complete;—and as we have given the whole of the ſymptoms ſeparately under each of our former diviſions, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſome of them here in a conjunctive ſtate; and marking thoſe which are moſt prevalent; we ſhall be enabled to point out what is neceſſary to be done—to alleviate that ſpecies which is the moſt powerful in its action, conſequently the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and not altogether neglect the other—but this to execute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly requires profound medical knowledge, quick perception, nice diſcrimination, and experienced ſagacity.</p>

SYDENHAM, to whom I ſhall refer my reader, has given us ſome hiſtories of theſe kinds of fevers, under different names, either according to SOME PREVALENT SYMPTOM—as <hi>the ſudato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſweating, the comatous or drowſy</hi>—or to THE INTENT OF NATURE, as the <hi>depuratory, or cleanſing</hi>—the IMITATIVE, as the <hi>variolous fever,</hi> or <hi>that ſimilar to the ſmall pox fever</hi>—or to THE SEASON, as <hi>the hyemal, or wintery.</hi> We ſhall content ourſelves with preſenting, as a ſpecimen, The PUERPERAL, or CHILD-BED FEVER, one of the moſt dangerous and fatal with which medicine is at preſent acquainted.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. This fever generally begins on the firſt, ſecond, or third day, ſometimes later, after delivery, with cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſhivering preceding any <hi>pains of the belly,</hi> which are <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> and <hi>has a ſoreneſs attending over the whole region below the ſtomach, ſcarce capable of hearing the gentleſt touch</hi>—the belly is ſometimes ſoft—ſometimes greatly ſwelled. The pains, though general, will affect ſome one part more particularly than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhoot from the loins to the groins and thighs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times affect the anus and neck of the bladder.</p>
                  <p>The pulſe is quick and weak, though now and then, eſpecially a little after the attack, ſtrong and full—the ſkin is, for the moſt part, hot and dry, though ſometimes cool and temperate; and, not unfrequently, intermediate ſweats come on all over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and uſually afford ſome alleviation—there is a conſtant pain of the head, chiefly the forehead, and above the eyebrows, attended often with a giddineſs and reſtleſſneſs.</p>
                  <p>The tongue has very different appearances, commonly white, ſoft, and moiſt, and will thus continue till near death—then it becomes dry, rough, and of a yellowiſh brown colour—a red line will ſometimes run up its middle, with a whiteneſs on each ſide; the firſt is dry, the laſt moiſt—along with theſe there is alſo a great thirſt.</p>
                  <p>The face is often fluſhed, ſometimes of a deep red, or livid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour fixed in the cheeks. There appears in the countenance and eyes ſtrong marks of anxiety and dejection of ſpirits. <hi>From the very beginning of this diſtemper, the patients ſeem afraid of taking a ful inſpiration, hence is the breathing quick and ſhort, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to proceed from any affection of the lungs very often; and as the diſeaſe increaſes, ſo doe, the ſhortneſs of breathing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is moſt commonly a cough as a concomitant;—load of the ſtomach—nauſea—and vomiting of yellow, greeniſh, or black materials, frequently attend; but not invariably, though they
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:028021_0240_0FD671D4C4DD77D8"/>
ſometimes come on from the time of delivery, nay, now and then indeed precede it;—and, at the approach of death, what is vomited up is either green or black.</p>
                  <p>If blood ſhould be taken away, it is in general ſizy, with a quantity of yellow ſerum. The pain of the head, though very troubleſome, is ſeldom attended, till a few hours before death, with delirium.</p>
                  <p>The urine at firſt is made with difficulty, and ſmall in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, though removed by two or three ſtools; and, as the diſeaſe abates, it is declared by a depoſition of the colour of brick duſt, or whitiſh ſediment.</p>
                  <p>At the commencement the habit is, for the moſt part, coſtive—ſometimes regular—at others looſe, diſcharging very foetid and brown coloured faeces—and in both ſtates <hi>flatulence attends</hi>—and the general omens of approaching diſſolution are, involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily evacuations from the bowels.</p>
                  <p>In high degrees of this diſeaſe, the patient, for the moſt part, lies on her back, ſeldom turns on either ſide, and never on her belly.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the general ſymptoms, by which the fever may be diſcovered, and which appear when the uterus is not affected—but if we perceive any of the ſymptoms which are declaratory of uterine inflammation, we may ſuſpect the affection of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a participating cauſe.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. Thoſe which are conſidered <hi>as the remote or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing,</hi> are,</p>
                  <p>Intemperance <hi>during pregnancy</hi>—too great fatigue, or total want of exerciſe—too high or too low living—coſtiveneſs, or the reverſe—exceſs of joy or grief—moiſt and warm atmoſphere, impregnated with putrid effluvia. <hi>In lying in,</hi> an overheated air—too warm a regimen—ſudden frights—coſtiveneſs after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very—and every accident which can obſtruct perſpiration—vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and too great haſte in ſeparating the placenta—and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the trunk of the body with too tight bandages.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which are ſaid to be the <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> are,</p>
                  <p>Impeded circulation, or ſtagnation of the blood, generally in the veſſels of the omentum, (37.) and inteſtines, chiefly the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal coat of the ſmall ones, (42.) ſometimes of the womb, (51.) inducing in thoſe parts inflammation, from the debilitated ſtate of the vaſcular ſyſtem there ſituated, brought on by the preſſure of the pregnant womb; if cauſes (243.) occur which are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of producing febrile affections in the habit—which affections are firſt moſt commonly of the inflammatory; afterwards, if the fever in this ſtate is not cured, of the putreſcent kind.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Common febrile ſymptoms,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:028021_0241_0FD67217E15785C0"/>
attended with violent acute pains of the belly below the ſtomach, with ſoreneſs of the parts ſo great as ſcarce to bear the gentleſt touch—dread in taking a full inſpiration—breathing quick and ſhort, nor appearing to proceed from affections of the lungs—and increaſing with the diſeaſe—and in coſtiveneſs, or the reverſe, flatulence.</p>
                  <p>CURE. The indications are to take off in the firſt inſtance, the inflammation, and prevent the humours from running into a ſtate of putreſcent acrimony—both which are effected by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if neceſſary, at the onſet—purging—promoting the urinary diſcharge—or ſweating—for in ſome of theſe ways this fever ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally goes off, or is conquered, particularly by purging. If the termination is favourable, it occurs in three, four, or five days; if otherwiſe, from the fifth to the twelfth.</p>
                  <p>Hence, therefore, from what has been above delivered, our medical conduct is plainly pointed out.</p>
                  <p>If, at an early period of the diſeaſe, the habit is found abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with blood, the febrile heat great, and the pulſe full and ſtrong, blood muſt be immediately drawn from the arm; and, ſhould the body be coſtive, an emollient aperient glyſter, (No. 25, 26.) ſhould be, as ſoon as poſſible, adminiſtered; but ſhould not this relieve by producing evacuation, ſome mild or emollient aperient medicine (Page 171, 172.) muſt be given, till a free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the bowels is procured—for ſtools muſt at all events be had; on theſe, at firſt, are founded our greateſt hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; as by emptying the firſt paſſages, all diſtenſion from the contained faeces is taken off—flatulence leſſened—irritation from the faeces avoided—and ſome degree of freedom given to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating powers of the parts affected.</p>
                  <p>But this ſhould be done by the gentleſt means—by ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as will not create ſickneſs, as the cooling ſaline purge, (No. 3, 23, 24.) or oil of caſtor emulſion. (No. 66.)</p>
                  <p>Tartarized antimony, (No. 6, 7.) or antimonial wine in ſmall doſes, (Page 180.) are recommended to be given with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent every ſecond or third hour; but in their purgative effects, they are too uncertain—I therefore mix ſmall portions of them with other purgatives, which I think quicken, their effects. (No. 3, 22 to 24.) or the antimonial aperient mixture. No. 67.)</p>
                  <p>The firſt evacuations are generally foetid; but if they become afterwards leſs offenſive, and the patient feels herſelf generally relieved, the moſt commonly falls into a ſleep, and a gentle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration ſucceed; which muſt be encouraged by ſuch medicine, as cool at the ſame time that they contribute to promote this purpoſe, ſuch as tartarized antimony, antimonial powder, No. 6. 7, 8, 9.) and wine, (Page 180.) ipecacuanha, (No. 57.) nitre, (No. 2,) ſaline mixture, (No. 1.) to which may be added ſome ſlight
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:028021_0242_0FD671D52B40A5A8"/>
opiate, (Page 152.)—for theſe alleviate pain—determine the fluids externally—and prevent their effects from internal diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, irritation, or acrimony, acquired from local ſolicitude of them internally, and accumulation; beſides, they are diuretic, (Page 173.) and antiſeptic, (Page 192.) without aſtringency, or being productive of heat.</p>
                  <p>Though, in order to keep up theſe effects, ſo eſſentially neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for recovery, phyſicians in general have ordered mild cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liquids <hi>to be drank cold,</hi> if the ſkin was dry and hot, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and thirſt conſiderable—and <hi>lukewarm,</hi> whilſt the patient was in a ſtate of perſpiration; and very judiciouſly forbid the uſe of cordial ſtimulants, caudles, wines, and heating medicines of every kind:—yet ſome preſcribe a cup of chamomile tea to be drank every hour; but as this, like other bitters, is a ſtimulant, in the inflammatory ſtage of this diſeaſe it does not appear proper. But when ſymptoms of putreſcency are approaching, or commenced, it may be productive of good effects, as it poſſeſſes antiſeptic (Page 192.) powers. Small and repeated doſes of lukewarm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luents, or watery liquids, as rennet, vinegar whey, lemonade, toaſt and water, ſlight infuſion of malt, hydromel of Hippocrates, (Page 178.) or things of a ſimilar nature, anſwer the purpoſes more ſafely, and full as effectually.</p>
                  <p>Though the greateſt benefit is expected to be derived from clearing the firſt paſſages, attention ſhould alſo be paid to the ſtomach;—and hence, if nauſea, ſickneſs, or vomiting, be one of the concomitant ſymptoms, that organ muſt be attended to, and unloaded of its contents; which will contribute alſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the effects before mentioned; but as the womb is ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the broad ligaments, (51.) and thoſe called round, (which are formed of a number of blood-veſſels folded together, running from the corners of the womb in the duplicature of the broad ligaments, paſs through a round aperture on each ſide the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the belly, and are loſt in the fat of each groin) vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be promoted by the eaſieſt means, by drinking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of chamomile tea, or warm water—for by filling the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ſufficiently with fluid, its coats will act with eaſe, and the diaphragm (23.) and muſcles of the belly not be thrown into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and too powerful contraction, which would at this period be dangerous; becauſe the ligaments are now in a relaxed ſtate, and have not yet recovered their natural and healthful tone; hence would the womb be liable to be protruded too much down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by ſtrong exertions of vomiting.</p>
                  <p>The caſe here drawn up reſpects only the moſt ſimple appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of this fever; but it is frequently obſerved to be attended with ſeveral untoward circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="unknown:028021_0243_0FD672190A85EC88"/>
1ſt. VIOLENT STITCHES IN THE SIDE, and PAIN AT THE PIT OF THE STOMACH will accompany thoſe more conſtant ones of the belly, with a full, hard pulſe, ſymptoms of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that ſevere in proportion to the degree of violence.</p>
                  <p>2d. FLATULENCES in the ſtomach and colon (43.) will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce pains in the ſides, ſhooting about the ſhort ribs, which fluctuate; and occaſion ſhortneſs of breathing, being only attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſlight degree of fever.</p>
                  <p>3d. A COUGH not unfrequently is an attendant ſymptom—but ſeldom of much conſequence.</p>

                  <p>Theſe we muſt endeavour to alleviate by well-adapted appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. <hi>Under the firſt circumſtances</hi> bleeding muſt be had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, and that repeatedly, if the violence of the ſymptoms continues, paying proper attention to the ſtrength of the patient; taking care not to be too laviſh in the quantity of blood drawn; for it is ſafer to bleed twice than once too copiouſly. Should the pains be violent, and the breathing much oppreſſed, bliſters muſt be applied immediately, and repeated in proportion to the cauſe, firſt on the ſide affected, afterwards on the oppoſite ſide.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould the pulſe grow weak, and other ſymptoms of debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity come on, declaratory of putreſcency taking place, cordials with tonics, the moſt powerful of which are, volatiles united with bark—camphor—ſpirit of vitriolic or nitrous aethermuſt be brought to our aid and mineral acids. See Putrid Fever, 221, § 4. from whence we ſhall be referred to a variety of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions capable of anſwering our purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>And here we muſt obſerve, that the ſeneka root, (Page 179.) has been highly recommended in this, as well as other pleuritic affections; and is in this place conſidered as exceedingly applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as it is ſaid to promote ſtools, urine, and ſweat.</p>

                  <p>We have now gone through that ſeries of fevers, of the four firſt of which, <hi>all,</hi> either in their ſeparate or conjunct ſtate, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be denominated, conſiſt; and it clearly appears, that the parts of the conſtitution which are affected, are thoſe which form the moving powers, (56.) and that it is by the morbid alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their action alone that fevers are produced; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is from regulating their motions, and reducing them to a proper ſtandard, that we can derive benefit in our curative, as well as preventive attempts; for inſtance:</p>
                  <p>IN THE SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER we find a ſuperabundance of blood, and irritable ſtate of the vaſcular ſyſtem put into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:028021_0245_0FD6721B65C74B90"/>
by ſome remote cauſe, occaſioning increaſe of action—<hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to cure,</hi> we leſſen the former, and decreaſe the latter—for here we ſuppoſe not any contamination of the circulating fluids to have taken place.</p>
                  <p>IN THE INFLAMMATORY FEVER we find to the ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of blood is added a morbid tenacity, and to the irritability a morbid augmentation of vaſcular ſtrength and firmneſs—<hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to cure,</hi> our efforts are the ſame as in the former caſe, only more powerfully, copiouſly, and quickly exerted, with intent to thin the fluids, and debilitate the force of vaſcular action, as well as leſſen the quantity of blood, and decreaſe the quickneſs of vaſcular motion.</p>
                  <p>IN THE NERVOUS we find a different conſtitutional ſtate of the moving powers—a torpor of the vaſcular ſyſtem—ropy vicidity of the ſerous or lymphatic fluids—with a morbid activity of the nervous ſyſtem—<hi>in order to cure,</hi> we endeavour to rouſe the nerves to the performance of their due action, and increaſe the irritability of the ſanguinary veſſels through the habit.</p>
                  <p>IN THE PUTRID we find, added to one or other of the ſtates of the vaſcular or nervous ſyſtem, a putreſcent ſtate of the fluids, either from the abſorption of putrid particles, or the generation of them in the habit—<hi>in order to cure,</hi> we attempt to ſupport the vigour of the ſyſtem, and correct the putreſcent acrimony of the fluids, according to the affection of the moving powers—if of the inflammatory kind, by mitigating their too violent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—if of the nervous, by rouſing their active powers, ſo that in due time the offenſive matter may be ſeparated from, and thrown out of the maſs of fluids, by ſome of the outlets of the machine; which is the caſe in all other fevers that deduce their origin from any peccant matter in the habit.</p>
                  <p>And we may venture to aſſert, that any practitioner who cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudies, and perfectly underſtands the nature and management of the four kinds of fevers ſpecified above, will be fully compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to conduct his patient, in the beſt manner, through every kind of fever, be its nature ever ſo apparently complicated.</p>
                  <p>But, beſides the fevers we have particularized, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, denominated according to their form or mode of progreſs REMITTENT or INTERMITTENT, though they really are of the nature of thoſe of which we have before treated, either in their ſeparate or conjunct ſtate; and which we muſt now proceed to explain.</p>

            <head>SECTION IX. CHAP. I. REMITTENT FEVER.</head>
            <p>FEVERS of this kind receive their name from the mode which they preſerve through their progreſs, ſteering betwixt thoſe of the continued and the intermittent claſs; for though the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver does not preſerve throughout an equal degree of violence as in the former, there is never a total ceſſation of febrile affection before its termination, as in the latter. Theſe fevers, therefore move betwixt the two extremes; having, inſtead of freſh acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as they are called in intermittents, only repeated increaſe of action, denominated exacerbations; between which a degree of vaſcular contraction and proſtration of ſtrength are continued, indicative of the preſence of the febrile cauſe ſtill in action; and from hence they take their name.</p>
            <p>But, indeed, the remiſſions are ſometimes ſo ſlight, that they are with difficulty diſtinguiſhed by the cloſeſt attention from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fevers—though this diſcrimination is highly neceſſary, as they yield more in their mode of cure to that we ſhall find em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in intermittents, being ſubdued with more certainty by the bark, <hi>judiciouſly adminiſtered,</hi> than by any other application. Indeed, they ſeem to have ſo great affinity with the continued and intermittent fever, that they ſometimes run into one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into the other—and the continued, before it becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent perfectly, will aſſume the remittent type, ſo will the intermittent before it changes into a continued.</p>
            <p>From ſome appearances occurring in the courſe of theſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, they have been divided into <hi>quotidian—tertian</hi>—or <hi>quarta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>—according as the remiſſion has happened on the ſecond, third, or fourth day; but in this diviſion there appears to be no prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical utility—as it leads not to any particular mode of cure, nor aſſiſts in diſtinguiſhing the nature of them, whether they verge moſt to the inflammatory claſs, which knowledge alone muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine our operations.</p>
            <p>DESCRIPTION. They, like other fevers, generally begin with alternate chills and heat, ſtretching and yawning; and theſe are ſucceeded by nauſea, vomiting of bile, giddineſs, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion—then commences the fever, and the heat continues; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe follow pain of the head, back, and limbs—heart-burn—and 
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:028021_0247_0FD6721CCA4B25A8"/>
thirſt—difficult breathing—anxiety—inquietude—and, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the firſt attack, delirium—the ſtomach ſwells now and then—the eyes are generally tinged with a yellow colour, and that diffuſed over the whole body not unfrequently—the tongue is white and moiſt—the pulſe ſometimes hard, ſeldom full—the bowels are at one time obſtructed, at another the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
            <p>Thus ſituated are ſome periods betwixt the ſecond and eighth day; which time a remiſſion very rarely exceeds; for the moſt part a gentle ſweat will come on, and brings an alleviation of all the febrile ſymptoms; and this continues for ſome hours; after which, generally in the evening, the violence of the fever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, ſometimes preceded by chillneſs, ſometimes not.</p>
            <p>This repetition hath no fixed time for its continuance, in ſome remaining a longer, in others a ſhorter ſpace; but at laſt gives way in its degree of violence, and remits a ſecond time; and thus continues fluctuating till either totally ſubdued by nature or art—or death cloſes the ſcene.</p>
            <p>When this laſt is the caſe, the patient often dies in the parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſm, or renewal of the attack—the brain is immediately affected—he loſes his ſenſes, and the power of ſpeech—his breathing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes quick—deglutition is impeded—a looſeneſs comes on—the pulſe in the beginning ſoft, not to be called weak, nor indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative of danger, in a few hours is ſmall and depreſſed, then cold ſweats break out, and the unhappy victim expires.</p>
            <p>Theſe fevers have, by ſome, been ſtiled <hi>bilious,</hi> from the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of bile, ſo common in their commencement, and the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuffuſion on the ſkin and whites of the eyes; ſuppoſing theſe ſymptoms to ariſe from the ſuperabundance of bilious excretion, and the activity of the bile reſorbed into the habit, occaſioning ſuch febrile commotions—But it is obvious this change of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is owing to another cauſe, and <hi>that,</hi> the breaking down of the texture of the blood from the putreſcent tendency of the fluids; and thus may the colour more properly be accounted for; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bile may be returned into the blood, as in the jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, without producing theſe febrile attacks.</p>
            <p>In hot countries that are marſhy, where the atmoſphere is filled from thence with putrid exhalations, they are <hi>endemial,</hi> that is, nalive and reſident—with us, and other parts of Europe, they have been obſerved to become <hi>epidemical,</hi> that is, occaſionally ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, towards the latter end of autumn.</p>
            <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are ſaid by ſome, as well as the <hi>proximate,</hi> to be ſuch as bring on a continued, or inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory, or a putrid fever, (209, 221.) whilſt others attribute <hi>the firſt</hi> to too great moiſture in the air, <hi>the laſt</hi> to inſenſible perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:028021_0248_0FD6725D34243C70"/>
impeded, and a relaxed ſtate of fibres. However, from the hiſtory of theſe fevers, it is obvious, that they, at different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, and in different conſtitutions, put on appearances which are very different, and according to which we are to regulate our conduct. Hence we ſay, the</p>
            <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS are, a remiſſion or abatement, not a total ceſſation of febrile affections, ſucceeded by percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exacerbation, or increaſe of febrile violence; which increaſe is <hi>ſometimes</hi> uſhered in with chillneſs;—and if there are ſtrong ſymptoms of vaſcular contraction, and great increaſe of circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory motion, which are declared by <hi>extreme heat—thirſt</hi>—and <hi>pain</hi>—having a <hi>dry ſkin, ſtrong, hard, and full pulſe,</hi> for their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, we ſhall not heſitate to pronounce it INFLAMMATORY;—but if attended with <hi>great debility—lowneſs of ſpirits—nauſea—oppreſſion—vomiting</hi>—coupled with <hi>diſcolouration of the ſkin, and languid pulſe,</hi> its belonging to the putrid claſs is indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>This fever is never free from danger; though the nearer it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to an intermittent, or the leſs degree of fever continues during the remiſſion, ſo much more favourable the omen; but, on the contrary, the more it puts on the appearance of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued fever, the ſhorter the remiſſion, and more violent the fever fit, ſo much the more dangerous. If the urine, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a deep colour, becomes pale, we have great reaſon for fear—If it changes its remittent for a continued type, the event is doubtful—and when the brain is affected, and the reſt of the ſymptoms, as deſcribed (Page 251. line 19, &amp;c.) death is near at hand.</p>
            <p>CURE. The indications are ſimilar to what we have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the inflammatory (209) and putrid (221) fevers, adapted to peculiar ſtates agreeing with them, by which this fever may be changed into an intermittent, or totally taken off—conſequently, where the inflammatory ſymptoms are prevalent, bleeding, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purges and glyſters—vomits—and ſmall doſes of antimonials—watery diluting liquids drank plentifully—cooling aceſcent ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables—will be the moſt eligible at the commencement, and will ſo far anſwer the purpoſe in ſome caſes, that nature after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may be almoſt left to herſelf.</p>
            <p>Still, in others, ſhe requires the moſt immediate and powerful aſſiſtance—hence it is neceſſary to point out the different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive appearances, by which may be diſcovered the ſituation of ſafety, or danger, and the mode of proper management under each, as, from imprudent conduct, this fever, from its mildeſt ſtate may be converted into that of extreme peril, and from this laſt into certain death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="unknown:028021_0249_0FD6721E41DA9C00"/>
If, therefore, the increaſe of the febrile affections, a third time, ſhould not be more violent, nor of longer continuance than that which preceded, but nearly ſimilar. If the urine ſhould let fall a laudable ſediment, without any viſible decreaſe of ſtrength, or increaſed dejection of ſpirits, matters will wear a favourable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: and about the fourth or fifth return of the fever, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the conſtitution will commonly relieve themſelves by ſome critical evacuation, either by the KIDNEYS, SKIN, INTESTINES, SALIVARY SYSTEM, or LUNGS, manifeſted in <hi>turpid urine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſweat, bilious ſtools, copious ſpitting,</hi> or <hi>expectoration of matter of a yellow caſt</hi>—for the fever generally reſolves itſelf in one or more of theſe ways.</p>
            <p>But, on the fifth return, ſhould there appear to be an increaſe in degrees of ſeverity, in the ſymptoms becoming more acute and dangerous—if the ſit continues longer, and is more violent than before, and there are obviouſly a ſinking and lowneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with great debility of the powers of the ſyſtem, we muſt have recourſe to bliſters, which ſome indeed adviſe at an earlier period, as calculated in a remarkable manner to bring on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent type—and bark as ſoon as poſſible in the remiſſion; forty or ſixty grains of the powder may be adminiſtered every ſecond or third hour—or, if the ſtomach will not bear this quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, a ſmaller doſe be given at ſhorter periods, or the decoction, (193.) hot or cold infuſion, (No. 41.) with or without the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles or aromatics, as ſeem neceſſary; to which alſo may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally added, the other preparations of this medicine, (193, 194.) by theſe means many endeavour to ſtop, or at leaſt retard the progreſs of the next febrile fit, by throwing into the habit a ſufficient quantity—and thus muſt we proceed till we ſhall be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered within twelve or fourteen hours to adminiſter ſix or eight drams.</p>
            <p>If we are not active at this period, and attempt not with all our power to mitigate or conquer the febrile affections, we run the riſque of protracting the diſeaſe, and rendering it more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with danger; for now the fits become ſo quick, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing each other ſo rapidly, that we are deprived of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of throwing in the bark in proper quantity, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a continued fever to be the conſequence.</p>
            <p>But though bark in ſome ſtates of this fever is ſo extremely uſeful, ſtill, in every ſtage it is not neceſſary—nay, indeed, in the inflammatory remittents (251.) it is dangerous to adminiſter it, whilſt the action of the veſſels are too powerful; for from this we might produce the inflammatory continued fever; therefore we muſt endeavour to lower the ſyſtem, by thoſe means adviſed,
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:028021_0250_0FD67261EA13B2B0"/>
(252, line 33.)—that done, the bark may then be advantageouſly thrown in.</p>
            <p>Before we cloſe the account of this fever, we muſt obſerve, that though bleeding, and that repeatedly, has been adviſed in ſome of theſe fevers, and with conſiderable advantage; yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome circumſtances there requires the niceſt caution, with reſpect to the quantity to be taken away, notwithſtanding the commencement being uſhered in with ſuch ſymptoms, as might authoriſe the operation; for bleeding has been allowed to do miſchief, eſpecially in hot countries, for there theſe fevers are generally of the putrid kind—therefore in our firſt bleedings the quantity ſhould be moderate, ſeldom exceeding eight ounces—which may be repeated in caſe the inflammatory ſymptoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue violent—but ſhould theſe only be ſlight at firſt, and evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations are neceſſary to be promoted, we can only depend upon the gentleſt cathartics, ſuch as oil of caſtor, manna, tartarized kali, Polychreſt ſalt, and tartarized antimony—(See Cathartics, Simple continued, and Inflammatory fevers, where different for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulae will be found) and alſo the ſaline mixture—which laſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, is ſaid to be the moſt certain alleviator of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent nauſea and vomiting, which generally attend theſe caſes—or it may be given in its ſtate of fermentation, (No. 59.) and is greatly aſſiſtant in correcting the putrid diſpoſition, and thoſe foulneſſes which are collected in the ſtomach and flexure of the duodenum—(42.) afterwards the bark muſt be freely applied. By theſe means thouſands have been ſaved; and if they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with before the ſtrength of the patient is exhauſted, and will properly purſue the advice given, ſeldom any die of this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>However in the Weſt Indies in this fever there is ſomething very ſingular, for it has been obſerved, that if the bark was not given on the firſt remiſſion, it was apt to run into the continued ſpecies.</p>
            <p>There are innumerable varieties of theſe fevers mentioned by authors, who have given them different names, according to ſome peculiar circumſtances which attended—but all yield to the mode of treatment here pointed out—only in ſome paying particular attention to any uncommon ſymptom which occurred—two of which we ſhall point out.</p>

               <p>This attacks generally in the middle of Auguſt, and is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beſides the common ſymptoms, with violent pain of the head, and often with delirium, which ſymptoms continue in the night, vaniſh in the day-time, after ſweating, a haemorrhage or looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

               <p>In order to prevent the attacks of the remittent fevers, as they are chiefly the children of moiſt ſeaſons, and low marſhy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, we ſhould keep good fires, with intent to correct the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheric humidity—make uſe of aromatics—avoid the evening and morning air—drink red wine—uſe exerciſe and the cold bath—take bark once or twice a day, mixed with bitters—and ſmoak tobacco—for people who have obſerved theſe rules have, many of them, eſcaped in countries where this fever has raged epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically, and afflicted numbers who have deſpiſed theſe cautions.</p>

            <head>SECTION X. INTERMITTENT FEVER.</head>
            <p>THESE fevers receive their name from the nature of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, having a perfect ceſſation of febrile affections from
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028021_0252_0FD672647418F9A0"/>
the termination of one fit to the beginning of another, and may be conſidered as continued fevers of ſhort duration, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many febrile fits, the fever returning at ſtated periods; for in every fit the courſe of a continued fever is run through—the coldneſs and ſhivering is the beginning—the hot ſit the height—and the ſweating generally attendant, or at leaſt a gentle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration the criſis or termination. What happens in theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtages is thus properly deſcribed:</p>
            <p>DESCRIPTION. IN THE FIRST STAGE it begins with yawning and ſtretching, and a certain indeſcribable ſenſation in the back and the ends of the fingers; after theſe ſucceed exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive coldneſs, inſomuch, that it occaſions violent ſhaking of the whole body, and chattering of the teeth; ſtill, in fact, the blood is in a ſtate of increaſed, rather than diminiſhed heat—there are alſo nauſea, and ſometimes vomiting attendant, with pains of the back, head, and limbs—the ends of the noſe, ears, lips, and cheeks grow pale—the nails livid—the breathing is difficult—the urine pale and limpid—the pulſe weak, and extremely quick—and this cold fit continues for one, two, three, four, or five hours ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, at others only half an hour before the hot fit commences—which forms the</p>
            <p>SECOND STAGE, in which there is extreme degree of heat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſucceeding the cold, which goes off gradually: in this the pulſe becomes full, quick, and ſtrong—the head is painful—and ſometimes the patients are delirious—their breathing is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and free—the tongue white, attended with great thirſt—at the pit of the ſtomach they complain of much heat, have pain there, and ſometimes ſwelling—the urine is high coloured—and when blood is taken from the arm it is more denſe than uſual, particularly in ſpring—ſometimes in unwholeſome ſituations and ſeaſons the ſuperior part is red, the inferior black, with a ſmall portion of ſerum, and that leſs coheſive than when in health. At the commencement of the</p>
            <p>THIRD STAGE there breaks out a general and copious ſweat, which alleviates the extreme heat, and mitigates all the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which, on the ſweat continuing for ſome hours, totally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes—the urine depoſits a ſediment like brick-duſt—the patient falls into a ſound ſleep—and thus the fit cloſes with a ceſſation of all the febrile ſymptoms; and this, called the intermiſſion, in which the patient feels ſome degree of debility, has much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to ſweat, and little or no appetite.</p>
            <p>It has been thought that we could prognoſticate the violence of the hot, by the degrees of the duration of the cold fit, for the longer the latter continued, the more ſevere would be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer—
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:028021_0253_0FD67225CB283F38"/>
—but this is erroneous, for the ſenſation of cold grows weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in long continued intermittents.</p>
            <p>In ſome countries theſe fevers are peculiar, as the fens of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeſhire, Lincolnſhire, the low parts of Kent, the marſhes of Eſſex, and in places where there is much moiſture, and the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation low; and here they generally appear in ſpring or autumn. They ſeldom viſit other places, except in ſeaſons adapted to their propagation, and then they become epidemic.</p>
            <p>They have been divided into vernal and autumnal, endemical and epidemical, and into <hi>quotidian,</hi> where from the termination of one fit to the beginning of another the ſpace of 24 hours is conſumed—<hi>tertian,</hi> where that of 48—<hi>quartan,</hi> where of 72—and when longer, erratic. They have alſo been divided far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but they ſeem to be of no practical uſe, as the modes of cure in all are very ſimilar.</p>
            <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, immoderate evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—cold moiſt atmoſphere—irregular or improper diet of crude watery vegetables—lowneſs of ſpirits—crudities in the firſt paſſages—and, in fine, every thing which contributes to produce a relaxed ſtate of the ſolids, and poverty of the blood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> effluvia from moiſt, marſhy places called marſh miaſma—impeded perſpiration, and relaxation of the ſolids.</p>
            <p>Hence are the poor more ſubject to this diſeaſe than the rich and affluent, thoſe who inhabit the country more than thoſe who live in large towns and populous cities; for generous diet and warmth are preſervatives againſt the diſeaſe as well by purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the air, as invigorating the habit.</p>
            <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Affections of both the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and vaſcular ſyſtems, from marſh effluvia running through the courſe of a continued fever, of ſhort duration, beginning with cold and ſhivering, ſucceeded by great heat, and terminating, for the moſt part, in profuſe ſweats, in one fit, which leaves the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit perfectly free from fever for ſome time, and returns at ſtated periods.</p>
            <p>CURE. The indications are, to prevent the return of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile affections, by taking off the too great incitability of the nervous, and irritability of the vaſcular ſyſtem, by giving tone or ſtrength to the nerves and veſſels, and rendering them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of feeling the effect of morbid particles in the habits, called marſh miaſmata, and ejecting them out of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But at the commencement of fevers we cannot immediately diſcover of what particular nature they are, and one the leaſt
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028021_0254_0FD67265C204F7C0"/>
dangerous may be converted into others which are more hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by injudicious treatment, as an intermittent into a remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and this into a continued; we ſhould at the firſt onſet be careful, till we are convinced of its ſpecific nature; therefore to general means we ſhould only have recourſe, which may in all fevers be proper, be they of what ſort they may, and this will depend on placing the conſtitution under ſuch circumſtances as approach nearer to a ſtate of health.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in the beginning, if the pulſe give evident ſigns of fullneſs, with other concomitant ſymptoms, which indicate eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations to be proper, as we have before ſpecified in the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and other fevers, blood may be taken from the arm. Should there be nauſea or ſickneſs, indicative of foulneſs of the ſtomach, an emetic, (No. 11, 12. 38.) ſhould be adminiſtered, and the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els cleared by ſome gentle aperient medicine. (No. 3. 22 to 24.)</p>
            <p>Where theſe are thought neceſſary, bleeding and cathartics ſhould precede the adminiſtration of the emetic, that no miſchief may ariſe from its operation, which might be the caſe, ſhould there be any local congeſtion, or too great general fullneſs, by rupturing, or diſtending the veſſels too much, or puſhing the blood too powerfully into the ſmall capillary tubes, particularly of the head.</p>
            <p>If theſe prove inſufficient, we muſt proceed to the uſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonials in ſmall doſes, united with the ſaline mixture, or alone, (No. 6 to 9.) as has been before directed—and, as ſoon as the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhews what it is, take ſuch ſteps as its nature demands—if an intermittent, the moſt powerful medicine, with which obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and experience has furniſhed us, is the Peruvian bark, (193, 194.)—the quantity given ſhould be generally ſo much in the interval between the fits as will prevent their return, that is, in adults, from fix to eight drams.</p>
            <p>The moſt efficacious mode of adminiſtration that has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, is in powder mixed with red wine.</p>
            <p>Where the intermiſſion is ſhort, it is given at ſhorter intervals and vice verſa. I always conſider what is moſt agreeable to the patient reſpecting the form, and give a doſe every one, two, three, or four hours, as occaſion requires—the nearer the approach of the uſual time of acceſſion, the quicker it ſhould be repeated, in order that it may at that time exert its fulleſt action with its greateſt power.</p>
            <p>Should the febrile fits be by theſe means conquered, we muſt not totally deſiſt from its uſe, but for a few days repeat it at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intervals, every fifth or ſixth hour; then for a week, twice
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:028021_0255_0FD6722746727B70"/>
in the twenty-four hours; afterwards, once for the ſame, ſpace.</p>
            <p>In winter, after deſiſting for a week, or ten days, it will be prudent to return to it again occaſionally for two or three days, and ſo perſiſt for a few times, which will effectually ſecure the patient from a relapſe. Add to this, the patient ſhould avoid expoſing himſelf to the remote or inducing cauſes, (257.) uſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle exerciſe, particularly riding—light nutritious diet—animal food—red port, claret, or any generous wine, in proper quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties—ſuch as are eaſily digeſted, will ſerve to ſtrengthen the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, and promote a free and regular circulation.</p>
            <p>Large draughts of any kind of liquids, however thirſty the patient may be, ſhould not be allowed in the cold fit, as they will load the ſtomach too much, and increaſe internal oppreſſion and uneaſineſs; but in the hot fit, watery fluids, ſuch as ſage, roſemary, balm-tea, ſmall white-wine whey, and ſuch like, may be liberally adminiſtered.</p>
            <p>The forms in which the bark is adminiſtered, are either in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, pills, electuary, decoction, infuſion with cold or hot water, ſimple powder, tincture, or extract. (See the doſes, 193, 194.)</p>
            <p>When we want to throw in as much as poſſible in a given time, (ſee No. 70.) and let it be adminiſtered every ſecond, third, or fourth hour, according to the times of the febrile acceſſions. (258.)</p>
            <p>Where bark has diſagreed, equal portions of quaſſia wood and ſnake-root, infuſed in boiling water, or oak bark in powder, or extract alone, joined with alum, or chamomile flowers, have been efficacious, given during the intermiſſions every three or four hours, (No. 71, 72.)—the virtues alſo of cupulae, or ſcaly cup, which embraces the bottom of the acorn, are ſimilar, in a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree, to the oak bark.</p>
            <p>The method above laid down will generally be ſucceſsful in the quotidian and tertian intermittents, (257.) particularly if we couple ſuch medicines along with the bark as the nature of the conſtitution of the patient, and the apparent febrile ſymptoms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, <abbr>viz.</abbr> if the habit appears robuſt, the pulſe, in the febrile fit, full, hard, and quick, with other inflammatory ſymptoms, bleeding has been greatly beneficial; and in theſe caſes, joining the bark with ſaline ſubſtances, as tartarized kali neutralized with lemon juice, (No. 1.) and the decoction of bark, or fixed ſal am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, (176.)—if contrary appearances, cordials and volatiles have ſupplied their places, as volatile ſalt of hartſhorn, (150.) tincture of ſnake-root. (179.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="unknown:028021_0256_0FD67267612B8BF0"/>
Notwithſtanding which, they will ſometimes prove very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate—in theſe caſes vomits (No. 11, 12. 38.) given a ſmall ſpace of time before the return of the fit, and antimonials in ſmall doſes, (230.) purſued through the courſe of the hot fit, have been found beneficial—or, where the habit has been in a highly irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſtate, opium, (152.) adminiſtered before the fit, or in the hot ſtage, ſeemed of uſe.</p>
            <p>It is only though in the quartan (257.) intermittent that they are often required, ſeldom in the others preceding, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hot and cold fits continue a ſhorter time than the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the whole fit ſeldom laſting above five hours.</p>
            <p>Bark ſeldom fails of completing a cure, if judiciouſly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and the concomitant circumſtances which ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, are properly attended to—when it does, the failure is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome of the following particulars—either it has been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in too ſmall doſes—not perſiſted in long enough—given in an improper form—or ſuch medicines may not have been added to it, nor ſuch a regimen obſerved, as the peculiar nature of the caſe required.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the bark has a tendency to paſs off through the bowels, then it is neceſſary to add a few drops of tincture of opium to each doſe, which will prevent that effect—at others the habit will be too coſtive, eight or ten grains of rhubarb may be given ſoon after the ceſſation of the fit, to obviate that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience—ſometimes the ſtomach will not bear it, it may then be adminiſtered in form of glyſter, (No. 73.)</p>
            <p>It is ſometimes extremely difficult, and very often impoſſible, to get children to take a ſufficient quantity of this medicine to anſwer the deſired purpoſe—for the beſt form to which they will adhere the longeſt, (See No. 74.)</p>
            <p>But they have been cured by baths, in which half their body has been immerſed, of bark decoction, rubbing the ſpine with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts of ſoap liniment and tincture of opium—or wearing a waiſtcoat made of callico doubled, within which bark has been quilted.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to our prognoſtics in this diſeaſe, when eruptions appear upon the lips, they afford a good omen; and the more regularly the fever paſſes through its ſtages, ſo much the better. Epidemic fevers of this kind are worſe than thoſe which occur accidentally to a few—quartans than quotidians or tertians—autumnal, than vernal—Inflammation of the tonſils is conſidered as mortal—ſometimes it carries off thoſe who are very infirm in the firſt ſtage—they frequently leave the conſtitution extremely weak, ſo that it requires a long time for the re-eſtabliſhment of perfect health; which muſt be aſſiſted by proper regimen, and
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:028021_0257_0FD67228B32097B0"/>
exerciſe, as has before been ſpecified, after the termination of other ſevere fevers—ſometimes they terminate in jaundice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, and dropſies, which, if they ariſe from ſcirrhoſities, or hard irreſoluble tumours of the viſcera, are fatal.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding what may be thought, with reſpect to the neceſſity of an early cure, it is not always proper to take off this fever immediately—for by their continuance, they have been known to cure epilepſy, ſevere coughs from affections of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; alſo hypochondriac and gouty affections have diſappeared, by this fever bringing about, from its continuance, ſome ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſtitutional changes—the bleeding piles, ſmall-pox, and other acute fevers, as well as ſtrong mental affections, have been known, on the other hand, to ſubdue the ague.</p>

         <div n="11" type="section">
            <head>SECTION XI. HECTIC FEVER, OR CHRONIC REMITTENT FEVER WITHOUT CRISIS.</head>
            <p>THUS would I wiſh to denominate this fever, becauſe the word HECTIC, except from long continued cuſtom alone, gives us no determinate idea reſpecting it; and where any complaint is peculiarly marked by any known cauſe or ſymptoms, by which it deviates from all others of the ſame claſs, and by which from them it may be diſtinguiſhed, can be confined in a very ſhort compaſs, by terms expreſſive of that peculiarity would I have it marked down. As, therefore, hectic fever is of longer duration than any other remittent fever, goes off, when curable, by no known criſis, and, during the whole courſe, has various exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbations and remiſſions, I have ventured to alter its appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Authors have been much divided with reſpect to this fever, <hi>ſome</hi> conſidering it <hi>always</hi> ſymptomatic, deriving its ſource from ſome local complaint, and depending entirely on that—others, that it may alſo be a primary diſeaſe, neither ariſing from, nor dependent on any other—for the latter opinion I confeſs myſelf an advocate; for, though hectic ſymptoms certainly do derive their ſource from ſcirrhous obſtructions and ulcerations of all the viſcera, more particularly of the lungs (28.) and meſentery, (46.) becauſe it is ſaid the former are expoſed to injuries from the external air, and the force of the blood circulating through
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:028021_0258_0FD67269F6707A48"/>
their ſubſtance; the latter is ſubject to the ſame from compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the aliments in the firſt paſſages, from viſcid chyle, (43.) and the ſlower circulation of the blood through the inteſtines; ſtill may they ariſe immediately from ſome acrimony of the blood, becauſe they have occurred certainly where no one viſcus, through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, was affected more than the reſt; nor do the viſceral obſtructions, which are always found on diſſection, deſtroy the validity of this opinion; for they are the effects, as well as cauſes, of hectic fevers—of which we ſhall be convinced, if we will only examine the remote or inducing cauſes, which we ſhall ſhortly ſpecify.</p>
            <p>DESCRIPTION. The ſymptoms are very ſimilar to what appear in conſumption of the lungs—the patients labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this complaint have a continued, dry, unnatural heat; they loſe their appetite, and their pulſe is ſmall, weak, and frequent, though fuller and ſtronger after eating; they have no ſenſation of ſickneſs; after meals a fluſhing of the cheeks comes on; and their urine is in general red, and covered with an oily pellicle; their ſleep by no means refreſhes them; they become hollow-ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; their ſkin grows harſh, the belly ſinks inwards; a colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive looſeneſs comes on, the body grows t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bid, and death makes its approach by ſlow degrees.</p>
            <p>On this fever the ſagacious Dr. Heberden has made ſeveral uſeful remarks in the London Medical Tranſactions, Vol. II. page 1, &amp;c. amongſt which he ſays, <q>the moſt certain mark of this fever is, when the ſweat, which uſually attends this fever, is over; the fever will ſometimes continue, and in the middle the chillneſs will return.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is very readily diſtinguiſhed from all other fevers by the ſlowneſs of its progreſs—but from the firſt ſtage of the watery head, with great difficulty, and not without the moſt aſſiduous attention to the ſymptoms peculiar to each.</p>
            <p>CAUSES. <hi>Remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, immoderate and long continued mental affections—long watchings—too great evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether of blood, milk, ſemen, ſaliva, pus, ſweat, or the alvine fluids—too acrid medicines, as mercurial preparations, ſtrong purges, too often repeated—debility of the firſt paſſages, by which the chyle, either crude or corrupted, is conveyed into the circulating maſs of fluids—preceding diſeaſes, as intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, ſmall-pox, meaſles, dropſy, ſcurvy, king's evil ſo called—ſuppreſſed evacuations—frequent intoxication—old people and infants are alſo ſubject to it, from their age alone, dependent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſtitutional debility.</p>
            <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> both from the preceding cauſes, and the modes of cure, are ſaid to be, a ſaline and alcaleſcent
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:028021_0259_0FD6722F902A2730"/>
ſtate of the fluids—whether this may be the preciſe caſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be difficult to determine—though mucilaginous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials and acids are ſaid to be beneficial, yet it is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſome ſpecies of acrimony takes place in the habit, as the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle of this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Febrile affections long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, having frequent increaſe of violence, no perceptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, and not terminating in criſis, attended with irregular vaſcular action increaſing often in the day, more ſo in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and generally at the beginning with tenacity, towards the termination, with putreſcency of the blood.</p>
            <p>CURE. The indications are, to mitigate febrile affections, and correct the acrimony of the fluids.</p>
            <p>If care is taken of this complaint at an early period, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per advice adminiſtered, a cure may be effected—but, under theſe circumſtances, patients often delay too long, and confide either in their own imaginary knowledge, or the family receipts of ſome humane old woman, till little chance remains for the ſkill of the more judicious; for when the powers of the conſtitution become to be greatly debilitated—the hair falls off—a colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſſolving looſeneſs, night ſweats, and ſwellings of the legs come on—the urine begins to have an oily appearance, and the countenance aſſumes a cadaverous aſpect, becoming thin and ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all proſpect of warding off the fatal blow is irrecoverably gone, the patient is got beyond the reach of our art, and death quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſes the fatal ſcene.</p>
            <p>In the beginning, where we can be of ſervice, we muſt firſt of all clear <hi>the ſtomach and bowels</hi> by gentle emetics, (No. 11, 12.) and mild aperients, chiefly rhubarb—<hi>abate the febrile heat</hi> by ſmall doſes of Polychreſt ſalt, (171.) and nitre, (177.) and giving ſuch doſes of oil of caſtor, manna, or ſome ſuch like cooling and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opening medicines, as will keep the body free from coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (171, 172.)—<hi>in order to ſheath the acrimony of the fluids,</hi> we muſt have recourſe to demulcents, (187.) emollients, (137.) and particularly, which will be more effectual, to a well-regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diet and regimen.</p>
            <p>The food ſhould conſiſt of chicken broth, jellies, and if the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach will bear them, oyſters—milk, particularly women's or aſs'—goat's whey—buttermilk, with Briſtol or Seltzer water. The patient ſhould live in a clear country air, on a dry ſoil; keep cheerful company; ride conſtantly on horſeback, or travel from place to place—or he ſhould take a voyage to ſea, or ſail every day, for that has been known to ſave numbers in the beginning of this diſeaſe, and ſome who were rather advanced; but to all it affords great relief. And at the ſame time, with intent to keep
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:028021_0260_0FD6726871E9FFF8"/>
up the tone of the ſyſtem, mild aſtringents, ſlight infuſions of bark, one ounce and an half, with ten drops of dilute vitriolic acid may be given twice a day, or two or three ounces of tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of roſes alſo; three or four drams of the conſerve may be mixed with ſix or eight ounces of milk, and taken two or three times, or oftener, in the day;—as for common drink, they ſhould uſe barley-water, decoction of marſh-mallows, linſeed-tea, or that of colts-foot. Briſtol water has been eſteemed highly ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but it is often deferred too late. In the earlieſt ſtages of this diſeaſe it ſhould be applied to, for in them it promiſes to be of the moſt eſſential ſervice, little, as we have before remarked, being capable of being done in the more advanced or latter pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods.</p>

            <p>SO called from the Latin word <hi>erumpo,</hi> to break out, and alſo in medical language EXANTHEMATOUS, from the Greek word <hi>exanthema,</hi> puſtula, a puſtule, becauſe theſe eruptions make their appearance on the ſurface of the ſkin—and this is done by the effort of nature to throw out ſome matter offenſive to the conſtitution, which was creative of diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Now though theſe partake of the nature of ſome of thoſe we have mentioned in Section 8th, ſtill they derive their names from the eruptions with which they are conſtantly accompanied, and of theſe there are ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and varieties—of which we ſhall treat ſeparately, becauſe they require different modes of manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the different effects they produce upon the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>And theſe effects will be aſſiſted or alleviated, by attending more to the habit of the patient than to the ſpecific nature of the morbid particles which produce them; for we know nothing of the materials, or the parts of which they are formed, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be able to find out any ſpecific remedy which can cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, ſo that the diſeaſe, of which they are the ſource, may be ſubdued, by weakening or deſtroying the power inherent in themſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in all our medical exertions, we attempt only to prevent the ill conſequences they are likely to produce, by ſo guarding the conſtitution, that nature may be empowered to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:028021_0261_0FD67230E38458A0"/>
and throw out what would, if ſuffered to remain, prove fatal to the human machine, either producing immediate death, or bringing on other maladies which would in time have a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar termination.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe fevers of which we are going to treat are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infectious, conſequently contagious; for theſe two terms are uſed ſynonymouſly by the moſt learned authorities. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, I would endeavour to make ſome diſcrimination between them, and am warranted in the attempt, if any the leaſt benefit can be derived to ſociety by the obſervance of ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction; to prove which, I aſſert, that there are ſome diſeaſes which are acquired by the particles of morbid matter floating in the circumambient atmoſphere, either from that matter being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled by the lungs, impregnating what we eat or drink; or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed by the inhaling veſſels of the ſkin, noſe, or fauces, whilſt others are communicated from contact alone—hence the former of theſe I would term <hi>infectious,</hi> the latter <hi>contagious;</hi> and for this reaſon the modes of prevention would be different—for in a country or town where the firſt was rife, quitting thoſe places is abſolutely neceſſary; but where the laſt, cautious reſidence in the ſame is ſufficient, avoiding commerce with perſons ſo contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; or touching any materials, which are capable of retaining the contagious matter, that have by them been uſed or handled. Beſides, in this county, it ſhews, in caſes of the plague, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in drawing lines of circumvallation to prevent its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; indeed other modes, from this idea, might be found out of great utility under theſe unhappy circumſtances. Support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe reaſons, I ſhall beg leave to preſerve the difference between the two terms, and proceed to treat on eruptive fevers from infection; and, firſt, on the</p>

               <head>§ 1. SMALL-POX, or POCKS.</head>
               <p>Becauſe we call a ſingle puſtule <hi>pock</hi>—this ſeems to be derived from the Saxon word <hi>pocca,</hi> pocket, or the French <hi>poche,</hi> a ſmall bag. The Latins gave the diſeaſe the term <hi>variolae,</hi> becauſe from the eruptions it altered the appearance of the ſkin.</p>
               <p>This complaint is occaſioned by morbid matter of a peculiar nature abſorbed into the habit from the external air, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of a perſon infected, or from inoculation, either by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling veſſels of the ſkin, lungs, membranes of the noſe and mouth, or firſt paſſages—and has been divided agreeable to the cuticular appearances, into diſtinct, confluent, coherent—or into common, <hi>cryſtalline</hi> eruptions full of thin ſerous matter—<hi>verru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous,</hi>

reſembling warts—or <hi>bloody,</hi> filled with red fluid, or blood in a broken ſtate.</p>
               <p>However generally now we adhere to the terms <hi>diſtinct</hi> and <hi>confluent;</hi> but this ſeems of little uſe in practice; for they may be diſtinct, yet of a very bad kind; and confluent, yet very good; therefore the more eligible diviſion appears to be into <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and <hi>malignant</hi>—the firſt comprehending thoſe which are the leaſt, the laſt, thoſe which are the moſt dangerous.</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe has four ſtages: the firſt, the <hi>febrile,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues three days—2d, the <hi>eruptive,</hi> two days—3d, the <hi>ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> five or ſeven—4th, the <hi>exſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. It generally commences with ſymptoms of an inflammatory fever, from whence the particles of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid virus are conſidered not only highly ſubtilized, but inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory and ſtimulant, attended with nauſea or vomiting—pain in the head and back—tightneſs about the pit of the ſtomach—the patients are very drowſy, ſometimes delirious—in grown people often ſweats break out on the firſt days, and infants are apt to be ſeized with convulſions—the ſkin though, in general, is rather moiſt and ſoft—the upper orifice of the ſtomach ſometimes acutely painful, and alſo the ſides.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſymptoms continue three or four days, on which appear ſmall red ſpecks like flea-bites; which, when preſſed with the finger, may be felt hard in the ſkin, and thus may be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other eruptions, particularly the meaſles, which, on their firſt appearance, are very ſeldom ſo hard, or can be felt in this manner, as not elevating the cuticle ſo much; firſt on the face, and ſcattered on the hands, neck, and breaſt; and with theſe commences <hi>the ſecond ſtage;</hi> from which period the puſtules keep continually increaſing, and diffuſing themſelves over every part of the body; at which time the fever goes off when the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is completed; after this they inflame, begin to be prominent above the ſkin, are painful, hot, and fill about the fifth day; and have round their baſis a circular florid redneſs—the throat alſo is painful, and inflamed commonly—the face begins to ſwell and puff up, for the moſt part, on the ſeventh day, ſo much, that they generally cloſe the eyes, and occaſion blindneſs.</p>
               <p>At this period, the commencement of <hi>the third ſtage,</hi> as if from external irritation, ſoliciting the perfect and complete diſcharge of morbid matter, freſh febrile ſymptoms ariſe, which continue to the ninth, tenth, or eleventh day, according to the ſeverity of the diſeaſe, or quantity of the eruption. The puſtules having acquired their full ſize, moſt of them as big as peaſe, are filled
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:028021_0263_0FD67231EA2C2868"/>
with a whitiſh or yellowiſh matter; this concludes the third ſtage; and then the matter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>zes out at the top of the eruptions, dries, turns of a dark colour, and forms hard ſcabs, and this is in the ſame order in which they made their appearance—and, as the face ſubſides, the feet and hands ſwell, and ſubſide not totally till the fourteenth day, at which period the diſeaſe is conſidered to have completely finiſhed its courſe, which forms the concluſion of <hi>the fourth ſtage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is in general the progreſs of the ſimple or mild ſpecies—though ſometimes another fever, called SECONDARY, will come on, when the eruptions have run ſo together, that they form one uniform cruſt, and by that means obſtruct perſpiration; ſo that, inſtead of the quantity of variolous matter paſſing out of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, it is again re-abſorbed, and the inteſtines are loaded with an offenſive collection of acrid materials, which create a fever of the remittent claſs that often proves fatal.</p>
               <p>But in the confluent ſort there are ſome peculiarities which ought to be ſpecified; and, therefore, we muſt obſerve, that in theſe the puſtules break out ſooner, on the ſecond or third day; the febrile ſymptoms run on with a greater degree of violence—and on the appearance of the eruptions, or a day or two after, which happens now and then in the diſtinct ſort a <hi>ſpitting</hi> will come on, gradually increaſing to a ſalivation in grown people—in infants a <hi>looſeneſs</hi> ſupplies the place—though in common the attendant fever of the ſmall-pox is of the inflammatory kind, yet, in the more complicated ſort, the fever aſſumes a different type, and puts on the appearance either of—1ſt, an <hi>inflammatory remittent</hi>—2dly, <hi>nervous</hi>—3dly, <hi>putrid fever</hi>—or is aſſociated, 4thly, <hi>with ſymptoms of ayſentery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN THE FIRST, the febrile affections run very high, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat, and great proſtration of ſtrength—the ſkin is dry and hot—the arteries, called carotids, running through the neck into the ſuperior parts, throb—the tendons, (22.) grow ſtiff—the eyes are bright, vivid, and full of blood—the head and loins are painful, often without any delirium or drowſy diſpoſition—when the eruption is finiſhed, if the patient dies not before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, which, from the violence of the fever, is ſometimes the caſe, the head-ach, pain in the loins, vomiting, and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, are relieved; but the fever revives its former force, or continues, and has increaſe of febrile affections every thirty-ſix hours—hence termed <hi>tertian;</hi>—at this period there ariſe want of ſleep, delirium, anxiety—there alſo come on bleeding of the noſe, copious ſweats—then heat, and dryneſs of the ſkin—very often miliary eruptions break out in ſpaces between the puſtules, or ſmall purple ſpots like flea-bit—ſometimes an eryſipclatous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:028021_0264_0FD6726DE65FAF48"/>
will occupy the head and face, and occaſion a large inflammatory ſwelling—the febrile and other ſymptoms increaſe in the ſuppurating ſtate, with toſſing and delirium—the puſtules ſubdue not, nor ſeem to be of a very bad ſort—ſometimes though they grow black and mortify—then the patients lie in a ſtate of aparent ſleep, and convulſions cloſe the ſcene.</p>
               <p>IN THE SECOND, at the commencment, there is great proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrength, lowneſs of ſpirits, obſcure febrile ſymptoms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme nauſea, ſickneſs, and oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>The puſtules never puſh forth perfectly, nor maturate kindly, but many lurk in the ſkin; and thoſe which elevate themſelves a little above it, are flat and depreſſed, containing a thin aqueous fluid, and have a ſmall black ſpot in the middle—the face, when the eruption is copious and runs together, never ſwells, but looks as if covered with a yellowiſh ſkin, ſomething like a macerated, bladder of that colour.</p>
               <p>A thin ſerous looſeneſs generally comes on—if not, convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons put a period to the unfortunate patient's exiſtence.</p>
               <p>IN THE THIRD, the ſymptoms preceding the eruptions are nearly ſimilar to the former; but the puſtules are black; the bottoms of which are in a mortified ſtate; indeed, the texture of the blood is ſo broken by the putreſcent acrimony, that it runs off by urine, and various other haemorrhages; the ſpaces between the puſtules are black, and large broad ſpots, called vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bices, or ſmall ones, like flea-bites, are formed on the ſkin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the red portion of the blood not only mixes with the ſerum, and fills the eruption, but it raiſes large bliſters elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>Theſe puſtules, which are only a little elevated, beginning to appear upon the ſecond day, are black; the urine, for the moſt part, is bloody; as are alſo the ſtools, ſpittings, vomitings, and in ſome even the tears; the fever is violent, and the febrile fits almoſt inſupportable.</p>
               <p>IN THE FOURTH, which was called DYSENTERIC, becauſe it happened in the year 1670, at the time of the epidemic dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and partook, in ſome degree, of its nature; or, becauſe the matter of the ſmall-pox was often thrown out of the conſtitution by inteſtinal evacuation, when treated by the warm regimen, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common in thoſe days.</p>
               <p>In this the eruption does not occur, as in the mild ſort, on the fourth, but on the third day; the puſtules are of a leſs ſize al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and are ſharper, or more pointed at the top, and grow blackiſh towards the concluſion—beſides, a copious diſcharge of ſaliva, as in the confluent kind, is often a concomitant. Should the acrimony of the putrid, which produces the alvine flux, that
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:028021_0265_0FD6723361F98E38"/>
forms the characteriſtic ſign of this ſpecies of ſmall-pox, be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry copious and active, occaſioning the diſcharge to be violent, it almoſt always proves mortal.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> of this, as well as of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other ſpecies of infectious or contagious fever, is a prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or peculiarity of the conſtitution to feel the impreſſions made by the morbid matter, productive of diſtreſs in the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolids, and alteration of the fluids of the machine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> contaminating particles, peculiar to the ſmall-pox, abſorbed into the habits, and theſe producing febrile effects, which vary according to the nature, or particular ſtate of the conſtitution at that time.</p>
               <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. The only certain ones are the eruptions themſelves, with their progreſſive concomitant ſymptoms, the appearance of which may be ſuſpected in the firſt ſtage, it the attack ſhould be ſudden—if the ſmall-pox ſhould be the reigning epidemic, or the patient ſo ſituated, that he has been thrown in the way of this ſpecific infection—if pain ſhould affect the back part of the head, ſauces, loins, particularly the pit of the ſtomach, attended with vomiting, and that pain increaſed on preſſure.</p>
               <p>CURE. The indications are, to diminiſh the aſſimilating or contaminating power of the morbid matter, and keep the fever within ſuch bounds, that nature ſhall be enabled to ſeparate from and throw out of the habit the offenſive materials that cauſe the diſtreſs, which is done by ſo regulating the motions of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and vaſcular ſyſtems, that the conſtitution may be put into a ſtate to mitigate and ſupport the ſucceeding conteſt with the greateſt eaſe, and freedom from danger.</p>
               <p>And this knowledge we ſhall acquire, by conſidering the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the habit, the mode of living, and ſeaſon of the year, with reſpect to the weather or conſtitution of the air, as theſe will diſpoſe more or leſs to the production of inflammatory, ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, or putreſcent febrile affections; for I am certain, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the fever, ſo are we to regulate our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and hence obſerve thoſe rules which have been previouſly laid down in the management of thoſe different fevers ſpecified in our eighth and ninth ſections.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the diſeaſe is ſo extremely mild, that there is no need of medical aſſiſtance, though at the cloſe, in order to clear the firſt paſſages from any foulneſs or offenſive matter which may have been collected there during the progreſs of the complaint, it would be right to give two or three purges. (No. 3. 19 to 24.)</p>
               <p>At others, it is of a very dangerous nature, and requires the
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:028021_0266_0FD67273F39F0AC8"/>
aſſiſtance and ſagacity of no ſmall ſhare of medical knowledge, as it is accompanied with ſuch a variety of threatening ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>
               <p>Should the ſmall-pox attack ſtrong, hale, robuſt habits, where inflammatory ſymptoms run high, which they ſometimes do to ſuch a degree, as to affect the brain, throat, or lungs, ſo as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce delirium, ſuffocation, and extreme difficulty of breathing; according to the violence of the ſymptoms we muſt have recourſe to bleeding, and that repeated, if they give not way to the firſt operation—indeed, if the pulſe is hard and full; the heat conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably above the natural ſtandard; the urine high-coloured; the pain in the head, back, and loins acute; the bleeding at the beginning ſhould be copious—and, under theſe circumſtances, blood may be taken even at the height, or any intermediate ſtage—we may alſo give antimonials, nitrous and cooling medicines, and ſuch other things as have been adviſed in cure of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fevers, (210, &amp;c.) for the ſame reaſons.</p>
               <p>If the head ſhould be violently affected, the feet may be bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in warm water, and warm fomentations, or poultices, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; for theſe will ſolicit a freer circulation downwards, a more copious eruption into the extremities, and diminiſh the quantity of variolous matter, which otherwiſe would appear in the more ſuperior parts.</p>
               <p>After once or twice bleeding, a gentle emetic, (No. 11, 12. 38.) would be uſeful, and clearing the firſt paſſages with ſome mild aperient, (No. 3. 22 to 24.) or at leaſt repeated glyſters every, or every other day, (No. 25, 26.)</p>
               <p>By the means above directed, we reduce the active power of the ſyſtem, that it may not be hindered from throwing off the matter of the ſmall-pox, by the too great diſturbance and diſtreſs occaſioned by the rapidity and violence of febrile ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But ſhould the train of ſymptoms be ſuch as indicate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a <hi>nervous fever,</hi> (325.) we muſt endeavour to rouſe the vaſcular motions, and increaſe the activity of the nervous ſyſtem, in the manner we have directed in nervous fever, (216.) for, without this, there will only be a partial ſeparation of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olous matter thrown out upon the ſurface of the body; and the internal parts, ſuch as the brain, ſtomach, lungs, and bowels, be more loaded, and the fluids not perfectly free from morbid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. To obviate theſe inconveniencies, we muſt <hi>not</hi> do any thing that is likely to turn the humours upon the bowels, nor take away any blood; for theſe would weaken the ſyſtem, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in too debilitated a ſtate, and render the fluids too acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; we muſt try to invigorate the conſtitution, in order that
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:028021_0267_0FD67235AD5043F8"/>
the blood may circulate with proper freedom externally, by wine, wine-whey, volatiles, and cordials, (218.)</p>
               <p>The load, nauſea, anxiety, and oppreſſion, which are almoſt always conſtant concomitants in this ſpecies of febrile affection, might be relieved by an emetic. (247.) for the ſhock would tend in ſome degree to rouſe the ſyſtem, and promote the eruption by that means.</p>
               <p>Should the fever attendant be of the <hi>putrid kind,</hi> and betray ſymptoms of prevalent putreſcency in the humours, we muſt not have recourſe to the lancet; for bleeding would hurry the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution rapidly into all thoſe miſchiefs which ariſe from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme debilitated nervous action, and broken texture of the blood, as before explained when treating on putrid fever, (223.)—here we muſt depend upon bark, and ſuch things as were ſpecified when treating on that malady.</p>
               <p>In order to promote ſucceſs in treating this complaint, in the beſt manner we can, by procuring a ſeparation and expulſion of the morbid matter, we muſt, indiſputably, pay attention to the preciſe nature of the fever; for it is by properly regulating that from whence we can hope for perfect and laſting relief.</p>
               <p>Particular occurrences preſent themſelves frequently, which call for our attention in an eſpecial manner, added to the general plans we have ſpecifically pointed out, in which we muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to imitate nature in her operations.</p>
               <p>When inſenſible perſpiration is too much impeded by the puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules crowding ſo cloſe together, and obſtructing the pores of the ſkin, ſhe produces either a copious ſpitting, free diſcharge of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, or looſeneſs, to make up that defect, or lodges the aqueous fluid in ſome part of the cellular membrane (26.) of the hands and feet, which at that time put on dropſical appearances—hence is pointed out to us the neceſſity of ſerous evacuations.</p>
               <p>It is therefore incumbent upon us to endeavour to promote the ſlow of urine from the completion of the eruption to the turn, by the uſe of diuretics; the ſafeſt of which is aethereal ſpirits of nitre, (176.) and taking the patients now and then out of bed, and expoſing them to the cool air.</p>
               <p>Small doſes of calomel, under theſe circumſtances, have been attended with ſome ſucceſs, as they often promote a ſpitting, or increaſe the diſcharge of urine; or, ſhould we be afraid of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the humours too much to the bowels, it may be thrown into the habit in form of ointment, rubbed in above the knee, or on the inſide of the thighs.</p>
               <p>But if theſe diſcharges are defective, or ceaſe altogether, and there is no ſwelling in the extremities ſufficient to counterbalance the decreaſed or obſtructed evacuations, the ankles or wriſts muſt
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:028021_0268_0FD67277DB33A750"/>
be bliſtered, by inſinuating ſome bliſtering ointment into the ſpaces between the puſtules—and if this ſucceeds, by creating a free diſcharge, the danger which before threatened may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily prevented—if not, we ſhall have reaſon to fear a fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <p>Sometimes reſtleſſneſs will be occaſioned, and the febrile ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms increaſed, by irritation on the ſurface of the body, creating pain, as the puſtules proceed to perfect maturation and dryneſs—here opiates (151.) (No. 4, 5.) procure eaſe and ſleep, forward ſuppuration, expedite ſeparation and expulſion, by preventing internal diſturbance in the ſyſtem from the cauſes above ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But, perhaps, by their uſe the body may be rendered coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; or if ſo, at this period, from any other cauſe, gentle aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent medicines have been recommended; but glyſters, (No. 25, 26.) every day till the dryneſs of the pocks takes place, are more eligible, as from them there can be no danger of creating the ſmalleſt diſturbance in the habit, nor of determining the fluids too much to the inteſtines, ſo as to run the leaſt riſque of induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a looſeneſs; and they will alſo effectually aſſiſt in preventing an increaſe of febrile diſtreſs, which might ariſe from collections of acrimonious matters in the firſt paſſages.</p>
               <p>Sometimes after the incruſtation is perfectly formed, from the reſorption of pus, offenſive acrid matters in the firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, or the abſorption of acrimonious or foetid particles from foul linen, the ſecondary fever is apt to ariſe. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prevent which, the patient ſhould have his linen changed, be put into freſh ſheets well aired, every thing be removed from him which can be ſuppoſed to harbour offenſive matter, and a purge, (169, &amp;c.) (No. 19 to 22.) given as ſoon as the cruſt is actually formed.</p>
               <p>Though ſome conjectured, with equal if not with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that this fever ariſes from the imperfect ſeparation or expulſion of the variolous matter, and that it becomes the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nature to free the habit from what remains.</p>
               <p>However, be the caſe which it may, if it runs high, and is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with violent head-ach, great oppreſſion, and difficulty of breathing, bleeding may be neceſſary, and ſo long as the pulſe can ſupport the operation well, it may be repeated—bliſters ſhould afterwards be applied—and purgatives adminiſtered, if the pulſe does not flag—and vegetable acids ſhould be mixed with common drinks—but ſhould the ſtrength fail, we muſt have recourſe to cordials.</p>
               <p>If it goes not off by theſe means, it will, in all probability, put on the appearance of a remittent fever, and as ſuch muſt be conſidered—for the ſubduction of which, we muſt, as in caſes of
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:028021_0269_0FD67236F40FFCD8"/>
thoſe fevers before ſpecified, (252.) apply to the bark, (253) and with reſpect to the quantity to be applied, the age of the patient, and violence of the diſeaſe, muſt regulate our judgment.</p>
               <p>Some, in order to mitigate or prevent this fever, have adviſed the puſtules, as ſoon as they are fully matured, where they are of the confluent kind, to be opened as they ripen, in the order they make their appearance. I am, however, far at preſent from recommending the adoption of ſuch a plan, as I ſhould be fearful of the moſt dangerous conſequences enſuing from ſuch a practice, particularly where the fever, after the eruption, ſtill continued with any degree of force; for it is very probable that, from thence, there is not a due ſeparation of the morbid materials, and that the <hi>ſecondary fever</hi> is very often, at leaſt, <hi>an effort of nature</hi> to throw what remains out of the habit—and that by the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſkin this purpoſe might better be effected, than by its being taken off; for from ſuch attempts, there has been reaſon to believe death the conſequence. Much miſchief has accrued from applications made to gouty limbs, from the impetuoſity of the ſufferers to take off the pain ariſing from that cauſe, before the whole of the gouty matter had been depoſited; and in theſe two caſes the reaſoning is nearly ſimilar, as well as ſome others; and it is well known, that nature frequently makes pain ariſing from ſome irritating power the ſole cauſe of conſtitutional relief. I would therefore adviſe great circumſpection on the preſent point, which only can be warranted by practical certainty, not whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, though ingenious, conjecture.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the ſmall-pox will be attended with a remittent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (250, &amp;c.) verging to the inflammatory claſs; then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe muſt be treated in the ſame manner as we have delivered when treating on that fever. (210.) (See 252.)</p>
               <p>Sometimes the eruptions will put on different appearances, (265.) which from thence are called CRYSTALLINE, and be attended with a nervous fever; in this caſe therefore, we chiefly depend on bliſters and vinous cordials, with ſuch other aids as we have ſpecified in the treatment of the ſlow nervous fever. (216.) Or SANGUINE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS or BLOODY, and have for their concomitant a putrid fever; in which caſe, without ſome ſervice can be done in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not one ray of hope remains for our ſucceſs—for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we muſt depend upon bark, and ſuch other antiſeptics, (192.) as are ſuppoſed to have the moſt powerful and immediate action, the principal of which is alum, (137, &amp;c.) (No. 56.) and purſue the mode of management throughout, as recommended in the putrid fever. (223.)</p>
               <p>Or, they are attended with extreme pain, and violent flux from the bowels, putting on the appearance of dyſentery, (268.)
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:028021_0270_0FD67278F0D603A0"/>
—in this caſe we muſt endeavour to retard the flux, by ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cordial antacids, of the ſhell or earthy kind, (19<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.) called ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbents, (No. 42, 43.) or the white decoction, with red port or claret, or aſtringent draughts. (No. 75, 76.)</p>
               <p>But in this complaint much nicety is required—for alvine fluxes are not always to be conſidered morbid, they are ſometimes critical, and the means of which nature makes uſe to carry mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid virus out of the habit—if, therefore, the pulſe does not ſink, but continues to move with ſtrength and greater freedom, and the oppreſſive ſymptoms are all alleviated, the uſe of aſtringents ſhould be cautiouſly adminiſtered. It would be more adviſable, to ſupport the patient by mild cordials, and exhibit ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as would ſheath the bowels, and ſuffer the matter to paſs through them with the leaſt uneaſineſs—ſmall doſes of ipecacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anha (No. 57.) will be beneficial, and preparations from the claſs of the demulcents, as mixtures of gum tragaoanth, Arabic, ſtarch, and ſuch like; and, towards the concluſion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, joined with ſome of the mild aſtringents, might be uſed. (No. 77, 78.)</p>
               <p>With regard to the diet, it is always to be adapted to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fever, during its continuance, which may be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what has been ſaid on this head, when treating of the inflammatory, nervous, and putrid fevers. The apartments muſt be kept cool, and the patients fit up ſome hours every day, if the circumſtances of their caſe will permit—and after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint has finiſhed its courſe, purgatives ſhould, at proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, be repeated, to clear the habit of any remains of morbid particles; and the ſame courſe purſued for the recovery of the ſtrength, as after the concluſion of other fevers, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has been much harraſſed.</p>
               <p>Long experience have enabled practitioners to make the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervations reſpecting the good and bad omens in this diſeaſe:</p>
               <p>The <hi>later the ſmall-pox make their appearance in winter</hi> the leſs dangerous they will be—they are alſo <hi>more mild in the young ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject than the ſtrong adult</hi>—the <hi>longer the firſt,</hi> or <hi>febrile ſtage,</hi> continues before the eruption, ſo much more mild; <hi>the ſhorter,</hi> ſo much the more violent may we expect the diſeaſe to be—ſhould there be <hi>an acute pain in the ſide,</hi> or <hi>in the upper orifice of the ſtomach,</hi> they are bad ſigns—the <hi>more the puſtules crowd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the more numerous they are in the face and trunk of the body; the more flat or depreſſed, the ſlighter the remiſſion in the ſecond, or eruptive ſtage,</hi> ſo much greater will be the danger—a <hi>delirium ſucceeding the eruption</hi> imports no little miſchief—<hi>deficiency of the ſalivary diſcharge,</hi> in the depreſſed or confluent ſort, is one of the worſt ſymptoms—the <hi>more florid the ſpaces between the puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules

               <p>If the <hi>matter in the puſtules be white, viſcid, and full,</hi> it is a fortunate appearance; but if, on the contrary, it ſhould be <hi>brown and thin, and the puſtules grow yellow, or have their tops indented,</hi> it is the reverſe—if the <hi>ſpaces between the puſtules, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> are livid, death is at hand.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a bad omen <hi>if the ſecondary fever appears before the retroceſſion of the puſtules—if the face ſubſides, and the ſalivation or ſpitting ceaſes, and the hands and arms ſwell not in the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the confluent ſort, it is a ſign of death.</p>
               <p>If, on account of being too heated, <hi>the patient cannot bear the bed-cloaths upon him,</hi> it portends a delirium—<hi>great inflammation of the ſauces, quickneſs in breathing, clear urine, with little cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs floating in it, grinding of the teeth, picking of the flocks from the bed cloaths,</hi> threaten diſſolution—nor are we to build any hopes on the remiſſion of delirium, <hi>if the fever continues in the ſame ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we cloſe this part of our ſubject, we muſt beg leave to make one general obſervation reſpecting all eruptive fevers, as well as the ſmall-pox—that as many, though their eruptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the conſequence of their peculiar action on the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and produce ſpecific cuticular appearances, are uſhered in by ſome fever, either of the inflammatory, nervous, or putrid kind, in general; yet, ſhould they he attended, as ſometimes they are, with thoſe of the mixed claſs, where we cannot perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh to which of the more ſimple ſort they belong, we muſt treat them according to the ideas given in the mixed fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.

               <p>It is rather ſingular, that after ſo many years experience of the advantages accruing from inoculation, that there remain any ſo blinded to their own intereſt and happineſs, as to be deſirous ſtill of abrogating the practice—which is the preſerver of life, beauty, and health, ſo perfectly clear to common obſervation.</p>
               <p>The mere recital of the benefits annexed to it are ſo conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that reaſoning is unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>It ſupplies us with the opportunity of having the body pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly prepared for the reception of the morbid matter; ſo that it may be freed from ſuch materials as would ſupply an active cauſe to increaſe and prolong febrile affections; and thus prevent the fever, which always attends in the ſmall-pox, from running too high, or producing otherwiſe dangerous effects, according
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:028021_0272_0FD6727AAAEBDE88"/>
to the nature of the conſtitution—it occaſions a ſmaller quantity of eruptions, and the puſtules to be more ſuperficial—hence not leaving thoſe deep pit., and often unſeemly ſcars as in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſmall-pox—it ſupplies us with a knowledge of the diſeaſe at the firſt onſet, and enables us to provide againſt its conſequences—it empowers us to throw in the matter into the conſtitution from places far diſtant from the vital parts, and prevents the lungs being primarily affected—and, what is of great conſequence, it enables patients to eſcape the ſecondary fever, ſo fatal to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for in this artificial ſort it rarely attends—add to this, the operation is ſo extremely trifling, that it is performed almoſt without the ſlighteſt pain, in the following manner:</p>
               <p>The ſcarf-ſkin, of one or both arms, is elevated by a lancet, upon which ſome of the infectious matter, taken from a patient labouring under the ſmall-pox, remains, then preſſing the ſcarf-ſkin upon the lancet, and with drawing it from under that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the variolous matter is left upon the true ſkin, and taken into the habit by the abſorbent inhaling veſſels, which open up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its ſurface.</p>
               <p>Subjects of every age may be inoculated, even ſuch as are at the breaſt; by ſome eſteemed the beſt time of life; but it ſhould be before they begin to cut their teeth—certainly their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are at that time in the moſt proper ſtate—and, could we be aſſured that no accident would occur that might need the aid of medicine, there could not be a moment's heſitation reſpecting the preference; but, on this account, I ſhall rather recommend ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating at two years old, when complaints could not ariſe from teething when the conſtitution was not in ſo irritable a ſtate as to be inconvenienced by ſlight cauſes—and, in caſes of neceſſity, ſhould they ariſe, the application of medicines would be leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.</p>
               <p>With regard to the ſeaſon, practitioners have differed in that point—the hot months in ſummer I conſider as the moſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, and give the preference to thoſe which are the moſt temperate—the ſpring, or latter part of autumn, taking care, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe periods, to avoid performing the operation when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory or putrid fevers or other acute complaints were epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, for very obvious reaſons.</p>
               <p>The modes of preparation ſhould be adapted to the conſtitution of the patient.</p>
               <p>Generally living cool and temperate for three weeks, feeding on aceſcent food, with now and then a gentle mercurial purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for thoſe of healthful habits, will in common be ſufficient—but thoſe of puny conſtitutions, whoſe ſyſtem is relaxed, ſhould live more freely, and be allowed animal food once every day, of
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:028021_0273_0FD6724030B3AAA8"/>
the light and eaſily digeſtible kind, and in moderate quantity, mixed with aceſcent vegetables.</p>
               <p>In fine, preſerving the conſtitution in a moderate degree of ſtrength, clearing the firſt paſſages, removing glandular obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, making that ſyſtem act with freedom, and loading the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, as much as may be, with aceſcent fluids, ſeems the moſt rational mode of putting the body into the beſt ſtate.</p>
               <p>By theſe means, the nervous and vaſcular ſyſtem will be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to perform their functions properly, and the humours not become prone to run into an acrimonious or putreſcent ſtate—hence nature will not meet with any impediment to prevent her from ſeparating and throwing out the offenſive matter, after it has produced its effects on the maſs of circulating fluids.</p>
               <p>It has been thought, and I am of opinion, rightly, that it is immaterial from what ſort of ſmall-pox the inoculating matter is taken, as the different kinds produced depend not upon the nature of the morbid particles, but the conſtitution into which it is thrown—for there will be a bad ſort ariſe from matter that has every mark of mildneſs, and a good ſort from ſuch as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more of a malignant nature; nay, indeed, different people inoculated with the ſame matter taken from the ſame puſtule, have been known, and that commonly, to have different ſorts of the ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>However, I would always adviſe it to be taken from ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as labour under the diſeaſe in its mildeſt ſtate, and have the moſt favourable appearing pus—for it is our buſineſs to take mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from thoſe conſtitutions which, by the appearance of the pocks, beſpeak the greateſt purity, and freedom from any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid taint—for all people are not agreed upon what the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this complaint depends; and many conclude that other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders may be inoculated with the ſmall-pox—theſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, furniſh arguments ſufficient for great cautions in our elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. After the punctures are made in the arms, on the ſecond day, if the parts are examined by a good magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glaſs, there appears commonly about the puncture an orange-coloured ſtain, whilſt the ſkin around it ſeems to contract; but ſometimes an inflammation takes place on the ſecond day, then diſappears totally—this, though, may ariſe from irritation from the puncture, trifling as it is; we remain, therefore, doubtful whether or not infection has taken place—but if it has ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the fourth or fifth day from the operation, a hardneſs and itching, with an apparent inflammation of the part, is percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and a kind of bliſter, filled with a tranſparent liquid, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="unknown:028021_0274_0FD6727FB0940130"/>
On the ſixth day, a pain and ſtiffneſs affects the arm-pits.</p>
               <p>On the ſeventh, but <hi>more frequently</hi> upon the eighth, ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which precede the eruption make their appearance; and theſe are commonly ſuch as ſhew themſelves in general at the commencement of fevers—cold chills and heat alternate with each other, a ſlight degree of languor, heavineſs of the eyes, and ſlight pains in the head and back, are, now and then, perceptible; and theſe remain pretty conſtant till the ſmall-pox manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The inflammation now begins to ſpread very faſt, and, round the punctured part, a great number of ſmall eruptions may be ſeen crowding together, which increaſe during the courſe of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Surrounding the inciſion, and extending itſelf half way round the arm, but more commonly deſcribing the breadth of a ſhilling, a circular, or oval, effloreſcence is obſervable. The larger this inflammatory appearance is, which is ſmooth to the touch, and not painful, the fewer are the general puſtular eruptions—and, indeed, I have obſerved, when the thread was made uſe of, this was the caſe, if the diſcharge from the inciſion was very copious—now all the ſymptoms ceaſe, and the buſineſs ſeems to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly finiſhed.</p>
               <p>UNFAVOURABLE SYMPTOMS. Though this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the diſeaſe in general, yet it ſometimes happens that there are deviations, and that we have not inflammatory appearances on the wounded arm till the eighth day, then it will ſuddenly ſhew itſelf, with the other concomitant ſymptoms—this is not recorded as a favourable omen—ſtill it ſometimes is in this point deceptive.</p>
               <p>But if the colour around the puncture continues pale, though it is barely perceptible that inoculation has ſucceeded, inſtead of becoming red or inflamed—if the edges of the wound ſpread but little, and remain flat, unattended with itching, or any kind of uneaſineſs—if, inſtead of a red inflammation about the inciſion, it ſhould have a purpliſh caſt; if red, and the circle round the puncture ſhould be narrow and deep, and the incruſtation around it ſhould be depreſſed and concave in the center, they are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered us unfavourable ſigns.</p>
               <p>FAVOURABLE SIGNS. On the other hand, if on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day there ſhould be an orange-coloured ſtain round the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion—an itching there in two or three days—a kind of eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſcarf-ſkin, reſembling a bliſter, without much inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, on the third or fourth day—a pain or ſtiffneſs in the pit of the arm, a large effloreſcence round the puncture, on the tenth or eleventh day, or ſooner—a hardneſs ſpreading circularly from
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:028021_0275_0FD67242833B1278"/>
the puncture, the inflamed part of the arm elevating itſelf, and forming a point, terminating in a dry ſeal; theſe are ſaid to form very pleaſing prognoſtics, and flatter us with the moſt agreeable expectations of a happy concluſion.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. Theſe are ſimilar to what we have before recited in the ſmall-pox—for if the conſtitution is not poſſeſſed of the prediſpoſing cauſe, no effect will be produced, though the vario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matter ſhould be thrown into the habit.</p>
               <p>CURE. In the evening after the puncture is made, it hath been thought adviſeable to give a few grains of the calomel pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as much as will procure two or three evacuations, purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it off in the morning with ſome gentle cathartic. (No. 79, 80.)</p>
               <p>Or, inſtead of the laſt, a doſe of Glauber's or Polychreſt ſalt, proportioned to the age and conſtiution of the patient—theſe are adviſed to be given every ſecond morning and evening, till the appearance of the eruption. This is ſuperfluous, two doſes will be in all common caſes ſufficient, immediately after the operation, and a day or two before the attack. If the inflammation is ſlight at the puncture, the doſe of calomel muſt be increaſed.</p>
               <p>Afterwards we have nothing to do but to guard againſt the febrile ſymptoms, which are in general ſo mild, that there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle occaſion for medicine.</p>
               <p>At the commencement, if neceſſary, what has been juſt above preſcribed are adviſed; and repeated two or three times, if the diſeaſe appears to be of a late or unfavourable ſort.</p>
               <p>In the intermediate days, ſhould the fever run high, Clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's febrifuge ſpirit, or the aethereal ſpirit of vitriol dropt into any aqueous fluid, ſo as to make it agreeable, may be taken of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the day.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the ſymptoms of the eruptive fever come on, the patients ſhould continue to be expoſed to the cool air as much as poſſible; for it is the beſt cordial and corrector of febrile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this caſe, as I have repeatedly experienced. Indeed, when the febrile ſymptoms appear to be violent at the onſet, great good has occured from the adminiſtration of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonial emetic and purgative.</p>
               <p>Where the fever appears to be languid, and the patients are of weak and delicate conſtitutions, ſome caution is here neceſſary; for theſe, perhaps, it will be ſufficient to be kept in a large well ventilated room, eſpecially if the weather ſhould be very cold; and they ſhould be ſupported on ſomething of a more cordial and ſtimulating, nature, than if things were otherwiſe, and the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents more robuſt, who ſhould be kept, during the eruption, on a mere aceſcent diet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="unknown:028021_0276_0FD672846C4C39A8"/>
After the eruptive ſtate is over, and the puſtules begin to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turate, ſmall broths, jellies, white wine whey, or ſuch like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, may be allowed.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of the diſeaſe, the weakly and more delicate may require to be kept in bed, and ſupplied with more cordial appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, in order to perfect the ſuppuration of the puſtules, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally free the conſtitution from any remains of the variolous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>If we proceed in this prudent manner, adapting our mode to the particular conſtitution of our patient, we ſhall very ſeldom have much trouble; but ſhould there ariſe uncommon complaints now and then in the inoculated ſmall-pox, it will be neceſſary for us to proceed as directed in the natural diſeaſe, (265, &amp;c.) obſerving whether it verges to the nature of inflammatory ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, putrid, or mixed fever, and conduct ourſelves conſiſtent with what the ſymptoms point out to our judgement.</p>

According to my conception, it is in general a febrile diſeaſe of the inflammatory kind, always infectious, electively affecting that membrane, called ſcheiderian, which lines the inſide of the noſe, throat, and lungs, and, in its progreſſion, the ſkin—though I have ſeen the affection of the lungs ſo extremely ſlight, as not to call forth the leaſt attention, where there was a diarrhoea at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. Its progreſs is divided into three ſtages—the <hi>firſt</hi> precedes, the <hi>ſecond</hi> attends, and <hi>the laſt</hi> ſucceeds the completion of the eruption.</p>
               <p>At the commencement there are chillneſs and heat alternately ſucceeding each other—ſoon after, on the ſecond day, the fever increaſes, attended with conſiderable ſickneſs, great heat, thirſt, languor, and loſs of appetite—the tongue is white—there is a heavineſs of the head, and drowſineſs—ſneezing—brightneſs of the eyes, from whence flow a thin humour—the eye-lids ſwell, and, <hi>moſt commonly,</hi> there is a dry and very troubleſome cough—ſometimes vomiting and looſeneſs are aſſociates with theſe, the laſt of a green colour, when children are getting their teeth—and all theſe ſymptoms gradually increaſe till the ERUPTIVE, or SECONDARY STAGE begins, which occurs generally on the fourth day; about which time ſmall red ſpots, like flea-bites, make their appearance in the face, which run into cluſters, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing larger ſpots, riſing above the ſkin, perceptible only to the touch, not the ſight; afterwards broad ſpots ſpread over the body downwards; not quite ſo prominent, though of a higher colour than thoſe of the face—when the eruption is finiſhed, the vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceaſes, but the fever increaſes; and the cough, with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing, become more violent—a ſweat and diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoea now and then ſupervene.</p>
               <p>On the ſixth day, or thereabout, the THIRD STAGE commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, on which the ſpots on the face grow dry, and give it a rough appearance; and in three days more they totally diſappear from the whole body; for on the ninth day nothing is to be ſeen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a dark coloured fine farina, or appearance like bran all over the ſurface of the ſkin—at this period, the fever and cough are ſometimes alleviated; ſometimes increaſed, and terminate in a dangerous peripneumony—and not unfrequently a looſeneſs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>After this we are not to conclude the patient free from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, unleſs, during its courſe, ſome conſiderable evacuation has taken place, either by ſweating, vomiting, urine, or looſeneſs; for without ſomething of this kind occurs, the cough will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, the fever will return with additional violence, and the
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:028021_0278_0FD67285C6DAD648"/>
ſtrength not be recovered except with great commotion in the ſyſtem, and, conſequently, extreme danger.</p>
               <p>Though what we have deſcribed is the moſt frequent mode of the meazles appearance and progreſs to their termination, yet ſometimes they differ ſo much, that authors have denominated them ANOMALOUS, or IRREGULAR, as deviating from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe, or as in the eruption putting on the appearance of the ſmall-pox—both which we ſhall deſcribe before we proceed to the cure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>anomalous</hi> differ from the mild ſort, becauſe the eruption happens not on the fourth day, but ſometimes before, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times after—the ſymptoms preceding, as well as accompanying the eruption, are more ſevere—the eruption does not begin ſo much on the face as on the ſhoulders and trunk of the body—and becauſe it is attended by more dangerous conſequences.</p>
               <p>Beſides the ſymptoms which are common in ſevere fevers, there are ſome which are more peculiar to eruptive ones of this ſort; for here the pulſe is ſmall and frequent—reſpiration is ſhort and quick—there is an oppreſſion of the hypochondres—(33. 38.)—the urine pale—a great drowſineſs—twitching of the tendons—ſpaſms—delirium, with redneſs and watery appearance of the eyes—load on the eye-lids—and pricking pain in the ſkin—ſoreneſs of the throat comes on, with a ſhrill hoarſeneſs, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent cough, in which children appear almoſt ſuffocated, vomit up their food, and grow black in the face—when, after ſo ſevere a ſtruggle, the eruption appears, the fever in part depoſits its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, the diſeaſe is at its height; and the fever perſiſts in the ſame manner to the drying of the ſpots, which yet, according to SYDENHAM, did not ſeem to put on that branny appearance as before deſcribed.</p>
               <p>The event of this fever is often dreadful and deadly; for, on the eruption receding, the fever and difficulty of breathing are augmented—a peripneumony and diarrhoea, occaſioned by the ſtriking in of meazly particles, comes on; which laſt is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, as happens often in the milder ſort, becauſe <hi>here</hi> it is acrid, dyſenteric, and excruciating—ſometimes a cough, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing, and hectic fever ſucceed—at other times, a general dropſy, but oftener obſtinate inflammatory affections of the eyes.</p>
               <p>The OTHER is ſaid to be common at PARIS, wherein the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is different from that of the common regular meazles; for they are more prominent, ſuppurate perceptibly like the ſmall-pox, and occaſion the face to ſwell conſiderably; but then they are attended with the cough, watery eye, and other affections,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:028021_0279_0FD67244067843E8"/>
ariſing from defluxions, which chiefly diſtinguiſh them from the ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>CAUSES, whether inducing or proximate, are ſimilar to thoſe of the ſmall-pox, (269.) the peculiar particles only creative of the diſeaſe being altered.</p>
               <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. An infections inflammatory fever for the moſt part, with which are aſſociated, a defluxion of a thin watery humour from the eyes, tickling in the noſe, ſneez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dry cough, more or leſs violent—on the fourth day, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſooner, ſometimes later though rarely, ſmall ſpots running together, perceptible to the touch on the face, but broader on the body not perceptibly elevated above the ſkin, break forth, which in three days after are converted into branny ſcales in part, and totally diſappear upon the ninth day.</p>
               <p>CURE. In ſo mild a manner will the meaſles ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect patients, that little is neceſſary to be done, except abſtinence from all animal food, or heating applications; and drinking free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thin watery aceſcent liquids, ſuch as common fig drink, made agreeably acid with lemon-juice, apple water, or ſome ſuch like fluids.</p>
               <p>But ſhould the febrile ſymptoms run high, we muſt proceed as directed in the ſmall-pox, (26.)—but great attention muſt be paid to the affection of the lungs—oily emulſions and linctures, (No. 81 to 83.) may therefore be preſcribed occaſionally, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the other remedies, calculated to keep the febrile affections within proper limits.</p>
               <p>Should oily medicines diſagree with the ſtomach, as is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the caſe, we muſt have recourſe to the claſs of demulcents, (187.) (No. 84) uſing the pectoral decoction, or that of linſeed as common drink.</p>
               <p>After the eruption is completed, ſlight opiates are ſerviceable—but as nature generally performs her criſis either by ſweats, looſeneſs, or urine, we muſt obſerve what way ſhe directs her ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and proceed as we have before directed in cures of this kind, where they occur in fevers not eruptive.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the redneſs of the ſkin goes off, and the ſpots begin to die away, gentle purgatives muſt be adminiſtered, at proper intervals, and the patient return to his uſual mode of life gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, (209.)—care alſo ſhould be taken, that patients expoſe not themſelves too early to the cold air, for theſe are apt to bring on a very diſagreeable cough, aſthma, and conſumption, from affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the lungs, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Should a <hi>delirium</hi> come on the fourth day, wherein the pulſe is ſmall, it is an unfavourable omen; ſtill by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of leeches to the temples, it may be mitigated or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a bad ſign if <hi>the fever ſhould increaſe and become vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> accompanied with intenſe thirſt, about the termination of the diſeaſe—and ſhould there appear <hi>great danger of ſuffocation,</hi> as will ſometimes happen from too great an afflux of ſerous humours on the lungs on the ninth day, we muſt fly to bleeding, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtrength of the patient, and apply bliſters, to prevent an inflammation coming on from that cauſe—which, if it cannot be done, ſuffocation may be the immediate conſequence—or, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping that abſceſs will probably ſucceed, a hectic fever and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
               <p>A <hi>diarrhoea,</hi> or <hi>dyſentery,</hi> is apt to come after vomitings of green materials; and continue, though the meazles have finiſhed their courſe—theſe complaints yield only to bleeding.</p>
               <p>The meazles which put on the appearance of the ſmall-pox, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſame mode of treatment as the mild ſort.</p>
               <p>But in caſes of the anamolous ſpecies, we muſt be directed by the nature of the fever, and proceed in our modes of cure, as pointed out in our treatment of the different kinds of the ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>A moderate looſeneſs, with a ſoftneſs and gentle moiſture of the ſkin, alleviate all the febrile ſymptoms—but the flower the eruption, ſo much greater will be the danger—of which alſo we may have ſtrong ſuſpicion if they make their appearance on the ſecond, or the fifth and ſixth day from the attack—if they ſhould retrocede, and be aſſociated with delirium, or become livid, the worſt is to be dreaded—too high a degree of redneſs or paleneſs of the puſtules, great proſtration of ſtrength, vomiting, great reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, difficulty of ſwallowing; or other ſpots, purple-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like flea-bites, are alſo dangerous appearances—the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of all which will flatter us with moſt pleaſing expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Few people have thought the meazles to be a diſeaſe of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient conſequence, to avail themſelves of thoſe aſſiſtances which, as in the ſmall-pox, might be derived from inoculation in this complaint. As for my own part, practically I cannot ſay any thing on the ſubject; but if we may believe the authority of ſome who have made the experiment, or be allowed to depend on reaſoning from analogy, our labours might be happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded—for it is aſſerted, and appears probable, that from ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation from infected blood, on the ſixth day a ſlight fever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts itſelf moſt commonly, though it is very moderate, unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

with loſs of ſleep and inflammatory ſymptoms; and it is neither ſucceeded by a hectic fever, cough, nor inflamed eyes; ſo that we find we ſhould be freed from a train of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſymptoms, and conſequently relieved, in many caſes, from the moſt diſtreſſing apprehenſions.</p>

               <p>DESCRIPTION. This is a diſeaſe which attacks children about two or three years old, without any remarkable febrile ſymptom or indiſpoſition; it chiefly appears on the face, in ſmall red puſtules full of a clear or whitiſh watery fluid, about the ſize of a lentile; ſome of which dry off in two days, whilſt others increaſe; and all fall off in a dry ſtate within the ſpace of four, generally leaving no pits in the ſkin, as they are commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no inconvenience.</p>

               <p>Having had in the courſe of practice ſo little opportunity of attending the complaint throughout, and when called, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo little to be done, I confeſs it ſcarce ever awakened my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, as nature, after the ſtomach and bowels were cleared, if ſuch attempts appeared neceſſary, always performed the cure. I am happy to have it in my power to ſupply my readers with an account drawn by the pen of ſo accurate an obſerver as Dr. HEBERDEN, who ſays, in enumerating the</p>
               <p>SYMPTOMS, that the pocks in many break out without any previous ſigns or illneſs; in others they are preceded by a ſlight degree of chillneſs, laſſitude, cough, broken ſleep, wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains, loſs of appetite, and feveriſh for three days—the puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules in moſt of them are the common ſize of ſmall-pox; but ſome are leſs—they are never confluent or numerous.</p>
               <p>On the firſt day of the eruption they are reddiſh—on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond there is at the top of moſt of the puſtules a very ſmall bladder, about the ſize of a millet-ſeed; this is ſometimes full
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:028021_0282_0FD67191F6A38898"/>
of a watery and colourleſs liquor, ſometimes it is yellowiſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between the cuticle and ſkin—on the ſecond, or at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, on the third day from the beginning of the eruption, is many of theſe pocks as are not ruptured ſeem arrived at their full maturity, and thoſe which are fulleſt of that yellow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor very much reſemble what the genuine ſmall-pox are on the fifth day.</p>
               <p>A thin ſcab is formed at the top of the puſtule from the cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle being burſt, on the firſt or ſecond day, which contains this thin fluid, by accident, or, perhaps, from rubbing to allay the itching; the ſwelling of the other parts abates without its being ever turned into pus—thoſe which eſcape being burſt, have the little liquor turn yellow and thick, and dries into a ſcab—on the fifth day of the eruption they are almoſt all dried and covered with a cruſt.</p>
               <p>The patients ſuffer little, except ſome languor of ſpirits, ſtrength, and appetite.</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe wants no remedies.</p>
               <p>It is diſtinguiſhable from the ſmall-pox by the appearance on the ſecond or third day, from the eruption full of ſerum upon the top of the pock.</p>
               <p>From the cruſt alſo, which covers the pock upon the fifth day, at which time the ſmall-pox is not at the height of its ſuppuration.</p>
               <p>But of this diſorder there appears a more malignant ſort.</p>
               <p>For three or four days all the ſymptoms which precede the eruption run much higher—on the fourth or fifth day the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears, with very little abatement of the fever—the pains, likewiſe, of the limbs and back continue—to which are joined pains of the gums—the pocks are redder than the common chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enpox, ſpread wider, and hardly riſe ſo high, at leaſt not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their ſize—inſtead of one little head, or vecſile of a ſerous matter, there have been from four to twelve—they go off juſt like the chicken-pox, and are diſtinguiſhable from the ſmall-pox by the ſame marks.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the continuance of the pains and fever after the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the degree of both theſe, though there be not above twenty pocks, are not obſervable in the ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>From the ſimilarity of the chicken, or ſwine, and ſmall-pox, we may be able to account for the tales we have had of people being affected with the ſmall-pox twice, or having them after being inoculated, and ſucceeding—for ſome may have been ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated from the chicken, inſtead of the ſmall-pox—and this is one of the ſtrongeſt reaſons that has induced me to inſert this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the error may be avoided—as very little is neceſſary in this caſe to be done by medicine more than what has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

recited—taking care, that if the febrile ſymptoms run high, to treat it in the ſame manner as the ſmall-pox under ſimilar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>It is alſo worthy of obſervation, that thoſe who have had the ſmall-pox may have the chicken-pox; but thoſe who have had the chicken-pox cannot be infected again by it; though, to ſuch as never had the diſtemper, it is as infectious as the ſmall-pox.</p>

               <p>This fever is inflammatory, and attended with different kinds of eruptions; whence it has been divided into two ſpecies—one called SIMPLE SCARLET FEVER—the other, SCARLET NETTLE RASH FEVER, from its eruptions being ſimilar in appearance to thoſe marks left by the ſtinging of nettles.</p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. At the commencement the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms attend which we find in continued fevers, among which there is no great degree of ſickneſs; but on the fourth day the face ſwells, the eruption manifeſts itſelf externally, which are red, more copious, broader, and of a much more florid colour, but not at the ſame time ſo uniform as thoſe which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the meazles; but they ariſe without any cough or watery eye, which diſtinguiſhes them from the meazles; they appear and recede two or three times during the diſeaſe; beſides, the redneſs ſhews itſelf to be uniform, as if the ſkin was ſuffuſed with red wine, not breaking in cluſters of puſtules upon the breaſt as the meazles do—in three or four days it entirely ceaſes—the ſcarf-ſkin ſoon after peels off, and there continues on the ſurface of the body fine bran-like ſcales, which are ſucceſſively ſupplied for two or three times.</p>
               <p>Sometimes eruptions break out on the face and reſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy like the ſtinging of nettles, with much itching, which are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above the ſkin, ſoon increaſe, of a pale roſe colour; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with protuberances almoſt eryſipelatous, and roughneſs like te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ters—ſometimes, on the fever remitting, they diſappear; but about the evening ſhew themſelves, with fever, and a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome hot itching—and, in three or four days, like the former, entirely ceaſe, when extremely ſmall ſcales ſeparate from the ſkin.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The ſame may be advanced here as in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles. (283.)</p>
               <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. This is an infectious inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory or remittent fever, of ſhort duration, with a ſwelling of the face on the fourth day, attended with a florid redneſs all over
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:028021_0284_0FD671AF545AE448"/>
the ſkin, with broad ſpots, running at laſt together, not elevated above the ſkin; or with ſpots like the ſtinging of nettles, which in three, four, or five days diſappear, occaſioning the ſcarf-ſkin to peel off, and covering the ſurface of the body with fine bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcales.</p>
               <p>CURE. This is of the moſt ſimple nature—abſtinence from animal food, keeping out of the cold air, free uſe of watery li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids, thin gruels, and moderate warmth whilſt in bed; but ſhould the ſymptoms run very high, and the pulſe be very quick, full, and ſtrong, bleeding may be neceſſary, once, perhaps, and the uſe of ſaline mixture, (No. 1.) or ſmall doſes of antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, (180.) or nitrous powders, (No. 2.) keeping the body gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open, by the uſe of the mildeſt aperients, if coſtive, (171, 172.) (No. 3. 22 to 24.) and, after the whole is over, and the ſcarf-ſkin begins to peel off, two or three doſes of gentle phyſic ſhould be given. (172.) (No. 19 to 22.)</p>
               <p>But ſometimes convulſions, or great drowſineſs may come on in the beginning, particularly with infants, a large bliſter may be applied between the ſhoulders, and a quieting draught, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to No. 4, given every night, agreeable to the age and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the patient—uſing, for common drink, milk and water, balm tea, in which may be diſſolved ſome gum arabic, and ſmall portions of nitre.</p>
               <p>Doubts have ariſen about the exiſtence of this fever, Dr. CUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEN having never ſeen it in its ſimple ſtate—however, it certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does exiſt, and as deſcribed by SYDENHAM, of which repeated experience has convinced me; nay, indeed, I have known it ſeize ſeveral children in the ſame family, and moſt generally at the end of ſummer.</p>
               <p>There is another ſpecies arranged here by ſome authors, ſtiled the MALIGNANT SCARLET FEVER—but of that we ſhall take the opportunity of ſpeaking under the head of Sore Throat, as that is one of its peculiar and diſtinguiſhing ſymptoms, and may probably be derived from that ſource.</p>

               <p>Though the exiſtence of this fever has been doubted by many, ſtill, it is generally now allowed, that there is a fever of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kind, originating from ſpecific infectious particles getting

               <p>The patient ſoon after, on the ſecond day, begins to be fearful and apprehenſive, <hi>conſtantly ſighing, from a ſenſe of weight and tightneſs at the pit of the ſtomach</hi>—has uneaſy dreams—<hi>dejection of ſpirits—the head confuſed</hi>—his ſweats perpetually ſmell ſour—there are a variety of ſudden and involuntary motions, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſtleſſneſs</hi>—the pulſe is <hi>ſmaller,</hi> and increaſed in <hi>quickneſs</hi>—and there is a certain ſenſation of tingling numbneſs in the fingers—and the urine pale and limpid.</p>
               <p>On the third or fourth day, ſeldom later, red or white erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions break out on the neck, breaſt, and back, ſeldom on the face, preceded by pricking pains, ſometimes itching—at this period chillneſs and heat ſucceed each other repeatedly, and the ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becomes profuſe—from thence, for about the ſpace of thirty hours, eruptions continue to come out, which are filled with a thin ſerous fluid, having round their baſe an inflammatory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The ſymptoms now begin to be alleviated—the ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continues, though not ſo profuſely—the mind begins to be leſs oppreſſed—the urine puts on a higher colour—the pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more ſoft and regular—and about the ſeventh day the puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules for the moſt part grow dry, the ſcarf-ſkin peeling off in ſcales.</p>
               <p>This is a pretty accurate deſcription of the mild ſpecies of this fever, in which we may expect the eruptions will very ſoon make their appearance, when there are an uncommon dejection of ſpirits, watchings, confuſion of the head, much oppreſſion on the breaſt, with a weak quick pulſe; for theſe are conſidered as the certain ſymptoms of their near approach.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. Both the inducing and immediate are ſimilar to what we have delivered when ſpeaking of the meazles. (283.)</p>
               <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A mixed fever, attended with anxiety—dejection of ſpirits—frequent involuntary ſighing—ſtrong ſmelling ſweats—and pricking of the ſkin—ſmall diſtinct
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:028021_0286_0FD67193BB767150"/>
ſpots, for the moſt part of a red colour, breaking out moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on the third or fourth day on the neck, breaſt, and back, ſeldom on the face, whoſe tops reſemble, after one or two days, very minute puſtules, which continue only for a ſhort ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>CURE. The indications of cure are the ſame as in other erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fevers.</p>
               <p>Now this fever muſt in this place be conſidered of a mixed nature, (240.) verging rather more to the nervous than inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory claſs—however, if they attack thoſe of ſtrong, robuſt, full habits, and there ſhould be a great degree of vaſcular action, bleeding may, perhaps, be neceſſary, but that rarely—we ſhould rather proceed as we have directed when ſpeaking of the ſimple continued fever, to the uſe of ſaline mixtures, with ſmall doſes of antimonials, (181.) (No. 6 to 9.) from whence, if the ſtomach ſhould be ſoul, a vomiting will enſue; this will abate the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, take off the oppreſſion, produce a gentle perſpiration, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the morbid matter to the ſkin, moderate the febrile ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and occaſion, though not a leſs copious, a more expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eruption—and before <hi>that,</hi> cooling purgatives are beneficial, though not afterwards. (171, 172.) (No. 3. 22 to 24.)</p>
               <p>Bleeding, it muſt be obſerved, is only admiſſible in <hi>the firſt ſtage</hi> of this diſeaſe—afterwards it is ſo far from being of any uſe, that convulſions and death itſelf are often the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>Cooling acids may be alſo allowed in the beginning; but when the eruption has appeared they are prejudicial—diluting, emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient, and aceſcent liquids may be uſed—and from fomenting the feet and legs with tepid fomentations, great advantages have been derived.</p>
               <p>But ſhould the conſtitution be different from what we have ſpecified, that is, rather debilitated than languid, and the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſyſtem appear to be in too inactive a ſtate, we muſt apply to ſuch things as are of more cordial nature, to ſupport and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate the conſtitution; but out of them we muſt ſelect thoſe of the milder ſpecies; for, by ſtimulating the habit too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhould prevent the ſeparation and expulſion of the morbid matter, and be inſtrumental in occaſioning it to fall upon ſome of the nobler parts internally.</p>
               <p>Hence, then, ſuch cordial volatile medicines as we have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in the nervous fever, or ſome things ſimilar, ſhould be adminiſtered—and wine and water, or white wine whey may be allowed to be drank occaſionally.</p>
               <p>Bliſters ſhould alſo be applied; and as ſoon as one has ceaſed to diſcharge, another muſt be laid on, becauſe it is obſervable
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:028021_0287_0FD6724E110ADE88"/>
that the evacuation produced by them, as well as keeping up the ſtimulus, affords great relief; for, on the evacuation ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all things wear a more favourable aſpect, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways altered for the better, on the reproduction of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes, inſtead of the convulſive ſymptoms being mitigated after the eruption, they increaſe, attended with ſuch a train of ſymptoms as are indicative of greater degree of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>For the febrile affections grow more violent, increaſing about mid-day and at night—the ſleep is diſturbed with dreadful dreams—the ſweating decreaſes—the ſkin is hot and inflamed—the head is affected with pain, producing the ſenſation of inward diſtenſion—the face appears fuller—the tongue is dry and white—the pulſe ſmall and quick—and the urine copious, thin, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>On the third day of the eruption there appears a great aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of violence throughout—the heat is burning—the puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules ſubſide—the ſweat ceaſes—the ſkin becomes rough—the tendons ſtart—the patients are extremely reſtleſs, forward, and loquacious—they grow delirious, and are convulſed—they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thirſty—the pulſe is hard and quick—and the urine copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and like water.</p>
               <p>The belly, which before was coſtive, is now the reverſe, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating foetid bilious ſtools—ſhould any ſweat return, this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the puſtules breaking out again is mitigated—and on the ſucceeding day the eruptions become more copious and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the former beginning now to dry—notwithſtanding which, about the third day the ſecond crop creates new and ſimilar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, though in a milder degree than the former—a third and fourth crop will ſucceed, until the laſt ſtage of declenſion, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to what occurs in the milder ſpecies.—Still in this ſtate of the diſeaſe there is a bilious foetid looſeneſs, with rolling of wind in the bowels, which continues—the urine ſometimes feels hot, and appears like milk whey without any ſediment.</p>
               <p>Patients afflicted with this fever ſeldom recover before the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth or twenty-firſt day.</p>
               <p>This fever has been by ſome conſidered of the inflammatory claſs; by others it has been called the acute malignant—but it appears to be truly of the mixed kind, and might properly be looked upon as a <hi>malignant miliary mixed</hi> fever.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the progreſs of this fever is ſlower, and longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, the puſtules not ſtriking out with a proper redneſs, but ſinking down in the ſkin or retroceding inwardly, liable to return at ſome other time, and occaſioning a ſlow recovery; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:028021_0288_0FD6719589506E10"/>
death; but its progreſs is different in ſome degree.</p>
               <p>This fever is apt to ſeize the delicate and relaxed, who have a thin and acrimonious ſtate of fluids.</p>
               <p>In addition to the puſtular appearance above ſpecified, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons ſtart continually—a delirium and convulſions come on—the head-ach, though conſiderable, is not very acute—the tongue trembles—the velocity of the pulſe is not ſo great in the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtage; but the freedom and quickneſs are irregular; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it almoſt intermits—the urine is various, ſometimes thin or higher coloured, but oftener turbid and ſmall in quantity—but a viſcid ſweat breaking out which is foetid, having for its aſſociate ſome larger veſicular eruptions, and puſtules of ſize more conſiderable, putting on an appearance almoſt ſimilar to the ſmall-pox, alleviate theſe ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>After this ſtage, now and then the patients become extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drowſy, and have continual twitchings of the tendons, and convulſive eructations, then become ſtupid, forgetful, and fall into a ſtate of lethargy; to which ſucceed convulſions, which are followed ſlowly by ſnoring and death.</p>
               <p>This fever, ſhould the patient recover, is apt to return about the ſame time in the ſucceeding year, and often ſeizes women during their lying-in—whence there is a ſuppreſſion both of their milk and thoſe diſcharges after child-birth, called lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.</p>
               <p>The mildeſt ſort of the miliary fever generally terminates in ſeven, the malignant mixed in fourteen, and this in about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one days.</p>
               <p>There can be little doubt of the nature of this fever, if we pay attention to the ſymptoms, for they beſpeak it truly nervous—hence, for the cure, we muſt refer to what we have ſaid on the nervous fever, (216.) making, perhaps, a freer uſe of bliſters, and obſerving a quicker ſucceſſion, for the reaſons advanced; (290.)</p>
               <p>Sometimes, added to the miliary eruptions, ſuch a train of ſymptoms will attend, as clearly to ſhew its diſpoſition to be of the putrid kind; little deviating from what we have recited when ſpeaking of putrid fever, (221, &amp;c.) and conſequently will require ſimilar applications—but ſtill, though much cannot be expected from bliſters in ſymptoms ſimply putreſcent; yet ſuch is the alleviation they bring in miliary eruption, that to neglect them would be an error of no trifling conſequence—and, if to theſe we add the uſe of bark, mineral acids, and wine, little more can be expected to be done in this fever, as theſe are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal materials from whence we can expect any conſiderable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="unknown:028021_0289_0FD67251125A4DA0"/>
Should a looſeneſs come on under any of the circumſtances of this fever, we muſt proceed in the ſame manner as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed, taking care not to be too buſy in putting a total ſtop to it by the uſe of aſtringents; for if that happens, we may expect a great increaſe of febrile affections, which is invariably the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e; we ſhould rather attempt to ſolicit a ſlow of humours to the ſkin, by ſmall doſes of ipecacuanha, (181.) (No. 57.) and ſupport the ſtrength of the patient by wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, and other generous antiputreſcent cordials.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſigns which portend a favourable concluſion are,</p>
               <p>If <hi>convulſions</hi> begin with, or precede the eruption, and, upon ceaſing, the pulſe becomes ſoft and full, the <hi>puſtules filled with ſerum</hi> grow large—if they are of the red kind, and manifeſt themſelves with a gentle perſpiration, free and eaſy reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the pulſe as above ſpecified, the fever having remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>ſweat</hi> ſhould be violent and premature, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the pulſe at the ſame time ſhould be ſmall, they indicate miſchief.</p>
               <p>A <hi>tingling ſtupor</hi> or <hi>numbneſs</hi> in many places, ſhews that the morbid matter is copious; but if it is ſlight, attended with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery urine, ſweats, and a ſmall pulſe, it not only indicates the ſame, but ſhews the virus not eaſily determined to the ſkin; hence dangerous.</p>
               <p>Should there be <hi>great dejection of ſpirits, the patient become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fearful, loſe all hope, riſe up terrified,</hi> theſe are bad omens—nor is it a promiſing appearance if the <hi>ſkin does not ſwell</hi> from the eruption, nor be affected from the application of bliſters or cupping-glaſſes.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>head-ach</hi> goes off before the fourth day, in thoſe of full habits particularly, it is an unfavourable ſign; and a <hi>ſmall pulſe, growing more ſo after the eruption,</hi> with tenſion, and quickneſs increaſing, denotes convulſions, and diſſolution, or extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>urine</hi> is conſtantly watery, or changes to that from a reddiſh colour; this affords no good ſign; but it beſpeaks a long continuation of the diſeaſe if it is like milk-whey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Drops of blood from the noſe</hi> at any time beſpeak great danger; and, when drawn, if it ſhould be of a ſcarlet colour continually without ſerum, it is a bad ſign.</p>
               <p>If, at the concluſion of the diſeaſe, the <hi>ſcarf-ſkin peels not off at all, or only ſparingly, the convulſive ſymptoms ſtill continuing,</hi> we may expect a relapſe.</p>
               <p>WITH REGARD TO THE ERUPTION, the red are more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than the <hi>white;</hi> and the ſooner they make their appearance,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:028021_0290_0FD6719BB87F3220"/>
ſo much the worſe; for thoſe which appear upon the third or fourth day often prove mortal on the ſeventh or eighth; they are leſs dangerous if they break out on the ſixth; the later the ſafer; for the ſooner they appear, the diſeaſe proportionably of longer continuance, and more apt to return.</p>
               <p>After the eruption all <hi>oppreſſive convulſive ſymptoms</hi> are omin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and thoſe which follow the ſubſiding deſtructive.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>puſtules are ſmall, and very numerous,</hi> they beſpeak dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger—nor is it a favourable ſort <hi>which do not prick, but itch when they are puſhing out of the ſkin</hi>—but if they <hi>recede,</hi> and afterwards the patient vomits, ſees badly, has a rattling noiſe in ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hiccoughs, and ſtammers in talking, theſe import extreme danger.</p>
               <p>By how much more copious and prominent are the puſtules, by ſo much ſooner will death make its approach, if they ſubſide—and thoſe which ſometimes ſubſide, and ſometimes appear, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a long continuance of the diſeaſe.</p>

               <head>§ 7. ERYSIPELAS, or SEROUS INFLAMMATORY FEVER, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called SAINT ANTHONY'S FIRE.</head>
               <p>This is conſidered as an inflammation of the ſkin, and ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent fat, attended with an inflammatory fever, originating from an acrimonious humour and inflamed ſtate of the thinner part of the blood, from which nature endeavours to free herſelf by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the morbid portion from the habit, and depoſiting it on ſome external part, chiefly the ſkin, in broad red ſpots, which creep from place to place—hence its name, from the Greek words <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>las,</hi> into the vicinity.</p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. It generally commences with chillneſs and ſhivering, which in a day or two are ſucceeded by a violent ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den redneſs, and pain, attacking ſome part or other, chiefly the face; and has for its aſſociates an acrid heat, roſy-coloured efflo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſcences, with great tightneſs of the ſkin, ſlightly ſwelled, which is broad and diffuſed, not circumſcribed—the febrile affections increaſe, with heat, anxiety, thirſt, often alſo a white tongue and ſtrong breath.</p>
               <p>But it is often attended with greater degrees of violence—<hi>then</hi> it begins with great ſhiverings, ſucceeded by a burning heat, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute head-ach, retching and vomiting, till the eryſipelas appears, which is ſometimes deferred to the ſecond or third day; when the febrile ſymptoms are alleviated, and the ſickneſs ceaſes, tho', not unfrequently, they continue in a ſlighter degree to the height—ſometimes, when the diſeaſe runs high, the fever continues,
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:028021_0291_0FD67252B2388D58"/>
the brain is oppreſſed, delirium comes on, and matters wear an unpromiſing aſpect.</p>
               <p>Upon the tumid part veſicles ariſe, and run along the forehead hairy ſcalp, eye-lids, neck, forming a circle round them, which, if injudiciouſly treated, become gangrenous, and creates delirium—ſometimes the humour filling the puſtules, and iſſuing from thence, inſtead of being thin and ſerous, is thick and gluey, and forms a thick ſcurf or cruſt, continuing fixed before they fall off, for many days.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe frequently terminates in ſeven days; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it will proceed in a ſimilar manner for eight, ten, or twelve days, and at laſt go off by a copious ſweat, of which reſtleſſneſs, with concomitant ſhivering, and ſome anxiety, though not much, for a ſmall ſpace of time, will be ſometimes the forerunners; and from thence may the critical effort be prognoſticated. During the progreſs of this complaint, the whole ſkin and inſide of the mouth is very dry.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are ſaid to be, violent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal affection, particularly anger and fear—a ſudden cooling of the body, heated before by the ſtrong power of the ſun—drinking of, or bathing in, too cold water—a ſuppreſſion of the natural or artificial evacuations—moiſt and rainy ſeaſons—and, in fine, whatever occaſions the obſtruction of perſpiration.</p>
               <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> acrimonious and heating particles derived from humours that are contaminated and retained, which ought to be thrown out of the habit.</p>
               <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. An inflammatory fever, for the moſt part, of a few days continuance, with a ſuperficial, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, diffuſive ſwelling, of a red roſe colour, going off upon preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and returning; of an uniform ſmoothneſs, unleſs made rough by eruptions; and is attended with an acrid burning, or itching heat.</p>
               <p>CURE. As this diſeaſe, though neither infections nor conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, evidently ariſes from ſome acrid humours ejected out of the maſs of fluids, and collected in the cuticular veſſels, through which it ought to eſcape out of the habit, we muſt be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious not to lower the fever too much by exceſſive evacuations; nor hinder the exit, or cauſe the retroceſſion when diſcharged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſkin by the injudicious adminiſtration of cold or aſtringent applications; for the indications of cure are, ſo to regulate the moving powers, as to enable them to throw the offenſive matter out of the conſtitution, and prevent any retroceſſion on the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and vital parts.</p>
               <p>Hence, therefore, muſt we proceed, as in other caſes, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with the ſtrength of the habit. If it attacks thoſe of ſtrong
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:028021_0292_0FD671A04CA84BA0"/>
full conſtitutions, we bleed in proportion to the ſtrength, and give the cooling cathartics, ſuch as purge off the ſerous humours in the moſt certain and eaſieſt mode, as vitriolated natron, ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated tartar, Polychreſt ſalt, Epſom ſalt, manna, tamarinds, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals of tartar, jalap, &amp;c. (171, 172.) (No. 1. 22 to 24.) and, on the intermediate days, we ſhould give at intervals antimonials joined with nitre, acetated tartar, or the ſaline mixture; to which gentle aperients may be added, if neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Emetics in this caſe have been found efficacious—muſtard poultices applied to the feet, and bathing the legs and feet in warm water are very beneficial, where the head and face are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected—and, under this circumſtance, bleeding and purging may be repeated, till an alleviation of the ſymptoms are produced.</p>
               <p>In all our endeavous we ſhould attempt to promote gentle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation by the ſkin with cooling diaphoretics.</p>
               <p>There have been different opinions with reſpect to local appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the part affected; ſome adviſe mild and ſoftening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the part affected, as freſh cream, the ointment of elder leaves, tepid watery fomentations, or the uſe of the water of acetated litharge—however, the fine powder of fenugreek, or wheat flour, ſprinkled upon the part, and lying in bed—or, if a fluid begins to ooze out of the veſicles, chalk or ſtarch may be ſprinkled on a ſoft cloth, and thus applied; for all repellents, whether of an aqueous or oily nature, are hurtful.</p>
               <p>Should the ſwelling be ſuddenly depreſſed, from a retroceſſion of the offenſive matter, attended with internal oppreſſion and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety, and at the ſame time the pulſe becomes weak and ſinks, we muſt immediately apply bliſters, and have recourſe to vinous and other cordials; wine may be exhibited freely, volatile and other ſtimulants, which have more permanent action, ſuch as the nature of the circumſtances require.</p>
               <p>Sometimes this diſeaſe attacks the trunk, cheſt, ſhoulder-blades, or ſides, and frequently makes its appearance lower, encircling the middle of the body, like a belt—hence called by the Greeks ZOSTER and ZONA, a belt; and by the Engliſh SHINGLES, from the Latin word <hi>cingulum,</hi> a girdle.</p>
               <p>In this complaint little yellowiſh pimples, but more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a livid hue, ariſe which are went to corrode, like a tetter, which ſpecies they reſemble.</p>
               <p>The fever which is the aſſociate of this eruption is only ſlight; but, ſhould the pimples be puſhed back, ſymptoms of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence preſent themſelves.</p>
               <p>There have been inſtances where the eryſipelas has begun with ſhivering, heat, delirium, violent pain of the back, head, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the body, where there was no inflammation; but

upon the third or fourth day, the hot burning humour was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the glands under the arms, or in the groin, and there formed abſceſſes; or deſcended into the feet, and brought on mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; and from a retroceſſion of the morbid matter, life was in the moſt extreme danger.</p>
               <p>For if this matter cannot be made to re-appear, the peccant humour is depoſited upon the brain or breaſt, and death is ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the conſequence—if the depoſition happens upon the brain, delirium immediately ſucceeds, the viſage is fluſhed, the eyes ſparkle very quick, then follows madneſs, terminating fatally in lethargy; but ſhould it be upon the lungs, the heat and anxiety is intolerable, of which no words are adequate to convey a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect idea.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe appearances, our modes of cure vary not from that which we have before deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Though, in general, the eryſipelas very ſeldom comes to ſuppuration, ſtill, when that is the caſe, it does not maturate kindly, and frequently forms diſagreeable and ill-conditioned ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a mortification will threaten, then muſt we apply ſuch things as are calculated to ſtop its progreſs, as decoction of bark, lime-water mixed with camphor and ſpirits of wine, or camphorated ſpirits of wine, with tincture of myrrh.</p>
               <p>In the ſlighter kinds of eryſipelas there is no great danger; but if a violent inflammation, attended with ſtupor, drowſineſs, or delirium, ſhould ſeize patients with an acrimonious ſtate of fluids, much are the conſequences to be dreaded.</p>
               <p>Should the inflammation recede or be repelled, it brings on delirium, internal inflammations, aſthma, convulſions and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; or ſhould the tumid part grow livid, we may conclude the latter of theſe affections at hand. With reſpect to the puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules, the thicker and whiter the matter, the leſs will be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of danger; but ſhould it be thin and pale, ſo much more in proportion will it be increaſed.</p>

               <p>IN a former ſection we have ſpoken of inflammatory fever, (201.) which we have ſaid depended upon a peculiar ſtate of the vaſcular ſyſtem and blood, the moving powers, or part of them, put into too ſtrong motion, and ſupported in the violence of their action by the peculiarity of that ſtate: here the affections were general, produced not by, or dependent upon, any other diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But in this place we are to treat of local affections, having a fever for their aſſociate; hence it is to be conſidered, not as a primary, but as a ſecondary diſeaſe, produced by, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> dependent on, ſome other; conſequently only a ſign that ſome other mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reigns in the habit—the firſt of theſe fevers is called IDIOPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THIC, the ſecond SYMPTOMATIC.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="unknown:028021_0295_0FD67257F8015378"/>
Now, in inflammation there are ſome particulars obſervable, which, on examination, will lead us to the cauſe, and enable us to lay down certain rules for the cure.</p>
               <p>In a part under a ſtate of inflammation there are <hi>more than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, redneſs, tenſion, pain,</hi> and <hi>ſwelling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The FIRST is produced by the blood circulating to the part with more than uſual force, and being there collected in too great quantity; and wherever that is the caſe, there is a proportionate increaſe of warmth—the SECOND is owing to the blood being puſhed into thoſe veſſels, which, in an healthful ſtate, are only permitted to carry the ſerous or thinner fluids ſtrained from the ſanguinary maſs—the THIRD ariſes from a too great quantity of fluids crowding into the containing veſſels, by which they are diſtended, and their fibres diſtracted, which produces the FOURTH, or PAIN—and the FIFTH deduces its origin from the diſtenſion, and the fluids being too freely puſhed into the cellular membrane; or exuding through the coats of the veſſel, by their natural parts being too permeable, from the ſuperabundant quantity of liquids they contain.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe effects may be produced by <hi>ſtimulus</hi> of ſome nature applied to the parts affected, increaſing the action of the veſſels, which ſolicits the fluids to theſe parts too rapidly, and produces <hi>diſtenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appears obvious, that theſe two cauſes are adequate to create theſe effects—one of which acting will occaſion only a ſlight degree of inflammation, of no long continuance—but if they both are conjoined, then ariſes an inflammatory diſeaſe of greater violence and duration; inaſmuch as, from theſe two cauſes co-operating, the effects produced will be more vehement.</p>
               <p>But in the parts which are moſt ſolid, or in which the veſſels continue their courſe in a ſtraight direction, ſhould any inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ariſe, <hi>there</hi> will conſequently be greater degree of pain, than if it happens in the ſofter viſcera, or glandular parts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is always a higher degree of tenſion in the veſſels—hence in firm membranous parts, the ſkin, ligaments, tendons, cartilages, and bones, (21, 22. 24.) inflammations are found more acutely painful, whilſt in the ſofter parts before-mentioned, the pain is ſometimes ſlight, and always inferior to that of the other.</p>
               <p>But external accidents will, by producing the two cauſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, (298.) create local inflammatory ſymptoms, whilſt the vaſcular ſyſtem in general ſhall perceive no diſturbance, which will not at all be indicated by the pulſe, or other febrile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo that if a fever ſhould ariſe, as it generally does in all conſiderable inflammations, it is to be conſidered as owing its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:028021_0296_0FD671A05710D0D0"/>
to this cauſe, and is a conſequence, therefore only eſteemed a ſymptoms; for exceſſive heat, thirſt, and reſtleſſneſs, are conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants of vaſcular affection, and generally attend inflammatory diſeaſes, independent of any fever, except what they themſelves create; whilſt weakneſs and loſs of appetite, eſſential ſymptoms attendant on primary or idiopathic (298.) fevers of any continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are wanting, and ſeem to belong to affections of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>But ſome inflammations owe their origin to fever, and may be occaſioned by peculiar cauſes; either from the elective power of morbid matter thrown into the habit, that is, a predeliction for fixing on ſome peculiar part or parts in preference to others, as in the ſmall-pox, meazles, gout, rheumatiſm, &amp;c. or from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conſtitutional imperfection—hence we find, different parts may become the ſeat of inflammation from general cauſes alſo; for if the reſiſtance of any part is ſupernaturally increaſed, and a ſtimulus ſhould be applied to them from acrid humours circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in the maſs of fluids, and fixing there, an inflammation will be the unavoidable conſequence—and theſe very often terminate fatally, ſhould it in fevers fix in ſome of the nobler parts; and to theſe is often to be attributed in many fevers the death of the patient.</p>
               <p>If we reflect on the cauſe of inflammation, we ſhall find, that every part of the human machine, which is plentifully ſupplied with blood veſſels interwoven in their texture, is ſubject to this affection—and <hi>moſtly ſo</hi> are thoſe parts which are liable to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to external injuries; or to ſtimulating materials, which circulate and are buoyed up in the atmoſphere; though ſome of the very thin membranes, the ſcarf-ſkin, hair, and nails, may be conſidered as exceptions.</p>
               <p>Hence, according to the conſequence of the part affected, will be the diſturbance of the conſtitution, and the degree of danger; and theſe will manifeſt themſelves according as the uſe of thoſe parts is moſt immediately connected with thoſe actions of the conſtitution on which life is immediately dependent, by which the machine is nouriſhed, and its parts kept in proper order, and from whence it has its power of motion, diſtinguiſhed by the terms <hi>vital, natural,</hi> and <hi>animal</hi>—upon all which, acting in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is conſtituted the welfare of that machine.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the termination of inflammation, there are five modes, RESOLUTION, EXUDATION, SUPPURATION, MORTIFICA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, and SCIRRHUS.</p>
               <p>Inflammation is conſidered to terminate in RESOLUTION when, in the firſt inſtance, the flow of blood is diverted from the part affected, the violence of vaſcular action allayed, and ſtrength giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:028021_0297_0FD6725A0B126578"/>
to the coats of the veſſels, ſo that they may be properly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and the diſſipation of the load of fluids which have been collected be procured; or they may be reſorbed into the habit—by EXUDATION, which occurs only in ſuperficial inflammations on the ſkin, and membranes lining internal cavities or paſſages, or covering the different viſcera, when diſtenſion of the arteries, and an enlargement of the pores of their ſides takes place, by the rapidity of motion producing more than uſual force on the veſſels in an inflammatory ſtate, occaſioning great increaſe of heat, and expanſion of the contained fluids.</p>
               <p>In this manner frequently ends eryſipelas, by puſhing forth little puſtules or bliſters, and freeing the veſſels which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed—ſo alſo in burns and wounds matter exudes, which is termed digeſtion; and as this comes on and continues, ſo are the parts affected alleviated, and totally cured. Nature alſo makes uſe of this expedient in catarrhal and other ſlightly inflammatory complaints of the lungs, as well as in the gonorrhoea virulenta, or clap; for all theſe are ſuperficial inflammations—by ABSCESS, or SUPPURATION, when neither of theſe proceſſes takes place, but the violence of motion continues or increaſes, and the weakneſs of the veſſels ſtill remains; then the fluids which have been col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the cellular membrane are either too copious, or become ſo thick and viſcid, that they cannot be abſorbed and received back into the circulating fluids, nor puſhed out, and thus evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated through the pores of the ſkin—amongſt theſe another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs takes place, termed FERMENTATION, wherein the veſſels, cellular membrane, and muſcular fibres are melted down, and a white thick matter is formed, called pus; but this happens chiefly in more deep ſeated inflammations in ſome viſcous, fleſhy, or glandular parts—by MORTIFICATION, when the force of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation is ſo violent againſt the ſides of the inflamed veſſels, that the coats are ruptured; or when the arterial coats are ſo very weak, that the blood burſting into the cavities of the cellular membrane there ſtagnates, and quickly corrupts, forming what is called in medical language GANGRENE, or SPHACELUS; the firſt conſidered by ſome as mortification in its incipient ſtate, the laſt when it is perfectly formed; but others, when the ſkin and cellular membranes are the parts affected, give it the former name; when the muſcular, the latter; when the bones, it is called CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES; ſo, in fact, they are all truly mortifications, though only of different parts.</p>
               <p>When mortification takes place, there is a ceſſation in the part of all pain, from the deſtruction of the living ſolids; hence the protruſion of blood, which becomes of a darker colour than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or has a livid appearance, hence its ſtagnation and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:028021_0298_0FD672BB01038968"/>
and deprivation of its natural colour—after this, a ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous ſeparation of the parts which compoſe it takes place, the thinner part is driven forwards towards the ſurface, and elevates the cuticle into bliſters.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, we may form a judgment why mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications are moſt likely to occur in thoſe whoſe fluids are in an acrid ſtate, old people, and thoſe of dropſical habit; becauſe the ſolids are ſoon broken down, and many ſlight accidents are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to produce theſe dangerous, and often fatal effects, which we at firſt obſerve with an unſuſpicious eye, when they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by inflammations of ſome force; for, indeed, in conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not labouring under theſe defects they rarely happen.</p>
               <p>The laſt termination we ſhall mention is, SCIRRHUS, here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a hard indolent tumour only, and chiefly preſents itſelf in the ſpongy viſcera, as the lungs, meſentery, womb, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the glands in various parts of the machine.</p>
               <p>And this generally ariſes from the circulation in the glands, generally being too languid—hence are obſtructions formed from the fluids inſpiſſating within the ſmall capillary, or hair like tubes, and only producing vaſcular diſtenſion ſo gradually, that there is no great exceſs of pain, nor any violent increaſe of heat, ſo that proper power is wanting to create that proceſs which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſuppuration, and alſo force ſufficient to break down the veſſels, and produce mortification, which in theſe parts are ſaid ſeldom to take place, except from acrimony of the ſharpeſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pouring down on the veſſels of any particular gland, and being there depoſited.</p>
               <p>Inflammation then may be conſidered only as one cauſe of ſcirrhus, which induce theſe tumours by imperceptible degrees, and very ſlow beginnings, which are attributed to ſome peculiar indeſcribable defect of the humours, terminating frequently in cancerous affections.</p>
               <p>They are, beſides, productive of great miſchief from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the neighbouring parts, as palſy, impeded deglutition, barrenneſs, and many other complaints.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid on this ſubject of inflammation, we ſhall be readily and forcibly ſtruck with the moſt eligible modes of termination.</p>
               <p>The firſt is by <hi>reſolution,</hi> the ſecond by <hi>exudation,</hi> if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exuded can have a free exit out of the habit; but in thoſe inflammatory affections which make the membrane that lines the cavity of the breaſt, and abdomen, or belly; or which cover the different viſcera contained in them—the objects of their attack; and if the matter which from that cauſe exudes from their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face ſhould remain there, a hectic fever will be the conſequence,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:028021_0299_0FD672B5ECAAFF60"/>
though the original pain ceaſes, and a freſh concourſe of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms will then ſucceed. But ſuppoſe neither of theſe termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can be brought about, we then wiſh for ABSCESS, becauſe only the inert ſolids ſuffer chiefly, and ſeldom have any perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent bad effects, if they can only be permitted to clear themſelves; for then the parts heal up; nor have the nerves or blood-veſſels ſuffered any material deſtruction, though the laſt may have been diſtended, and ſuffered greatly from ſuch diſtenſion; yet, once freed from the impelling cauſe, ſoon recover their tone, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to perform properly their conſtitutional action; and as for the inert ſolids, they are again ſoon ſupplied, by the digeſtive powers of the machine forming freſh materials from nutriment, in order to renew the ſubſtance loſt, by the application of homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous particles poured into the interſtices of the celullar mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.</p>
               <p>In all our attempts to cure inflammatory complaints, our firſt aim is <hi>reſolution,</hi> whether the part affected be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or internal; the former of which is obvious to ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; the latter, by heat and pain affecting ſome inward part, accompanied with general febrile affections; of which we ſhall ſpeak more particularly when we come to treat on parts labouring under this complaint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> at preſent we ſhall ſhew how we attempt to bring about reſolution, when any conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation calls for our aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>If it occurs in habits which are plethoric and ſtrong, the pulſe full and quick, and much increaſe of heat, we purſue the ſame courſe as was delivered when treating on inflammatory fever, § 2. Section VIII. attempting to allay the intenſeneſs of motion in the vaſcular ſyſtem, and abating the exceſs of heat, which is the natural concomitant.</p>
               <p>But here ſometimes the complaint yields not to general bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we then ſhould have recourſe to local, by the application of leeches or cupping-glaſſes near the part affected, which will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often ſucceed; and as there is too great a flow of fluids to the part, we endeavour to leſſen that by ſmart cooling purges, (No. 3. 22 to 24.) giving freely in the intermediate times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the purges, nitrous powder, (No. 2.) mixed with ſmall doſes of antimonials, (180.) gentle aperients, (171, 172.) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cooling ſaline diuretics, (176.) applying to the parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fomentations, (No. 85.) with which let the part affected be fomented three or four times a day, and continued at each time for half an hour, or longer, taking care not to apply it too hot, but only moderately warm.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the inflamed part ſhould be covered with a white bread poultice, in which a ſufficient quantity of ointment of marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:028021_0300_0FD672BD5093A318"/>
has been uſed—ſome adviſe a poultice of bread boiled in litharge water, called vegeto-mineral water; others of wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees thickened with bran; and ſeveral prefer that of bean-meal and ſimple oxymel, ſoftened with oil of roſes—and ſhould the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and inflammation be by theſe means diſſipated, the poultices ſhould be changed for ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pes moiſtened with the camphorated lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (No. 86.) and occaſionally applied to the parts.</p>
               <p>By theſe means commonly reſolution will take place, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours collected in the part being diſſipated, and the remainder abſorbed back into the habit, by the lymphatic ſyſtem being freed ſufficiently, and ſtimulated to a reproduction of its action in the part affected.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding our efforts, if the common ſymptoms ſhould gradually increaſe, ſuch as great heat, throbbing in the part affected, ſuppuration will take place, and an abſceſs be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—here, then, our mode of cure muſt be altered, and we muſt aim at ſoliciting the matter externally, and freeing the habit in a proper time, by the application of thoſe things which promote ſuppuration, thin the external ſkin, and determine the contained matter towards the ſurface.</p>
               <p>Hence poultices made of mallow leaves, boiled in milk with linſeed, or linſeed itſelf—boiled lily roots, or onions—the matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating cataplaſm—or the gum plaiſter, will anſwer the purpoſe; for theſe, by clogging the pores of the ſkin, prevent the diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humours, increaſe the heat of the contained fluids, promote the proceſs of fermentation, and render the humours more active in diſſolving, or melting down the ſolid parts, as well as ſoften the integuments, and, by their ſtimulus, ſolicit the fluids to puſh outwards.</p>
               <p>From theſe applications, then, the abſceſs will ſoon he in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtate for opening; which muſt be performed in the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent part, if the ſwelling is equally ſoft throughout, and the ſkin of a ſimilar thinneſs; if not, where the part is ſofteſt, and the fluctuation of the matter moſt perceptible; and the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be made of ſufficient width, in proportion to the ſize of the tumor, that a free egreſs may be allowed for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>After this, the healing of the wound in good conſtitutions is ſeldom attended with any difficulty—dry lint placed gently in the part, and that covered with the ointment of yellow reſin, ſpread thin upon lint or tow, are the general dreſſings at firſt; and from theſe freſh granulations will appear; and in time fill up the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity occaſioned by the loſs of ſubſtance; but ſhould the ſore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſoul, covered at the bottom with a white or brown appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, inſtead of red granulated fleſh, we muſt apply ſome of thoſe
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:028021_0301_0FD627EB46063898"/>
things conſidered detergent, or cleanſing; as the ointment of gum elemi, of yellow reſin, mixed with a proper proportion of red precipitate, or green baſilicon; theſe will cleanſe the ulcer; and then dry lint as before, and proper bandages, will in common perform a perfect cure.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes, inſtead of a thick well-coloured laudable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there will be a thin ichorous diſcharge, occaſioned by an acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſtate of humours, while, at the ſame time, there will be febrile hectic ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>Under theſe circumſtances, in order to produce a laudable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, and take off the hectic affections, in relaxed habits, joined with an acrid ſtate of the fluids, bark is the moſt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious remedy; but where the diſcharge depends more upon the ſtate of the fluids, in order to correct or evacuate the acrimony, a courſe of mercurial medicines, as the alternative mercurial pills, two of which may be taken twice a day, with one or two pints of the decoction of the woods, (No. 87, 88.) bid faireſt for ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>There is a ſpecies of complaint very common belonging to this place, which here calls for our attention, and that is, a</p>
               <p>BOIL, or BILE, though this ſeldom terminates by reſolution, but commonly maturates—it is a hard circumſcribed tumour, riſing to a point, hot, red, and very painful, which, maturating, may be let out, or left to burſt, from whence a ſmall portion of matter only will iſſue forth, in proportion to the ſwelling, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſlough behind, which is called a CORE, and muſt be caſt off before the wound can be healed.</p>
               <p>In its hard and painful ſtate, we can have no expectations of diſcuſſions; our endeavours, therefore, are to be confined to haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening the ſuppuration, as we have before directed, (304.) or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply bean-meal and honey, which is a favourite remedy with ſome—when it is opened or burſt, we muſt proceed as before under the ſame circumſtances in abſceſs (304.)</p>
               <p>But theſe eruptions very often originate from a depraved ſtate of the fluids, which occaſion their frequent returns, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely trouble ſome—here we muſt have reference to the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive courſe before recommended, (305.) which muſt be perſiſted in for ſome time, now and then interpoſing gentle cooling purgatives.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have ſpoken of thoſe inflammations which lie ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially, and are alleviated by <hi>appeaſing</hi> applications; but ſometimes the ſeat of the complaint will be too internal for them to become effectual, we then apply over the part ſtimulants, which have been found highly efficacious in producing reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—indeed, where complaints have been ſlight, applications of hot ſand or ſalt, ſtimulating cataplaſms, as of muſtard, pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, horſe-radiſh, Burgundy pitch, volatile liniments rubbed well upon the part, have been found ſerviceable auxiliaries; but
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:028021_0302_0FD672BEC69CF288"/>
when the ſymptoms have been more ſevere, bliſters applied over the part contribute the moſt readily to promote reſolution.</p>
               <p>Theſe remedies, and the ſedatives and emollients we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of, where the cauſe has been exceſs of the vibratory motion of the veſſels dependent on ſome ſtimulus, and external remedies can be applied, have been thought neceſſary—or when inflammation proceeds from fractures, wounds, contuſions, or ſuch like cauſes, diſcutient fomentations, (No. 85.) are moſt of all to be relied on—when it depends on <hi>local relaxation,</hi> or <hi>a decreaſe of vaſcular reſiſtance,</hi> as it ſometimes does, particularly in inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of long ſtanding—bleeding and purging ſhould be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly adviſed, and all emollient poultices and fomentations omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for theſe, by their relaxing properties, will add to the cauſe a contrary plan muſt be adopted, calculated to give ſtrength and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to the veſſels, that the offending cauſe may be repelled.</p>
               <p>For local applications, alum, white vitriol, acetated litharge, lapis calaminaris, and turty prepared, mixed with roſe-water, are occaſionally uſed; as are alſo tincture of roſes, and ſlight decoctions of bark, and eye-waters; gargles made of theſe well adapted to relieve inflammatory complaints ariſing from a debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated and relaxed ſtate of the veſſels—and where the general ſtate of the habit is ſo relaxed, as to demand the uſe of tonics, or ſuch things as invigorate the ſyſtem, bark and cold bathing are highly uſeful.</p>
               <p>By the modes we have laid down, we ſhall almoſt always be able to conquer any common inflammation; or conduct our patient through with the greateſt eaſe and ſafety, if abſceſs ſhould take place—but there are ſome niceties to be obſerved, which we ſhall particularize.</p>
               <p>Fomentations ſhould never be puſhed too far; for, after tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the violence of vaſcular motion, if continued, they induce a ſtate of relaxation in the fibres, from which ſucceed debility, and obſtinate tumours—inſtead, therefore, in perſevering in their uſe, when exceſs of vibratory motion is ſubdued totally, and it many caſes when it is allayed, corroborants then become neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (No. 86.) or ſomething of a ſimilar nature.</p>
               <p>With regard to abſceſſes, we muſt obſerve, that they all point, and the contained matter endeavours to make its way to the parts where it finds the leaſt reſiſtance—hence thoſe formed in the lungs rupture internally; thoſe in the viſcera of the belly move externally—thoſe which are deep ſeated, and formed under ſtrong tendinous expanſions, run along the ſpaces between the muſcles, and appear at a conſiderable diſtance from whence they firſt originated.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they do not all originate from inflammation preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its regular courſe; they are ſometimes critical, the effect of
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:028021_0303_0FD627EFB94C9FF8"/>
nature freeing the conſtitution from ſome morbid matter, by throwing it out of the circulation, and depoſiting it in ſome lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſituation, which is attended with the moſt happy conſequenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, admit the vital organs, or the parts of high importance in the habit eſcape, from its being depoſited in them. Abſceſſes of this kind are generally preceded by ſome fever; and this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter is called metaſtaſis, or tranſlation, which occurs chiefly in parts where the veſſels labour under ſome uncommon weakneſs, from ſome cauſe which has left them in that ſtate.</p>
               <p>Under this circumſtance, as ſoon as ever the ſkin is in a proper ſtate of thinneſs, the matter muſt be let out by inciſion, if it can be come at, elſe would it, by too long continuance, diſſolve too much of the ſolid parts, deſtroy the texture of the nerves and blood-veſſels, produce a caries, or mortification of the bones, by penetrating through the membrane which covers them, and lay the foundation for a hectic fever, from the matter being taken up by the abſorbent veſſels, and carried into the habit.</p>
               <p>In caſes of EXUDATION, (300.) where the ſurface appears on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excoriated, not ulcerated, we can give the happieſt aſſiſtance, when it ſhews itſelf externally by <hi>internally</hi> exhibiting ſuch things as tend to promote reſolution; and having recourſe <hi>externally</hi> to ſuch as are calculated to cleanſe, heal up, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> then.</p>
               <p>And when ſuch is the circumſtance on the membranes of the breaſt, of the belly, or the external ſurface of the viſcera, as it ſometimes is, we are aſſured, from the appearances on diſſection, where there has been no perceptible ulcerations or deſtruction of the ſolids, though matter has been found in theſe cavities; by early advice judiciouſly given, many might be ſaved from ſome of our moſt fatal complaints, pulmonary, and ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions; for many of theſe ariſe not, <hi>in the firſt inſtance,</hi> from ulcerations or little glandular tumors in the lungs, called tuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but from matter exuded from membranous ſurfaces, which acquire a degree of acrimony, and then, by melting down the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, cauſe ulcerations: and I have no doubt but by a very early application toſuch modes as we have ſpecified for reſolution, theſe miſchiefs might be often prevented—but here the great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is delay; patients, in the infancy of this complaint, by dabs, noſtrums, and old family preſcriptions, loſing the favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which ought to be given to the well-informed phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, applying for ſuch aid only when ſome of the internal parts have ſuffered irrecoverable injury.</p>
               <p>Though we have before ſpoken of the eryſipelas, or Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony's fire, which ariſes from a febrile cauſe, there is another ſort which ſometimes ſucceeds external injury; and in this, if the inflammation runs high, bleeding and purging are highly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious; and in the intermediate times, betwixt the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:028021_0304_0FD672C0332EAD28"/>
of purgatives, I depend upon ſaline diuretics, (176.) and even thoſe purgatives which I prefer, are ſuch as moſt powerfully eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the ſerous humours, ſuch as vitriolated natron, Rochelle ſalt, regenerated tartar, jalap, ſyrup of buck thorn, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The external applications in theſe caſes ſhould be ſuch as will expel the obſtructed fluids through the pores of the ſkin; hence diluent fomentations are recommended, decoction of linſeed, and white poppy heads, with elder and chamomile flowers, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per proportion of ſoap liniment, one ounce and a half to two ounces to a quart, whilſt there is no break upon the ſkin—chalk, or fine flour, ſpread upon the part, and confined with a fine rag—and lotions of the vegeto-mineral water are thought by ſome highly ſerviceable, where reſolution is the aim.</p>
               <p>But when pimples or painful bliſters make their appearance, equal parts of lime-water, oil, vinegar, and comphorated ſpirit of wine, form an efficacious compoſition to lay on the inflamed part, by means of a rag dipped into, and well loaded with it—or the ointment called unguentum tripharmacum, or that of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetated ceruſs, have been conſidered as proper applications.</p>
               <p>We muſt now proceed to ſpeak on MORTIFICATION, another termination of inflammation, (301.) which generally proceeds in the following manner. At firſt the ſwelled part begins at the point to grow yellow, the pain is mitigated, and a dingy colour comes on; the ſkin is flabby and ſoft, retaining the impreſſion made by a finger upon it, it loſes almoſt all ſenſation, and grows livid—a tumid elevation of the part is perceived, which diffuſes itſelf around—there appears puſtules of a thin yellowiſh acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious liquid, which are black at their baſis—then the ſkin and parts underneath corrupt, become dead, black, loſing all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and diſſolve into a foetid ſtinking ſanies—the mortification creeps onwards, and ſeizes the neighbouring parts—at length ſhivering, fever, cold ſweats, ſmall and weak pulſe, and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beſpeak the approach of death.</p>
               <p>In the beginning, when the ſource of this miſchief has been external injury, and there is much ſtrength of conſtitution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by a full, hard, quick pulſe, high degrees of heat, pain, and dryneſs, the cooling method is to be purſued, as if reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to be brought about; and though in this we cannot hope to ſucceed, we are warranted in this mode of procedure, by the extreme violence of the ſymptoms, with intent to bring on a ſtate of ſuppuration, by checking the vehemence of the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and preventing the veſſels from being ruptured—beſides, exudation would be favoured from the continuance of relaxing and emollient fomentations.</p>
               <p>But mortifications ariſe from very different ſources, and affect different conſtitutions—ſhould they happen to patients, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:028021_0305_0FD628AFB8A0AC70"/>
whoſe blood is in a thin, acrid, putreſcent ſtate, which will be indicated by debility of the pulſe, loſs of ſtrength, lowneſs of ſpirits, foetid thin acrimonious diſcharges, and, ſhould blood be taken, by its texture being very weak, we muſt have recourſe to invigorating and cordial remedies; as bark, wine, mineral acids, and ſuch like, in order to prevent the acceſs of gangrene, and produce a ſeparation of the part affected; and, in caſes of great pain, opiates have been adviſed with very fortunate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; indeed, whether the cauſe is internal or external, the free uſe of opium is directed, and conſidered as the greateſt internal cordial known—as an external application, the antiputreſcent lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (No. 90.) is recommended to be applied frequently, warm, as it is alſo ſtimulant and digeſtive—cataplaſms of cummin-ſeed, and the carrot poultice, are much approved; but if emollients are mixed with antiſeptics, (192.) they are ſaid to aſſiſt in the ſeparation of the putrid parts, and ſtopping mortification.</p>
               <p>The laſt termination of inflammation is SCIRRHUS, (302.) or indolent tumor, which ariſes from obſtructions forming in ſome of the glandular parts, as before deſcribed, where either no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration takes place, or if it does, it is in no ſmall a degree, that it has not power to melt down the ſolids ſufficiently to remove the induration—or it may be brought on by the too long uſe of warm fomentations, ſoliciting too free and long continued flux of humours, relaxing the veſſels of the parts, hence occaſioning haro ſwellings, which are not eaſily removed.</p>
               <p>Now theſe ſwellings which we here conſider are totally free from all acrimony of any peculiar nature, and, as the fluids are in a ſound ſtate, it is often the moſt eligible practice not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere by any applications—becauſe in young ſubjects they will very often gradually wear away; in older ones continue gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally without creating any uneaſineſs or inconvenience—but ſhould the hardneſs be ſo conſiderable as to require particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, warm vapour or ſteam directed to, and confined to act upon the part affected, is one of the moſt efficacious applications in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Sometimes theſe tumors are ſoft and flabby, then frictions, and well adapted bandages, where they can be applied, are uſeful; or letting cold water fall from ſome height upon the part, or pumping upon it, ſeems beſt calculated to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>Thus far has it been neceſſary to premiſe, before we enter on the inflammation of the different parts, wherein the treatment of the inflammatory ſymptoms will be nearly ſimilar; but there will be ſome deviation neceſſary on account of the parts affected—for the INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN will require a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent treatment from that of the <hi>eye</hi>—OF THE EYE from that of

                  <p>THIS is ſo called from the Greek word <hi>phren,</hi> mens the mind; becauſe the brain is ſuppoſed to be its ſeat.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. The ſymptoms at the onſet are, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the general affections, ſimilar to what occur in the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of the inflammatory fever, only the head ſeems to be more violently affected; for in this there is pain and pulſation of the head, with a ſounding noiſe, a ringing in the ears, and diſturbed ſleep—the eyes are painful and inflamed, almoſt always ſhunning the light—the countenance is puffed, the hearing acute, and the patient is irritated from the ſlighteſt noiſe—the pulſe, for the moſt part, is weak, ſometimes hard, <hi>always</hi> low and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed—the urine looks pale like water—and continued watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are protracted to the eighth day—the pulſation of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotid arteries is perceptible—ſometimes blood flows from the noſe—there is great debility, anxiety, and frequent ſighing—the tongue is ſometimes white and moiſt, ſometimes black and dry—the patients are uncommonly iraſcible, labouring under a feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous delirium and convulſions.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing,</hi> ſevere drinking of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briating liquids, particularly ardent ſpirits—watchings, long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to the ſcorching rays of the ſun, particularly if the head is uncovered—violent rage—too deep and long continued think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—exceſſive grief—violent love—a ſuppreſſion of the piles, and thoſe diſcharges in women after child-birth, called lochia.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> CAUSES, a true inflammation of the membranes of the brain, or a congeſtion of blood in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the brain, or both conjointly.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. An acute febrile affection, attended with pain of the head—redneſs of the face and eyes—incapability of bearing the light or ſound—perpetual watching—a violent delirium, or delirium attended with ſome degree of apparent drowſineſs.</p>
                  <p>

This diſeaſe terminates between the ſeventh and fourteenth day, by reſolution—haemorrhage from the noſe; in wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, by a flow of the menſes—looſeneſs, or depoſition of a copious ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the urine;—but ſhould not ſome of theſe occur, ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or mortification is the conſequence: it often, though, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into other diſeaſes, as mania, i. e. delirium or madneſs without fever, lethargy, melancholy, or idiotiſm—when people recover, they will be affected a long time with giddineſs, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pain of the eyes, quickneſs of hearing, and a heavineſs of the head.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould be particularly careful in diſtinguiſhing this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe from the delirium, that common attendant in many fevers: and this knowledge may be acquired by obſerving, <hi>that in this ſpecies the delirium comes on firſt, and is perceptible and violent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is any great degree of fever</hi>—in other caſes it is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to fever which has continued for ſome days before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium is manifeſt; and the degree of phrenzy is correſpondent to the degree of fever; but in the true inflammation of the brain the degree of fever is nearly adequate to the delirium, which is equal to what we meet with in real madneſs, from which the inflammation of the brain is ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſhed, but by the ſhortneſs of the continuance; as in the ſpace of a few days it muſt either inevitably terminate in recovery or death.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe is either idiopathic, (299.) or ſymptomatic, (299.)—the <hi>firſt,</hi> wherein the head is primarily affected, rarely appears in temperate climates—but the <hi>ſecond</hi> very often occurs, and moſt frequently about the criſis of fevers; and is generally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with chillneſs, tremor of the joints, diſtenſion about the pit of the ſtomach, coldneſs of the extremities, thin urine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged too copiouſly, or too ſparingly; and moſt commonly, if violent, proves mortal, from the conſtitution being reduced to a ſtate of great weakneſs from the preceding diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>From the great conſequence of which the brain is to the life of man, this becomes a moſt dangerous diſeaſe, from that part being affected—men experience greater degrees of violence in this diſeaſe, and recover with more difficulty than women—the more the patients are, and the more they recede, from their natural ſtate and diſpoſition, the greater is the danger—bleeding at the noſe is a good omen; but if the phrenzy changes into a lethargy, it is bad; and total loſs of, or a trembling voice, convulſions, hiccough, may be looked on as extremely unfavourable ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>CURE. In a caſe ſo deſperate as this, without we can dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the violent force of the circulating fluids againſt the ſides of the veſſels, remove the obſtruction, and take off the congeſtion, and that ſoon, from the delicate texture of the brain, it muſt end
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:028021_0308_0FD672C34C43D8C8"/>
fatally—our applications, therefore, muſt not only be powerful in themſelves, but moſt expeditiouſly adminiſtered, with intent to divert the flow of blood from the head, at the ſame time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to allay the violence of vaſcular action, and ſtrengthen the veſſels of the part affected.</p>
                  <p>For theſe purpoſes, therefore, we ſhould have recourſe to bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—ſome adviſe in an erect poſture, copiouſly, and from a large orifice, till the patient faints, giving preference to the large vein of the neck, called jugular, or the temporal artery; or, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>DESCRIPTION. An inflammation of the more internal parts, attended in common with great pain, and that pulſatile, or throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing head-ach, and ſome ſlight feveriſhneſs; ſometimes when it affects in a more ſevere degree, the fever is ſtronger—the head more painful, accompanied with delirium.</p>

                  <p>CURE. When the affections are ſlight, a little warm oil, with a few drops of the tincture of opium, may be dropped into the ear—or a decoction of poppy heads may be injected—theſe will ſometimes take off the complaint when trifling:—but ſhould it be more ſevere, bleeding and purging may be requiſite—apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo cupping-glaſſes, or leeches behind the ears, and bliſters—bathing the feet alſo in warm water—and when the pain is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, an opiate, No. 4, may be adminiſtered at bed-time.</p>

                     </gap> in other complaints, we ſhall give of it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe view.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. This complaint at the beginning is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with heat, redneſs, and ſwelling, or fulneſs of the eye—and often feels as if a particle of ſand, or a ſmall fly, had got into it, and there fixed—the eye is painful, tears flow, which appear hot and ſcalding—the angles of the eye are often filled with a viſcid, yellowiſh matter, particularly after ſleeping—the ſight is weak, and all light is offenſive—<hi>in the more ſevere ſpecies,</hi> the pain is very acute—the pulſe quick and rather hard—the light intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—there is a perceptible pulſation of the arteries—and the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> parts, ſwell; but <hi>when it is ſtill more ſevere,</hi> the membrane covering the white of the eye elevates it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above the darker coloured part, called cornea, from its horny appearance—and the patients complain of flies flying before them, and feel other unpleaſant ſenſations of this kind, the effect of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.—Afterwards ſucceed ſuppurations, ſpiſſitude, of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours—ſpots upon, and thickneſs of the cornea itſelf.</p>
                  <p>From this account there appears to ariſe three material con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations: FIRST, whether it is ſlight, affecting only the veſſels of the outward membrane of the eye;—SECOND, whether it is very ſevere, extending itſelf to the eyelids, and their edges, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tarſi;—THIRD, whether it is extremely violent, fixing its feat in the internal veſſels of the eye itſelf, and in thoſe of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane called <hi>retina,</hi> at the bottom of the eye, which is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeat of viſion; in which caſe it is attended with high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fever, intolerable pain, and often delirium. For theſe diſtinctions will make ſome alterations in our modes of cure.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote,</hi> or <hi>inducing,</hi> are—external injuries occaſioned by blows—duſt getting into the eye, or other ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating bodies—a free admiſſion of cold wind—ſweats ſuddenly ſuppreſſed—looking frequently or long at the fire, the ſun, or other ſtrong glaring colours—expoſure to the cold air of the morning and evening, which ſucceeds hot and ſun-ſhiny weather—acrid and metalline fumes—couching, or extracting a cataract. It alſo may proceed from internal cauſes—ſuch as the ſuppreſſion of ſalutary evacuations—humors repelled—drying up of iſſues—
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:028021_0311_0FD6728FD447A680"/>
ſetons—fiſtulas—or ulcers—indigeſtion—too long watchings—night ſtudies—other diſeaſes of the eyes—ſmall-pox—and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Redneſs, and pain in the eye—with incapability of bearing the light.</p>
                  <p>CURE. With regard to this we are to take into our account the immediate cauſe—whether it is an increaſed irritability in the veſſels; or a want of proper reſiſtance in their coats; or they both co-operate together—for, according to the acting cauſe, ſo ſhould our applications differ; as what would in one caſe produce a good effect, would in the other be attended with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, or at leaſt diſagreeable effects.</p>
                  <p>In the ſlighter degrees of this complaint, the cure is perfectly eaſy, as little more is requiſite than external applications—waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eyes with warm milk and water, mixed with a little brandy—conſerve of roſes—roaſted apples, and ſome ſuch reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>But in more ſevere affections, if the habit is full, general bleeding and purgatives are neceſſary, with a cooling regimen—to which, if the diſorder does not ſoon give way, not leſs than three leeches ſhould be applied, as near each other as poſſible, in the hollow of the temple neareſt the eye affected—opening the jugular vein is often ſerviceable;—bleeding in the eye itſelf has by ſome been ſtrongly recommended; but the operation is apt to irritate, and is only neceſſary when the inflammation is kept up by a ſpeck in the eye, which is fed by one or more blood veſſels, then they may be divided.</p>
                  <p>In obſtinate caſes, keeping the head ſhaved is highly proper, and applying bliſters about the ſize of half a crown over the orifices made by the leeches, is uſeful;—bathing the feet in warm water ſhould not be neglected.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the local applications, the chief, and moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is the tinctura Thebaica of the London Pharmacopaeia as an opiate, joined with ſome ſtimulant, for without, it will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;—at firſt the anodyne eye-water (No. 91.) may be applied to the eye two or three times a day. In ſlight caſes, this is often ſufficient; and, indeed, in the more obſtinate, two or three drops of the tincture may be dropt into the eye two or three times a day.—The body ſhould be kept cool by proper diet and medicines, and the eyes free from any thing that can irritate them.</p>
                  <p>In ſome caſes, though, where the inflammation has been long continued, its duration will be apparently owing to want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſiſtance in the veſſels—hence muſt recourſe be had to ſuch medicines as give ſtrength and activity to them; ſtill ſome cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:028021_0312_0FD672CB173AABA8"/>
is here neceſſary—they ſhould only be applied when the eye is in the weakeſt ſtate of inflammation, which generally happens in the morning, after the eye has been kept ſome time free from any irritating cauſe.—In theſe caſes the coagulum aluminoſum of the old London Diſpenſatory may be mixed with a common poultice, and applied to the eye affected for three or four hours in a morning—and in the remainder of the day, tincture of opium—afterwards as the eye gets ſtrength the vitriolic ſolution, No. 92, may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>By this method I have ſeen inflammations of the eyes of long ſtanding, cured, which had reſiſted every other mode—the quantity of the vitriol may be gradually increaſed to 10 or 12 grains.</p>
                  <p>In all inflammations of the eyes ariſing from common cauſes, one of the modes above ſpecified will generally ſucceed—only we ſhould be careful not to uſe any of the more ſtimulant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, till the inflammation begins to relax of its violence, for if they are uſed too ſoon, they will rather increaſe, than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the malady.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes this diſeaſe will be occaſioned, and ſupported by ſome morbid humour in the habit—as that called ſcrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous—venereal—or ſome other which we are incapable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering.—In the two former caſes, we muſt make uſe of thoſe remedies pointed out in the treatment of thoſe complaints—in the latter, a courſe of alteratives in which mercury has the greateſt ſhare, will be moſt efficacious. Under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have known ſmall doſes of calomel, with antimonial powder and rhubarb, or jalap, given twice a day, and waſhed down with the decoction of the woods, interpoſing proper pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives once in a week or ten days, be very ſucceſsful—and greatly aſſiſt the application of external remedies.</p>
                  <p>In obſtinate caſes, where bliſters have been ineffectual—iſſues, and ſetons in the neck, have been recommended;—or having the lobes of the ears pierced, and exciting a diſcharge by ſkains of ſilk being paſſed through them in the manner of ſetons.</p>
                  <p>The gluing of the eyelids together, ſhould be prevented by inſinuating a little mild unctuous medicine between them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the patient goes to reſt.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding what has been ſaid reſpecting inflammation of the eyes reſulting from a relaxation, or attended by that ſtate of the veſſels, it is ſometimes owing to intenſeneſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—which is diſcoverable from <hi>the great heat,—dryneſs,</hi> and <hi>very ſevere pain,</hi>—which are concomitants;—then bathing the eye with warm milk and water, in which poppy heads have been boiled, afterwards applying a poultice of this decoction

But in order to prevent the acceſſion of theſe complaints in thoſe who are ſubject to the returns, beſides guarding againſt the remote cauſes (315.) iſſues have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended—taking away blood about the equinoxes—purging occaſionally—a cooling diet—avoiding reading in the night, particularly ſmall print—or, in fine, doing any thing, that can too much fatigue the eyes.</p>

                     <head>THE TONSILLARY INFLAMMATORY QUINSY, OR COMMON SORE THROAT.</head>
                     <p>DESCRIPTION. In this the tonſils and ſuperior part of the fauces are affected—in general the inflammation begins in one tonſil, then ſpreads acroſs the palate, ſeizes the uvula, and other tonſil.</p>
                     <p>Though conſiderable pain attends the action of ſwallowing if only one ſide of the fauces is affected, yet can that action be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed tolerably well; but the pain becomes intolerably ſevere when both ſides are affected, and ſwallowing is performed with extreme difficulty; indeed, the pain is ſometimes ſo great as, in delicate and irritable habits, to occaſion convulſions.</p>
                     <p>It may, however, appear ſingular, that more pain ſhould be felt in ſwallowing liquids than ſolids; but this is the fact, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a greater portion of muſcular fibres are employed in the deglutition of the former than the latter.</p>
                     <p>So long as the inflammation confines itſelf to the parts above deſcribed there is little danger, more particularly if the neck appears puffed up, for this ſeems to indicate leſs danger of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation, and is therefore conſidered a favourable omen.</p>
                     <p>But if the inflammation extends itſelf to the muſcles of the larynx, in that degree as to impede the opening of the glottis, or ſuperior part of the windpipe, the complaint becomes extremely precarious, becauſe then there will be great apprehenſion of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation.</p>
                     <p>Or ſhould the brain or lungs be affected by a tranſlation of the morbid matter, from the one occaſioning violent head-ach and ſtrong delirium; and from the other oppreſſion of the cheſt and difficulty of breathing. If to what we have here ſaid we add the febrile ſymptoms which commonly attend inflammation, and the
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:028021_0315_0FD6729371F0D5F8"/>
apppearances in the throat, (315.) we cannot avoid diſtinguiſhing the complaints.</p>
                     <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, perſpiration obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, particularly in the neck—the admiſſion of cold air into the fauces, eſpecially if it ruſhes rapidly into the mouth, and ſtrikes them forcibly—violent and long continued ſinging—ſhouting, or too ſevere exerciſe of the part—any acrid ſtimulating particles, or hard pungent bodies adhering to the parts—drinking too cold water—ſuppreſſed or impeded evacuations—or a peculiar ſtate of the air rendering this complaint epidemical.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> ſimilar to thoſe of other inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory complaints.</p>
                     <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Redneſs, tumor, heat, of the tonſils, rendering deglutition painful, attended with febrile inflammatory ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>CURE. The ſame rules are to be obſerved as in other inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, reſpecting the general treatment, ſuch as bleeding, purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cooling, diluting medicines, and regimen. With regard to local application, it is of uſe to apply ſtupes of flannel dipped in ſpirits of ſal ammoniac, or hartſhorn, mixed with a little oil, and applied to the throat in the ſlighter caſes—in the more ſevere, bliſters; for theſe ſolicit the matter from the internal to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts.</p>
                     <p>Gargles alſo of ſage tea and vinegar, or infuſions of elder and chamomile flowers, in equal parts of water and vinegar, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſteams of this to the throat; they are of infinite uſe, and give great relief, favouring the exudation and diſſipation of the obſtructing fluids.</p>
                     <p>After the imflammation is abated, gargles more aſtringent ſhould be uſed, made of tincture of roſes, or red port, with the vitriolic or muriatic acid, ſweetened with honey—alſo to them may be added a ſmall portion of alum, or weak decoctions of bark, with the acids above-mentioned, or alum; for theſe will give ſtrength to the fibres, which, from over diſtenſion, have been weakened and relaxed—and, for gargling the throat, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſyringes had better be made uſe of, both on account of eaſe and certainty in reaching the part affected.</p>
                     <p>By this mode the cure in common will be completed within the courſe of four or five days; but if within this time the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ſymptoms ſhould not become <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>When the abſceſs is perceptible to the ſight, and within the reach of external remedies, this method muſt be purſued; but ſometimes it forms itſelf ſo low down as not to be within the reach of inſtruments; we muſt therefore wait for its burſting; and ſhould, before this happens, the tumor be ſo large as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſwallowing, the patient muſt be ſupported by broth or milk glyſters; and bliſters and ſtimulant poultices ſhould be applied to the throat externally, in order to ſolicit the morbid matter outwardly.</p>
                     <p>The conſequences in theſe caſes is very rarely fatal, when there is a ſuppuration; however alarming may be the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, or tedious the proceſs.</p>
                     <p>But, now and then, this complaint ariſes from the want of proper reſiſtance in the veſſels of thoſe parts, diſcoverable by the relaxed ſtate of the ſolids, manifeſted <hi>by weaker degrees of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>In theſe caſes copious bleeding is rarely neceſſary; purgatives are more to be depended upon, and the application of ſtimulants and bliſters locally and externally—gargles ſhould be of the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent kind, made of the infuſion of horſe radiſh, or muſtard ſeed, or ſome other of the pungent ſtimulants, (145, 146.) for theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the viſcid mucus which clogs the follicles or cells of the tonſils, and other contiguous glandular parts, that crowd the fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by ſtimulating the veſſels to an increaſe of proper action on their ſtagnating mucus; for theſe ſore throats are conſidered as pituitous.</p>
                     <p>In habits like theſe of the phlegmatic kind, (60.) abſceſſes ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ariſe; but ſhould that be the caſe, they require the ſame mode of treatment as above ſpecified; to which muſt be added tonic and corroborant medicines internally, as well as externally, in order to give tone and firmneſs to the veſſels after proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergents,
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:028021_0317_0FD67294B47AB528"/>
and add ſtrength to the conſtitution, as bark, ſteel, with it generous and nutritious diet.</p>
                     <p>The ſame mode muſt be purſued in the SECOND and THIRD SPECIES, in their inflammatory ſtate; to which if the diſeaſe does not yield, and there is reaſon to be afraid of ſuffocation, from the high degree of inflammation of the muſcles of the larynx, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting proper reſpiration, recourſe muſt be had to bronchotomy, or opening the windpipe, though not without extreme neceſſity, and then it muſt be performed by the hands of the moſt ſkilful ſurgeon, for it is attended with the utmoſt danger.</p>
                     <p>But ſometimes the inflammation not only attacks the membrane lining the upper part of the trachea, but extends itſelf down on the interior ſurface into the lungs, which ſurface is found, on diſſection, to be covered over, and the paſſage for the air almoſt filled up with a thick ſlough, having a fibrous membrane-like appearance, which is concluded to be the viſcid remains of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus thrown off by exudation from the inflamed ſurfaces—and is diſcoverable by a <hi>peculiar ſhrillneſs of the voice, like the crowing of the cock, with a cough,</hi> but no ſickneſs, nor at firſt much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing.</p>
                     <p>This diſeaſe is at certain times epidemic, and ſeizes chiefly children, and runs to its fatal termination ſo extremely rapid, that little chance is given to any medical applications, from the want of time—immediate vomiting, and bliſtering the throat, are the whole we can, perhaps, depend upon for any the leaſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſucceſs.

                     <p>But there is a ſingular peculiarity now and then attending this complaint; for ſometimes on the ſwelling of the glands ſubſiding, a ſimilar affection of the teſticles of men takes place, and of the breaſts in women—however, no alteration in the cure is required;

                  <p>This has often raged in England, and appears to be a quinſy, or ſore throat, of a more malignant nature, attended with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent fever, verging more to the putreſcent than inflammatory ſort; or running very rapidly from the former into the latter.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe oftener attacks, and with a greater degree of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, infants and young children than adults; girls than boys; the infirm than thoſe in the vigour of health; thoſe of a pale, wan complexion, and relaxed habit, with an acrimonious ſtate of fluids, than the robuſt and ſanguineous; and appears particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in autumn, preceded by a hot ſummer.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. In its commencement, it firſt ſeizes the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient with <hi>chillneſs, languor, ſickneſs, and extreme oppreſſion at the pit of the ſtomach—great dejection of ſpirits—very ſudden weakneſs—great heavineſs on the breaſt—and faintneſs</hi>—theſe are ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>extreme heat, nauſea, vomiting, with ſoreneſs of the throat</hi>—ſometimes the affection of the throat makes the firſt appearance—in general the <hi>pulſe</hi> is frequent, ſmall, and fluttering, though ſometimes depreſſed, and undulating—the <hi>tongue</hi> moiſt, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the root—the <hi>eyes</hi> heavy, reddiſh, and watery—the <hi>countenance</hi> frequently full, fluſhed, and bloated, though now and then pale and ſunk—the <hi>breathing</hi> quick and laborious—the <hi>ſkin,</hi> though extremely hot, not perfectly dry—the <hi>urine</hi> commonly pale, thin, and crude; in many adults, however, it will be made in ſmall quantities, high coloured, or turbid like whey—the <hi>throat</hi> ſore and inflamed, exhibiting a ſhining redneſs, of a deeper colour than in common inflammatory ſore throats, and having a puffy appearance which covered the tonſils, and ſpread over the fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the <hi>tonſils</hi> at the ſame time ulcerated, and in ſome degree, though not greatly, enlarged—a <hi>delirium</hi> ſometimes comes on in the day-time, the ſymptoms appearing ſlight; yet is there in the night a conſiderable increaſe of violence, and that through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe—the <hi>ſwallowing</hi> is difficult, and more ſo on ſwallowing the ſaliva only, than of any liquid or ſoft diet.</p>
                  <p>On the third day, or thereabouts, an effloreſcence on the ſkin generally appears, but without any alleviation of the diſtreſſing
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:028021_0319_0FD67296374EB100"/>
ſymptoms; indeed, they frequently increaſe, and, added to them there is often a <hi>purging</hi>—at this time the patient begins to <hi>throw about his arms and legs,</hi> lying in a ſtate of great inquietude; or he becomes <hi>drowſy</hi>—there now comes on <hi>great proſtration of ſtrength—the conſtitutional powers fail—ſwallowing</hi> grows more difficult—the <hi>breathing</hi> more laborious—and before the ſixth day the patient expires in a ſtate of ſuffocation.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> and <hi>inducing,</hi> as in all diſeaſes ariſing from any ſpecific infection, or contagion, is a prediſpoſition in the habit to receive and feel the effects of the morbid matter, which we conceive to be of a peculiar nature capable of creating the diſeaſe, communicated from the air, or bodies before affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which conſtitutes the <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> cauſe; for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the diſeaſe, either from the breath, or contaminated mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpit up, will attack the attendants, and a whole family—a ſtrong proof that the diſeaſe is infectious and contagious.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. (See page 319.) And here it is of the utmoſt conſequence to diſtinguiſh this from the ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflammatory ſore throat, which may be done by the looſeneſs and vomiting—the puffy and dark-coloured redneſs attending the ſwelling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the foetid ulcers of the throat, covered with a white ſlough—from the hoarſeneſs of the voice—the ſlight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium coming on ſo ſoon—and from the ſudden and great proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of ſtrength—becauſe much depends upon the mode of cure firſt adopted—for what will be the means of laying a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a cure in the ſimple inflammatory, would be the cauſe of death in the malignant quinſy.</p>
                  <p>The redneſs of the tumefied parts, brightneſs of the eyes, no great degrees of debility and fainting, the ſlough being white, and the florid appearance of the eruption on the ſkin, are favourable omens.</p>
                  <p>But if the debility ſhould be violent; if the ulcers are aſh-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, black, or livid; if there ſhould be a diarrhoea, rigor, weak and ſmall pulſe; the body put on a cadaverous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the eyes loſe their ſplendour; the eruptions diſappear, or become livid; and particularly if the noſe bleeds—the worſt muſt be expected.</p>
                  <p>CURE. The indications of cure are ſimilar to thoſe of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid fever, (223, &amp;c.) to which we muſt add, the healing of the ulcers.</p>
                  <p>In the moſt malignant kind, little can be expected from our endeavours, the progreſs to diſſolution is ſo rapid.</p>
                  <p>In the more mild ſort, whatever may have been ſaid by men whoſe medical characters entitle them to attention, with reſpect to bleeding, nothing except the moſt diſtreſſing inflammatory ſymptoms, which rarely occur but at the commencement, can

authoriſe the practice; for I have generally obſerved, that thoſe who have undergone the operation in this ſpecies of fever, ran <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Or the vehicle to the other ingredients may be pectoral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction; the more antiſeptic ones may be made of decoctions of bark, with tincture of myrrh, red port, and the mineral acid—ſome adviſe a gargle made of honey, barley-water, and ſpirit of ſea ſalt—and after the fever has remitted, drying the ulcer with quick-lime ley mixed with honey.</p>

                  <head>§ 1. PLEURISY, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE PLEURA.</head>
                  <p>THIS is an affection of that membrane called PLEURA from the Greek word <hi>pleos,</hi> plenus, full, which lines the inſide of the cheſt, covering the ribs internally, and intercoſtal muſcles (33.) and lungs, (28.) and forming the mediaſtinum and pericar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, (28.) attended with an acute fever, great pain, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing.</p>
                  <p>It is divided into the TRUE PLEURISY, when the membrane itſelf is affected—into the SPURIOUS, when the intercoſtal muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and alſo into MOIST, when expectoration is an aſſociate; and DRY, when there is no ſuch appearance—indeed, at the onſet it puts on generally the appearance of the latter, and of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in its progreſs, if not conquered by reſolution; for then moſt commonly expectoration takes place.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. At the commencement, the patient is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally attacked with chillneſs and ſhivering, which are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by heat, reſtleſſneſs, pain in the head and ſide, the laſt
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:028021_0321_0FD672987137DA80"/>
very acute and pungent, running to the back and collar-bone—difficulty of lying on the ſide affected, with a dry cough, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the pain, which, after the third day, is attended with an expectoration of a thin, ſanious, and ſometimes bloody mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—the breathing is alſo very difficult and painful—the pulſe hard and tenſe—the blood, when drawn, firm in its texture, and covered with a coriaceous, or ſubſtance like buff-leather—the urine very high coloured—and all the ſymptoms of a peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which we ſhall hereafter deſcribe.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, obſtructed or imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſpiration—ſtrong exerciſe, cold, thick, heavy air admitted into the lungs, cold northerly winds—drinking of ardent ſpirits—cold water drank when the body is over-heated. Sometimes it ſucceeds a quinſy, colic, and ſpaſmodic pains—ſuppreſſed eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations—eruptions repelled, as the meazles and ſmall-pox, &amp;c.—external injuries of the cheſt—and, in fine, whatever will cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a ſtimulus on the lungs poſſeſſed of an inflammatory diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> an inflammation of the pleura run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning along the exterior ſurface of the lungs, or that part cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ribs; but moſt frequently of <hi>both</hi> affected at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A pungent pain of the ſide, attended with febrile affections, pain alſo in inſpiration particularly increaſed; a difficulty of lying down, for the moſt part on the ſide affected; and very painful cough—in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dry, afterwards moiſt, and often bloody.</p>
                  <p>CURE. The indications are ſimilar to thoſe of inflammation of other parts—at the onſet, we muſt have recourſe to copious bleeding, and that repeated, if the ſymptoms continue urgent, according to the ſtrength of the patient—the blood ſhould be taken from a large orifice; and in ſtrong full habits, and young up-grown ſubjects, not leſs than fourteen or ſixteen ounces—above the part in pain cupping-glaſſes may be applied, and blood taken away by thoſe means—if the pain ſhould be relieved by the firſt bleeding for ſome hours; and, notwithſtanding <hi>that,</hi> the pain and oppreſſion return, the operation muſt be repeated, and about twelve ounces more blood taken away; and, indeed, ſhould the ſymptoms prove obſtinate; and return in the courſe of ten or twelve hours, we muſt have recourſe to the operation again, and apply a bliſter over the part affected, eſpecially if the inflammation appears to extend itſelf outwardly, or the pain has any great degree of ſeverity; for, indeed, our chief dependence reſts on bleeding and local bliſtering, to weaken the tone of the vaſcular ſyſtem, and ſubdue the violence of the action of the
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:028021_0322_0FD672CF3B7FE730"/>
veſſels—after the firſt bleeding, and in the intermediate times, ſuch things ſhould be adminiſtered as will co-operate to promote theſe intentions—we muſt, therefore, have recourſe to ſuch things as are diluting, relaxing, and emollient, with cooling and aperient diuretics—hence may the patient drink copiouſly of <hi>pectoral decoction, bran or linſeed tea, almond milk, apple-water, lemonade;</hi> in all which portions of nitre may be diſſolved; and the body ſhould be kept open with <hi>cooling and relaxing glyſters,</hi> (No. 25, 26.)—<hi>a large ſpunge dipped in warm vinegar</hi> applied to the mouth and noſtrils is uſeful, as well as diluting drinks, that the vapors may be received with the air into the lungs, relax the pores of the pulmonary veſicles, promote exudation, and bring on expectoration, by unloading the diſtended blood-veſſels, and making them permeable—or, for this purpoſe, the <hi>ſteams of warm water, or ſome emollient decoction,</hi> might be received into the lungs by inhaling them from the ſpout of a large tea-pot; or by MUDGE's inhaler, contrived for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Emollient fomentations,</hi> or <hi>hags filled with boiled herbs,</hi> might be applied over the parts—<hi>oily medicines,</hi> forming emulſions or linctus's, (No. 81 to 84.) might be taken internally occaſionally—and <hi>nitre,</hi> mixed <hi>with a little camphor,</hi> or <hi>antimonials</hi>—and <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line mixtures</hi> given every two, three, or four hours.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this diſeaſe, there is little doubt but this, like other inflammations, may be carried off by reſolution; but if the power and ſtrength of the veſſels have been ſo weakened, or there has been a plentiful depoſition of morbid matter upon the lungs, which has changed the nature of the pulmonary fluids, we muſt then endeavour to promote, by all means, expectoration, as the only remaining means of ſaving the patient from extreme diſtreſs, or death.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe, added to what we have above delivered, as an attenuant, ſeneka, or-rattleſnake-root, (159.) is eſteemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> expectoration; but when we find the latter is remiſs, expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants muſt be had recourſe to, (No. 95.) four ſpoonfuls of which muſt be taken every third or fourth hour.</p>
                  <p>When people begin to expectorate, ſome authors forbid any farther uſe of the lancet; <hi>but ſo long as the violence of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms go on to increaſe,</hi> we may purſue it to a fourth or fifth time; nay, indeed, farther, according to the ſtrength, till we find theſe alleviated, and the patient perceives himſelf conſiderably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                  <p>This alleviation will be perceptible on the fourth or fifth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the cough will be leſs troubleſome; the breathing not ſo difficult; the expectoration more eaſy; the matter leſs tinged with blood; and by ſome alleviation and freedom in the pulſe, which will beat more regularly, and with more quietude.</p>
                  <p>Under theſe circumſtances, we ſhould perſiſt in the uſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luents and expectorants, keeping the body open with gentle ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartics, ſuch as the electarium e caſſia, oil of caſtor, manna, Rochelle ſalt, &amp;c. (169 to 171.) or by the uſe of emollient gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters—deſiſting now from farther bleeding.</p>
                  <p>Though the diſeaſe in a few days generally terminates favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, if the expectoration continues free and copious, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſtops ſuddenly, and no other diſcharge ſucceeding, the breathing becomes difficult and laborious; we muſt then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to renew the diſcharge, leſt the patient ſhould die ſuffocated, by <hi>bleeding, inhaling warm ſteams into the lungs, the application of bliſters, and antimonials,</hi> ſufficient to promote gentle vomiting.</p>
                  <p>As the mode of treatment muſt be ſimilar in the ſimple inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the lungs, heart, mediaſtinum, pericardium, and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm, (28, 29. 33.) we ſhall now only deſcribe them, to ſhew how they may be diſcovered—and, firſt,</p>

                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing,</hi> (ſee page 325.) <hi>Proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> inflammatory obſtructions of the terminations of thoſe arteries of lungs, (30.) called pulmonary and bronchial, either ſeparately or conjointly.</p>

CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Febrile affections, attended with an obtuſe pain under the breaſtbone, or betwixt the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders—anxiety, and difficulty of breathing—a cough, generally, though not always, moiſt—the face ſwelled, and of a purpliſh colour.</p>
                  <p>CURE. (See Pleuriſy, page 326.) But here it may not be uſeleſs to obſerve, that there ſeems to be a material alteration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the termination of an inflammation of the pleura and that of the lungs—the ſolution <hi>of the firſt</hi> often happens by a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſweat, or a copious diſcharge of loaded urine—<hi>of the laſt,</hi> more frequently by expectoration—and in both caſes, when theſe evacuations of ſweat, urine, or expectoration have been perfect, a full and ſalutary criſis is formed, all the oppreſſive ſymptoms vaniſh gradually, and the re-eſtabliſhment of health happily ſucceeds.</p>
                  <p>The inflammation of the mediaſtinum, which is only a dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature of the pleura, manifeſts itſelf by an acute pain in the middle of the breaſt, between the breaſt-bone and the ſpine, or clavicles or collar-bones, attended with frequent and quick breathing, and the reſt of the pleuritic ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>inflammation of the heart, and the membrane ſurrounding the heart,</hi> is accompanied with a deep-ſeated pain—weight, anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety—very quick, and frequent reſpiration—great thirſt—a heat in the cheſt—palpitation of the heart—with a hard and unequal pulſe, and frequent fainting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſame affection making the diaphragm, or that part of the pleura which covers it,</hi> (27.) <hi>the ſeat,</hi> has for its attendant ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, an acute fever—reſtleſſneſs—anxiety—and delirium—an acute pain between the ſpurious or ſhort ribs, and the vertebrae of the back places oppoſite to them, agreeable to its ſituation—the breathing is quick and ſhort, accompanied with convulſive catchings in inſpiration—a dry cough and hiccough—the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondrium, or part below the ſhort ribs is drawn in towards the back, and the abdomen, or lower belly, has little or no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion during the action of breathing.</p>
                  <p>The three complaints we have now mentioned are called by ſyſtematic writers, CARDITIS, from <hi>cardia,</hi> cor, the heart—PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICARDITIS, from <hi>peri,</hi> circum, about, and <hi>cardia,</hi>—and PARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHRENITIS, in contradiſtinction to <hi>phrenitis,</hi> or the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the brain, becauſe, though a delirium always attends it, the brain is only ſympathetically affected in this caſe, whilſt in the PHRENITIS it is the ſeat of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the cure, we muſt purſue the ſame plan as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed in pleuriſy, exerting our ſtrongeſt efforts to produce reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, the only ſalutary termination; for all the other either
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:028021_0325_0FD672A18B8D36E0"/>
bring on immediate death, or lay the foundation for ſome irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable complaint, of which we ſhall treat, as ſoon as we have taken notice of another ſpecies of the peripneumony; for in this place we have confined ourſelves to ſuch as were purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory.</p>

                  <head>MALIGNANT PERIPNEUMONY.</head>
                  <p>This complaint is by far more dangerous than that we have before deſcribed—as it generally attacks thoſe where humors are in an highly acrimonious ſtate, ſcorbutic habits, and ſailors after long voyages.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. In this complaint, the blood is in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſtate, livid, and when drawn has no coriaceous, or leather-like appearance upon its ſurface, as in the inflammatory ſpecies—there is alſo great reſtleſſneſs with extreme debility;—pains all over the body;—profuſe ſweats, and red, or livid eruptions, like flea-bites;—the patients are apt to faint on the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have a difficulty of breathing, and cough or ſpit up a thin, ſanious, bloody matter, which ſmells offenſively—the pulſe is ſoft, and depreſſed, and the urine very high coloured.</p>
                  <p>CURE. The fever attendant on this ſeems clearly to be of the putrid kind, and as ſuch muſt be treated—Bleeding, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt be avoided, without at the beginning the pulſe ſhould be ſtrong, for otherwiſe it does great injury, particularly if it ſhould be repeated. Bliſters alſo are miſchievous.—Our chief dependence reſts upon <hi>vegetable or mineral acids—camphorated vinegar,</hi> (No. 55.) with a <hi>nouriſhing and aceſcent diet—vinous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids,</hi> particularly ſuch as are aſtringent, the beſt of which are rheniſh, claret, and red port—<hi>Opiates</hi> alſo have been found ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in thickening and rendering more mild the thin, acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious humours depoſited upon the lungs; but then they ſhould be given with great caution, taking care not to increaſe the difficulty of breathing by their uſe.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>ſpurious peripneumony</hi> we ſhall take notice, when we come to treat on aſthma; and now proceed to treat on ſome of the conſequences of pleuritie and other inflammatory affections of the breaſt, forming different diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>For when the pleuriſy, or peripneumony is not cured by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, or expectoration, matter is generally formed within the cheſt, which, according to its ſituation, has received differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent appellations; when in the body of the lungs, though no more than an abſceſs, it is called VOMICA—from <hi>vomo,</hi> to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, becauſe they vomit forth, as it were, matter—when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the pleura, EMPYEMA, from <hi>en</hi> and <hi>puon,</hi> pus, matter.</p>

Upon the formation of matter, which, occurs, if the inflammation goes not off within fourteen days, there is an abatement of the ſeverity of the ſymptoms—the pain ceaſes—and the pulſe, ſtill quick, is weaker and ſofter; yet the cough, difficulty of breathing, and oppreſſion ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue—and if in this ſituation the patient feels a ſlight ſhivering, ſucceeded by heat, little doubt remains of an abſceſs taking place;—add to this, if the cough increaſes upon the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the patient cannot lie but on the ſide affected, and the ſymptoms grow daily more ſevere, accompanied with debility, and emaciation, theſe appearances make it more certain—And ſhould the vomica burſt ſuddenly, a ſuffocation may be dreaded—or ſhould the matter not find its way into the branches of the windpipe, ſo that it may be coughed up, and make its exit out of the habit, all hopes of ſucceſs are at an end.</p>

                     <p>CURE. In both theſe caſes every proſpect of ſucceſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon freeing the habit from the offenſive matter, which, ſhould we not be able to accompliſh, either the patient will die ſuffocated—or conſumptive. In an EMPYEMA there are no hopes, except making an aperture between the ribs into the cheſt, as low as poſſible, to avoid wounding the diaphragm.</p>
                     <p>In a VOMICA, if from the expectoration of matter we have reaſon to believe that it has burſt into the branches of the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, and the matter be white, ſmooth, and free from any offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſmell, and continue to be freely diſcharged; if all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive ſymptoms from day to day abate, particularly the cough and laborious breathing, we muſt not deſpair of a recovery, which we muſt endeavour to promote by the uſe of expectorant balſamics conveying the ſteams of the aetherial ſpirit of vitriol—or STERNE's aether dropt into hot water, and inhaled into the lungs, in order to cleanſe and heal the ulcer.</p>

Ground ivy, hyſſop, chervil tea, whey, ſweetened with honey, are proper drinks—all animal food and broths ſhould be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their place ſupplied with milk—rice, ſpinage, turnips, or any other diluent, cooling vegetables, properly prepared: theſe will keep the body cool, and diſpoſe the humours to be mild and ſoft—and proceed farther in the manner we have laid down in pulmonary conſumption.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes matter will be ſo ſituated by being locked up in a ſac, whoſe ſides are formed ſo thick, that the matter cannot be abſorbed into the habit, but communicating with the branches of the windpipe, be from time to time expectorated—under this circumſtance men will live a long time, as I have in two inſtances known, where nothing was ever attempted but putting the patients on a milk diet.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes an adheſion will be formed between the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane covering the outer ſurface of the lungs and the pleura which covers the inſide of the ribs, forming a cavity, and points itſelf outwardly; or manifeſts itſelf by a conſtant fixed pain in ſome particular part—under theſe circumſtances, when all hopes of a cure by expectoration are paſt the vomicae and ulcers have been conquered effectually by an aperture being made into the cyſt in which the matter was lodged.

                  <head>§ 3. PULMONARY CONSUMPTION,</head>
                  <p>called PHTHISIS PULMONALIS, from the Greek word <hi>pthino</hi> or <hi>pthuo,</hi> corrumpo, to corrupt.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe is a waſting away of the whole body, attended with a hectic fever, cough, and ſpitting up of matter, from an ulcer on the lungs.</p>
                  <p>Authors have divided them into different ſpecies; THE DRY, or TUBERCULOUS CONSUMPTION;—THE MOIST, or CATARR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAL—and THE SANGUINARY, from their attendant ſymptoms and cauſes; but by dividing this diſeaſe into two ſtages, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to the cauſe, we ſhall, by a conciſe view, render it leſs perplexing; the FIRST, compriſing its ſtate of inflammation; the SECOND, of ſuppuration.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. The inflammatory ſtage begins with chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſucceeded by heat, low ſpiritedneſs, and pain—ſhrillneſs of the voice, ſalt taſte in the mouth, and dry cough—there is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an oppreſſion in the breaſt, eſpecially after motion—thirſt—a 
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:028021_0328_0FD672D90537F3E8"/>
weight in that part of the lungs affected—loſs of appetite, and vomiting up ſometimes of the food ſoon after taking it—the pulſe is quick, ſoft, and ſmall; ſometimes full, and rather hard—and frequently a ſpitting and coughing up of frothy and florid blood—this forms the firſt ſpecies—and when blood is coughed up, the third, or ſanguinary; and this by ſome is conſidered as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in its incipient ſtate.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time, matter is expectorated of different colours, white, yellow, green, bloody, either without ſmell, or offenſive—the body begins to fall away, and grows cold even in ſummer—the hectic fever increaſes in the evening, and in the morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates by diſſolving ſweats—there is a burning heat frequently in the palms of the hands—and in the day looſeneſſes come on, or the patient makes a larger quantity of water—ſometimee the tongue will be beſet with ſmall ulcers—and, after eating, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will have a fixed red colour in his cheeks—the fingers grow thin, though the ends are bulbous, and nails curve inwardly—the feet ſwell—the hair falls off—and pit of the ſtomach ſeems to be pulled inwards and upwards—all the functions grow languid—the body dry—and the eyes ſink deep within their cavities—at length, from debility, the patient pays the debt of nature, at the time when he is flattering himſelf with the hopes of a recovery.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, acrid matters ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the lungs, and, by their ſtimulus, exciting a cough—ſmall glandular tumors, called tubercles—fumes of arſenic, or other noxious materials, getting upon the lungs—moiſt air—ſpitting of blood—a diminution or ſuppreſſion of evacuations to which the conſtitution is accuſtomed—inordinate paſſion—ſedentary mode of life—too luxurious living—extraneous bodies getting into the lungs—wounds—retropulſion of acrimonious humours—beſides, it is occaſioned very often by a variety of other diſeaſes; as ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula, pox, ſmall-pox, meazles, ſcurvy, aſthma, pleuriſy, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripneumonic diſeaſes; ſcarlet fever, and other continued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent fevers; beſides, it may by contagion be acquired; and is alſo hereditary.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> is, <hi>in the firſt ſtage,</hi> an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſtate of ſome portions of the lungs, particularly the glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; <hi>in the ſecond,</hi> almoſt always ulcerations, which the opening of dead bodies who have died of this complaint verify; though ſometimes the cauſe has been found to be, an induration and ſwelling of the bronchial glands, which are diſperſed through the lungs, hard and black, not ſuppurated in the center, but running together, and firm, of the ſize of hazle-nuts or nutmegs, and ooz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a purulent mucus into the terminations and branches of the windpipe, not obſervable in the ſpits—ſome of them form

earthy concretions, do not ſuppurate kindly, but remain in a ſtate of hardneſs, and, when cut, ooze out a thick purulent mucus, and thick black blood.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Now, whether we conſider them as different ſpecies, or as different ſtages of the ſame complaint, we muſt adapt our mode of cure accordingly—hence, then, IN THE FIRST STAGE, we muſt endeavour to conquer the inflammation, by gentle bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, renewed at proper intervals, and the applications of bliſters to the back and ſides, frequently repeated; we ſhould alſo give oleaginous and incraſſating demulcents, to ſheath the humours, and prevent the coughing—gentle vomits ſhould be, after proper evacuations, repeatedly had recourſe to, at leaſt every morning, by giving a few grains of ipecacuanha, white or blue vitriol; though the firſt is preferable—a courſe of goat's whey would be uſeful—living upon vegetable diet, and being extremely tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate—when the inflammation abates, gentle doſes of ſome deob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ents; ſuch as ammoniacum, millipedes, myrrh, ammoniacal iron, &amp;c. would be ſerviceable to ſome; to others Seltzer water; thoſe of Moſſat, Harrowgate, Kilburn, Iſlington, to others; uſing at the ſame time riding exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>Small doſes of mercury have been thought efficacious in reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tubercles after the inflammatory ſtage is over, of which quickſilver with chalk, by ſome, has been preferred to every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compoſition of that claſs; but, whatever of them are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered, ſhould be given in ſmall doſes, in proportion to their activity.</p>
                  <p>IN THE SECOND STAGE, the indications are, to diſcharge the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive matter from the conſtitution by expectoration, or any other mode agreeable to nature, permitting her always to point the way; heal the ulcerations, ſtrengthen the lungs, and give tone and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the habit in general; for which purpoſes chalybeate waters, mineral acids, particularly elixir of vitriol, have been recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; gentle exerciſe, eſpecially riding on horſeback; a clear, dry, warm air, and ſuch amuſements and company as will moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhilirate, not fatigue the ſpirits—venery, all painful mental affections, or too great ſolicitude about buſineſs, ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>
                  <p>In order to clear the lungs, and produce freedom of expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we adviſe gentle emetics, (ſee above.) and failing, for theſe are greatly conducive towards giving ſtrength to the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—the myrrh mixture, (No. 96.) has been in many caſes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable—and, in order to prevent the abſorption of matter from having any bad effect upon the blood, <hi>antiſeptics,</hi> not of the ſtimulating kind; and <hi>demulcents,</hi> with vegetable and mineral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids, ſhould be uſed, if the patient has no looſeneſs to forbid their
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:028021_0330_0FD672DA9B5F7240"/>
adminiſtration—<hi>bark</hi> alſo in this point is beneficial—at the ſame time the patient ſhould be kept on all ſuch things as are cooling and nutritious, and what we comprehend under the term milk diet—and if neither riding exerciſe or failing can be procured, <hi>ſwinging</hi> in the open air muſt be ſubſtituted in their places.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more neceſſary than an exact obſervance of regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in point of diet in theſe conſumptive caſes; but of this, and other particulars, we have before ſpoken when on hectic fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to the cure of which we ſhall refer our reader, (261, &amp;c.) and proceed to treat on ſome other ſpecies of conſumptions, which ariſe not from affections of the lungs, but from matter formed in ſome other of the viſcera, and theſe are called</p>

                     <p>If it happens in the LIVER, it is known by pain extending it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to the ſhoulders—a ſwelling, and pain on touching the region of the part affected—nauſea, vomiting, and looſeneſs—there is frequently a cough—the ſkin has a ſallow or yellowiſh look—and the ſediment in the urine is either brown or yellow.</p>
                     <p>If in the STOMACH, it manifeſts itſelf by foetid offenſive belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings—a cough without expectoration—a vomiting of purulent matter—fainting frequently—ſweats—and pain, either during the time of ſwallowing, or juſt after.</p>
                     <p>If in the INTESTINES, it is diſcoverable from the ſituation of the parts, and the ſeparation of matter by ſtool.</p>
                     <p>If in the MESENTERY, the ſigns are nearly ſimilar to thoſe which occur when in the liver, (ſee above) though a hectic fever, joined to a tenſe ſwelling of the belly, and a frequent diarrhoea, are diſtinguiſhing marks of this diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>If in the KIDNEYS, there is a weight in the part affected, the patient lies on his belly, the urine has matter mixed with it, and there is a difficulty and pain in making water.</p>

                     <p>CURE; This, in all caſes of their kind, is to be attempted, by ſteel medicines, or waters, goat's whey, foſſile alkali, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, (Page 185.) or ſuch of the mineral waters as abound with them, joined to aſs' milk—deobſtruent gums, particularly myrrh, ammoniacum, with ſoap, and preparations of ſteel, rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, and tartarized kali, may, when opening medicines are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, be given; and, with the uſe of theſe, a milk diet ſhould be perſiſted in, with great regularity.</p>

CURE.

                  <p>DESCRIPTION. In this complaint the GENERAL SYMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOMS are, extreme anxiety—watchings—reſtleſſneſs—toſſing about of the body—fainting—with a <hi>moſt acute fever,</hi> ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with nervous and putrid febrile affections—the LO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAL; great thirſt—difficulty of breathing—<hi>pain in the region of the ſtomach—exceſſive heat, and a ſenſe of burning—continued painful vomiting—hiccough, and extreme pain from throwing up of wind, and particularly after taking any ſharp acrid medicines—fullneſs and tenſion of the ſtomach</hi>—the pulſe rather hard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and frequent—with coldneſs of the extremities.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, a prevalent prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the ſtomach being preſent—bruiſes on the region of that organ, or wounds in the ſtomach itſelf—drinking of cold water, fermented liquors, ſtrong acrid emetics or purgatives, or other acrid medicines thrown into the ſtomach—corroſive poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons—acrimonious humours generated in the blood, or repelled from the exterior parts of the machine, and thrown upon the coats of the ſtomach, ſuch as that of the ſmall-pox, miliary eruptions, gout, acrid bile, or any hard ſubſtances ſwallowed, and lodging in the ſtomach; or, in ſine, any thing fixed there capable of producing ſtrong irritation—which naturally bring on the <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate cauſe,</hi> inflammation.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Theſe may be known from the Italics in the deſcription.</p>
                  <p>CURE. This will in many caſes depend upon adverting to the cauſes acting upon the ſtomach, and taking off that action; but if it ariſes only from thoſe which commonly induce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, our chief dependence muſt be upon copious bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fomentations, cupping upon the parts, and local bliſtering, and keeping the body open with emollient glyſters—very little
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:028021_0333_0FD672AA998687D8"/>
can be expected from internal remedies, from the propenſity the ſtomach has to reject whatever is taken down—hence all we dare venture upon are demulcents, only moderately warm, ſuch as ſolutions of gum arabic, tragacanth, or ſpermaceti, with ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; to which may be added, a very ſmall portion of camphor, and three or four drops, now and then, of the tincture of opium—nitre may alſo be added to the glyſters, and thrown up freely into the bowels—flannels alſo, ſoaked in warm ſolution of nitre, may be applied as a fomentation.</p>
                  <p>But what we muſt moſt inſiſt upon muſt be bleeding—nor muſt we be directed by the pulſe, as in this caſe it is apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, for it is generally ſmall, quick, and irregular; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times intermittent; the operation ſhould therefore be repeated till the pulſe riſes, and beats with ſome degree of freedom.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, if reſolution is not accompliſhed in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, mortification will very rapidly ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe POISON <hi>ſhould be the cauſe,</hi> at a very early period a quickly acting emetic ſhould be given, ſuch as white or blue vitriol, inſtantaneouſly, and afterwards large draughts of new milk, or freſh butter melted, and oil; theſe are extremely ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; or any other ſheathing liquids, drank in ſuch quantity as to fill the whole alimentary canal, in order to guard the coats of the ſtomach and inteſtines from receiving any injury from the acrimony of the poiſonous ſtimulus—when even arſenic has been taken, theſe have been found efficacious.</p>
                  <p>Should the <hi>poiſons be compounded</hi> of any metalline ſubſtance joined with an acid, ſuppoſe corroſive ſublimate, before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation comes on, alkaline ſalt diſſolved in water ſhould be freely adminiſtered; this will diſunite the compound, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it inactive.</p>

                  <p>CURE. If it proceeds from common cauſes, ſuch as induce other local inflammations, the ſame mode muſt be purſued as has been repeatedly adviſed in the foregoing part of this work.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppurations are often formed here, which are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, notwithſtanding the abatement of the pain, by a ſenſe of weight perceptible about the region of the loins, with hot and cold fits ſucceeding each other, and the urine, from being high coloured, without ſediment, becoming whitiſh and turbid—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this circumſtance people will live many years, from there being ſo free an exit for the matter out of the machine by the ureters—however, in ulcerated kidneys, goat's whey, balſam of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>But thoſe calculous concretions, called ſtone, or gravel, are the moſt frequent ſource of inflammation in the kidneys—this cauſe is diſcoverable by the pain increaſing, and being more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute from exerciſe, or riding in a carriage—being more violent at intervals—from the urine being ſometimes gravelly, bloody, or mucous—the numbneſs of the the thigh—retraction of the teſticle on the ſide affected—pain following the courſe of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reters—as well as nauſea and vomiting being more violent.—The indication of cure in this caſe is, not only to take off the inflammation, but to procure a paſſage for the offending materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, whether gravel or calculus, by relaxing the parts, that it may ſlip away, and be evacuated.</p>

                  <p>DESCRIPTION.

                  <head>§ 1. HEAD-ACH.</head>
                  <p>IN this complaint, it will be ſufficient to enumerate the cauſes; becauſe it requires not any particular deſcription; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cauſe, to that is the cure adapted—but firſt we muſt obſerve, that it has been divided into three ſpecies, the two firſt agreeable to the nature of the affection; the laſt to its ſeat.</p>
                  <p>If there is a heavineſs and uneaſy dull ſenſation, occaſioning a pain in the head, as if it was too full, internally diſtended, and overloaded, it is denominated CEPHALALGIA, from <hi>kephalos,</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put, the head, and <hi>algos,</hi> dolor, pain;—and, by way of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, CEPHALAEA, if the whole head ſhould not only be affected, but the pain be acute and violent, having ſevere exacerbations, or increaſe of ſeverity on ſlight occaſions, with ſpaſmodic ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſoreneſs of the integuments.</p>
                  <p>And ſhould the pain attack either ſide of the head, chiefly at the temples, forehead near the eyes, and that ſhould be violent, and often periodical, it is called HEMICRANIA, from <hi>emiſus,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midium, half, and <hi>kranon,</hi> caput the head.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. 1ſt, A too great fullneſs of blood—2d, ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or retroceſſion of the menſes or piles—3d, morbid particles occaſioning intermittents—4th, from a load on the ſtomach, and indigeſtion—5th, different ſpecies of acrimony; as that of the pox, gout, rheumatiſm—6th, hyſteric ſpaſms—and, 7th, from latent cauſes undiſcoverable, or irremediable when known—to each of which in our mode of cure we muſt particularly advert.</p>
                  <p>If it deduces its origin from the FIRST—a full ſlow pulſe—florid countenance; though oftener pale—load and heavineſs of the head, particularly of the fore part, immediately after riſing in the morning, or ſtooping to the ground—a difficulty of thinking, of diſtinctly reaſoning, and defect of memory, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh this.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding and purgatives will generally afford relief; if not, cupping at the nape of the neck, or back part of the head, may be had recourſe to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="347" facs="unknown:028021_0343_0FD627E257397710"/>
If from the SECOND, bleeding during the fit will be neceſſary, and attempting to reproduce the periodic diſcharge, and ſolicit the renewal of the piles—bleeding in the feet in the former, and at the anus with leeches in the latter, may be attended with agreeable conſequences.</p>
                  <p>If from the THIRD, and it puts on intermittent appearances, bark alone, or coupled with valerian, (150. 193, 194.) (No. 32.) becomes efficacious, and giving emetics, (No. 11. 12, 38.) at proper intervals.</p>
                  <p>If from the FOURTH, it will be attended with throwing up of wind—nauſea—load and pain in the ſtomach—a bad taſte in the mouth—and vomiting; though this laſt will alſo attend both cephalalgia and hemicrania, (346.) without the origin of theſe diſeaſes being in the ſtomach, but in the head only; hence we ſhould be careful in making this proper diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if it is owing to the ſtomach, we muſt apply to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metics, (No. 11, 12, 38.) ſhould not any thing in the conſtitution prohibit their uſe; and afterwards to purgatives; taking care previouſly, if neceſſary, to empty the veſſels of the head by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; afterwards bitters and chalybeates, (No. 61 to 65.) to ſtrengthen the ſtomach—we muſt alſo aſſiduouſly prevent coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with proper aperients taken occaſionally. (No. 66, 108. 109.)</p>
                  <p>If from the FIFTH, we muſt proceed to attack the diſeaſes from whence they originate, as under theſe circumſtances they are only conſidered ſymptomatic.</p>
                  <p>If from the SIXTH, or thoſe called nervous headachs, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, volatile, antiſpaſmodic ſubſtances externally and locally applied, ſuch as WARD's eſſence, aether, compound ſpirit of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia, camphor, will ſometimes give immediate relief—plaiſters alſo made of opium, applied to the part affected, in periodical partial affections of the head, I have known efficacious.</p>
                  <p>If from the SEVENTH, we ſhall be convinced how impoſſible the cauſes are to be diſcovered, and how little is to be done, if we only mention what has appeared on diſſection of thoſe who have laboured under this complaint.</p>
                  <p>In ſome the <hi>ſutures of the ſcull</hi> were ſo cloſely and firmly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, that no traces of the junction of the bones of the cranium were to be found—in ſome <hi>the dura mater</hi> (26.) was thickened and indurated, and in others it held earthy concretions—the <hi>ſcull,</hi> in ſome, <hi>ſent out little proceſſes,</hi> like thorns, running through the membranes into the brain—and, in others, <hi>crude quickſilver</hi> was found in the ventricles of the brain, (27.) at the baſis of the ſcull.</p>
                  <p>Some periodic headachs, from ſuch latent cauſes, will continue
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:028021_0344_0FD672EA0BDAC270"/>

                  <p>Some general rules, however, are neceſſary to be obſerved, whatever may be the preciſe nature of the affection.</p>
                  <p>Patients ſubject to theſe complaints ſhould always keep their hands, arms, legs, and feet warm, particularly their legs, and have them well rubbed at bed-time—avoid coſtiveneſs—eat very light ſuppers—lie with their heads high, and in thin night-caps—their food ſhould be always light, and eaſy of digeſtion—their exerciſe moderate—and their minds kept in a ſtate of cheerful caſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> inſtance, ſmoke of tobacco poured into the ear, and afterwards warm oil, prove efficacious.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the ſymptoms are not violent—there are pain and ſwelling in the vicinity of the ear—running at the noſe—cough—but oftener a ſoreneſs of the throat—frequent ſounds and ringing of the ears—with painful ſenſations from thoſe which come externally.</p>
                  <p>This complaint is apt to be occaſioned by cold itſelf, or moiſt cold winds ſtriking the ears and head, expoſed to them without covering.</p>
                  <p>Local bleeding behind the ears with leeches, and bliſtering there, or the back part of the head, and, at the ſame time, the liniment, (No. 110.) may be dropt into the ear; ſedative foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, (No. 111.) are uſeful, with ſedatives and diaphoretics, (No. 4 to 10.) given internally.</p>

                  <p>This complaint is known by a throbbing, gnawing, darting, or ſome other ſpecies of pain in the teeth, attended with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſometimes with a ſwelling of the cheek, great diſcharges of ſaliva from the mouth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Its ſeat is ſuppoſed to be the nerve creeping over the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſometimes the external, membranous covering of the tooth.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. 1ſt, Caries, or decay of the tooth or teeth affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—2d, an acrid defluxion, or flux of acrimonious humours, as of the ſcurvy, rheumatiſm, gout, from the obſtructed perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—3d. nervous or hyſteric affections—and, 4th, pregnancy.</p>
                  <p>If it ariſes from the FIRST cauſe, it is generally perceptible to the ſight—the caries though ſometimes lurks between the teeth—ſometimes begins internally, ſometimes externally—however, when it is not perceptible to the eye, it may be diſcovered by the tooth being almoſt pellucid like pearl—or by the ſhock of ſome metallic inſtrument, which increaſes, or renews the pain—by a foetid breath—a ſharp darting pain from cold water, or cold air received into the mouth—from a gnawing pain—from the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the diſeaſe, without any conſiderable tumor of the gums—from ſiſtulous ulcerous gums, having a ſmall circular tumour round the orifice, and a purulent diſcharge—from rotten teeth, ulcerations have been formed, and ſwelling on the chin, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap> the cheeks, which are never cured without drawing the tooth.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Drawing is the firſt remedy—though, if at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a ſmall ſpeck or portion ſhould be perceived diſcoloured, that ſhould be immediately taken off, by which its progreſs would be ſtopped—applying oil of vitriol to the part affected, or muriatic acid, and neutralizing it with kali prepared, and then filling the hollow tooth with lead, or gum maſtich, has been ſucceſsful—a pill of opium and camphor, or of opium and calcined quickſilver—burning the part affected with a hot iron—cauterizing the ear—applying oil of cloves or cinnamon with lint to the rotten ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, have been recommended; if this diſeaſe returns from ſlight cauſes, and many of the teeth are in a ſtate of decay, experience approves of waſhing the mouth every morning with warm urine—though indelicate, this remedy has it advocates—perhaps, uſing in the ſame manner lavender-water, ſpirits of wine, or brandy, properly diluted, may be conſidered as good a preſervative.</p>

The gums in the beginning ſhould be ſcarified, or leeches applied; alſo muſtard plaiſters behind the ears, long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to occaſion a redneſs—or, in more obſtinate caſes, bliſters—the mouth ſhould be waſhed with warm milk and water—and internally, diaphoretics, coupled with ſedatives, (No. 4 to 10.) ſhould be given; ſmoaking tobacco, chewing pellitory of Spain, ginger, ſweet reed, pepper, &amp;c. to cauſe a flux of ſaliva; appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of warm reſinous plaiſters, (No. 112.) with opium to the temples ſhould be adminiſtered; flannels impregnated with the fumes of frankincenſe, amber, ſugar, &amp;c. applied warm to the cheek, and the mouth waſhed with ſpirits of wine and camphor.</p>
                  <p>If by theſe means the diſeaſe is not conquered, which general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens to be the caſe, but the pains perſiſt, and the gums in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to ſwell, an abſceſs will be moſt likely the conſequence; under theſe circumſtances a roaſted fig ſhould be kept upon the part to promote ſuppuration, which once accompliſhed, muſt at a proper time be opened, cleanſed, and healed, by the applications of pledgets, dipped in a mixture of honey of roſes and tincture of myrrh.</p>
                  <p>If from a defluxion of any ſpecific humour, we muſt proceed as in the ear-ach (348.) from ſimilar cauſes, making uſe of thoſe applications calculated to alleviate the local affections.</p>
                  <p>If from the THIRD, it generally yields to a courſe of antiſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic and ſedative medicines, ſuch as we find adviſed in hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric affections.</p>
                  <p>If from the FOURTH, there is no remedy, particularly in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits full of blood, ſo efficacious as bleeding.</p>

                  <head>§ 4. PAINS IN THE SIDE, OR PLEURODYNES,</head>
                  <p>from the Greek words <hi>pleuron,</hi> pleura, and <hi>odune,</hi> dolor, pain.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. This diſeaſe conſiſts of pungent pain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the cheſt on one ſide, attended with difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but without any acute fever, by which it is diſtinguiſhed from pleuriſy.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. 1ſt, Too great fullneſs—2d, worms—3d, ſpaſms—4th, adheſions—and 5th, flatulence; to the cure of which muſt our remedies be adapted.</p>
                  <p>If it ariſes from the FIRST, it may be diſcovered by the pain not being deeply ſeated, but affecting only the intercoſtal muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:028021_0347_0FD672B70B317E68"/>
(P. 33.) the difficulty of breathing unattended with oppreſſion; though accompanied with a cough, ſtill the pulſe is unaltered, nor is there any febrile heat; it generally originates from catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, or an obſtruction of the menſes.</p>
                  <p>CURE. This Nature often performs by a return of the menſes, and indeed it will in healthful habits precede their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                  <p>If from the FIRST, thin ſpare diet, gentle diaphoretics, (No. 1. 6 to 10.) and bleeding, are highly ſerviceable; volatile lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (No. 107.) muſtard plaiſters; warm flannels impregnated with aromatics, or warm water; bags of hot ſalt, or bladders, applied to the ſide, will expedite the cure—but ſhould they fail, local bleeding, by cupping, and bliſters to the part affected, we muſt call in aid.</p>
                  <p>If from the SECOND, there generally attends an erratic fever, but not of the inflammatory claſs—with a dry cough, pleuritic pain of the ſide; and worms are ſometimes evacuated—in the breath there is a particular offenſive ſmell—but theſe happen chiefly in infants.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Though one bleeding may be ſometimes neceſſary, if the fever runs high, to abate its violence, yet the chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is on cathartics, (P. 171, 172, 173.) emetics, (No. 11, 12, 38.) and vermifuges, (197.)—the purgatives though ſhould be of the milder claſs.</p>
                  <p>If from the THIRD, it generally proceeds from ſevere exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, or ſtrains; and is muſcular—for pains in the breaſt from ſuch cauſes are attended with ſuch ſenſibility of the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it cannot bear the touch, and feels as if the part had been bruiſed.—This though is ſeldom attended with a cough.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Bleeding—with emollient fomentations, (No. 111.) oily liniments, (No. 107.) and gentle purging, (No. 3. 19 to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>4.)</p>
                  <p>If from the FOURTH, as it proceeds from the lungs adhering to the pleura, occaſioned by preceding inflammation, it is often attended with a dry cough; ſometimes with bloody ſpits; fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile affections coming on after eating, without ſweating; but with difficulty and ſhortneſs of breathing; great uneaſineſs in lying on the ſide affected, and pleuritic blood.</p>
                  <p>CURE. The cauſe is irremediable, alleviation of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſymptoms is all for which we can hope,—and this muſt be attended by bleeding, diluent drinks, oily emulſions, or linct uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, (No. 81 to 84.) emollient decoctions, (142.) gentle ſedatives and diaphoretics, (No. 4 to 10.) nitrous medicines, (No. 2.) and a thin, ſpare diet—and all ſuch remedies as take off fulneſs from the veſſels, and render the circulating fluids thin.</p>
                  <p>If from the FIFTH, the pain in the ſide is ſudden, and acute,

                     </gap> for ſome minutes as to become intolerable, the pulſe is ſmall and ſlow; there is no cough; but the pain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſo troubleſome that it impedes the breathing. This moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ariſes from cold, and chiefly affects the melancholy, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal and thoſe who devote themſelves to ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Warm flannels, bladders filled with warm water, or bags of hot ſalt generally remove the complaint; and it will now and then be neceſſary to give ſome nervous tincture, (149, 150.)</p>
                  <p>But theſe pains, or ſtitches, have generally indigeſtion for their cauſe; therefore, to prevent their return, we muſt proceed in the ſame manner as we adviſe for aſſiſting the digeſtive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans in preſerving their functions, ſee Dyſpepſy, and increaſing their power; in order to prevent an accumulation of offenſive matter in the firſt paſſages; or crude chyle from being thrown into the maſs of circulating fluids.</p>
                  <p>If pains of the ſide ſhould ariſe from the action of any ſpecific acrimony—we muſt proceed as before directed, (556.)</p>

at others with a ſenſe of heat there, and in the gullet ariſing now and then to the fauces—then called <hi>heart-burn,</hi> and not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with a conſiderable diſcharge of ſaliva from the month—then ſtyled WATER BRASH, or BLACK WATER.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. 1ſt, Foulneſs from indigeſtion—2d, flatulence—3d, bile—4th, poiſons—5th, hard ſubſtances taken into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach—6th, inflexion of the lower part of the breaſt-bone, (called xyphoid, or enſiform cartilage, from its being point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a ſword)—7th, gout, worms—8th, debility, ulcers, or excoriations.</p>
                  <p>CURE. From conſidering the cauſes in the firſt five, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications are very nearly ſimilar, except in the flatulent, to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the contents, and ſo to invigorate the ſtomach and inteſtines, that digeſtion not only may be properly promoted, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, or what is indigeſtible, may be carried out of the machine regularly by the increaſed power of the inteſtines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If, therefore, it ariſes from foulneſs of the ſtomach occaſioned by indigeſtion,</hi> which paſſes not off ſoon by vomiting; or purging, but continues, the orifices of the ſtomach will be contracted, and preſſing upon its contents, occaſion ſevere pain, with a ſenſe of weight, reſtraining free reſpiration; ſometimes the pulſe will be hard and quick; at others depreſſed, and ſlow—this will be the caſe where the complaint is recent, and proceeds merely from indigeſtion, and matter which the ſtomach contains being in a crude ſtate only; but if it is <hi>viſcid, acrid, bilious, putrid,</hi> or <hi>ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,</hi> there will be a diſagreeable taſte on the palate—foul tongue—unpleaſant eructations, added to the uneaſineſs at the ſtomach, nauſea, and load in the region above the navel, with a loſs of appetite; beſides, if the matter is acrid, there will be a heat in the ſtomach, the nature of which will be denoted by a taſte in the mouth if any thing is thrown up, whether <hi>acid, ſalt, bitter, rancid,</hi> or <hi>oily;</hi>—in caſes where the matter is <hi>merely viſcid,</hi> there is a kind of watery inſipid taſte in the mouth only.</p>
                  <p>Which ever of theſe cauſes are prevalent, if the habit is coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I clear the firſt paſſages with ſome opening medicine, (No. 108, 109.)</p>
                  <p>Afterwards waſh the ſtomach well with warm water and oil—chamomile flower tea drank plentifully—or ſtimulate the top of the gullet with a feather, or preſcribe an emetic, (No. 11, 12. 38.)—if great expedition is requiſite, a few grains of white or blue vitriol, (No. 259.) ſhould the cauſe be mere load from indigeſtion; theſe will be ſufficient, giving for a little time a few drops of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir of vitriol in cinnamon tea twice a day; but ſhould this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance often occur, from the debility of the coats of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, I have recourſe to bitter ſtimulants and chalybeates, (No.
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:028021_0350_0FD67325A2F13890"/>
61 to 65.) and recommend riding exerciſe, or ſailing—alſo the uſe of ſome chalybeate water, particularly thoſe of Bath, which contribute much to invigorate the tone of the ſtomach—but ſhould the offending cauſe conſiſt in the quality of the offending matter, ſuch things muſt be preſcribed as counteract their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
                  <p>If it is of an <hi>acid nature,</hi> magneſia, abſorbent earths, alkalines, or thoſe medicines termed antacids, may be applied to (191)—if <hi>acrid,</hi> the ſtomach ſhould be well waſhed with weak chicken broth, or warm water alone; then gentle aperients ſhould be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, (No. 3. 22 to 24.) and occaſionally perſiſted in.</p>
                  <p>If merely <hi>viſcid,</hi> ſaponaceous medicines, (No. 109.) are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>If rancid, or putrid, the antalkalines; particularly the mineral acids, (190.)</p>
                  <p>And in all theſe caſes the ſtomach ſhould be invigorated with ſtimulant bitters, &amp;c. adviſed (353.) and ſuch mode of living preſcribed as will prevent the generation of theſe offenſive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials; avoiding ſuch viands as are apt to turn acid, alkaline, viſcid, or rancid; and perhaps the only thing we can depend upon for completing the cure, is a courſe of ſuch mineral wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as upon trial beſt ſuit the conſtitution, which can only from experiment be aſcertained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the complaints ariſe from flatulence,</hi> it is cauſed by wind diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the ſtomach, and throwing its orifices into a contracted ſtate, hence there is a violent tenſive pain at the pit of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, with difficulty of breathing;—the pulſe grows ſmall and depreſſed—the extremities are cold, with great anxiety—and the body is often ſolicited to bend forwards, to promote the emiſſion of wind; which always brings ſome alleviation—in this caſe <hi>the region above the navel can bear preſſure with the hand,</hi> which it cannot do in inflammation of the ſtomach, nor pain from ſome other cauſes.</p>
                  <p>CURE. In full ſanguinary habits bleeding is adviſeable;—and to remove coſtiveneſs glyſters, (No. 25. 26.) which is very often an attendant; notwithſtanding which, ſhould it continue, opiates (No. 113.) are requiſite; though, in ſlight caſes, pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mint water will be ſufficient—till the pain has totally ceaſed for a day or two, cathartics, even the milder ones, ſhould be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In order to prevent its return, the patient ſhould abſtain from all food difficult of digeſtion; all crude, flatulent, or legu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous vegetables;—the body ſhould be kept open, and a courſe of bitters and chalybeates be perſiſted in for ſome time.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>from acrid bile</hi> the pain is extremely acute, accompanied with vomiting of green materials like a leak, or verdigreaſe—ſometimes 
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:028021_0351_0FD672EF75BA2298"/>
yellow, with ſuch tenderneſs above the navel, that the part cannot bear the leaſt preſſure—there is extreme debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with great dejection of ſpirits; indeed the pain is ſometimes ſo acute as to bring on convulſions.</p>
                  <p>We muſt proceed as recommended (353.) where acrid mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials were the cauſe; afterwards, when the ſtomach is perfectly cleanſed, opiates muſt be taken internally, (152.) or by way of glyſter; and perhaps it may firſt be neceſſary to premiſe bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if the pain is extremely acute, to prevent inflammation.—The bilious colic ſeems to have the ſame origin, the ſeat of the affection only differing—to that, therefore, we muſt refer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In caſe of poiſon being the cauſe,</hi> we muſt proceed in the ſame manner as in inflammation of the ſtomach from the ſame ſourc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es—in gout or worms—ſuch remedies are ſerviceable as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed in thoſe particular diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>If from <hi>debility,</hi> we muſt proceed as directed (353:)</p>
                  <p>If from <hi>extraneous bodies,</hi> which are ſmall, and blunt, we muſt have recourſe to emetics—if long and pointed, the ſtomach ſhould be kept diſtended with materials of the demulcent claſs, ſo that an opportunity may be given for them to paſs through the lower orifice of the ſtomach, and along the courſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines; for if emetics are had recourſe to, there is great danger of their getting acroſs the upper orifice, or ſticking in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and moſt probably terminating fatally.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>from the inflexion of the lower part of the breaſt-bone,</hi> there is a conſtant pain of the ſtomach, attended with vomiting, loſs of appetite; and from a continuance of the diſeaſe, a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, called ATROPHY—the food and liquids are immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as ſoon as taken, and the pain continues to torment the unhappy patient for years.</p>
                  <p>Cupping-glaſſes applied to the region above the navel, and afterwards an aſtringent plaiſter, have been adviſed.</p>
                  <p>A reduction of it, by the manual operation of a ſkilful ſurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, has been aſſerted by BONETUS—as for my own part, pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive remedies I think the only things to be depended upon—the utility of which I have experienced. Keeping the ſtomach as empty as poſſible, eating ſmall portions of the moſt eaſily digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible food, often in the day—refraining from all which are flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent—taking very moderate exerciſe—avoiding coſtiveneſs, and, in fine, ſo conducting the patient, that the ſtomach ſhall be but ſlightly diſtended, is all that can be done in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>from excoriations, or ulcerations of the ſtomach, or its lower orifice,</hi> it is the moſt obſtinate and dreadful, for this may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for many years—this is known by extreme increaſe of heat and pain on taking any thing acrid or hot—vomits here may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:028021_0352_0FD6732722A621E8"/>
detrimental, and dangerous in the extreme—in this caſe nothing can be done but giving all thoſe things which are ſoft, mild, and ſheathing; and what bids faireſt for relief is living ſolely upon a milk diet.</p>
                  <p>Beſides what we have here enumerated, the heart-burn will be attended ſometimes with an efflux of clear lymph like ſaliva, ſometimes taſteleſs, ſometimes acrid like the taſte of lime, and comes up at intervals in conſiderable quantity. This ariſes from a ſpaſmodic contraction of the ſtomach, and increaſed action of veſſels which ſecrete the thin fluids of the ſtomach and ſalivary glands, (20)</p>
                  <p>In this caſe, the rough acerb fruits and warming vegetables may be uſeful, as horſe-radiſh, muſtard, quince, ſloes, medlars, &amp;c.—watery fruits and vegetables ſhould be particularly avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as cherries, cucumbers, melons, and ſuch like; and aſtring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſlightly cordial, (No. 61 to 65.) exhibited.</p>

This is a painful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the inteſtines, originating from a conſtriction, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in ſome part, or parts of them, brought on by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtimulus, attended with an acute burning pain of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, particularly running round the navel, difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heart-burn, nauſea, or vomiting of a bilious or viſcid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, coſtiveneſs, the appetite and digeſtion weakened—a diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and inflation of the lower belly—thirſt—high-coloured, or yellow urine, often an obſtruction in making water—hiccough—fainting—delirium—convulſions, a rupture of the inteſtines, or mortification.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, ſpaſmodic affections, or biliary concretions, ſtopping the ductus communis choledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, (36.)—acrid bile—different kinds of ſoul offenſive materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in the bowels—hardened faeces—worms—ruptures—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of ſolid food—earthy or ſtony concretions lodged in the inteſtines—compreſſion of them formed in any of the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous viſcera—introſuſception, or the running of one inteſtine into another, and there confined by ſome ſtricture—a thickening of the coats by ſcirrhus, cancer, &amp;c.—particles of lead—unripe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid wines—or drinking too freely of things acerbly acid—or, in fine, whatever is poſſeſſed of the power of inducing the</p>
                  <p>CAUSE, <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate;</hi> which is a conſtriction or obſtruction in ſome part or parts of the alimentary canal, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

the upper or lower orifice of the ſtomach, the lower por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the duodenum, (42.) at the valve of the colon, (4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Pain of the abdomen, or lower belly, running round the navel, attended with vomiting and coſtiveneſs:</p>
                  <p>CURE. The indications are, a removal of the conſtricting or obſtructing cauſe, by taking off the ſpaſms, and evacuating the irritating matter, from whence they deduce their origin.</p>
                  <p>We have before treated of the inflammation of the bowels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which, and the colic attended with local inflammatory ſymptoms, ſome make a diſtinction; this may be ſyſtematically right, but cannot be of any practical utility; for the mode of cure muſt obviouſly be the ſame—though we muſt obſerve, that the colic with any acute fever, or quick pulſe, heat of the whole body, ſweat, &amp;c. appears only to be a ſlight inflammation of the inteſtines from ſome local cauſe, not producing general inflammatory ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>But the colic pain will ſometimes be attended with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of flatulence, from the air in the bowels being rarefied, and expanding itſelf—hence pain, diſtenſion, coſtiveneſs, and rolling of wind in the lower belly—if the conſtriction of the bowels continue long, their motion downwards, called periſtaltic, will be inverted, and vomiting the conſequence.</p>
                  <p>That it is from wind which occaſions the ſtrongeſt ſymptom, is very obvious, by the alleviation from pain by the diſcharge of it downwards; from the pain purſuing the whole tract of the colon, (43.) or running round the lower belly, appearing alſo to affect the ſtomach; but that affection ſubſiding by the paſſing down of wind, or its change of ſituation; on preſſure by being mitigated rather than increaſed; and by not being attended by any remarkable thirſt, or alteration of the pulſe.</p>
                  <p>At other times, it will have for its aſſociate bilious vomiting, which is difficult to reſtrain; the patient will alſo have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a number of bilious ſtools—<hi>when vomiting of green-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matter</hi> is the leading ſymptom, theſe attend heart-burn, loathing of food, hoarſeneſs, hiccough, heat, thirſt, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the mouth—the urine is high-coloured, and made in ſmall quantity.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>bilious ſtools,</hi> the pain attendant generally affects the whole inteſtines, particularly the duodenum, (42.)—the lower belly is neither tenſe nor hot, as in inflammation of the bowels—the patient is affected with giddineſs—the pulſe is quick,
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:028021_0354_0FD673295B1764F0"/>
though neither hard nor tenſe—and this diſeaſe is often ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the jaundice.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe complaints, where the pain is very acute, bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be had recourſe to, though no inflammation ſhould actually exiſt, in full habits particularly, very early to prevent that ſymptom ſupervening.—Emollient oily glyſters, (No. 25, 26.) warm fomentations, friction, and chamomile tea, in ſlight and common caſes, will ſubdue the complaint—but when more obſtinate, chicken water ſhould be drank plentifully; then glyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thrown up occaſionally, and repeated—if the firſt does not anſwer, a ſecond ſtronger, (No. 114.)—ſhould theſe be ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, oily purgatives may be tried alone, (No. 66, 99.) or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Rochelle ſalt, and continued till a free evacuation is produced—caſtor oil is the moſt efficacious, as it often alleviates pain before it procures any evacuation, which it alſo does very quickly.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes liquids will be rejected, purgatives then in a ſolid form muſt be tried, (No. 115.) and continued every hour till the wiſhed-for effect occurs—but ſhould the attendant pain be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſevere, with cathartics we may couple opiates; or ſeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive medicines may be given firſt, and a ſmall time afterwards, purgatives—by theſe means ſometimes the gentler purgatives will anſwer every purpoſe—bags filled with ſalt, oats, boiled bran, or water made hot, may be applied to the belly.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould there be any ſuſpicion of inflammation, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtimulant cathartics muſt be avoided—the Epſom ſalt ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (No. 97.) is preferable to other purgatives; for, diffused in that way, it is always pleaſant, and gentle in its operation.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould always inquire in theſe caſes, whether there be any rupture; for, from the ſtrangulation of the inteſtines puſhed out into the ſac externally, this complaint ſometimes ariſes.</p>
                  <p>In order to ſtop the vomiting, the ſaline draught in a ſtate of fermentation (No. 59.) ſhould be tried—ſedative glyſters, (No. 116.) and plaiſters of mithridate, may be applied to the ſtomach—leaves of common garden mint, boiled in port, and laid on the pit of the ſtomach and wriſts, have been found ſometimes ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to every other application.</p>
                  <p>Should there be any appearance of bile copiouſly diſcharged, ſoftening glyſters, ſuch as decoction of linſeed and marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, with oil, ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>

If this complaint, from a bilious cauſe, ſhould return, which it is apt to do, a courſe of ſaponaceous and deobſtruent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, (No. 117.) with Seltzer waters, or the water of Bath, or Aix la Chapelle, ſhould be had recourſe to, in hopes of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a radical cure.</p>
                  <p>So difficult is it ſometimes to procure a paſſage through the inteſtines, that when the gentler cathartics fail, the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ought to be tried, (No. 108. 115.) to which may be added from half a grain to a grain of opium; or opia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>DESCRIPTION. This complaint is attended with very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere pains in the back and loins, as if it was in the center of the meſentery, (46.) which do not increaſe on preſſure—the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel is very often drawn inwards, and the inteſtines ſometimes alſo to the ſpine; ſo much ſo, indeed, that the forcing up of gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters has been impracticable—the body is coſtive, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint extremely obſtinate; ſometimes terminating in torpor, or

                     </gap> in chronical fixed contractions of the limbs.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, particles of lead re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the habit—or the ſmoke from lead—or drinking wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which runs over its ore—unripe acid wine—cyder—punch—and white wine not ſufficiently fermented—eating or drinking too freely, or too frequently of things acerbly acid. The <hi>proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> ſimilar to that of the colic, (356.) and the <hi>characteriſtic ſigns</hi> alſo, if we add, the pain creeping more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the loins and back, with a retraction of the navel, and ſometimes of the inteſtines, inwards.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Before the complaint is confirmed, in the beginning, ſucceſs may be expected from the application of ſuch glyſters as were before preſcribed, (No. 25. 26.) adding to them caſtor oil, and keeping the body open with emulſions of the ſame oil, (No. 66.) with which two or three ounces of tincture of ſenna may be mixed.</p>
                  <p>Cold muſt be avoided, and a very light eaſily digeſtible diet ſtrictly adhered to.</p>
                  <p>But in the more advanced ſtage, where there is generally a vomiting of green bile, <hi>the diſcharge is to be encouraged</hi> by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely of thin weak broth—<hi>the hardened excrements evacuated by repeated glyſters—an alleviation of pain procured</hi> by more than common doſes of opium, (152.) and theſe repeated—the belly muſt be fomented with warm fomentations, (No. 85. 111.)—warm bathing partially uſed—and the umbilical region bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes found great benefit by opiated emulſions, (No. 118.) given till ſtools were procured freely; afterwards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated antimonials, (No 119.) occaſionally giving the emulſion.</p>
                  <p>In Charleſtown they adopt the following ſcheme:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they bleed, then give the glyſter, (No. 114.) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it two or three times, till a ſtool or more are procured—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> this does not alleviate the pain, then an opiated glyſter, (No. 116.) and the following morning exhibit the vitriolic mixture, (No. 120.)—the effects produced are generally a diſcharge of a great quantity of acrid bile, for the firſt four or five days, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and downwards, which by degrees grows leſs, leaving gradually only a ſlight nauſea, a few yellow ſtools daily, and ſometimes not any.</p>
                  <p>Broth, gruel, and panada, are allowed as diet—if ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="361" facs="unknown:028021_0357_0FD672F3F2A05F78"/>
ſome months; and the patients return to their common mode of living by ſlow degrees.</p>
                  <p>If a pain in the ſtomach continues, which is ſometimes the caſe, rhubarb is adviſed, and a plaiſter of galbanum applied to the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p>Though death, by theſe means ſhould be avoided, not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This complaint has been relieved, ſometimes cured, by rubbing the limbs and down the back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſpine, with Barbadoes tar and rum, or rock oil. (150.)—the Barbadoes tar, or balſam of Peru, taken internally, has been thought ſerviceable. (No. 121.)</p>
                  <p>But ſhould theſe not ſucceed, change of climate, ſea voyage, or the natural hot baths, are the only remedies from whence ſucceſs is to be expected.</p>

                  <p>When it ariſes from GALL STONES, there is a deep-ſeated and excruciating pain on the right ſide of the ſtomach, extending to the back, about the place where the ductus communis choledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, or duct of the gall-bladder, (30.) is inſerted into the duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum, (42.) which remits and increaſes; the patient complains of ſickneſs, and vomits much—the right ſide is diſtended with flatulence—the belly coſtive—the excrements pale-coloured, ſometimes white—the pulſe is weaker, but ſcarce at all quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, unleſs the pains are very violent, and continue long—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>the violence of the pain being unattended with fever, and quickneſs of the pulſe,</hi> is conſidered as the certain ſymptom of this diſeaſe—the patient, either in an erect poſture, or lying on the left ſide, feels much uneaſineſs—hence becomes reſtleſs—there attend alſo difficulty of breathing—heart-burn, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times convulſions—at firſt the urine is pale, afterwards yellow—and the ſkin and white of the eyes have a jaundice-like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance—the pain at laſt vaniſhes ſuddenly, which is ſometimes ſucceeded by a looſeneſs, by which the gall ſtones are thrown out of the habit—and the yellowneſs wears gradually away.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Pain in the liver from ſchirrhoſity, (361.) is apt to attack gluttons—hard drinkers—thoſe who lead indolent ſluggiſh lives—and alſo ariſes from ſuppreſſion of ſome haemorrhages—bruiſes upon the right ſide—and very often in thoſe afflicted with long-continued intermittent fevers—and generally proves fatal, when once completely formed—though, it attacked in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, it may be ſometimes prevented.</p>

In <hi>the cold and phlegmatic</hi> (60.) the mode here recommended will be proper when the complaint ariſes from obſtructions of the biliary pores; but, in delicate and irritable habits, ſpaſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic affections will ſometimes be the cauſe, ſedatives and antiſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modics may then be joined with the aperients, aſafoetida, cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, (149, 150.) or with opium, (152.)—and when, by theſe means, the bile has paſſed into the bowels, a courſe of bitters and ſteel may be neceſſary to complete the cure, (No. 61 to 64.)—taking care always to keep the body open with ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as are beſt adapted to move the bile. (No. 108. 117.)</p>
                  <p>Bath water, and chalybeate ſprings in general, are beneficial and proper to prevent a relapſe.</p>
                  <p>When it ariſes from GALL STONES, we muſt endeavour to promote the expulſion by long perſeverance in the uſe of emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients, (142.) and gentle cathartics, (170, 171, 172.) (No. 66. 98, 99.)—warm baths afterwards, occaſionally repeated, in which a cathartic may be given—this mode has proved ſucceſsful—vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and ſtrong expiration, with glyſters of freſh urine, and ſage infuſion, have fortunately ſucceeded—opiates ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to alleviate the pain, joined with aperients; becauſe they promote at the ſame time a relaxation of the duct—aetheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſpirit of turpentine, (No. 122.) has been recommended as a ſolvent.</p>
                  <p>In habits full of blood, in any of theſe complaints, bleeding may be had recourſe to, leſt inflammation ſhould be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the violence or long continuance of the pain.</p>
                  <p>Old people and women are moſt ſubject to this complaint—thoſe who lead ſedentary lives, drink much of ſtrong ardent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, feed on viſcid, coarſe, and dry aliment, or are ſubject to the ſtone and gout.</p>
                  <p>In order to prevent a return of theſe complaints, gentle exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, particularly riding on horſeback, ſhould be perſevered in; light eaſily digeſtible food taken, avoiding all that is viſcid.</p>

                  <p>Here, as in the liver, the diſeaſe ariſes from ſchirrhoſity and obſtruction.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. When from the FIRST, it is diſcoverable by a hard tumor occupying the ſeat of the ſpleen, (38) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling its figure, attended with a ſenſe of weight—the tumor is ſometimes wonderfully large—ſucceeds a quartan intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and often runs into a dropſy of the belly—the complexion of thoſe labouring under this complaint is of a lead colour—they

                  <p>from <hi>nephron,</hi> ren, kidneys, and <hi>algos,</hi> dolor, pain.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe proceeds either from ſmall ſand-like appearances, or from a ſtony ſubſtance affecting the kidneys or ureters, (48, 50.)—in the firſt caſe it is called GRAVEL, in the laſt STONE IN THE KIDNEYS; both which we ſhall treat under one head, as the mode of treatment of the former is ſimilar to the more gentle method uſed in the latter.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. The gravel is moſt common to old men, the ſtudious and ſedentary, and thoſe whoſe trades oblige them to fit long confined in one poſture, as coblers, weavers, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, &amp;c.—ſeldom affects the kidneys, but much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the ureters and urethra, (54.) occaſioning oftentimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great pain which abating, ſmall ſtones like lentil-ſeed, but rough, red, and very hard, are paſſed at that time with the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine—theſe ſeldom ſtick in their paſſage, and are ſcarcely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable by any known lithontriptic. (198.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="365" facs="unknown:028021_0361_0FD672FA002B6D30"/>
When there is a ſtone in the kidney, there is generally an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating pain in the loins, fixed and permanent, on that ſide where the ſtone lodges—the patients complain of heat—the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is coſtive—and the ſymptoms are aggravated after eating—when it falls into the ureters, the pain is increaſed, and extends along their courſe obliquely in the belly over the hip towards the bladder—men have at this time a painful affection, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of teſticle, women a numbneſs of the thigh and leg—nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea and vomiting frequently occur—the urine is in part ſuppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and puts on various appearances; at firſt it is watery, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more copious and turpid; frequently hot, and often bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or purulent—a difficulty of making water, or rather a total ſuppreſſion, comes on—great drowſineſs—inflammation—ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—and conſumption.</p>
                  <p>But it muſt be obſerved, that a ſtone may be lodged in the kidney without producing any uneaſy ſenſation, unleſs moved by a hot regimen, or mode of living, violent paſſions, ſtrong exerciſe, or jolting in a carriage over rough ſtony pavements.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, luxurious living, with weak digeſtive powers—gout and rheumatiſm—old age—ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life—keeping much in bed, or in an horizontal poſition—drinking wine loaded with tartar, or water full of earthy or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy matter—peculiarity in the conſtitution to form this ſtony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance—or an hereditary taint. The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> need no ſpecification</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A fixed pain in the region of the kidneys and ureters, unattended with any acute fever, ſuch as accompanies the inflammation of theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>CURE. The indications are, to abate the uneaſy ſymptoms, by taking off the ſpaſmodic affection of, ſheathing and relaxing the parts, and facilitating the progreſs of the offending cauſe, that it may be evacuated—which purpoſes will be promoted by bleeding, emollient and demulcent decoctions drank plentifully, ſedatives, chiefly opiates, oily emulſions, and mild aperients, &amp;c.

eight or ten ounces, with twenty drops of aethereal ſpirit of ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, twice a day for two months, great relief has been deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Still, ſoap leys, (199. taken in milk or veal broth, or ſoap and lime water, (199.) are conſidered either as perfect ſolvents, or rendering the rugged ſurfaces and ſharp points leſs capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring the ſenſible membranes, where theſe hard bodies paſs through or lodge.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes a ſmall ſtone will paſs through the ureters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bladder, and from thence makes its exit: here then the diſeaſe terminates in the moſt favourable manner; but if it ſhould be too large, it remains there, forming a baſis, called Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleus, for a larger ſtone—indeed, any hard ſubſtance lying in the bladder will give riſe to this complaint in conſtitutions replete with ſtony matter—in this caſe it is termed,</p>

                  <p>from <hi>lithon,</hi> lapis, ſtone.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. In this diſeaſe, there is generally a pain in the bladder, eſpecially about its neck, and oftentimes bloody u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine after riding on horſeback, on being jolted much in a carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, a ſenſe of weight in the perineum, or part immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the anus, with an itching of the glans penis, (55.) a ſlimy ſediment in the urine, and frequent ſtoppages in making wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſtone ſhould be ſmooth, of a round form, it may lie a conſiderable time before it is perceptible to the patient, till by its increaſe of weight, acquired by acceſſion of freſh matter, it creates uneaſy ſenſations—but ſhould it be angular, or have a rugged ſurface, yet ſmall in ſize, it generally occaſions pain and bloody urine, or a diſcharge of ſlimy fluid, with a fruitleſs effort to go to ſtool, called <hi>teneſmus,</hi> and difficulty of making water.</p>
                  <p>All theſe ſymptoms though are fallacious—examining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the inſtrument called a STAFF, uſed by ſurgeons for diſcovering the ſtone in the bladder, is chiefly to be depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and I believe, when one is found too large to paſs, cutting is the only remedy, which muſt be committed to the hands of a ſkilful and judicious operator.</p>

                     <p>The FIRST may ariſe from inflammation of the kidneys, or a ſtone, and becomes a ſymptom, and then muſt be cured as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed in caſes of nephritis, (342.) and nephralgia, (364.) but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it derives its origin from mucus thrown into the veſſels of the kidneys, (48.) in ſuch a degree as to hinder almoſt the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſecretion of urine.</p>
                     <p>DESCRIPTION. In this caſe there is generally a ſmall quantity of turbid urine made, without any pain of the region below the navel, or ſwelling over the bone at the lower part of the belly, called os pubis, or any ſigns of the ſtone or gravel but a dull, heavy pain over the loins; and this happens in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions which are generally phlegmatic, (60.) mucous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes having preceded, and urine before made loaded with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</p>
                     <p>CURE. Stimulating diuretics, (175, 176.) ſuch as muſtard, horſe-radiſh, with ſquills; alſo ſoap, (177.) in order to clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the mucus, free the urinary veſſels, leave at liberty and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit the ſecretory veſſels of the kidneys to perform their office; for in theſe caſes we find little or no urine comes into the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We muſt obſerve, that when the <hi>ſuppreſſion</hi> is total, there can be little or no hope of giving relief; it is only in caſes where it is partial, that our expectations with ſucceſs can be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                     <p>When the urine is retained in the bladder, we obſerve a ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the loweſt part of the belly above the bone ſituated at the bottom, attended with pain, and often a ſenſe of fulneſs, and preſſure at the neck of the bladder.</p>

                     <p>DESCRIPTION. Beſides the effort to unload the bladder by paſſing urine by drops, and with great pain, and ſometimes ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſtimulus, after a ſmall quantity of water has been made, goes off, and ſoon returns; the feveriſh affections are increaſed, the ſkin grows hot, the belly ſwells, at the lower part, particularly the penis, and the part running to the anus, appear full; the body is in general coſtive; and there are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent efforts to go to ſtool; there is alſo a perceptible pain in the back and lower part of the belly, an uneaſineſs at the pit of the ſtomach, and vomiting ſometimes attend.</p>
                     <p>CAUSES. Thoſe which are conſidered the <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> are ſaid to be—an acrimonious diſpoſition of the humours; cantharides internally taken; the application of bliſters; and matter carried from the kidneys, or tranſlated from any other of the ulcerated viſcera; ſtrongly ſtimulating injections, or venereal ulcers of the urethra, (54.) inducing inflammation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the anus to the cold air, particularly during the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſmart cathartics; an inflammation of the rectum, (45.) or ſuppreſſion of the piles.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>proximate,</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> an inflammation of the ſphincter (51.) of the bladder, or a deprivation of the mucus which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it from feeling the irritating power of the urine, as it paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es through it.</p>
                     <p>This diſeaſe is by no means dangerous, and terminates in the ſame manner as do other local inflammations, <hi>though extremely rarely in mortification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>CURE. This requires no mode of treatment different from other local inflammations, particularly that of the bladder, (340.)
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:028021_0365_0FD6730012468338"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. When it affects the habit generally, it begins with a coldneſs and ſhivering, which are ſucceeded by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at, reſtleſſneſs, coldneſs, and heavineſs of the limbs; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is commonly coſtive, the patient complains of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hirſt, and the pulſe is quick and hard.</p>
                  <p>To theſe ſucceed in a little time acute pain, attacking parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the large joints, tendons, and their expanſions running along the courſe of the muſcles; which pain is increaſed on mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, often changing its ſituation, and where it fixes there comes on ſwelling and inflammation; it ſometimes attacks the head and ſtomach, and very often all the febrile ſymptoms will go off, and leave the pain remaining. The blood taken away has the appearance of that of pleuritic patients; this is called the acute RHEUMATISM; but when it is not attended with febrile affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the pain flies from one part to another, giving a ſenſe of ſtiffneſs to the muſcular or ligamentous parts, and is ſeldom at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with any ſwelling.</p>
                  <p>When the pain recedes internally, there ariſes much uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inward ſtiffneſs, which on re-appearing go off.</p>
                  <p>WHEN IT ATTACKS THE HIP, it impedes the free motion of the leg, occaſioning pain and an halting in walking, or drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the leg; the pain often deſcends from the hip along the thigh and leg to the feet; and it is ſometimes attended with a
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:028021_0366_0FD6733783058F40"/>
violent fever; in this caſe the ſeat of the affection is ſometimes in the joint of the hip, and at others in the nerve called ſcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</p>
                  <p>WHEN IT SEIZES THE LOINS—In them there is a very acute pain, with great difficulty in raiſing the body into an erect poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſometimes the pain deſcends to the lower part of the back, to the thigh-joint, or through the ſides towards the bladder—here the muſcles of the loins, or the ligaments of the vertebrae, are the ſeat.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. <hi>The remote,</hi> or <hi>inducing,</hi> are, an expoſure to cold ſuddenly whilſt hot, too great loſs of blood, or ſevere purging, hard drinking, immoderate venery, indigeſtion, a vitiated ſtate of the fluids from other diſeaſes, a too great fullneſs from evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations ſuppreſſed, and often from quick changes of the weather. The lumbago will alſo be brought on by lifting too heavy weights, in habits diſpoſed to rheumatic affections.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proximate,</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> have been ſuppoſed to be a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid acrimonious ſerum obſtructing the ſerous and lymphatic veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the muſcles, but particularly of the membranes, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments; or rather a peculiar acrimony, electively affecting the larger joints, membranes, and tendons of the muſcles.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. This diſeaſe ariſes from an external, and, for the moſt part, from an evident cauſe, attended with pain about the joints, following the courſe of the muſcles, affecting the knees and the larger joints rather than thoſe of the hands and feet; ſometimes the hip muſcles, and vertebrae of the loins: frequently having febrile affections for its aſſociate, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not.</p>
                  <p>CURE. When it is attended with febrile ſymptoms, we muſt have recourſe to bleeding, and that repeated according to the ſtrength of the patient, and violence of the inflammatory affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and two drams of nitre diſſolved in a quart of water gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el ſweetened with honey, and acidulated with lemon juice, forms not an inefficacious remedy, giving a tea-cupful every ſecond hour, throwing up occaſionally glyſters, or giving occaſionally cooling purges, to keep the body open, (P. 171, 172. or No. 3. 22, 23, 24.)—to the nitre may be added one-eighth of a grain of tartariſed antimony in each doſe, or to the purgatives.</p>
                  <p>Or the antimonial nitrated powder, (No. 125.) with the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſaline mixture, may be given every five or ſix hours, (No. 126) adding two or three grains of the powder to the night doſe.</p>
                  <p>Should theſe not keep the body open, glyſters may be given, or aperients added to the powder or mixture.</p>
                  <p>Theſe generally abate the febrile ſymptoms, mitigate the pain,
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:028021_0367_0FD6730019C002B0"/>
and evacuate the acrimony, by keeping up a continued, gentle perſpiration.</p>
                  <p>When the diſeaſe is on the decline, the rapidity of the fever and the violence of the pain are abated, <hi>not before</hi>—ſteams of warm water may be conveyed to the parts affected, or friction if the parts can bear it, or liniment of water of acetated ammonia, and oil may be rubbed warm into, and a flannel worn over the part.</p>
                  <p>After ſufficient bleeding, and emptying the inteſtines, partial or general warm baths have been found to give great relief; and our patients ſhould uſe the ſame ſort of diet as recommended in inflammatory fever, (212. to 214.) but when all the febrile ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms begin to abate, muſtard whey, (No. 127.) will be an uſeful drink.</p>
                  <p>Now from experience we find, though the criſis of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint happens either <hi>by ſweat,</hi> or <hi>urine</hi> dropping a yellow ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>looſeneſs,</hi> or depoſiting an humor upon the exterior ſurface, particularly the legs—ſtill it is beſt conveyed out of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine by the pores of the ſkin—hence a courſe of diaphoretics are adviſed, and the patient ordered to lie in blankets in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to linen, in order to add to their efficacy.</p>
                  <p>When the pain goes off, and the fever ſubſides, the diet ſhould be more ſubſtantial; and with intent to clear the conſtitution as perfectly as poſſible from the remains of the offending cauſe, a decoction ſhould be taken of diaphoretic woods, (No. 88.) or the compound decoction of ſarſaparilla—ſhould ulcers happen upon the legs; they ſhould not be dried up too ſoon, for fear of imprudently repelling the humour to ſome internal part, which might prove more dangerous.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes, after the febrile affections are totally gone off, the pain ſtill continues, and here we muſt labour to attenuate and throw out the acrimony which creates the painful affections, by a courſe of gentle diaphoretics—ſuch as compound powder of ipecacuanha—or antimonials (230.) joined with opiates, in order that reſt may be procured, and the patient's ſtrength ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                  <p>Stimulants are here alſo required, as tincture of guaiac, 30 or 40 drops upon ſugar, and mixed with peppermint water, three or four times a day, or gum guaiac, made into a draught, with 30 or 40 drops of ſome volatile ſpirit, (No. 128.) or gum guaiac, and quick lime, equal quantities, well rubbed together—then lime water poured on, and when it has ſtood ſome time, decant the limpid part—to this add a few drops of any volatile ſpirit and it will mix with water without ſeparation—ſometimes there will appear an intermiſſion in the pains; and where, at the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:028021_0368_0FD67339178D57B8"/>
of the diſeaſe, there have been profuſe diſcharges by the ſkin, with a copious depoſition in the urine;—bark 193, (194.) is highly ſerviceable, united with volatile tincture of guaiacum, (180) and has been known to relieve very obſtinate caſes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in debilitated habits.</p>
                  <p>The CHRONIC RHEUMATISM chiefly affects old men, or thoſe who by indiſcretions have ſo weakened their conſtitutions, that they are reduced to that ſtandard. The attack of this is not ſo general, ſeldom affecting ſo many places at once; nor do the parts appear ſo red or ſwelled—it returns at intervals, without any fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile affections almoſt, or ſweat—and there are ſometimes tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the colour of the ſkin, or very ſlightly red, riſing in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts, rather round, of the ſize of a nut, affecting chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe of full habits, and women who have nor their men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>In full habits bleeding may be had recourſe to <hi>once</hi>—bliſters and ſudorifics are more uſeful—repeated purging expedites the cure.</p>
                  <p>Mercurials, joined with diophorets (No. 87.) are extremely efficacious—and alſo the addition of gum guaiacum to purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, (No. 19, 20.)—guaiacum given from day to day, ſo as to procure two or three ſtools every day, has been often attended with ſucceſs; or on the nights previous to giving a purge (No. 19, 20 21.) in the morning, calomel joined with guaiacum has been of great uſe, (No. 129.)—when the pain is excruciating, opiates (151.) may be given at night.</p>
                  <p>Volatiles, and opiates externally applied, are often attended with ſalutary effects, (No. 107.) or ſtimulating plaiſter, (No. 130.) ſufficient to create proper irritation over the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Oil of turpentine has been ſpoken of as an internal as well as external remedy, (No. 122.)</p>
                  <p>Electricity has been recommended for 15 days, a quarter of an hour each day, drawing the ſparks through the parts affected, and giving a few general ſhocks.</p>
                  <p>In order to prevent relapſes, a flannel ſhirt ſhould be worn next to the ſkin; compound decoction of ſarſaparilla with milk taken for a month; now and then the warm bath ſhould be had recourſe to, and at the proper ſeaſon ſea-bathing.</p>
                  <p>Some of theſe modes will be ſufficient in common caſes; but in ſuch as are more obſtinate, change of climate is very often requiſite, and alſo the natural hot baths—or in perſons whoſe vaſcular ſyſtem acts with freedom, nothing is more conducive to prevent it return than cold bathing.</p>
                  <p>In thoſe rheumatic complaints called SCIATICA, or HIP GOUT,
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:028021_0369_0FD673019C066C58"/>
and LUMBAGO, as they are of acute or chronic kind, ſo muſt they be treated in the ſame manner as we have ſpecified in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rheumatiſm—only in the hip-gout, when the diſeaſe has been obſtinate, an iſſue cut above, or below the knee, has been of great ſervice, as alſo bliſtering the thigh.</p>

                  <p>ſo called from the French word <hi>goutte,</hi> an acrid defluxion—in medical language it is called ARTHRITIS by many, from <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron,</hi> articulus, a joint, becauſe it affects the joints—by ſome PODAGRA, from <hi>pous,</hi> pes, the feet, and <hi>agra,</hi> captura, ſeizure, becauſe they conſider the feet as its natural ſeat—and though it is thought, that there is truly only one ſpecies, yet, according to the different appearances it puts on, it has been diſtinguiſhed—all which may very properly come under two heads—the REGU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAR, or FIXED—the IRREGULAR, or UNCERTAIN, GOUT, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the ſeat it occupies—both thoſe ſpecies, which we ſhall proceed to deſcribe, appear to depend upon the ſtrength or weakneſs of the whole, or ſome part or parts of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. Before the fit comes on, the patients moſt commonly experience a general laſſitude and wearineſs—are low-ſpirited—complain of a load and fullneſs of the ſtomach after eating—are ſqueamiſh very often, and throw up wind—the belly is diſtended with flatulence—the habit coſtive, the ſweating or moiſture of the feet goes off, and the veins there appear full.</p>
                  <p>After theſe an acute pain for the moſt part ſeizes the joint of the great toe, accompanied with a ſenſe of coldneſs, as if cold water was poured down—ſlight ſhiverings, and other febrile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections—a ſhooting, gnawing, pungent, or burning pain, ſeizes the ſmall bones of the foot, or they feel as if ſqueezed ſtrongly with the hand—in about twenty four hours, the part begins to look red, and ſwell—a gentle breathing ſweat comes on, and then the pain begins to decreaſe, and the fever diſappears.</p>
                  <p>In the morning patients find themſelves better, in the evening worſe, becauſe at that time the fit comes on—during the fit men become iraſcible, and are eaſily irritated—they have little or no appetite—the body is coſtive; and a painful ſenſation of the part accompanies the whole fit—on the firſt days the urine is high-coloured, and diſcovers a brick-coloured or red ſandy ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>In proportion as the conſtitution is ſtronger or weaker, ſo does the fit go off quicker or ſlower; at which time an intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

itching is perceived between the toes, and the ſcarf ſkin falls off in ſcales like bran,—the joints feel ſtiff as if they were covered with plaiſters and dry, and a period is put to the diſeaſe for ſome time—which again returns.</p>
                  <p>This is the caſe of the gout in its firſt attacks, ſo long as the conſtitution preſerves a proper degree of power; but in proceſs of time, as the habit becomes weaker, the complaint takes deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er root, the diſeaſe ſeizes the hands, wriſts, elbows, knees, and other parts—hard chalky tumours are formed, and the diſtorted limbs loſe all motion. At this period the fits continue almoſt the whole year, and the afflicted make large quantities of pale u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; they are alſo tormented with piles, putrid eructations, ſpaſmodic affections, ſtony concretions in the kidneys, gravelly complaints, and loſe all appetite.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrength of the conſtitution ſtill failing more and more, till it becomes almoſt exhauſted, the gouty matter, incapable of being thrown out upon the extremities, affects the internal parts of the ſyſtem, and produces complaints peculiar to thoſe parts from the ſtimulus it there occaſions—<hi>ſometimes upon the head,</hi> producing apoplexy, lethargy, palſy, delirium, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>This deſcription comprehends the gout in both its forms of regularity or irregularity—it being conſidered THE REGULAR GOUT, when it fixes upon <hi>the feet,</hi> and is attended with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtrong inflammation, continuing for ſome days, and gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going off, with ſwelling, itching, and peeling of the ſcarf-ſkin, in form of ſcales, like bran.</p>

                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, full, free, luxurious living—hard drinking, particularly acid and rough wines—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, or the omiſſion of accuſtomary exerciſe—relaxed, ſoft, and full habit—immoderate venery in youth—too ſudden chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from diſtilled liquors o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="375" facs="unknown:028021_0371_0FD67302EF36FD88"/>
and watery—ſuppreſſed evacuations—and an hereditary taint.</p>
                  <p>It ſeldom attacks boys, caſtratas, or women, except viragos, or ſuch as have paſſed the time of having the menſes; but moſt commonly men in the decline of life, thoſe of lively imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſtudious living a ſedentary life, and ſitting up late at night.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> CAUSE is, a peculiar humour elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively fixing in common upon the ſmall joints, or rather thin ligaments; or, perhaps, upon the membranous coverings of the nerves, there ſituated; or ſometimes in other parts of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, particularly thoſe which are the moſt irritable.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A diſeaſe accruing without any evident external cauſe; but having, for the moſt part, an unaccuſtomary affection of the ſtomach preceding the attack, and alſo febrile ſymptoms—a pain in the joints, and that moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the great toe, but <hi>certainly</hi> attacking chiefly the joints of the hands and feet—this pain returns at intervals, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten alternates with affections of the ſtomach and other internal parts.</p>
                  <p>Though we allow of two ſpecies of the gout, yet it is pretty obvious, that they depend only upon the different proportions of ſtrength in the conſtitution;—and this will regulate our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the mode of</p>
                  <p>CURE; and here are indicated a ſeparation and expulſion of the morbid matter, and a prevention of its return, or capability of reproducing its morbid effects—in all which we muſt be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the conſtitution. When the gout proceeds regularly, and fixes in the feet, patience and warm flannels are recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and the free uſe of wine allowed, under the idea of making the depoſition of the gouty matter more complete, and aſſiſting the local expulſion.</p>
                  <p>However, in the moſt ſimple and regular caſes, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a total prohibition of all medical aſſiſtance; nor can I think that large draughts of wine, and loads of flannel, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the loſs of <hi>judicious</hi> advice; for to me, who frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have experienced the gout, it is clear, that ſome things may be done without any riſque of preſent danger, or future miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which render the fit oftentimes leſs violent, ſhorten its continuance, and obviate the conſequent debility; for I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, we ſuffer more from conſtitutional defects,—the effects of ſymptoms,—and miſmanagement, than from the nature of the diſeaſe itſelf, particularly in thoſe who labour under recent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks—ſimilar inſtances we have ſeen in the treatment of other diſeaſes; as in the ſmall-pox, where warmth and cordials were inſtituted for the ſame purpoſe, of throwing off the morbid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

by which the fever was too highly increaſed, and deſtruction too often, and danger always the conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee who are the men moſt ſubject to this malady—hard drinkers, particularly wine-bibbers—men of voracious appetites, who feed on high-ſeaſoned diſhes—venereal devotees—men of lively imaginations, and thoſe addicted to ſevere ſtudy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>By theſe means may this painful diſeaſe be mitigated, or the painful conſequences often ſubdued, and always made leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; but if we would attempt the cure, we muſt try that in the periods where there is ſome long intermiſſions; and this by the preventive plan, (62. 97.) to which regimen there point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, ſtomachic and aromatic bitters ſhould be occaſionally taken, ſuch as quaſſia wood, (175.) or bark mixed with ſteel, (No. 61 to 65.) chalybeate waters, particularly thoſe of Bath—the ſkin ſhould be kept clean, and a flannel ſhirt worn next to it—a doſe of tincture of rhubarb, (173.) ſhould be taken twice a day;—and, in fine, ſuch things occaſionally applied to; as will contribute to ſtrengthen the ſtomach and digeſtive powers, keep up a free ſtate of perſpiration, and prevent the body from being coſtive.</p>

                  <p>Now, if the HEAD and LUNGS are affected, and the habit full of blood, we muſt bleed in proportion to the ſtrength and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—afterwards apply bliſters to the inſide of the thighs and legs—bathe the feet in decoctions of horſe-raddiſh and bruiſed muſtard-ſeed—ſome adviſe wine, or ſome other ſpirituous men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum—ſinapiſms (No. 30.) may alſo be applied to the feet—and we ſhould give volatile camphorated medicines, (No. 33. 35 to 37) and with cordials, (No. 13 to 18. 28 to 30.) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the motion of the blood, at the ſame time that it is ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to the extreme parts.</p>

            <head>SECTION XV. MORBID EVACUATIONS.</head>
            <p>WE muſt now proceed to treat of thoſe diſorders whoſe moſt ſtriking ſymptom is ſome evacuation, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not natural, exceeds the limits, or returns at more frequent periods, than what is uſual in a ſ4tate of health.</p>
            <p>Theſe may be properly divided into ſuch evacuations as flow from the bowels, called ALVINE, from <hi>alvus,</hi> the belly—SAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GUINARY, from ſanguis, the blood—called HAEMORRHAGES, from <hi>aima,</hi> ſanguis, and <hi>reo,</hi> fluo, to flow—and SEROUS, from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, or the thinner fluids, as lymph, urine, mucus, ſweat, and ſimilar fluids.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe evacuations are either ACTIVE or PASSIVE, ſimilar to what we have ſaid on inflammation. (298. 305.)—when they are ACTIVE, they are ſolicited by ſome morbid ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus, or medicines by which the excretory veſſels of the parts affected are put into ſtronger action, and throw out their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents too copiouſly, or the veſſels burſt, and from thence is the evacuation produced—when PASSIVE, the proper powers of the living machine do not excite, but become defective in reſiſtance, as in caſes, of a conſtant flux of urine from the relaxation of the ſphincter of the bladder. (51.)</p>
            <p>Of theſe truths we ſhall be convinced, if we conſider, that all the fluids of the human machine are contained in different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles, as bile, urine, &amp;c. and alſo that part of them are kept in perpetual motion, as the blood, &amp;c. part of them ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and excreted; ſome of which ſecretions flow out of the body in regular ſucceſſion, as the matter of perſpiration; ſome are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for a time, till nature calls them into motion for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar purpoſes, as milk, ſemen, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It will therefore appear obvious, that whenever the force of the impelled fluid, or the weight of it, when collected, is too powerful for the natural ſtrength of the veſſels or cavities, the veſſels which burſt, or the ſphincters by which they are guarded, and prevented from pouring out their contents, be opened; hence, when either the expulſive force of the contained liquid is too great, and the ſides of the veſſels too much weakened; or when the fluids are in too great quantity, and the ſphincters in too relaxed a ſtate, the rupture of the one, the want of contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile power of the other, will neceſſarily lay the foundation for the diſeaſe; ſo that it may ariſe either from an increaſe of the expulſive and decreaſe of two reſiſting power, or from them both
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:028021_0377_0FD6730774EBD618"/>
happening conjointly in the ſame habit, and at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>The indications of cure will then be, in ACTIVE EVACUATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS, to attempt to remove the morbid ſtimulus, and weaken the powers of the veſſels or cavities—in the PASSIVE, to ſtrengthen the veſſels or cavities, and give power to the ſphincters, that they may act with proper force.</p>

                  <head>§ 1. CHOLERA MORBUS, OR BILIOUS, VOMITING AND INTES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINAL FLUX.</head>
                  <p>The ſeat of this complaint ſeems to be the whole inteſtinal canal, particularly the ſtomach, head of the duodenum, (42.) and doctus communis choledochus, the common duct of the gall bladder. (36.)</p>
                  <p>And it is apt chiefly to attack ſuch as are of bilious, dry, choleric habits, or whoſe conſtitutions are loaded with ſcorbutic acrimony, or the firſt paſſages with acid humours, or are of iraſcible diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. Though this diſeaſe will ſometimes come on very ſuddenly, it is often preceded by heart-burn, a gnawing painful ſenſation of the ſtomach and bowels, and rancid eructa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—after which ſucceed enormous vomitings, and inteſtinal diſcharges of vitiated humours, bilious, green, yellow, and ſometimes black, with great difficulty and pain—there is alſo a violent pain and diſtention of the belly and inteſtines, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with thirſt—a pulſe at firſt full, ſtrong, and frequent, afterwards weak and irregular—heat, and anxiety—moreover there attends a nauſea extremely troubleſome—ſometimes a contraction of the legs and arms—an acute pain above the navel—retention of the urine—fainting—coldneſs of the extremities—the body becomes weak, and the ſpirits low—with other ſymptoms of a ſimilar nature, which greatly terrify the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and will deſtroy the patient in forty-eight hours.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe generally makes its appearance in autumn, more eſpecially after a hot and dry ſummer.</p>
                  <p>If the diſeaſe is more than commonly violent, the evacuations downwards are very numerous, amounting in the ſpace of a few hours to ninety or a hundred—the patients ſoon become e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maciated and reduced—and the ſymptoms above ſpecified are quickly followed by hiccough—univerſal convulſions—cold

ſweats—frequent ſwoonings—and either in one of theſe fits, or in a convulſed ſtate, when the diſeaſe proves fatal, they expire.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, eating of pork, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, fat meat fried in oil or butter—or ſweets, grapes, cherries, cucumbers, melons, or all ſuch viands as become readily rancid or acid—poiſons—ſtrong purgatives—violent rage—and acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious bile.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> conſtrictions of the ſtomach and ſmall inteſtines, particularly the duodenum, by bilious or acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious humours irritating and vellicating the ſenſible nervous coats, which cauſe an increaſe of action in theſe organs, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different ſymptoms, according to the parts locally or ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetically affected.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. An acute diſeaſe, attended with the vomiting of ſome humour, moſtly bilious or acrid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the ſame time a frequent inteſtinal evacuation, or at leaſt a nauſea and teneſmus, or frequent deſire to go to ſtool, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with anxiety, abdominal pains or gripings, and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpaſmodic contractions of the legs.</p>
                  <p>CURE.

<pb n="386" facs="unknown:028021_0382_0FD6734779DCB6B0"/>
mucous, thin, and ſerous, bloody, frothy, and often mixed with thin ſkin-like, or filamentous ſubſtances—the bowels are loaded with wind, which rolls about, and makes a conſiderable noiſe—and the patients are perpetually deſirous of going to ſtool—have a ſtrangury, and often a ſlipping down, or protruſion of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the rectum, (43.)—the loſs of ſtrength becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme—and whilſt the extremities are cold, they perceive in the interior parts great heat—then ſoon come on a hiccough, and cold ſweats.</p>
                  <p>At length the pain ſuddenly ceaſes—the faeces, extremely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, paſs away involuntarily—the pulſe becomes weak—the thirſt goes off—and, whilſt the unhappy patient is flattering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the hopes of recovery, from the apparent alleviation of the ſymptoms, he ſuddenly expires.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe, notwithſtanding it is often fatal to adults, but moſt of all to ſuch as are much advanced in life, ſtill in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants it is very mild; for they will be affected with the ſame diſeaſe for ſome months without any inconvenience, if it is left to the direction of nature.</p>
                  <p>Though the general progreſs of the diſeaſe is here deſcribed, practice demands as to make ſome neceſſary diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>If the dyſentery is of the INFLAMMATORY KIND, there will be a high degree of fever—hard full pulſe—extreme pain of the belly, which, on handling, increaſes, and, after vomiting is ſtill more diſtreſſing—the head aches—the countenance is fluſhed—ſometimes the belly is diſtended—in quantity the evacuations are ſmall.</p>
                  <p>If of the PUTRID KIND, there will be a bitter taſte in the mouth—ſhiverings now and then come on, as it purſues its courſe—the feveriſh affections are ſlight—the face pale—the evacuation matter variouſly coloured—beſides which, a bilious vomiting ſometimes accompanied with worms, is an aſſociate.</p>
                  <p>If of what is termed the MALIGNANT SORT, which it may be from the very beginning, or occaſioned by the milder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> degenerating from conſtitutional defect or miſmanagement—the pulſe is then weak—the ſtrength fails ſuddenly—the countenance has a cadaverous aſpect—the voice is weak—the head heavy-there is great oppreſſion at the pit of the ſtomach, attended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſlight convulſions, ſickneſs, and frequent fainting—and, now and then, eruptions of different kinds make their appearance, ſuch as thoſe of the miliary claſs, ſpots like flea-bites, and thruſh.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. It is ſuppoſed to ariſe from acrimonious matter of a putrid nature; becauſe it makes its appearance in moiſt warm ſeaſons, adapted to generate putreſcency, chiefly attacks thoſe of ſcorbutic habits, (61.) and originates from vapours of
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:028021_0383_0FD6730CB63E5E28"/>
putreſcent blood; particularly becauſe it ſoftens and corrupts the parts affected, generates air very copiouſly, and renders the faeces highly putrid; and alſo becauſe, on the diſſection of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies dying of this complaint, the inteſtines, eſpecially the colon and rectum, (43, 45.) are preternaturally thick, diſtended with air, inflamed, ulcerated, and in a mortified ſtate—the inner or villous coat abraded—the bile greeniſh like a leek, viſcid, and often of a black colour—and the blood very dark in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Of whatever nature this diſeaſe may be, the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are ſimilar, and depend upon evacuating the acrimony, or determining it to other places—weakening its action—allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the diſtreſſing ſymptoms, by rendering the inteſtines leſs ſenſible to its irritating effects, in its FIRST STAGES—in the LAST, recovering the tone, and giving ſtrength to the relaxed and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened veſſels.</p>
                  <p>To promote theſe purpoſes, in full habits, where there are apparent ſymptoms of inflammation, the patient ſhould be bled once or twice, according to their urgency, and the ſtrength of the patient.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, the ſtomach and inteſtines ſhould be unload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by emetics and cathartics—twelve grains of powdered ipeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuanha, and one of tartarized antimony, ſhould be well mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and divided into three parts, and one given every ſecond hear—no liquid ſhould be taken after the firſt doſe; but after the third, weak beef tea, or chicken broth, ſhould be drank liberally to encourage the vomiting—after which a ſlight opiate will be requiſite.</p>
                  <p>Should the emetic produce ſmart evacuations upwards and downwards, the ſucceeding day it is not neceſſary to order any thing except a grain of opium, mixed with three or four grains of ipecacuanha into pills, with ſyrup of white poppy heads, and given at bed-time.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould the emetic not have produced any purgative ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, a purging powder, made of thirty grains of rhubarb, and three of calomel, muſt be adminiſtered the morning following.—As for my own part, in the beginning of this complaint, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the oil of caſtor emulſion, (No. 66) as it relaxes the coats of the ſtomach, ſheaths the acrimony, produces evacuations, and mitigates the pains of the bowels.</p>
                  <p>But as is the nature of the diſeaſe, ſo ſhould be the election of our purgatives—if of the <hi>inflammatory kind,</hi> the ſalines are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable, (172,)—if the <hi>putreſcent,</hi> the antiſeptic, as tamarinds, cream of tartar,  (No. 23, 24. 50, 51.) but in every caſe,
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:028021_0384_0FD6734981A67858"/>
after the effects is produced, an opiate ſhould be adminiſtered at night.</p>
                  <p>In the intermediate ſpaces of time, ſmall doſes of nitre, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with antimonials and ſaline mixtures, may be exhibited, joined with ſheathing medicines, ſuch as gum tragacanth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>However, ſhould not the diſeaſe ſoon yield to this mode, but the ſymptoms ſtill continue, particularly griping and purging, ſmall doſes of ipecacuanha may be given, ſufficient only to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a nauſea, (No. 133.) increaſing or decreaſing the doſe agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the effects, and joining it with antiſeptics, cooling, or cordial medicines, as the particular nature of the caſe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                  <p>Should the ſtools continue remarkably viſcid and offenſive, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſecond or third day a purgative ſhould be given, and at night an opiate.</p>
                  <p>We muſt proceed in this manner, till, from the regularity of the pulſe, the ceſſation of pain, and propenſity to ſtools, as well as from the want of them, we may conclude the diſeaſe termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated—but ſhould not theſe appearances occur in the courſe of a few days, we have reaſon to apprehend the greateſt danger—we muſt then, if the ſymptoms continue as violent as at firſt, have recourſe to fomentations, (No. 111.) and glyſters of the ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and anodyne ſort, made of milk, broth, marſh-mallow or linſeed decoction, with ſtarch and tincture of opium.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the ipecacuanha, other medicines are recommended, and, if we believe the recommendation, falling little ſhort of <hi>infalibility,</hi> 
                     <abbr>viz.</abbr> form two to ten grains of created glaſs of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, from ten to fifteen grains of powdered columbo every three or four hours—the decoction of ſemirauba bark is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a <hi>ſpecific,</hi> and ſaid to remove the diſeaſe without the danger or inconveniencies attendant on aſtringents, (No. 134.)</p>

                  <p>In purſuing the modes here laid down, we ſhall ſeldom fail of curing this complaint; but ſhould it be accompanied with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid malignant fever, there will be little hope of a recovery—however, we ſhould try the effects of ANTISEPTICS, (192 to 194.) particularly wine, infuſions of bark and ſnake-root, with a few drops of tincture of opium in each doſe, and the free uſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacid fruits, (192.) taken by themſelves, or ſqueezed plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into other liquids—indeed, fruit, and things of a ſimilar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

will form, in theſe caſes, the proper plan of diet—but when dyſenteries are unattended with any high degree of putrefaction, demotions, and jellies of rice, ſago, tapioca, ſalep, the white de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, chalk mixture, weak chicken-broth or beef tea, are moſt proper—though all ſolid animal food muſt be avoided.</p>
                  <p>When flatulencies become diſtreſſing, which will ſometimes be the caſe, chamomile flower tea, infuſion of cinnamon or cloves, or liquids impregnated ſlightly with other aromatics, may be occaſionally adminiſtered with great advantage.</p>
                  <p>However, we have had inſtances of ſome of theſe complaints which were epidemical, and from their nature ſo extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, as exceeded the powers of medicine, ſuppoſed to be owing to their deducing their origin from acrimonious humours, highly cauſtic—in which a total loſs of ſtrength, ſwelling of the belly, ſinking of the pulſe, a diſcharge of blackiſh ſtools, and clammy ſweats, were certain ſigns of the irremediable ſtate of the diſeaſe.</p>

               <p>All theſe effuſions of blood are conſidered as morbid, which either flow from particular parts not naturally accuſtomed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch evacuations; or, though producing them periodically, ſtill afford them in too great quantity, or return at too quick periods, that the machine, by theſe means, is ſo injured, as to experience ſome defect in executing its functions properly, and conſequently falls into a diſeaſed ſtate, attended with a greater or leſs degree of danger, according to the violence of the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or to the conſequence of the part from whence it flows.</p>
               <p>Now all haemorrhages ariſe, either when the circulatory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive powers are increaſed to a great degree of violence; or that the reſiſtance of the blood on its part and the veſſels ſhould be diminiſhed; or that each of theſe things ſhould happen at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Hence, then, we find, that complaints of this nature may be occaſioned in four different ways—by the veſſels being ruptured, dilated, or eroded; or, by the blood having loſt its natural viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity, and becoming to thin—under any of theſe circumſtances, the veſſels not being capable of confining the blood within its proper channels, occaſion haemorrhage—whence ariſe a variety of theſe complaints, taking their names from the places from whence the blood iſſues; or the action of the parts producing, inſtead of their natural, theſe ſanguinary diſcharges.</p>

                  <p>DESCRIPTION. In this complaint, for the moſt part, a chillneſs—laſſitude—coldneſs of the feet—difficulty of breathing come on—a weight, or undulating ſenſation is felt about the diaphragm—fla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ence in the belly—and pain in the back—at length there comes on a tickling and itching in the windpipe, from whence iſſues forth blood—if it is recent, the colour is florid, the fluid frothy, and coughed up in large mouthfuls—but it is not always of a very florid colour—in ſome caſes it is of a blacker hue, as it remains and concretes more or leſs in the veſicles.</p>
                  <p>From the ſymptoms here enumerated it appears, that a ſpaſm of the whole machine takes place before the effuſion.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are ſaid to be, a fullneſs of blood, brought on by ſome accuſtomary evacuations being impeded, if, at the ſame time, the action of the veſſels ſhould be ſtrongly increaſed by anger, violent motion, living upon too hot food or liquids, or violent cough, ſhould the exertions in protruding the faeces in coſtive habits be too powerful—long expoſure to ſevere cold, cauſing a contraction on the ſurface of the body and the external veſſels, air poſſeſſing too much levity in very high ſituations, a ſuppreſſion of the menſes or piles, too great a rarefaction of the blood, ſpaſmodic contractions of ſome of the viſcera, ſcirrhus obſtructions in the neighbouring viſcera, or a ſcirrhus or polypus in the veſſels of the lungs themſelves—or, in fine, whatever determines too large a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to the lungs, and cauſes it to circulate too forcibly againſt the veſſels which are not obſtructed, or ſome diſeaſes which break down the texture of the blood, or erode the veſſels, as ſcurvy, pulmonary conſumption, ſmall-pox, or thoſe depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a putreſcent acrimony of the fluids.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe which are <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> we have before enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated,
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:028021_0388_0FD6734AF0EFADF0"/>
(622, 623.) but moſt commonly it is a rupture of the veſſels preceded by an univerſal ſpaſm.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A fluſhing of the cheeks, ſenſation of uneaſineſs, or pain, ſometimes heat in the breaſt, a tickling of the fauces, cough, and throwing up of florid coloured blood, often frothy.</p>
                  <p>People moſt ſubject to this complaint are thoſe of ſlender, delicate frames, who have long necks, are narrow cheſted, whoſe blood is acrid and copious, and are between twenty-five and thirty years old.</p>
                  <p>CURE.—This diſeaſe is always to be conſidered of a very dangerous nature, and requires very early and effectual aſſiſtance—in doing which, we muſt endeavour to ſolicit the blood from the lungs, moderate its heat, take off the external ſpaſmodic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and heal the veſſels, if ruptured.—If then it proceeds from too great fullneſs we muſt have recourſe to bleeding, in proper quantities, and at ſuch intervals as the neceſſity of the caſe demands—all animal food muſt be prohibited, even the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt broths—<hi>and the diet ſhould be by no means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>The mind of the patient ſhould be kept perfectly at eaſe—and the firſt and ſecond bleeding ſhould be copious, from large ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and quickly repeated, if the violence of the caſe requires it—for one free bleeding in this ſtage is of infinitely more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice than a number of ſparing ones.</p>
                  <p>Nitre ſhould be given freely in any eligible form, as it is much to be depended upon; for it leſſens the motion of the blood, and allays its heat, conſequently prevents ſtrong vaſcular action, and the expanſive power of the blood.</p>
                  <p>Keeping the body open with cooling aperients, (171, 172.) particularly Glauber's ſalts largely diluted, (No. 135.) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely uſeful, taken now and then, till the effect is produced twice, or oftener.</p>

medicines, (No. 81 to 84) to which nitre may be added, and given to allay the pulmonic irritation.</p>
                  <p>This method in common and recent caſes will almoſt always ſucceed; but when it proceeds from previous injury in the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the blood, and weakneſs of the lungs, conſtituting that kind which is habitual or conſumptive, little can be expected from bleeding; for this, by weakening the ſyſtem, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting more to diſſolve the texture of the blood, ſeems rather calculated to increaſe the miſchief, inaſmuch as it adds power to its cauſes; ſmall doſes of antimonials, (180.) or ipecacuanha, (180.) are moſt likely to produce good effects, by determining the flow of blood to the ſurface, and demulcents, (188.) by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the viſcidity of the fluids.</p>
                  <p>And ſhould the pain, difficulty of breathing, and cough, ceaſe with the efflux of blood, we may give tonic medicines, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of bark, (193.) to which may be added the balſam of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pivi, (165.) or ſome of the mild balſamic claſs; for we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably infer, that there is no more extravaſated fluids in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary veſicles.</p>
                  <p>But it ſometimes happens unfortunately, notwithſtanding all our efforts, that though the efflux of blood may be ſtopped for a few hours, or days, it will return with a quick hard pulſe, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome cough, oppreſſion, and difficulty of breathing, then we may have reaſon to be alarmed, and fear a ſupervening conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—in this caſe we have little to depend upon but general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, ſuch as goats whey, aſs' milk mixed with Seltzer water—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The characteriſtic marks of this diſeaſe are, frequent nauſea or efforts to vomit, and at the ſame time a rejection of bloody materials by the mouth, mixed with ſuch as have before been ſwallowed—from whence the ſtomach feels ſome alleviation; but the blood vomited up is grumous—and the ſtools which ſucceed afterwards are black.</p>
                  <p>This affection, however, is more common to women than to men, and leſs frequent in both than the making of bloody urine,—If a women in this diſeaſe ſhould menſtruate, ſhe is cured; for it often is occaſioned by a ſuppreſſion of the menſes—and in men, from an obſtruction of the bleeding piles, and alſo from infarction of the liver and ſpleen—ſtill it may be occaſioned by other cauſes; ſuch as full and free living—ſwallowing down conſtantly large quantities of ſucculent or juicy food, at the ſame time indulging in indolence—and the blood puſhed for wards in the courſe of circulation too rapidly, by ſevere exerciſe, running, riding, fits of anger, and the too free uſe of vinous and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors.</p>
                  <p>CURE. In theſe caſes, though bleeding may be ſometimes neceſſary, it muſt be cautiouſly repeated—we muſt be governed
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:028021_0391_0FD673153698F590"/>
by the ſtrength of the patient, which is ſometimes apt to fail ſuddenly—the pulſe readily flags;—the ſanguinary flux is apt to be extremely copious, and often occaſions fainting—Nor ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing be given that is likely, in the leaſt degree, to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the ſtomach.—As therefore it is eſſentially neceſſary to have the body kept open, we muſt depend upon glyſters chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—though rhubarb in ſmall doſes, <hi>if the ſtomach will bear it,</hi> has been recommended.</p>
                  <p>Weak, broths, with ſome of the aſtringent vegetables unboil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;—ſuch as plantain—ground ivy—cup-moſs—nettles—or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their expreſſed juice, may be given—infuſion of red roſes—ſloes—or cold water, acidulated with the vitriolic acid—may be adminiſtered as drink—alſo ices—and at night gentle opiates, mixed with aſtringents of the milder claſs;—avoiding all thoſe which are likely to create nauſea—ſuch as alum, white vitriol, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In all the different ſpecies of this complaint it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to proceed in this manner.—But if the ſuppreſſion of the menſes, or of the bleeding piles, ſhould be the cauſe, theſe are to be ſolicited to their natural paſſages by proper means; or ſhould they ariſe from affections of the liver, or ſpleen, ſuch medicines ſhould be exhibited as are calculated to relieve them as much as the ſtate of the ſtomach will permit.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt obſerve, that in the middle of pregnancy, they are rarely injurious; but if in fever, they are always fatal, if the blood be black and fetid; nor ſhould we flatter ourſelves with much hope, if they proceed from enlargements of the ſpleen, or liver, and induration, or ſhould there be fainting to any degree of ſeverity.</p>

                  <p>In this complaint, the matter paſſed through the urethra is either pure blood, or bloody urine, that is, urine having acquired intenſe redneſs from being mixed with ſome particles of blood. The moſt common cauſes of which are ſtones, or gravel lacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the different parts of the urinary paſſages; but it may be occaſioned by venereal exceſſes, as blood may iſſue from the ſeminal veſſels (two membranaceous cellular tubes, lying on each ſide, between the bladder, (50.) and rectum, (45.) on the outſide of the vaſa deferentia, (53.) and alſo from the proſtate glands; (54.) hence are they conſidered amongſt the cauſes, as are alſo diſſolution of the blood, or violent exertions of the

circulatory powers, in ſevere inflammatory fevers, particularly in the ſmall-pox.</p>
                  <p>Whatever may be the cauſe, two points are to be conſidered, whether there is an <hi>inflammatory,</hi> or, <hi>putrefactive</hi> diſpoſition in the blood.</p>
                  <p>If the former is prevalent, and the habit full, we muſt bleed, and that repeatedly, till we have taken off the general plenitude, and allayed the intenſeneſs of the action of the vaſcular ſyſtem, the bowels ſhould be kept open with ſaline purges and manna, (172.) and emulſions with gum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>If the SECOND,—tonics—aſtringents—and balſamics—as bark—lime water—tincture of roſes—alum whey ſhould be had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, to reſtrain, as quickly as poſſible, the efflux of blood—and by continuing afterwards the uſe of the bark, joined with the balſam of capivi—drinking chalybeate waters, and uſing a milk diet, endeavouring to ſtrengthen the tone of the ſyſtem, and prevent a relapſe.</p>
                  <p>But without either of the conſtitutional tendencies above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, ſhould the cauſe be a ſuppreſſion of menſes, or piles, and theſe cannot be reſtored or ſolicited to their natural paſſages—occaſional bleeding will be a ſalutary ſubſtitute.</p>
                  <p>Or ſhould it deduce its origin only from calculi, during the fits of pain we muſt guard the parts againſt the effects of their ſtimulus, by emollient and demulcent remedies, (140—187.)—aetherial ſpirits of nitre, and ſuch like—afterwards we muſt endeavour to ſtrike at the cauſe, as recommended in pain of the kidneys. (364.)</p>
                  <p>Here we muſt obſerve, that in all caſes of great pain, opiates ſhould not be forgot, eſpecially if ſtone or gravel is the cauſe—and, indeed, in diſcharges from the ureters, and kidneys, the infuſion of carrot-ſeed (No. 123) has not been ſlightly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                  <p>But in all caſes of bloody urine, all powerful aſtringents ſhould be induſtriouſly avoided, leſt they ſhould produce too ſtrong a conſtriction of the paſſages, and from thence coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted blood might be reſtrained, productive of inflammation, or forming a nucleus, or baſis for a ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the urine will appear to be extremely high-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, as if blood had been mixed with it—of this it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be certain;—which may be diſcovered by ſtraining the urine through fine linen—perfectly clean—if there ſhould be

                  <p>They are not always, however, to be conſidered as a diſeaſe, for they are a very ſalutary diſcharge, and ſometimes periodic, preventing a number of other complaints, which are apt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, on their being imprudently expelled, or ſtopped.—I have known people, from this cauſe, labour ſometimes under a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of internal affections, which have all vaniſhed on their re-appearance.

Hence, whilſt they continue moderate, and appear to be a ſalutary effort of a nature to relieve herſelf from ſome ſuperfluous load—there is no need of medical aſſiſtance. But if they are extremely and conſtantly painful, or pour forth a large quantity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> blood, ſo that the patient experiences great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and grows thin, they then may be conſidered as morbid.</p>
                  <p>Theſe who are diſpoſed to become corpulent, eat, and drink freely;—whoſe habits are relaxed—coſtive—plethoric—from indolence, or any other cauſe, are moſt liable to this complaint; beſides, ſtrong purges will alſo bring them on. Theſe cauſes induce obſtruction in, inflammation, and ſwelling of, thoſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels called haemorrhoidal; whence, about the anus, there will be livid, painful tubercles; from which frequently iſſue blood, which alſo ſometimes flows without any viſible tumour, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often with a load, and pain of the head, giddineſs, and pain of the loins and anus.</p>
                  <p>CURE. <hi>When there is no efflux of blood, from the piles;</hi> they are generally attended with ſuch great degrees of pain, that people are afraid of going to ſtool. Under theſe circumſtances, if people are of full habits, bleeding, abſtemious diet, and mild aperients—(No. 3. 22 to 24. 66. 135, or 136.) to take off

the fullneſs, and preventive coſtiveneſs, ſhould be had recourſe to,—after, warm olive oil may be applied to the part—or diluted preparations of lead (139) with camphorated ſpirits and lime wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;—juice of houſeleek—to any of which may be added tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of opium. The patient ſhould, as much as poſſible, be kept in a recumbent poſture; and, when ſitting up, avoid preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on the parts—or heating them—for which purpoſe a chair, ſtuffed round the edges, with a vacuity left in the center, ſhould be uſed.</p>
                  <p>The diet ſhould be of the mild laxative, emollient kind, nor any thing taken which can heat, or cauſe the blood to circulate with too great freedom.</p>
                  <p>WHEN THE PILES ARE OF THE BLEEDING SORT, and it becomes neceſſary to ſtop the flux of blood, cloths dipped in vinegar and water may be applied to the loins, and anus, which failing, or not ſoon ſucceding, a gentle emetic may be adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, (No. 11.) and after the operation, the anodyne draught, (No. 4.)</p>
                  <p>In theſe caſes, the indications of cure are very obvious. To take off the ſuperincumbent preſſure from, and leſſon the action of the veſſels, towards the affected part; to ſtrengthen the tone of the veſſels relaxed, and take off local irritation.</p>
                  <p>But as theſe diſcharges are brought on by infarctions and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the liver, other things are neceſſary to be done, in order to prevent a relapſe; for under theſe circumſtances pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients are liable to frequent returns; hence, in order to remove the cauſes, we muſt have recourſe to ſuch medicines and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as have been adviſed in pain of the liver from thoſe ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces—(Page 351.)</p>
                  <p>Sometimes this diſeaſe will ariſe merely from want of ſtrength, and tone in the rectum, (46.)—Preparations of iron, (139.) unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bitters, as quaſſia wood—gentian—chamomile—and ſuch like, and continued for ſome time, are highly beneficial,—and bathing the parts with a ſponge dipped in cold water, twice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day.—And in every ſpecies we muſt carefully avoid all aloetic aperients—for they are too apt to ſtimulate the rectum,—nay, rhubarb will ſometimes have this effect; hence, as it is of the utmoſt conſequence to keep the body open, ſhould there be occaſion, and that moderately; for ſtrong purging will exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, rather than alleviate the complaint, the gentleſt aperients, (171, 172.) ſhould only be inſiſted upon, and thoſe given in ſuch quantities, and at ſuch intervals, as merely to keep the bowels empty. This diſeaſe has been obſerved alſo to originate from exceſs of grief, long continued, as well as from a profuſion of the menſtrual diſcharge—and moſt probably is cauſed by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:028021_0395_0FD6731990A65058"/>
relaxation of the ſolids, brought on by a torpid ſtate of the nervous ſyſtem; whence the fluids, deprived of proper circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the inactivity of the vaſcular propulſive power, form congeſtions, which fix in theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>Changing the ſcenes of life—travelling—diſſipating gloomy ideas by ſeeing new objects—and diverting the attention, are amongſt the beſt calculated remedies, in theſe caſes—which have been greatly aided by taking four ſpoonfuls, three or four times a day, of bark infuſed in lime-water. (No. 137.)</p>
                  <p>Where the piles have continued a long time, occaſioned by a continued acrimonious looſeneſs, I have known them cured by gentle vomits—ſmall doſes of ipecacuanha in a ſtrong decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nettles and opiates—adminiſtering after the pain had ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the looſeneſs perceptibly abated, bark joined with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeates.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> an increaſe of action of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory veſſels of the kidneys, ariſing from a ſtate of relaxation, and a thin acrid ſeroſity of the circulating fluids, and a too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful determination of them to the kidneys.</p>
                  <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A preternatural diſcharge of urine, immoderate in quantity, and of long continuance, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended commonly with loſs of appetite, emaciation, and hectic ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>CURE. The indications are, to leſſen the action of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory veſſels, by altering their relaxed ſtate, and correcting the too great ſeroſity and acrimony of the fluids—hence we muſt apply to the uſe of inſpiſſants, diaphoretics, ſtimulants, and tonics—and as ſoliciting a flow of liquids to the ſkin will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent too great a determination to the kidneys, in order to keep a free and conſtant ſtate of perſpiration, the patient ſhould wear a flannel ſhirt next the ſkin, uſe moderate exerciſe, and dry friction.</p>
                  <p>Alum whey is ſtrongly recommended, (No. 138.) four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be taken at leaſt three times a day—lime-water drank alſo, whilſt the warmth in quenching continues, taken as freely as the thirſt requires, has been ſaid to exceed the uſe of Briſtol water, which by ſome has been conſidered as a ſpecific in this diſeaſe—half an ounce, or ſix drams of oak bark infuſed in two pints of lime-water, and the chalybeate waters, have had their powerful advocates.</p>
                  <p>White vitriol is a uſeful aſtringent, (139.) but ſome depend on half a grain of blue vitriol given twice a day in any proper liquid.</p>
                  <p>Preparations of iron, (139.) or elixir of vitriol joined with bark, (193, 194.) are no inferior tonics; and, by ſtrengthening the habit, contribute much in the promotion of perſpiration.</p>
                  <p>

Rhubarb, (173.) has been recommended as efficacious in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundation for the ſucceſs of antiſpaſmodics.</p>
                  <p>As a ſtimulant, tincture of cantharides, (175.) is by ſome in this caſe looked upon as a ſpecific.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the thirſt is a very diſtreſſing ſymptom, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous liquids ſhould be avoided—they ſhould be impregnated with ſome inſpiſſating ingredient, as comfrey-root, or made with lime; and theſe ſhould be uſed as common drink—boiled meat is leſs uſeful than roaſted—broth made of beef may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed—ſhell-fiſh—wild fowl—jellies in ſmall quantities, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated—tapioca, milk, rice gruels, and ſuch ſimilar viands, may be permitted.</p>
                  <p>Opiates alſo at night will be ſerviceable given with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of iron and diaphoretics. (No. 139.)</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe ſometimes affects hyſteric patients, who paſs large quantities of limpid urine; hence it is called <hi>hyſtericus</hi>—ſometimes it ſupervenes intermittents; hence denominated <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittens</hi>—ſometimes it attacks people worn out by the gout, in whom, during the painful fits, the urine is ſmall in quantity, and turbid; but in the intervals of the diſcharge, from perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration being defective, becomes clear, watery, and copious.</p>
                  <p>To the general plan, which we have before laid down, we muſt therefore ſubjoin antiſpaſmodics, under the firſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance—under the ſecond, tonics, particularly bark—and under the third, invigorating cordials, agreeable to the ſpecific nature of the caſe.

                  <p>CURE. Here are indicated a diverſion of the flow of fluids, a decreaſe of their ferocity, and our endeavours to give general force and tone to the ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>Hence purgatives, at proper intervals, will anſwer the firſt and ſecond indications—tonics and ſtrengthening medicines the laſt, ſuch as preparations of iron, bark, bitters; ſteel waters, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exerciſe, and the uſe of the cold bath—to which we would add, the frequent adminiſtration of milk.</p>
                  <p>Properly ſupporting, and judiciouſly increaſing the alvine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, are in this caſe extremely beneficial; for theſe divert the flow of fluids from the ſkin, as in the former caſe increaſing perſpiration ſolicited the humours from their determination to the kidneys.</p>
                  <p>When this complaint ariſes, as it ſometimes does, from a ſcorbutic acrimony, and the blood being in a looſe diſſolved ſtate, which is very often ſucceeded by that ſpecies of conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion called ATROPHY—the ſweat pours forth in the middle of winter under the ſlighteſt covering, and at the ſame time affects the patients with reſtleſſneſs and anxiety; nor do they ceaſe till the vitiated humours are in a great meaſure diſcharged by this cuticular flux.</p>
                  <p>Here, as well as where the ſweats are of different colours, the remedies recommended are, the juices of freſh vegetables, ſubacid fruits, and the uſe of tonics, particularly bark.</p>

               <div n="1" type="disease">
                  <head>§ 1. TETANUS;</head>
                  <p>SO called from the Greek word <hi>teino,</hi> firmo—and its varieties—EMPROSTHOTONOS—from <hi>emproſthon,</hi> ante, before—<hi>epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,</hi> pone, behind—and TRISMUS, from <hi>trizo,</hi> ſtridor. Theſe are marked by different appearances ariſing from ſimilar cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="415" facs="unknown:028021_0411_0FD67396B2F32AC8"/>
The TETANUS—is a ſpaſtic rigidity of the whole body—commonly continued—and involuntary; if it is bent forwards it is called EMPROSTHOTONOS—if backwards, OPISTHOTONOS—when the jaws are fixed cloſe, TRISMUS, or locked jaw.</p>
                  <p>This complaint is moſt commonly met with in hot countries, where it is conſidered as endemial, particularly in rainy ſeaſons ſucceeding thoſe which are hot, or in ſuch where there are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den changes from extreme heat to extreme cold, as in South Carolina—among thoſe who imprudently expoſe themſelves to the night air.—In the more temperate countries it is very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met with as an original diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. In tetanus the body grows ſtiff, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears like a ſpecies of wood, from the equable contractility of the muſcles before and behind—a ſpaſmodic affection is felt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the breaſt bone, verging to the ſpine—when the ſpaſms are violent, moſt acute pains come on—the face is red and diſtort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—the cheeks are drawn backwards—the eyes fixed—the jaw ſometimes locked—the pulſe moſt frequently is ſlower than what is natural—and ſhould blood be taken, its texture appears to be leſs firm—there is much difficulty in reſpiration—the body is coſtive—the natural actions only are not ſuppreſſed, and the ſenſes both external and internal, remain perfect—the ribs curve inwards—and if the diſeaſe ſhould be conquered, the patient continues a long time in a ſtate of great debility.</p>
                  <p>In the two ſucceeding varieties, the neck at firſt becomes immoveable—afterwards, by ſtrong ſpaſms, it is drawn either backwards or forwards—the motion of the jaw and the act of ſwallowing are impeded—the ſpaſm under the breaſt-bone brings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> others which are more violent—the pulſe is ſometimes ſlow and hard—at others ſmall, fluctuating, and irregular—the tongue grows rigid—a bloody kind of froth iſſues from the mouth—the muſcles of the ſpine and inferior extremities are drawn into ſimilar action—at length, either by the ſpaſms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more violent, or from an epileptic attack, the unhappy patient expires.—In the third variety, the diſtinguiſhing ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is, a ſtrong contraction of the muſcles which elevate the lower jaw.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſeaſes are of the moſt dangerous nature, as very few ſurvive the third day, without they come on gradually; and in that caſe, if the patient can get over nine or ten days, there is a greater chance of a recovery—hence, from the manner of the attack, it is that we are to eſtimate the degrees of danger.</p>
                  <p>CURE. The indications here, are to take off as ſpeedily as poſſible the ſpaſmodic affections, and afterwards to give tone
<pb n="416" facs="unknown:028021_0412_0FD67364BB2B3B68"/>
to the ſyſtem—and theſe are done chiefly by the bold admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of opium, and the warm bath; for opium given in this way has been known to cure when every other remedy has been tried in vain.</p>
                  <p>The quantity of opium to be given at a doſe, and its repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, depend upon the violence of the ſpaſms—therefore, from one or two to five grains may be given every hour in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient vehicle, and the doſe may, according to the urgency of the ſymptoms, be occaſionally increaſed; for in theſe caſes it never ſtupifies—it may be advantageouſly uſed with other ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modics, particularly aſafoetida or muſk; and theſe likewiſe muſt be freely exhibited: glyſters alſo of opium diſſolved may be thrown into the inteſtines, joined with oil or turpentine, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the yolk of an egg; and theſe muſt be often repeated, particularly if there is any difficulty of ſwallowing, or the jaws are cloſed.</p>
                  <p>The body muſt, if poſſible, be kept open by doſes of manna, Polychreſt, Glauber's, or Rochelle ſalt, or that of Epſom, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into emulſions, with oil of almonds and tincture of ſenna—or caſtor oil will, perhaps, better anſwer the purpoſe. (See No. 97, 98, 99, 118.)</p>
                  <p>With regard to warm bathing, thoſe who recommend it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the patient to lie along the bath, and, whilſt they are in it, frictions uſed—when taken out, to be wrapped up wet as they are in warm blankets, and put to bed, having, whilſt there, the abdomen fomented, and a bladder full of warm water laid upon the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p>The copious exhibition of bark and wine, two or three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the former, and from two to three pints of the latter, in the ſpace of twenty-four hours, have, from their ſucceſs, been recommended; along with which a bliſter was applied to the back, and two or three ounces of mercurial ointment rubbed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the throat, in the ſpace of ten days.</p>
                  <p>Cold bathing has alſo been uſed with ſome efficacy, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to anſwer, though the patients were plunged into the water during the violence of the fits of pain and ſpaſm.—Oil of amber and flowers of zinc have been recommended amongſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful antiſpaſmodics in theſe caſes</p>
                  <p>From the very different methods uſed by practitioners i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> theſe complaints, which ſeem, according to our conceptions, to produce ſuch oppoſite actions on the habit, and both proving ſucceſsful, I ſhould conclude, that the nature of the habit conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the neceſſity for this deviation.</p>
                  <p>In conſtitutions, therefore, which were athletic and robuſt,
<pb n="417" facs="unknown:028021_0413_0FD6739A22CECFF8"/>
with a hard full pulſe, I ſhould not heſitate to bleed, and have recourſe to the ſedative mode of opium, joined with antiſpaſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dics, and warm bathing.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch as were relaxed, and ſhewed evident ſigns of debility, to the ſtimulant and ſtrengthening: of bark and wine, joined with antiſpaſmodics—bliſtering—and the cold bath—and in both, to the local application of mercurial inunction.</p>
                  <p>And when it proceeded from any local affections, out off all communication between the part affected and the common ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorium, by dividing the nerve, or amputating the part; for this has proved ſucceſsful, by removing the irritable cauſe, which ſympathetically induces ſuch dangerous ſpaſmodic affections—and in caſes of locked jaw, a bliſter ſhould be applied to the throat.</p>
                  <p>After the diſeaſe is conquered, in order to prevent a relapſe, and recruit the ſtrength of the patient, we ſhould have recourſe to bark and chalybeates, cold, or ſea bathing, and ſuch other modes as we have formerly recommended to people recovering from other ſevere diſeaſes.</p>

The attack of an epilepſy is ſomething like that of an apoplexy, the patient falls down ſuddenly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but then they do not, as in an apoplexy, lie quiet, as if in a profound ſleep—in this it is quite the reverſe, for the whole muſcular ſyſtem is agitated by ſuch violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions, that it is almoſt impoſſible for the attendants to prevent the unfortunate afflicted from hurting themſelves—and ſhould, during the violence of the paroxyſm, the tongue be caught betwixt the teeth, it will be much wounded, bit through, or, perhaps, a portion bit off.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the urine, faeces, and ſemen, from the violence of the convulſions, will be forced from the places where they are depoſited, and blood will pour from the veſſels of the noſe and ears; beſides, there is for the moſt part, a good deal of froth foams from the mouth, even in the more ſlight attacks;—as ſoon, however, as the convulſions ceaſe, the patients lie quiet, as if aſleep; and, in about an hour or two, recover their ſenſes,
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:028021_0415_0FD6739B40508D18"/>
feel ſore and fatigued, yet ſtill are forgetful of all which has paſſed.</p>
                  <p>Some people have been ſo expert, as to counterfeit theſe fits ſo well, that inattentive obſervers, though medical practitioners, have been deceived—but we muſt remark, <hi>that a total depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſenſe and feeling</hi> diſtinguiſh the true epilepſy—if, then, by the application of ſtrong volatile ſubſtances to the noſe, or ſuddenly pricking ſome ſenſible part, without mentioning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they ſhew evident ſigns of feeling, the deception may be made obvious.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, before the fit comes on, it will be preceded by wearineſs, ſtupor, head-ach, or giddineſs affecting the ſight—ringing in the ears—frightful dreams, palpitation of the heart, difficulty of breathing—a fullneſs of, and rumbling noiſe in, the belly—the patients alſo will make larger quantities of limpid urine than uſual—ſtammer in their ſpeech, their countenance will be pale, their extremities cold, and complain of a ſenſation of cold air aſcending to the head.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, wounds, blows, and fractures of the ſkull—any fluid deluging the brain, or filling the ventricles—an inflammation or mortification off the brain—indurations there, or in the membranes—concretions or polypi within the cavity of the ſkull, carries of the internal ſurface of the ſkull—projections of the bony ſubſtance preſſing upon the brain—eroſions, lacerations, or wounds of the nerves—the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of accuſtomary evacuation, too great fullneſs or emptineſs of the vaſcular ſyſtem—ſtrong paſſions or affections of the mind, particularly ſudden and ſevere frights—noxious particles taken into the machine—poiſons, or an hereditary taint; for few diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes it is allowed, are ſo hereditary as this, as it is ſo eaſily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from parents to their offspring. For the <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate cauſes,</hi> ſee what has been ſaid in treating of convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

                     </gap>bſervient to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion—with a deprivation of all ſenſation, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in a ſtate of inſenſibility and apparent ſleep—to which, according to the opinion of ſome authors, may be added, a foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mouth, and a ſtrong compreſſion of the thumbs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the other fingers; for theſe two are by them conſidered the certain ſymptoms of this diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>CURE. As ſeveral of the preciſe cauſes cannot before death be diſcovered; or were they, <hi>they</hi> would be irremediable—we muſt content ourſelves with general modes of cure, and depend upon thoſe applications which have, in a variety of caſes from
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:028021_0416_0FD6736770783BD0"/>
experience, proved ſucceſsful—but where the cauſes are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, and within the reach of our art, they muſt be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly adverted to, and removed.</p>
                  <p>In this complaint, from undiſcoverable cauſes, a variety of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, chiefly empirical, have been recommended—<hi>animal oil, oil of amber,</hi> (150.)—<hi>flowers of lady's ſmock,</hi> twenty grains, increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thirty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>According to different conſtitutional circumſtances various methods have been recommended.</p>
                  <p>1ſt, Where the fluids have been acrimonious—or, 2d, in a ſtate of fullneſs—3d, ſubject to affections of the ſtomach, from indigeſtion or foulneſs—or, 4th, irritation of the inteſtines, from worms or other acrid materials.</p>
                  <p>In the FIRST caſe, courſes of <hi>mineral waters,</hi> which beſt agree with the conſtitution—<hi>goat's whey—ſea-water—with cold bathing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the SECOND. <hi>iſſues</hi> between the ſhoulders, or on the inſide of the thighs—<hi>ſetons</hi> in the neck—<hi>occaſional bleeding</hi>—and the body ſhould always be kept open.</p>
                  <p>In the THIRD, <hi>emetics</hi> given now and then; for they are of ſervice, not only by unloading the ſtomach, but giving a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhock to the habit; and ſeem calculated to remove irritation from acrid materials on the origin of the nerves and ſpinal mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or from the dura mater, (26.) which is ſuppoſed to be the immediate ſeat of this complaint.</p>
                  <p>In the FOURTH, purgatives, joined with calomel, ſhould be adminiſtered occaſionally, intermediately giving anthelmintics. (196.)</p>
                  <p>The mind, at the ſame time, muſt be kept free from any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy ſenſation or unruly paſſion—the diet ſhould be light, and eaſily digeſtible—gentle exerciſe—free, clear air, and whatever will conduce to preſerve an equable circulation of the blood, and keep up perſpiration, ought not by any means to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for where there is a prediſpoſition to convulſive attacks, any irregularity is greatly conducive to occaſion a renewal.</p>
                  <p>If the fits ſhould be of long duration, muſtard poultices and bliſters are adviſed—thruſting a wedge between the teeth to keep the mouth open—this laſt is ſaid to prevent even the fit, if applied on any warning being given before the fit comes on.</p>
                  <p>When uneaſy ſenſations are felt in the toes, feet, or legs, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

upwards, ligatures below the knee in theſe caſes have been knowe to prevent the fit—or, in whatever part theſe affections may be perceived, applying ligatures above the part ſo affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Some, however, adviſe, during the fit, not any thing to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, except preventing the patients from hurting themſelves, by getting the tongue between the teeth; and they are of opinion, little can be done to ſhorten the paroxyſm.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the moſt effectual remedies, I have generally thought muſk, and have uſed it with ſucceſs, joined with diaphoretics and tonics—and, in order to prevent the acceſſion or return, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional emetics and aperients.</p>
                  <p>Inveterate and habitual epilepſies are irremediable, as is that alſo which is hereditary, if it continues longer than the age of twenty-five.</p>
                  <p>That ſpecies callee the HYSTERIC, or UTERINE EPILEPSY, is diſtinguiſhed from the ſex of the patient, from its being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with, or preceded by, hyſteric affection—by its following the time of the menſes, at its periods—or being brought on by fear, or ſome ſuch ſimilar cauſe—and by ſenſation during the fit, being extremely obſcure, though not altogether ſuppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>SYDENHAM ſays, in this complaint the patients exert unuſual ſtrength, bawl out incoherently and inarticulately, and ſmite their breaſt; and that women moſt ſubject to this diſeaſe, are thoſe who have an uncommonly ſanguineous habit, and are high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.</p>
                  <p>Obſtructed menſes are generally accounted a cauſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which makes its appearance agreeable with the periods of this diſcharge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Should it happen during the flux,</hi> beſides thoſe things indicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their diſcharge and painful excretion, volatile and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tihyſteric remedies are required, ſuch as oil of amber, ſpirits of vitriolic aether, caſtor or animal oil liquor of hartſhorn, camphor, muſk, &amp;c.

               <p>THE nervous diſeaſes of which we have before treated are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly of the active ſort; but there are others which are aſſociated with inactivity, with reſpect to muſcular motion, and conſtitute a claſs of diſeaſes oppoſite to the former. Theſe are ranked by authors under the terms DEBILITIES and PRIVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS; becauſe of the loſs of, or weakened action of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar powers in the conſtitution, which are the diſtinguiſhing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics of theſe diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Dr. CULLEN arranges theſe under nervous diſeaſes; and are known by that propenſity to ſleep, muſcular relaxation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, which are their conſtant concomitants.</p>
               <p>But, in order to give a proper idea of theſe diſeaſes, we ſhould conſider the cauſe of the three predominant ſymptoms. If we revert back to what has been ſaid, page 27, on nervous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability, and muſcular irritability, and to the introductory part of nervous affections, we ſhall not be at a loſs to account for two of the ſymptoms.—As for the unnatural propenſity to ſleep, it is ſuppoſed to ariſe from the nerves not being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſupplied with their proper fluid, either from a defect of the general maſs of this enlivening liquid, or from ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the nerves, by which its free diſtribution is imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Hence extreme cold, exceſſive diſcharges of blood—congeſtion, and over diſtenſions of the veſſels of the head, of ſanguinary or ſerous fluid in the ventricles, (27.) and cellular interſtices of the brain—extravaſated blood within the cranium—depreſſion, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now, where this ſymptom predominates over the reſt, thoſe diſeaſes come under the general term COMATA, comatous or ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolent,

                  <p>ſo termed from the Greek <hi>apopleſſo,</hi> deſuper percutio, to be ſtruck down, is a deprivation of all the internal and external ſenſes and animal motion, except of the heart and cheſt, attended with oppreſſed reſpiration, and ſleep more or leſs profound. It has been divided into different ſpecies, from the cauſe—firſt, into ſanguineous—2d, ſerous.</p>
                  <p>DESCRIPTION. <hi>In the firſt</hi> of theſe, the apoplectic ſtroke, at the beginning, is accompanied with a florid, or deep red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the face, heat, and full pulſe; though, in the progreſs of it, the heat and colour recede—and, on theſe accounts, it is underſtood to proceed from an internal cauſe—the veins grow turgid, the eyes half open, but not tranſparent—the reſpiration tolerably free, though attended with ſnoring, or rattling noiſe in the throat—and the pulſe full and ſtrong. It attacks more ſuddenly than the ſerous, without much previous oppreſſion, or unuſual ſleepineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the ſecond,</hi> from the beginning the pulſe is weak, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance pallid—the heat diminiſhed, and it attacks old people, acrimonious, phlegmatic, and debilitated habits—and, before the ſtroke, it is apt to be preceded by an unuſual pain, heavineſs, and giddineſs of the head, and drowſineſs—after the attack, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. have been ſpecified, page, 423. line 3.</p>
                  <p>CURE. Nature has ſometimes, by her own efforts, relieved and remedied this complaint, <hi>but ſeldom,</hi> by producing ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious evacuation, as bleeding from the noſe, looſeneſs, or a large flow of ſaliva, though the cure is generally dependent upon art.</p>
                  <p>Of whatever nature is the diſeaſe, our efforts muſt be exerted with all poſſible expedition, to conquer the obſtruſtions, and take off the congeſtion in the brain, according to the difference of the obſtructing cauſe.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore, if the conſtitution of our patient will bear it, bleed copiouſly, and from large orifices; firſt in the arm; if no relief accrues, then in the foot; and, ſhould the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit be full of blood, the operation muſt be repeated.—The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of cupping-glaſſes, with deep ſcarifications, to the back part of the head is very uſeful, to unload more immediately the veſſels of the brain—or blood may be taken from the jugular vein, running <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the neck into the head—and if the patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers ſo far as to be able to ſwallow, the evacuating plan muſt be perſiſted in—hence quick and powerful purgatives ſhould be adminiſtered, (No. 146.)—but, notwithſtanding the ſanguinary evacuations, ſhould the patient remain in a ſtate of topor, acrid ſtilating glyſters, (No. 103, 114.) ſhould be immediately throws up—and, none of theſe efforts ſucceeding, bliſters ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the legs and thighs—ſome adviſe an actual cautery to the ſoles of the feet, to ſtimulate and rouſe the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>The pulſe in theſe caſes is commonly ſoft, full, and ſlow; but when it is more depreſſed and unequal, and the reſpiration deep and laborious, in proportion to the exceſs of theſe alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, death is nearer at hand.</p>
                  <p>If the diſeaſe be of the <hi>ſerous kind,</hi> with regard to bleedings we muſt act cautiouſly; it is rarely requiſite; if at all—it muſt be moderate; or leeches may be applied to the temples—quick and briſk vomits are in theſe caſes moſt eligible, ſuch as white vitriol, (168.) tartarized antimony, (168.) or antimonial wine, (168.)—after the operation, briſk purges ſhould be given, (17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

applied, and ſtimulating acrid glyſters, (No. 103. 114.)—emetic wine, tobacco ſmoke: and volatiles, ſhould be given pretty freely, (No. 36, 37.) and things ſimilar—and, though in the ſanguineous ſpecies ſternutatories and emetics are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, at leaſt before the fullneſs is abſolutely taken off, for fear of burſting the veſſels of the brain, in this caſe they are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beneficial.</p>
                  <p>Some are of opinion, that the compreſſion productive of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy ſeldom or never deduces its origin from extravaſation of ſerum; and think, that whether blood or ſerum is the caſe, the ſame methods are to be purſued to accompliſh a cure, as bleeding—briſk purging—applying bliſters to the back, legs, and thighs—volatiles and preparations of iron internally, out of the fit—a table ſpoonful of whole muſtard-ſeed, in groſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits taken two or three times a day—muſtard-ſeed or horſe-radiſh infuſed in wine, two ounces to be taken at the ſame peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, I conſider a more eligible medicine after the paroxiſm is over; for it is certainly uſeful to endeavour to recover the tone of the veſſels, which are in theſe caſes apt to be too torpid, and have been debilitated by too great a degree of diſtenſion.</p>
                  <p>One common remedy, which is ſaid to be efficacious in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering patients from the fit, has been adviſed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> a handful of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> diſſolved in a pint of water, and poured down the patient's throat.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to bleeding, ſome prefer opening the temporal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, or jugular vein—and, <hi>when no threatening fullneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;</hi> leeches applied to the head, or ſcarifications with cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſſes to the hind head, are eſteemed preferable to general bleeding.</p>
                  <p>Bliſters all over the feet are recommended by ſome, whilſt others prefer their application to the head—but, in fine, thoſe remedies are moſt to be preferred, and the places of application for external remedies, which moſt ſpeedily promote evacuation and remove the torpor or inactivity of the veſſels.</p>

                  <p>This complaint is of the chronic kind, returns, like an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſy, periodically;—ſometimes it is ſimple—ſometimes combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with other diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, mental affections—cloſe thinking—ſuppreſſion of ſome evacuations—worms—cold—or collection of contaminated ſerum within the ſkull.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>proximate</hi> or <hi>immediate,</hi> an irregular exerciſe of nervous influence, whereby ſome of the nerves continue to act, whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers remain in an inactive ſtate.</p>

                  <p>CURE. During the fit little is to be done, except to rouſe the patient to a ſenſe of feeling, by the application of ſtimulant, volatile, and foetid medicines to the noſe—or ſtrong acid ſpirits—rubbing the neck, ſpine, and back part of the head with rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified oil of amber and ſpirits of wine, camphorated ſolutions, or aether—giving alſo acrid glyſters, (No. 103. 114.)—and if there is reaſon to conclude any fullneſs of the head, leeches may be applied to the temples, or the internal part of the noſtrils may be ſcarified.</p>

                  <p>In general, our plan of cure will conſiſt of the moſt active ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants and ſtrengtheners—emetics and briſk cathartics—with bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and cupping, to which ſhould be had occaſional recourſe.</p>

                  <p>It is ſaid to be an abolition or diminution of motion or ſenſe or both, in one or more parts of the body.</p>
                  <p>When one ſide of the body is affected, it is called HEMIPLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIA, from <hi>emiſus,</hi> dimidium, half, and <hi>pleſſo,</hi> percutio, to ſtrike or affect—when it affects the ſuperior or inferior parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, tranſverſely above or below the diaphragm, (33.)—PARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLEGIA, from <hi>para,</hi> trans, acroſs, and <hi>pleſſo.</hi>

                  <p>Now all theſe depend upon the ſame cauſe, only it operates upon different parts of the nervous ſyſtem—for when one ſide is affected, a compreſſion of one portion of the ſpinal marrow, (27.) called crus, is the ſeat—when the interior parts of the body, or
<pb n="429" facs="unknown:028021_0425_0FD673A2D6329630"/>

                  <p>When <hi>the arms and hands</hi> are affected, the cauſe ſometimes fixes itſelf within the ſuperior vertebrae of the neck and back, or paſſes to the nervous parts of the arms, chiefly the wriſts.</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>local palſy,</hi> the nerves themſelves of the parts which ſupply the proper influence to them, in order to perform their functions, are affected; or, perhaps, in ſlight caſes, it may be owing to a defect of muſcular irritability; for we know, where, from obſtruction, or ſome other cauſe in the vaſcular part of the ſyſtem, by which the parts themſelves will not be properly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with blood, they are defective in, or loſe their motion—beſides, we know great cold will produce ſimilar effects.</p>

                  <p>CURE. Whatever may be the cauſe, our indications are, to endeavour to remove that which proximately, as well as more remotely, contributes to impede the due influence of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous power, by intercepting the influx of the fluid in the nerves, by which it is ſaid that influence is promoted; and attempt ſo to ſtrengthen the affected part, and the whole nervous ſyſtem, by which their ſtrength and activity may be recovered.</p>
                  <p>Now, as the hemiplegia and paraplegia ſeem to be ſo nearly allied to apoplexy, as they are occaſioned by the ſame cauſes, only differently ſituated, that they require ſimilar remedies, we ſhall therefore only mention them in general, and refer for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars to what we have ſaid when ſpeaking on that ſubject—at leaſt for the recent attacks of the palſy—and theſe muſt be regulated by the nature of the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Such as bleeding in full habits—glyſters and purgatives, to continue copious alvine diſcharges for many days, (though in old people this muſt not be done) and bathing the feet in warm water—if accompanied with internal ſpaſms, and there ſhould be great commotions of the blood, diaphoretics of the milder claſs, as antimonials, (180.) joined with abſorbents, (191.) and ſpirit of vitriolic aether, (150.)—ſhould we ſuſpect the blood to be in too viſcid a ſtate in theſe complaints ſucceeding an apoplexy, myrrh, guaiacum, aſa foetida, ammoniacum, (165.) joined with fixed alkalies, (185.) may be adminiſtered, and continued; and alſo chalybeate waters and liniment of ammonia, or ſoap, would at the ſame time, rubbed freely down the ſpine, be of great uſe.</p>
                  <p>In ſerous caſes, and debilitated habits, emetics ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from time to time, in a dilute ſtate, and taken gradually, (No. 11.) or ſtrong infuſion of horſe-radiſh or muſtard-ſeed, till their effects are produced as fully as required—and errhines, (157.) may be applied—ſetons may be cut, and iſſues, as near the ſource from whence the parts are affected as poſſible;—and when the paraplegia ariſes from ſome injury in the vertebrae, and at the part there appears a projection, a cauſtic applied on each ſide of the vertebrae, and an iſſue made by that means, is often a certain remedy.</p>
                  <p>In more obſtinate ſpecies of theſe diſeaſes, in order to make a revulſion, and evacuate gradually thoſe humours from their origin, the ſtimulant aperient pills, (No. 142.) and volatiles u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited

with ſome of the ſtimulant antiſpaſmodics (149.) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, taken in a decoction of the woods, (No. 88.)</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to external applications, in order to promote ſenſation and motion, volatiles—eſſential oils—balſam of Peru—dry frictions with rough cloths, or flannels impregnated with the fumes of ſome of the pungent gums, applied to to the head, parts affected, and the ſpine, will be of uſe.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt capital and efficacious are the Bath waters—or, where they cannot be afforded, warm baths, ſprinkling, whilſt in the bath, upon the part affected, a ſolution of vitriolated iron. (139.)</p>
                  <p>Stimulating the parts with nettles has produced good effects, as well as electricity, particularly in local palſies.</p>
                  <p>The diet of the patients thus affected ſhould be of the warm aromatic kind, taking with their viands freely of muſtard, which alſo may be applied externally, and horſe-radiſh—drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a glaſs of muſtard wine twice a day—or a table-ſpoonful of whole muſtard-ſeed may be adminiſtered in a glaſs of wine—they ſhould uſe briſk exerciſe—ſleep moderately—and live in a warm dry air—cold muſt be avoided—and connubial indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies very rarely gratified.</p>
                  <p>When the palſy is the conſequence of ſome other complaint beſides the apoplexy, whether rheumatiſm, gout, ſcurvy, ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula, colic, or the venereal diſeaſe, the mode of cure will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome variation, adapted to the peculiarity of the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Though theſe complaints frequently terminate fatally in a ſhort time, yet they ſometimes continue for a ſeries of years. When the ſenſe of feeling remains, there is much more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a certain recovery than in caſes where both motion and ſenſation are loſt. A palſy of the lower extremities and abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is for the moſt part fatal, and often attended with a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the diſeaſed parts.</p>
                  <p>Should the part, however, be painful, have perception, retain a degree of warmth, and does not waſte away or a tremor comes on, there may be ſome expectations of a recovery; but more particularly if a ſenſation of creeping or pricking be perceived—ſometimes febrile affections coming on have been the means of curing the complaint—and a looſeneſs has been of evident advantage tending to the ſame end.</p>

            <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. MELANCHOLY, or GLOO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MY MADNESS, is ſaid to be a partial inſanity without indigeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or a difficulty of digeſtion being a concominant ſymptom; for we ſay people are inſane, when the relations of things alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether falſe are conceived in the mind, ſo that either the paſſions or actions of mankind may be exerted irrationally, or not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of reaſon—and it is called partial, becauſe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholic people will do many things, and think on many points, not with proper or well-regulated judgment; yet in ſome they act and think with ſome degree of ſound reaſon.</p>
            <p>MANIA, or FURIOUS MADNESS, is univerſal inſanity, where the whole ideas are ſo generally deranged, that no act, or thought, is conducted within the bounds of cool and deliberate reaſon.</p>
            <p>CURE. All ſpecies and degrees of madneſs which are he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, or which grow up with people from their early youth, are incurable; and ſo, <hi>for the moſt part,</hi> are all mania<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal caſes that are above a year's ſtanding, originate they from whatever ſource they may.</p>
            <p>Very often the remains, or dregs of ſome particular diſeaſe, as intermittents, ſmall-pox, nervous fever, give riſe to different degrees of fooliſhneſs, or madneſs, termed <hi>amentia</hi>—the cure in this caſe muſt be attempted by nouriſhing diet, clear air, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exerciſe, and the uſe of wine; not by evacuations, which in almoſt all other caſes of inſanity are generally thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, unleſs the conſtitution of the patient be ſuch as abſolutely to forbid them.</p>
            <p>And here we muſt enquire what kinds the patient can be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> beſt; and theſe ſhould be proportioned to his ſtrength; elſe from being violent, though they may, perhaps, cure furious madneſs, they will be apt to bring on incurable dejection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> mind, and melancholy.</p>

               </gap>, ſhould the patient's weakneſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the taking away much blood, leeches may be applied to the temples.</p>
            <p>In recent caſes though this is generally attended with moſt ſucceſs; but if of ſome continuance, ſimilar advantages have not been derived from it.</p>
            <p>In melancholy, however, bleeding muſt be ſparingly uſed—in mania more freely—and ſome conſider opening a vein in the arm ſufficient—bleeding the patient in an erect poſture till near fainting—which proves ſome diminution of the fullneſs of the veſſels of the brain taking place.</p>
            <p>Vomiting, in weakly people, with ipecacuanha, (168.)—in the more robuſt, with antimonial wine, or tartarized antimony has been thought preferable, (168.)—in mania it may be a doubtful remedy, by determining too freely to the head, in melancholy it may be more freely uſed.</p>
            <p>Purging is extremely uſeful—the moſt efficacious cathartics have by ſome been thought infuſion of ſenna, (No. 106.) quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with one or two drams of the tincture of jalap, inſtead of tincture of aloes, and ſenna—but the frequent uſe of cooling purges have, from experience been recommended. (No. 147, 148.)</p>
            <p>But ſhould there be an obſtruction of the menſes in women, or the piles in men, a reproduction of theſe evacuations are thought neceſſary—the aloetic purges, (173.) (No. 106. 108.) then will be the moſt proper—and theſe evacuations by vomit and ſtool require to be alternately repeated.</p>
            <p>Diuretics have been conſidered by ſome of the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially if any degree of fever ſhould accompany inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity—but this will happen more in maniacal caſes; for melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholic ſubjects, for the moſt part, make too much water—the moſt proper diuretics are, the vegetable alkali prepared, (191.) and the diuretic ſalt, (176.) and theſe may be given in large doſes alternately, two or three times a day.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, diſcharges by the pores of the ſkin are to be promoted.</p>
            <p>HOFFMAN particularly recommends the warm bath, who has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> numerous inſtances of melancholic and maniacal caſes cured by this means. Dr. CULLEN is of a contrary opinion, and has found it rather hurtful to maniacs—though to rigid melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic habits it may be uſeful, or exhibited in form of a partial half bath, pouring at the ſame time cold water upon the head and ſuperior parts of the body.</p>

From camphor having been ſaid to prove ſucceſsful in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing radical cures, Dr LOCKER gave it in large doſes, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs—though he found camphor diſſolved in vinegar had good effects—he thought then the efficacy might depend upon the vinegar—he gave one ounce and a half of diſtilled vinegar every day, after having firſt prepared the patient by bleeding and purging, which he ſometimes occaſionally repeated—eight by this method, and none of them took more than from ſix weeks to three months, had the cure completed. He recites the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing effects, ſoon after they began the uſe of vinegar—<hi>their eyes loſt their wild ſtaring look, and preſently after became calm and quiet, it acted chiefly by ſweating; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ore they ſweat, the ſooner they were cured—the menſtrual diſcharge</hi> in ſuch as were obſtructed, or had too little of this ſalutary evacuation, <hi>was promoted or increaſed.</hi> From this account, and from the ſimplicity of the medicine, it ought certainly to undergo farther trial.</p>
            <p>Bliſtering the head has been thought uſeful—and, perhaps, it may, ſays Dr. MEAD, in caſes of long ſtanding; but, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, he recommends ſhaving the head after the manner of the ancients, and rubbing it often with warm vinegar; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo paſſing a ſeton in the nape of the neck. Dr. CULLEN is of a contrary opinion, for he ſays, <q>in recent caſes, bliſtering th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>However, ſetons and iſſues I conſider in all caſes of mania extremely ſerviceable, by preventing a fullneſs coming on the habit, from the conſtant drain, and this in an eaſy and gradual manner.</p>
            <p>A frequent uſe of the cold bath in caſes of mania is very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; for CELSUS ſays, nothing is ſo beneficial to the head as cold water. In order, though, to render this remedy the moſt effectual, the maniac ſhould be plunged into the cold bath by ſurpriſe, and detained in it for ſome length of time, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pouring cold water upon the head; ſo, with the aſſiſtance of fear, a cooling effect may be brought on—this has often been uſeful; as has alſo the application of ice, ſnow, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To procure reſt, Dr. MONRO uſed to give two drams of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, camphor, muſk, and other medicines of that claſs, have been preferred to opium, in order to procure ſleep; for in maniacal caſes opium is uſually forbidden—but there are inſtances, where,
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:028021_0433_0FD673AD425E8D58"/>
in large doſes, it has proved a cure—and, perhaps, if it were tried oftener, more powerful effects may be derived from it—and after large evacuations and proper bleeding, and where there was no appearance of inflammatory affections of the brain attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mania, and the patients were reſtleſs, I ſhould not heſitate in having recourſe to it, for two or three times; which, ſhould it be found to exaſperate the diſeaſe, might be eaſily left off—if otherwiſe, the effect would authorize the purſuit.</p>

of the lungs from ſmoke, duſt, or diſagreeable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours—ſtrong paſſion—or other conſiderable emotions of the mind—the relief occaſioned by vomiting or expectoration of mucus freely, and the propenſity to coughing being leſs when the ſtomach is empty—we ſhall not heſitate in concluding the lungs or the windpipe are the parts of the conſtitution affected; and that prediſpoſition in the parts to feel the effects of peculiar infection form the immediate cauſes of the diſeaſe, and alſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe us to ſay,</p>
               <p>That the HOOPING-COUGH is a reiterated and violent concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the pulmonary organs, induced by the convulſive action of the muſcles of ribs, diaphragm, and belly, brought on by the ſtimulus of peculiar infection acting upon the lungs or windpipe, attended with a ſenſe of ſtrangulation, repeated ſono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſpiration, and often with vomiting and expectoration.</p>
               <p>CURE. The indications of which are, to correct or evacuate the peculiar infectious matter—to alleviate and leſſen the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and duration of the cough—and prevent thoſe miſchiefs which are likely to ariſe in the habit, or parts of it, from its exceſs.</p>
               <p>But as we know of no means either to correct or clear the conſtitution of the morbid matter creating the diſeaſe, on theſe we can make no attempt—we muſt therefore imitate nature in her efforts, by ſuch means as experience, founded on the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the laws of the animal oeconomy, will point out to us, in accompliſhing the two ſucceeding indications.</p>
               <p>In full habits, therefore, if the face ſwells much in cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, looks red, and alſo the eyes, and other appearances of local plenitude ſhew themſelves, bleeding is eſſentially uſeful; and this muſt be repeated ſo long as ſuch appearances render it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary—but this muſt not be puſhed too far; for then we ſhould increaſe the convulſive affection—hence, in the ſlighter kinds of the diſeaſe it may be omitted—the body ſhould be kept mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately open, not leſs than two or three ſtools procured every day—violent purging, for the reaſon above recited, might be hurtful.</p>
               <p>Gentle vomiting every day is beneficial in the forenoon, by ſmall doſes of antimonials, one or two ſpoonfuls of the emetic mixture, (No. 11.) for a doſe, or as much as will produce the effect—and ſhould any feveriſh ſymptoms attend, a quarter or half a grain of tartarized antimony may be given at night with the powder, (No. 2.) leſſening or increaſing the doſe according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o the conſtitution; for this mode not only does good by the ſhock it gives to the habit, aſſiſting expectoration, and clearing the ſtomach, but by determining the fluids to the ſurface, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

five muſt be added—by perſiſting in this mode, till evident ſymptoms of amendment preſented themſelves, then omitting the vomit to every ſecond or third day, afterwards giving it once or twice a week, has been crowned with deſired ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding, ſhould ſymptoms appear indicative of an inflammatory tendency on the lungs, which will be ſhewn by difficulty of breathing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Rubbing the pit of the ſtomach, and down the ſpine, with equal parts of rectified oil of amber and ſpirits of wine, where there has been no inflammatory ſymptoms, or febrile tendency; or after theſe had gone off, has been conſidered of great uſe; but bleeding and purgatives, when neceſſary, have preceded their uſe.</p>
               <p>Small doſes of hemlock, (152.) have been given with appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſucceſs; and is by much the beſt amongſt that claſs ſtiled ſpecifics.</p>
               <p>Towards the cloſe, where mucus appears viſcid and difficult to expectorate, the ammoniacal mixture, (No. 141. 143.) is not an unprofitable medicine.</p>
               <p>The ſtimulating tonic mixture, (No. 144.) has been ſpoken of with exaggerated praiſe, but I think too indiſcriminately—early in the diſeaſe I would never recommend it, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in full habits with an inflammatory tendency—though in the latter ſtages, where evacuants have preceded, I have given it with apparent advantage—and, perhaps, in weak, delicate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, it may be exhibited at an earlier period, in ſmall doſes two or three times a day, till a ſlight ſtrangury is excited—the doſe may either be diminiſhed, or given at longer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</p>
               <p>However, in the general mode of management, I ſhould, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>From this account, though conciſe, it appears, that whatever will impede the paſſage of the air into, or the free circulation of blood through the lungs, either by affecting the lungs themſelves, or diminiſhing the capacity of the cheſt, will produce this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint—hence the <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> CAUSES are, thick, denſe, foggy air—or air impregnated with noxious particles or vapours received into the lungs—the aperture of the glottis, (the narrow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. A difficulty of breathing, with ſtraightneſs of the cheſt—ſometimes continual, at others periodic—and ſometimes acute, violent, and not ſubject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
               <p>DISTINCTIONS. Such as are affected with the humid, or moiſt aſthma, are ſeldom free from cough, and, before the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fit, they have ſome ſigns indicating its approach, as languor—loſs of appetite, oppreſſion, a flatulent fullneſs of the ſtomach—after theſe there comes on a violent difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—there is no certainty of the duration of the fit, as it is from a few hours to three, four, or more days—ſtill the ſenſe of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation and difficulty of breathing is ſo diſtreſſing, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients are ſcarce able to lie, ſpeak, or expectorate—yet an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the lungs ſeldom ſucceeds the fit, notwithſtanding there appears ſuch violence affecting that organ—as it terminates, the breathing begins to be more free—mucus is expectorated—the urine changes to a darker colour, and depoſits a copious ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>From the humid aſthma, the dry or convulſive is diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the ſuddenneſs of the attack—a pain and cramp affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome part of the breaſt, particularly if any part of the breaſt has been injured formerly by a wound or blow—from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſymptoms—but the moſt certain ſign is ſaid to be, if a convulſion of any other part be preſent, or has preceded.</p>
               <p>Indeed, both theſe ſpecies may be conſidered, and not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, of the nervous claſs; one having aſſociated with it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>CURE. In full ſtrong habits, in fits of the aſthma, bleeding may be had recourſe to; and, if the conſtitution will bear it, and the continuance of the violence of ſymptoms require it, it may be repeated—but in thoſe which are delicate and debilitated, or far advanced in life, it is more judicious to omit it—as ſoon as poſſible afterwards, the glyſter, (No. 26.) in which from a half to a whole dram of aſafoetida, or more, may be diſſolved, ſhould be adminiſtered—and if theſe do not in a ſhort time prove ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious, a bliſter ſhould be applied between the ſhoulders.</p>

anſwer the purpoſe; but not till expectoration comes on with ſome degree of freedom; for, in the height of the fit, they might produce miſchief, by creating too great an accumulation of blood in the head, and occaſion not only dangerous, but fatal ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms—indeed, if the ſtomach is loaded with any kind of foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vomiting will often prevent the aſthmatic fit.</p>
               <p>A ſtrong infuſion of roaſted coffee has been known to allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the fit.</p>
               <p>In order to promote expectoration, emetics ſhould from time to time be given, and compoſitions formed of the attenuating gums, (No. 141. 143. 145)</p>

               <p>Diuretics are alſo beneficial, particularly in thoſe who have an acrimonious ſtate of fluids.</p>

               <p>Some have been ſaid to die ſuddenly from ſuffocation in this diſeaſe; but this has generally been found to be from polypus in the lungs—partial palſy, or ſome ſpecies of dropſy, has been its termination.</p>

Iſſues in both ſpecies are recommended in the inſide of the thighs juſt above the knee.</p>
               <p>Light diet, eaſily digeſtible, and not flatulent, is the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and riding on horſeback ought not to be diſpenſed with becauſe it is always extremely beneficial.</p>

               <p>We muſt be careful not to confound this with the TRACHAEAL QUINSY, or CROUP, (p. 317, 320,) becauſe ſome authors have given the ſame name to this: notwithſtanding, we ſhall find them widely different, and that they require different modes of cure—<hi>that</hi> being an inflammatory affection of the branches of the windpipe, requires bleeding, which might be highly ſerviceable—<hi>this</hi> being ſpaſmodic, bleeding would be as injurious.</p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. In this complaint there is a peculiar kind of ſhrill croaking, accompanied with a quick and difficult breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, attacking violently and ſuddenly, and generally in the night—from the ſingular noiſe, we may eaſily diſtinguiſh it from inflammatory affections of the lungs, which never attends them, and always makes its approach more gradually.</p>

               <p>CURE. We muſt here endeavour to take off the ſpaſmodic affections as ſoon as poſſible, by bliſtering the back, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious uſe of aſa foetida, giving glyſters of a ſolution of this gum, and pouring the ſame down the throat: and if the fit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, or is conquered by theſe means, bark muſt be given free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to prevent a return.</p>

To a child eighteen months old, ſome have given an ounce of aſa foetida in ſolution, and injected as much by glyſters, in the ſpace of forty eight-hours.—In ſo ſhort a time it will probably be very difficult to get a child ſo young to ſwallow ſo large a quantity.</p>
               <p>However, in ſmaller doſes it has been equally efficacious—alternate doſes of muſk and aſa foetida will anſwer the purpoſe, in conjunction with the glyſter.</p>

               <p>CURE. The indications are, to diſlodge the contaminated ſerum, and throw it out of the conſtitution, by making it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently thin, ſo that it may be abſorbed from the cells where it is lodged—and this we muſt attempt by emetics and ſtimulants; for on theſe we can alone depend for ſaving the life of the patient.</p>
               <p>The antimonial emetics are the moſt proper, (No. 11, 12.) given in ſuch a manner that the ſhock and agitation may be moſt powerful—hence adminiſtered on the ſtomach being empty, or nearly ſo—the arms, back, ſides, and legs ſhould be fomented, and bliſters applied to them—muſtard whey, (No. 127.) decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeneka root, (179.) have been thought uſeful—when the cough has been violent, gentle opiates, joined with aloetics, have been admitted—volatile ſaline mixture, (No. 126) coupled with nauſeating doſes of antimonials, in order to promote expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have been adviſed, and may, perhaps, be uſeful to remove obſtructions formed in the ſmall branches of the blood-veſſels of the lungs, occaſioned by the external preſſure of ſerum collected in the cellular ſubſtance; but they touch not the grand cauſe; for though theſe, or the application of ſome of the attenuating medicines, ſuch as camphor, vinegar of ſquills, gum ammoniac, may cauſe expectoration; in ſpite of all our endeavours, we ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often, indeed, moſt commonly, ſee death uſhered in, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual laborious wheezing—great reſtleſſneſs and anxiety, into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable oppreſſion at the pit of the ſtomach—a conſtant drowſy diſpoſition—coldneſs of the hands and feet, and a livid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of them as well as the face, owing to the blood there ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating.</p>
               <p>In phlegmatic and relaxed habits, iſſues on the inſide of the thigh above the knee may act as a preventive, by hindering a ſerous accumulation taking place in the cellular ſubſtance of the lungs, by affording a continual drain to the conſtitution; but in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, debility in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive organs—a poor and unwholeſome diet—a delicacy, and incitability of the nervous ſyſtem—a defect or excoriation of the mucus which ſhould defend the inner ſurfaces of the heart and arteries, exceſs of paſſion, or ſevere mental affections—ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry free drinking of ſpirituous liquors—unhealthy air—too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

               <p>In children, this diſeaſe very frequently happens, which is owing to another cauſe, as well as ſome of thoſe above ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is too ſoon taking them from the breaſt, and feeding them on ſolid food—in this caſe the legs hang cloſely down—they refuſe to ſtand upon their feet—their ſkin grows ſhrivelled—the whole body, particularly the noſe and nates, become flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid—and, in many inſtances, their appetite is inſatiable.</p>

                  </gap>, reddiſh, ſometimes of a blueiſh caſt, livid, or black—the gums become ſoft and ſpongy; and from them, as well as from other parts of the body, there are effuſions of blood.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> THE SECOND, pains attack the legs, which alſo ſwell, as do the knees, which impede the motion of theſe parts—beſides, pains alſo affect the belly, breaſt, vertebrae, and all the muſcles of the machine—the face begins to look ghaſtly—and ſo great is the languor, when the patients have reſtrained a long time from motion, that, on being ſlightly moved, they are apt to faint; and ſometimes, if expoſed to the open air, they die; now they have often febrile affections of the erratic, continued, or intermittent kind—palpitations of the heart, and difficulty of ſwallowing—their underſtanding and appetite, notwithſtanding their great debility, keep up in a tolerable degree—and they have no pain, except on motion.</p>
               <p>THE THIRD STAGE, the tendons and joints grow ſtiff, they have frequent fainting fits, great dejection of ſpirits—and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fearful, from no apparent cauſe—the cicatrices of old ulcers, if there ſhould be any, again break open—and on the legs, ſoft, livid, and painful ſwelling takes place, and ſpongy ulcers, which bleed—obſtructions, ſcirrhoſities, ulcers, and mortification effect the viſcera—the urine is ſmall in quantity, foetid, high-coloured—difficulty of breathing, ſuddenly deſtructive, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cloſes the ſcene, or they expire in ſome fainting fit.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, living in a moiſt, cold atmoſphere, particularly if in marſhy ſituations—ſuppreſſed or immoderate evacuations—mental affections of the gloomy kind, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="468" facs="unknown:028021_0464_0FD67408E7216520"/>
indulgences of the appetite—groſs viſcid food without any, or with too great a ſcarcity of, freſh vegetables—living upon the coarſe ſalted, ſmoaked, or dried fleſh of quadrupeds or fiſh—few of theſe cauſes ſingly are ſufficient to bring on this diſeaſe; there muſt be a combination—ſailors, from other ſources beſides theſe, are ſubject to the ſcurvy, becauſe they feed on muſty bread, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fiſh, and fleſh, which are corrupted.</p>
               <p>Now theſe cauſes, either by ſuppreſſing the matter of perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which ought to paſs out of the habit, or from their own corrupt nature, induce an alcaleſcent acrimony in the blood, which particular acrimony is the <hi>immediate cauſe</hi> of the ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</p>
               <p>But we muſt here obſerve, that it not only affects people who live in cold, damp ſituations—have little or no vegetable food, wine, or other cordial drink, and are not ſufficiently cloathed—but it ſometimes riſes in dry ſoils and pleaſant ſituations, and attacks people who live in affluence—and hence becomes epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, as was the caſe in the ſpring of the year 1760, in Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; for there it extended its influence in a moſt amazing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner amongſt all claſſes of people.</p>
               <p>From the conſideration of theſe cauſes, it appears probable, and is generally allowed, that the ſcurvy ariſes in the body ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, in conſequence of ſome unknown changes in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, which are more capable of generating ſcorbutic acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, in proportion as there is a defect of ſound vegetable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, fermented liquors, and clean or ſufficient cloathing.</p>
               <p>But though the combination ſeems neceſſary to produce this diſeaſe in the ſoundeſt and ſtrongeſt conſtitutions, ſtill, in ſuch habits as are weak, and naturally relaxed, dull, and ſlothful, or which have been debilitated by any preceding malady, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they live poſſeſſed of generous and proper diet, with warm cloathing, experience convinces us, that from changes of the atmoſphere alone, in them this complaint will make its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
               <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS. Loſs of ſtrength, bleeding of the gums, and different coloured ſpots in the ſkin, for the moſt part livid, particularly at the roots of the hair—occurring in cold climates, moſt frequently, after feeding on putrid or ſalted ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal food, that of the vegetable claſs being at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, particularly freſh vegetables.</p>
               <p>CURE. Dreadful as are the ſymptoms of this complaint, if the texture of the whole ſyſtem of the ſolids is not deſtroyed they all give way to proper treatment. The indications of cure are, to attempt to promote the free excretion of the putrid humours by the inteſtines, kidneys, and ſkin, leſt, by a ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>With reſpect to the uſe of vegetables, we muſt obſerve, that if patients have been deprived of them for a long time, they muſt not be ſuffered to eat of them at firſt voraciouſly, as they are apt to do if left to themſelves, leſt they ſhould fall into a dyſentery—they ſhould begin moderately, and increaſe the quantity by degrees.</p>
               <p>On regularly obſerving what has here been laid down, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the feeding on freſh vegetables, we ſhall have no reaſon to be doubtful of a cure, which uſually firſt ſhews itſelf by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle looſeneſs—and if in a few days the ſkin becomes ſoft and moiſt, it indicates infallibly a quick recovery, eſpecially if the ſtrength returns, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Different other remedies are recommended, ſuch as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of water dock root, with cryſtals of tartar, (No. 159.)—communicating fixable air to the ſtomach, by means of neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing prepared kali in that organ, (No. 160.) WORT, (No. 161.) where freſh vegetables cannot be ſupplied, has been conſidered as more efficacious than the inſpiſſated juice of oranges and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, mineral acids, or four crout, or what is generally taken and applied at ſea for the cure of the ſcurvy, of which from two or three or four pints in a day are to be adminiſtered, if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient can bear it, and the looſeneſs, which it generally occaſions, be not too violent.</p>

               <head>§ 6. CANCER.</head>
               <p>This we may ſometimes trace from the foregoing diſeaſe; for it has been obſerved, that ſome of thoſe who, in the early periods of their lives, have ſhewn appearances of ſcrophula, have in the more advanced ſtages been affected with cancers—hence it is not improbable but that there may be ſome affinity between the humours producing theſe two diſeaſes. It has been called CARSINOMA, from the Greek word <hi>karkinos,</hi> cancer, a crab, from its appearance, the turgid veins running round the margin of the tumors being ſomething ſimilar to crabs claws—and when a hard ſcirrhous tumor begins to be unequal—puts on a livid colour—has acute darting pains ſhooting through it—and at the ſame time veins ſurrounding it being diſtended, and having a ſerpentine appearance, called varicoſe—theſe are ſymptoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as declaratory of a cancer—but, indeed, ſometimes it will ariſe in the lips, gums, tongue, and ſome other parts of the body, without the appearance of ſcirrhus preceding it.</p>
               <p>When this tumor lurks under the ſkin, it is called OCCULT—but when it becomes ulcerated, it then is called OPEN, and is diſtinguiſhed by a very offenſive and foetid diſcharge—the lips of the ulcer inverted—an hardneſs of the ſkin, an exudation of a
<pb n="476" facs="unknown:028021_0472_0FD674134259C2C8"/>
thin, acrimonious fluid—pricking, darting pain, very acute, and obſtinate reſiſtance to every application.</p>
               <p>Like ſcrophulous tumors cancerous ones are lumpy, unequal; but exceed theſe and every other ſpecies of tumor in hardneſs, though, whilſt they remain in an indolent ſtate, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcolouration in the ſkin, they are termed SCIRRHI—when an itching is perceptible, ſucceeded by the darting pain we have before deſcribed, the ſkin turns darkiſh or livid, and the veins under the ſkin put on a varicoſe appearance (475.) in the part affected, they then are conſidered as CANCERS.</p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. A cancer in the beginning is generally ſmall, and increaſes gradually; and notwithſtanding the changes of the colour of the ſkin already mentioned, and that of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing painful from being indolent, it is ſometimes very difficult to determine, when the tranſition from one ſtate to the other takes place, becauſe, according to concurring cauſes, the progreſs becomes quick or ſlow.</p>
               <p>It has, with great judgment, been remarked, that <hi>when pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar kinds of burning ſhooting pains, an alteration of the colour of the ſkin to that of browniſh, purple, or livid,</hi> appear, then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe may be conſidered as a malignant ſcirrhus, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Theſe are deemed characteriſtic ſigns of an occult cancer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally ſituated; but when theſe pains and heat ſucceed in parts where the patient has before been ſenſible of a weight and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, accompanied with a dull pain, we have great reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it lurks internally.</p>

               <p>DESCRIPTION. To this complaint both ſexes are equally liable—and it is generally allowed to manifeſt itſelf in each in the following manner:</p>
               <p>IN THE MEN—ſome days, from four to ſix, ſeldom longer, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reception of the contagious matter, there ariſes not an unpleaſant titillation in the glands of the penis, (55.) in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the urethra, (54.) there appears a little thin liquid—ſoon after which the orifice ſwells, grows red, with a degree of heat, and is more than commonly open—in a ſmall ſpace of time there is a ſenſation in making water, hot and ſcalding, and ſomething like the pricking of needles—a kind of matter, more viſcid than the former, and in larger quantity, makes its appearance, iſſuing from the urethra—that when the diſeaſe is more violent in its attack, through the courſe of the urethra, as far as the neck of the bladder, there is perceived a ſort of tightneſs or fullneſs, attended moſt commonly with erections, more frequent and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than uſual—the inflammation now begins to increaſe, if left to itſelf, every day, conſequently the heat and pain, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge puts on a yellow or greeniſh appearance, ſometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>—ſometimes a ſtrangury, (367.) will come on, and the patient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> night will be tormented with erections, and a bending down wards of the penis, called CHORDEE.</p>
               <p>At length all theſe ſymptoms grow milder as the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abates—the diſcharge becomes white, and more uniform, and at laſt iſſues from the urethra white and viſcid like a find thread, gradually diminiſhing, 'till appearing, now and then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in drops, it totally ceaſes.</p>
               <p>This is the deſcription when it purſues its natural courſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for by the inflammation receding by degrees.</p>
               <p>IN THE WOMEN, it diſcovers itſelf by a ſenſe of itching at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the external orifice of the vagina, (51.) and a more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon moiſture—in a few days the parts begin to inflame, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>With theſe appearances, we ſhould naturally conclude that a patient had received the virus; but this is not always the caſe; for the very ſame may riſe from other cauſes not aſſociated with
<pb n="481" facs="unknown:028021_0477_0FD673DA6D561828"/>
the venereal taint, as very ſevere exerciſe—hard riding, and immoderate drinking—the too copious uſe of very heating ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulants, uſing too cauſtic injection by way of prevention—or, in fine, whatever will bring on an inflammation of thoſe parts. I mention this, becauſe ſometimes, particularly when theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ariſe in married people, it is eſſentially neceſſary to make the proper diſtinction, to ſave the peace of a family—as I have ſeen that peace nearly deſtroyed by the indiſcretion and raſhneſs of a practitioner, pronouncing in a huſband that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge venereal, where the ties of connubial honour had never been infringed, and where the character of the wiſe was, with great juſtice, unſullied. In our opinions, therefore, we ſhould be extremely cautious, and wait for the appearance of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal ſymptom before we pronounce poſitively, particularly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe may be cured in the ſame manner as ſhould be adviſed in caſes of ſimple inflammation without any venereal taint.</p>
               <p>This complaint we conſider as a virulent muco-puriform gleet, ariſing from irritation, produced by venereal virus, after impure concubinage, attended with inflammation of the urethra, a flux from thence of puriform mucus, and a heat or ſcalding in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water.</p>

                  </gap>kened by too ſtrong action and diſtenſion.</p>
               <p>If, therefore, at the onſet of the diſeaſe, the patient is of a plethoric habit, ſtrong ſtamina, poſſeſſed of great vaſcular irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, we muſt have recourſe to bleeding and gentle aperients for two or three days, and plentiful dilution with watery fluids, ſuch as barley-water, linſeed-tea, marſh-mallow-tea, or ſolution of gum arabic in warm water—bathing the penis once or twice a day in warm milk and water, or poppy head decoction—keeping the glans clean, and ſupporting the teſtes by a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</p>
               <p>The opening medicines may be given occaſionally, ſo that two or three ſtools may be procured every day, (No. 23, 24. 66. 97. 99, 135.) any of which, as beſt ſuits the pati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After three or four days, when the diſcharge begin to flow copiouſly, we muſt alleviate the inflammation by the ſedative injection, (No. 164.) which ſhould be thrown gently up the
<pb n="482" facs="unknown:028021_0478_0FD6741AE0480DA8"/>
urethra two or three times a day, and retained for ſome time after each operation—when this has been uſed for four or five days, or ſometimes longer, 'till the painful ſymptoms appear to be yielding, and the diſcharge alters its colour, and grows more viſcid, to this may be added ſix or eight grains of acetated ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſs, and applied in the ſame manner, and in a few days more the cure will be often completed—but the diſcharge in ſome caſes will be of longer duration, from the relaxed ſtate of the veſſels, brought on by the preceding inflammation—when this is the caſe, the diſcharge is much whiter, or clear—the conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence viſcid and ropy, under which circumſtances, we muſt have recourſe to the reſtringent injection, (No. 165.) or that made with calomel, (No. 166.) for this acts as a local ſtimulant, and may therefore be ſerviceable.</p>
               <p>But though this method will generally ſucceed, there is ſometimes one ſymptom extremely troubleſome, and calls for particular attention, ſhould it be violent, which belongs to the firſt ſtage of this complaint, that is, the CHORDEE, ſo called from the Greek word <hi>korde</hi>—this is a contraction of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the penis, which, when it is erected, and only then, is painful, and feels as if pulled down with a chord—this pain is chiefly under the froenum, (a membranous ligament under the penis, which ties the praepuce to the glans,) and along the duct of the urethra, for the alleviation of this ſymptom, low living is particularly neceſſary—gentle exerciſe—avoiding all inebriating liquids—laſcivious converſation, and the company of lewd women—the penis may be bathed often in a day with warm milk and water, or the ſedative fomentation, (No. 11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.) may be uſed, keeping the glans covered with the praepuce du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the operation—and poultices of bread and milk may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the parts.</p>
               <p>Bleeding with leeches upon the part has been highly uſeful—wearing tight drawers, by which means the penis may be confined downwards to the thigh, and erections prevented, which greatly aggravate the painful affection.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it will happen, that, from the violence of the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation, the ſecretion of the mucus ſeems to be totally ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or, at leaſt, conſiderably diminiſhed, ſo that no diſcharge, or only a very trifling one, takes place, though the other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms rage with great violence, under theſe circumſtances we muſt have recourſe to bleeding, emollient applications, fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, (No. 85 or 111.) and poultices, theſe are neceſſary to abate the irritation, and bring on the diſcharge—and here alſo opiates are neceſſary—afterwards we muſt have recourſe to the ſame remedies as we have before ſpecified.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="483" facs="unknown:028021_0479_0FD673DCD3A5F010"/>
Beſides the ſymptoms we have repeated, ſometimes uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the glands of the groins, and ſwelling, called <hi>bubo,</hi> and ſimilar effects in the teſticles, occaſioning pain and tumefactions, will occur; but theſe ariſe from ſympathy, where no abſorption of virus has taken place, and will yield to the ſame modes of treatment as above laid down, conſiſting of the cooling plan and topical ſedatives.</p>
               <p>But when the virus is abſorbed into the habit, it gives riſe to to variety of complaints, which have received various appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from the parts affected, but are all owing to one and the ſame cauſe. The diſeaſe then is conſidered as the POX, or LUES VENEREA, which may be communicated to the habit, wherever the venereal virus gets inſinuated into any part which is wounded or ulcerated, or from ulcers formed by its own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony, or from parts being touched by it where the ſkin is abraded—and the places where the acrimony firſt makes its entrance, are thoſe where the diſeaſe in general firſt makes it appearance—and as coition is the moſt common way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it, ſo the firſt ſymptoms moſt frequently appear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where upon the genitals.</p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. We may juſtly ſuſpect that the virus is diffuſed through the general maſs of lymph, if the local ſymptoms, ſuch as ſhankers, buboes, &amp;c. do not give way to the uſual methods of cure, or, when cured, if they break out again without freſh contagion—but if, at the ſame time, we find ulcers breaking out in the throat, dry ſcabby eruptions on the ſkin, or hard callous tubercles, or puſtules covered with a yellow ſcab, and appearing chiefly on the hairy parts, we may be certain that the caſe is confirmed.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes theſe ſymptoms appear without any diſeaſe of the genitals, and may be produced by other ſpecies of acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony—it may be neceſſary to give what we conſidered their characteriſtic appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venereal eruptions</hi> have a branny appearance, and are ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, unattended with itching, and the ſcales being picked off, the ſkin appears of a reddiſh brown, or rather copper colour underneath.</p>
               <p>The <hi>tubercles</hi> or <hi>puſtules,</hi> ſeldom occupy the cheeks or the noſe, nor have a purulent apex, but are covered at top, either with a dry branny ſcurf, like the eruptions juſt mentioned, or elſe with a hard dry ſcab of a tawny yellow colour; they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly break out amongſt the hair, or near it, on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or temples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venereal ulcers of the mouth</hi> firſt affect the tonſils, avula, and fauces, then ſometimes, though very rarely, the gums—fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently extend to the noſe, and are callous or hard in their
<pb n="484" facs="unknown:028021_0480_0FD6741AE76D2F78"/>
edges—they are circumſcribed, and, for the moſt part, circular, at leaſt they are confined to certain places—are generally hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and moſt commonly covered with a white or yellowiſh ſlough at the bottom—are red in their circumference, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently corrupt the adjacent bones—and are alſo, in general, combined with ſymptoms known to be venereal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With reſpect to pains,</hi> thoſe which are deep ſeated, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the arms, head, and ſhins, always fixed in the ſame place, and which affect the middle and more ſolid part of the bones of the arms and legs, and thoſe of the head, raging chiefly and with great violence in the fore part of the night, may be held as ſure ſigns of this diſeaſe—but other wandering pains of the membranes of the muſcles, and the ligaments of the joints, though they may ariſe from a venereal taint, they cannot be conſidered as certain ſigns without other ſymptoms of the lues are apparent at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Hard indolent ſwellings in different parts of the body, as in thoſe which are fleſhy—in the perioſteum; upon the tendons; upon the ligaments; or upon the bones, or thoſe extuberances at the verge of the anus, called <hi>ſici;</hi> though they are all of them ſigns of a confirmed lues, if they are not preceded or accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by ſome certain ſigns of this diſeaſe that are more certain and evident, we ſhould be very cautious of concluding that they proceeded from venereal virus; for they may depend upon ſome lurking ſcrophulous humour. And here we muſt obſerve, that when they derive their origin from this laſt clauſe, they are very ſeldom painful, or tend to inflame or ſuppurate, whereas thoſe which are venereal uſually do; and, if they lie upon a bone, generally produce a caries—upon the large bone of the leg, fore arm, and thoſe of the ſkull, theſe carious ulcers are moſt commonly met with, and when they are aſſociated with nocturnal pains, we never can heſitate about pronouncing their ſpecific nature</p>
               <p>Frequent abortions, or the excluſion of ſcabby, ulcerated, half-corrupted, and dead foetuſes, happening without any mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cauſe to diſturb the foetus before its time, or to deſtroy it in the womb, may be reckoned as a ſure ſign of one of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents being contaminated.</p>
               <p>The more recent the complaint is the leſs difficult it will be to cure—and the habit of body is a material conſideration; for thoſe whoſe blood is in a mild and bland ſtate ſuffer leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably than thoſe who have their juices acrimonious; for the diſeaſe is remarkably violent, and extremely difficult to cure, in ſcorbutic and ſcrophulous conſtitutions—and in a perſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready inclined to aſthma, pulmonary conſumption, dropſy,

                  </gap>bit is in a ſound and healthful ſtate; for as the original diſeaſe is increaſed by the acceſſion of the venereal virus, of the lues is aggravated by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined to a new diſorder, inſomuch as the conſtitution la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours under complicated miſchiefs.</p>
               <p>The remote ſymptoms ariſe, and the more they affect the bones, ſo much the more difficult the cure; becauſe the venereal virus appears to occupy the minute parts of the habit, and be very univerſally diffuſed through the humours—but the malady becomes incurable if the virus affects the brain, the lungs, the liver, or any of the nobler internal parts, the patients will either ſink under that conſumption called tabes, or die apoplec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>inducing</hi> are, all thoſe applications which inflame or dry up local venereal ulcerations, whether aſtringent given internally, or exhibited externally, or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of buboes without the exhibition of mercury.</p>
               <p>CURE. The indication is, to free the habit from the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real contagion, which may always be done by mercury in ſome ſhape or other, either alone, or combined with ſome other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which the peculiarity of the conſtitution may demand, as in every ſpecies of this complaint, or every complaint ariſing from this ſource, where we are called in before the virus has got firmly rooted in ſome of the more noble organs of vitality.</p>
               <p>Different practitioners have been fond of different prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mercury, and different modes of throwing it into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</p>
               <p>Some adviſe calomel to be rubbed on the inſide of the lips, or cheek, to the quantity of four grains every day, and let it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the habit by the abſorbent ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>Others prefer the mercurial ointme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t, (No. 167.) from half a dram to two drams to be rubbed on the inſide of the thighs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the knee once or twice a day for ſome ſpace of time, 'till all the venereal ſymptoms vaniſh.</p>
               <p>Some have been fond of calcined mercury, (160.) and opium, half a grain of each formed into a pill, and taken night and morning, with a decoction of the woods, (No. 88.) increaſing the doſe to a grain each or more.</p>
               <p>Others have given the preference to the corroſive ſublimate ſolution, (No. 168.) mixed with half a pint of barley water, or decoction of the woods, (No. 88.) to be taken night and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The patients ſhould lie in bed to ſweat after taking the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and they ought to drink plentifully of whey, barley-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                  </gap> ſome ſuch liquid, throughout the day—and if the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine acts not as a gentle aperient, a mild purge may be given occaſionally. It has been obſerved, that thoſe whom it purges two or three times a day get well ſooner than thoſe whom it does not purge—it very ſeldom affects the mouth, but promotes diſcharge by urine and the ſkin. This courſe is to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome weeks after all the ſymptoms diſappear—and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the woods ſhould be taken for ſome time after the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is left off.</p>
               <p>Some prefer the ſublimate pills, (No. 169.) under the idea of their being more eaſily and ſafely taken in greater quantity, and from the ſtomach bearing it better in this way; for the pills, gradually diſſolving, are ſaid not to affect the ſtomach ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly as the ſolution drank.</p>
               <p>However, I think quickſilver mechanically divided into its moſt minute parts, which art is capable of completing, the beſt mode of adminiſtration, as in the mercurial gummous ſolution, (No. 170.) or the mercurial gummous pill, (No. 171.) as the form beſt pleaſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeldom produce ſalivation, if ſome purgative is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited every tenth day, and are ſaid quickly, ſafely, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to take off all the effects of venereal virus, where no chirurgical operation is neceſſary, and then to be highly uſeful in expediting the cure; for by this mode of adminiſtration, a ſufficient quantity of this powerful medicine may be thrown into the habit with the greateſt eaſe, without producing thoſe violent effects the ſaline mercurials are very apt to occaſion—and, perhaps, it is from this power of filling the habit by theſe mild means upon which its ſuperior efficacy depends.</p>
               <p>For children, where mercury is neceſſary to be given, the mercurial ſyrup, (No. 172.) for obvious reaſons, claims the preference.</p>
               <p>Where mercury given in theſe modes ſail, which, under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per management, it rarely does, corroſive ſublimate has been recommended—eſteemed by many the moſt preferable prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in venereal diſeaſes of the ſkin, and thoſe of the bones.</p>
               <p>Some caſes there are, however, which will not yield to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury alone, and ſome where ſucceſs has been derived by vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from time to time the mercurial preparations adminiſtered, and conjoining them frequently with cicuta—adminiſtering ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaparilla decoction, that of mezereon, (No. 173.) or bark with chalybeates, or cooling medicines, opiates, antiſpaſmodics, or cordials, ſuch as the conſtitutional circumſtances required. But here the ſagacity of the practitioner muſt be left to make the neceſſary diſtinction, as it is impoſſible to point out up upon
<pb n="487" facs="unknown:028021_0483_0FD673E647B3C188"/>
paper preciſely the deviations which may occur. We ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve, that where the diſeaſe reſiſts the modes we have laid down, the practitioner muſt labour to find the conſtitutional defect, and combine with mercury other remedies appropriated to its relief.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there are now and then ſome venereal ſymptoms which will remain, notwithſtanding the mercurial courſe being properly perſiſted in, ſuch as nodes, and ſwellings of the perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteum—theſe are ſometimes cured by the mezereon decoction, (No. 173.) or the compound one of ſarſaparilla perſiſted in for a long continuance of time, which will be aided much by the warmth of a ſouthern clime. As for other local affections, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical aſſiſtance is not immediately neceſſary; for healing up of ſhankers, and diſcuſſing buboes by too haſty external applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, has often created miſchief—cleanlineſs and dry lint, in the firſt inſtance, and depending on internal remedies for the cure of both, is by much the ſoundeſt practice, and will almoſt always anſwer, if the complaints are ſimply venereal—if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and they obſtinately reſiſt this mode, the ſkill of a ſurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may become a neceſſary auxiliary.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to a ſalivation, it is ſeldom, if ever at all, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—however, if it is determined on, before the courſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, ſhould the patient be of a full habit, it is adviſeable to take away ſome blood—have recourſe to the warm or vapour lath, two or three times, and clear the ſtomach and bowels with a doſe of gentle phyſic—then let the patient put on a flannel ſhirt—and half a dram of mercurial ointment, (No. 167.) muſt be rubbed in on the inſide of the thighs every evening, gradually increaſing the quantity to two drams, or more, if the conſtitution requires it, 'till a ſpitting is brought on—and this muſt be kept up for a fortnight after every venereal ſymptom has diſappeared—the patient ſhould drink plentifully of ſome diluting liquid, as barley water with gum arabic, marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tea, or ſuch like—and perſiſt in a light, eaſily digeſtible diet—avoid the cool air—and ſpit from a pint to a quart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day—the more gradually the ſalivation is brought on the better.</p>
               <p>If we want to prevent the mercury from laying too ſtrong hold of the mouth, it muſt be diverted to the ſkin, by keeping the patient in a conſtant ſtate of perſpiration, from the warmth of the room, by drinking plentifully of warm, diluting watery liquids—or, ſhould he wiſh to avoid a ſpitting, the patient ſhould take from time to time ſome gentle phyſic, or get into a vapour bath—and this mode is thought by ſome the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable, as by theſe means we ſhall be enabled to throw in a
<pb n="488" facs="unknown:028021_0484_0FD6741F370F8CF0"/>
large quantity of mercury—if inflammatory ſymptoms occur, we muſt have recourſe to bleeding, and confine the patient to a low diet, and copious dilution with watery mucilaginous flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids—but ſhould the ſtrength be much reduced, a nouriſhing diet, with wine, infuſion of bark, and ſome chalybeate prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a free country air, are peoper.</p>
               <p>After the courſe is completed, and the cure performed, the patients ſhould return to their uſual modes of living, as has been repeatedly recommended, when recovering from any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute diſeaſe that has much harraſſed the conſtitution.</p>

            <p>WE now are to treat of diſeaſes of the ſkin—ſome of which are conſidered merely as local complaints of the ſkin it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, beginning in, and not extending themſelves farther than that part of the machine; whilſt others depend on acrid ſtates of the humours, and are more generally diffuſive through the habit, putting on different appearances, according to the parts they affect, and very often alternating with thoſe on the ſkin; ſo that, on the expulſion of the acrimonious humours, they manifeſt themſelves on the exterior ſurface of the machine; and on being expelled, occaſion internal affections.</p>
            <p>We ſhall, therefore, form this claſs of complaints into two diviſions, after particularizing ſome, and from thence deduce our general modes of cure.</p>
            <p>And, firſt, of the</p>

               <head>§ 1. ITCH;</head>
               <p>ſo called from the effect it produces. Different are the cauſes from which this complaint may ariſe, as the ſcurvy, ſo called, lues venerea, &amp;c.—but as theſe eruptions are only ſymptomatic, when thus derived, we ſhall confine ourſelves to the common itch.</p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. This is diſcoverable by ſmall ſpots about the ſize of a millet ſeed, or ſomewhat larger, which, broken by ſcratching, form a ſcab, itch violently—it is contagious, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affects the hands.</p>
               <p>This diſorder chiefly begins between the fingers—red, hot ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles, full of acrid ſerum, make their appearance, to which,
<pb n="489" facs="unknown:028021_0485_0FD673E652AA3E78"/>
by ſcratching, dry, rough ſcabs, attended with great itching, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>But this, according to the ſtate of humours being more or leſs in a bland or acrimonious ſtate, puts on different appearances—hence the ſpots, inſtead of being merely veſicular, will have here and there appearances of matter contained in them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the diſeaſe has been of any continuance, and the patients very dirty—however, we may in general diſcover ſome ſpots manifeſting the true itch, particularly in the places where there is the moſt warmth, as between the fingers, in the bend of the arm, under the arm-pit, in the interior part below the knee.</p>
               <p>Children are more ſubject to it than adults—delicate habits with ſoft ſmooth ſkins, and adults more than old people—all which is owing to the ſoftneſs and moiſture of the ſkin, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſenſibility of that part in one than another.</p>
               <p>The CAUSE is univerſally believed to be, animalculae in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kin—and, from the idea of this complaint ſo founded, a number of the appearances is readily and ſatisfactorily accounted for, as why it is attended with itching, why caught by contagion—and why it returns after ſometimes being cured.</p>
               <p>The itching is occaſioned by theſe animalculae irritating the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                  </gap> then oozes out and forms a ſcab—and theſe animalculae run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under the cuticle, or ſcarf ſkin, (25.) depoſit their eggs in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts; which, by the heat of the machine, are hatched, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sometimes little prominent ſpots, itching and crowding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither excoriated nor ſcabby, will affect the ſkin, from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

But in infants, or the younger claſs of mankind, the ſkin is often eroded with an acrimonious ſerum, and more frequently the hairy ſcalp in the ſkin, which begins at firſt to grow moiſt, with an itching—hence children rub their heads againſt the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or any other thing they lie upon—when this diſeaſe is in its beginning, a rather acid and very nauſeous ſmell may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived—hence ſome have called ſuch eruptions ACORES, from acer, ſharp or four—afterwards the ſkin begins to grow red, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes granulous, then they have named it HERPES, MILIARIS, <hi>miliary tetter,</hi> becauſe the diſeaſe ſpreads and creeps along, and ſpots like millet-ſeed are prominent above the ſkin—others have called it FICOSUS, from ficus, a fig, becauſe in the ſkin the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions look like the ſmall round ſeeds of a fig cut in two—the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Now, the tinea and leproſy we take to depend upon ſome acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious humour diffuſed through the habit, and, by the efforts of nature, depoſited upon the ſkin.</p>
               <p>According, then, to the cauſes and conſtitutional circumſtances do we form our indications of cure; for having not, in the ITCH and TETTER here recited, occaſion to fear any ill conſequences to be derived from repelling any humour into the habit, and the cauſes creating them being merely external, external applications will be ſufficient to form a radical cure, at leaſt very trifling aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance will be requiſite from internal remedies—whilſt in the SCALD HEAD and LEPROSY, ſuch internal remedies are neceſſary as will clear the habit of thoſe acrimonious humours, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting regularly and conſtantly ſome of the natural evacuations, particularly that of perſpiration and urine, and, at the ſame time, ſo ſupporting the ſtrength of the ſyſtem, and eſpecially that of the digeſtive powers, that ſoft, mild, nutritious fluids may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of thoſe which are evacuated, and the diſpoſition which the conſtitution has to generate acrimony ſo offenſive may be altered as much as in the power of medical aid to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh—and indeed the ſame modes will hold good in all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of eruptive complaints, unattended with any fever of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are of long continuance, and come under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of land ſcurvy, &amp;c. and which we have not before ſpecified.</p>
               <p>In order, therefore, to exemplify the different modes, we ſhall proceed to ſpeak of the cure of the four juſt now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and, firſt, of the itch, whoſe</p>
               <p>CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS are, puſtules, or itching ſmall ulcers, contagious, and chiefly affecting the hands, from ſmall animalculae irritating the ſkin below the cuticle.</p>
               <p>CURE. In ſtrong robuſt conſtitutions, it may be adviſeable to take away ſome blood, and give a doſe or two of gentle phyſic—then let the ſkin be well cleaned, by going into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> warm bath, and afterwards have recourſe to ſome of the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, (from No. 174 to 177.)—With regard to ſulphur, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> muſt obſerve, that what is called ſulphur vivum is preferable in theſe caſes as an external application, becauſe, in forming flowers, it loſes much of its efficacy—the flowers are alſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be taken internally, as it is ſuppoſed that ſome of the animalculae might be too deep-ſeated for the ointment to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, hence might they be reached by the ſtreams paſſing through the ſkin—indeed, coupled with a little cream of tartar it makes an agreeable opening and diaphoretic medicine.</p>
               <p>With the mercurial waſh and ointment it will be ſufficient to waſh or anoint the parts affected, or to rub ſome of the latte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

into the palms of the hands or wriſts—and it would be right now and then to take ſome gentle phyſic, and drink copiouſly of ſome aqueous liquid, to prevent the mercury from affecting the mouth.</p>
               <p>If the complaint proves obſtinate, as it will ſometimes do if it is of the dry ſpecies, warm baths may be uſed during the external applications, and ſmall doſes of antimonials, (180) and mercurials, (160.) exhibited with a decoction of the woods, (No. 88, 89.)—but theſe are ſeldom neceſſary, though they are uſeful as auxiliaries, where the acrid ſtate of the humours is a concomitant. Notwithſtanding mercurials have been adviſed, and almoſt always ſucceed in the cure of this complaint, there have been inſtances where it has continued, even after the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent has gone through a ſalivation—under theſe circumſtances, where mercury has not been efficacious, ſulphur is our dernier reſort.</p>
               <p>With regard to the herpes or tetter, it is cured by topical ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and of ſuch kinds as by their ſtimulus and aſtringency give ſtrength and firmneſs to the part affected, ſo that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of perſpiration is made to paſs off freely, and prevented from accumulating on account of the weakneſs and relaxed ſtate of the places wherein the complaint manifeſts itſelf—of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of this ſort there are a great variety, ſuch as ink, water of kali, oil from burnt paper, rags or wood which is acrid; this is to be diluted with faſting ſaliva, and the part affected anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it—but the moſt preferable is a waſh formed of ten grains of muriated quickſilver diſſolved in a pint of water; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the preparations of lead, (139.) have been in the milder kind of this diſeaſe uſeful and efficacious.</p>
               <p>The TIENA, or SCALD HEAD, that ſpecies to which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ourſelves, has for its CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS, ſmall ulcers in the ſkin of the hairy ſcalp, at the roots of the hair, oozing out a humour running into a white, dryiſh ſcab—when this happens to children otherwiſe apparently healthy, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould be kept open with mild aperients, ſuch as magneſia and rhubarb, or Polychreſt ſalt, in properly proportioned doſes; the hair kept cloſe cut and ſhort—the parts clean, by waſhing them with ſoap and water—and a moderate diet preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it is uſually cured by weaning the child, or changing the nurſe, whoſe milk is younger, thinner, and leſs loaded with oily matter.</p>
               <p>Theſe children get the teeth later, and with more difficulty—their bowels are coſtive—and often there appears a propenſity to rickets—without the eruption ſhould be imprudently repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nothing elſe is neceſſary to be done—but if it ſhould be
<pb n="494" facs="unknown:028021_0490_0FD674223A607D10"/>
attended with an acrimony of the humours, and ſpreads itſelf to different parts of the body, a young nurſe ſhould be choſen whoſe milk is bland and well diluted, not rich and thick; ſhe therefore ſhould live on liquid or moiſtening food; at the ſame time, if reſtleſs, gentle opiates may be now and then given to procure ſleep.</p>
               <p>Should this complaint prove obſtinate, and be attended with great itching, a paleneſs of the countenance, and the fleſhy parts appear relaxed and flabby, here we muſt have recourſe to ſmall doſes of calomel, as an alterative, and antimonial wine, with the ſame intent, proportioning the doſes to the ſtate of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and bowels, that the one may not purge, nor the other occaſion too conſtant ſickneſs or nauſea.</p>
               <p>To allay the itching, the head muſt be rubbed with oil of ſweet almonds—ſeveral recommend the pitch ointment of the Edinburgh Diſpenſatory, which I have found effectual—cream mixed with chalk in fine powder—ſolutions of the preparations of lead, and that of muriated quickſilver, as in caſe of tetter, may be had recourſe to.</p>
               <p>In every eruption of tettery kind to which children are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of which the ſcald head we conſider one, Mr. Bell aſſerts, the ſulphur, in ſome form or other, commonly proves the moſt effectual application, therefore, in failure of other remedies, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur ſhould be employed.</p>
               <p>However, of theſe remedies I ſhould recommend a very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious uſe, becauſe I have ſeen great miſchiefs occur from the injudicious application of ſtimulants and repellents in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from the idea of the complaint being merely cuticular, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing nothing from the habit in general—indeed, ſo obvious has it been, that ſoon after the repulſion of the humour, coughs, and febrile ſymptoms have come on—uneaſineſs in the bowels—perceptible emaciation, which, upon the reappearance of the complaint, have all gone off—in a country town, where it was the practice of the old women to cure the ſcald head with pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and butter, it very often proved fatal.</p>
               <p>I ſhould therefore adviſe that cleanlineſs, change of nurſes, or weaning, with the uſe of gentle purgatives, ſhould be firſt tried—if theſe ſucceed not, the uſe of alteratives and antimonials, or the ponderous muriated earth, ſhould be tried for ſome time, and iſſues, before recourſe ſhould be had to any of the preparations of lead, mercury, or ſulphur, then they might be tried with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as I have from experience been convinced—and theſe iſſues ſhould be continued 'till the complaint be totally cured, and the conſtitution has recovered its uſual ſtrength and firmneſs—when this has been repelled, it has been thought adviſeable to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="495" facs="unknown:028021_0491_0FD673E941F41F40"/>
to ſolicit the complaint back again, if any internal ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms manifeſted themſelves, which, it is ſaid, may be done by the application of the leaves of bete to the part originally affected; but of this I have had no experience—it might, however, be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whilſt the other internal remedies above recommended to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off the humour were perſiſted in.</p>
               <p>In the CURE of the LEPROSY, whoſe CHARACTERISTIC SYMPTOMS are, the ſkin rough, with white eſchars, which have a branny appearance, and are chapped—ſometimes moiſt underneath and itching—warm baths, a clear pure air, with a thin laxative diet, are eſſentially neceſſary—and alſo the uſe of antimonials and mercurials—though a ſalivation exaſperates this diſeaſe, ſix grains of calomel, with one of camphor, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited once a week, and purged off with a common purging draught in the morning.</p>
               <p>Dr. RUSSEL aſſerts, he cured the dry leproſy in the courſe of a month, by giving a bolus made of the fleſh of vipers, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grains, and one of camphor, with a little conſerve of roſes, every night, and the morning following half a pint of ſea-water—viper broth, or chicken broth with vipers, has been conſidered as beneficial—but the greateſt ſucceſs has been attributed to the decoction of the interior part of the elm-tree, (No. 178.) which ſhould be continued ſeveral weeks—and ſhould, by its uſe, the effloreſcences be augmented, it is a pleaſing ſymptom, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes a ſalutary termination.</p>
               <p>We have had inſtances of this complaint, where the ſymptoms have put on a high degree of violence, being cured by bark and ſaſſafras, (No. 179.) and the application of a ſtimulant lotion, (No. 180.) night and morning, a perpetual bliſter being at the ſame time kept open between the ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>In complaints of this claſs I have found great benefit from the judicious uſe of mercurials and antimonials, intermediately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the ponderous muriated earth, with the compound de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of ſarſaparilla of the London Diſpenſatory—to a quart of which I have occaſionally added ſix drams of Peruvian bark.</p>
               <p>Indeed, in all eruptive complaints which are united with, and proceed from an acrimony of the fluids internally diffuſed, and manifeſt themſelves by ſymptoms which beſpeak general affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the habit, or internal local ones, I ſhould recommend the gentle evacuating and tonic plain, on the principles we have ſpecified in the former part of this ſection; and ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſpeak of ſome complaints which have been detached from the general arrangement intentionally, and one accidentally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>

               <head>§ 1. INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB.</head>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. This complaint is attended with heat, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſwelling, and pain in the lower part of the belly—vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, the mouth of the womb is ſo painful, that it cannot bear touch, and is drawn inwards—there is a continued fever, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the remittent kind, accompanied with chillneſs, deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, toſſing about of the body—the head, though chiefly the fore part, is painful, and alſo the eyes—convulſions of the neck, hands, and feet come on—the pain extends itſelf to the groins, thighs, midriff, and collar bones, aſſociated with difficulty of breathing and pleuritic ſymptoms;—nauſea, vomiting, hiccough, coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—and pain in making water alſo manifeſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the beginning the pulſe is full and quick, afterwards weak and frequent—to which are joined faintings, coldneſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, drowſineſs, with a number of other dangerous and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. The womb may be affected with this complaint from all thoſe cauſes which are apt to induce inflammatory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in other parts. (See Inflammation, p. 298, &amp;c.)—ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed menſes—or any thing which will determine the blood too freely to the womb, and create an accumulation more than naturally large in that organ. But authors have very judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly divided it into three ſpecies—1ſt, Into that which affects lying-in women—2d, That which is attended with a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever—and, 3d, That which deduces its origin from the milk.</p>
               <p>IN THE FIRST OF THESE, a ſuppreſſion of lochia often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes the complaint, or it is brought on by violent efforts of the accoucheur in difficult labours, blows, compreſſion, laceration from the fingers, or the uſe of inſtruments, retention of coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated blood, and great force exerted in replacing a prolapſus, or falling down of the womb.</p>
               <p>CURE. Now, where only the ſymptoms of common inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation are the concomitants, ſuch as local pain, heat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and the pulſe full, quick, and hard, bleeding muſt be had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to—fomentations and poultices—the patient ſhould drink copiouſly of watery fluids—and take of nitrous, ſaline, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
<pb n="497" facs="unknown:028021_0493_0FD673EAB3C92808"/>
medicines—and, in fine, the method purſued as in other inflammatory caſes. (See Inflammation, &amp;c.) Beſides, here, all external preſſure is to be avoided—if neceſſary, the urine muſt be drawn off by the catheter, and the rectum, (45.) emptied by glyſters occaſionally;—but if the complaint ariſes from a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the lochia, and, notwithſtanding all our efforts, the pain ſhould continue opiates may ſometimes be given with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; for this may proceed from ſome ſpaſmodic affections, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by irritation.</p>
               <p>THE SECOND moſt commonly proceeds from internal cauſes, as putrid acrid matter, or a tranſlation of that which creates ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas to the uterus, diſcoverable by a burning heat internally—delirium, black dry tongue, and at the ſame time coldneſs of the extremities, with a frequent and irregular pulſe.</p>
               <p>CURE. Here are required a freer uſe of opiates and diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, to determine the fluids to the ſkin, and evacuate the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending matter, becauſe theſe caſes ſeem more to depend upon irritating cauſes than mere inflammations—the patients, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhould be kept much in bed, moderately warm—drink free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of barley water, thin gruel, and theſe frequently repeated—go occaſionally into the warm baths—and gentle diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, (180.) ſhould be inſiſted upon, as antimonials in ſmall doſes, acetated ammonia, (180, 181.) nitre, (176.) and ſuch like.</p>

               <p>CURE. Here we ſhould purſue the mode ſimilar to what we have laid down its inteſtinal inflammation—large evacuations, by bleeding, purging, with diuretics, and a thin ſpare regimen—the milk alſo ſhould be ſolicited into the breaſts by every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means, ſetting the child early to the breaſts, applying cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping glaſſes, ſaline mixtures, and antimonial preparations, given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>With reſpect to bleeding, ſome have thought it unneceſſary, becauſe of the diſcharge of the lochia; but in this caſe a larger quantity by much than what flows in that caſe is neceſſary to be taken, that death may be avoided, and the depoſition of milk in the abdomen, or a milk abſceſs, may be prevented;—for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe has been ſaid to be fatal to many women—and in opening <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But if the fever ſhould be moderate, the lochia, ſweats, and flow of milk into the breaſts proper and natural—there ſhould be no ſwelling of the abdomen—no head-ach, particularly if there ſhould be a looſeneſs and bilious ſtools, it will be ſufficient to ſupport theſe evacuations by drinking copiouſly mild thin gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Now, from the accounts given of theſe three ſpecies, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of cure are plainly pointed out to us. IN THE FIRST, we endeavour to take off the inflammation by the common mode directed for ſubduing inflammatory complaints of other parts. IN THE SECOND, we attempt to evacuate the acrimony. And IN THE LAST, to prevent the coagulation of the milk, or its effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into parts for which it is not deſtined by nature, by ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into and keeping it in its natural reſervoirs.</p>

               <p>ſo called from the Greek <hi>leukos,</hi> albos, white, and <hi>reo,</hi> fluo, to flow, becauſe of the diſcharge being generally of a white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour—alſo FLUOR ALBUS, white flux—it is vulgarly called the WHITES, for the ſame reaſon—this is a diſcharge of ſerous or mucous matter, ſometimes white, or others yellowiſh, brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, or rather greeniſh, from the womb and vagina.</p>
               <p>DESCRIPTION. At firſt this diſcharge is mild and ſerous, which afterwards, by not paſſing freely off, or ſtagnating, becomes more thick and acrimonious, and will be different with regard to its colour and ſmell—indeed, thoſe ſymptoms which we have enumerated as concomitants to a morbid flux of the menſes from a paſſive cauſe, generally here attend—and when the diſcharge is exceſſive, or of any long continuance, pains and weakneſs of the loins—indigeſtion—and other ſymptoms of debility—ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the eye-lids—thick urine—palpitation of the heart—frequent faintings, are almoſt always conſtant concomitants;—but in the early ſtages they do not frequently make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to any great degree.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the colour and conſiſtence of the diſcharge alter, from a variety of circumſtances, according to the nature and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſeaſe, ſeaſon, climate, and conſtitution—in warm weather, groſs habits neglecting to keep the parts clean, from quantity or acrimony painful excoriations are occaſioned, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that ſometimes it has been difficult to diſtinguiſh it from the effect of ſome venereal taint—and here it will be neceſſary to advert to ſome concomitant circumſtances—if a diſcharge comes on ſuddenly, with ſymptoms of heat and pain—if it is not attended with weakneſs or pain in the back—if the patient appears to be of a healthful ſtrong ſtamina—has had no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren—no miſcarriages—nor ſevere or copious flow of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes—if the diſcharge ſhould be thin and much diſcoloured at firſt, we may then ſuſpect ſomething of venereal affection in the caſe—indeed, I have known many cured of what they called the whites by means to which a virulent gleet, or clap, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> readily yield.</p>
               <p>However, the WHITES often occur in women who are ſubject to too copious a flow of the menſes, or have them too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return, and are liable to this from cauſes which weaken the veſſels of the womb and vagina—or are of a relaxed or debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated conſtitution—hence it generally affects women advanced in life, particularly thoſe who have had children, have often miſcarried, menſtruated irregularly—alſo thoſe who lead an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active life; thoſe who are full and jolly, and whole ſolids are
<pb n="501" facs="unknown:028021_0497_0FD673F2390DCA08"/>
looſe and flabby—the more recent and whiter the diſcharge, the more eaſy to cure the diſeaſe; the longer the continuance, and the more green or brown the colour, the more difficult.</p>
               <p>CAUSES. Are all ſuch as occaſion a collection of ſerum, and weaken the veſſels of the parts affected, or the habit in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral—hence living in moiſt air—feeding on viſcid too food, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a life of indolence—uſing too frequently warm baths; an immoderate flow, or an obſtruction of the menſes; or it may be occaſioned by a tranſlation of humours to the womb and vagina.</p>
               <p>CURE. Now it will appear obvious, as we conſider the nature of the diſeaſe, whether <hi>local</hi> or <hi>general,</hi> ſo muſt we adapt our remedies, whether it depends upon the relaxed ſtate of the veſſels of the womb primarily and principally, or we attribute it to the debilitated ſtate of the ſyſtem; in the former, we may place much dependance upon external applications of the aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent claſs; in the latter, ſome medicines internally ſhould be exhibited, which will not only give ſtrength to the conſtitution, but contribute to maintain it in that ſtate—hence, then, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different circumſtances of the conſtitution, we muſt regulate our modes of cure.</p>
               <p>When it occurs in thoſe who live ſedentary and indolent lives, indulging in luxuries, and ſupporting themſelves by a full rich diet, by which the habit will be loaded with groſs humours, their mode ſhould be altered to a diet which is more ſparing, and a cooling regimen, having frequent recourſe to purgatives, and a more active ſtate of life; but to thoſe of a more weak, relaxed ſtate of ſolids, we muſt invigorate the conſtitution in the ſame manner as directed in too copious flow of the menſes from a paſſive cauſe, (500.)—here it is of great uſe to keep the parts clean by frequent partial baths of cold water; and after gentle evacuations, in thoſe who have lived indolently and luxuriouſly, an aſtringent waſh of the gentle kind may be made uſe of, ſuch as the reſtringent injection, (No. 165.) with the addition of eleven ounces of infuſion of roſes; in thoſe of relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed habits, injections of bark with alum, alum water, infuſion of tormentil roots, with litharge water, or ſome ſuch aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent preparations; for they are ſaid to diminiſh the diſcharge, and, in recent caſes, entirely remove it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes from a long continuance of this diſeaſe, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are apt to be acrimonious and irritating, and aſſiſt in ſupporting the diſcharge; then hartſhorn jellies, or thoſe of iſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, are agreeable and uſeful auxiliaries.</p>
               <p>Sometimes thoſe ſtimulants which act upon the urinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and communicate their effects to the womb and vagina.
<pb n="502" facs="unknown:028021_0498_0FD67461EFDF37F0"/>
have been thought beneficial in theſe caſes; Spaniſh flies in tincture, joined with ſome of the preparation of iron, and bark, have produced good effects; balſam of copaiva; balſam of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, and thoſe of this claſs, have been conſidered as uſeful.</p>
               <p>But, in caſes of long ſtanding, I have ſeen much benefit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, during the uſe of aſtringent medicines, from a ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plaiſter or bliſter applied to the region of the ſacrum, or lower vertebrae of the back.</p>
