            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE it has pleaſed God to give me a true Knowledge of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Grace, I have frequently thought, that next to the Falling away of the Clergy from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Reformation, the Books which are in our Church, founded on the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme, have been the chief Cauſe that ſo many of our own Communion in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, have built their Hopes of Salvation on a falſe Bottom. The Authors not only led the People Captive in their own Life-time, but alſo after their Death, like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> for a long Seaſon have bewitched the People with their Sorceries, I mean their ſeemingly devout, but at the Bottom, Anti-Chriſtian Compoſitions. — The only Way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to open People's Eyes, I think is this, to ſhew them, that the Writings, which for ſome Years paſt have been ſo much admired, are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; for this Reaſon
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004643_0003_100ECA0F2B9B96E8"/>
I thought it my Duty to bear a publick Teſtimony againſt the Writings of Archbiſhop Tillotſon: — And upon the ſame Account, think it my Duty, to point out the fundamental Error of an Author, as much admired and read by the more common, as the Archbiſhop by the more learned and polite Sort of People.</p>
            <p>I know you are impatient to hear who this can be: If you will promiſe me not to be angry, I'll tell you. — It is that much admired Book called <hi>The whole Duty of Man.</hi> — Methinks I ſee you ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the very mentioning of it; but remember, I deſired you not to be angry. — And if you will throw aſide Prejudice, and are ſincerely deſirous to know and do the divine Will, I am perſwaded we ſhall both be of one Mind concerning this Book, e'er you lay this Letter down out of your Hand.</p>
            <p>But, before I ſhew you its Error, to convince you of my Impartiality, I confeſs that the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Book were once of Service to me. — And I believe have been uſeful to many others. — The Book in general is calculated to civilize, but I am perſwaded, it never was a Means of Converting a ſingle Soul. — I have juſt been looking over the Index and General Titles at the End of it, and cannot find the Word Regeneration ſo much as once mentioned. — And indeed, the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe is built on ſuch a falſe Foundation, as not only proves the Author to be no real Chriſtian at Heart, but alſo, that he had not ſo much as a Head Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. To prove this, I need only refer you to Part of the Preface.— <hi>Of the Neceſſity of Caring for the Soul</hi> (Paragraph 17) wherein the Author, talking of the ſecond Covenant, ſpeaks thus. —
<q>This ſecond Covenant, <hi>ſays he,</hi> was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and us in him, preſently after his Fall, and is briefly contain'd
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004643_0004_100ECA0335F76E00"/>
in theſe Words, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15. where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Head; And this was made up, as the firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by us.</q>
Who, that is any way enlightened, cannot but ſee the falſe Divinity and fundamental Errors of this Paſſage? For, how can it be proved, that the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> or that God ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into any Covenant at all with Man, after he had broken the Firſt? It is true, God the Father, did enter into a Covenant (and that from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) with the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the God-Man, Chriſt Jeſus, in our ſtead. — But it cannot be proved, that he made any Second Covenant at all with <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf or any of his Poſterity.— But ſays our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<q>He did make a ſecond Covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and us in him, preſently after his Fall, and it is briefly contained in theſe Words, where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head.</q>
— But I would aſk where any Covenant is contained in theſe Words, and how it is
<q>made up, as the firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome Duties to be perform'd by us?</q>
Here is a free Gift and Promiſe of Salvation made to <hi>Adam,</hi> but no Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Here is not a Word of any Condition men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. — No, it was the Free Gift of God in Chriſt.— <hi>Adam</hi> was now in a State of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He was ſo far from being deſirous of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Covenant with, that he fled from God, and was not ſo much as truly convicted of his Sin, as will evidently appear from the Context.— For both he and his Wife laid the Fault, not upon themſelves, but on one another, and on the Serpent. <hi>The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which thou gaveſt me</hi> (therein tacitly reflecting upon God for giving him that Woman) <hi>ſhe gave
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004643_0005_100ECA128EA4D338"/>
me,</hi> ſays <hi>Adam, and I did eat. The Serpent beguiled me,</hi> ſays the Woman, <hi>and I did eat.</hi> — Here appears no true Senſe of Sin at all. — And to ſhew they had no Notion of a Saviour, we are told, <hi>they ſewed Fig Leaves together,</hi> inſtead of applying to God, <hi>to cover their Nakedneſs,</hi>and afterwards <hi>fled from God, when they heard the Voice of the Lord God walking among the Trees of the Garden.</hi> — Here then opens that Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the Fleſh. Notwithſtanding our firſt Parents had broken the Covenant and had their Hearts hardened, yet out of the Riches of his Free Grace, God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Remedy from all Eternity, and now reveals it in Time. — <hi>The Seed of the Woman, i. e.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt (who in all probability was ſpiritually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Inſtant in the Heart of <hi>Eve</hi>) <hi>ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head, i.e.</hi> by his Obedience and Death, ſhall ſatisfy divine Juſtice, fulfil the moral Law in Man's Stead, and thereby deliver him from the Power of the Devil.— Here are no Terms menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned on Man's Part at all: And ſuppoſing there had been a Covenant made with Man,
<q>and it had been made up, as the Firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by us,</q>
Alas, we are of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the moſt miſerable; for then we are not under Grace but under the Law. — And if <hi>Adam</hi> could not keep the firſt Covenant, tho' in perfect Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, how can we, who hate God by Nature, and whoſe Thoughts are only Evil continually, keep a Second, like unto it? Is not this putting Man into a moſt unhappy Condition, and making his poor imperfect Obedience the Cauſe, why Jeſus Chriſt is merciful unto him? And if ſo, how is Boaſting excluded in the great Work of our Redemption, as the Scriptures every where affirm? And how can Eternal Life be the Free Gift of God thro' Jeſus
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004643_0006_100ECA1507E98728"/>
Chriſt our Lord? But this is agreeable enough to the Divinity of this Author, who in the 21ſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of this Preface, ſays, —
<q>The third Thing Chriſt was to do for us, was to enable us, or give us Strength, to do what he requires of us. This he doth, Firſt, by taking off from the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to commit the leaſt Sin, upon Pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and requiring of us only an holy and hearty Endeavour to do what we are able, and where we fail, accepting of ſincere Repentance.</q>
Now I would fain know, where God has taken off from the Hardneſs of the Law given unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and required of us only an holy and hearty Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do what we are able, and where we fail, accepting of a ſincere Repentance? This is all as falſe, as God is true. The whole Law is as much in force againſt us, as it was againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> before we believed in Chriſt. God has been ſo far from taking off from the Hardneſs of the Law, given to <hi>Adam,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt declares, <hi>That he came not to deſtroy, but to fulfil it.</hi> And until convinced of the Obligation we lie under, to obey the whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, in Thought, Word, and Deed, how can we ſee the Neceſſity of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.—God's Law was honourable. Jeſus Chriſt fulfilled it in our Stead; and upon Account of that Righteouſneſs, imputed to us, and received by Faith, and not on our hearty Endeavour or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are we accepted by him. What is there, in our hearty Endeavour or Repentance, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to the Favour of God, or to render them worthy of being joined with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? as tho' that was not ſufficient of itſelf. — Our beſt Actions are but <hi>ſplendida peccata,</hi> Glittering Sins. —
<q>I cannot pray, <hi>ſays the pious Biſhop</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veridge, but I ſin; I cannot hear, or preach a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004643_0007_100ECA16E0D6F798"/>
Sermon, but I ſin; I cannot give an Alms, or receive the Sacrament, but I ſin; nay, I cannot confeſs my Sins, but my very Confeſſions are ſtill Aggravations of them; my Repentings need to be repented of, my Tears want waſhing, and the very Waſhing of my Tears needs ſtill to be waſhed over again, with the Blood of my Redeemer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord, is our whole Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We are to go to him as poor Sinners;—beg Salvation of him, as his Free Gift, and intreat him to give us a Living Faith, whereby that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be applyed to our Hearts; and then that Faith, if true, will work by Love. But before this Faith, we cannot be ſaid to have an actual Intereſt in the Benefits of Chriſt's Purchaſe. This the Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> was wholly ignorant of, otherwiſe he would not have laid ſuch a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if the Foundation be ſo bad, judge you then, how wretchedly weak the Superſtructure muſt be. It would take up more Time than I can at preſent ſpare, to point out all the Miſtakes of the whole Book. — I will only refer you to what this Author ſays about Recreations, <hi>Sunday 9th. Sect.</hi> 7. wherein he ſeems not only to allow of Gaming, by ſaying, <hi>If we play at any Game,</hi> but directs us when we do, <hi>to let the End of our Doing it, be meerly to recreate our ſelves.</hi> — I thought the Glory of God, and not ſelf-pleaſing, had been the Scope to which all Chriſtians ought to be directed. I ſuppoſe, from this Paſſage, a Man, whom I reproved lately on the Road, for Gaming in the Chriſtmas Holy Days, grounded his Authority for ſo doing.—He told me, <hi>The whole Duty of Man</hi> ſaid he might do ſo.—And, indeed, I believe he is not the Firſt, by Thouſands, who has been miſerably deceived by this much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Book: And therefore, I thought myſelf

obliged to write this Letter; you may make what Uſe you will of it. I care not if the Contents are publiſhed upon the Houſe Top: Nay, I think it your Duty, if convinced yourſelf, to endeavour to convince others: For there's no Hopes of bringing People to a right Knowledge of the Goſpel, till their favourite, tho' erroneous, Authors, are diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and laid aſide. — Before I ſee <hi>England,</hi> I hope I ſhall hear, that my Dear Friends in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, both in Preaching and Printing, have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded my Teſtimony.—Future Ages, as well as the preſent, will be much beholden to them for it. —Their Declarations will ſtand as Records, that God did not leave himſelf without Witneſs, even in the worſt of Times: Other Goſpel Miniſters will be encouraged thereby, and Thouſands, nay, Ten Thouſands preſerved from Infection, which otherwiſe perhaps, they may not be able to avoid: —However, whether they ſecond me or not, by the Help of my God, both abroad and at home (if it be the divine Will I ſhould ſee <hi>England</hi> again) I will perſevere in bearing a more explicite and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Teſtimony, againſt the falſe Writings of our admired Rabbies. Do you and my other Friends watch over me. Reprove me ſharply, whenever you perceive my Spirit any way imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—Pray that I may be as meek as a Lamb, but as bold as a Lion; and then, whatever befalls me, for ſpeaking as I ought to ſpeak, thro' divine Grace, will be cheerfully ſubmitted to, by</p>
