            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>IN the American Daily Advertiſer, and other public papers, are inſerted Debates of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States, on the 28th of November laſt, ſome ſpeeches or animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of two or three of the ſouthern delegates, on the preſentation of what is there ſtiled "a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per purporting to be a memorial reſpecting the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of ſlavery, which in the opinion of the ſaid delegates, and divers others, was declared to be an application unconſtitutional, and of miſchievous conſequences, as it would only tend to render the Negroes unhappy, and excite them to inſurrections in thoſe ſtates where they were moſt neceſſary to be retained; and that even the publication of a <hi>fanatical memorial</hi> in the newſ-papers, might have a fatal effect in diſturbing the preſent excellent har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the union; for the people of the ſouthern ſtates may be led thereby to ſuppoſe, that this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial is before Congreſs, and will be diſcuſſed dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent ſeſſion, it is therefore the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025821_0003_0FCEF044E2C20E58"/>
to undeceive them, by publiſhing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and by expunging the entry from the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals."</p>
                  <p>Having believed it my religious duty to addreſs that memorial to Congreſs, and that in ſo doing, I was really influenced by the Catholic principle of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good-will to men, and ſincerely deſirous of promoting that <hi>excellent harmony and union,</hi> which is founded on the ſolid baſis of impartial liberty and common right, I may acknowledge it is far from being a matter of indifference to me to find, in the above-cited publication, ſo little regard paid to this great fundamental of the public weal; by men choſen and entruſted to fill a ſtation ſo very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, who ought and may be ſuppoſed, on a ſubject of ſo intereſting and extenſive concernment, to ſpeak their real ſentiments, unbiaſſed by any ſiniſter purpoſe; I have been therefore led I truſt, by the ſame diſintereſted and Chriſtian motive, which induced me to make the application in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to enter into a cloſe ſelf-examination and reconſideration of the tenor of my ſaid memorial, left through an unguarded warmth of zeal, I might have given occaſion to thoſe not well-affected to that divine precept and perfect rule of univerſal equity, enjoined by the higheſt authority, <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo unto them</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. vii.31.</note>—to ſtamp the righteous and liberal aim and deſign of my memorial, with the oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious ſtigma of <hi>fanaticiſm</hi>; and as far as I have
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025821_0004_0FCEF056F4099C08"/>
been capable of an impartial ſcrutiny, I do not find any thing therein contained more juſtly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting ſo invidious a cenſure, than what may be found in divers publicacions of Congreſs on the ſame ſubject; ſome of which I have thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſelect and bring into view, beginning with the following remarkable language of the aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on entered into the 20th of October, 1774.</p>
                  <p>"And therefore we do for ourſelves and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſeveral colonies whom we repreſent, firmly agree and aſſociate under the ſacred tics of virtue, honor, and love of our country, as follows:</p>

"We will neither import nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe any ſlaves imported after the firſt day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember next, after which time we will wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the Slave Trade, and will neither be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it ourſelves, nor will we hire our veſſels, nor fell our commodities or manufactures to thoſe who are concerned in it<note n="*" place="bottom">Did not Virginia and Maryland conſider this to be perpetual, by their Aſſemblies paſſing laws accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly?</note>.</p>
                  <p>8th Article. "And will diſcountenance and diſcourage every ſpecies of extravagance and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially all horſe racing, and all kinds of gaming, cock-fighting, exhibitions of ſhews, plays, and other expenſive diverſions and entertainments."</p>
                  <p>To the Inhabitants of the Colonies.</p>

God, the Creator of all, requires, that a true and impartial judgment be formed of the meaſures leading to ſuch oppoſition; and of the cauſes by which it has been provoked, or can in any degree be juſtified, that neither affection on the one hand, nor reſentment on the other, being permitted to give a wrong bias to reaſon, it may be enabled to take a diſpaſſionate view of all circumſtances, and to ſettle the public conduct on the ſolid foundations of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſtice. From counſels thus tempered ariſe the pureſt hopes of the divine favor, the firmeſt encouragement to the parties engaged, and the ſtrongeſt recommendations of their cauſe to the reſt of mankind, &amp;c."</p>

                  <p>"If it were poſſible for men who exerciſe their reaſon to believe, that the Divine Author of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence intended a part of the human race to hold an abſolute property in, and unbounded power over others, marked out by infinite goodneſs and wiſdom as the objects of a legal domination, never rightfully reſiſtable, however ſevere and oppreſſive the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of theſe colonies might at leaſt require from the Parliament of Great Britain, ſome evidence that

                  <p>And in the Declaration of Independence is inſerted reſpecting the King as follows:</p>
                  <p>"He has plundered our ſeas, ravaged our coaſts, burnt our towns, and deſtroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time tranſporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works

of death, deſolation and tyranny, already begun with circumſtances of cruelty and perfidy ſearcely paralleled in the moſt barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation. He has excited domeſtic inſurrections amongſt us."</p>
                  <p>And here I think it may be proper to mention, that under permiſſion of Divine Providence, the meaſure which both Britains and Americans had long dealt to the natives of Africa, they were in like manner ſuffered reciprocally to mete out to each other, by burning towns, &amp;c. captivating their inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, ſtowing them into gaols and priſon ſhips, to linger under agonizing pains unto cruel death; at this ſtage of affairs Congreſs reſolve at different times on public faſting and prayers, wherein they acknowledge the ſuperintendence of an all wiſe Providence, and the obligations our nation was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reform from its ſins and implore his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful interpoſition, to remove thoſe calamities from the land, and avert thoſe deſolating judgments with which we were threatened. See Journal June 12, 1775, and March 16, 1776.</p>
                  <p>In a pamphlet, intitled, "Obſervations on the American Revolution," publiſhed by order of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in 1779, the following ſentiments are declared to the world, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great principle (of government) is and ever will remain in force, <hi>that men are by nature free:</hi> as accountable to him that made them, they muſt be ſo; and ſo long as we have any idea of Divine Juſtice, we muſt aſſociate that of human freedom. Whether men can part with their liberty, is among
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025821_0008_0FCF278A80D47E70"/>
the queſtions which have exerciſed the ableſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but it is concluded on all hands, that the right to be free can never be alienated—ſtill leſs is it practicable for one generation to mortgage the privileges of another."</p>
                  <p>After the laborious productions of the wiſdom of this country, manifeſted to the world by the declarations and addreſſes from which the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are extracted, with others of a ſimilar nature, demonſtrating the natural rights of men in ſo clear a manner, the following appears to have been adopted as the then faith of the nation, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of independence the 4th of July 1776, viz. "We hold theſe truths to be ſelf evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that amongſt theſe are life, liberty, and the purſuit of happineſs."</p>
                  <p>At the time of entering into the ſolemn league and covenant (20th October 1774) to vindicate the rights of man, and promote national righteouſneſs, had any one declared as their opinion that it was of miſchievous conſequence, tending to render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy the helpleſs victims of deſpotic tyranny, and excite to inſurrection, or attempted to enforce as a political creed, ſo deteſtable a poſition, as that a happy <hi>national harmony and union</hi> depended on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to one claſs of men, the power and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of enſlaving and exerciſing an imperious lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over another part of God's rational creation, ſuch perſon, though he might not have been ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized

as a fanatic—would doubtleſs have been in danger of being proſcribed as an enemy to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and a traitor to the common cauſe of equal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: now feeling ſuch a weight on my ſpirit, I am thereby impelled, by a ſenſe of duty to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of the Univerſe, and the dictates of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to open my mouth for the dumb, in the cauſe of ſuch as are appointed to deſtruction; and if this is fanaticiſm, enthuſiaſm, &amp;c. may the Almighty grant a double portion to what I ever experienced, if it be his holy will! I cannot uſe the carnal ſword in my country's defence, I believe that weapon for a Chriſtian to be unlawful, yet I truſt I ſhall with the weapons that are to me lawful in the cauſe of my country, manifeſt as much firmneſs and ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, though it be but in the exerciſe of one talent, as thoſe who think themſelves juſtified in the uſe of other and greater talents: and therefore, as I do indeed feel alarmed, when I conſider that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn profeſſions ſo lately made in time of extremity and danger, and held up as the national faith, ſhould ſo ſoon on this important occaſion ſeem to be regarded as mere <hi>tricks of ſtate,</hi> what can be thought will be the iſſue? may it not be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like trifling with omnipotence?</p>
                  <p>I crave your patience, my fellow citizens—I am intereſted in the welfare of this country; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have any conception that this nation will long fare well, when after ſuch declamations againſt Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on account of the deſpotic meaſures purſued by her adminiſtration, the ſpirit of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is ſuffered ſo readily to prevail in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils

of American rulers, to a degree in no inſtance exceeded by Britain; on which head I venture to appeal to the witneſs for God in your own breaſts, which will undoubtedly ſhew the national iniquity is the ſame, whether it proceed from Acts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or receive its ſtrength from the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>Had Congreſs done as much towards removing this national guilt, as by the tenor of their own vote they have power to do, there is no doubt with me, but that it would at leaſt have given a very powerful check, if not a total ſtop to the odious traffic, notwithſtanding the plea of reſtriction in the conſtitution of the general government: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will hear or forbear, I think it my duty to tell you plainly, that I believe the blood of the ſlain, and the oppreſſion exerciſed in Africa, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by Americans, and in this country alſo, will ſtick to the ſkirts of every individual of your body, who exerciſe the powers of Legiſlation, and do not exert their talents to clear themſelves of this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when they ſhall be arraigned before the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous bar of the judgment-ſeat of him who will not fail to do right, in rendering unto every man his due; even him who early declared, "at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man;" before whom the natural black ſkin of the body will never occaſion ſuch degradation. I deſire to approach you with proper and due reſpect, in the temper of a Chriſtian, and the firmneſs of a veteran American Freeman, to plead the cauſe of injured innocence, and open my mouth for my
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025821_0011_0FCF2791037D5368"/>
oppreſſed brethren, who cannot open theirs for themſelves. I aſk no pecuniary advantage for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, neither poſt nor penſion. I feel the ſweets of American Liberty—I truſt I am ſenſible of, and thankful for the favor; and am not eaſy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of mine ſo partially, and ſee, hear and know of my brethren and fellow mortals being ſo arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily and cruelly deprived of theirs, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my proteſt. I deſire to have this favor and bleſſing continued to myſelf and poſterity, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but view the tenure, both to myſelf and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, as very precarious, while a plea is founded on the general conſtitution, in bar of the rights of man; and the equal diſtribution of juſtice being confirmed, that the views of a righteous govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be, to promote the welfare of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind univerſally, as well thoſe of other nations, as the ſubjects or citizens of its own; and therefore, that it is obligatory on the United States, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the citizens thereof injuring the inhabitants of Africa, as thoſe of one ſtate the citizens of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and I doubt not in the leaſt, if Africa was in a ſituation to ſend fleets and armies here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate, but Congreſs would ſoon deviſe ways, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating the Conſtitution, to prevent our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens from aggravating them. The almoſt daily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts I have of the inhumanity perpetrated in theſe ſtates on this race of men, diſtreſſes me night and day, and brings the ſubject of the Slave Trade with more preſſure on my ſpirit; and I believe I feel a meaſure of the ſame obligation that the Prophet did when he was ordered to cry aloud, ſpare not, liſt up thy
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025821_0012_0FCF2792A4166740"/>
voice like a trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins. And here I think I can ſhew, that our nation are revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the law of God, the law of reaſon and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and the juſt principles of government; and with rapid ſtrides eſtabliſhing tyranny and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to prove which, I need do no more than oppoſe the preſent conduct of the nation, to that part of it which I have now brought to your view, from the former journals of Congreſs, and then mention the ſanction the African Slave Trade at this time has from the general government; in proof of which I may refer to the condition on which Congreſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the ceſſion of the Weſtern Territory of North Carolina, viz. <hi>That no regulation made or to be made ſhall tend to emancipate ſlaves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am concerned that the leaders of the people may not cauſe them to err, or ſtrengthen them in error; the plea now is by ſtate Legiſlators, as well as other claſſes of citizens, and even thoſe abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dealers in the perſons of men, that Congreſs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizes the traffic as I myſelf now believe you vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually do.</p>
                  <p>If your diſapprobation of this trade as a body was publicly known to be ſincere, I believe it would have a good effect; and if you are ſo it is my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the people has a right to know and expect it from you. I am perſuaded, nine tenths of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the United States reprobate the African Trade, and conſider every ſlave imported an injury to the public; and that they repoſe confidence in your wiſdom as guardians of the nation, to prevent
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025821_0013_0FCF279943862D08"/>
its injury; and that herein you betray the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in you, which is indeed a great and weighty truſt, even to do that which of right ought to be done by the nation; therefore it requires on this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry important ſubject your deep and ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, what you can do ſo as to obtain the favor of Divine Providence to this land, which I do indeed believe will be marked with ſomething very different, if ſuch an inhuman traffic is continued.</p>
                  <p>Humane petitions have been preſented, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in Congreſs benevolent feelings for the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our fellow citizens under cruel bondage to Turks and Algerines, and that the national power and influence might be exerted for their relief; with this virtuous application I unite, but lament that any of my countrymen, who are diſtinguiſhed as men eminently qualified for public ſtation, ſhould be ſo enſlaved by illiberal prejudice, as to treat with contempt a like ſolicitude for another claſs of men ſtill more grievouſly oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>I proſeſs freely, and am willing my profeſſion was known over the world, that I feel the calls of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity as ſtrong towards an African in America, as to an American in Algiers, both being my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; eſpecially as I am informed the Algerine treats his ſlave with more humanity; and I believe the ſin of oppreſſion on the part of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, is greateſt in the ſight of the father of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of mankind.</p>
                  <p>I hope ſome will excuſe my inſerting, in this apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logetic expoſtulation, a few texts of ſcripture as they revive—I truſt there are ſome of our rulers yet

believe in the authenticity of the holy ſcriptures; what revives now, is the declaration of our Lord, Matt. 25 chap. and 41 verſe. <hi>Then ſhall he ſay alſo to them on the left hand, depart from me ye curſed,</hi> &amp;c. They alſo ſhall anſwer him, ſaying— <hi>When ſaw we thee an hungred, or athirſt, or a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and did not miniſter unto thee?</hi> His anſwer then you may read, <hi>Inaſmuch as you, did it not to the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That I may not be thought to treſpaſs on your patience on this momentous ſubject, after repeating my ſpecial requeſt, that you would without delay exert your power and influence to fruſtrate the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious purpoſe of thoſe mercenaries, who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps now on their voyage from Liverpool to Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, to bring to ſome of the Southern ſtates cargoes of innocent human beings into cruel, unconditional bondage; the grounds I have for this apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are I believe not unknown to ſome among you. I will draw towards a concluſion, with a quotation from the addreſs of Congreſs to the Aſſembly of Jamaica, dated 26th of July 1775.</p>
                  <p>"We receive uncommon pleaſure from obſerving the principles of our righteous oppoſition diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by your approbation: we feel the warmeſt gratitude for your pathetic mediation in our behalf with the crown—but are you to blame? mournful experience tells us, that petitions are often rejected, while the ſentiments and conduct of the petitioners entitle what they offer to a happier fate."</p>

                  <p>OBSERVING in the Journals of Congreſs, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us in the laſt Gazette, mention is made of the reading and returning a Memorial ſubſcribed by Warner Mifflin: As the deſign of publiſhing thoſe Journals is, I preſume, to give their conſtituents the means of forming an opinion of the doings of their repreſentatives, I therefore requeſt the encloſed copy of ſaid Memorial may have a place in the next Gazette, as without it, no ſafe opinion can be formed upon that article in the Journals. The Memorialiſt has been well known to many, in almoſt every ſtate in the union, to be a man of good ſenſe and ſolid diſcernment, of a plentiful eſtate and unfullied character, a citizen of one of the ſouthern ſtates, and a firm friend to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal liberty of mankind, both in principle and practice. Whether the ſentiments in that Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial could conſiſtently warrant the epithet <hi>fanatical,</hi> from any one Member of Congreſs, who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to believe in the moral government of the world by a Supreme Being, the reader will judge.</p>

                  <p>HAVING for a long time felt my mind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with a religious engagement on your account, and a belief, that if meaſures are not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to redreſs the wrongs, and alleviate the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and oppreſſions of the African race in theſe ſtates, the Almighty will manifeſt his diſpleaſure in a more conſpicuous manner than has yet appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the conſideration whereof excites me, in his fear, earneſtly to ſolicit, and ſolemnly to warn you, to exert your power and influence, that right and juſtice may be done in this important caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I have alſo been affected with the following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Prophet, Ezek. iii. 20.</hi> When a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man doth turn from his righteouſneſs, and commit iniquity, and I lay a ſtumbling-block before him, he ſhall die; becauſe thou haſt not given him warning, he ſhall die in his ſin, and his righteouſneſs which he hath done ſhall not he remembered, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
                  <p>21. Nevertheleſs, if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous ſin not, and he doth not ſin, he ſhall ſurely live, becauſe he is warned, alſo thou haſt delivered thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:025821_0019_0FCF27A483A9F530"/>Now I cannot view the declaration made by the firſt Congreſs, in ſubſtance to amount to any thing ſhort of a ſolemn covenant entered into, with the God of heaven and the whole earth, viz <hi>We hold theſe truths to be ſelf-evident, that all men are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty,</hi> &amp;c. and which remains obligatory on the preſent Congreſs ſo to conſider. How then have thoſe rights become alienated, that Americans ſhould be permitted to continue to ravage the coaſt of Africa, thereby promoting murder, pillaging, plundering and burning its towns, and enſlaving its inhabitants?—And in the United States, while ſome of thoſe very men, who perhaps with their own hands ſubſcribed the aforeſaid declaration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſupreme Legiſlature,' that avaricious men ſhould be permitted to paſs through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſteal, buy, traffic, barter and exchange the blacks, as though they were indeed brute beaſts, ſeparating huſband from wife, parents from chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, even mothers from infant babes, yea, from all that is dear to men in this world, except life, and indeed that alſo, as there are divers inſtances of their being murdered; others in iron ſetters, huddled into gaol until the number wanted is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, then ſtowed into veſſels for tranſportation to foreign ports, and ſold into perpetual ſlavery, not permitting a parting leave between the neareſt ties of nature—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:025821_0020_0FCF27A7535C63F0"/>My ſoul now revolts at the infernal crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt innocent perſons, without provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Oh let me now beſeech you, not to think it too much degradation for you to reflect, was this the lot of one of your beloved delicate wives, your tender babes, or near relatives, how then would you feel!</p>
                  <p>Do not you with me believe, that there is a God of juſtice, who will finally recompence unto all men according to the fruit of their doings; and that he doth at one view, by his all penetrating eye, behold the actions of men over the face of the globe? if ſo, how do we think he will look on the rulers of this land, when he beholds many of them faring ſumptuouſly every day, living in eaſe and fulneſs, and at the very time that they are invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto themſelves inſtruments of muſic, and ſpending their precious time in vain theatrical and Other amuſements, remember not the afflictions of their ſuffering African brethren, who in this country may be loaded with irons, under all the pangs of ſorrow the human heart can be capable of enduring, for no crime whatever, but becauſe it pleaſed God to ſuffer them to come into the world with a black ſkin—will this not make him your enemy, who is a God that is no reſpecter of perſons?</p>
                  <p>I crave your ſerious attention to this important ſubject; and that while you may feel an animated warmth to fill your minds, when engaged reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natives of this land, you ſuffer a turn of

thought reſpecting the conduct of Americans in Africa, and in this country alſo towards Africans, and ſee if any ſavage cruelty of the natives can exceed that of the white people towards the Africans, conſidering our ſuperior advantage of civilization, under the light of the goſpel. Let us conſider we are informed, that the meaſure we mete to others is to be meted to us; and likewiſe, that we may ſo conduct, as never to feel the effects (in the full extent) of the declaration of the Almighty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly delivered to a highly favored people, in fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of complying with their covenants and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, viz. <hi>Jerom.</hi> xxxiv.17. <hi>Behold I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a liberty for you, ſaith the Lord, to the ſword, to the famine, and to the peſtilence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is there not reaſon to acknowledge, that we have ſeen in ſome meaſure fulfilled a part of the firſt? are there not traces of the ſecond? and do we not acknowledge, that all three are ſubſervient to Almighty power! and has our nation fulfilled its covenant? Oh! my countrymen and fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, be ſerious on this ſubject, and allow me the liberty of a free expoſtulation with you. I feel for the welfare of my country, and my fellow-citizens, every one of whom I love; and believing myſelf eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way equally intereſted with the largeſt part of your body in the welfare of my country, I hoped you would allow me freely thus far to relieve my pained heart, who feel ſo much on account of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cruelties exerciſed on an unoffending people,
