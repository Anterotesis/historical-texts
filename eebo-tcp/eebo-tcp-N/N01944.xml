      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Report from Caſtle-William, is ſo mean a thing, ſo Little in Argument, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh in Temper, its Beneath a Wiſe Man to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it; at leaſt no otherways than you ſee in the Incloſed. But however to ſatisfy your ſelf as to my Domeſtick Affairs, which you tho' ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Related are a ſtranger to.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſome time within leſs then Three Years, we took out <hi>1000</hi>l. and put into the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Bank, an Eſtate of <hi>2000</hi>l. which we would not take Five and Twenty Hundred for now. (Indeed ſuch fat things Draw theſe Hungry Crows by a ſtrange Inſtinct) We thought it might be very pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fit ſo to do. And thro' Mercy we have Reaped great Eaſe and Benefit by it. For that we have ſolved our former Money Obligations, and furniſhed the buſineſs of the Family (under your Brother's Sole management) to very great purpoſe, for ſince that our Buſineſs has gone on with ſuch Succeſs, that we have pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed into the Bank about <hi>200</hi> l. with the Interest, and have another <hi>100</hi> l. ready to anſwer in that Affair.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002310_0007_0fdb1ee71c00c320"/>
And not only ſo, but the Temporal Buſineſs of the Family is ſo well Qualified and Adjuſted, that thro' Divine goodneſs, and by the Aſſiſtance of the Auſpicious and Proſperous Bills, we do not fall ſhort of Three Hundred Pounds Annual Income. And not only ſo, but tho' the Peviſh Gentleman (If he be a Man) does allow if we put in <hi>2000</hi>l. which is already grown in Value, but alſo their Remains in our hands no ways intangled by the Bank, in Rich houſen, home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad, Remote Lands, and other Eſtates to the Value of One Thouſand Pounds, or not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. That conſidering what we have Done in leſs than Three Years towards the ſolving the Bank, &amp;c. I am full of Aſſurance that in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Six Years, by Divine Aid, and by a Frugal and Prudent Management we are quite out of Danger, as to Crows and Vultures,</p>
            <p>Therefore what I have Wrote on the Bank of Credit, was purely in Love to my Country, that all Men in their Affairs, may be as Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous as I have been. At Leaſt that our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try may Univerſally Flouriſh in their Outward Affairs.</p>
