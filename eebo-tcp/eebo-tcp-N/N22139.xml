            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>From the foregoing return the public will be enabled to form ſome judgment of the future advantage that the poor of this City may hope to derive from this inſtitution, which has benevolence alone for its object. The families of many perſons, whoſe daily ſupport depends upon their daily labor, not being able to defray the expence of phyſicians, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and medicine, frequently ſuffer great inconvenience when ſick, for want of medical aid; and others, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like circumſtances, ſubmit to the expence, often employ perſons with a ſmall ſhare of medical knowledge, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which life is ſometimes loſt, and at beſt involve themſelves and families in difficulties, from which, in ſome inſtances, they rarely recover. The many advantages which have been derived from ſimilar inſtitutions, both in Europe and America, inſpire a pleaſing hope in the minds of the Managers, that ſuch of their fellow citizens, who, in this and many inſtances, have manifeſted a ſpirit of liberality, which juſtly entitles them to the warmeſt approbation, will continue to give this inſtitution their ſpecial patronage.</p>

That the Diſpenſary might be ſupplied with the beſt medicines, and at firſt hand, the Managers ſome time paſt imported a conſiderable aſſortment from Europe, which are paid for, and they have now remaining on hand medicines and furniture to the amount of about 160l.—They have alſo imported four complete ſets of aparatus, for the recovery of perſons apparently drowned, which are depoſited at the following places, to wit.</p>

               <p>The preſent annual account of ſubſcriptions to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſary, after deducting the expences for collecting, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 400l. and this ſtatement is made without making any allowance for ſubſcribers who may happen to die, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the city; ſo that in all probability, the next an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual revenue of the Diſpenſary, as the ſubſcriptions now ſtand, will fall ſhort of the ſum of 400l. above mentioned; and as the yearly expences of the Diſpenſary, including houſe-rent, phyſician, ſurgeon, and apothecary's ſalary, amount to nearly the aforeſaid ſum, it will be impoſſible for the managers to extend its uſefulneſs to the degree they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wiſh, unleſs many of their fellow citizens, who have ſufficient ability, and who have not yet honoured the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution with their names, will come forward and give it their patronage. From the above repreſentation, the public will ſee the propriety and neceſſity of the managers ſoliciting freſh contributions, for the ſupport of an inſtitution, ever open and ready to afford medical relief to the indigent ſick.</p>
