            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Premonition to the Reader.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the ſaving Change of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Hearts, is the ſuperna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ural Work of God alone; yet he brings it about in a way agreeable to their natural Practices, and Endowments as reaſonable Beings; and uſes rational proper means with them for that End. Hence are all the Inſtructions, Motives, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and Expoſtulations, which are in the Scriptures; which are not only for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Progreſs of the renew'd and ſanctified; but alſo for the Converſion of the ungodly, and Sinners; as may be abundantly ſeen through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out both Teſtaments. God in his Word, deals with Man, even in his Apoſtace unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Condition, as an intelligent Creature, by all the Topicks of Argument and Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perſwaſion. Accordingly thoſe whom Chriſt employs as his Ambaſſadors, in the Goſpel-Miniſtry, are to labour not only for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Good and Comfort of the Regenerate Children of God; but alſo with the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd and unholy, for their ſaving Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by all thoſe rational Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God has furniſh'd them in his Word. And 'tis as plainly both the Duty and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Sinners (tho' they cannot ſavin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly Change themſelves yet) to take up themſelves, and as much as poſſible conform themſelves to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005132_0003_1017436EABFD8D08"/>God's declared Will; and, in that Way, to ſeek inceſſantly for renewing Grace, and a ſaving vital Union with Jeſus Chriſt. This is but to act as becomes rational Creatures in their Circumſtances: 'Tis the Command of God, and the only Way of reaſonable Hope.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to theſe Things, I have in the following Diſcourſe addreſs'd the Reaſon, and conſidering Faculty of the Irreligious, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Religion, and their Souls eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: And ſhew'd from many Conſiderations, the unparellel'd Unreaſonableneſs and Brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of Irreligion and Impenitence; which might be ſufficient to confound with Shame and deep Concern, eſpecially ſuch as highly Value themſelves upon that truly valuable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of the Human Nature, their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Reaſon, and yet live irreligious and ungodly Lives. As I hinted already I know Mankind are ſo far depraved and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that nothing but the Almighty to change and reclaim them: But yet ſuitable and adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted means are to be uſed for that End, both by the Preacher, and the Sinner himſelf. And it is by, and in the uſe of theſe that God ordinarily Works this Effect.</p>
            <p>I think ſuch a Sermon as this is eſpecially ſeaſonable at this Time, when the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ravians,</hi> lately come to theſe Parts of the World, Teach, that Miniſters are not to uſe ſuch Methods with the ungodly; and, that ungodly Sinners themſelves, are not to uſe any endeavours this Way, in ſeeking to God for their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation: From the ſpecious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005132_0004_10174371B29B5E38"/>that Salvation is not of Works, and that Chriſt needs not our help to convert us: As may be clearly ſeen in Count <hi>Zinzendorff</hi>'s printed Diſcourſes. This is to make Man like a brute or a block, rather than a Reaſonable Creature; and fairly to lay the Reins on li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencious Sinners Necks, and allow them to run where they Pleaſe. It is very true Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is not of Works, either by a Merit of Congruity or Condignity (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> Term and Diſtinguiſh it) ſo that Sinners ought not to ſet about reforming, with a View to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe God, or to excite his Love and Favour towards them, by any imagin'd excellency in their Works of Obedience, as I have carefully directed in the Cloſe of the Sermon: And yet it is as true, that the utmoſt Efforts of unregenerate Sinners to obſerve the Divine Law, and ſeek the Mercy of God, and their Souls Salvation, is their indiſpenſible Duty, their reaſonable Service, and God's expreſs Command; or elſe a great Part of the Bible is wrong, wherein they are enjoyned to <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, Luke</hi> 13.24. And, <hi>all Men every where is commanded to repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath appointed a Day in which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs. Acts</hi> 17.30, 31. with numberleſs other Places. If God requires the ungodly to turn from their irreligious Courſes, to ſeek and endeavour to ſerve him; the they ought to do ſo: And that under the higheſt Pains, of his terrible and dread Diſpleaſure. If God does not require it of them, then it is not their Sin not to do ſo; and conſequently they are no Sinners, but doing Right enough; for where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion: And then conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005132_0005_10174374B924CCA8"/>again, they have no Hell nor Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to fear; for where there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, there is no Puniſhment, in a juſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Thus you may ſee where this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine leads. May the Lord preſerve People from ſuch a dangerous and fearfull Snare, which tends to del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de them to their Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo, preſerve them from reſting upon means, and putting their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the place of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; which is as fatal upon the other Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Reſting upon means is inconſiſtent with, and a Bar in the way of believing in Chriſt; but the uſe of means, as means, is not; but is the expreſs Command of God, and the Sinners Duty. It is ridiculous arguing here, that Chriſt needs not Sinners help to convert them: For, who ever ima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in'd that they were to uſe means, with a View to help Chriſt to Convert them. But this is not a proper Place to purſue this Argument in its full Latitude. What I have already ſaid may be ſufficient here.</p>
            <p>I know not of any thing in the following Diſcourſe, that I am any way obliged to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for, except it be the high Deſcription I have given of the Repentance which may be attained to, by unregenerate Men. I wou'd have it obſerved, that I expreſly include the ordinary Concurrence of the Holy Spirit: And how far the Spirit of God may concur, by way of common Operation, with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of natural Men, I think we cannot Determine. I am ſatisfy'd that when the Holy
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005132_0006_101743763B04CF78"/>Spirit lays hold of Sinners with a Deſign of their ſaving Converſion, he frequently brings them to ſuch a Degree of Repentance, even before the ſaving Change is wrought in their Hearts. I ſhall detain the Reader no longer from the Peruſal of the Sermon: And may the Lord help you to peruſe it to profit.</p>

            <p>The great God repreſents himſelf in a familiar condeſcending way, after the manner of Man, as expecting and hoping that the means which he had uſed with them, might poſſibly have had ſome good effect upon them, in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and ſo be hearkned to hear what they were a ſaying about it.

            </p>
            <p>3d. The Text declares how wilfully and brutiſhly reſolute theſe People were in their wicked Courſes.

This Compariſon implies in it theſe two things, <hi>1ſt.</hi> The brutiſh Unreaſonableneſs, bold Preſumption, and Fool-Hardineſs of Sinners, who go on in their ſinful Courſes againſt all the awfull warnings of Heaven, and all the reſtraints of Reaſon and Conſcience.

He is a going wilfully on to his own Ruin and Deſtruction, as the Horſe ruſhes into the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, into the midſt of Dangers and of Deaths. And ſo this Branch of the Text affords us theſe two Propoſitions of Truth more, <hi>1ſt,</hi> That it is brutiſh, irrational, and wilful for Sinners to go on ſtill in their ſinful Courſes, againſt all the Inſtructions and ſolemn Warnings of God's Word.

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are Truths clearly enough contain'd in this Verſe. <hi>I hearkned and heard,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak ſomething to each of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in their order. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> I ſay a Reformation in Sinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall a little illuſtrate the Truth of this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſhew what we are to learn from it, and the uſe to be made of it in Practice, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briefly, and then paſs to the next Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>The Truth of this Propoſition will clearly appear by conſidering and comparing one or two things. <hi>1ſt.</hi> That Sinners are rational Creatures, and ſo ought to be influenced and wrought upon in matters of Practice, if they would not forfeit all claim to that Character, by rational Means, by powerful convincing Arguments and Conſiderations. If there is no dealing with mankind, and perſwading them in this Method of rational Argument, they act no more like rational Beings than the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005132_0014_1017438ECBE359A8"/>brute Beaſts: To direct us in our Choice and Practice, is certainly the very greateſt uſe and benefit of our underſtanding and Reaſon; and therefore it might be juſtly expected from rational Creatures, in this Caſe as well as all others, that they ſhou'd be ſway'd by Reaſons, which they are capable to underſtand, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, luſt and blind wilfuneſs, they put off the Man and put on the Beaſt: Yea, much worſe, they rather put on the Devil, acting againſt the light of Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which Beaſts do not, and ſo are the neareſt reſemblance to the diabolical Nature; indeed a rational Creature, acting croſs to the very confeſs'd Laws of Reaſon, and that in matters of infinite and eternal Moment, is the moſt unaccountable kind of being within the Compaſs of the whole univerſe. It could hardly be believ'd that there could poſſibly be ſuch an irregular ſelf-repugnant, obli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e kind of thing in the whole Syſtem of being, did not ſad Experience ſo undeniably confirm it: ſuch a being would ſeem a ſort of natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, and the very Mention of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>And then 2dly, Conſider, That the Meſſages of God's Word to Sinners for their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Repentance, are the moſt ſolemn, weighty, and powerful of any Thing that can poſſibly be propos'd to the Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>He would be juſtly look'd upon as a moſt demented and brutiſh Man, who wou'd not

The great God lays before Sinners in his Word the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Equity, and Excellency of Holineſs; the juſt neceſſary Title and Sovereign claim which he has to their Obedience, both as he is a God of inconceivable Glory and infinite Perfections, worthy to be ſerv'd honour'd and ador'd by all rational beings beſide; and as they are his Creatures, created by him for that End, to glorify and ſerve him and enjoy the higheſt bleſſedneſs in him; and as he is their conſtant Preſerver, the upholder of their Lives and giver of all their Benefits; upon all which Accounts they owe themſelves entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him as his own Property, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his moral Government, by a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and inalienable Right.

O Sinners, will you, dare you trample under Foot the Blood of the Son of God! Diſregard and under-value the deareſt Love of the Father, Son and bleſſed Spirit! And go on in theſe Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeſs, which coſt a life that was worth <hi>ten Thouſand</hi> Worlds to redeem you from them Farther, the great God ſets before them in his Word, the awful and diſmal Scene of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Pains, Miſeries, and Horrors, which they ſhall infallibly endure for ever without Regeneration and Converſion. He tells you, O ye rebellious Sinners, that if ye do not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and Repent, ſeek his Mercy with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled pained Hearts, and turn to his Ways, the Damnation of Hell, will infallibly be your Portion to all Eternity: That you are every Day in Danger of being caſt into never ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ending Anguiſh, Pain and Horrour for your continued Rebellion. Now, are not here Reaſons for Sinners Repentance, turning from the Ways of Sin, and moſt earneſt ſeeking the Favour and Mercy of God, of the greateſt Weight Imaginable? And are not Sinners ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures, to underſtand, conſider and apply theſe Things: How reaſonably, then might their compliance with them be expected.

               <hi>2dly.</hi> But I muſt proceed to conſider the <hi>2d.</hi> Propoſition, which is, that the Repentance which God requires of Sinners, upon his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them by the ſolemn Meſſages of his
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005132_0020_1017439F72D79060"/>Word, muſt be attended with Confeſſion, Shame, and Sorrow.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall a little farther open up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Repentance intended in this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and my Deſign is not particularly to open up the nature of the ſaving Grace of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is only in regenerate and ſanctify'd Perſons, and neceſſarily requires the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles of Sanctifying Grace implanted in the Soul by the Holy Ghoſt, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Spring of it; but the Repentance which I deſign to ſpeak to, and which I think is the Repentance intended in the Text, is that which Sinners thro' the Means and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of God's Word faithfully deliver'd to them, may generally, by the ordinary Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God's Spirit perform, if they act ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally and faithfully as they may and ought to do; which Repentance God requires them to perform as the Way of their ſeeking, and moſt hopeful Means for obtaining his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy and ſanctifying Grace thro' Chriſt Jeſus. It is, in ſhort that Repentance which the Lord looks that Sinners ſhould generally perform, ſuch as are not judicially harden'd at leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom he has ſent the Meſſages of his Word for that End, when he ſays, <hi>Hearkened and heard to find whether any Man repented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>And in this Repentance two Things are to be conſidered: The Thing if ſelf ſubſtantially and its Qualifications or neceſſary Adjuncts. And 1ſt. This Repentance ſtrictly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially conſider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in it ſelf is a turning from, and oppoſing of Sin, and an Application to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005132_0021_101743A582263778"/>Duties of Religion, univerſally both in Heart and Life. A Sinner never practices any Thing like Repentance till he comes to this; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake entirely his ſinful Courſes, withſtand all Snares and Temptations to them, and wreſtle againſt the inward Corruptions of his Heart; to betake himſelf to the preſcribed Ways of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and moſt ſolemnly and earneſtly to ſeek the Mercy and Favour of an offended and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God. Penitent <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſays, <hi>What have I to do any move with Idols, Heſ.</hi> 14.8. repenting <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> do and ſeek the Lord their God, going and weeping ſaying, <hi>Come and let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten Jer.</hi> 50.4, 5. How dreadfully are they deceiv'd then who think that a few Checks of Conſcience for their Sin after the Commiſſion of it, and ſome ſlighty Confeſſions of it before God is true Repentance, when yet they ſtill go on in the ſame Practices? Who think that their gallings of Conſcience now and then, and their ſuperficial Acknowledgments will ſecure them from all Danger, and make up for their continuing Wickedneſſes and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the Ways of Godlineſs? How dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſay, are ſuch poor Creatures deceiv'd in their Imaginations? Eſpecially ſeeing Perſons may repent, even ſo far as I have deſcribed, without being in a ſaving State, and fitly qualify'd for eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> As to the Qualifications of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, they are Confeſſion, Shame and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. 1. Confeſſion; to repent with Confeſſion of their Sin is what the Lord requires of Sinners who enjoy the Light of his Holy Word. This was his Complaint againſt the obſtinate Jews in our Text, <hi>No Man repented him of his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005132_0022_101743A704B88EA0"/>Wickedneſs,</hi> ſaying, <hi>what have I done?</hi> No Man among them repented acknowledging the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sinfulneſs of his paſt Practice. It is not enough that Perſons barely acknowledge the ſinful Actions and Neglects that they have been guilty of; there is no doubt of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging them if they remember them; for it is not poſſible that they can deny theſe Things before God whatever they may do to Men; ſo far as their Memory ſerves them they can't but be ſelf conſcious of what they have done or not done; but they muſt acknowledge and be ſenſible of their Sinfulneſs and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in theſe Actions and Omiſſions. That the general Courſe of their Practice has been a Courſe of wicked Rebellion and Diſobedience againſt God. While Sinners continue to juſtify their Practices, and tho' they will confeſs in general Terms that they are very ſinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures yet will hardly acknowledge it in any one particular Inſtance, or if ſome inward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of their Sin in ſome or many particular Things be extorted from them by the Light of their Conſciences, while they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſtill to leſſen the Sinfulneſs of theſe Things in their own View, to make it appear as very little and trivial, or always plead Excuſes and make Apologies for themſelves to their Conſciences, I ſay, ſo long as it is thus with Sinners they are far far from Repentance. And yet, alas, thus it is with Multitudes of periſhing Souls who are rotting in the Graves, in the Stench and Pollution of Sin; they are willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blinded by the Devil to look upon their Sins as very Trifles; This is but a ſmall Evil, and that is not much amiſs, the Effect of human Frailty, and the other Thing is not ſo bad as many are guilty of, <hi>I wiſh I may never do

In evangelical and ſaving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance the Terror and Dread of God's Wrath for Sin is chiefly taken away from the Conſcience, by the Sinner's cloſure with Chriſt by Faith, and believing on him, but yet he hates Sin and grieves for it from another and more noble Principle, a Senſe of its inherent Baſeneſs, and a true Love to the bleſſed God which is ſhed abroad in his Heart, whence he is moſt affectionately inclined and engaged to pleaſe and honour him, and is ſorrowful that he can no better ſerve him. Whenever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance comes to have theſe two Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then it's a bleſſed Evidence of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's being a regenerate Child of God, and in a ſaving State.</p>
            <p>Now, this Repentance and Humiliation which I have been diſcourſing of, is neceſſary for Sinners to practice in order to their Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and the true Converſion of their Souls to God; in order to the Sanctification of their Hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, without which it is impoſſible for them to be ſay'd; <hi>I or except a Man he born of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God</hi> John 3.5. <hi>and without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord</hi> Heb. 12.14.</p>

            <p>But, how much more brutiſh and irrational is it for Perſons to go on ſtill in a Courſe of Sin and Rebellion againſt God, who are favour'd with the cleareſt Light and ſtrongeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Holy Word, moſt ſolemnly and repeatedly urged upon them: Arguments juſtly brought from all the Topicks of rational Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, from the intrinſick Reaſonableneſs, Beauty, and Excellence of Obedience to the great God; and conſequently the unreaſonableneſs and unſpeakable Baſeneſs of Sin, from the endearing and tender Obligations of Goodneſs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſo from that amiable Diſpoſition of Gratitude and thankful Senſe of undeſerv'd Favour, and from the Topicks of immortal Happineſs and Miſery in the Life to come, both which are Unſpeakable in their Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Degree.

            <p>The Truth of this Obſervation may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appear from what has been ſaid already up-upon the firſt Head of Doctrine, for if a Reformation from Sin, and earneſt Endeavours in ſeeking after the Favour and Mercy of God, may be reaſonably expected of Sinners, to whom God has ſent the Meſſages of his Word for that End, then certainly their Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Continuance in Sin after all is moſt

They dont go on in ſuch a Courſe becauſe they can juſtify it upon a fair Trial to their own Conſciences, much leſs to the Almighty God, but becauſe they are inclin'd to it, and ſo WILL do it. You that Live in a Courſe of Sin and ſecure unconcernedneſs about your eternal States, I am well perſwaded that the moſt plauſible Defence which you can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer for your ſelves will not be able to ſtand an impartial Trial, even yourſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judges; whence its manifeſt that you act wilfully and brutiſhly, <hi>and turn to your Courſe juſt as the Horſe Ruſhes into the Battle</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider but the Reaſons which I have brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention'd under the firſt Propoſition, which God offers you in his Word for your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and earneſt Application to him for his Mercy, and then Try if you can find any more weighty to oppoſe to them.</p>
            <p>But farther, is it not irrational and brutiſh for Perſons to be chiefly taken up about pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Things, and little or nothing concern'd about the Condition in the Time to come? This is the very Caſe of impenitent Sinners; and I may Appeal to the World if this is not Acting like the moſt ſenſeleſs and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Brutes in the whole Creation.

            <p>Again, is it not moſt irrational and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh to go on in the Face, of the cleareſt Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moſt awful Threatning, without Fear or Turning? This is likewiſe the Caſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners amongſt us. How dreadful are the righteous Threatnings of the true and faithful God in his holy Oracles againſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tranſgreſſors of his Law, neglectors of his Commands, and ſlighters of his Authority and offer'd Mercy, and yet (bold Mortals!) they will not be deter'd: Yea, tho' the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Threats and Comminations of the great God, the ſovereign Law-giver and ruler of the Univerſe, may be often denounced in their hearing, ſo that they might ſee the awful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Heaven, as it were pointed at their very Breaſts, yet they brutiſhly ſlight all theſe Things, and boldly Ruſh on in the ſame Courſe, <hi>as the Horſe ruſhes into the Bottle.</hi> An elegant Deſcription of <hi>the Horſe</hi>'s <hi>ruſhing to the Battle,</hi> you may find, <hi>Job.</hi> 39. from verſe 21 to 26, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly accommodated to the Cuſtom of thoſe antient Times, when Battle were generally Fought by cloſe Engagements, and ſo the two contended Armies violently ruſh'd upon each other. <hi>He paweth in the Valey, and rejoyceth in his Strength: He goeth on to meet the armed Men: He mocketh at Fear, and is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Thus, I think the Truth of this Propoſition is clearly manifeſt, and how little Cauſe then have obſtinate Sinners, to Pride themſelves of their great Wiſdom; or rather, what Cauſe have you to bluſh and be aſham'd, when you think how you debaſe yourſelves to the Level of the brute Creation, vilely diſgracing the Excellency and Dignity of the human Soul.

               <hi>5thly.</hi> In the laſt Place: A Courſe of ſtupid Security, groundleſs Peace, and unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about their eternal Condition is another Courſe whein Sinners are going on to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. By Perſons living in ſuch fatal Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and unconcernedneſs, I mean all ſuch, of whatſoever Character and Converſation they may otherwiſe be, who have not the ſanctifying Graces of God's Spirit in their Souls, who have not the Diſpoſition of true Holineſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in their Hearts by Regeneration, but have the natural Averſion of their Wills to God ſtill abiding and prevailing in them, and yet are ſtupidly inſenſible of their ſinful and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Eſtate, of the deplorable Condition they are in, little diſtreſs'd or concern'd about it, not earneſtly ſeeking after God for his renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſanctifying Grace and a ſtate of Favour with him. Theſe Perſons, tho' they may be pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty moral for the moſt part in their Practices and likewiſe have an outward Form and Appearance of Religion; yet, their Souls utterly unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005132_0040_101743E00DFF34C8"/>and vile in the Sight of God: They have never laid hold on Jeſus Chriſt and embraced him by a true and living Faith for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſo ſlight the glorious Mediator and croſs the Deſign of the whole Goſpel; they do not truly love God above all Things and moſt affectionately deſire to pleaſe and ſerve him, making it the great Deſign of their Lives, from a Senſe of their Obligations and a Principle of Love, to live to his Honour and Glory; and thus the very Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their Souls is directly contrary to God and Holineſs: And while they are going on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this unſanctify'd Condition with ſecure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and whole unconcerned Hearts as if all were well with them, they are heedleſsly and very irrationaly going on to their eternal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And, alas, this deep ſleep, unreaſonable damning Security and unconcernedneſs (as it may be juſty term'd) very generally prevails among Mankind: They are ſo taken up about other Concerns (and many of them very trifling of no Moment even as to the preſent Life) that they don't take time throughly to conſider and examine the State of their Souls in Relation to the future World: But, as if that were a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no importance, readily take it for granted that they muſt be in a ſafe Condition without ever duly enquiring, by the Rule of God's Word and unbyaſs'd Reaſon, whether they have the Qualifications neceſſary for the Heavenly State; and ſo enjoy a very unreaſonable Peace and Quiet in their Minds againſt the plaineſt Evidence. Theſe are briefly ſome of the ſinful Courſes wherein Perſons are going on to their own Ruin and Deſtruction, and that againſt all rational Means that can poſſibly be uſed with them, <hi>even as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battle.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:005132_0041_101743E1F3467700"/>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> What are the Dangers and Miſeries which in theſe Courſes they are ruſhing into? In a Word, they lye open and expoſed at all times to all thoſe Plagues and Evils which God at any Time inflicts upon his Enemies either in this Life or that which is to come: And if they are not puniſh'd with ſuch ſevere Strokes of Juſtice in this Life, it is not owing to the Goodneſs or ſafety of their State, or any Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which they have againſt it, but merely to the free and gracious Forbearance of God, whereby for a Time he defers the Strokes of his Wrath; <hi>for God is angry with the Wicked every Day, Pſ.</hi> 7, 11. And however they may proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this Life there is a ſolemn Time of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and Payments haſtning on. But, more particularly, there are two or three Dangers and Miſeries I would briefly mention, which ſuch reſolute Sinners are apparently ruſhing upon. 1. Being judicially given up of God to hardneſs of Heart, ſearedneſs of Conſcience, and ſo to their own Luſts without the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. Thus God dealt with the Heathen World for abuſing the ſmaller Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the Apoſtle infomrs us <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Therefore God gave them up to Uncleanneſs, thro' the Luſts of their own Hearts,</hi> v. 24. <hi>For this Cauſe God gave them up unto vile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ffections,</hi> v. 20. <hi>And even as they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate Mind, to do th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005132_0042_101743E806B479F8"/>come into; and is it not an awfully dangerous one? All Hope of their Converſion and Salvation is then almoſt quite gone. <hi>Woe unto them when God departs from them Hoſ.</hi> 9.12. 2. An utter and dreadful deſpair of Mercy even in this Life is a Miſery which ſuch Sinners are in Danger of. The Lord ſome times in this manner gives ſome Foretaſtes of Hell upon this Earth to ſuch as have thus gone on in Sin againſt all Light and Convictions, for a Warning and Terror to others. <hi>Cain, Judas,</hi> and, in later Times, <hi>Francis Spira, John Child</hi> and others have been awful Inſtances of this. For all ſo ſtupid, and ſtout againſt God as Sinners are now, he may paſs the Sentence of their eternal Damnation in their own Boſoms yet before they die, and cauſe them to feel ſomething of the Deſparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Horror of the Damned World. A wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſiſting in the Ways of Sin againſt all the Light and Warning of the Word of God is the ready Way to this Miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> In the laſt Place, ſuch obſtinate wilful Sinners are ruſhing into an awfully aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Damnation in the next World. Their Pain and Torment thro' all Eternity will be more intollerable than that of others, as has been made appear upon the foregoing Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. O! Sinners, without a ſaving Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God this will be your dreadful Portion in a little Time: And can you think of this without a trembling Heart, without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern or Diſtreſs; you know not how ſoon Death may put an End to the Day of Life, and that will be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ievably gone for ever if you are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in this impenitent State: You ſtand as it were upon the very Brink of the burning Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005132_0043_101743E9A6283FE0"/>and how ſoon you may be caſt in and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Eternity in the diſmal Vault of Hell you know not; is it not then of the laſt Neceſſity to try to eſcape for your Lives while there is any Hope, before your Feet ſtumble upon the dark Mountains, and you fall into the Gulf of irreparable Ruin. O! Is there no irreligious Chriſtleſs Perſon in this Aſſembly that is ready by this Time to cry out with the trembling Jaylor, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> I am now come to the Concluſion of this Diſcourſe, and what more ſhall I ſay to perſwade obſtinate periſhing Sinners to awake out of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Security and ſeek after God in good earneſt that they may eſcape the Wrath to come; I have ſhown you the Nature of that Repentance which you ought to ſet about with the utmoſt Application, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God for your Souls Salvation; I have ſhown you ſome of the ſtrong and weighty Reaſons and Arguments which the Great God urges upon you in his Word to perſwade you to it; the unreaſonable horrid Brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wilful Obſtinacy of your diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them and going on ſtill in your old Courſes; and the moſt awful terrible Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Miſeries which you are thereby ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelves into; and, O Sirs, will none of theſe Things move you!

               </gap> muſt be your Happineſs, that the everlaſting Intereſt of your immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls will not overballance it! Are you
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005132_0044_101743ECAF779C80"/>reſolv'd upon your own eternal Deſtruction? To ſell your deathleſs Souls to eternal Pains for a thing of nought? If any of you are brought to a Senſe of your miſerable periſhing Condition by a Life of Sin, and hearty Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to ſeek for Relief out of it, let me direct and beſeech you not to ſuffer theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to wear off and die away without ſaving Effects; but endeavour to apply theſe Things ſtill cloſely to your Hearts; take the eternal Concerns of your Souls into Solemn Conſideration, and abſtain from all your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Courſes of Sin and Negligence; cry, O cry earneſtly and often to the Great God for his pardoning Mercy in Chriſt, and renewing Grace that you may be entituled to and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his glorious Kingdom. And one Thing I would have you very particularly to take Notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> To conſider in all your Applications to God for your Salvation that if ever you are ſaved and received to Mercy it muſt be thro' the Merits and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt alone and nothing elſe. If you lay your Dependance and Hope for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Acceptance with God upon your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, Praying, and Repentance, you will eternally miſs of it: For this is acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the very Deſign of the Goſpel, and new Covenant-Way of Salvation. You are to obſerve and Practice theſe Things as the Means which God requires you to uſe to ſeek his Mercy and your own Salvation by: But if guilty Sinners hope by theſe Things, by their own filty Rags, and impure Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to encline the Love and Favour of God towards them, they may expect he will frown them into Hell for their Impudence: He has
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005132_0045_101743EFC4A6C008"/>eſtabliſhed another Method for their Relief which is more agreeable to his Wiſdom, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuited to the glorious Dignity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his Nature, and requires that they comply with it, humbly and thankfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their Salvation in that Way in which he is willing to give it. If ever God have Mercy upon you and be reconciled to you it will be for the perfect and pure Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own Son alone: The Merit and Righteouſneſs, the Obedience and Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be accepted for you; there is no other poſſible Way for your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>John</hi> 14.6. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. with many other Scriptures. And if ever you have a Share and Intereſt in his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mediation, and are brought into a State of Juſtification and Peace with God by it, you muſt cloſe with him by Faith, reject all Truſt and Confidence in any Thing elſe, fly to him alone for your Relief, lay the whole Weight of your Salvation upon his Merit and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and ſo take him with all your Heart for your only Saviour. And whoſoever do ſo come to Chriſt ſhall never be confounded; his faithful Word is engaged for it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O beg of God that he would give you true Faith to embrace the Redeemer, &amp; enable you to receive and cloſe with him in a right Manner. And know that there is a bleſſed and glorious Change wrought in a Sinners Heart, when by Faith he cloſes with Chriſt, as to the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Diſpoſitions, of it towards God; which likewiſe produces an anſwerable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the outward Practice and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. O ye ſecure impenitent Sinners awake awake out of your deep and deadly Sleep, out of your deluſive Dreams, before the burning
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005132_0046_101743F464DC1C88"/>Flames of Tophet kindle upon you and bring you to your Senſes, and fly to Chriſt that you may be ſaved. <hi>May the Lord bleſs theſe Thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
