            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014454_0012_0F928F70E81E91A0"/>
                  <hi>rightful authority</hi> over us, than the parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> or the divan of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And the grand argument in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this new doctrine is, that our <hi>charter</hi> is a <hi>compact</hi> between the king and our anceſtors, by which the <hi>ſole</hi> power of legiſlation is given forever to our general aſſembly. And in anſwer to this it is ſaid, that it never was in the <hi>power</hi> of the king to put any Britiſh ſubjects out of the juriſdiction of parliament, and therefore, if he had given ſuch a charter, it would be void; but it is ſaid further, that it is not true in fact; for that no ſuch grant of a ſupreme, independant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable power of legiſlation is, or ever was contained in the charter. Now, if ſuch a power he convey'd by the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is either <hi>expreſſed</hi> or <hi>implied</hi>—that it is not <hi>expreſſed</hi> is too clear to be deny'd—and therefore it muſt be <hi>implied,</hi> or it is not convey'd by the charter, but is merely imaginary. This is a queſtion of the higheſt importance to every man who has got a head, or any property to ſave or to loſe; for the principle, if wrong, leads directly to <hi>treaſon</hi> and <hi>rebellion</hi>; to which we are haſtening with a rapidity which, I greatly fear, will ſoon plunge us headlong in irretrievable ruin, unleſs we are ſtopt in our career. In order to a right underſtanding of this important matter, it is neceſſary to go back and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the caſe ſtood before, at, and everſince the time of our receiving the charter;—And from this view we ſhall alſo perceive whether the preſent claim of parliament is new, as many ignorantly ſuppoſe, or whether it was made, openly and expreſly, before the grant of the charter, and has ever ſince been uniformly exerciſed by them, and acknowledged by us. To ſatisfy myſelf in this matter, I have made a journey to Boſton, on purpoſe to ſee the ſtatutes at large; and I find the caſe to be thus. In 1650, an act of parliament was made for blocking up the ports of <hi>Barbados, Virginia, Bermudas</hi> and <hi>Antigua,</hi> in which the ſupreme authority of parliament over all the Colonies is moſt clearly and expreſly claimed, and it is declared "that they are, and ought to be, ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to, and dependant upon England; and have, ever ſince the planting thereof, been, and ought to be ſubject to ſuch laws, orders and regulations, as are, or ſhall be made by the parliament of England.—<hi>Any letters patent, or other authority formerly granted or given, to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>" This was during the protectorſhip of <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi>

               <p>In 1663, under the reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, was paſſed <hi>An act for the encouragement of trade</hi>—in which is this very remarkable clauſe—"And in regard his majeſty's plantations beyond the ſeas are inhabited and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by his <hi>ſubjects</hi> of this <hi>kingdom of England;</hi> for the maintaining a greater correſpondence and kindneſs between them, and keeping them in a <hi>firmer dependance</hi> upon it, and rendering them yet more beneficial and advantageous unto it, in the further employment and increaſe of Engliſh ſhipping and ſeamen, vent of Engliſh woollen and other manufactures and commodities, rendering the navigation to and from the ſame, more ſafe and cheap, and making this kingdom a ſtaple, not only of the commodities of thoſe plantations, but alſo of the commodities of other countries and places, for the ſupplying of them; and it being the uſage of other nations to keep their plantation-trade to themſelves:" &amp;c. Our charter was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in 1692, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers the general-court to make laws "ſo as the ſame be not repugnant or contrary to the laws of the realm of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land." And in 1696, during the ſame glorious reign, an act of parliament was made extending all the acts of trade to the Colonies, and requiring all governors and commanders in chief, "to take a ſolemn oath to do their utmoſt, that all the clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, matters and things contained in that and former acts of parliament, relating to the colonies and plantations be punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and <hi>bonâ fide</hi> obſerved." And it is therein expreſly enacted, "That all laws, by-laws, uſages and cuſtoms, at this time, or which hereafter ſhall be in practice, or endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or pretended to be in force or practice, in any of the ſaid plantations, which are in any wiſe repugnant to the before-mentioned laws or any of them, ſo far as they do relate to the ſaid plantations, or any of them, or which are any ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to this preſent act, or to any other law hereafter to be made in this kingdom, ſo far as ſuch law ſhall relate to and mention the ſaid plantations, are illegal, null and void to all intents and purpoſes whatſoever." Thus it appears that two and forty years before the grant of our charter, the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014454_0014_0F928F726C2F3010"/>
of parliament over us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was openly and explicitly claimed; and again, twenty nine years before; and then in the charter itſelf, this ſupreme juriſdiction is expreſly reſerved; and four years after it is again confirmed in the moſt poſitive terms, and all governors bound by an oath to ſee it ſubmitted to. Now, when we conſider this claim, openly and repeatedly made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at, and immediately after, the granting and accepting of the charter, if the charter can be view'd in the light of a <hi>compact,</hi> is not this evidently one eſſential article of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on our part, namely, that we will acknowledge and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the juriſdiction of parliament? It is plain we accepted the charter under this condition. How then can this, with the leaſt colour of truth, be called a <hi>new</hi> claim? Eſpecially, when this right of parliament, has not only been thus amply <hi>claimed,</hi> but has been all along <hi>exerciſed,</hi> in various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and without any oppoſition, denial or queſtion on our part—and this I find to be the caſe in fact—for, from the time of our charter, in every reign, acts of parliament have been continually making, impoſing duties, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the trade, manufactures and internal government and police of this and the other Colonies;—thus, duties have been impoſed and paid upon ſugar, rum, molaſſes, coffee, wines, &amp;c. and on the other hand, bounties and premiums have been granted on various articles; the trade of hatters, and the manufacture of iron, by flitting mills, has been regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and reſtrained—wool prohibited from being water-born —the poſt-office erected—the rates of coin eſtabliſhed—the cuting of pine trees prohibited—lands made liable to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of debts—the ſtatute of wills extended to the Colonies— the paper currency remained—in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of a compact as you ſeem to ſuppoſe, why I'm free to own, that I don't ſee ſo much reaſon to complain; but then how can that be? For I'm ſure Mr. ***** told the houſe, laſt ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as how the tea act was an ent'ring wedge, contrived by Lord <hi>North,</hi> to enſlave all the colonies, and Col. ******* ſaid as much. What is your opinion of the tea act, ſir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
               <p>My opinion is this. Before the late tea act was made, no tea could be ſhipped to America, unleſs the merchant firſt paid a duty of <hi>one ſhilling</hi> ſterling a pound; and this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was paid <hi>in England,</hi> and the merchant took the riſque of it's ever reaching America. This made tea ſo dear, that the Dutch could greatly underſell the Engliſh Eaſt India compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and the American merchants, at leaſt ſome of them, found their account in purchaſing tea of the Dutch, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it here; wherefore to enable the Engliſh to ſell as cheap as the Dutch, the parliament took off <hi>nine pence</hi> of the duty, and left only <hi>three pence;</hi> and this is not paid before the tea arrives ſafe here, but muſt be paid by the merchant before it is landed. And with the ſame view, they by another act, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Eaſt India company to ſell their tea by wholeſale, at public auction, in Boſton; by this means, if we did not fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly oppoſe it, inſtead of paying from a dollar to eight ſhillings a pound for tea, we might have it at two piſtareens, or half a dollar, at moſt.</p>

               <p>This is a mighty grievance truly; who would not fight rather than be deprived of the liberty of paying treble price for what they buy?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
               <p>But the grievance complain'd of lies here. This act laying the three-penny duty on tea, expreſly mentions, among other purpoſes, the <hi>raiſing a revenue:</hi> This, ſay we, is taking money out of our pockets without our conſent; and it is argued, that if they may do it in this trifling inſtance, they may do it in all others; and will go on till they leave us nothing. Upon which I would obſerve, in the firſt place, that it is not true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this is taking money out of our pockets without our conſent; becauſe we are not <hi>compell'd</hi> to buy; and if we <hi>will</hi> buy, the ſmall pittance which we pay for the duty, we pay with our own <hi>conſent,</hi> as much as we do any money which we pay for any commodity we buy. The ſame might as well be ſaid, when we buy a quart of rum, or a dram, for when we pay for it, we pay our proportion of the duty laid by act of parliament on molaſſes: This we have done a long time, and never found out that it was a <hi>grievance,</hi> or
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014454_0017_0F928F788A381E90"/>
that we were thereby made <hi>ſlaves</hi>—but the conſequence is falſe and abſurd; for it can never follow, that becauſe we ſubmit to a <hi>reaſonable</hi> law, therefore we muſt be call'd to ſubmit to the moſt <hi>tyrannical, unjuſt</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable</hi> laws. And what is the danger from this law, any more than from other reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue laws to which we have ſo long ſubmitted? Thoſe laws have all along, in fact, <hi>raiſed a revenue;</hi> and becauſe this is mentioned in the act, can this poſſibly alter the caſe? Yes, ſay our patriots, this is claiming a right to tax us; but I deny it; for as I have clearly ſhewn, this is no other claim than has been made, exerciſed and ſubmitted to, for more than a century: It is eſſentially different from <hi>taxing</hi> us; for a <hi>tax</hi> is raiſed by <hi>compulſion,</hi> whether we will or no; but this is a <hi>regulation</hi> of <hi>trade,</hi> by which, though it <hi>may</hi> raiſe a <hi>revenue,</hi> and is <hi>deſigned</hi> for this purpoſe, yet no man ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> be <hi>compell'd</hi> to pay any part of it; and if he does, it is his own voluntary act, as much as when he chooſes to drink wine or rum, rather than cyder, or to wear Engliſh cloth, rather than homeſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n; and they are doing no ſervice to their country, who thus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly place <hi>tax acts</hi> and <hi>revenue laws</hi> upon the ſame footing, and infer a right of <hi>taxation,</hi> from a right of <hi>legiſlation</hi> in other reſpects. But further, The tea act, as it is called, was made in the ſeventh year of the preſent reign; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, which I took a copy of, runs thus, "Whereas it is expedient that a <hi>revenue</hi> ſhould be raiſed in your Majeſty's dominions in America, for making a more certain and adequate proviſion for defraying the charge of the adminiſtration of juſtice, and the ſupport of civil government, in ſuch provinces where it ſhall be found neceſſary, and towards further defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expences of defending, protecting and ſecuring the ſaid dominions."—Now it is generally ſuppoſed, that this <hi>expreſs purpoſe of raiſing a revenue,</hi> in the Colonies, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely new and unprecedented; but to ſhow that this is a miſtake, I will read you a copy of the preamble to an act paſſed in the fourth year of this reign, which is thus, "Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is expedient that new proviſions and regulations ſhould be eſtabliſhed for improving the <hi>revenue</hi> of this kingdom, and for extending and ſecuring the navigation and commerce between Great-Britain and your Majeſty's dominions in America, which by the peace have been ſo happily enlarged: And whereas it is juſt and neceſſary that a <hi>revenue be raiſed</hi> in your Majeſty's ſaid dominions in America, for defraying the expences of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending protecting and ſecuring the ſame," &amp;c. and then the

act goes on to lay duties on ſugars, wines, Eaſt-India goods, &amp;c. imported from Great-Britain &amp;c. This act has been, and ſtill is, ſubmitted to, without the leaſt complaint. Now I ſhould be glad to know what difference there is between theſe two preambles, ſo far as reſpects the matter of <hi>raiſing a revenue.</hi>

               <p>Nay, ſo long ago ago as the year 1670. In an act made for regulating the plantation trade, one reaſon expreſly aſſign'd, is that otherwiſe "the trade of them would, in a great meaſure be diverted from England, and carried elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and his Majeſty's cuſtoms and <hi>revenues</hi> much <hi>leſſened.</hi>" In ſhort, every <hi>revenue act</hi> is, in the nature of it, <hi>an act</hi> for <hi>raiſing</hi> a <hi>revenue,</hi> whether it be ſo expreſs'd or not; and it is trifling at this time of day, to ſtart an objection, which does not carry the force even of a quibble. If it be ſaid that the money raiſed by this act is miſapplied, becauſe our civil offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are paid out of it; I anſwer, this is a diſtinct matter: The monies raiſed by this, and all other revenue acts, are, and, for more than a century, have been, paid into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's exchequer; and if when there, inſtead of being appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards eaſing Britiſh ſubjects in their taxes, as formerly, they are now applied for our eaſe, by paying the ſalaries of our governor, judges, &amp;c. which, otherwiſe, we muſt pay by an internal tax on our poles and eſtates, it ſeems as if we could have no reaſon to complain of this as a grievance: However, even though the money when raiſed was never ſo groſly <hi>miſapplied,</hi> it would by no means affect the legality and conſtitutional right of <hi>raiſing</hi> it; theſe are matters quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and independant of each other.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014454_0023_0F928F7CF4CC47F8"/>
is now confirm'd by parliament, and this is all—now it is plain, they are entitled to the enjoyment of their religion, according to the full extent and meaning of this agreement, or their country ought to be reſtored to them—and if the Engliſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment intended to comply with their terms of capitulation, ought they not to give them the fulleſt aſſurance of it, by confirming them by an act? Surely, if parliament is to be blamed for any thing, it ſhould ſeem to be rather, that they have not quieted the minds of the Canadians by giving them this aſſurance before—for we muſt remember that their religion is as dear to them, as ours is to us, and they have the ſame right to worſhip God, in the way they think right, that we claim for ourſelves—they have prejudices of education to bleſs them, as we have; and they have their own natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and their prieſts to guide them as we have; and they have an equal right with us to the benefit of the goſpel rule, "Do to others as ye would they ſhould do unto you". And we ſhould do well to remember that, "with what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we mete, it ſhall be meaſured unto us again.—In ſhort, the only principles upon which parliament can be arrainged in this inſtance, are entirely deſtructive of all liberty of conſcience; and in point of common juſtice, and the faith of nations, they can be found fault with, only upon the malevolent, unjuſt, diabolical poſition, which, God forbid Proteſtants ſhould ever adopt, that no faith is ever to be kept with hereticks.—As to the danger ariſing to our religion, from this act, it is a mere bugbear, raiſed to diſturb weak minds; for nothing can be more egregiouſly abſurd than to infer, that becauſe the king and parliament from the plain dictates of juſtice and humanity have comply'd with their moſt ſolemn treaty made by their general, and upon the faith of which, an extenſive country has been ſurrendered to them, that therefore the king intends to violate his coronation oath, and break thro' the condition upon which he holds his crown; and that the lords and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, collected from all parts of England, are joining in this impolitic, iniquitous, fooliſh deſign.—Let us turn the tables, and make the preſent caſe of the Canadians, our own.—Suppoſe the king of France had conquer'd New-England, at the time the king of England conquer'd Canada; and we had capitulated upon condition, that we ſhould enjoy our own religion, and chooſe our own miniſters, as we had done from the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the country to this time; and the French general had agreed to this, as general Amherſt did to their terms;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014454_0024_0F928F7E0D53A2E8"/>
and we had remained ever ſince under the French government; and when the king of France and his parliament had confirmed this treaty by a law; and the province of Canada ſhould make a clamour, and ſay the king of France, being governed by his miſtreſſes, intended to introduce the Proteſtant religion among them: I aſk every unprejudiced man, whether he would not think, and ſay, the Canadians were the moſt jealous, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and unjuſt people under heaven?—I will venture to anſwer, yes, for every Engliſhman upon the continent—and are our clamours leſs unreaſonable than theirs would be under ſimilar circumſtances? Certainly with what judgment we ſhould judge them, we ought to be judged—but further, whence ariſes the mighty danger? The act of parliament grants no new liberty; it only confirms what they have enjoy'd for eleven or twelve years, ſince the conqueſt, and for a century before; and has Popery ſpread or prevail'd in any degree in the other Colonies, during that time—or has our religion ſuffered from the prevalency of that of the Roman catholics in <hi>Virginia,</hi> for many years paſt—ſurely people muſt feel but little of the power and influence of their religion, who fear any danger ariſing to it, from the bare <hi>toleration</hi> of any <hi>other religion</hi> in any <hi>other part</hi> of the globe. In ſhort, it is plain, beyond a poſſibility of doubt, that this innocent and juſt act of parliament is gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily catch'd at, by your deceivers, as a lucky prop to a cauſe which has no foundation, but in deluſion; and conſequently, is in danger of falling every moment—they have perſuaded you that the two grand objects for which men in ſociety, will fight, if they ever fight, are now at ſtake, viz. <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>property.</hi>
