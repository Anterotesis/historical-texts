            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>DETECTION OF A CONSPIRACY, FORMED BY THE <hi>UNITED IRISHMEN.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I HAVE long thought, that the French have form<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed a regular plan for organizing an active and effective force within theſe States; and I am perſuaded, that after what I am now going to lay before the public ſhall have been read with attention, few people will be ſo blind as not to perceive, that my opinion was well founded. The Pariſian Propagande have, in every country that they wiſhed to ruin, found villains in abundance ready to engage in their ſervice. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious they have allured by the proſpect of power, and the needy by that of pillage. In America there is leſs ambition and leſs poverty than in moſt other countries, and therefore, though ſome traitors have been found amongſt them, the <hi>natives</hi> were not much to be relied on, in the proſecution of any deſign, evidently hoſtile to the intereſts and honour of their country. They might be deceived, they might be duped to lend their aid indirectly to ſome ſuch deſign; but no man, who
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:048395_0003_10250641DA415BF8"/>
is led on in the dark, can be ſafely confided in; becauſe, at the firſt dawn of light, it is a thouſand to one but he makes his retreat.</p>
            <p>The French ſeem to have been fully aware of this. Indeed, they learnt this truth from the mortifying defection of the AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES. There were many well-meaning men, who became members of theſe ſeditious meetings from ignorance, and who diſcovered no inconſiderable zeal in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating their principles; but, the bandage was torn from their eyes, and no ſooner did they perceive the real views of DALLAS and the other leaders, than they turned their backs on them with deteſtation.</p>
            <p>This leſſon induced the French to exert their <hi>"diplomatic ſkill'</hi> in chooſing inſtruments more fit for their purpoſe. Ignorance when allied with honeſty was no tool for them to work with. Real, ſincere, villainy, then without property, without principles, without country and without character; dark and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, unnatural and bloody-thirſty ruffins; theſe were what they wanted; and where could they have ſought them with ſuch certainty of ſucceſs, as amongſt that reſtleſs rebellious tribe, the emigrated UNITED IRISHMEN? The wretches known by this name, had eſcaped from their country to avoid a puniſhment juſtly due to their multitude of crimes. <hi>Here</hi> they expected to find an organized ſyſtem of perpetual anarchy: the needy anticipated a life of lazineſs and plunder, the ambitious thought to graſp on power already moulded
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:048395_0004_10250645A262CBA0"/>
to their hands; they all counted upon a ſtate of things, congenial to their own wicked diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>Happily for us, they were deceived. They found a government, which, if too weak (like their own) to puniſh conſpirators according to their deſerts, was yet too ſturdy to fall proſtrate at their feet. They found property protected from their fraternizing clutches; they ſaw their hopes of political conſequence vaniſh like a dream; and, inſtead of careſſes, condolence and applauſe, from the people, they meet with the ſame virtuous abhorrence that had followed them from the ſhores of their native land.</p>
            <p>Thus diſappointed, thus mortified, thus humbled and diſgraced, it was not to be wondered at, that they conceived a hatred againſt America equal to that which they entertained agaiſt their own country, and it is ſtill leſs to be wondered at, that they enrolled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the treacherous ſervice of France.</p>
            <p>The firſt I heard of the exiſtence of a Society of United Iriſhmen <hi>here,</hi> was by a printed paper (a copy of which the reader will ſee by-and-bye dated the 18th December laſt, and ſigned Js. REYNOLDS. It was envelloped in a piece of paper addreſſed to me, and was left by an unknown hand, at the houſe of a perſon in Market-ſtreet. It was on the 16th of January that I received this paper, and in about three weeks afterwards, the <hi>plan</hi> of the conſpiracy was conveyed to me through the ſame channel.</p>
            <p>This <hi>plan,</hi> which is called a <hi>conſtitution,</hi> is printed in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:048395_0005_1025064733B84BA0"/>
a ſmall octavo pamphlet, bearing date the 8th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt laſt. The imprint imports, that it was printed at Philadelphia, for the ſociety; but the <hi>printer's name</hi> is very cautiouſly omitted. The perſon who encloſed me the pamphlet, has, indeed, written in the margin the name of a printer, who, from the villainous publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which have come from his preſs, I make no doubt was really the man; but this evidence is too weak for me to proceed upon in publiſhing his name to the world, as guilty of an offence, which amount to treaſon againſt the United States.—Here follows the <hi>plan</hi> of the <hi>conſpiracy.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Our love for freedom has not been leſſened by what we have experienced of its effects, or for Ireland by our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

Under the ſacred influence of devotion to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, EQUALITY AND LIBERTY of ALL men, we gladly embrace the ſolemn ties by which we wiſh to be bound to one another, and hereby form ourſelves into an aſſociation,</hi>

                  <p>[The declared intention of procuring <q>equality and liberty to ALL men,</q> is a clear proof Ireland alone was not in their view. But, as we go on, we ſhall perceive that neither that country nor its concerns are at all included in the objects of theſe people. The words <hi>Ireland, Iriſhmen,</hi> &amp;c. are mere ſubſtitutes for other words, like the cant of the pick-pockets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which a <hi>hog</hi> means a <hi>ſhilling,</hi> a <hi>pig</hi> means a <hi>ſixpence,</hi> and ſo on. This will clearly appear from the articles and TEST of the precious conſtitution.]</p>

                  <p>[Thus, you ſee, it is not IRISHMEN alone, who are eligible to this Society; but ALL SUCH PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SONS as ſhall, according to their cant, have <hi>ſuffered in the cauſe of freedom,</hi> or have ſhown their zeal for <hi>the

What had any of theſe people to do with <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> But, on the abſurdity of this we ſhall have time to remark by-and-by. Indeed, the TEST itſelf gives the lie to this cant about Ireland. All that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to remak on this ſection, is, <hi>that it provides for the admiſſion of every diſcontented, factious man in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States:</hi> and that the latter part of it is no more than a copy of the qualification clauſe of the Jacobin Club at Paris, except that the latter required poſitive proof from every new member of his having <hi>actually committed ſome crime deſerving the halter,</hi> while our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral conſpirators, thinking it unjuſt to exclude a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain merely becauſe he has failled of ſucceſs, are willing, in ſome caſes, to admit the <hi>intention</hi> as equal in merit to the deed.]</p>

                     <hi>Section</hi> 8. That the TEST of this Society, the INTENTION of this INSTITUTION, (in all other reſpects than as a <hi>ſocial body,</hi> attached to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,) be conſidered as SECRET AND INVIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LABLE in all caſes, but between members, and in the body of the Society.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Section</hi> 9. That nevertheleſs, a member of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſhall not be conſidered as divulging its ſecrets, who ſhall propound to perſons diſpoſed to become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the ſenſe of the ſix propoſitions which <hi>precede the teſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[Here we ſee that Ireland is almoſt dropped out of ſight. It is juſt mentioned in order to introduce the Britiſh government; but the initiated is to ſwear, that he will do the utmoſt of his power for the attainment of LIBERTY and EQUALITY, to MANKIND; and, theſe efforts does he ſwear to make, IN WHAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EVER NATION HE MAY RESIDE! Ireland, therefore, if not totally diſmiſſed by the TEST, is no more contemplated by it than America is, taking the words in their literal ſenſe: and we ſhall ſee in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, that this bleſſed liberty and equality is entended for America alone.</p>
                  <p>The crimality of the purpoſe and end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:048395_0010_1025065469B09798"/>
is moſt amply proved by the ſection that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows the TEST.—<q>The TEST of this ſociety and the INTENTION of the inſtitution ſhall be kept SECRET and INVIOLABLE.</q>— The members may tell the world that it is a <q>
                        <hi>ſocial body,</hi> attached to freedom;</q> that is, they may give out that its principles are friendly to general liberty; they may repreſent it as one of thoſe collections of individuals that men of ſenſe uſually laugh at, but they muſt not ſay a word about the INTENTION of the inſtitution, nor muſt they diſcover the nature of the OATH.</p>
                  <p>Now, if nothing more were meant than an aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt <hi>the government of Great Britain,</hi> which they muſt well know would excite contempt and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, why all this <hi>ſecrecy?</hi> Why conceal the nature of the oath? and, particularly, why conceal the <hi>intention</hi> of the inſtitution?</p>
                  <p>By the 9th Section we ſee, that the diſcoveries, made even to thoſe who offer themſelves as members, are to extend no further than "the ſenſe of the ſix propoſitions <hi>preceding</hi> the TEST." The Teſt itſelf they are to know nothing of, 'till they have gone too far to retreat, and then they are bound not to divulge what they have learnt. Firſt the initiated member ſwears, that he <q>will never, from <hi>fear of puniſhment,</hi> or <hi>hope of reward,</hi> divulge any of the <hi>ſecrets,</hi> given to him as ſuch?</q> and then the INTENTION of the inſtitution is immediately given to him as one of thoſe <hi>inviolable ſecrets!</hi> If there were nothing wicked,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:048395_0011_10250656F9B0E7D8"/>
nothing highly criminal, nothing dark and traiterous in this INTENTION, why is the diſcovery of it thus guarded againſt? Men never <hi>"fear puniſhment"</hi> for concealing what is not criminal. Indeed, this TEST ſtamps the character of the combination: a Teſt of ſecrecy, as to the <hi>motives</hi> of the members, is eſſential to a conſpiracy; and it is that which diſtinguiſhes this ſociety from <hi>"a ſocial body,"</hi> which is the character they wiſh to appear under in the eyes of the world.</p>
                  <p>Here again we perceive the plan to be little more than a copy of that of the Jacobin club in France. The <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is diſcarded, and the initiated wretch ſwears by the "SUPREME BEING." Next <hi>Liberty and Equality to mankind</hi> is the object, <hi>in whatever country they may reſide;</hi> the world are to be told, that the ſociety is merely a <hi>ſocial body;</hi> but its real INTENTION is to be kept a ſecret under the moſt ſolemn injunctions. Thus proceeded the Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins at Paris, that <hi>ſocial body</hi> who overturned the government of France. PLAYFAIR ſays, they had <hi>two creeds,</hi> one to <hi>amuſe the public,</hi> and another that, for long time, never was known but to the members.</p>
                  <p>The oath of ſecrecy neceſſarily forbids a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of one of the pamphlets containing the TEST, &amp;c. the perſon who made this communication to me muſt, therefore, have broken his oath, or muſt have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loined the pamphlet. I rather think the former; becauſe had he not thus committed himſelf; were it not that he was aſhamed to own himſelf one of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:048395_0012_102506589A5C7D48"/>
conſpirators, and at the ſame time, incurred the odium of having betrayed his companions, it is pretty clear' that poſſeſſing an inclination to make the diſcovery' he would long ago have come forward as the inſtrument of an effectual proſecution. He tells me in a note which covered one of the papers, that he has <hi>found a clue</hi> to all their ſecrets, and, as I before obſerved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he writes down the name of the printer in the margin. This latter circumſtance was enough; for, if the printing could be proved, or if it can be proved now, the printer at leaſt, can be puniſhed as a conſpirator, and this may lead to a diſcovery of his employers.</p>
                  <p>Having thus remarked on the deſign of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, I ſhould now come to the means provided for <hi>inſuring its ſucceſs,</hi> by which the reader will at leaſt ſee the extent of the plan, and will be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that its real object is the deſtruction of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Government.]</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Section</hi> 11.

the three next ſucceeding meetings thereof, and if his arrears be not paid on the third reading, he ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Society. But excluded members, upon paying all arrears due, and the uſual contributions that were payable during his excluſion, may apply for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, agreeable to the uſual form, Provided, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, that this rule ſhall not extend to ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as ſhall declare their inability to pay, in reply to the ſecretary, in an authentic form, and where local circumſtances may render their attendance impoſſible, or highly inconvenient.</p>

                        <hi>Section</hi> 14. That when the State Committees, or the General Executive Committee, or a majority of the ſections recommend a reviſion of the preceding conſtitution, it ſhall take place.</p>
                     <p>[Now, leaving the mere formalities and other tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling things aſide, let us take this plan and look at it in its ſubſtance. It is very properly called an <hi>"en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged organization,"</hi> for it embraces an extent no leſs than that of the whole Union.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, we ſee, that every reſtleſs wretch, of whatever nation, is admitted into any ſection of the ſociety,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:048395_0018_102506694FC59900"/>
and has his name, place of reſidence, &amp;c. enrolled on its liſt; but, leſt the aſſemblages ſhould become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldly, or alarming to the magiſtrates, theſe ſections when they get to a certain ſtrength, ſeparate, and the detached parts form new ones, juſt as bees ſwarm when the hive is over-crowded — The troops being thus enrolled in the ſections, the next thing is to render them manageable. Were the ſections ſubjected to no ſuperior command; were they to remain ſcattered over the country without any common head, they would be like ſo many independent companies without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. But, theſe troops have not been raiſed to <hi>lie in idleneſs,</hi> and, therefore, a mode of uniting their efforts is provided. The ſections in every ſtate are to ſend delegates to form a <hi>State-Committee;</hi> and theſe ſixteen State-Committees are to ſend delegates to form a <hi>"General EXECUTIVE Committee;"</hi> and this is the whole brought to one point.</p>
                     <p>So much for the organization. Now for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative part of the plan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"The General</hi> EXECUTIVE <hi>Committee"</hi> (which, I have not the leaſt doubt, is now ſitting in Philadelphia) keeps up a conſtant communication with the State-Committees, and from it, the whole Society, or rather <hi>army,</hi> receives "directions" when and how to act. It has returns made to it of the numbers enrolled in each State, of the names, reſidence, and occupation, of the perſons enrolled; by this mean it is at all times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of its ſtrength, and of where that ſtrength lies.</p>

                            rendition="simple:additions"/>When it is neceſſary TO ACT, the General <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive</hi> Committee are to diſpatch their orders to the State Committees; theſe to their ſections, and theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain (by their committee of <hi>ſecrecy</hi>) to their <hi>ſub-ſections.</hi> Here the orders reach the <hi>active troops,</hi> and that there may be no confuſion in their movements, theſe <hi>ſub-ſections</hi> conſiſt of only <hi>eight</hi> men each, all <hi>living near one another,</hi> and one of theſe eight is a ſort of non-commiſſion officer, who (to uſe the very words of the conſpirators) is to "have the <hi>charge</hi> of the other ſeven, and is to WARN them IN CASES OF UR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENCY"!!!</p>
                     <p>Now, I appeal to any man of common ſenſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this infernal combination can poſſibly have any other object in view than an inſurrection againſt the government of America. What <hi>"caſes of urgency"</hi> can ariſe <hi>in this country,</hi> what opportunity can offer it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>here,</hi> for <hi>overturning the Britiſh Government in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Were the villains, indeed furniſhed with <hi>wings;</hi> could they like other birds of paſſage, aſſemble in a flock and take their flight to Ireland; then the oſtenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motive of the aſſociation would have ſomething like plauſibility about it; but, as they are, this oſtenſible motive is a palpable abſurdity, a mere trick which has been invented in order to inveigh ignorant perſons to take the TEST, and, in caſe of detection, to avoid the puniſhment which the law awards to <hi>traitors</hi> and <hi>ſpies;</hi> or at leaſt, to leave room for doubt and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the courts of juſtice; a bad chance being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

than none, and ten years impriſonment being better than death.</p>
                     <p>That this conſpiracy is intended <hi>to aid the cauſe of France,</hi> it is hardly neceſſary to inſiſt on; every one muſt perceive it at the firſt glance.—What can theſe ragged ruſſians expect to do <hi>alone?</hi> How can they alone ſupport their current expences, excluſive of <hi>"caſes of urgency,"</hi> of arms, ammunition, &amp;c. &amp;c. By an attention to the financical part of their plan, you will perceive, that the money they collect from the members is barely ſufficient to defray the charges which muſt neceſſarily be incurred for rooms to meet in. Who is to pay for printing their CONSTITUTIONS, their CERTIFICATES (which I hear is from an engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved copper plate); who is to pay for the time and travelling expences of all their Delegates from the Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the State Committees, and from them to the General Executive Committee at Philadelphia; who is to pay a ſum amounting to not leſs than <hi>forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars</hi> annually? Who but thoſe who boaſt of their "Diplomatick Skill," <hi>and of their</hi> 
                        <q>powerful faction in this country;</q> thoſe who have long had in pay the leading <hi>patriots</hi> in Ireland, and who have conſtantly ſupported a hireling preſs in each of the principal Cities of America?</p>
                     <p>Next, obſerve that the cloſeſt intimacy exiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſans-culotte French, who are here, the moſt diſtinguiſhed of the emigrated United Iriſhmen, and a baſe American printer, notoriouſly in the ſervice of France. Obſerve too, that NAPPER TANDY

went from New York to France, and that the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, as appears by its date, was not formed, 'till <hi>after we heard of his arrival at Paris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The leaders in this conſpiracy are the very ſame perſons, who conducted that in Ireland. When a ſection of their deluded partizans, in that country, were taken unawares by the King's troops, no money but <hi>French</hi> was found upon them, and this in a retired part of the kingdom, where it was impoſſible theſe inſatuated wretches could have come at it through any other channel than that of the deſpots of Paris and their wicked agents. And, if a conſpiracy could be ſo effectually paid there, in a country at open war with France, with an <hi>alien law,</hi> vigourouſly enforced, how eaſy muſt it be for them to maintain a hired and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly paid conſpiracy here, when there is no check whatſoever to their machinations!</p>
                     <p>This diabolical plan was formed on the 8th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt laſt, immediately before the YELLOW FEVER commenced its ravages in this city; with this in his recollection the reader will form his opinion reſpecting the following, which is a copy of the <hi>printed paper,</hi> before mentioned.</p>

                     <p>This notice, I would have the reader believe, I have not publiſhed without good proof of its being ſigned by REYNOLDS, the ſeeker of "REPOSE." His name is <hi>written,</hi> and the hand writing has not only been carefully compared with the ſignature to a letter of his, now in my poſſeſſion; but has alſo been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and verified before one of the judges in this city. All that is now wanted is, good proof of the perſon who <hi>printed,</hi> or who <hi>authorized printing,</hi> the plan of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, which is called the CONSTITUTION, and if any American, <hi>native</hi> or <hi>adopted,</hi> is in poſſeſſion of the means of producing ſuch proof, and neglects to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, he is to all intents and purpoſes a TRAITOR.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall, now, briefly ſtate, what I have lately gathered reſpecting the members of which the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy now conſiſts, and reſpecting the manner in which they are to ACT, and on what occaſions. In the mean time, I would have THOSE, in whoſe power alone it is to counteract the baleful effects of this helliſh combination, to recollect, that any ALIEN LAW, which extends only to ALIENS of a <hi>nation committing hoſtilities on the United States,</hi> will not reach the members of this affiliation.</p>
                     <p>I am informed, by one of the perſons who manage the affairs of the AFRICAN SCHOOL, that the United Iriſhmen have not aſſembled there, for ſome time paſt, and that the reaſon of this was, their number was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="unknown:048395_0024_10253B7D01BB1998"/>
                        <hi>too great</hi> for ſo ſmall a room. I am alſo well informed, that two <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> have been admitted into the Society (I dare ſay there are two hundred, and that they earneſtly ſolicited <hi>another Engliſhman</hi> to join it. Their ſtrength, at this time, in this city and twenty miles round, conſiſts of above <hi>fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred;</hi> no contemptible number, if we conſider how ſhort the ſpace is, ſince they began to enliſt. A <hi>ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> has been formed at New-York, another at Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and another is either formed, or about to be formed, at Chamberſburgh, in this ſtate. Indeed, there is very little doubt, but we ſhall very ſoon receive ſatisfactory information of their being organized in every ſtate, and in every principal city and town in the Union.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to their calling their troops into <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſervice,</hi> it is clear that they would proceed in the ſame manner as the Jacobins in every other country have done. Conſpirators are always cowards: beſides this, they know too well their weakneſs to attempt an attack on the Government, unaided by any other party, and unprotected by a foreign power. Their whole buſineſs therefore, at preſent, is, to organize themſelves; to enliſt and number their troops, and to lie in wait for what they very properly call, <hi>"caſes of URGENCY."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the <hi>"diplomatic ſkill"</hi> of France had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with ſuch complete ſucceſs as the tyrants of that wretched country ſuppoſed it was; if it had been found, upon trial, that ſhe poſſeſſed a very numerous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable faction here entirely devoted to her orders, theſe <hi>"caſes of URGENCY"</hi> might have ariſen
<pb facs="unknown:048395_0025_1025067A59722130"/>
from internal commotions. This ſource now ſeems to be dried up. The diſpatches from France have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the "Siſter Republic" of all her adherents, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the moſt abandoned and infamous miſcreants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Americans, her own ſans-culottes, and the half-gibbeted democrats from Great Britain and Ireland. Nothing, then, can give riſe to one of thoſe <q>caſes of URGENCY</q> ſhort of an invaſion by France either from the Spaniſh territory, or from the ſea; and, for an event of this kind the conſpirators are ooking for with hopes much more ſanguine than wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſeed of Abraham ever looked for the coming of the Meſſiah.</p>
                     <p>An invaſion on the coaſt is a thing naturally to be expected, unleſs an alliance is formed with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: from Louſiana or the Floridas is to be expected, whether ſuch an alliance takes place or no. This, then, would be the <hi>"caſe of URGENCY,"</hi> and thus the conſpirators would act. Before the panic would be over, (for there are your panic people in all countries) the whole affiliation would be in movement. They would thwart, threaten, or collect mobs; openly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or ſecretly betray, juſt as it ſuited their ſeveral ſituations. They are not viſible now, but then they would be ſeen and felt too. I make no doubt but they have members, in ſome capacity or other, in every public department. I ſhould not wonder if they had at this time fifty in the different branches of the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>office. Thus has it proved in every country, which the infamous ſans-culottes have invaded with ſucceſs. In Holland, for inſtance, few people feared the invaders. The barriers were well fortified, well garriſoned, we ſupplied with ammunition and proviſions, and the people appeared <hi>unanimous</hi> in their hatred of the enemy. But the fortreſſes fell, nobody could tell how; the French arrived as if it were <hi>by appointment,</hi> and many of thoſe who had been the loudeſt in their expreſſions againſt them, were the firſt that they took by the hand.
<pb facs="unknown:048395_0026_1025067CEBB26AA8"/>
Theſe villains had held a correſpondence with them, and afterwards made a boaſt of their treaſon; the ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin affiliation ran through all the United Provinces; its members had crept into every department, civil and military; the mine was completed, and, at the approach of the enemy it was ſprung. Juſt ſo was it in Italy, in Geneva, in Venice; ſo was it in Switzerland; ſo will it be in Spain, and would it have been in Britain long ago, had it not been for her inſular ſituation and the watchfulneſs and vigour of her government.</p>
                     <p>To the danger of ſuch a conſpiracy America is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly expoſed. Her <hi>diſtance from France</hi> is often, and, I muſt add, very ſtupidly, held out as a guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee for her ſafety. I might inſiſt that there is no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier between her and the Spaniſh territory, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body would deny; but, waving that, what, without the interference of Great Britain, is there to prevent twenty thouſand ſans-culottes from landing in this country? And, if they ſhould do this, how many circumſtances has America againſt her which no ſtate in Europe knew any thing of!</p>
                     <p>From various cauſes theſe United States have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the reſting place of ninety nine hundredths of the factions villains, which Great Britain and Ireland have vomitted from their ſhores. They are all ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſedition, are adepts at their trade, and they moſt certainly bear as cordial a hatred to this government as they did to their own. The French ſans-culottes now here, capable of bearing arms, amount to at leaſt thirty thouſand, all furious ruffians, puffed up with vanity, ſtarving with hunger, and ſighing for conqueſt and pillage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="unknown:048395_0027_1025067E7AF615F0"/>Great numbers of theſe wretches, of all countries, are what are called CITIZENS; ſo that no <hi>alien law</hi> will touch them. Several hundreds of French have very lately been admitted to this deſtructive privilege and it is well known, that REYNOLDS is not only a citizen, but the <hi>political father</hi> of other citizens; for he has been ſuffered to vouch for their "good moral character and <hi>their attachment to "Conſtitution,"</hi> a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary prelude to their admiſſion. The penal code has been ſoftened down, till it has no terrors, except for the honeſt man, who ſtands in need of <hi>protection.</hi> There are ſixteen governments, all in ſome meaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the general government, to whom the ſafety of the nation is committed, and theſe ſixteen are very far from being all in the hands of ſuch men as would lend their cordial ſupport to that general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The villain, who would get his neck ſtretched in the Federal courts, would very probably eſcape through other hands. In ſuch a ſtate of things the civil magiſtrate muſt hold a blunted, if not a broken, ſword; and as to the military, though I would be willing to ſtake every thing on their <hi>valour,</hi> yet valour alone without ſkilful commanders and ſoldier well diſciplined, is like a razor in the hands of a child.</p>
                     <p>But, what renders the ſituation of America more favourable to the views of France than any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is, the <hi>negro ſlavery</hi> to the Southward. On this it is that the villains ground their hope. It is ſaid that ſome of the <hi>free</hi> negroes have already been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the conſpiracy of the UNITED IRISHMEN, and that ſome ſlave holders either in Carolina or Virginia have engaged, in <hi>"a caſe of URGENCY,"</hi> to ſet their negroes free, in order to excite diſcontents amongſt
<pb facs="unknown:048395_0028_102506800FEDAAD0"
                            rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe of their neighbours, and thus involve the whole country in rebellion and bloodſhed. I do not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to ſay that theſe preparatory ſteps have been taken, but this I know, that nothing could be thought more helliſh or better calculated to inſure ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of people who will <hi>ſmile</hi> at all this, and will call it a mere bug bear: theſe are, the muddy-headed men of indifference and the jacobins themſelves. But, I truſt the real friends of government will ſee it in its true light, and will not ſuffer themſelves to be lulled aſleep by the ſongs of Doctor "REPOSE" and his adherents. All theſe people want for the preſent is, to ſee the government <hi>quiet,</hi> dull, and unſuſpecting. This is what they wiſhed in Britain and Ireland. Every precautionary meaſure of the legiſlature or the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; every <hi>inquiry,</hi> however legal, and however deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately conducted, they brand with the name of "jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous tyranny;" and to every honeſt man, who has the zeal to come forward in the diſcovery of their infernal plots, they give the appellation of SPY. This has had much influence on weak minds. Your <hi>good-natured peaceable</hi> man cannot bear the name of <hi>ſpy</hi> or <hi>informer;</hi> he would ſooner ſee his neighbours burnt in their beds, and his own wife and children along them. I hope, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that there is yet good ſenſe and ſpirit enough leſs amongſt us to deſpiſe every thing theſe artful treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous villains can ſay, and to defeat every thing they ſhall attempt. The man, who ſhall bring the leaders of this conſpiracy to the halter, will deſerve as well of his country as thoſe who ſhall ſhed their blood in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
