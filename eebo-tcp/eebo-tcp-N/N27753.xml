            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the familiar courſe of human events we are apt to be regardleſs of the hand of God, in the uſual operations of nature, and in all the ordinary inſtances of mortality which are preſented before our eyes.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt that, upon due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the one of theſe would be interpreted into clear indications of an over-ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the other improved into impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and affecting memento's of human frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Through the familiarity of both, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we are ſufficiently attentive to neither.</p>
            <p>But when the Sepreme Ruler of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe makes bare his arm by ſome ſignal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his power, his ſovereignty, or his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, when he viſits a city with ſome deadly contagion, or removes from amongſt us ſuch of our fellow men as were eminently virtuous and uſeful, who had engroſſed our affections, and on whoſe preſervation our intereſts mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036983_0004_100C3317F8E82550"/>
depended; when he makes the Godly man to ceaſe, and the faithful man to fail, he rouſes by ſuch high diſpenſations the attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all his creatures, and cauſes them to mourn under the afflictive viſitations of his rod.</p>
            <p>Impreſſed by ſuch circumſtances with a ſenſe of our weakneſs and dependence, and affected by the occurrence of ſuch ſorrowful events, we are brought to perform the duty, and exerciſe the privilege of nature, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves more immediately under the guardian care of Heaven, and flying for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to the throne of grace. Hence the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate application of the Pſalmiſt in the words of the text.</p>
            <p>Who was the particular ſubject of his plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtrains, it is not material that I ſhould now ſtay to enquire. They are applicable to the caſe of all good men; for their lives are more or leſs important to the peace and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of this world.</p>
            <p>On the preſent occaſion we underſtand their application, alas! too well. Never did a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple meet with ſo great a loſs as that which we deplore. Never was there before ſo loud a call for earneſt ſupplication to the Father of Mercies. Never had the people of America ſuch cauſe of funeral grief as that which has brought us together to-day. The Godly man hath ceaſed, and the faithful hath failed:— The beloved WASHINGTON is no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:036983_0005_100C32FF49AEBE98"/>Often do we behold the ſorrows of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted parent, the diſconſalate widow, or the helpleſs orphan; but in this ſad inſtance all America is become a houſe of mourning, and ſignals of diſtreſs appear on every ſide. The melancholy tidings of his death have deeply afflicted all diſcriptions of perſons. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſire, and tender matron bow down the hoary head in penſive ſorrow; and the cheek of the ingenious youth is bedewed with tears. In this numerous aſſembly I ſee ſadneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picted in every countenance.</p>
            <p>On this memorable day the whole repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people of his native State, by whoſe appointment theſe funeral honours are paid, appear in the ſable badge of mourning in teſtimony of their grief for the loſs of this illuſtrious, faithful man; and every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al citizen ſympathizes in reſponſive ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder; he was the "Hero of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the father of his country, the firſt of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, and the friend of man."<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>NOTE.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Madiſons eulogium in the Aſſembly.</p>
               </note> Great is the worth of men of piety and virtue to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; but when theſe are found to adorn conſpicuous &amp; important ſtations, it is wholly incalculable. The Godly and the faithful man is not only the moſt reſpectable in his private character—he is not only an honor to the ſtate that gave him birth, and to the race
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036983_0006_100C33016F405040"/>
from which he ſprang, but he is the brighteſt ornament, and the moſt extenſive benefactor to the world at large.</p>
            <p>Virtue is not only neceſſary to the peace and happineſs of private life, but it is that alone by which a nation can riſe to greatneſs, or enjoy any laſting proſperity.</p>
            <p>This, in a greater or leſs degree, is true of all nations; but to thoſe which, like ours, are bleſſed with free republican forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which virtue is the leading princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, it is of ſtill the greater uſefulneſs, and the more indiſpenſible neceſſity. It not only reflects upon them their greateſt luſtre, but is, in truth, their only ſure defence.</p>
            <p>When vice and licentiouſneſs, by an injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious choice, or any unfortunate accident, are advanced to important and influential ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of honors, of profit, or of power, they do not confine themſelves within the immediate circle of the court, but they diffuſe their bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence all around, and gradually pervade and corrupt all parts of the community. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the practice, inſtead of being ſuppreſſed by the influence of thoſe who are in authority, they ſtalk abroad with hardy front, until finally they triumph over the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, the dignity, the liberties, nay, the very exiſtance of the people. Hence the ſaying of the wiſe man in the Proverbs; "when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn."</p>
            <p>In contraſt with this, let us view the Godly
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036983_0007_100C3303F226AB38"/>
and the faithful man, in a like ſituation, and learn hence to eſtimate the infinite ſuperiority of his character, and his worth to ſociety.</p>
            <p>Walking in the "paths of truth and grace" he is not only himſelf a moſt dignified and venerable character, but becomes to others a pattern worthy of all imitation. He exhibits virtue in its native comelineſs and purity, and from the eminence of his ſtation he ſpreads a glory around it. He recommends religion by his example: He reſtrains vice by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. That prevails and rejoices under the patronage of his ſmiles—this flies from his preſence, or ſhrinks at his approach with all the puſillanimity of conſcious guilt. "When the righteous man is exalted the people rejoice." In him virtue is perſonified as their repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and to him their intereſts, as far as this is neceſſary, are chearfully entruſted. The amiable excellence of his character acquires their confidence, and his entegrity renders the depoſit ſafe.</p>
            <p>Surely the death of ſuch a man is juſtly to be regretted as a great public loſs; and with affecting propriety has it been made the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Pſalmiſt's lamentations in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage before us. Such a man, my Brethren, was the dear friend whom we have loſt.</p>
            <p>He was well tried: he was thoroughly proved by his country in a long and variegat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life. He always held himſelf ready to obey it's call on any emergency, and he ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his truſt with the utmoſt fidelity. He
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036983_0008_100C33057AC78BE0"/>
entered into it's ſervice in the prime of his life, and he continued in it, with but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, to the day of his death.</p>
            <p>In every ſtation which this great man fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led—in every ſphere of life in which he was appointed to move, I might call upon our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens from one end of the continent to the other, and with tears of gratitude they would all bear teſtimony that he invariably exhibited the evidence, and maintained the character of a "Godly and a faithful man."</p>
            <p>As long as the people of America ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue bleſſed with the enjoyment of peace, of liberty and independence, it will not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that next to a kind and gracious God, who always made this country his care, they are greatly indebted for them, to the manly firmneſs, the unremitted exertions, and the inviolable fidelity of GEORGE WASHINGTON<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Raiſed up by Divine Providence to defend the liberties and vindicate the rights of his country, he nobly ſtepped forward in the day of her diſtreſs, when oppreſſed by foreign do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and bleeding from the wounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by an invading army; and againſt a formidable hoſt, led on her little band of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots. Then did his mighty ſoul, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brooked oppreſſion, exert its energy. A ſincere lover of liberty, and "early accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appreciate its value," he exchanged the eaſe of domeſtic retirement for the field of battle, and fought valiantly for the people and for "the cities of his God." Nor from this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036983_0009_100C3307AE450050"/>
did he withdraw until liberty was effectually ſecured, and its triumphs were proclaimed throughout our happy country.</p>
            <p>Through many a weariſome and long cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, and in all the viciſſitudes of war, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proſperous, and often adverſe, he was the uniform, the faithful, and the ſteadfaſt friend.</p>
            <p>In his higheſt proſperity he entertained no thoughts of ambition; and in the darkeſt and moſt gloomy hour, when the hopes of many were beginning to fail, and they were almoſt ready to give the ſtruggle for liberty up, the ſteady ſoul of WASHINGTON, firm and unmov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, animated with the pureſt patriotiſm; and fixing his hopes on Heaven, was ſtable as a rock. He never for a moment deſerted the all important cauſe, nor ſuffered himſelf to deſpair of ſucceſs. At every hazard he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to defend the intereſts of his beloved country, or that he would not ſurvive its downfall, but periſh rather in the general ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>If the united voice of America did not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it unneceſſary, there are, I perceive in this aſſembly not a few who would be ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the juſtice of the character which I have thus far drawn. There are thoſe here who were with him in the war, almoſt from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end, who were witneſſes of his wiſdom in the council and his valor in the field—who were trained to arms in his camp, who have often fought by his ſide, and whom
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036983_0010_100C330A2F3C8398"/>
I ſee alive this day to the friendſhip which was contracted in adverſity, and cemented by the precious blood of many a fallen and many a ſurviving patriot. Aſk theſe men—aſk all of this diſcription, to a man, who ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened throughout America, on this mournful occaſion, what the deceaſed WASHINGTON was —whether he was always at his poſt in the hour of danger—whether he loved his country— whether he was <hi>faithful</hi> to the important truſt which ſhe committed to his hands? and read the anſwer in their eyes.</p>
            <p>O! WASHINGTON! now that thou art gone, delicacy to thy feelings no longer forbids ſtrict juſtice to thy merits. To thy country thou ever waſt a "good and faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>When the ſtorm of war was over, he took an affectionate leave of his brave companions in arms, reſigned his commiſſion into the hands of Congreſs, and returned to the quiet walks of private life. But there he was not long permitted to enjoy repoſe. In him were concentered the valor of the ſoldier, and the wiſdom of the ſage; and he was called upon by the unanimous voice of his countrymen, to adminiſter the government which they had ordained, to "preſerve domeſtic tranquility," and perpetuate the liberty he had contributed ſo much to acquire. The conſtiution of the United States was quite a new experiment. It was the reſult not only of their united wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but of their mutual conceſſions alſo,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036983_0011_100C330C39CC95C8"/>
and the adminiſtration of it muſt of neceſſity have been an arduous taſk to which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt experience, prudence, and intelligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone were adequate. It was in our now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friend that theſe qualities were in the higheſt degree combined, and on his ſhoulders was impoſed the mighty burden. In the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Chief Magiſtrate, for eight years he laboured inceſſantly to promote the public good, which evidently appeared to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object of his ambition.</p>
            <p>On the ſubject of politics, I am but little inſtructed, and with it, it is ſtill leſs my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to intermeddle. To ſay nothing then, of the acknowledged ſuperiority of the beloved Preſident's talents as a ſtateſman, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to obſerve, that notwithſtanding the contrariety of opinion that ſoon appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our fellow-citizens reſpecting govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a ſcience, or the adminiſtration of it as an art: notwithſtanding that upon this ſubject, brother and brother, father and ſon, were often found divided againſt each other; yet, not the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion of GEORGE WASHINGTON's integrity ever mingled itſelf with any diſapprobation of public meaſures.</p>
            <p>In March 1797, he reſigned this honorable and important office, and retired once more to his peaceful abode at Mount Vernon, which had long been the favorite object of his wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. His reſignation was accompanied by an affecting token of his love, in communicating to his fellow-citizens the reſult of his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036983_0012_100C330DC9089B58"/>
and in tendering to them his laſt father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advice reſpecting their ſentiments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards each other, and their true poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as a nation. And then, with all the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of parental fondneſs, he took an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate leave.</p>
            <p>If on this ſorrowful occaſion, a place could be found for any criticiſm on his ſtyle and compoſition, I would juſt obſerve that the writings of WASHINGTON, correct without ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, elegant without art, reſemble a native woodland flower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which diſplays numberleſs undeſcribable beauties to the eye of every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, itſelf alone unconſcious of its charms. —While his precious memory ſhall warm and animate, theſe will pleaſe, inſtruct and edify the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>He now flattered himſelf that he had bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a final adue to all the troubles and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of public life, and that he ſhould be permitted to ſpend the little remainder of his days in peace. But, alas! the deceitfulneſs of all earthly proſpects! like the Patriarch Abraham, he had to encounter the ſevereſt trial in the concluding ſcene.</p>
            <p>His country, alarmed by the apprehenſion of foreign danger, caſt her eyes once more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her well-tried, faithful general, for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if the calamity which ſeemed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ſhould actually befal: I have called this the ſevereſt trial, becauſe he was now far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years, and his arm was enfeebled by age. But old as he was, though he heard with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036983_0013_100C330F629103A8"/>
grief, he obeyed with promptitude his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's call and prepared himſelf once more to take the field, whenever neceſſity ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and buckle the armour on his weary limbs.</p>
            <p>In this juncture of affairs it pleaſed the God of Heaven, whoſe councils are to us unknown, to take him from us, and releaſe him from all his labours. He called him to put the harneſs off, and enter into his reſt. What fate awaits our beloved country, it belongs to him alone who can pry into futurity, to tell. We hope &amp; truſt in God that the olive branch of America will ſtill be regarded, and that our ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors abroad and envoys extraordinary, will, by his bleſſing ſucceed, in accommodating on honourable terms, all exiſting differences, and in perpetuating peace with all the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>But if not: if our ears are again to be aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the din of arms, and war ſhall rage, we ſhall miſs this valiant faithful man, and the anxious enquiry in America, will be, where ſhall we find another WASHINGTON?</p>
            <p>In drawing the character of the great and illuſtrious, it is not the only object to pay that tribute to merit which juſtice demands, but eſpecially to exhibit their example for the imitation of others. With this view, permit me to add, that our departed friend was not only a faithful, but a Godly man. Fidelity to his country was an amiable and ſtriking trait in his character; but to render it complete,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036983_0014_100C3311C6C068A8"/>
we add, piety to God. This, like the oil on Aaron's robe, gives it a ſweet perfume: or, like the mantle of Elijah, on the ſhoulders of Eliſha, it ſpreads majeſtic grace and glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round it. Such was WASHINGTON. Virtue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned his private life, and his firſt act of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential duty was to dedicate himſelf to God, and commend his country to his divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. This act of piety made the hearts of all good men in America glad, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced under the auſpices of a chief magiſtrate who thus paid homage to the Ruler of the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>But ſtill more was the piety of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the ground of their confidence through the more perilous ſcenes of war. While his valor and fortitude qualified him, above his fellows, for the command of a patriotic army, this not only endeared him to all the wiſe and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but made him, as they rightly ſuppoſed, the peculiar care of Heaven. They were not miſtaken. This fortified his integrity, and this ſecured his camp. The valiant chief, altho' he was himſelf an hoſt, and ſuperior in courage and conduct to the oppoſite commanders, yet knowing that "the battle was not always to the ſtrong," with his eyes directed to Heaven, commended himſelf and his army to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of infinite wiſdom, and to the protection of our omnipotent ſhield. Thus qualified he went forth under the banners of the Lord of hoſts: he fought in his ſear, and conquered in his name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:036983_0015_100C3314E7E539F0"/>"The firſt in peace, and the firſt in war," he was a ſingular example of virtue, and piety ih both. In the humble ſphere of private life, in the more ſplendid chair of ſtate, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the confuſion and licentiouſneſs of war, this great man "walked with God." His heart was impreſſed with the higheſt rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his holy name, and in his preſence the mouth of the profane was ſhut.</p>
            <p>Who of the heroes of antiquity ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pete for fame with the illuſtrious chief?— Alexander was vain glorious, and ſometimes cruel—Caeſar was ambitious—and the life of Cato terminated in an act of ſuicide.</p>
            <p>But WASHINGTON was not ambitious. Such was his modeſty that but for the trump of fame, the riſing generation had not known that he was the "hero of liberty" who reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from bondage. Guided by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and protected by the power, he was alſo reſigned to the will of Heaven. Piety adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his youth; it rendered his "hoary head a crown of glory," and ſoftened his dying bed. His ſetting ſun went down unclouded and ſerene, the happy preſage of a bright ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day.</p>
            <p>Alas! "The Godly man hath ceaſed, and the faithful hath failed."</p>
            <p>Heavy and afflictive is the loſs which the people of America have ſuſtained by the death of this great man. It is only in ſome meaſure retrievable by the improvement we ſhall make of it. Let us then, under this ſore viſitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:036983_0016_100C3316708CB600"/>
learn in the firſt place, humbly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and adore the hand of God. He is the ſovereign diſpoſer of all events, and he has a right to do whatſoever he will with his own. In his adorable, but to us miſterious providence he has taken away our WASHINGTON, and though we cannot but mourn his loſs, yet, ſince it is the will of Heaven, we will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not to repine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſubſſimion to the divine will, let us add a grateful acknowledgement of divine goodneſs. God who hath taken our dear friend away, firſt gave him to us, qualified for the moſt important purpoſes. The whole of his uſeful life was devoted to the good of his country, and he lived to a good old age. He lived to perform the important work of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and eſtabliſhing the independence of America, and proclaiming liberty to all her ſons. Thro' all the perils and the fatigues of war: amidſt the dangers of the field of battle, and under the pitched tent on the cold ground by night, the life and health of the illuſtrious chief, and of his valiant army, were moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly preſerved. Many a brave patriot fell; but the Gen. on whom ſo much depended was carefully protected from the "peſtilence that walked in darkneſs, and from the arrow which flew by day." Nor was he taken hence until he ſaw his country ſmilling in peace, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled under the moſt excellent conſtitution that any nation on earth ever enjoyed. For all
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036983_0017_100C315FF67AB760"/>
theſe mercies "let the people praiſe thee, O God; let all the people praiſe thee."</p>
            <p n="3">3 The character of the deceaſed, while it endears his memory, ſhould alſo be improved into a ſource of conſolation to all who mourn his death. People of America—affectionate fellow-citizens of his native ſtate, ye may weep for yourſelves; but weep not for WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON. He reſts at length from all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: and if a manſion be prepared in glory, for piety and virtue, thither I truſt he is gone, and there will he ſhine; as a ſtar in the ferma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ever and ever. "Bleſſed are the dead who die in the Lord."</p>
            <p n="4">4. Suffer me to recommend the example of our departed friend, to the imitation of his countrymen. It is dignified and lovely, and ſhews to what perfection human nature may arrive. In this, although he is dead, he ſtill ſpeaks to us. Ye youth of America, the hope of your country—ye riſing patriots of Virginia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> learn that to be truly great, you muſt be ſincerely good.</p>
            <p>Who will now fill the place of the American chief? The expecting eyes of your country are turned upon you. She will have need for you, in the cabinet, at leaſt, if not in the field. If you would be prepared to do her ſervice, ſtudy the character, cultivate the virtues, and follow the example of your WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Finally, let us improve this ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by ſerious reflections on our own tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the duſt. We have here no abiding city.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036983_0018_100C331AD307AC70"/>
"It is appointed to all men once to die," and the temple of this body will ſoon be diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let us apply to the redeemer of the world for pardon, and ſalvation. Let us implore the aſſiſtance of divine grace that we may "ſo number our days as to apply our hearts to wiſdom." Let us cordially imbibe the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of piety, and ſteadily purſue the practice of virtue; ſo that when this "earthly houſe of our tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved, we may have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens."—AMEN.</p>
