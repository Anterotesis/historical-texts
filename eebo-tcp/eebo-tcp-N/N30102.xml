            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the Univerſal Good of Mankind is, or, at leaſt, ought to be, as well the particular End of every private Member of that large Community, as the more general Aim and Ambition of all publick Societies; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently follows.

            <head>CHAP. I Of the GOUT.</head>
            <p>THIS is a Diſtemper of that inveterate and malignant Nature, as to be a continual Foil and Reproach to the beſt Phyſicians of all Ages: No Method of Phyſic, Diet or Habit, however regular, reaſonable and orderly; no Preſcriptions, tho' bearing the ſpecious and plauſible Sanction of Academic, Graduate, and Collegate Learning, being able to give a Turn to this Diſtemper, or reach its ſecret Receſſes; for retiring into the Extremit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of the fine Capillary Veſſels, where by reaſon of the unequal Celerity and languid Motion of the Blood in thoſe Parts, it's venemous Particles are ſuffer'd to attract one another with great Violence. It bids Defiance to all their Art, and will oftner yield to one lucky Noſtrum, than all the repeated Aſſaults of what they call Regular Practiſe, which is never more ineffectual and at a Loſs, than in this Caſe; and more eſpecially, if that Noſtrum be prepared as theſe DROPS are, for ſuch a Species of Simples as are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing render'd, by ſuch Preparation, fit to pierce the very inmoſt nervous Cells, increaſe the Impetus of the Vital and Animal Fluids, and follow the Particles of the morbific Matter thro' all the fine Meanders of the Blood till having diſturb'd their Attraction, and broke them by repeated Colliſions, one againſt on other, into the minuteſt Parts, it forces moſt of them thro' the Pores of the Body by Perſpiration, obtunding, abſorbing, and and carrying the reſt away with it in its Courſe, til ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at the Kidneys, they are ſecreted there from the Blood, and paſs away by Urine. All which Operations Theſe DROPS to a Miracle perform, by Virtue of their Diaphoretic, Abſorbent, and Detergent Qualities; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at once all the Emunctories of the Body, and forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, through them, they very Root an Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s of the Diſtemper they are to cure; and that this is the only
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039981_0007_1015CA3463991920"/>
effectual, rational Method of treating this obſtinate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper the Gout, I appeal to that great Searcher of Nature, Dr. Sydenham, who ſays, Whatſoever is aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in diſcharging the foul, vicious Humours, out of the Body, can never fail of anſwering the Intention of Cure for which it is deſign'd, whethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the Gout, Rheumatiſm, or any other Cronick Diſtemper. And his Authority, I ſhould think, ought not reaſonably to be diſputed in the Cure of this Diſtemper, whom not only a vaſt Stock of acquir'd Learning, together with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious natural Capacity, improv'd by long and great Practice, and Experience upon Others; but alſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and unconquerable Gouty Habit in his own Body, confirm'd in this Opinion, That there was no other Method of treating this terrible Diſtemper; which is alſo confirm'd by what thoſe two admiral Phyſicians, Dr. Keile, and Dr. Quincey, have told us concerning the Cauſe of it; which, ſay they, is created by the muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous Glands in the Joints becoming gritty and ſtiff, by Means of a ſharp acid Humour flowing thereon, which coagulating the oily Liquor ſecreted by them for lubricating the Ends of the Bones at their ſeveral Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, to render them apt and ready for Motion, makes it, inſtead of promoting and aſſiſting that Motion, impeed and prevent it, by clogging the Interſtices, ſo that they cannot move at all, at leaſt, not without very great Pain, hard'ning, by Degrees, into white, chalky, gritty Stones, which are forced to be cut, or otherwiſe taken out by Art, from the Joints of the Hands and Feet of the miſerable Patient, as daily Experience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts.</p>
            <p>Now you are to obſerve, That the Particles which compoſe this ſharp acid Humour, are ſurrounded with little pointed Needles, which wound and irritate the Veſſels thro' which they move, and the very Globules of the Blood it ſelf, beating and coagulating thereby any Fluid with which they mix; but theſe being either obtunded and blunted, and the points of them, as it were, ſheath'd and wrap'd up in ſome of the Particles of this Medicene, or elſe drove violently againſt one another
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039981_0008_1015CA625B94DA20"/>
with a Force ſufficiently to break off thoſe little pointed Spears, and render them capable of flying off by Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by others; or elſe ſo diſturb'd and ſeparated by this new Auxiliary Force, that they cannot attract one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but unwillingly diſperſe themſelves in the Blood, and are many of them ſecreted and carried off by Urine; This I ſay, muſt neceſſarily anſwer the Intention of Cure; for by this Means they are rendr'd incapable of irritating, loading, or coagulating any of the Fluids; and then, on Courſe, the Diſtemper before caus'd by them, muſt by Degrees abate, and at length abſolutely ceaſe. To which Ends and Purpoſes. Theſe DROPS are ſo excellently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted and prepar'd, and are in their Nature ſo very Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbent, Detergent and Diaphoretic, that it is morally impoſſible they ſhould fail of working a Cure, which can only be perform'd by the joint Operation of thoſe three Qualities, which are ſcarce to be met with, in any conſiderable Degree, in any one Medicine in the World, but THIS alone.</p>
            <p>But perhaps, ſome who underſtand no nore of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper than the Pain and Torture it gives them, will ſay, That probably in the former Stage of this Diſtemper, theſe Drops may be effectual; but, ſay they, mine is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Stomach, Bowels, &amp;c. and they will not be able to reach it there. But how weak and trivial an Objection this is, will appear from a Reflection upon this Phaſe of the Gout, which is only caus'd by a Weakneſs and debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature, thro' frequent Debauches, hard Drinking, long Courſes of uſeleſs Phyſic, &amp;c. whereby the Impetus of the Blood becomes ſo weak and languid, and its Motion ſo ſlow and irregular, as to permit the morbific Particles to attract one another in the Blood Veſſels of thoſe Parts, which can only be remedied by ſuch Things as warm and increaſe the Blood's inteſtine Motion, ſo breaking and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing the Attraction of the venemous Particles, and ſending them back again to the extream Parts, where they are to be treated as before: For which Purpoſe, nothing in Nature can be better fitted than theſe Drops, which have ſuch a fine invigorating, Alexiterial Property in them

            <p>But in the latter Phaſe, where the morbific Matter is not only to be repelled, but the faint and languid State of Nature enliven'd and invigorated, it is neceſsary that you increace your Doſe as the Cauſe may require, in any warm Vehicle, as before; compoſing your ſelf after it, and encouraging Sweat by all proper Methods.</p>
            <p>After this in order effectually to rout this moſt terible Enemy it is neceſſary you continiue to take a ſmall Doſe of about 100, or 150 Drops, every Three Nights alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; taking three Nights, and miſſing three Nights; till ſuch time as you find the Strength of the Diſtemper to abate, which it will ſenſibly do in a ſmall time, and at length quite go off.</p>
            <p>Inſtances of the Cure of this Diſtemper, by Theſe DROPS, might be given in great Numbers, from Perſons of undoubted Credit, and Reputation, on enquiry, would ſatiſfy the Curious of their wonderful Effect in that Intention: but not bring willing to tire the Reader; and theſe Drops, by their continual Succeſs, ſo ſtrongly recomending themſelves?

This Diſtemper ariſes from obſtructions in the Glands of the Liver, thereby preventing a due Secretion of the Gall from the Blood, by them in that Viſcus, which Bilious Particles circulating therewith, gives a Yellow Tincture to the Mucus or Curpus Reticulare ſpred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cuticula, which from thence appears of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: This is the firſt and common Phaſe of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; but it will ſometimes, and more eſpecially in hard Drinkers, arrive to that height, as to Cauſe a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Spitting and Vomiting of Blood, which is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckon'd a Mortal Symptom; for it is cauſed by the Obſtructions in the Hepatic Glands becomming ſchirrous; and ſo indurated, as with great Difficulty (if at all) to be opened again; which ſtraitens the Motion of the Blood through that Viſcus ſo much, as to cauſe it to revulſe with a great Motion into the Gaſtrick Arteries, which go off from the Hepatic, inſomuch, that breaking through them, it drains into the Stomach, and by that means the Courſe of that fluid is alter'd the Secretion of the Bile at an End, and the whole Syſtem deſtroy'd: So that this latter Stage of the Diſtemper is ſeldom or never to be cured; but may eaſily be prevented by taking the former Phaſe in time; powerfully deterging thoſe tartarous abdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Particles out of the Blood; which can only be by ſtrong Detergents and Diaphoreticks, (which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prov'd to you theſe DROPS are; and therefore cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THESE are one and the ſame Diſtemper, in two ſeveral Degrees; the Stone being only concerted Gravel, and the Gravel the Matter whereof the Stone is form'd and in ſome what is waſh'd off it by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful Nepritic and Lytholutics; both of them being in their Degree an aggregate of the tartarous Particles of the Urine, pent up by the Straitneſs of the Urinary Ducts; which is only to be cur'd by diſſolving the Stone, widening and deterging the Paſſages; and ridding the Blood of thoſe tartarous Particles by Diaphoretics, before the Secretion of Urine is perform'd: All which ſeveral Operations theſe DROPS perform to a Wonder, and have, by their Detergent Diuretick Quality, brought away, from ſeveral Perſons, STONES of the Size of a ſmall Nut Kernel, when every other Remedy has fail'd to give them Eaſe; and, by being continued afterwards, cleans'd the Blood of it's tartarous Particles, ſo as to prevent another Fit for many years.</p>

Hints concerning their Cauſe and Syſtems, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the Diſcription of the Eeffects of theſe Drops in all thoſe Intentions.</p>
            <p>But firſt, it is neceſſary to premiſe what an Aſthma is in general: That it is a frequent, difficult, and ſhort Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Breathing, join'd with a hiſſing Sound, and a Cough; eſpecially in the Night, in cold Weather, and in a prone Poſture, or lying down: The former becauſe the Preſſure of the Atmoſphere is greater in the Night then in the Day, when the Noxious Vapours exhal'd and diſpel'd by the Force of the Sun Beams. In the Night, by reaſon of the Pores of the Body being contracted by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambient Cold, our Tpanſpiration is leſſen'd, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Gravedo or Weight of perſpirable Matter enſues; which being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lung upon the lungs, clogs them, and renders them leſs apt to perform their Office; and in the laſt Caſe, from the Preſſure which the contents of the Abdomen, when the Body is in that Poſture, make upon the Diaphragm, thereby leſſening the Capacity of the Thorax or Breaſt, ſo that the Lungs are too much confin'd, and cannot dilate themſelves ſufficient to receive a due Quantity of Air.</p>
            <p>This being premis'd, it will be eaſily underſtood, how theſe ſeveral Kinds of Aſthmas are produced: The firſt or Humid, call'd alſo the Peluretic Aſthma, ariſes from the Redundance of Rheumatic Serum, and viſcous Humours in the Blood, which being too thick to paſs through the ſmall Fibres of the Lungs ſtick cloſe to the Sides of thoſe Veſſels, and obſtruct the Blood in its Circulation; the Parts ſwell and often ulcerate, with great Pain, feveriſh Habbits, and Difficulty of breathing: Or elſe the pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Particles are ſpewed out into the Bronchiae, eſpecially if not impregnated with a due Proportion of Salts, cauſing a continual irritating Cough: In both which Caſes all inciding Pectorals are good, all Diaphoretits, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever attenuates and leſſens the Quantity of Serum; by that means depleting the extended Veſſels, and Working a Revulſion of the ſtagnating Humours: Which nothing can better effect then theſe DROPS, which evacuate both by Perſpiration and Urine, and are certainly, at the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039981_0015_1015CA412BE4A220"/>
ſame time, one of the very beſt Cardiacs in the whole World.</p>
            <p>The next Species of this Diſtemper, is the dry or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoric Aſthma, caus'd either by too great a Repletion of a cachochymious Blood call'd a Plethora, or elſe by too great a Rarefaction of that Fluid in it's Veſſels; ſo that the fine Canalls of the Lungs are too far diſtended; and conſequently there is not room enough for the Air to inflate the Veſſels, which produces an Inability of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, for want of a due Degree of Expanſion in that Viſcus: Such Perſons are generally crying out for Air; they always ſeem as if girted hard upon their Cheſt, and are almoſt become Victims to a long Scorbutick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetic Habit; of which this is the laſt, and oftentimes, for want of proper Remedies apply'd in time, fatal Symptoms; or in this Caſe there is no time to uſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teratives, which work but ſlowly in the Maſs of Blood; whereas here we want an immediate Aſſiſtance; which can only be obtain'd by a Conjunction of Cardiacs and Diaphoretics, both which Qualities are eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable in theſe DROPS; Which can therefore never fail the Intention of Cure in this Diſtemper,</p>
            <p>The Third and laſt Sort of Aſthma I mention'd, was the Nervous; which is occaſion'd by a Dificiency of the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torl Muſcles, for want of a ſufficient Quantity of Spirits to nouriſh and contract them; and is the dir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

One learned Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner ſays, the Bark is a violent Stiptic, and Aſtringent; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is ſolutive, and will of it ſelf, without proper Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, paſs immediately downwards.

            <p>Now if this be the Caſe, that theſe great and learned Men cannot agree among themſelves, neither as to the Nature, nor Effect of this magical Drug; is it not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be fear'd, and that with very good Reaſon, that if one is miſtaken, they may all of them be ſo; the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof will be, that this famous Panacea, like the Jay in the Fable, ſtript of all its borrow'd Pomp, will appear of no other Uſe, but to fill up the Variety of Nature's Works, receiving a Value only from Opinion, grounded on the Weakneſs of the one Part of the World, and the Wileyneſs of the other.</p>
            <p>But if there be any Virtue in the Drug, the Taſt it ſelf ſeems to point it out to be Stiptic, and Aſtringent, which is alſo generally allow'd by all who have any Skill in it; while for Faſhion ſake they admit of other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as if it were by preſcriptive Right; and for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt invent new ones to Authorize its Adminiſtration in ſome Preſent Neceſſity: Now, if once it is allow'd, the Bark is Styptic and Aſtringent, it points out directly to the Manner of its Operation and Effect; in ſeemingly giving a turn to ſome certain periodical Exacerbations; for which it is more generally adminiſtred, as intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fevers, Hemicraneas, Haemoptoes, Epilipſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

From whence I conclude, that this mighty Medicine, like a cunning Mountebank, deludes us with plauſible Appearances, and inſtead of really

And laſtly, to aſſure the whole World that theſe Drops are no Quack Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Drugs injudicicouſly mixt and jumbled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without either Art or Deſign, but ſuch as are grounded on both, and carefully ſuited to anſwer the
