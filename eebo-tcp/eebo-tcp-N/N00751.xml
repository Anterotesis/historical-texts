            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough I muſt own my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to write upon this Subject, any thing worthy to be expoſed to the publick view, ſince my Education hath not given me thoſe Advantages of Stile and Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, altogether neceſſary for ſuch an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: Yet conſidering I had the miſerable Experience of what hath been barbarouſly inflicted on me, with many others my Fellow Sufferers, who are ſtill groaning under the moſt inſupportable Miſeries; I thought my ſelf bound in Duty to publiſh, as well as I can expreſs it, what was plain Matter of Fact, to the end it might more powerfully move your
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000905_0006_0FAC9D8FE1925C40"/>
Compaſſion, and excite you Charity for the Redemption of thoſe who remain to this Day under their Egyptian Task-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. A full Account of which you have in the enſuing Relation, wherein I have made it my Buſineſs, to give you a clear and particular view of the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Paſſages that happened during the unfortunate time of my Confinement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe barbarous Salvages. I ſhall offer nothing but Truths, which ten Years Sufferings have made me too long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. We were not only ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from our Native Country, (being Engliſh men, and my ſelf born in <hi>Ratcliff</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Briſtol</hi>) but from all the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as well as Temporal Comforts. We were confin'd amongſt thoſe whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was compoſed of Cruelty, whoſe Cuſtoms were Extravagant, and whoſe Uſages almoſt intolerable; what from the hardneſs of our Labours, and the coarſneſs of our Proviſions, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the moſt preſſing Extremities, which cauſed us to think and contrive all ways and means to procure our deſired Liberties; which conſidering how nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly we were watch'd, and how cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000905_0007_0FAC9D90A4FB7010"/>
kept, was almoſt impoſſible to be ef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fected.</p>
            <p>I need not mention here how I made my Eſcape, with two others of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, ſince I have given you an exact Account of it, with all its Circumſtances, in the following Relation, with what happened afterwards to the Perſon who was inſtrumental in our happy Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for which we are in Duty bound, during the whole Courſe of our Lives, to own the particular Providence of God, to whoſe Aſſiſtance and Protection we owe our preſent Safety.</p>
            <p>The chiefeſt Deſign of my publiſhing this Book, is to caution all Seafaring men, whoſe particular Voyages carry them into the <hi>Streights,</hi> that they take all poſſible care not to be trapan'd by theſe ſubtile Pirates, who infeſt thoſe Coaſts, where we unfortunately fell into their Hands; and that reflecting on the Barbarities they muſt expect to ſuffer from thoſe mercileſs Enemies, it will be their ſureſt Intereſt to defend themſelves to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power, even to the laſt Extremity, Death it ſelf being to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before that, or any other Slavery.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000905_0008_0FAC9D923158BC78"/>Another Motive is, That I hope what I write, may be a means to procure Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for theſe my Country men, who are now labouring under the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Miſeries, and who would be very ſerviceable at this time againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy; whoſe deplorable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on hath been not long ſince publiſhed and recommended in a Brief to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for two whole Years, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

            <p>In the Year 1680, the Engliſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that were under this inhuman Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi> bewailing their own Condition, making moan to one another, and praying to God for Deliverance, at laſt concluded amongſt themſelves to draw a Petition to our late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> giving him to underſtand their miſerable Condition in this Captivity: which being done, the King took it into Conſideration, and ſent over Captain <hi>Francis Nicholſon</hi>; who being come, and ſeeing the Cruel Bondage his poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men were in, their hard Labour and cruel Fare, having therewith many cruel Stripes and Blows, he could not but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their Condition, and prayed God that he might come to ſome Compoſition with that Helliſh Tyrant for them. The Emperor at the ſame time ſent for the Shack, or Chief over all the Jews in his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000905_0013_0FAC9D95E5408B78"/>
Dominion, and bid him build a Town, which would be better for the Jews than the Cane Houſes, (his Name was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Memoran</hi>) and at that time Captain <hi>Nicholſon</hi> made an Agreement with the Emperor for the Chriſtians, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> were delivered him up, the Emperor wiſhing them a good Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Tangier</hi>; the Captain took them out of the Town that Night, which the Shack of the Jews hearing of, that came to the Emperor, telling him, if he would let him have the Chriſtians to build the Jews Town, he would give him as much Money as the Captain had agreed with him for: the Emperor bid him come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the Morning. Then the Shack or Chief of the Jews went immediately home to his Houſe, and got a Preſent ready, and ſent it in to the Emperor's Wife, that ſhe might ſolicite the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for him: which having received, ſhe ſent word back by the Eunuchs, that ſhe would endeavour to prevail with him, which ſhe did. And the next Morning he ſpoke again to the Emperor, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent out his Negroes to drive back the Chriſtians, which were hurried
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000905_0014_0FAC9D96A37291D8"/>
again to their Works in a cruel manner. The <hi>Moors</hi> of his City <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> ſeeing that, curſed the Jews for doing it. But the Captain could in no wiſe prevail with this grievous Tyrant the Emperor, (notwithſtanding the Captain had done what in him lay to have got the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans away) who ſaid he would not part with them till the Town was finiſhed. So they went to work with great Chops, and Baskets to carry Earth in; and the Negroes were ſet over them to keep them at it from Morning to Night. When the Town was finiſhed, he put in his Negroes: but the Curſe of the Jews fell upon their own Governour, his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief returned on his own Head, as will ſhortly be ſhewn. In the mean time the poor Chriſtians were grievouſly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and puniſhed by thoſe Helliſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes at the Command of this wicked and inhumane Tyrant the Emperor, and had ſcarce time to take any Nouriſhment, or eat any of their bad Bread that was allowed them, but with a great many Threats, Stripes and Blows by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, bidding them turn <hi>Moors.</hi> In which condition they prayed to God to

preſerve them in their Faith; in which, through his Aſſiſtance, they remained conſtant.</p>
            <p>Some time after Captain <hi>Nicholſon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone from thence, the Emperor laid Siege againſt a City called <hi>Tarradant,</hi> in the South part of that Dominion, being kept by a King whoſe Name was <hi>Mully Hammet</hi>: and having been there a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſent to the chief of the Jews, to bring him up ſome Goods which he wanted from <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> When he had gotten Mules, and carried them to the place where the Emperor was in Camp, the Vice Roy's Son being there with the Emperor, went to the ſaid Shack or chief of the Jews, and deſired him to aſſiſt him with ſome Money, and his Father would repay him, when he, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chief of the Jews, ſhould return to <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> He told him his Father owed him already ſeveral thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, and would not pay him any, for as yet he could get none from him: and ſaid moreover, if he ſhould die and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, he would not lend him a penny. Of which paſſages he acquainted his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, writing a Letter thereof to <hi>Macque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000905_0016_0FAC9D9828A4E840"/>
Afterwards the Chief of the Jews went to <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> to the Vice Roy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Coyd Birry,</hi> and told him he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Emperor of the Care he had in his Abſence of his Caſtle and Buſineſs; he taking little notice of him, but returning him Thanks for his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he went away. But <hi>Coyd Birry</hi> the Governour (being ſo called in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Abſence) ordered one of his chief Negroes in a little time after to go and take ſuch a Horſe which he deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, and go to the place where the Country People kept their Market, to ſee if he could find the ſaid Chief of the Jews; and if he ſaw him, take little notice of him; but if he had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, watch as he went home to his Houſe, and kill him. The Negroe did as he was ordered, and eſpying the Shack, or Chief of the Jews, going home to his Houſe, in a Road which lay through a parcel of Olive Trees, the Negro came to him, pretending Kindneſs to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad to ſee him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and riding by his ſide along on Horſeback, ſpied his opportunity very diligently, ſo ſpurred his Horſe over him, rode upon him and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000905_0017_0FAC9D98E0A92138"/>
trode out his Brains. Word thereof was quickly carried to the Vice-Roy, that the Chief of the Jews was killed, at which he ſeemed to be ſorry, that the People might take no notice thereof, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Emperor therewith, and had made ſearch, but knew not who had done it. The Emperor ſent him word back, that if he did not find out who did it, he would cut off his Head, and ordered the ſaid Vice Roy to put the Governour of the Jews Son to be the Chief in his ſtead; but the old Jew was ſoon forgotten by the Emperor.</p>
            <p>When the Emperor had laid Siege ſome Years againſt <hi>Tarradant,</hi> and could not take it, he returned home to <hi>Macque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> After he had been at home a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, he went againſt that City with about 70000 Horſe and Foot, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that if any Chriſtians knew what belonged to mining he would ſet them to work; and if they took the Town, they ſhould have their Liberty; ſo four Engliſh Men undertook the Work, the <hi>Moors</hi> digged, and they gave Directions. The Mines being finiſhed, and 30 Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Engliſh Powder rowled into the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000905_0018_0FAC9D9A90D2E668"/>
Mine, and a Train laid; the Chriſtian that fired it was blown up: and a Breach was made in the Caſtle-Wall, but they could not enter, their Enemies fired ſo thick upon them, killing a great many of <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> the Emperor's Men. They mined again under the <hi>Burges,</hi> or ſmall Forts: after Powder was put in, and a Train laid, he that gave fire to it, had his Arm ſtruck off, the <hi>Burg</hi> was blown up with the People therein. And the Emperor <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> coming to view the Breach, and being told by the People, the Chriſtian had loſt his Arm, he ordered his chiefeſt Doctor to take care and heal him; for in caſe he did not ſee to him carefully, he ſhould loſe his Head. <hi>Mully Hammet</hi> got up his People to the Breach, and kept out the Emperor and his Forces, that they could not enter. Afterwards <hi>Mully Hammet</hi> went out of his Caſtle with a ſmall Guard, and meeting with ſome of the Emperor's Scouts, one of them knowing <hi>Mully Hammet,</hi> cock'd his Piece and ſhot him to death: Then <hi>Mully Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s Guard fought with <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi>'s Scouts, and there were ſeveral killed on
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000905_0019_0FAC9D9B20FC32D8"/>
both ſides. Some of <hi>Mully Hammet</hi>'s Guards retired into the Caſtle, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the chiefeſt of them that were in the Caſtle, that their King was killed: preſently they proclaimed <hi>Mulla Rann</hi> (being the chiefeſt of the Governours in <hi>Mully Hammet</hi>'s time) to be their King. Which News being carried to the Emperor by his Scouts, he enquired who had killed <hi>Mully Hammet?</hi> they told him one of the Scouts, which he ſent preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for by a Meſſenger, and bid him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him that he ſhould have a good Reward for killing him; he being brought before the Emperor, expecting a great Reward for ſo doing, after he had examin'd him, he rewarded him with calling him Dog, and ſaid he ſhould die for killing <hi>Mully Hammet,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cauſed him to be made faſt to a Mule's Tail, and ſo had him dragged through the Camp, and ordered one to go before and declare, that it was for killing of <hi>Mully Hammet</hi>; he was dragged ſo long till his Body was torn in pieces; after that he had him put in a place where the Country People uſed to come into the Camp. <hi>Mully Ran</hi> kept the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000905_0020_0FAC9D9BE2BDFB60"/>
Caſtle and City, and the Emperor's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made more Mines in order to take the City and Caſtle, which being finiſhed, they blew up the Town Walls, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſmall Forts, with the People in them, and made ſo great a Breach that <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> entred his Men and took both the City and Caſtle, and promiſed the People he would be kind to them; but when he took the Town, he ſecured their Arms, Ammunition and Treaſure, and carried the People of that place to <hi>Macqueneſs:</hi> and being come down to <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> he put all the Chriſtians, and ſeveral hundreds of the Natives to work there to make a Court, and Houſes for his Women. And coming on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, (as he uſes conſtantly to do) although it rained very faſt, as he was going into one of the Houſes, the Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Workman and his Aſſiſtants going <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

doing it, ſaying, it was a Miſchance he he could not prevent; nevertheleſs he took a Piece out of one of his Boys Hands, and ſhot him to Death, and went among the Chriſtians raving and tearing as if he would have killed them all, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Negroes and Guard to beat both the <hi>Moors</hi> and the Chriſtians that were at work; which they did with ſuch Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, that many of them had their Heads and Arms miſerably broken, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Buildings more like a Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſe than a place of Work; and at the ſame time ran two of his <hi>Moors</hi> through with his Launce. So that he makes no more to kill a Man at his Pleaſure, than to kill a Dog.</p>
            <p>In a little time after the Emperor was come to <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> the three Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that were Miners; deſired their Liberty as he had promiſed: He gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and ordered a Letter to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Sally,</hi> that he ſhould ſend them away by the firſt opportunity; a Ship being ready, they deſired their Liberty, being at <hi>Sally,</hi> in order for their Journey; but the Governour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of granting it, abuſed and railed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000905_0022_0FAC9D9D677286A8"/>
on them, ſaying, they ſhould pay him ſo much a Head, or they ſhould not go. The Engliſh Man that loſt his Arm, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back and acquainted the Emperor thereof, telling him what the Governour ſaid, who wrote a Letter and ſent him, with two of his chief Negroes, ſaying, If he would not let them go off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would cut off his Head: The Governour hearing that, durſt not detain them any longer. So the three Engliſh Men, whoſe Names were <hi>William Chalender, Robert Jackſon,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Newman,</hi> through the Goodneſs of God arrived at <hi>London,</hi> and came again to their own Country.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1683. Captain <hi>Venetia</hi> the younger, a Pirate, belonging to <hi>Sally,</hi> met with one Mr. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> an Engliſh Man, who was bound for <hi>Leghorn</hi> in a Pink of 8 Guns, to whom he gave Chaſe: and when he came up to Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Pirate examined him from whence he came? he anſwered, From <hi>London</hi>; and enquired likewiſe of him whither he was bound? who ſaid, To <hi>Leghorn</hi> Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Bellamy</hi> asked him from whence he came and what Place he belonged to? he ſaid To <hi>Algier.</hi> The Pirate commanded <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi>

to hoiſt out his Boat, and bring his Paſs aboard, who anſwered, he ſhould hoiſt out his own if he had any buſineſs with him, which he did, and ſent his Lieutenant aboard on <hi>Bellamy.</hi> One of Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s Men that had been a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in <hi>Sally,</hi> knowing the ſaid Pirate told the Maſter he knew him very well, and that he belonged to <hi>Sally.</hi> When the Lieutenant came to <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s ſide. Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> placed ſome of his Men with their ſmall Arms at the entring, and ſaid, one Man ſhould not enter him ſave the Lieutenant, who viewed Mr. <hi>Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>'s Paſs, acknowledging it to be good. The Lieutenant returning aboard their own Ship, acquainted the Captain, ſaying, We'll fire at them and afright them; in order to which, he commanded them to make ready; the Pirate firing at Mr. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> he fired at them again, ſo they fought a conſiderable time: Mr. <hi>Bella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> killed and wounded about thirty of his Men, and he wounded ſome of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi>'s Men: but for want of Powder, Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> was forced to yield. When <hi>Venetia</hi> had taken him and his Company, and brought them aboard his own Ship,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000905_0024_0FAC9D9EE284DA60"/>
leaving ſeveral of his own Men in their ſtead, he began to examine Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> why he had killed and wounded ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Men? Who anſwered, he would have killed all the reſt, and him too, if he had had Powder; with that the Pirate cut him down with his Cutlaſs and rip'd him open, and ſaid, there was an end of a Dog, ſo threw his murdered Body into the Sea, and carried all his Men into <hi>Sally,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queneſs.</hi> Thus have theſe bloody Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Crew deceived many of our Country-men, telling them they belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Algier,</hi> when they belonged to <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> I pray God keep all my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and all good Chriſtians out of the Hands of that barbarous and inhumane Crew, the worſt that live upon the Earth! and that all may beware of them, hath cauſed me thus to write; being one that by ſad Experience, and from a certain knowledge I have had of them, can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure theſe things to be nothing but a real Truth; &amp; bleſs God that he has thought me worthy to eſcape them, and that I am now come ſafe to the Land of my Nativity.</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:000905_0025_0FAC9D9FA55407C0"/>In the Year 1685. A Ship being bound from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> in which were four Women, two of them being Mother and Daughter; one of thoſe Heatheniſh Pirates meeting them, gave them Chaſe, and coming up to them, examined them ſtrictly from whence they came, and whither bound? who told them as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, From <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Barbadoes</hi>; (the Pirate was <hi>Venetia</hi> the younger, who had 300 Men, and 18 Guns) after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander had enquired the ſame of them, he underſtood what they were, they telling him that they came from <hi>Algier</hi>; ſo they demanded of him to ſhew his Paſs, and ſaid he muſt hoiſt out his Boat; they ſeeing him not provided with Guns to defend himſelf, could make no Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which being done, the Captain of the Pirate took them into his Cabin, and would ſhew himſelf kind to them, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and giving them Dates.

who the young Woman was, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe was ever married?

And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards all the Chriſtians of the Ship, and the 4 Women were brought up to <hi>Macqueneſs</hi>; the Women were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor's Eunuchs, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given to the Chief of them by the <hi>Moors</hi> Captain, that one of them was a Virgin, and ſhe was immediately ſent to the Emperor's Women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Eunuch ſent to the Vice-Roy, acquainting him how he had diſpoſed of the Virgin, who ordered the other Women to be brought to his Houſe, and ordered the Negroes to drive the poor Chriſtians to hard Labour, who at Night were look'd up, amongſt

the other Chriſtian Captives, having no Suſtenance allowed them for that day; and what their poor Brethren offered them, they could not eat, being ſuch Bread as I have already deſcribed, ſo bad, that the Beaſts in that place refuſed to eat it: and what betwixt their Diet and Lodging on the cold ground, together with the Negroes hard Uſage, many of them fell ſick. And to add to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, were threatned and abuſed by the Negroes to turn <hi>Moors</hi>; but they daily prayed to God to ſtrengthen them in their Afflictions, and in his great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy work ſome way for their Deliverance out of this dreadful Bondage.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the chief Eunuch ſent word to the Emperor, that he had a Chriſtian Virgin amongſt the reſt of his Women. The Emperor ordered him to ſend her up to the Camp, with a parcel of his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs to guard her thither. When ſhe came to the Camp, the Emperor urged her, tempting her with Promiſes of great Rewards if ſhe would turn <hi>Moor,</hi> and lie with him. She earneſtly deſired of the Lord to preſerve and ſtrengthen her to reſiſt his earneſt Perſwaſions, &amp; great

Proffers, which he uſed, to have his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires fulfilled. When he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo, he fell to threatning her, and put her amongſt his Negro Women, and threatned to kill them if they offered to ſhew her any Kindneſs, where they kept her, beating and abuſing her for ſeveral days. She prayed ſtill to the Lord to ſtrengthen her, and held a resolution to withſtand him; who again ſought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with her, tempting and promiſing of her great things, if ſhe would turn, which ſhe ſtill refuſed: ſo he cauſed her to be ſtript, and whipt by his Eunuchs with ſmall Cords, ſo long till ſhe lay for dead; and he cauſed her to be carried away out of his Preſence that time, and charged his Women none of them ſhould help her till he ſent for her, which was not till two days after, and in the mean time to have no Suſtenance but that black rotten Bread: at which time he ſought again to prevail with Promiſes and Threats, which ſhe ſtill withſtood, praying to the Lord that ſhe might be preſerved from him, and be delivered from his cruel Hands. Then he prick'd her with ſuch things, as commonly his Women uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead

            <p>About four Years ago, two Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and a French man being at <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>; and as they were paſſing along the River, on a certain time in a Boat, with ſome <hi>Moors,</hi> one of which was a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he ordered the Chriſtians to go on Shore to fetch a little of their black Rusk and Water: And as they were paſſing along the River to take their Pleaſure, the Chriſtians ſaid to one another, Now is the time, with the Lord's leave, for us

to ſee for our Liberty: The French-man ſaid, The <hi>Moors</hi> would be too many for them: The Engliſh-men ſaid, Fear not, let us truſt in the Lord, and he'll deliver us. So they going aboard with their Bread and Water, the Lieutenant bid them get out their Oars, and pull up like Dogs as they were; which they bore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently. At Night ſome of the <hi>Moors</hi> lying down, they fell upon thoſe <hi>Moors</hi> that were awake.

ſaid true? but they finding not the Mule that was wanting, he ordered the Negro, immediately to be ſtript unto his Drawers, and faſtened to a Mule's Tail, which was done, and he was dragg'd ſo the ſpace of half a Mile to Priſon, there to remain; and had the Maſter-Workman ſtretch'd out by four Negroes, two at his Hands and two at his Feet, beating of him till he could not turn himſelf, bidding him take care of his Mules, ſaying, if when he came again he found ſuch bad ſtuff for his Work, he would cut off his Head. So immediately he ſent his Negro Boys to fetch the ſeventy Chriſtians that were hard at Labour making a Wall; ſo asked one of them if he could ſpeak his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage? who ſaid he could, examining him in like manner about the Stuff? who anſwered, he durſt not for fear acquaint him of the Badneſs of it: ſo he took one of his Sticks they uſed to carry after him, and calling him Dog, bid him hold his Head fare to ſtrike at: having ſtrucken him down, he knocked down all the reſt with his own Hands, and broke their Heads ſo miſerably, that the place was all bloody like a Butcher's Stall, and none of

            <p>In 1689, the Emperor ſent down to the Coyde, or Governour of <hi>Tangier,</hi> to take a view of <hi>Alarache,</hi> where was a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon belonging to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Governour taking view thereof, he ſent him farther Orders to prepare for the taking it, if he could poſſibly. So ſending back to the Emperor to provide him Forces, the Emperor ſent him down 40000 Horſe and Foot, beſides the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had there: And he laying Siege to the Place, the Spaniſh Boats fetch'd off the Officers Wives and Children. They afterwards raiſed a ſmall Fort, to keep all ſmall Veſſels or Boats from fetching any thing off. Which the Friars taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, hoiſted up a Flag of Truce; and came to a Treaty with the Governour of the <hi>Moors,</hi> till they had been with the Emperor at <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> When come thither, they told him, that if he would let them go, and take what was their

own with them, they would give him the Place, with the Chriſtians, and all the Ammunition and Guns. To which he agreed, ſaying, he would. They return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again to <hi>Alarach,</hi> ordered the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Moors</hi> to make a Feaſt; and going to their own Garriſon, told their own Governour, that they had made an Agreement with the Emperor, and that they ſhould march into <hi>Ceuta</hi> in their own Arms, ſaying, They had better do ſo, than go into Slavery amongſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. The Governour, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> dining toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: When Dinner was over, he bid him ſend for his Men, and ſend them with all ſpeed to <hi>Ceuta.</hi> They being come, he commanded them to lay down their Arms; which he (to wit the <hi>Moors</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour) quickly ſecured, telling them they muſt go up to the Emperor at <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queneſs,</hi> for he had a mind to ſee them, and afterwards they muſt return to <hi>Ceuta.</hi> So the <hi>Moors</hi> took the great Guns, with their Carriages, Muskets and Powder, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them all to the Emperor, with a Band of Men to guard them thither. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come thither, he ſet his Negroes to

drive them to work; ordering the great Guns to be unmounted, and laid flat on the Ground betwixt the two Walls, with thoſe Guns that were brought from <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mora.</hi> So the Negroes kept them at hard Slavery, beating and whipping them all day long; and at Night they were to lodg under-ground; allowing them ſuch Bread as his other poor Captives have, &amp; Water to ſuſtain them alive.</p>
            <p>After the poor Chriſtians had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone their hard Labour and cruel Stripes, for the ſpace of five months time, many of them fell ſick and died: then this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant came &amp; enquired what was become of them? they gave him account, that ſeven hundred of them were turned <hi>Moors,</hi> and five hundred were dead.

The King of <hi>Spain</hi> received their Petition; and viewing it, declared to his Council what a Condition his poor

The Ambaſſador being come an Agreement was made betwixt them, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould give a thouſand <hi>Moors</hi> for an hundred <hi>Christians.</hi> And for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Wives that were not carried off, &amp; young Children, they agreed for 4 <hi>Moors</hi> a Head. The Ambaſſador bargained with the Emperor, to have the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> down to <hi>Tittivan,</hi> lying near unto <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,</hi> and there to remain till the <hi>Moors</hi> were brought over, and left at <hi>Ceuta,</hi> a place not far from thence. After which the Ambaſſador returned home to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> acquainting his Maſter what a miſerable condition his poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were in, working from Morning to Night, allowing them nothing but old rotten Barley bread and Water; not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to have any thing to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after their hard Labour and cruel U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by the <hi>Moors,</hi> nor no Apparrel to wear, but daily beating them, and often

They anſwered, they had allowed them a Jacket and a pair of Breeches once a year; and for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, they had a certainty of Rusk, and hot Beans once a Day. But being come to their own Country, they began to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Chriſtian Captives poor condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing daily what they endured with Hunger, Cold, and Stripes; and many times the Tears fell from their Eyes for grief to ſee it; ſome of the <hi>Moors</hi> ſaying,

We are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (privately to them) but durſt not publickly own it: And at another time told the Captives, (when they ſaw the Emperor's Cruelty, often murdering one or other at his Pleaſure; and themſelves had nothing allowed them but a little of that rotten Barley-bread, and a little Butter that ſtunk) that they had rather be in <hi>Spain</hi> than there. And ſome of the <hi>Moors</hi> got back again into <hi>Spain,</hi> acquainting the People there what a cruel Tyrant their Emperor was, and how miſerably he uſed the poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And when the Spaniſh Ambaſſador returned with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> into their own Country, the King asked them how they had fared? Who gave a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as aforeſaid, of the hard Bondage and Slavery the Emperor of <hi>Morocco</hi> had kept them in whilſt they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.

Thoſe that were left behind, likewiſe petitioned him to allow them ſomething Yearly: which was done, and care taken that it ſhould be ſent over for their Uſe: As likewiſe our Fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories at <hi>Cales</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> having enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how it was with them; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Engliſh fared no better than the reſt, contributed towards their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and ſent it over from <hi>Cales</hi> to <hi>Tittivan'</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Anthony Packer,</hi> a Merchant there, deſiring him to order it them for their Relief: Who accordingly did, and they therewith bought them a few Cloaths to cover their Nakedneſs. So they wrote back to Mr. <hi>Anthony Packer,</hi> and to the Factories, returning them Thanks for their Kindneſs in remembring them, praying to God to proſper them in their Affairs. And I beſeech God to open the Hearts of our Gracious King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> as he hath done others, to grant ſome Relief for their diſtreſſed Subjects that are yet in that place, whoſe cruel Sufferings I could do no leſs than acquaint them with, being when I left them, in as poor a condition as ever.</p>

And in this Captivity. I have been, with the reſt of my poor Country men for the ſpace of Ten Years, being ſo long ſince taken; but now, through the Mercies of God, I am come to ſee my Native Country, and cannot but condole their Miſeries I have left behind under that cruel Tyrant the Emperor of <hi>Morocco</hi>; beſeeching Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that none of my Country men may ever come to have a ſhare under that hard Task-maſter.

For his Apparrel, he wears a fine Holland Shirt, with Sleeves ſo large that will make any ordinary man a pair of Drawers, beſides a large pair of Drawers of the ſame, with Breeches over them, and next to his Shirt a Garment of as fine Stuff as can be had, made of the faſhion of a Waſtcoat without Sleeves, &amp; over that a Coat of as fine Cloth as can be bought, made almoſt of our faſhion; he wears over that a ſort of Garment which they call a <hi>Shilham,</hi> or <hi>Barnooſe,</hi> but we may call it a ſhort Cloak, being wrought all over with Silver and Gold, with a Cap to go over his Head, having at the top of it a great Bob with a Fringe, and at the bottom a great Fringe all round it: on the lower part from his Breaſt it is open, and the upper part made faſt; and over that in cold Weather he wears a Cloak, with a Cap to put over his Head: upon his Head he wears ſometimes a Turbet (as they call it) made of Silk; and when it is hot weather, he wears a Garment made
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:000905_0042_0FAC9DAC69774F88"/>
of a ſort of Stuff like fine Crape, and a Hat; and on his Legs he wears fine red Boots, but different from our Faſhion: he's oftner on Horſeback than on Foot; his Guard, which are of different Stature, wear ſome of them Shoes, and have over their Shirts &amp; Drawers only Cloaks with Caps, ſome light coloured, &amp; ſome dark: ſometimes he has an hundred following him, and at other times fifty, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, he having thirty thouſand Negroes of his own Slaves.</p>
            <p>Every one of his black Guard have a Piece, and he has three or four Launces carried after him, and ſeveral Pieces rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy charged, to kill with at his pleaſure, either the Chriſtians or his own Natives. When he falls out with his Guard, he ſtrips and takes their Clothes from them, and puts them in Irons, and ſets them to work. He ſeldom returns home after his going out in a Morning, without killing one or other before he returns, by running of them through with his Launce, ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or dragging them at a Mule's Tail, either Men or Women, ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting for what he has done; <hi>Mahomet</hi> their great Prophet poſſeſſing them with
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000905_0043_0FAC9DAD23B4BF40"/>
a Belief, that if he kills any one, he merits Heaven by ſo doing; but if any Perſon ſhould kill him, he cannot avoid going to Hell. He has Water carried after him by a Boy, which he drinks, to make the People believe he drinks nothing elſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and likewiſe hath ſhort ſticks carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him daily, to beat the poor Slaves at his pleaſure, which is hourly, to vex and puniſh them, delighting in nothing more.</p>
            <p>He was firſt made a <hi>Coyde</hi> or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſome part of the Country, and by his Kindneſs and Affability to the People, he gained Reſpect from them in that Country. <hi>Mully Sheade</hi> being then King, and living in the City of <hi>Fez,</hi> there died; and the Inhabitants there being all <hi>Whites,</hi> and he a <hi>Mollato,</hi> they cryed up <hi>Mully Hammet.

            <p>Our Engliſh Governour was concerned at the loſs of <hi>Guillan</hi> &amp; his People. When the Emperor had won moſt of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and conquered <hi>Tarradant,</hi> he ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> and ordered all his Baſhaws or Governours to build Walls and great Houſes upon their own Charge, on pain of loſing their Lives. Some fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their Houſes, and ſome could not, having not wherewith to do it, being brought ſo low, he cauſing it to be ſo, that they might not rebel againſt his chief Son, called <hi>Mully Sedan,</hi> for whom he hath the greateſt Eſteem above all his Sons, thinking he may ſucceed after his Deceaſe: but I hope in God, and wiſh it may never be, for the young Tyrant

imitates his Father too much in cutting and killing the Slaves as bad as he almoſt, that the People begin to dread him as well as the old one.</p>
            <p>The Emperor's Caſtle hath four Gates belonging to it. The City of <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> is an old decay'd place, the Caſtle ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtant from it, and walled in ſome places double, and has a few old Iron Guns mounted upon them: For the Braſs Guns that were taken from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he's afraid to leave them with any of his Governours, leſt they riſe againſt him, and had them brought up to <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queneſs,</hi> plac'd within the Caſtle Gates betwixt two Walls flat upon the Ground. The Buildings within the Walls are very high, and ſeveral ſmall Forts round the Caſtle Walls. And lately he ſet the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to build two new Towns, (with which to plague his Country-People, to bring them as low as he can) which I think will never be finiſhed in his time; and if he did it on his own Coſt and Charge, he would not have ſo many Buildings. When Taxes are brought him in, he treaſures it up, taking but little out again.</p>

            <p>Whilſt I was there, he made Peace with <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; but ſoon broke it, taking ſince that time ſeveral Dutch &amp; French Ships, making Slaves of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

Then in one of his Rooms in the Caſtle, he lies down on a kind of Quilt on the Ground; and ſleeping that Night, he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes early in the Morning, and falls to his old Tyrannous and Inhumane Practices, domineering over his poor Slaves, &amp; ſets the Negroes to whip, ſtone &amp; beat them, to work harder than many times it's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to think they can hold out or endure till Night. The poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Engliſh Captives, dayly praying to God, if it be his Will, to ſupport them in this diſtreſſed Condition and to keep them and deliver them from under this miſerable Oppreſſion they are under, &amp; reſtrain the Hands of that bloody Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: And when they think of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000905_0050_0FAC9DB321EB6150"/>
Country, and the Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they cannot but greatly lament their own Condition, erecting their Prayers to Heaven for the Preſervation of their own King and Country; and that God would be pleaſed to open their Hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them in this ſad and deplorable Condition. Thus bemoaning one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they commit their Caſe to him, who is the wiſe Diſpoſer and Orderer of all things, without whoſe Permiſſion nothing can be acted or done, who can in his due Time grant them Relief.</p>
            <p>On Fridays the Emperor goes to his Place of Worſhip, having firſt viewed his Slaves, being of ſeveral ſorts, both <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Negroes,</hi> and a ſort of People called <hi>Brabboes</hi>; the laſt ſort being Natives of the Country, which he ſuppreſſeth ſo much, that they are not able to pay him Taxes, keeping them at as hard Slavery as the reſt. If he kills none in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before he goes to Worſhip, they dread him for fear he will at his return: he rides thither and back again, going about Eleven of the Clock, and returns about One, againſt which time the poor Slaves order one or other to watch, and
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000905_0051_0FAC9DB3E2FD9C70"/>
are in as great fear when they ſee him as if they muſt all be deſtroyed; and they all work more hard that day than all the reſt of the Week. He killed ſeven and twenty <hi>Moors</hi> on one day; but there's none can tell the ſeveral thouſands of poor Souls this unmerciful Tyrant hath ſtain ſince his Reign, which is now about two and twenty Years.</p>
            <p>For his Women I think he knows no the number of them, he hath ſo many both <hi>Whites, Blacks, Mollatoes,</hi> and <hi>Copper-colour'd</hi>; and for Apparel they have a piece of Silk of a Red or Yellow Colour, which they wear over their Heads. They wear Shifts or Smocks made of fine Linnin, big enough to make two Shifts, and fine Drawers that will reach down to their Heels, which are open or ſlit in the middle; and their upper Garment is fine Flannel, and a Silk Girdle about their middle: upon each of their Breaſts they wear Silver or Gold Pins, with which they faſten their upper Garment; and upon their Wriſts of their Hands they wear on each a Silver Shackle, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the Small of their Legs; and on their Feet red Slippers. He hath ſtore
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:000905_0052_0FAC9DB4A222E828"/>
of Children of ſeveral Colours. He hath built within his Caſtle fine Dwellings for himſelf to live and lodg in; and for his Women he hath built very fine Houſes, two Courts very ſumptuous; in the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them are ſeventy two Marble Pillars, each at leaſt three foot thick, to ſupport the fine painted Works above; in the middle of the greater Court is a Marble Ciſtern with curious Spring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſprings or boils up in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thereof, and comes from a Fountain about two Miles from the Caſtle. If he deſires to lie with any of his Women, he ſends an Eunuch to fetch whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: ſhe being come, he lies with her, after that he bids her begone; being as inhumane in this as in the reſt of his Actions; and away ſhe goes, leſt he kill her. He allows his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Women a quantity of Flower, and ſends his Eunuchs to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it them out; and ſometimes goes to look over them himſelf, leſt his Eunuchs cheat him. One of his Women came to him carrying a young Child in her Arms, deſiring him to allow her a little more Flower and Butter; he bid her ſtay a while, and ſhe ſhould have it; then he
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000905_0053_0FAC9DB5B0DC3590"/>
called for ſome of his Eunuchs, and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and cauſed them to pull the young Child in pieces Limb from Limb.</p>
            <p>It's his Pleaſure ſometimes to ſhew his Women his fine Buildings: before he goes, he ſends his Eunuchs to drive away all the Men out of their ſight, riding with a Lance himſelf before the Women, being two or three hundred following, where he rides in great Pomp, extolling this and the other Work, and admiting the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thereof: but the Women dare not to ſpeak a word otherwiſe than as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1688, the Emperor of <hi>Morocco</hi> ſent a Letter to the <hi>Algerines,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them that he heard they had a great many Chriſtian Slaves; and ſince he had a great deal of work to do, if they would ſell him any of them, he would give them 150 Dollars a Head for five hundred of them, and ſend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with all ſpeed They gathered three hundred French Men, and brought them to <hi>Tittivan</hi>; being landed there, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour had them to <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> to the Emperor, to ſee them, and asked him if he liked them? who anſwered, Yes.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000905_0054_0FAC9DB624F5E230"/>
Immediately by the Emperor's Order they were driven away by the Negroes in a barbarous manner. The <hi>Algerines</hi> expecting their Money from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, having waited a long time for Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they reſolved at once to demand it from him: When they asked him for it, he anſwered, he did not uſe to give Money for Chriſtians that were brought into his Land. Then they charged him with breach of Promiſe, ſaying, <hi>they hoped he would not ſerve them ſo.</hi> He ſaid, if they did not retire out of his Country, he would cut off all their Heads. So they retiring to <hi>Algier</hi> with ſpeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the King and his Pateroons how they had ſped with the Emperor, giving Relation of what he ſaid concerning the Chriſtians. The King preſently rais'd an Army of 50000 Men, preparing Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Field-pieces, who marched through <hi>Trimſind,</hi> a place at or near the Emperor's Dominions, where they entred without Reſiſtance; and as they paſſed along, ſeveral of <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi>'s People ran to them: <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi>'s Coydes, or Governours, acquainted him that the <hi>Algerines</hi> were coming againſt him:
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000905_0055_0FAC9DB6E348D640"/>
               <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> hearing thereof, raiſed an Army of Eighty thouſand Horſe and Foot, and made his Son <hi>Mully Sedan</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral thereof. Whilſt his Army was a preparing, the <hi>Algerines</hi> were got up as far as a Town called <hi>Tezzo,</hi> within two days Journey of <hi>Fez,</hi> where they pitch'd. <hi>Mully Sedan</hi> went againſt them; &amp; being there, the <hi>Algerines</hi> wrote a Letter to <hi>Mully Iſhmael,</hi> acquainting him, that they did not come to fight with his Son, but to have met himſelf in Perſon: he ſent them word back that his Son was able enough for them. Soon after they had received his Letter, they engaged <hi>Mully Sedan's</hi> Army, and ſlew abundance of them. Many of <hi>Mully Sedan</hi>'s Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple deſerted him, joyning with the <hi>Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines.</hi> Then he ſent with all ſpeed to the Emperor his Father, giving him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what had happened. When <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> underſtood that, he gave out, that if any Chriſtians would help, and ſtand by the great Guns, if he prevailed againſt the <hi>Algerines,</hi> he would give them their Liberty. So eight <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> told him they knew what belonged to the Guns, and they would go with him. So he ordered an hundred <hi>Moors</hi> to aſſiſt them,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000905_0056_0FAC9DB7A1BEA048"/>
and to take out ſix great Guns (that they judged might be moſt ſerviceable) from the place where they lay betwixt the Walls. They told him they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Carriages: He ſent for Carpenters immediately, charging them to make Carriages ſtrong and good, and that with all ſpeed, upon pain of loſing their Heads in caſe they neglected. <hi>Mully Sedan</hi> again ſent the Emperor his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word, that if he did not haſten to Battel, the <hi>Algerines</hi> would be in <hi>Fez,</hi> in four days time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Mully Iſhmael</hi> hearing that, was forced to go with all ſpeed, raiſing what Forces he could, leaving for haſte his Field pieces behind him. The Emperor being come where his own Army lay, he made Peace with the <hi>Algerines</hi> General, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto, gave forty eight Mules laden with Gold, and an Horſe and Furniture worth 200000 Crowns.</p>
            <p>About a month before I came from <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> one of our own Nation, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y <hi>Elias Roberts,</hi> being by the ſaid Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror put to look after a parcel of Sheep he came himſelf to view them; and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, them over, found three of his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000905_0057_0FAC9DB862A969C0"/>
wanting, who thereupon ſent for one of his chief Negroes that kept all account of them, and examined him what was become of them? he replied, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian kept the Key and lock'd them up every Night, and carried it with him to the place where he went to ſleep under Ground. The Tyrant immediately ſent his Blood hounded Negros to fetch the poor Chriſtian, who was not far from them; being come, he asked him what was become of thoſe Sheep that were wanting? he made Anſwer, he went home every Night, having firſt faſtned the Door, and that the Negroe had a falſe. Key to the Door; ſo turning to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe, and upon Examination finding him faulty, he preſently ſhot him to Death, running his Launce through his Body in ſeveral places, and threatned the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an for not acquainting him therewith ſooner, ſaying, if he would not turn <hi>Moor,</hi> he would kill him, as he had done the <hi>Negro,</hi> who lay dead before them. The Chriſtian boldly replied, he was brought up in the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and he would not turn <hi>Moor,</hi> and that he feared God, whoſe Power was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:000905_0058_0FAC9DB922D79610"/>
than his; ſo the Emperor fell to cutting him, and afterwards had him very inhumanely ſtretched out by thoſe bloody Negroes, and beaten till he was left for dead. Then he went away to his Works where Engliſh Captives were, and told them he had killed one of the Dogs their Brother, for taking no better care of his Sheep, calling them Dogs in his, own Language, &amp; bidding them fetch that Dog away; five or ſix of them went and brought the poor Man away, who had been ſo cruelly beaten by the wicked Wretch, his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſo exceedingly bruiſed, he could not ſtir neither hand nor foot; neither could he feed himſelf for ſeveral days, but as we help'd him. Yet through God's Mercy, he was pretty well recovered be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore my Departure from thence. And thus when the poor Captives are by this unmerciful, and rather, as we may term him, inhumane Brute, beaten and killed at his pleaſure, none dare make any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to him; for inſtead of taking any Pity of them, he matters no more to kill a Chriſtian than to kill a Dog; and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſeeks for Favour from this
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000905_0059_0FAC9DB9E21163C8"/>
Tyrant, he's either killed, of ſorely bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by either him or his bloody Negroes.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Moor,</hi> one of the Natives of the Country, having Compaſſion on me, &amp; ſeeing my ſad Condition that I was kept daily in, which I cannot at large inſert here, came to me, ſpeaking his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, being Arabick, knowing I could underſtand him; and he asked me if I would go to my Native Country? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, are you in earneſt or not? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Yes, and would direct me, and go along with me himſelf to <hi>Marſegan,</hi> a Garriſon belonging to the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> I told him, if he expected any Reward or Satisfaction from me for his pains, I had nothing to give him; he ſaid he knew that by my Condition. So I enquired of him where he lived? he anſwered, at a place called <hi>Aſſimore,</hi> which is not far from the Chriſtian Garriſon; and he ſaid, he would truſt to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of the Governour of that place, provided I would ſpeak to the ſaid Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernour for a Gratuity for him, when we ſhould arrive there. I told him I ſhould be worſe than a Jew, if I did not do that; and they themſelves count the Jews
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000905_0060_0FAC9DBAA236B290"/>
the worſt and falſeſt of all People. Then I asked him in what time we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for our Journey? he ſaid, as ſoon as I could find convenient opportunity; &amp; I farther prevailed with him to take in two more Engliſh-men along with us, whoſe Names were <hi>Triſtram Bryan,</hi> born in <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and <hi>Edward Tucker,</hi> who came from <hi>New England.</hi> And in five days time after we were fitted with a ſmall quantity of Bread for the Journey, ſuppoſing we might accompliſh our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in ten nights time, for we muſt of neceſſity hide our ſelves in the Day for fear of being diſcovered; yet we found it difficult enough to perform it in two and twenty days, in which time we were put to great Hardſhips and Neceſſities on the way. The Particulars are as follow.</p>
            <p>On the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1692, in the Evening, we ſet forward from <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> and travelled as far as we could that Night in great fear of being purſued, with our <hi>Moor</hi> to direct us in the way, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if they had found us, we had been killed, if not burnt, which would have been the <hi>Moor</hi>'s Lot had we been taken: towards day we had a great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000905_0061_0FAC9DBB62B9C540"/>
to paſs; when we were got over, we found a ſmall Coppiſe or Wood, where we reſted the Day following, being the 27<hi>th.</hi> In the Evening when the Sun was ſet, our Guide was forward to be going, not knowing how the Event would prove, and I had much ado to perſwade him from going before 'twas dark. When we came into the Road out of the Wood we met ten <hi>Moors,</hi> and Mules and Aſſes laden with Goods for the Emperor, being Iron, which they had taken from one <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage,</hi> an Engliſh Maſter that came from <hi>Bilboa</hi>; ſo we followed our Guide the <hi>Moor,</hi> who gave them the time of the Night, and they him likewiſe; &amp; ſo we paſſed that time without any further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ſuppoſing us to be <hi>Moors,</hi> being we had on their ſort of Apparrel. So we travelled that Night, making what haſte we could, and ſtill in great fear, leſt we ſhould have been diſcovered by <hi>Moors</hi>: when we reſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was towards Day, in ſome Brambles or Buſhes, ſeeing them paſs along by us, driving of Sheep and Bullocks; but through Mercy they did not ſee us. And the next Night, being the 28<hi>th,</hi> we travelled all Night; and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:000905_0062_0FAC9DBC4AF0D7A0"/>
when Day appeared, we could not find a convenient place to lodg in, which we ſought for; and about Sun-riſing we found a place betwixt two Mountains where were Holes made with the Winter Rains coming off the Hills near a Path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to which we made, and eſpied ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Moors</hi> who went along the Road, that had Mules and Aſſes loaden with Iron, who ſaw us not. Some part of the Day we ſlept; and the <hi>Moor</hi> and I watcht; in which time the <hi>Moor</hi> gathered Palm, and made a Sling, to ſling Stones at Lions and other wild Beaſts that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>So in the Evening, after Sunſet, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 29<hi>th</hi>) we travelled till we came to a River-ſide, where were a great parcel of <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Mules</hi> a baiting, that had Bail Goods, which the <hi>Sally Moors</hi> had taken in Prizes, to carry to the Emperor at <hi>Macqueneſs</hi>; who ſtrictly enquired of our <hi>Moor,</hi> from whence we came, and whither we were going? He made anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, To <hi>Salley,</hi> and came from <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> and ſo our <hi>Moor</hi> bad them Goodnight; and we travelled on (without further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry) along the River-ſide before we
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000905_0063_0FAC9DBDA9078658"/>
could get over. When we were over, there were a great many Bramble buſhes and Ruſh-buſhes; and our <hi>Moor</hi> feared there were Lions in that Place, ſo we made what haſte we could up a Hill, on the top of which was a great Plain; and being very thirſty, we travelled on a good way further, and heard a noiſe of Frogs and Toads; to which Place we came, and found a ſtanding Water, which ſtunk; however we drank thereof to ſtay our Thirſt, and 'twas ſweet to us: and ſo went on till we found a ruined Caſtle, which had formerly belonged to the <hi>Portugues,</hi> at which our <hi>Moor</hi> would fain have reſted; but I told him there might happen to be <hi>Moors</hi> there, becauſe they uſually reſted in ſuch Places in the Night. So we came to a place where grew a great parcel of high Weeds, and there we reſted that Day.</p>
            <p>The 30<hi>th</hi> at Night, after Sun ſet, we ſet forwards; but were very thirſty, the Sun haveing ſhone hot upon us that Day, having lain without ſhelter, only the Weeds. I asked our <hi>Moor,</hi> how long it would be e're we could find any Water? He ſaid, A little further there was a ſmall
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000905_0064_0FAC9DBE661BE7B8"/>
River; but we thought it a long way to it, our Throats being ſo parch'd with Drought; ſo we drank Water, and eat a little Bread, which did greatly refreſh us; and we went forward till near break of Day, where we reſted in ſome Weeds till about two in the Afternoon; at which time the three Women diſturbed us two or three times, but ſaw not our Faces. So we three went forward, and our <hi>Moor</hi> ſtood, and enquired of them the way to <hi>Salley.</hi> Then the Women asked from whence we came? Who anſwered, From <hi>Tapholet,</hi> which was a City in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They further asked, if he had lain in that place all Night? and asked what they were that were with him? He told them, Three of his Neighbours, and that they had laid there all Night, being Strangers. They ſaid, It was a wonder that the Lions had not deſtroyed us, there being ſo many in that place, they devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome of their Cattle, almoſt every Night; and they told him it was about four Leagus to <hi>Sally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Sun-ſet (<hi>July</hi> 1.) we travelled till we came to a Wood, where the <hi>Moor</hi> would have had us to reſt; but ſeeing of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000905_0065_0FAC9DBF25B13738"/>
Lights which the Country People had in their Tents, and hearing a Lion roan thereabouts, we went further, and came to a ruined Tower, where was a good Spring of Water; we drank and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves, but durſt not ſtay for fear of <hi>Moors</hi> being in that place; and going a little farther, we came into a Valley, where was a Hole the Winter Rains had made, there we reſted; and after the Sun was riſen, two <hi>Moors</hi> came to cut Palm: At which I awaked our <hi>Moor,</hi> who ſpoke to them, and gave them the time of Day, and they likewiſe to him. They enquired of him from whence he came, and whither he was going? He told them, he came from beyond <hi>Tapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> and was going to viſit a great Saint at a Town called <hi>Temſnah</hi>; and asked further, if there were none with him? He anſwered, there were three more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They asked, if we had lain there all Night? He ſaid, we had; They ſaid, it was to be wondred that the Lions had not devoured us; and came to look at us where we lay, ſpeaking <hi>Arabick</hi>; but the <hi>Moor</hi> told them, we could not ſpeak that <hi>Lingua</hi>; and we were covered all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:000905_0066_0FAC9DBFE2BE5150"/>
with our white Blankets, being ſuch as the <hi>Moors</hi> commonly wear. So they went away and left us, telling us. We did well in going to viſit the Saint. So we got up, and eſpying a parcel of Buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es a little diſtance off, we removed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leſt the two <hi>Moors</hi> ſhould have informed of us at <hi>Sally,</hi> &amp; ſo have come back to the place and found us. The Buſh where we were hid, was near a River-ſide, but we durſt not go to drink thereat, by reaſon of People which paſſed to and fro there by us all-day long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 2. After Sun-ſet, we attempted to go over the River; but it being ſo ſtrong a Stream, and deep, we could not paſs over it: And in our going a great way further up the River-ſide, there happened to be ſeveral of the <hi>Moors</hi>; yet being Night, they ſaw us not, ſave only one Man of the Natives, which had tied up a bundle of Canes faſt together to paſs over the River with them; to whom our <hi>Moor</hi> gave the time of the Night; and he anſwering with the like to us, we parted: and going higher up, we found a place not ſo deep as the other part of the River; ſo got over, and travelled up
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:000905_0067_0FAC9DC0A364D638"/>
a Hill on the other ſide, where we found ſome Buſhes, and there we reſted, and our <hi>Moor</hi> lay on the out-ſide of them. In the Morning when the Sun was riſen, came by us two <hi>Moors</hi> with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Aſſes, who ſaid one to the other, it was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lions had not devoured that Man, meaning our <hi>Moor,</hi> who they ſaw lying by the ſide of the Buſhes.</p>
            <p>On the third Inſtant, after the Sun was ſet, we ſet forward, endeavouring to get to the Sea-ſide: but there being ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral People in the way, watching with their Dogs to keep the wild Beaſts from their Gardens; which we hearing, were fain to flee further from them: ſo we travelled a little further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſome Ruſhes.</p>
            <p>The next Night, being the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> we travelled after Sun ſetting as far as we could, being weary and faint, and reſted.</p>
            <p>On the 5<hi>th</hi>; on which Day after Sun was ſet, we ſet forward and travelled till we came to a place where was a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, being thereto led by a noiſe of Frogs; which although the Water ſtunk, yet drinking thereof, it was ſweet
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:000905_0068_0FAC9DC161B5F1A0"/>
to us; with that, and a little Bread, we were much refreſhed; but at this time our Bread was gone, ſo we travelled a little further, and reſted.</p>
            <p>The 6<hi>th</hi> Inſtant, after Sun-ſet, we went forward, and diſcovered a great many Lights which the Natives had in their Tents where they lodg: So we parted a while one from another, to find out the Roads. At length I came to a place where the Country People uſe to go to Market, where we again met together; and travelling a while, we heard ſome Dogs as I thought, did ſcent us; and near that place we met with a Lion ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the way-ſide; which the <hi>Moor</hi> ſeeing, before he rouſed, he ſtruck him fair over the Head. So the Lion roared at him, and followed us half a mile or more; but our <hi>Moor</hi> kept ſlinging of Stones at him ſo faſt, that he left us. Then we came to a Valley, where was a Wood on each ſide: When Day appeared, we reſted in the Wood, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Bread to ſuſtain us; but we durſt not enter the Wood till it was Day light, for fear of the Lions: We then found a piece of Pot in the Wood,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:000905_0069_0FAC9DC22970DF18"/>
with which our <hi>Moor</hi> brought us ſome Water out of the Valley; for we durſt not fetch it our ſelves, leſt the People ſaw us: ſo when the <hi>Moor</hi> had brought us a pot full of Water, (but in the mean time we were lamenting our ſad Condition for want of Bread, having then no Suſtenance but Palm-Berries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Graſs and Weeds, and any thing we could eat, which was ſweet to us) he ſaid, in his own Language, God was great. So went from us about the ſpace of four Hours; in which time he fold his Saſh, and bought us a ſmall quantity of Bread (about a pound and an half) therewith, and brought us a little of it, which we ate; and he fetch'd us a little more Water in the Pot: After we had eaten and drank of the Water, we went to ſleep, two of us watching.</p>
            <p>On the 7<hi>th,</hi> after Sun ſet, we travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on; and the <hi>Moor</hi> ſlung Stones, whilſt we paſſed through the Wood, leſt there ſhould be Lions lurking therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts: having refreſhed our ſelves with the Bread and Water, we reſted amongſt ſome Brambles, but could find no more Water that Night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:000905_0070_0FAC9DC2E1F4B408"/>Then on the 8<hi>th</hi> Day at Night we came to another Wood, in which we travelled a great way, and kept two of us awake to watch againſt Lions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wild Beaſts.</p>
            <p>On the 9<hi>th</hi> we ſet forward, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in the ſame Wood, and ſtill had no Water.</p>
            <p>The 10<hi>th,</hi> after Sun ſetting, we went till we came to an Hill of Rocks; at the bottom whereof we found a Spring of Water, and drinking thereof, we were greatly refreſhed, and there was a little River, from which we went, till we came to ſome Trees or Buſhes, and there reſted.</p>
            <p>About eight a Clock in the Morning, <hi>July</hi> 11. (it raining faſt) we ventur'd to travel that Day, after we had rubb'd out a little Corn, and eaten, that the <hi>Moor</hi> had brought us, having no Bread to eat: ſo went to the top of an Hill, on which grew a Tree, which we climb'd upon, and eſpied the Sea at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from us. We travelled all that Day, and the Night following, till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Day, that we reſted, but had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bread nor Water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:000905_0071_0FAC9DC3A158E168"/>On the 12<hi>th</hi> at Night, after Sun-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, we travelled a good way, and heard a noiſe of Frogs and Toads; to which we made, and found Water, which we drank of; and although it was very brackiſh, yet it was pleaſant to us, by reaſon of our ſore drought. A little from thence we met with a Perſon of Quality, as we judged by his Habit and Attendance, having ten Men with him; to whom our <hi>Moor</hi> paid his Reſpects, and gave him the time of the Night. He anſwered him again in his own Language and asked him whither we were going? Our <hi>Moor</hi> anſwered, To <hi>Santa Cruſe</hi>: So he bid us God ſpeed: Afterwards our <hi>Moor</hi> asked him from whence he came? He anſwered, From <hi>Aſſimore.</hi> So we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted away, and travelled till we found ſome Buſhes, wherein we reſted that Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 13. After Sun-ſetting we ſet out, and came ſo near to <hi>Aſſimore,</hi> that liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening we heard the People in it, and ſaw the Town, which ſtood on the South ſide of a Hill, and a River by the Town, which was ſo deep, that we could not get over, becauſe one of our Men could not ſwim: Then we travelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:000905_0072_0FAC9DC4752C7128"/>
the North ſide of the River, till we came to a place where Canes grew, and there we reſted by the River-ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 14 After it was Day, our <hi>Moor</hi> went to ſee his Family which dwelt there in that Town. We having been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time without Bread, I requeſted our <hi>Moor</hi> to bring us a little, (which he did) and likewiſe to ſee if he could find any thing to carry my Country man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River; and about four in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon he returned with ſome Bread, and ſaid, he had found a Tree. After Sun was ſet, we went to view it, and found it not fit to ſwim withal: So we returned, and went back to the Canes, and there ſtaid.</p>
            <p>On the 15<hi>th</hi> Inſtant, when the Sun was riſen, I deſired our <hi>Moor</hi> to go and enquire of the People, where we might paſs over the River? The People told him, there was no other Paſſage but by a Boat at the Town. So our <hi>Moor</hi> went about a League further in the Country, where he ſaw a Man and a Woman up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Mule croſſing the River, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the place with ſome Stones, that we might find it, and ſo returned to us, and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:000905_0073_0FAC9DC527966258"/>
reſted till Sun ſetting. So we ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and had gone but a little way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we heard a Lion roar, but he did not come in our ſight; then we came to the place where the <hi>Moor</hi> laid his Mark, and ſat down to conſult how to paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there, we hearing of People in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den were near at hand: And in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, we heard a Lion juſt behind us; ſo we haſtened and got over the River, and travelled a little further, &amp; reſted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 16. After Sun ſetting we travelled about a Mile further, where we ſaw a Town, that our <hi>Moor</hi> ſaid was a Saint's Town, to which the People, that were not able to pay their Taxes to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, fled for Refuge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 17. After Sun ſetting we travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and going till about Midnight we came within call of the Garriſon <note n="*" place="bottom">The diſtance between <hi>Macqueneſs</hi> and <hi>Merſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> being two hundred Miles or more; but travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Night, occaſioned our miſſing the Way: ſo that we went at leaſt three hundred Miles before we came to the Garriſon.</note> which was at <hi>Merſygan</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>: So I called out, and the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:000905_0074_0FAC9DC5E283E060"/>
Souldiers made anſwer to me, and asked what we were? I replied, we were three Chriſtians and a <hi>Moor</hi>: which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently acquainted the Governour of, and bid us haſten nearer, leſt there ſhould be any <hi>Moors</hi> in the hearing of us. Which we did, and running to a wrong place, they called to us again to make to the two Draw bridges, where we ſat down. So the Governour, and the reſt of the Officers, came to the Wall; and after he had examined us, he and the Guard let us in; and he ordered his Servants to bring us into the Houſe, and to give us ſome Relief; and he himſelf came to us, and wondred that ſo little ſatisfied us in our eating and drinking: So had us into another Room, and asked me, If I did not know of three Men that were taken by the <hi>Moors</hi> from that Garriſon? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I knew of two, but not the third. He bid me ſpeak to the <hi>Moor,</hi> and ask him, if he would undertake to bring them thither to that place? So I ſpoke to the <hi>Moor,</hi> who bid me tell the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he would endeavour it to the utmoſt of his Power. So the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ordered us a Lodging; and in
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:000905_0075_0FAC9DC6A16CDAB0"/>
the Morning ordered his Clerk to write a couple of Letters, and gave them to the <hi>Moor,</hi> with forty pieces of Eight for bringing us thither, ſaying, If he did bring the two Portugueſs, he would give him as much more as ſhould maintain him and his Family as long as he lived. The <hi>Moor</hi> ſaid, He would do his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. So the Governour ordered Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for us: And about four a Clock he again ſent for me and the <hi>Moor</hi>; and bid me tell him in his Language, That if he feared any thing in his Return, he would ſend ſome of his Troopers to conduct him on the Way. The <hi>Moor</hi> made anſwer, He ſhould go more ſafe alone. After Sun was ſet, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gave him Victuals to ſerve him, till he could ſhift for himſelf. And the <hi>Moor</hi> taking his leave, returned, and went on his Journey.</p>
            <p>About three Weeks after, a Portugueſe Man of War came into that Garriſon, to fetch about 1800 Souldiers off from thence: So I deſired of the Governour we might go aboard with them: Which he was willing, and in four days after we had been aboard, moſt of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000905_0076_0FAC9DC7632690D0"/>
being come off, the Captain ſent a Letter to the Governour, by the Coxon of the Pinnace, deſiring him to haſten he remainder away. When the Pinnace went aſhore, his Crew wondred to ſee any <hi>Moors</hi> there, and asked, What they did there? The Portugues told them, They came with a Flag of Truce, to treat for three <hi>Moors</hi> they had taken. They offered the Governour two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Dollars for them, being one of them was a Shack, or Governour; or Bullocks, or Sheep, or Corn, in lieu of Money. He anſwered, No; for they had taken three Troopers belonging to his Garriſon; and he heard that two of them were at <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> They replied, They knew by whom he heard that, for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that the <hi>Moor</hi> brought, had acquainted him therewith; but he had paid dearly for it, for, ſaid they, he was taken with the Pieces of Eight, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters about him, and carried up to the Emperor and burnt: At which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was very ſorry when he heard it The Governour then told them, he heard two of his Troopers were alive at <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> but he feared the third was
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000905_0077_0FAC9DC82232EDB8"/>
dead, becauſe he heard nothing of him; and bid them go up to the Emperor, and prevail with him, if they could, for the two <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and bring them, and they ſhould have the three <hi>Moors.</hi> They told him, they could not do that. He made anſwer, Then they ſhould never have the <hi>Moors.</hi> So at Night when they came on Board, I asked them what was the beſt News? Who ſaid, Very bad; for they had ſeen a parcel of <hi>Moors,</hi> who had given account to the Governour, that the <hi>Moor</hi> that brought us to the Garriſon was taken and burnt. At which I was much grieved, knowing the poor <hi>Moor's</hi> true hearredneſs towards us, in bringing and directing us on our Journey, when we made our eſcape from <hi>Macqueneſs.</hi> So ſetting fail for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> through God's Mercy we ſafely arrived there, and went to the King's Palace, giving him Thanks for the Kindneſs the Governour had be ſtowed upon us, and the <hi>Moor</hi> that brought us to the Garriſon.</p>
            <p>When we came thither, ſeveral of the Nobility enquired of us, What Nation we were of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and told us, if we deſired it, we might ſpeak with the King; and
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:000905_0078_0FAC9DC8E1E89A60"/>
acquainted him of us, who ordered us to come before him; and enquired of us if we could ſpeak French or Portugueſe? I ſaid, we could ſpeak ſome <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and a little <hi>Lingua Franc</hi>: So he enquired from whence we came? And I gave him account of our narrow eſcape from that Slavery we had been in under the Emperor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and told him how our Bread was gone in ten days time, and that we had been two and twenty Days in coming from <hi>Macqueneſs,</hi> to the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and did eat nothing but Reach till the 23<hi>d</hi> Night. He much wondred how we were kept alive the reſt of the time after our Bread was gone. I told him, through God's Aſſiſtance we had ſhifted as well as we could; for our Liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweet to us, had cauſed us to run theſe great hazards we were expoſed to. He further enquired after thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that are ſtill in Slavery; of which I gave him an Account of all I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member: And deſired him, out of the abundance of his Goodneſs and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to remember them in their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. He told me, it was more than he ever heard before, and ſaid, he would
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:000905_0079_0FAC9DC9A1935258"/>
before Winter came, take care to ſend them Relief, to buy them Victuals and Cloaths; and enquired of me, Whether any of his Subjects deſired me to lay their Condition before him? I anſwered, No, but (by God's permiſſion) I had in part undergone the ſame Afflictions they were in, and knew well enough how it was with them. He made anſwer, God would bleſs me for it. He likewiſe ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if I knew what number of Ships were at <hi>Salley?</hi> I cold him, eleven Sail. He ſaid, He knew <hi>Venetia,</hi> for he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been at his Palace I ſaid, it was our late King <hi>Jame's</hi> Pleaſure to give him his Liberty; with much more that paſſed betwixt us.</p>
            <p>When this <hi>Venitia</hi> returned home to the Emperor, the Emperor ordered him to build a Ship; &amp; ſeveral Engliſh men, that were newly taken Slaves he cauſed to draw Timber in a Cart from <hi>Memora</hi> to <hi>Salley,</hi> (which was twelve Miles diſtant) like ſo many Oxen, driving and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of them in a very barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Name of <hi>Venetia</hi> cauſed me to inſert this here, to ſhow the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

Cruelty of this inhumane Wretch; and ſo I ſhall leave him, and proceed.</p>
            <p>We having taken our leaves here, took our Paſſage for <hi>Holland,</hi> where my two Country-men ſtaid; but I took my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for <hi>England,</hi> where, praiſed be God for his great Mercies, I arrived ſafely, being by his good Providence at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from under the Hands of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Tyrant, and his Helliſh Crew of Negroes; beſeeching Almighty God, that all my Country men, in all their Affairs and Negotiations, may ever eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from his cruel Hands.</p>
