            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And <hi>at what</hi> inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it: If it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS paſſage of ſacred writ is peculiarly adapted to infant ſtates. From hence, and the two verſes next proceeding, we collect the general rule of the divine allotments towards political combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—what will, on the one hand, aſſuredly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from the brink of ruin—what may, on the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and, prevent their exaltation when favorable proſpects open upon them.</p>

THE preſent hour in the ſanctuary will accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly be devoted to a ſubject, which may at no time hereafter be ſo ſeaſonable. And the candour of this venerable auditory is relied on, while I offer ſome ſketches on the providence of GOD in the riſe and fall of empires—the veſtiges of it encouraging us that the American confederacy may be built up—the obligations of a people for whom great things have been done, and upon whom ſuch proſpects are opening—the danger, in our circumſtances, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on the ſmiles of heaven, and the quarters from which this danger is to be apprehended.</p>
            <p>THE near relation theſe things have to the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our public affairs will apologize for my not calling your attention ſo particularly to the origin of government—the ends of magiſtracy—the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a good ruler—and the duty of ſubjects.</p>
            <p>FIRST, The governing providence of GOD is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed—a doctrine clear from the neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of creatures—the uniform courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſpecial interpoſitions—implied in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a revelation. GOD'S government is alike manifeſt in the natural and moral world. To a Being of infinite perfection all things are alike eaſy. It is, moreover, of great moment, that the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the SOVEREIGN of the univerſe be conſidered as guided by unerring wiſdom, and immutable holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs. In this view our ſubject repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it. And hence it is equally the object of fear, pious reſignation, filial joy and confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:016252_0006_0F9BCFE119DB27E8"/>
THIS doctrine, the foundation of natural religion, revealed illuſtrates. <q>The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over all. Promotion cometh neither from the caſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth, but GOD is judge: He pulleth down one, and ſetteth up another. His <hi>counſel ſhall ſtand.</hi>
               </q> It is in his family, the univerſe, as <hi>in a great houſe,</hi> wherein <hi>are veſſels not only of gold and ſilver; but alſo of wood and of earth; and ſome to honor, and ſome to diſhonor:</hi>—Words which, however immediately intended, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to different orders in a civil communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the rank different kingdoms hold among their neighbors. Some are ſtrong, and others weak; ſome are above, and others beneath; ſome are the head, and others the tail.<note n="†" place="bottom">2. TIM. ii. 20. DRUT. xxviii. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>WHATEVER inſtruments are employed in building and planting kingdoms, the divine hand is to be ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately eyed. <hi>All power is of God.</hi> HE raiſeth up, as well as removeth, <q>the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prudent, the counſellor, the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator,</q> who, in different ways, contribute to the exaltation of their people. To HIM are to be aſcribed their abilities, the time of their coming on the ſtage to aſſert the rights of their country and mankind, their ſphere of action, the acceptance of their ſervices, and term of their uſefullneſs. And to whom but HIM, who turneth the hearts of an whole people as the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016252_0007_0F9BCFE1D3A261E8"/>
hearts of one man, ſhall we attribute the union of public bodies? the concurrence and ſtrenuous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all ranks for the common ſafety?</p>
            <p>THE ſame Being turneth wiſe men backward, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides public councils, ſends civil diſcord into king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, defeats military enterprizes however well concerted, and fills with terror thoſe who ſeemed to be made without fear. <q>At thy rebuke, O GOD of Jacob, the ſtout-hearted are ſpoiled, and none of the men of might find their hands. Thou cutteſt off the ſpirit of princes, and art terrible to the kings of the earth. The wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee; the remainder of wrath ſhall thou reſtrain.</q> Good rulers are <hi>his miniſters for good.</hi> Cruel tyrants are <hi>the rod of his anger.</hi> 
               <q>I have created the waſter to deſtroy. The MOST HIGH ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will, and SETTETH UP OVER IT THE BASEST OF MEN.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE things imply no other divine influence than conſiſts with the moral perfections of the DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ITY and human liberty. <hi>Far be it from</hi> GOD <hi>that he ſhould do wickedly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF it is aſked, Why doth not GOD govern the world without the inſtrumentality of ſubordinate agents? As well might it be aſked, Why did he not determine to ſave the world without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of a mediator? With reſpect to both it ſhould ſatisfy us, that <hi>ſo it ſeemeth good in his fight.</hi>
            </p>

"AT what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and concerning a kingdom, to <hi>build</hi> and to <hi>plant</hi> it." From what veſtiges of providence may we infer, that this language comes addreſſed to us? It were to be wiſhed that this SECOND enquiry could be anſwered by referring to the traces of a real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. This would be the ſtrongeſt aſſurance of the continuance and enlargement of our liberties. But, O America! <hi>ſaved of the</hi> LORD, <hi>haſt thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted more and more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DIVINE providence doth not precipitate events: There is an harmony in its diſtributions. Bodies politic, like the body natural, have their periods of growing to maturity and decay. Some States go to decay ſooner than others, as ſome perſons haſten on themſelves a premature old age by various exceſſes. But judging from analogy, is it to be ſuppoſed, ill-deſerving as we are, that the deſolation of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is near? a country reſcued more than once in circumſtances ſeemingly deſperate. From the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our cauſe, paſt ſalvations, and preſent proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, may we not hope, that for <hi>his own name's ſake</hi> the GOD of our fathers will make known his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſight of all nations by humbling our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors?</p>
            <p>WE cannot look into futurity. This is HIS pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative who <hi>ſeeth the end from the beginning.</hi> But we call to mind his wonders of old. When our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſought a retreat from oppreſſion, he made a path for them through the ſea and furniſhed them a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016252_0009_0F9BCFE4D0ECEE78"/>
table in the wilderneſs. When few in number, ſtrangers in the land, and encompaſſed by ſavage enemies—when help was far off, he drove out the heathen with his hand, increaſed our fathers, and cauſed the fear of them to fall on the enemy. The hand which planted, hath hitherto protected, this vine—at no time more remarkably, perhaps, than in our own. Events ſo conſpicuous, ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all human foreſight, as thoſe we have been witneſſes to in this war, muſt impreſs ſuch as diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the common courſe of providence. Permit me to mention in this view the debility of the country when the war began—the ſteps by which it hath collected ſtrength and firmneſs—the flow progreſs of the enemy—ſtores taken from them or brought us from abroad—altogether unexpected internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources (fruits of inventive neceſſity)—the ſucceſs of our military operations where we leſt expected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, when and where we were ready to deſpair—the fruſtration of them when a ſpirit of confidence poſſeſſed us—the interference of foreign powers—the humiliating circumſtances to which our potent enemies are reduced. Such a number and variety of marvellous events ſeldom take place in an age. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, and will obſerve theſe things; even they ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the</hi> LORD.</p>
            <p>WE are brought to an AERA as remote from our wiſhes, as it was from our expectation, till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtruggle. We aimed at nothing more than a conſtitutional connection with Britain. But he who is wonderful in counſel hath ſpoken, (and we cannot
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016252_0010_0F9BCFE597EA8B18"/>
but <hi>obey his voice</hi>) that we need not <hi>go over the ſea</hi> for law. <q>The MOST HIGH divideth to the nations their inheritance, and ſeparateth the ſons of Adam, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the bounds of their habitation.</q> His providence, ſtep by ſtep, hath called us to aſſume an independent rank among the nations. May the new empire, the foundation of which, under the conduct of his over-ruling hand, is already laid, be built up, ſo as to ſecure public liberty to America as long as the ſun and moon ſhall endure. May the example <hi>provoke to emulation</hi> the numerous kingdoms, from which arbitrary ſway hath long ſince deforced this ineſtimable bleſſing.</p>
            <p>THE powers of the human mind are not exerted, or known, till neceſſity calls them forth.

            <p>A CONFEDERACY between free ſtates, as the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, may have advantages ſuperior to any civil eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment. <q>If a republic is ſmall, it is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a foreign force; if it be large, it is ruined by an internal imperfection.

            <p>THE love of GOD is <hi>the firſt and great commandment;</hi> the love of our neighbor <hi>the ſecond,</hi> and like unto it. Such is the ſimilarity and connection between theſe two commandments, that <q>he who loveth not his brother, whom he hath ſeen, cannot love GOD,

            <p>THE only form of government expreſly inſtituted by heaven was that of the Hebrews. Their's was a confederate republic with JEHOVAH at the head. It conſiſted of twelve diſtinct ſtates; each ſovereign in the adminiſtration of juſtice within itſelf, while their councils and force were united in whatever concerned them all. Their conſtitution was moſt friendly to public liberty. For beſides the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the reſpective ſtates on each other, and their confederacy as one kingdom for the better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their common and particular rights, in this divinely inſtituted polity public truſts were not hereditary, nor had they any revenue to ſupport the officers of government in affluence. Equality of condition was provided for, and the means of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption prevented, by the agrarian law, prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of money on uſury, releaſe of ſervants and deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and return of eſtates in the jubilee.

            <p>FROM the natural parity of mankind it clearly follows, that all ſovereignty is ultimately in the people, or their repreſentatives. They may, at any time, regulate the ſucceſſion, limit the ſovereign, or aboliſh kingly government. Different forms of government are adapted to different people and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. The only view in which one form is preferable to another, is, the greater proſpect of an impartial adminiſtration under it. For this reaſon we give the preference to a repreſentative democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. We may be prejudiced by education. Our preſent ſufferings from an oppreſſive power may have ſtrengthned thoſe prejudices. But all hiſtory aſſures us, that when the powers of government have been lodged with a ſingle perſon the care of the public has not been the object of purſuit. He has been content with meaſures that will laſt out his own time. Or if his views have extended fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it has been to compleat a ſyſtem of tyranny. Nor hath it been otherwiſe, when the deciſion of all affairs has been engroſſed by a few, and theſe not dependent on their people. But in the form we ſpeak of, a ſpirit of love and union is promoted by mediocrity of circumſtances—a ſpirit of envy and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016252_0019_0F9BCFEDE00B79D8"/>
jealouſy is prevented. Public employments are not lucrative—they require application they are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable. Here merit is more generally diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Every individual conſiders himſelf, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the community, as a perſon of ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificance. The loweſt have free acceſs to the chief magiſtrate. Such a form of government is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual cheek to that inſupportable pride and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ambition, which have ſlain millions. People are better ſatisfied with public meaſures when their rulers have a common intereſt with them, and are led by their connections, attachments, and a ſenſe of dependence to care for the ſtate. Popular diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will take place on ſome occaſions. But if groundleſs, it is ſoon appeaſed by the timely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome wiſe and prudent perſon. If well founded, the people know their rulers are ready to hear their complaints—will admit a conviction of any miſtakes, and, upon conviction, rectify them. Or if they perſiſt in meaſures hurtful to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, they can be diſplaced. However a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar government has been reproached, it will be found on enquiry leſs ſubject to threatning inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections than the other forms.</p>
            <p>ONE ſuch government at leaſt may be named, in which inſurrections have rarely taken place, and never proceeded to any deſperate lengths. Were there any ſuch thing on earth, the government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to might be propoſed as a model of a perfect commonwealth. It is indeed a ſingular example. The legiſlative body have from the beginning done
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016252_0020_0F9BCFEEA1511550"/>
the higheſt honour to popular elections, and ſhewn the entire ſafety and wiſdom of an annual choice. There can be no danger from frequent elections, while thoſe in authority are tender of the rights of the community. When they are not ſo, ought elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to return but ſeldom to ſecure them in place? In the commonwealth I ſpeak of, a generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the public liberties in the legiſlature, and reſpect for authority in the people, have happily united. It's exertions on all public occaſions, in the preſent war eſpecially, have placed in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing light the advantages of a repreſentative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy. We truſt there will never be occaſion to ſay, that it's order and happineſs hitherto have not been owing to the ſpirit of liberty and parity of circumſtances, but to the <hi>check</hi> it has been under from Britain. If it's own wiſdom and virtue had not heretofore, as well as more lately, guarded it's rights, that check, inſtead of defending, would have abridged them.

THERE may, we grant, be equality in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme.

Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints may be indulged without reaſon. It is true, notwithſtanding, that the body of a people much oftner acquieſce in wrong meaſures, and bear bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens which cannot righteouſly be laid upon them, than complain without reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <q>BUT the dignity of government ſhould be maintained.</q> True. They who watch for the public weal are entitled to eſteem and an honorable ſupport. <hi>Deſpiſers of government</hi> are dangerous men in any ſtate. There is, however, a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good government and bad. Nor is the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of government to be maintained by relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on demand, immunities conferred on us by the GOD of nature and grace, recognized by the laws of ſociety, and which we are commanded by the higheſt authority to ſtand faſt in. The dignity of government depends not leſs on the wiſdom and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it's adminiſtration, than on the reverence and ſubmiſſion of the governed.</p>
            <p>AMONG the various cauſes which have brought ſlavery on a free people, a laviſh diſtribution of the public treaſure hath not been the leaſt. Hence ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers have riſen to independence, and ſubverted the liberties they were appointed to defend. Inſtead of making the public burthens lighter, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed them. The body of mankind riſe up early,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016252_0022_0F9BCFF011AA6E30"/>
and ſit up late, to toil for a ſcanty ſubſiſtence; while the greater part of their earnings is conſumed on the pride and vanity, the ſloth diſſipation and luxury of a few. Behold the tears of the oppreſſed in various parts of the earth. They cry out of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and wrong without redreſs—<hi>Redreſs,</hi> did I ſay! Even a groan in their bondage is deemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, and not uttered but at the hazard of life. An opulent magiſtracy have proved the bane of the ſtate, as an opulent clergy have of the church.</p>
            <p>WHILE juſtice conſtrains me to ſay this, it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requires a caution againſt a ſpirit of impatience and inſolence under the adminiſtration of rulers who <hi>ſeek the wealth of their people.</hi> Their vigilance, their unwearied attempts for their country, eſpecially at a time when it's liberties are in imminent danger, demand the warmeſt acknowledgments and ready concurrence of the community. Gratitude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt oblige a people to ſay, <hi>We will be with you; be of good courage, and do it.</hi> Government may loſe the reſpect it claims by an ill judged parſimony. Hence the firſt places in it may be filled by men of low talents, or no fixed principles.</p>
            <p>THE beſt ſecurity of any government is the love of it diffuſed through all ranks. In order to this <hi>lenity</hi> muſt be it's characteriſtic. Wide is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between an eaſtern DESPOT, like <hi>a roaring lion and ranging bear over a poor people;</hi> and a ruler who is the FATHER of his ſubjects <hi>ſcattering the wicked with his eyes,</hi> in whoſe <hi>days the righteous flouriſh. When
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016252_0023_0F9BCFF0D79B80B8"/>
the ear heareth him, it bleſſeth him; and when the eye ſeeth him, it gives witneſs to him.</hi> In conducting a ſtate, as in a family, ſeverity may procure a forced ſubmiſſion for a time; but, on the whole, renders authority weak and precarious. Hence many and rigorous penal laws are to be avoided. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the diſtinction of crimes—eradicate the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ingenuity and ſhame—beget a ſlaviſh ſpirit—and muſt end in anarchy or deſpotiſm. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying penal laws, like that of oaths, deſtroys the force of them. Lenity is peculiarly the character of the divine government. The ſupreme ruler of the world <hi>delighteth in mercy.</hi> Puniſhment is his <hi>ſtrange work.</hi> Now the nearer any human go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is conformed to this pattern, the more perfect.</p>
            <p>WE go on to ſay, ſimplicity of manners condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to build a ſtate. Such a people are, for the moſt part, active, hardy and brave—jealous of their rights—united in their councils—fruitful in reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces—fixed in their purpoſe, unawed by the threats or ravages of tyrants: Yea, theſe rouſe them to greater exploits.</p>
            <p>THE principal riches of a ſtate conſiſt in the fruits of the field. Special attention is therefore due to the condition of the huſbandman.</p>
            <p>ADD to this, the encouragement of manufactures—for which there will be further occaſion as the country ſhall populate; and which may be much
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016252_0024_0F9BCFF192FDD100"/>
facilitated by inviting induſtrious and virtuous fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to ſettle among us.</p>
            <p>FINALLY: A government which gives due en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſchools and public worſhip hath every way the advantage of one that neglects them, in regard of civil order and happineſs. This is eaſily ſeen from comparing them together. An early cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in human knowledge, and inſtruction in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are important objects—a like neceſſary to build up a people. The immediate civil advantages of them, regard to poſterity, and to the SOVEREIGN of the univerſe, who diſpenſeth to communities in this world according to their character, enforce them upon us. The oath of GOD can no longer be the bond of ſociety, than the public acknowledgment of him is upheld. It is given as part of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of one of the beſt rulers, that he <hi>ſpake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the</hi> LORD. If the miniſters of religion invade the province of the magiſtrate, or aſſume dominion over the faith of chriſtians, or are needleſly involved in ſecular affairs, or lead a life of idleneſs, diſſipation and ſenſuality, let them be deſpiſed. If the goſpel hath an unfriendly aſpect on civil ſociety—or if any individual can be injured in his chriſtian liberty by being required to uphold it in ſuch public form as he ſhall chuſe, then let the LORD'S-day, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of religion be neglected.

LOVE of our country, love of liberty, are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions much uſed by many who are moſt paſſionate <hi>lovers of their own ſelves.</hi> They have not failed to improve the opportunities of oppreſſing their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and country, at a time when all orders have been called, in a peculiar manner, to cultivate that charity which <hi>ſeeketh not her own.</hi> Nothing more than <hi>liberty</hi> hath been <hi>uſed for a cloke of maliciouſneſs.</hi> This hath prejudiced many againſt the cauſe of America.

AN elegant writer reſembles ſuch changes in rich and luxurious ſtates to that in the fine country round VESUVIUS on an eruption of that fiery mountain. "While the inhabitants are ſunk in voluptuouſneſs, while all is ſmiling round them, and they think that no evil, no danger is nigh, the ſeeds of deſtruction are fermenting within; and breaking out on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, lay waſte all their opulence, all their delights; till they are left a ſad monument of divine wrath, and of the fatal effects of internal corruption."</p>
            <p>VOLUPTUOUSNESS, pride, and contempt of religion and providence are the natural growth of opulence and military ſucceſs. In theſe reſpects the ſin of our enemies <hi>is written with a pen of iron, and with the print of a diamond.</hi> For theſe they are now threatned as in v. 7. of the context. MENE, TEKEL, if not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>on the walls of the palace</hi> of GEORGE THE THIRD, at leaſt ſeems legible on his <hi>councils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PUBLIC crimes not only prevent the good, which providence may intend a community; but ſooner or later meet ſignal vengeance. <hi>Becauſe they regard not the work of the</hi> LORD, <hi>nor the operation of his hands, he ſhall deſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi> May we learn from the example of others, not from our own experience, the conſequences of unamending wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. We ſee our danger. If our caution is awakened, <hi>it may be a lengthening of our tranquillity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR the age of this country we are, perhaps, as degenerate as any people—eſpecially conſidering
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016252_0030_0F9BCFF7A9A112F0"/>
the errand of our anceſtors hither, and our privileges and deliverances. Profligate manners, during the preſent war, have <hi>run and been glorified.</hi> Is it not to be feared, that as we multiply, and extend our commerce, a vain magnificence, the luſt of power, ſenſuality, and contempt of all principles of religion and virtue will be imported in as large cargoes as foreign commodities? Should this be the caſe, it would deſtroy the freedom for which we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured many years ſevere conflict.</p>
            <p>WE may image to ourſelves the future glory of theſe riſing ſtates from <hi>the abundance of the ſea</hi> flowing in to them—a rapid population—a vaſt wilderneſs turned into a fruitful field—a reſpectable navy—a well diſciplined militia—the progreſs of ſcience—and the eſtabliſhment of an empire on ſuch liberal and ſtable principles, that, humanly ſpeaking, it may defy all foreign aſſaults.</p>
            <p>BUT while one imagines this delightful ſcene rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to open, a melancholy gloom comes over the mind. Methinks I ſee profuſion and luxury com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in like a flood—corruption and bribery invading all ranks—public meaſures carried by influence—houſes of worſhip forſaken, or frequented only by few—the public ſupport of religion withheld, and it's miniſters deſpiſed—the LORD'S day devoted to amuſements—family devotion almoſt univerſally laid aſide—revealed religion generally diſbelieved—the preſent infamy wiped off from the vices of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and uncleanneſs—our children early
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016252_0031_0F9BCFF855A77CD0"/>
taught to ſet their mouths againſt the heavens—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal revenge demanded for an inadvertant ſpeech, or little indignity, and the demand gratified—laws againſt ſuch crimes, but dormant, and therefore to all intents repealed.</p>
            <p>WE may not on a ſudden, but gradually, reach this pitch of degeneracy. Would to GOD there were no grounds for ſuch apprehenſions. Pardon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable hearers, the mention of them. Theſe evils may be more eaſily prevented than eradicated. Could we perſuade the riſing generation to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our fears and ſtruggle—Could we make poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty feel the diſtreſſes we endure to eſtabliſh freedom, virtue and religion—Could we ſpeak to future times, and make them ſhun the vices which have ruined other ſtates, after their eſcape from and triumph over, moſt dangerous enemies, it would be well. But ſhould we, and thoſe that come after us, learn the principles and manners which have deſtroyed kingdoms, what can we expect but to ſhare the ſame fate? Will not the governor of the world <hi>viſit for theſe things?</hi> How applicable is the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, referring to the redemption of the Jews from Babyloniſh ſlavery? <q>After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſſes, ſeeing that thou our GOD haſt puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve, and haſt given us ſuch deliverance as this: Should we again break thy commandments?—wouldeſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping?

            <p>THE events of the war need not be rehearſed. <hi>Hitherto the</hi> LORD hath helped us.

The providence of GOD ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016252_0033_0F9BCFF9EDAB0270"/>
preſerved and honored him at his firſt entrance on the ſtage of action. At the call of his country he hath ſacrificed domeſtic quiet and affluence. To his wiſdom, unſkaken fortitude, and univerſal reſpect, it is greatly owing, under providence, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, after four years exertions <hi>to pluck up, pull down, and deſtroy</hi> are themſelves reduced to greater ſtraits than in any foreign war.

Having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the power of the oppreſſor, may he be further prevented with the bleſſings of goodneſs, and at length ſhare in the reward of thoſe who are <hi>more than conquerers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE time would fail me barely to mention other public characters entitled to the acknowledgment of their country. There is <hi>one,</hi> however, which I may not paſs in ſilence—One who, like a ſkillfull pilot, has taken the helm, and conducted the ſhip ſafe in a tempeſtuous ſeaſon—whoſe unremitting applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a variety of public buſineſs, without the leaſt confuſion, beſpeak a great mind—whoſe vigor and diſpatch, joined with the prudence and ſtability of years, adorn an exalted ſtation—who is accepted of the multitude of his brethren, and deſervedly held in higheſt eſtimation in neighbouring ſtates. We account it among the inſtances of the ſignal favor of ALMIGHTY GOD to this ſtate, that he hath given us ſuch a governor in this trying day, and ſuſtained him under the extraordinary cares of government, ſo that <hi>he hath labored, and hath not fainted.</hi>

            <p>YOUR EXCELLENCY and HONORS will indulge me, at a juncture ſo intereſting, in the moſt explicit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of ſeveral things belonging to our peace.</p>
            <p>IN theſe times of convulſion authority hath loſt much of that reſpect which is due to it. This may
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:016252_0036_0F9BCFFC120D8948"/>
be accounted for without the ſuppoſition of weakneſs or unfaithfulneſs in the rulers, or turbulence in the people. Experience muſt inform the ſtateſman what public meaſures are ſalutary. In America's preſent conteſt meaſures heretofore untried were called for: Many which have been gone into, have had happy effects: Some upon trial have been found unadapted; or their novelty hath prevented their being carried into execution. Theſe reaſons have rendered a repeal of ſeveral acts of the legiſlature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Frequent inſtances of this kind tend to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a regard to authority. Men muſt be gradually prepared to receive ſalutary laws. In politicks, as in religion, many things are beneficial, which they cannot bear at preſent. <q>Some diſorders may gain ſo great an aſcendant in a ſtate, that to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a reformation of them at ſuch a time, would only diſcover the weakneſs of the magiſtrates and laws; as there are diſeaſes in which medicines would only haſten death.</q> There was never a ſounder maxim than that lately advanced by a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy prelate. <hi>The art of government conſiſts in not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning too much.</hi> Few laws, dictated by wiſdom, drawn up with ſimplicity, and faithfully executed, beſt ſupport the dignity of government. Your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to reſtore authority from it's preſent relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will meet the concurrence of all reaſonable men—all well wiſhers to their country. The miſeries of anarchy would exceed thoſe we have withſtood at an amazing hazard. Our enemies flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that internal diviſions and confuſion will ſoon deſtroy our independence. We wiſh they may be
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016252_0037_0F9BCFFCD333D138"/>
diſappointed—that as general diſtreſs hath united ſtates very different in their conſtitution and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they may, when the common danger ſhall be removed, guard againſt ſo fatal an evil as licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">A good magiſtrate will not "flatter people in their follies, nor comply with their paſſions againſt their true intereſts and his own judgment. By a wiſe moderation he will raiſe their ſpirits when they are too low, and ſhew them their danger when they grow too preſumptuous. Not ſatisfied with governing wiſely for his own time, he leaves the government in ſuch a ſtate, that no others ſhall have the power of abuſing their truſt, and hurting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public."</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT is of much importance, that thoſe who are in commiſſion for the peace, with whom it lies to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the laws and order thro' the ſtate, be men of known abilities, firmneſs and prudence; otherwiſe they will weaken government ſtill more. We truſt that in theſe appointments our civil fathers will have regard to <hi>the beſt gifts.</hi> And yet there is <hi>a more excellent way,</hi> the <hi>application</hi> of men's talents being of more conſequence than the <hi>luſtre</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>IF any efficacious meaſures for the free courſe of commutative juſtice can be deviſed, it will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.

            <p>CHRISTIAN paſtors, with the concurrence of the legiſlature, may be greatly inſtrumental in forming the principles and manners of their country. Would they build it up, they will not deſire affluence or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power. Their ambition will be to diſplay that meekneſs, contentment, moderation and abſtracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the world; that concern for the higheſt intereſts of their fellow-men, which ſo engagingly recommend the example of their LORD. They will ſerve their country by inculcating a public ſpirit and principles of liberty—proteſting equally againſt civil and ſpiritual tyranny—recommending ſobriety and frugality, obedience to magiſtrates, and a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life in all godlineſs and honeſty—and by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimony againſt profuſion, diſſipation and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs. They will doubtleſs have occaſion to unite againſt the avowed enemies of the chriſtian religion. For the prevalence of diſſolute manners naturally leads to infidelity in principle. <hi>Men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> It will, perhaps, be the beſt method with ſuch men, as they aſſert chriſtianity to be a forgery, to call upon them to ſhew when the forgery was introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—by whom—and by what means it gained ground.</p>

This alſo is deſcribed in the ſame place. <q>Who then is that faithful and wiſe ſteward, whom his LORD ſhall make ruler over his houſhold, to give them their portion of meat in due ſeaſon?
