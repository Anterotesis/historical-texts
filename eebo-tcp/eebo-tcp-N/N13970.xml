         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I AM</hi> not going to aſcribe to you a miracle. I renounce enthuſiaſm, and think too highly of your underſtanding to inſult it by flattery. But, ſo far as <hi>ſecond</hi> cauſes may be neceſſary to fulfil the fiat of the firſt, in the government of human affairs, I do, in the moſt ſolemn manner, believe, you were the means of ſaving me, in the ſummer of <hi>1779</hi> from death.</p>
                  <p>Prior to the event which procured me the benefit of your advice, it had been my chief pleaſure to compoſe the volumes which now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach you. Struck by an uncommon tenderneſs in the circumſtances, whereon the work is founded, I wiſhed earneſtly for health to finiſh what might prove a ſource of virtuous entertainment. Not that I laid any ſtreſs on my <hi>own</hi> effort towards it, but becauſe the facts were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminently beautiful in <hi>themſelves;</hi> and courted every addition of fancy, with every embelliſhment of the heart. I recovered. Emma Corbett was concluded. The incidents, without the leaſt literary adornment, take a ſtrong hold of the feelings; and, probably, will owe more to their ſimplicity and native <hi>TRUTH,</hi> than if, by a more elaborate effort, I had robbed them of this <hi>genuine</hi> advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The tear of Senſibility</hi> is at once the ſofteſt and beſt evidence of the praiſe which it is my ambition to merit on this occaſion: and if it be my lot to enjoy this honour, you cannot be ignorant of the means by which it has been conferred. Notwithſtanding this, every thing, which tends to ſhew the world how entirely your <hi>generoſity</hi> prevailed over your <hi>intereſt,</hi> will, I know, be interdicted, I comply therefore, Sir, with the proſcriptions of delicacy, though I am thereby deprived of doing juſtice: and with whatever difficulty I repreſs the current of my gratitude; only reſerving to myſelf the pleaſure to declare publicly, how much I am, Sir,</p>

You imagine America is aggrieved, while I look upon <hi>her</hi> at the aggreſſor. What of that? Do we interfere with the opinions of each other? I was not acceſſary to the death of your ſon; and had it been my fate to meet him in the field, I can conceive the point on which nature would have inſiſted. She would gracefully have led us both a little from the line of duty, and ſpared one in ſympathy to the other N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had I ſeen the ſword tremble at his boſom, my own ſhould for that moment have been as a ſhield, and you know not <hi>how</hi> far I would have ventured for the brother of Emma. But as to the commiſſion, O be aſſured, I did not ſolicit it till I had well reflected on every conſequence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and poſſible, of obtaining it. It <hi>is</hi> obtained, and I rejoice; nor could it be reſigned to purchaſe a diadem, with Emma on a throne to wear it. Change ſides! No, Sir; if theſe are to be the terms, take back the hand you <hi>permitted</hi> me to win, and poſſeſs, undivided, her fortune and your own. You have not looked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately at my ſoul. As I am not, on the one hand, ſo <hi>ſenſual,</hi> to gratify my paſſion at the expence of the holy faith and the ſolemn ſervices which I have ſworn to my country; ſo neither am I ſo <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did</hi> on the other, as to court her inheritance without many endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, conſiſtent with the powers of my youth, to add ſomething to her fortune. Patrimony hath dropt from my hope, but nature may, perhaps, have beſtowed the equivalent. The arts of war, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than thoſe of peace, ſeem, at this conjuncture, to lay the ſtrongeſt claim to the genius of a young Engliſhman; and I have no notion of that indolence which can be content to fall into the arms of beauty and proſperity, without a ſingle effort to deſerve them. If, Sir, I have any tender intereſt in the heart of Emma, as I think I have, it has been more generouſly fought. But why do I argue with ſo much gravity, when perhaps you intend all this in the way of trial: willing to ſee if my attachment to my native country was not leſs than my paſſion for my miſtreſs. Yes, yes, this is your experiment. You wanted to know whether it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite or affection that influenced me in regard to your daughter, and you will not, I truſt, be diſpleaſed to find the baſis as ſolid as your friendſhip or ſolicitude might deſire.</p>
                     <p>Adieu, dear Sir; I thank you for the ſtratagem: and glory in every ſucceſs that draws me nearer to your heart.—</p>

I think you ought, as a man of honour, to drop correſponding with Emma, and let it ſeem to be your own act and deed ſelf-ſuggeſted, and ſelf-inſpired. This, however, your conſcience will beſt ſettle. To that I refer you. As you ſo ſoon depart, a few more letters cannot be very material. Farther avowals of love, however, I ſhall conſider as ſeductions.— Farewell. To wiſh you ſucceſs in your undertakings would be to partake of your folly: you will therefore excuſe me.

What you are pleaſed to call ſeduction, appears to me ſo abſolute a propriety, that I muſt take the liberty to perſiſt in it. I have reaſon to think the affections of your daughter are engaged. I cultivated them under your approving ſmile, and with your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſanction. I have not a heart that can put on or caſt off its partialities, exactly as the opinions of a third perſon—even though he be a father—happen to fluctuate. It is Emma, therefore, and <hi>only</hi> Emma, can prevail with me to ſtop the current of affection or of correſpondence. I refer you to <hi>her</hi> conſcience, ſince it is not an apt reference you make to mine.

Laſt night, my beloved friend—oh, laſt night! the hours betwixt ſix and ten!—have you any idea of a period that could be rated in compariſon with them? What a ſpace! it was all ſpirit and all ſoul.

                     <p>THE delightful letter of my charming Emma is lying in my boſom, as I take up the pen to reply. It came to hand at my poor Louiſa's—at the houſe of my languiſhing and lovely ſiſter; ſhe told me ſhe expected you. I paſſed an hour of pleaſing attendance, after which it became painful—ah, <hi>how</hi> painful!—You did not come. Why was this? Yet it matters not. It was not <hi>poſſible,</hi> or it was not <hi>fit.</hi> The <hi>fit</hi> and the <hi>poſſible,</hi> you know, are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which govern our actions.

I felt the force of the appeal but continued to be uneaſy. My ſiſter withdrew, and my anxiety increaſed. By way of mitigation, I took up a pen which lay before, me and marked with it my emotions; I marked them, my Emma, in numbers, "for the numbers came." Let them be acceptable. Let the ſincerity in the ſentiment atone for any defect in the poetry Send me word that you are compoſed, and let me meet you, as chearful as you ought to be, in the morning. Louiſa will look for you by ten o'clock.—Poor Louiſa! ah, that Edward had not fallen!—Ah, that the brother of Emma were yet alive!— that he ſaw the injuries done to this unhappy country with <hi>my</hi> eyes, and that, as much inſpired by Louiſa as I by Emma, he was now making loyal preparation to fight the battle of Britain by the ſide of</p>

A theatre of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief already fatal to the lover of Louiſa — I faint under the thought! The time ſteals on, even while I am talking of its lapſe. Your virtues all known — all tried — all preſſing on the eye, and twining round the heart. It is terrible — it is too much! In mercy be leſs kind — leſs amiable — leſs engaging.

Or when cruel neceſſity ſhall tear you from me, which ſhe is preparing to do, how am I to ſupport it? Fancy ſickens to reflect upon the vaſt and formidable diſtance that is ſo ſoon to divide us. To ſeparate for ſuch a purpoſe too! How few hopes —how few conſolations! Correſpondence will be delayed—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terupted — interdicted. The ſoft and ſweet ſolace flowing from pen to pen will henceforth lie at the mercy of winds and waves. Our ſentiments will depend upon the terrifying circumſtances of war.

                     <p>Ah! what is there ſo likely to melt the ſpirit of a ſoldier into cowardice, as the tears of Emma? She will not then give way to the tender torrent. She will court the balmy bleſſings of eaſe and hope. She will check theſe convulſive tranſports of diſtreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo deſtructive to my honour, and her own health. She will buffet the wild waves of adverſity, nor thus ſuffer them to overwhelm her. Conſider theſe things, O my beloved Emma!

That I am in this bitter period, when I am about to loſe what you yourſelf ſo lately thought moſt precious, able to write with ſo much argumentative compoſure, is, alas! no ſign of my indifference, but an inſtance — perhaps the ſtrongeſt that could be given — of that ſteady attachment, which, born of honour, is nouriſhed by virtue. To be <hi>attached,</hi> is the dictate of nature. To be attached to a man of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>morals,</hi> is the dictate of delicacy; and the ſymptom, I conceive, of a good diſpoſition. Such, my moſt honoured father, were the elementary rules I caught from you. Would you controvert your own maxims? Or, while the merit of the object increaſes, is it a fit time to withdraw from it the love, which nature and common ſenſe ſeem to ſay ſhould increaſe in proportion?</p>
                     <p>But you depend, I find, on the lenitives of abſence, and of time. I will not anſwer for the vigour of my own mind, for I know the frail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y of our nature. If it is ſoothing to my father to count upon what theſe things <hi>may</hi> do, let me not deſtroy his ſource of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. I am not, thanks to <hi>his</hi> corrected culture, enough the giddy girl to burſt forth into aſſeverations of <hi>conſtancy everlaſting,</hi> merely to vex a parent by <hi>ſetting my heart</hi> againſt his wiſhes: I would deſire rather to diſtruſt my own temper; and, laying my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections open to his view, beg him to form his judgment upon a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of them.—But I dare not miſlead one who hath ſo entire a right to be treated frankly. I make no vows; yet, in proportion as an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is deliberate, is it not fixed and permanent? And this being my firſt and only affection, (having beſides a man of unblemiſhed character and congenial manners for its object) have I not a right ſtrongly to ſuſpect—But enjoy the opinion you ſo ſtrongly adopt. Bleſs you, my father, for the gentleneſs of your inhibitions. You do not threaten — You do not rave. Theſe might have augmented my diſtreſs, but could not have abated my affection. A circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of which parents ſeem ſo unconſcious, that they deſtroy the effect of authority by the vehemence with which they exert it. They confuſe, but do not convince: terrify, but do not conciliate; and almoſt juſtify diſobedience, by their manner of enforcing duty.</p>
                     <p>Oh Heaven! the clock is ſtriking —the hour is come — the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute— the moment is approaching. I will ring for a ſervant to take this into the parlour. My feet will ſcarcely carry me down ſtairs. An ingenuous nature appeals to you for pity, Sir — will you refuſe? Oh, my father, my father, my ſpirits have done their utmoſt, ere the trial is begun. Suffer me to be unhappy. —Prepare for me — oh! prepare for me the parental hand againſt my return, and do not let <hi>my</hi> tenderneſs abate <hi>your's.</hi>

                     <p>I FLOAT on the boſom of the ocean while I write this: but, as if in courteſy, the wind it changed, or rather it ceaſes to blow ſufficiently, and in this harbour we are to ride till it riſes. You well know, in what manner I ſhall employ the interval; it ſhall be dedicated to ſoftneſs and to Emma. I have peruſed your dear parting legacy — no, not legacy, that is too funeral a word—your parting pledge.— Yes, I have peruſed it, and, ſoldier as I am, do not bluſh to tell you that I have wept over its contents. I preſſed it with fervent and chaſte ardour to my lips and to my boſom — I laid it ſoft and cloſe upon the panting heart, and am relieved — as much ſo, my Emma, as I ought to be, or as is conſiſtent with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature at this criſis. Oh, my dear friend, it is indeed a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic period. I now feel that I had ſet myſelf too hard a taſk. I pretended to rally it off as a military manoeuvre; but I find "he jeſts at ſcars that never felt a wound." Nature revolted, and I have ſuffered more from not giving her fair play.

No matter, I will put the beſt foot forward, and be with you in a day or two. Mean time, I will get me a new wig; and, to ſhew you how much I am in earneſt, will try to deceive your Emma as much as conveniently may be, by ordering it to be made ſo as to reſemble a reſponſible head of hair; for I find, ſince I came <hi>home</hi> from India, there is nothing in a young Lady's eye ſo ridiculous as a wig.

                     </head>
                     <p>WHAT a return have you made for the trifle I ſent you, O, moſt dear and ingenious friend I ever directing the current of that rich ſtream (which knows no diminution, but ſcatters fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility and fragrance as it flows) to comfort, to amuſe, or to inſtruct me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How I rejoice, that the bagatelle pleaſed you. It was my firſt intention to have the hair diſpoſed into an ornament for the ſhirt, but I conſidered the nature of that delicate ſentiment you feel for Emma. I reflected that it was <hi>retired,</hi> that it ſhunned every thing obtruſive, that it could ill brook the idle, and perhaps the wanton curioſity of thoſe cockaded heroes, who imagine tenderneſs incompatible with bravery. On theſe accounts, therefore, I choſe to ſuit my locket to <hi>that</hi> ſituation only in which your delicate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality would be moſt likely to place it.</p>
                     <p>Round your neck, my dear Henry, let it ever hang, impervious to every eye but that of the proprietor. — A ſacred caliſman may it prove — a ſoft ſhield thrown over your boſom by the trembling hand of a friend! —O, that I could breathe upon it all the virtues that were ſuppoſed to be in poſſeſſion of the moſt benevolent geoii — that it had ſtrength of charm ſufficient to preſerve you as ſecurely from ſickneſs, ſorrow, and miſchance, — from the bullet and the ſword, — as I do firmly believe the ſight and touch of it will arm your heart againſt the impreſſion of every error, and the practice of every irregularity.</p>
                     <p>Your letter, with its fair and tuneful incloſure, found me upon my pillow, from which I haſtened with a rapidity which is the ſpontaneous impulſe of unaffected tenderneſs. Like a much-wiſhed-fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yes, thou admirable and honourable friend, the die is caſt, thy invaluable love ſhall be the ſuſtaining ſolace of my future exiſtence. Ah! may no jarring word or diſcordant thought ever riſe up to diſturb an amity ſo ſacred and ſo pure! The fine ſpirit of our eſteem, my Henry, ſhall extend its delicate influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over all the rougher paſſages, on a ſea far more ſtormy than that whoſe boſom is now preſſed by your veſſel — Over every trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled moment our affection ſhall ſoftly diffuſe itſelf,

                        </q>
Oh, Henry, my heart dilates as I write and the ſoft drops deſcend in a pathetic and ſweet aſſurance of our future felicity; but do not be uneaſy that I weep,—ſuch tears will not hurt me. They are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious drops that invigorate virtue, and freſhen as they fall. Oh! thoſe ſacred hours we have paſſed together, in friendſhip, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, in books; no divided attention, thought ſaluting thought, the mutual tear, every thing, or dear or elegant, included in every moment. Carry the remembrance of ſuch intercourſe over the world of waters. Call to mind the time when our lengthened at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the moral page, inſtead of relaxing, grew ſtronger and more fixed; when our underſtandings and our hearts ſeemed equally to refine and to expand!</p>
                     <p>Yes, Henry, I will try to adopt that gentle ſpirit of prophecy, which breathes ſo beautiful an ardour over your conſolatory pages. I do not <hi>expect</hi> to gather the bloom of the roſe, without feeling the puncture of the ſurrounding thorn. I gratefully take it with all its little wounding appendages—I place it in my boſom.</p>
                     <p>—I have promiſed not to repine: yet, if a gentle murmur ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eſcapes, let me, I prithee, find indulgence for it, and do not chide me; oh, how often have I wiſhed ſince your departure, to be the companion of your voyage and all its conſequences, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever multiplied, however menacing! And, after all, Henry, your ſituation is more tolerable than mine: the travelling friend has the advantage of thoſe who are left, in ſolitude, behind. The very velocity of the motion is favourable: in paſſing rapidly along, the freſhneſs of the air, and the change of objects, engage and divert the mind inſenſibly; while the poor forlorn one, that remains fixed to the former ſpot, has only to mark the preſent period, to look in vain around for what is loſt, to caſt a "longing, lingering eye" upon the paſt, and, in the torture of reflection, to confeſs that ſuch things <hi>were,</hi>—but <hi>are,</hi> alas! no more.</p>
                     <p>It has been my fortune to paſs thro' the ſtreet where you reſided, more than once ſince your departure. O, think with what emotions I viewed thoſe windows which belonged to an apartment ſo lately your's! The ſight of your <hi>grave</hi> could ſcarcely have produced any thing more affecting: and yet I feel that I ſhall like to paſs often by them. I do not pretend to <hi>account</hi> for theſe little touches, I only ſimply <hi>relate</hi> them. Will not your feeling nature eaſily explain them?</p>
                     <p>And now confeſs, Hammond, that I have arrived at the due degree of heroiſm: confeſs, that I am ſufficiently <hi>ſoldier'd</hi>; for I can hold the pen, and impreſs the quiet-ſeeming ſentiment, with my eyes full of tears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my heart full of ſorrow. What more can you expect from female philoſophy? What more can you expect from a friend who has been uſed to regret the abſence of an hour as a misfortune?</p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſend off this, on the ſlight chance of its reaching you. If
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017678_0027_0FA21F1D72F46F00"/>
it ſhould not—what then? what will be its fate?—I care not. Groſs as is the world, were every ſentiment of my ſoul laid open to its view, I could ſupport the ſcrutiny. I ſtill could "<hi>boaſt</hi> the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful weakneſs," if indeed it be a weakneſs of my heart. The <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of your receiving my letter is worth the hazard of diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and as every moment is now at the caprice of the wind.

                     <p>YOUR dear favour, like a parting bleſſing, comes to hand while the breezes are riſing, and the whole crew are engaged in the buſtle of preparation. We have already weighed anchor, the ſails will ſoon ceaſe to ſlap againſt the maſt, for I perceive the mariners are climbing the ſhrouds to ſquare the canvaſs to the gale, which is at length favourable, All hands are aloof—All hearts are panting with various paſſions·—I feel that we are in motion.—I can hear the cleaving keel cut the waves.—The wind blows freſher, as we clear the calms that brood in the harbour; and, as I turn my eye aſtern of the veſſel, I behold the billows whiten into foam. Alas! the ſhore ſeems to go back, and we are getting into a wider ſea. The watermen who have followed us thus far in their boat on ſome neceſſary buſineſs, now tack about, and pepare again to fetch the harbour.</p>
                     <p>Brief let me be.—Many of my fellow officers are ſtanding idle on the deck, and ſome are roaring catches in the cabbin; while Henry Hammond is writing an adieu to one dear woman, who is the pride and pleaſure of his life. I confeſs alſo, that a ſigh is heaving from my heart, and a tear is running along my cheek. The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers look at me as if they ſuſpected an infirmity. Let them. In the day of battle we ſhall ſee, whether tenderneſs or diſſipation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the truer courage or magnanimity. I have a little bribed the boatmen, who are rowing laboriouſly after us, but the laſt, laſt moment is come, and the laſt, laſt adieus; the finiſhing farewell muſt be given—<hi>farewell, then!</hi> I leave you in full poſſeſſion of my heart; I leave you to your own virtue, and to the Providence of GOD.</p>

                     <head>LETTER XXXIV. TO F. BERKLEY, <hi>Eſq.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>FREDERICK, he is ſet off; but I have no reaſon to imagine his embarkation a good omen. As far as the <hi>father's</hi> intereſt goes, I am ſafe, but <hi>that</hi> does not go very far. To tell you the truth, I am <hi>myſelf</hi> ſomewhat an odd kind of a fellow in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. I ſhould not chooſe to accept an alienated or reluctant hand. Nor could I ſit quiet under the idea of poſſeſſing a woman, who gave her perſon as an equivalent for a title and a fortune. Theſe niceties, you will ſay, are, at my age, ſomewhat <hi>out of date</hi>; and I ought not to <hi>expect</hi> ſuch etiquettes will be attended to by a fine young woman, whom, perhaps, you imagine, I might jump at on <hi>any</hi> terms. Look'y' Frederick, leave me to ſettle my own ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, and do you ſettle your's. I think fit, for old acquaintance ſake, to unboſom to you a very fooliſh ſecret. The leaſt you can do is to hear my ſtory, and to let me tell it my own way. I am now in love "<hi>nolens volens.</hi>" You may laugh, but I <hi>feel</hi> it is not in my power to extricate myſelf. Would the wench had not fallen in my way! <hi>Theſe</hi> are what I call croſs incidents. When a man is jogging on, and has got ſoberly to the reſting place, <hi>then</hi> to have a ſlap on the ſhoulder from ſuch an urchin as Cupid, <hi>then</hi> to be attacked bow and arrow in hand—Is not this too bad—Is not this too ridiculous—too humiliating?</p>
                     <p>After you have uttered the ſarcaſtic <hi>yes,</hi> I ſhall proceed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that this mighty ridiculous thing is the moſt <hi>ſerious tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: and what renders it the more perplexing is, that, old fellow as I am, it is a circumſtance wholly <hi>new</hi> to me—not more ſo to the verieſt ſtripling when he wafts from him the maiden ſighs for a tripping chit of fifteen. I am not in my dotage, <hi>am</hi> I, Berkley, at forty-three? No, hang it; that is not what they call being well-ſtricken—<hi>is</hi> it? I have ſome terms to keep with <hi>myſelf</hi> too. I ſhould not <hi>chooſe</hi> to be <hi>too</hi> abſurd.</p>
                     <p>But this young adventurer! This happy hero! The parts of his character that I have been able to pick up—ſuch as health, agreeableneſs, genius, ſpirit, courage, and animation, are not abſolutely in my favour, are they, Frederick?</p>
                     <p>Let us ſee what <hi>I</hi> have got to put in the balance <hi>againſt</hi> them. — the gout— ſmall-pox pits—not the ninetieth part of a muſe—leſs courage than caution, and ſpirits ſomewhat harraſſed out in the real wear and tear of worldly events. I don't like it, Frederick.— It won't do. My lighter ſcale is hurled aloof, and I am bouncing my head againſt the beam moſt abominably. O Frederick!</p>
                     <p>Is there, then, nothing to throw in by way of bringing a middle aged gentleman on the equilibrium? Yes: A luſty lump of <hi>money.</hi> The <hi>golden make weight</hi> of fifty thouſand pounds. Fair force of <hi>metal,</hi> Frederick! Our cockaded ſpark has not any thing to poiſe <hi>that,</hi> in the opinion of the world; and yet, if this ſhould happen to be <hi>Emma's</hi> opinion. I am ſo whimſical a mortal, that I ſhould eſteem her <hi>leſs</hi> for the very circumſtance which would make
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017678_0033_0FA21F2372AC2B00"/>
my ſait <hi>more ſucceſsful.</hi> The fortune of Henry Hammond, I find, is ſmall. He has <hi>not</hi> much money, but he has what does a thouſand times more execution in a delicate boſom: he has <hi>ſentiment.</hi> O that curſed <hi>ſentiment</hi>! — a term, Frederick, of late invention, to expreſs old emotions in a new way — a term, which many uſe, more affect, few underſtand, and ſtill fewer feel, — a term, which — which — in ſhort — curſe that ſentiment!</p>
                     <p>We deceive ourſelves, my friend, and in my next I will tell you <hi>how.</hi> Good by' for the preſent.</p>

                     <p>I SAID I would tell you how we deceive ourſelves. I will. The <hi>ſlender circumſtances,</hi> and even the <hi>great misfortunes</hi> of a lover, are no kind of objection in the eyes of a <hi>ſentimental miſtreſs</hi>; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments of the world call forth the ſiner ſentiments, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a ſtrange thing, but a true, that this ſame adorable SENTIMENT has ever had (with indeed very few exceptions) a moſt ſore quarrel with ſolid ſilver and gold; and with the coin current of a country. In the account of young <hi>Engliſh</hi> women (who are the greateſt worſhippers of the fair idol) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus it is, that fathers ſacrifice to Plutus, and children (eſpecially daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) to a beggarly Deity, whom Plutus laughs to ſcorn: and hence the ſource of ten thouſand family feuds — hence the riſe of ſeparate maintenance; and the fall of domeſtic confidence.

                     <p>It is on this account, Frederick, that I regret having ſeen the fair Emma Corbett.

                        </gap>, during my long reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence abroad, this Hammond was under your guardianſhip; that he lived with you and Emma ſome years in the very houſe called Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, which I have purchaſed of you; that <hi>there</hi> the young man was countenanced by you, and his addreſſeſs to your daughter <hi>not diſapproved.</hi> N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To be ingenuous, I am afraid you think <hi>I</hi> am a BETTER <hi>match.</hi> Look'y' Charles, I am no hero, but an honeſt man, and you ſhall not break your word, (as many a <hi>very</hi> honeſt man <hi>has</hi> done) in compliance with certain rigorous circumſtances —Let us talk like old friends, newly met.</p>
                     <p>On my leaving England, <hi>I</hi> was <hi>poor, you</hi> were <hi>rich.</hi> In the roll of human affairs, perhaps, now that <hi>I</hi> am returned rich, <hi>you</hi> may be, comparatively, poor,— that is, you may have ſome wiſe ſcheme to carry, and cannot well bring it about. I can no otherway ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for this ſudden change in disfavour of Hammond—for you uſed to be fixed in your opinions—than that, impelled to an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by diſtreſſing incidents, you,—In ſhort, is there any hard part in your ſituation, which you imagine an alliance with me might remove? and, <hi>but</hi> for this, would not Hammond be as much the object of <hi>your</hi> choice as he is that of your daughter?</p>
                     <p>Corbett, ſpeak plain. What caſh do you want? Let not your neceſſities violate your engagements. Condeſcend to be a borrower where you may ſo ſafely rely upon your lender; and where, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting a debt, you may confer an obligation. To plead for a rival would be unnatural — but to ſave a friend from error, and myſelf from diſgrace, is not amiſs.</p>
                     <p>An old and intimate friend of your's happened to ſtep in, juſt as I was directing my ſervant to carry my luggage to your houſe, Your name was no ſooner mentioned, than he exclaimed — "Poor Corbett, how miſerable muſt he be at the departure of young Hammond, who is betrothed to his daughter Emma!

                     <head>LETTER XLI. TO Sir ROBERT RAYMOND.</head>
                     <p>YOU force me in to a very unwelcome explanation. Unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, becauſe <hi>precipitate</hi>; and which I deſigned to have opened at a proper opportunity, in the hour of confidence: however, as the circumſtance is thus haſtened on, I muſt ſuit myſelf to it.</p>
                     <p>I am not by any means ſo rich as I was at your departure from this country for India: yet I am too rich— and ſhould think myſelf ſo had I only one guinea upon the earth— to marry Emma to <hi>your</hi> fortune to mend <hi>mine.</hi> I did love Hammond, even with a father's love, and in a legal ſenſe to <hi>be</hi> his father was my favourite inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet that idea is now, of <hi>all</hi> others, the fartheſt from my mind, and never CAN be revived. It is a little hard that you have got me into ſuch an exigence as to make it impoſſible for me, with any credit, to keep the great ſecret of my life.</p>
                     <p>Henry Hammond is, againſt all advice, and perſuaſion, violently attached to thoſe cruel <hi>ſpoilers,</hi> who have gone ſword in hand into the bowels of a country, where my dear ſon has fallen a victim— a country which is moſt barbarouſly butchered, and to whoſe well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare I am bound by ties the moſt tender and intereſting. I would reject <hi>you,</hi> I would reject an EMPEROR that ſhould pretend to the hand of Emma, and yet ſacrilegiouſly pollute his <hi>own</hi> hand, in the life-blood of AMERICA. Oh, thou hapleſs land! thou art precious to me beyond the breath which I am now drawing!—beyond every hope that I can form on this ſide Heaven!—beyond my daughter— yes even beyond Emma, becauſe thou art equally the object of my love, and more of my <hi>pity!</hi> The rapacious HENRY is gone to plunge another p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nature herſelf lies bleeding on thy ſhore, and <hi>there</hi> the inhuman mother has plunged the dagger (with her own barbarous hand) into the bowels of her child!—</p>
                     <p>But oh the deep and tremendous reſtitutions are at bond; I ſee them, with a prophetic eye, this moment before me. Horrors ſhall be re-paid with <hi>accumulation</hi> of horror. The wounds in America ſhall be ſucceeded by deep mouthed gaſhes in the heart of Britain!

The houſe of a very <hi>old friend</hi> of my father's, lately landed from India, is now our reſidence, and it was once the reſidence of Emma and of Henry; for it is that very <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry</hi> where my father (who has ſince ſold it to the preſent proprietor) had uſed to paſs with his ſelect friends, ſome months of every ſummer. Since his American miſfortunes—O, pardon me the mention of them! he deteſts the country, and has, I find, ſold the whole property to the agent employed to provide a country houſe and ſome pleaſure grounds for Sir Robert Raymond, (that is his name) previous to his arrival in England. The agent fixed upon this ſpot, and it became the ſeat of Sir Robert before my father knew that it was to be inhabited by a friend. Sir Robert is delighted with the purchaſe, and my father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices to ſee a domain which he once loved, ſo properly diſpoſed of. You alſo remember this retreat; for was you not the aſſociate of our flowery infancy?— Louiſa and Edward, Henry and Emma, formed the dear, family circle.

I cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Corbett to propoſe me to his daughter, nor have I the confidence to propoſe myſelf. And, indeed, the more frequently I converſe with her (which I take all decent occaſions of doing) the more I ſee her, hear her voice, and perceive the ſenſe "diſtinct and clear" that is falling from her lips whenever ſhe opens them, the leſs I am able to ſpeak, nay the leſs aſſurance have I to believe, that ſo much merit, youth, and beauty, will have any thing to ſay, ſeriouſly, to a fellow with ſo ſun-burnt a viſage, and <hi>unſentimental</hi> a ſet of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the middle-aged Robert Raymond.</p>

Inform me.</p>

I do really think I am engaged in a very unthriſty undertaking—a looking-glaſs that happens to hang near the table on which I am now writing, confirms me in this opinion. There is ſuch a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable air of <hi>confidence</hi> in <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> I ſhould ſucceed, that had not the torrid zone ſcorched all the <hi>graces of the blood</hi> out of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, I ſhould certainly bluſh.</p>
                     <p>I write, you ſee, in my old way, but I am put ſorely out of my old road for all that. It is, after all, a droll ſort of a defect I poſſeſs, that of really thinking I am too old and ugly to be an object of a young woman's attachment. Yet, there is nothing very prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this idea, either. Speak to Emma, ſays paſſion.—Dread a repulſe, replies common ſenſe.—Then give up the point, and think no more about it, cries Prudence.— "Ah! teach me how I ſhould forget to think," anſwers Love, in the language of Romeo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A pretty ſtruggle this for a grave man of forty-three, Frederick, is it not?

                  </head>
                  <p>THERE is no ſpecies of publication which ſeems to be more agreeably received than that which illuſtrates the characters of men diſtinguiſhed for their abilities, venerable for their erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and admired for their virtues. The political hiſtory of great men is uſeful and neceſſary to many; but the domeſtic hiſtory of all men is uſeful and neceſſary to all.</p>
                  <p>Among the materials from whence the biographer forms the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of domeſtic characters, private letters are conſidered as the moſt valuable, becauſe they are the moſt unequivocal authorities of real ſentiment and opinion. Converſation is too fugitive to be remembered; public declarations may be oftentimes ſuſpected; but the epiſtolary communications of friendſhip may be depended upon as faithful to the mind from whence they ariſe. The following letters, therefore, as proceeding from a Nobleman whoſe great talents promiſed no ſmall utility to his country, and whoſe character has been the ſubject of ſuch general ſpeculation, will, without doubt, meet with a favourable reception.</p>

                     <p>BY a line juſt received from Louiſa I am interdicted at preſent from writing to her, and the ſentiments which now oppreſs me are indeed, on <hi>all</hi> accounts, improper to offer a mind pierced by ſo ſimilar a ſorrow. Yet, to reſtrain the whole dreadful weight in my own boſom would ſurely kill me. Do <hi>you</hi> then, O my dear couſin, my worthy Caroline, do <hi>you</hi> aſſiſt me. — Tell me, I conjure you, where the feeling heart ſhall find a ſanctuary? Tell me, what foliage is thick and impenetrable enough to repel that terror which aſſails an unhappy woman, when the object of every hope and every fear is determined upon dangers the moſt complicated and deciſive? Henry, your <hi>favourite</hi> Henry, is gone, you know, to defend his country, to ſignalize his bravery, and to ſerve his King. I admit the propriety of the enterprize, according to the laws of <hi>honour,</hi> but I weep at the extremity of its horror when tried by the laws of <hi>feeling</hi> and <hi>humanity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The glowing arguments of that dear departed, I did not dare to oppoſe. I faintly breathed the female reſiſtance, I feared, leſt my affection might ſeem to be ſelfiſh, by conteſting the point of ſeparation. I violated the ſoftneſs of my ſex, and the tenderneſs of my nature, to reſtrain the flowing tide that roſe in billows to my heart, which laboured with the agony of ſuppreſſion. His being this moment upon the ſea, eager to gain the ſeats of hoſtility, is a proof of it! Perhaps, I might have ſeduced him from this adventure, ſince humanity and love (oh, how oppoſite from ravage and war!) are the principles which ſhine the brighteſt in the ſpotleſs hiſtory of Henry's youth. But I dreaded the after operations of inexorable honour, which might deteſt the trembling hand that ſaved it from the ſword.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>now,</hi> my Caroline, <hi>now</hi> that he is far removed from the voice of my complainings, and can no longer be diſarmed by their ſweet impreſſion, ſuffer, oh ſuffer me to mourn — ſuffer me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrate that wanton and inſatiable <hi>power,</hi> which ſcatters deſolation o'er the land! Ah this dire <hi>daemon</hi> of <hi>battle!</hi> —this <hi>daeman,</hi> who, with giant footſteps, tramples upon the beſt and moſt beautiful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the ſoul— who delights to hear the wail of the wounded, and the groans of the expiring—whoſe veſſels ſail upon a ſea of tears, and are wafted by ſighs which are extorted from the tender boſom. I ſee, I ſee the ſanguinary power. He ſhoots athwart the realms of affrighted fancy, in a robe of crimſon ten times dyed in the blood of his votaries. The ſoft verdure of the ſpring withers as he advances. The ſtreams of plenty, which fertilized a happy wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The bounties and the beauties of nature fall before him. — Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories are torn up by the roots, and empires mingle in the common ravage. Behold, chained to his triumphal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dreadful, dreadful retinue! and all for what?— for what, my Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line? Wherefore is the peace of the world thus to be deſtroyed? Wherefore is man to raiſe his hand againſt the life of man, and deliberate murder to be intitled to applauſe?</p>
                     <p>Hear, O humanity, the reply, and be <hi>ſtill</hi> if thou canſt! The rulers of different realms, in the wanton exertion of power, infringe upon what is falſely called the property of each other. Men, who are utter ſtrangers to the very perſons of one another, and are ſeparated, perhaps, by partitions of a thouſand leagues, quarrel for a few vile acres of the dirt which ſhall preſently cover the toiling race; and the lives of a people are devoted to the ſword. Earth itſelf, wide as is extended her beautiful domain, is not <hi>enough</hi> extenſive for theſe pigmy mortals to divide amongſt themſelves; nor are the natural miſeries of a very ſhort life, with all its moral, all its civil, all its ſocial evils, ſufficient, without the aids of untimely and <hi>voluntary</hi> ſlaughter. The hurry of the ſcene, the din of the battle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that political muſic which drowns the cry of diſtreſs, may <hi>paſs over</hi> theſe ſentiments, and humanity will not have time to hear, nor to be heard.

I want words to tell you how I am touched by thoſe exertions you have made to acquire a conqueſt of reaſon over paſſion; and, though I have ſometimes detected the tear upon your cheek, and felt the breath of your ſigh as it broke, by ſtealth, from your boſom; yet—In ſhort, my ſweet girl, it ſeems now to be a proper criſis to communicate the hopes, anxieties, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my heart.

For ſome days I have penetrated a certain deſign, and I predict the purpoſe of this meeting. Perhaps—Oh Heaven! he is juſt at the door. He ſtops at the head of the ſtairs—I hear him ſigh heavily. This is not, I feel, a moment in which I can bear any addition of diſtreſs. Here is a private door that leads to my apartment. My father is pacing about on the other ſide. I hear the handle of the door ſhake in his hand. Some violent agitation is upon him. At <hi>this</hi> time the interview would kill me.—He is opening the door. I haſten my retreat.</p>

                     <p>IT is with great willingneſs I ſet down to make a reply to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you addreſſed to me; but it is not without much concern that I find it neceſſary to uſe the pen in anſwer to thoſe which you addreſſed to Louiſa, whoſe preſent ſtate of health is ſuch as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her writing.

of ſickneſs, to alleviate the ſuſpenſe of her beloved Emma (in regard to the promiſed articles of confidence) ſhe inſtructs me to acquaint you, in the conciſeſt way that I am able, of the means by which ſhe became the wife of your unfortunate brother, as well as with the reaſons which prevailed with her to keep that union a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from <hi>his</hi> family, from her <hi>own,</hi> and from the <hi>world.</hi> She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives too, that the deeper colours of diſtreſs in <hi>her</hi> fate, may, by compariſon, alleviate the ſofter tints of wretchedneſs in <hi>your's</hi>; for at the worſt, my dear couſin, as matters now ſtand, you have a lover living who is very properly the object of many a charming hope; while the poor Louiſa is daily tortured with reflecting on the death of one yet dearer than a lover—even a huſband and a father, who is the object of many a miſery too mighty for the ſolace of ſighs and tears.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the letter I have had the pleaſure to receive from you it beſpeaks a heart overflowing with ſtreams of genuine philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and beautifully becomes the pen of Emma Corbett. But believe me, believe a woman who has been connected from her infancy with men devoted to the trade of arms—believe the daughter of a veteran chief, and the widow of one who felt the military paſſion in all its force—believe <hi>her</hi> when ſhe tells you, that ſuch gentle arguments are never of the leaſt conſequence in the eyes, or on the minds of a ſoldier. They ſerve only to make female weakneſs the more pitied by the men, who think the dignity of a more reſolved courage <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned</hi> to ſhew itſelf in <hi>contraſt.</hi> Sometimes, it is true, the tears of a wife will excite the manly drop in the eye of a huſband; but it tarries not. The voice of public fame is, on theſe occaſions, louder than that of private affection. The world fixes an earneſt look on the actions of an officer. One hero inflames another: the ſparks of glory paſs like an electric power: the neceſſity of a brave <hi>example</hi> becomes apparent: the profeſſion ſoon grows into a darling paſſion: the blood warms: the genius of war takes poſſeſſion of every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: home connexions are forgotten: the ſcene of action terminates the proſpect: the warrior can ſee no farther. Valour and victory ſeem marching before him. There is not leiſure for a private emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tenderneſs would aſſiſt the efforts of his foe He gives himſelf up, therefore, nobly and abſolutely, to the battle; wounds can make no impreſſion upon him in the progreſs of his ardent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer; and death itſelf is, in that moment, leſs terrible than defeat.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, my lovely couſin, are not the ſentiments of a theoriſt, but caught immediately from the lips of the very heroes who prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed every action they relate. In the interval of peace, few men of any order have a more elegant humanity than the Engliſh offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; and all the endearing qualifications, which make up the great domeſtic characters, are to be found amongſt them; but in the day of conteſt, my couſin, a different duty calls upon them, and military fame is as eaſily wounded, and its wounds as vital to felicity, as thoſe of a woman.</p>

                        </gap> not the brother <hi>ſoldier</hi> only, to whom Julius introduced us. In their appearance there was a fraternal <hi>ſimilarity,</hi> not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the features and limbs which remained, as in the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017678_0058_0FA21F3E7B6FF528"/>
which had happened to thoſe inviſible parts which lay ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in different quarters of the globe.</p>
                     <p>Julius was the younger of the Carbines, and as he placed himſelf <hi>ſide ways</hi> upon the bed, and deſired Carbine the elder (whoſe name was Neſtor) to ſuſpend the attack — he told his ſtory.</p>
                     <p>We ſlept in the ſame cradle, and were nurſed up for the ſervice. Our little arms—</p>
                     <p>He flouriſhed a ſtump which projected about four inches from the right ſhoulder—Our little arms—</p>
                     <p>But I have begun the matter wrong and prematurely, for before I relate the account which Carbine gave of himſelf, I ſhould offer ſome deſcription of his perſon, as well as that of his brother Neſtor. It is the ſtump of Julius which reminds me of this.</p>
                     <p>Carbine the elder was the remnant of a noble figure, who in the uprightneſs of his youth muſt have riſen ſix feet from the earth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly. He had the marks of about ſeventy years wearing in his face — allowing for the natural vigour of his form, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of incident, time, and profeſſion. The preſent ſtoop in his ſhoulders was favourable to the height, or rather to the want of height in his apartment. It is not without juſt cauſe that I called Neſtor a <hi>remnant.</hi> Nature originally formed in him her faireſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions. At the time I ſaw him he was a capital figure reduced. For inſtance, if you looked him in the face, or, more properly to ſpeak, in the reſidue of his face, you would perceive, in his left cheek, a deep ſcarification, which boaſted no ſort of rivalſhip with the glorious embrowning of the other that had received no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. Though Neſtor himſelf ſaid, "the whole cheek, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the half cheek, looked like an errant poltroon." "It is a cheek," cried he, "which ſeems to have done no duty; now here," continued he, turning the other ſide to view with much tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, "here are the ſigns of ſervice."</p>

Sorely battered were the outworks of both. It is worth while to obſerve how the matter was ſettled to their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and credit. The thigh of Julius became the victim of a parapet, but then Neſtor was even with him when he had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to drop his left arm in the counterſcarp. But as if fortune did not imagine an arm, and that a <hi>left</hi> arm, a ſufficient equivalent to a whole thigh, amputated at one deciſive whizz by a cannon ball, ſhe deprived Neſtor of his right foot, which was left at the bottom of an entrenchment in Flanders. The younger Carbine had the track of a muſket viſible at the extremity of his neck, and the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, with which that muſket was charged, ſlanted along the left jaw, carrying off ſome of the fineſt teeth in the world, and which, perhaps, are even yet to be ſeen in one of the foſſes To bring the military ſcale even, on the part of Julius, he has the good fortune to conceal under his hat (which, upon account of that concealment he

But Julius had his <hi>unoſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> wounds too: his ſhirt covering no leſs than ſix, inſomuch that his boſom was croſſed this way and that, direct and tranſverſe, like a draught board. I detected the fluſh of ſomething like vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in the countenance of Julius, as he threw open his chitterlin, and opened his ſhirt-collar under pretence of too much heat: but Carbine the elder checked his brother's ambition by by baring his right arm to his ſhoulder, (or rather begging <hi>me</hi> to bare it) and there diſcovering a maſked battery of blows, which were a fair match for thoſe in the breaſt of Julius.</p>

                     <p>— the veteran Carbines, after having platooned and pioneered it for a number of years, in the cauſe of their country, found at length they could keep the field no longer.</p>
                     <p>They entered the Temple of Peace: but not quite on the footing of ordinary members. The ſenior Carbine privately enjoyed ſome ſmall privileges, and the junior was in poſſeſſion of the caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties derivable from ſhewing the hoſpital to ſuch as had the curioſity to ſurvey it: and he hopped about with his <hi>ruins</hi> in a manner that engaged one's pity and admiration.</p>

                        <hi>A ſecond rent in the fragment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>—</p>
                     <p>Now Neſtor was a man of enalienable affections. They were not to be ſubdued. The military paſſion was by no means dead in his boſom. The heart of the ſoldier was ſtill viſible in his little bed-chamber. There were to be ſeen, ſuſpended from the walls, the battered co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But this was nothing. The practical part of a ſoldier's diſcipline did Neſtor carry on in a room of forty inches diameter.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner were we all ſeated by the ſide of the bed, than a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ceremony began. He had ſix ſons, all little, all living for their country, and in ſecret training for the battle under their father. It was his cuſtom, thrice in the week, to turn the key upon all the penſioners but his brother, and inſtruct his family in the art of war. Poor as he was, he had actually been at the coſt of equipping them; had fitted up for them ſomething that reſembled a uniform, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017678_0060_0FA21F3FF1B1DCE0"/>
in miniature accoutrements, preſented them with the ſword, the muſquet, and the bayonet.</p>
                     <p>The ſoldier's ſcience was taught them by the veteran. One branch or another of the art military was the ſubject of every day. The ſons of Neſtor Carbine knew not the enervating luxuries of artificial heat: they thawed the ſeverity of the ſeaſons with nobler fires. Their education was wholly martial. At night they liſtened to the lecture, and their ſwords were drawn forth to practiſe what they had heard in the morn. They engaged their ſtrengthening arms in the <hi>mock</hi> fight, that they might be prepared for the <hi>real</hi> one. It was now the evening of the ravelin, then of the flanking; now of the fortification, then of the foſſé; now of the half-moon, then of the epaulment; now of the ſaps, and then of the ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade; now of the horn-works, and then of the baſtion; now of the gabion, and then again of the mines, the parapet, the battery, or the tenaille.</p>
                     <p>They had juſt began an engagement as we entered the room — It will be beſt related before the younger Carbine tells his ſtory. Let him therefore repoſe a little longer upon the bed.</p>
                     <p>The ſtripling troops were drawn up three deep in the centre of the room, and the object of attack was a large deal trunk ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right betwixt the contending parties. One ſide were to oppoſe and one to defend. The father was commander, and in good time came the brother, who, inſtead of repoſing on the bed as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, ſprung up with ſurprizing agility, and hopped away to head the adverſe party, making a kind of warlike muſic with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle drum tattoo'd by the timber inſtrument that ſerved him for an arm. Neſtor, meantime, aſſumed a whiſtle which ſerved for a clarionet.</p>
                     <p>The engagement was carried on in the exacteſt military order; they advanced, they retreated, they rallied, and they came on again.— Every little heart panted with ambition, every eye ſparkled with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of victory. The mimic ardour ſoon became real, and the two generals were themſelves wrought up into a ſerious ſenſation. Julius ſhouted, and Neſtor encouraged. But, preſently, the aſpect of the battle altered, for one of the <hi>beſiegers</hi> (a boy of uncommon bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very) took one of the <hi>beſieged</hi> priſoner. The conqueror flouriſhed his little ſoil, but the captive ſhed tears of ſlavery and ſorrow. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral on the worſted ſide affected to be diſmayed. His opponent ſpirited up his army, purſued his victory, took a a ſecond of the enemy priſoner, and the town (that is the <hi>box</hi>) was taken.</p>
                     <p>A ſhout of joy was heard on one ſide, while the poor remains o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the conquered troops fled to a corner that was the interior en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment behind the bed. Julius beat the dead march with his wooden drum-ſtick: but Neſtor and his troops, having burſt the city gates, (that is the box <hi>lid</hi>) proceeded to plunder. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all the magazines of the enemy, conſiſting of new foils, martial caps, belts, wooden bayonets, confections, and fruits. Theſe were the prizes of conqueſt. They were all fairly won, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017678_0061_0FA21F42811F3370"/>
divided amongſt the victors according to ſeniority. The little girl, who had ſat on the bed, now ſprung up, took a ſmall ozier-baſket, from a hook, and ſtrewed flowers in the path of the victorious, ſinging a ſong of triumph as they marched round the room. The ceremonies, however, being over, both parties came forward, and ſhook hands very heartily, in token of good-will, and then the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair ended with "God ſave great George our King" and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral huzza.</p>
                     <p>—</p>
                     <p>Our little arms, continued Julius, (whom I will interupt no more) were nurſed into early vigour for the field: for our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe bones—May every Saint bleſs them ſaid Neſtor— have been repoſing more than half a century, in different parts of Flanders and Germany, ſtruck firſt into that mode of training which my brother ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The traits of the mother were quite worn out by the weather. — In every lineament there was ſeaſoning. The ſun had written hero in our countenances, and we rejoiced in the dignity of the tan.</p>

                     <p>So much the better, ſaid Neſtor. We have had the ſatisfaction to ſee one of the raſcals hanged for ſheep-ſtealing, and the other you know is to be put into the pillory this day ſe'ennight.</p>

                     <p>After this, Sir, we had no lazy periods of peace. Some part or another of Europe was continually beating the drum or ſounding the trumpet in the ear of England. It was our duty to go forth in her defence.</p>

                     <p>Neſtor (continued Julius) tied the crape round his arm, and his ſoul was in mourning. He gave Frances to the earth. Decency —<hi>Go no farther,</hi> ſaid Neſtor,</p>
                     <p>—Decency required <hi>my</hi> attendance, Sir. My poor Carbine ſhed then the firſt tears that I ever ſaw upon his cheek. Oh! he was melted down into ſomething ſofter than his mother. He wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He kneeled down to ſee that it was put <hi>ſoftly</hi> into the ground. He let it go, and ſaid he was perfectly reſigned; then came away, and then returned, then went off a ſecond time, and ſought the grave again, wringing his hand, and declaring he was perfectly reſigned all the time —</p>

                     <p>[<hi>The fragment is here defaced, and illegible for ſome pages.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>— After the engagement the ſolemn thoughts again came on.—Julius rubbed his face twice or thrice along the pillow, and declared that while the wind continued in that quarter, his old aches would twinge him a little.</p>
                     <p>And in this hoſpital, Sir, we are now laid up for life, ſaid Julius.</p>
                     <p>He rubbed his face again upon the pillow. Well, ſaid he riſing, every dog has his day!</p>
                     <p>Upon this Neſtor began to whiſtle: — not one of thoſe tunes which ariſe from vacancy, but a whiſtle truly contemplative; it was more ſlow and penſive as he proceeded, and in its cloſing cadence, a tear ſtarted from his eye. Streaming almoſt to the borders of the upper lip, it ſettled there, and though as he waved his heed backwards and forwards, it trembled upon the edge of his cheek, it did not fall.</p>
                     <p>When he had opened the door, I ſtole an opportunity to put ſomething into his hand.</p>
                     <p>He took it as money ought to be taken by a brave or worthy man who wants aſſiſtance, and ſees no ſhame in receiving it. A ſober ſmile came into his countenance: but the <hi>tear</hi> continued.</p>

                     <p>Let it alone, my dear, ſaid Neſtor. IT IS YOUR MOTHER'S.</p>
                     <p>How are the Carbines to be envied, ſaid I when we were ſtepping into the ſtreet!</p>
                     <p>You flatter us, replied Neſtor, bowing gently. — I went two paces and turned back. — The tear had verged off, poſſibly while he was bowing.</p>
                     <p>It had got upon <hi>my</hi> little girl's face, and there it hung like a dew drop from a roſe-bud. — Good God, ſaid I, how rapid an exchange!</p>

                     <p>NO, my loved ſiſter, I will not, cannot, ſend a long ſtory. A few pages will compriſe the main circumſtances; and let thoſe ſuffice till days of future converſation. — Your father had ever an ambition to enlarge the fortune of his Edward by marriage: and Edward had already ſufficient to his wiſhes. He acquainted his father of the love which he bore to Louiſa. It produced a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. My brother happened to be preſent. He entered as your father exclaimed, "What but beggary can be expected with a girl like Louiſa Hammond, of ſcarce an hundred pounds a year?" — The converſation ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>Sir, (ſaid Henry to Edward, when they were alone) had any man living but Emma's father ſpoke in theſe terms of my ſiſter, he ſhould have been puniſhed for it ſeverely. — I love <hi>Emma Corbett,</hi> and to her he is indebted for—</p>
                     <p>And I love <hi>Louiſa Hammond,</hi> Sir, (replied your brother) but my father has an arm of his own, and that failing, he has that of a <hi>ſon,</hi> to defend him from the inſults of a boy, ſhould he <hi>dare</hi> to —</p>
                     <p>It is an improper place to diſcuſs the queſtion, ſaid Henry. They went out. Henry commanded Edward, in terms of intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeverity, never to offer his hand to Louiſa, while Edward inſiſted, that Henry ſhould deſiſt from farther engaging the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Emma. The inhibition was promiſed to be obſerved, and a breach of it was to terminate in the laſt frightful deciſion amongſt men. Edward dropped his viſits, and I knew not the cauſe. Henry did the ſame, and you were equally ignorant of the motive. I fell ſick; a fever ſeized my ſpirits, and my life was deſpaired of.

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017678_0068_0FA21F49EFD38F90"/>
with the herbs which are ſuppoſed to prevent infection. Regardleſs of this, and every other image of ſelf-preſervation, Edward ruſhed into my chamber, threw himſelf upon his knees by the ſide of the bed, and hung his head over my face, which received and welcomed the tender tears that were ſtreaming from his eyes. O! Louiſa, Louiſa, (ſaid he) I can bear it no longer! At theſe words Henry was heard upon the ſtairs, Edward leaped up — Heavens! ſaid he, can it be poſſible, is Henry returned? Well, it is no matter. My brother entered the room, and at the ſight of Edward ſtept back, like a man aſtoniſhed. Edward ran up to him, threw his arms about his neck, and inſiſted that the embrace ſhould be returned. Oh Henry, he exclaimed, too long have we mutually ſuffered a falſe delicacy to prevail. Enough have we ſacrificed to pique, for Emma and Louiſa have been the victims. I heard that your ſiſter was dying, and I could not deny myſelf the mournful privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of a friend— will you chide me for it, Henry? — will you ſtill withhold your hand and your heart from the brother of Emma Corbett? <hi>Will you?</hi> This was the firſt moment I had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the diſpute. The ſurpriſe was too much for me in the <hi>firmeſt</hi> ſtate of my conſtitution. In the condition I <hi>then</hi> was, it had well-nigh proved fatal. All which my ſtrength ſuffered me to do was to raiſe myſelf on my pillow, fold my hands in the attitude of intreaty, and with feeble accents to implore, they would ſpare my laſt moments, and not embitter them by <hi>their</hi> enmity.</p>
                     <p>Ere I had uttered this, Henry and Edward were weeping on the necks of each other, and Henry ſaid, alas! Edward, I <hi>owe</hi> you more than this, for on my part was the promiſe firſt broken. I have ſecretly maintained the uſual correſpondence with Emma, ſince ſhe has been away: and found the <hi>tenderneſs</hi> ſuperior to the <hi>anger</hi> of my temper. Indeed we have <hi>both</hi> been wrong. Henceforward, let us be <hi>more</hi> than friends — if poſſible, let us be brothers. Shall we not, my Edward?</p>
                     <p>Again, Emma, I claſped my hands, and a ſudden ſenſe of joy came over me that gave a turn — a <hi>happy</hi> turn to my diſorder. I recovered. It was agreed between us that the <hi>cauſe of the quarrel,</hi> and the means of the reconciliation, ſhould be equally a ſecret. The families were re-united, and none but Edward, Henry, and Louiſa, could account for the late coolneſs on the part of the two former. But the harmony was not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the ſame time Henry was permitted to addreſs you, and Edward continued openly his partiality for me. — Nay, your father at laſt declared, he hoped ſtill to ſee the two countries reſtored to the embraces of each other, and two happy matches to felicitate their union. You were, my dear Emma, fortunately from home on a viſit during moſt of theſe tranſactions,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017678_0069_0FA21F4B250D07F8"/>
and your Henry did not think it prudent to break the thread, of an elegant affection by the little jarrings that were happening to croſs it at home. The conteſt now became fierce on the other ſide the Atlantic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and threatened to carry bloodſhed and rapine to that part of the continent where Edward had property. Louiſa (ſaid he to me, one evening) I muſt croſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, continued he, as no man can tell the chances of the ſlighteſt ſeparation, I ardently wiſh to call you by the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt of all human titles, <hi>mine,</hi> before I go. <hi>Publickly</hi> this cannot be done, for though my father affects to conſent, our union would make him unhappy. No, Louiſa: let our happineſs be known only to ourſelves till it is proper to communicate it. Impart it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till my return at leaſt, to Emma, to Henry, or to any part of the family. I have my reaſons for it, even more ſtrong than thoſe that have been already related.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this converſation, Emma, we were privately married, and none of the appointments that led to the ceremony, or which ſucceeded it, were diſcovered or ſuſpected. Previous to the voyage of my hapleſs huſband, he put into my hand a ſealed paper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his will, and he deſired I would not open it till his return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the fond hope of that return being poſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have, till within theſe few days, kept the ſeal unbroken, and now, alas!

                     <p>Yes, my dear Emma, there <hi>is</hi> a fatherleſs Edward, and Heaven only knows whether the father had any knowledge of his birth before he died. I repeatedly ſent letters, full of all a mother's minute and affecting ſolicitude, but I received no replies.</p>
                     <p>To Mrs. Arnold, dear and generous friend! I owe the power of keeping my huſband's ſecret, not-withſtanding an event that promiſed to betray it. The poor little one was lately taken ill, and his death ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>My prayer was heard. My child grew well. Your letter came in the warmeſt, neweſt, and moſt melting moment of matron extacy. The ſmile of the babe was in my eye, and in my heart. I ſaw miniatur'd forth the features of the murdered Edward. Oh the beautiful extreme of rapture! It grew too big for bearing. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured my child with kiſſes. I ran with weeping joy to Mrs.

                     <p>Edward, the <hi>infant</hi> Edward, ſleeps as I write this. His gentle breathing is as the muſic of the ſpheres to his mother's ear.

                     <p>THE irreſolute note which I ſent this morning to your chamber, is not worth your attempting to decypher. I wanted to expreſs my ſympathy of your preſent misfortune in a way more anſwerable to the emotions of my friendſhip. I wiſhed to gather ſuch knowledge of ſome perſons <hi>connected with your loſs.</hi> as might enable me to plan ſome pious fraud to relieve your ſituation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wounding your delicacy. But I ſhould make bungling work of it, and deſtroy the felicity I intended to promote. I am a man of plain feelings, and have no dexterity of addreſs when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to adorn them. Accept then, dear Corbett, of an honeſt mind, in lieu of elegant manners. Is any decoration neceſſary to introduce a friendly circumſtance? — and if there is not, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do I thus lengthen the preface?</p>
                     <p>Corbett, I am one of thoſe whom the world calls an unthrifty fellow: for I value money merely as it conduces to my happineſs. My happineſs depends on ſociety, and not on myſelf alone, I have fixed it in the dear domeſtic circle that encloſes Emma and her father. Beyond that barrier I do not deſire to wander; and if I can promote their felicity, my own will, of neceſſity, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

chance I am become rich, you know. The ſum I poſſeſs is too much to be diſſipated, and not enough if I had a paſſion to accumulate. It is quite ſufficient to render three perſons happy, ſo far as happineſs takes its colour from money. Amongſt three perſons then let it be divided; but let only two of thoſe know the ſource by which the third is ſupplied. You may eaſily perſuade Emma to believe, (what indeed will be true) that by an unexpected turn, your loſſes are repaired. She will be too much rejoiced at the event to teaze herſelf about the means. Or, if ſhe <hi>ſhould</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, her curioſity is of a tender kind, and will readily be pacified. I hope you love me too well to make ſcruples; and yet I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare myſelf to combat them. It is really a very hard and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing, that theſe <hi>bare-weight</hi> duties betwixt friend and friend, ſhould be ſo rare as to make the offer of them a matter of embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment; as if there were nothing expected in ſociety but its etiquette and profeſſions. All I deſire is, that you will loſe no time in ſettling your affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no otherwiſe remember the <hi>mode</hi> by which they are accomodated, than as it may impreſs your boſom with tender ſenſations, and ſtrengthen the cement of that alliance which is formed between us.

Nor muſt you attempt to ſway her. Leave her to the ſame chances as would <hi>before</hi> have happened.

                     <p>Corbett is now as much recovered in health as in his circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and word is juſt brought that Emma is better.

                     <p>SOON after breakfaſt this morning, while Corbett and I were walking in the garden, he took hold of my hand, and laying it to his breaſt, ſaid, "Now, Sir Robert, is the time: my daughter is recovered. Take an opportunity to diſplay your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous attatchment. [Faith, Frederick, I do not ſee the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of trying to poſſeſs a fine young woman.] I will give you an opportunity, (continued Mr. Corbett) and pray Heaven it be in her power to give you the poſſeſſion of her hand and her heart!" —</p>

                     <p>Mr. Corbett informs me that Emma is now gone into the library, She is, he ſays, all <hi>tenderneſs</hi> to day.

Indeed, I wiſh moſt of thoſe things altered, with which, till I beheld Emma Corbett, I was perfectly ſatisfied. Not a ſyllable, however, of Henry falls from her. Surely that looks wells.

                     <p>I WILL not affect to miſconceive you, my only parent. You ſeem conſtantly anxious to connect me with ſome worthy man, as the aſſociate of my life; yet do not recollect that my choice is made, my principles fixed, and my heart <hi>inalienably</hi> engaged. An unſubdued veneration for truth attends me. I caught the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring affection I bear her, from the reſpectable authors of my being. It is a prejudice as early as it is amiable, and you ſhould not wonder if I walk ſteadily in the way of my directors. This, ſir, I have often told you. I have been brought up to conſider the happineſs of life, not as deducible from the maxims of the world, but from implicit reliance upon that power whom Heaven has ſeated upon the throne of the ſoul, as an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ring judge in all caſes of moral arbitration. It has been a hard taſk for me to ſtruggle with the various inflictions which have long hung over our houſe, and though the burſt of nature has ſometimes broken unawares, it was not in <hi>thoſe</hi> ſeaſons that I was the moſt unhappy. — When only the pitying eye of GOD was upon me, when I ſought the ſilent corner, and could ſecretly commune with my own heart, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into all its inclinings: then — <hi>then,</hi> my father, it was that the extreme of your Emma's wretchedneſs came over her; for ſhe found it impoſſible to wean her affections from an object, one ſo entirely and with ſo good reaſon approved, and now ſo entirely, and (you will pardon me) without any ſolid reaſons, rejected. I have not, at this period, my deareſt father, collection of mind enough for much argument; but you will pleaſe to recollect that it was you who firſt kindled the ſparks of tenderneſs for Henry. Beſides that we were brought up together, when gentle impreſſions are eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>reſervedly avowed, you repreſented him as an orphan of honour, talents, and good ſenſe. I depend on every thing you ſay, and was charmed with a ſentiment correſpondent to my own. The affection was full grown, and had expanded into bloſſom, ere you attempted to deſtroy, or even to check it. Then, <hi>all at once,</hi> you ſaid you had your reaſons, (which to this hour remain partly unexplained) to deſire I would think no more of Henry Hammond:
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017678_0081_0FA21F554B94DFD0"/>
yet, you averred, it was not fortune or any other circumſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to what to the world calls <hi>a good match,</hi> that created a change in your eſteem. Want of <hi>worth,</hi> I am ſure, it <hi>could not</hi> be; and yet you ſtill perſiſt to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I am glad this method of addreſſing each other by letter, though in the ſame houſe, has, by accident, been adopted It appeared awkward at firſt, but hath now the familiarity of a habit. It may well be ſaid, in <hi>my</hi> caſe, "to excuſe the bluſh, and pour out all the heart." Yet wherefore do I talk of bluſhing! Surely, it is not neceſſary. I yield not to any romantic pomps of paſſion. I make it not a ſubject, where it can be likely to create one diſcord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant feeling. I love with ſimplicity and truth: and it is far beyond my power—far, even as the preſervation of a ſolemn vow is from the breach of it, to change my object but with a change of its purity. The oaths that are taken at the altar, Sir, may <hi>ratify</hi> tenderneſs, but cannot <hi>create</hi> it: and amongſt the ſordid connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, it is not uncommon to be inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I do not think the law of the land, of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſufficient to make a woman happy. Marriage is a very hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable, but it may be a very miſerable inſtitution: that is, it may produce miſery while it confers honour.

It is not intended by Heaven to be the affection of a year only. It is to laſt for life. It is to follow its object through all perils and dangers. Its holy ardour is to burn equally bright and pure, and nothing but death is to extinguiſh it. Thus contracted, my father, in ſpirit and in truth, you will eaſily j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

injured — ſhe is aggrieved, my daughter. Her oppreſſions are at my heart. The ſtrings that fix it to my boſom are trembling for her. She glows with a generous love of freedom. She has been condemned without a hearing. She was ſtabbed into reſiſtance. The ſword was held to her throat ere ſhe thought of ſelfdefence. Conflagration, famine, and parricide, have entered her late peaceful habitations. The common bounties of Providence have been denied her. The blood of citizens, of brothers, and of friends, are flowing in rivers through her ſtreets.</p>
                     <p>I have not, Emma, been one of thoſe who hawk about my principles, and ſaunter in babbling ignorance from coffee-houſe to coffee-houſe.

I enter deeply, and pathetically, into every wrong which America ſuſtains, It is the only point wherein I am enthuſiaſtic, and it is the only point where enthuſiaſm is great and glorious!

Well directed, of what was it not ſuſceptible. He was above admonition, and kept erring on. In true tenderneſs to thee, my Emma, I forgot the dignity of age, and even ſtooped to intercede.

                     <p>I HAVE a ſuſpicion that Mr. Hammond is wounded; let that circumſtance, oh my father, account to you for the horrors of mind which have for ſome days locked up every power of hand and of voice. The former faculty is in ſome meaſure reſtored, ſo far at leaſt, as tremblingly to trace upon paper ſomething like an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your affecting favour; every ſyllable of which is as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed arrow fixing in my boſom. Your determined objection then to poor Henry is at laſt accounted for. I thought the ſanguine track of party was waſhed wholly from a father's heart by the blood of my brother. Shall political prejudices interrupt the fineſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of humanity? Horrid is the aſpect of battle, view it on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. It cannot ſhift to an attitude, nor take <hi>one poſition,</hi> to ſoften its terrors upon the reflecting <hi>mind.</hi> TO THAT it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly odious; nor is it at all amended by conſidering, that as it began ſoon after the <hi>creation,</hi> it will ſcarcely end till the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. It has, even within the narrow precincts of <hi>our</hi> family, divided the ſon from the father, and the lover from his miſtreſs; let it not be rendered <hi>more</hi> dire by ſetting the intereſt of the daughter againſt that of her moſt honour'd parent, ſince <hi>that</hi> would be to encourage the madneſs of mortals, and the civil peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that, in the form of a <hi>family-war,</hi> is gone forth againſt us. It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ould violate the gentle law of nature, and tear down thoſe conciliating ties which faſten <hi>kindred</hi> in one vaſt chain of connexion ample as earth, and beautiful as Heaven. You have painted your own patriotiſm and that of Henry, ſir, with equal vigour of lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage; at leaſt, you have ſaid enough either way to prove that <hi>both</hi> fancy the <hi>cauſe adopted</hi> is the cauſe of rectitude and glory. When one ſide attacks, the other muſt naturally defend; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, while the ſpirit of contention remains, ſome will vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently cenſure the very meaſures which ſome as vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

applaud. But, in avowing your own enthuſiaſm, my dear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> not, in effect, juſtify that of Henry? You both ſeem to hug to your boſoms a political Cleopatra, for whoſe ſake you are willing to gain or to loſe a world. England is to Henry what America is to you. Each inſiſts that he is eſpouſing the cauſe of an injured friend: and while this is the caſe, how can it be expected that <hi>either</hi> ſhould yield? In fact, would not ſuch a conceſſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcriptions of <hi>honour,</hi> in this world's acceptation of the word, be accounted baſe? You have, you ſay, attempted to direct the ſword of Henry on the better ſide of the diſpute. <hi>Which is</hi> that better ſide? Henry declares for Britain; you for America. What third perſon ſhall decide between you? The feeble voice of a woman will neither be heard or admitted. Elſe, might ſhe venture to aſſert that your countrymen are bleeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, while the point of right and wrong is adjuſting at home. This, however, is clear, my dear father, from your own premiſes: if Henry thought himſelf inſulted by the propoſal of changing his ſide, <hi>you</hi> would have been no leſs ſtung, had a ſimilar propoſition come from <hi>him</hi> to <hi>you.</hi> And this proves, that both are acting on what is called patriotic principle. What right reaſon then has the one to be diſpleaſed with the other? Yet upon this diſpleaſure on your part, you urge me to withdraw my vows. Are then virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſolutions ſo to be withdrawn, my father? When affection is faſhioned by the feelings, and long cheriſhed in a ſoul which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther projects nor practiſes any ill, whoſe every thought is ſubmitted to the holy criticiſm of Heaven, nor ever dreads the ſcrutiny — is it, under theſe circumſtances, of a texture ſo convenient, as to ſhift from ſide to ſide with every gale of opinion? Wherefore, let me once again tenderly enquire, wherefore did you originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire me with a veneration for ſober reaſon? why infuſe in me a ſteady and generous way of thinking? Was it deſigned for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or for uſe? If not intended as the <hi>governing rule of conduct,</hi> thro' every maze of this mortal pilgrimage, oh wherefore did you not at <hi>firſt,</hi> even in the nurſery, while every power was impreſſive and would have taken the form you choſe to give it —wherefore <hi>then</hi> did you not lead me into the path that I was to tread without ſtop or turning? Alas! you have given me fixed principles, acknowledged they were good, ſaw them with joy take root in my heart, and now you expect in their fulleſt growth, and fineſt foli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, that they ſhould ſuddenly periſh. But the habits of my youth are grown ſo ſtrong, that I feel it is too late for me to deal in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes. I will not now begin an artificial character. Oh! ſuffer me to implore you, ſir, to continue my attachment to Truth and Nature. I know nothing of State wrangles, or Congreſs quarrels. I mix not with the infuriate errors of party. I only act up to thoſe ſimple principles of moral life, which aſſure me that conſtancy in favour of a <hi>known valuable object</hi> (not obſtinate predilection to a <hi>bad one</hi>) is the baſis on which the ſuperſtructure of all that is noble, juſt, and good, muſt be raiſed. My wiſdom is extremely limited. It ſtretches not into thoſe maxims which deſolate the earth for a
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017678_0091_0FA21F5EB07401C8"/>
vapour of victory, nor does it preſume to penetrate the ſcheme of government. All it <hi>does</hi> pretend to, belongs to that ſmall and dear ſyſtem in which every woman ought to be inſtructed; namely, that a <hi>well-fixed tenderneſs</hi> ſhould never be removed, that it ſhould brave the ſtorms of fortune and diſtreſs, that while life remains it ſhould be the animating <hi>purpoſe</hi> of life to <hi>cultivate</hi> it, and that death, and death <hi>only,</hi> ſhould diſſolve the bonds which virtue had made. If my beloved father would for one moment lay the clamorous conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a bickering ſpecies aſide, and ſubmit to be charmed by that diſpaſſionate power which decides calmly of truth and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he would be convinced of this. I am ſure he would: for his nature is gentle and his heart is ſoft. Ah think wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </head>
                  <p>HAVING dined with a friend a few Sundays ago, at his villa within a few miles of London, I was, on my return home, overtaken by a violent ſhower, and obliged to put up at the firſt public houſe I met with upon the road. While I was there watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weather from a window, that I might ſeize a favourable moment to purſue my journey, without being in a dripping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I was not a little amuſed with a collection of draggled fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males; who, with their loving huſbands, &amp;c. were driven, by the torrents pouring upon their heads, to ſhelter themſelves under the ſame roof.</p>
                  <p>"Lord have mercy upon me!" exclaimed a woman of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſize, and rendered ſtill more weighty by her corpulence, "Lord have mercy upon me!" wiping her face, which ſhone like a cook-maid's, with her apron, "I am ſure this is making a toil of a pleaſure; here we labour and take pains all the week, on purpoſe to have a little comfort on a Sunday, and now you ſee, I ſhall ſpoil every <hi>individual</hi> thing about me; beſides, I am ſo fatigued into the bargain: but I told my huſband this very morning, that I would never ſet out again without a coach, or <hi>ſhay,</hi> or ſomething to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="unknown:017678_0092_0FA21F62449A3900"/>"You're in the right of it," replied her friend, a tall, raw-boned woman, with her mouthful of pins, with which ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to pin up her petticoat; "I am ſure, I will not ſlave myſelf to death again for all the pleaſure upon earth; and yet I'll not ſit at home all day neither."</p>
                  <p>"What's that you won't do?" ſaid a poor meagre, half ſtarved fellow, who was by this time come up to them with a heavy child on each arm. "I am ſure you have not the reaſon to complain I have, who have carried the boys ſo many miles; — you are never ſatisfied; but you ſhall carry them yourſelf the reſt of the way, or leave them behind."</p>
                  <p>Here, being hardly able to ſtand with his incumbrances, he was going to throw off his load; — his rib then called out to him in a raiſed, but not in a very melodious voice, "Don't offer to ſet my children down, don't, I ſay; do you think I will have their coats wetted, and their frocks dirtied? Who muſt clean them? Not you, I ſuppoſe, you will tell me, like a ſneaking devil as you are; but come what will, pleaſe God, you ſhall ſtand at the waſh tub till you drop; for I will ſee them all <hi>got up,</hi> to cure you of drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging me home upon my feet: and now we are brought into this precious pickle, I wonder what is to become of us."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, (replied her unwieldly neighbour) we muſt ſtay till we can light of a coach; and in the mean time let us call for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.—What do you like beſt, Ma'm?"</p>
                  <p>"You may call for what you pleaſe, (anſwered the diſtreſſed huſband, interrupting her) but then you muſt pay for it, as I have not a ſingle ſixpence left out of my whole week's wages — 'tis all gone."</p>
                  <p>"Gone?" cries his glamorous lady; "gone? Why, then, if we <hi>ſhould</hi> have the good luck to meet with a <hi>ſhay</hi> or a coach, we muſt be wet to the ſkin, becauſe you have no money to pay for it."</p>
                  <p>"No; but <hi>you</hi> have," replied he, "for I gave you every penny that I received laſt right, and did not even keep back enough for a ſingle pot of porter: I am ſure, I drank nothing but Adam's ale after my bread and cheeſe before I went to bed, which has made me as weak as a rat."</p>
                  <p>"Weak?" ſaid ſhe, "weak with drinking water? That's a <hi>good one,</hi> indeed! I am ſure there is not a wholeſomer liquor in the world."</p>
                  <p>"Then I wonder, my dear," anſwered he, with an arch look, "that <hi>you</hi> drink ſo much ſtrong beer yourſelf."</p>
                  <p>"I drink ſtrong beer? Aye, and ſo I do, or elſe how ſhould I be able to ſuckle my two twins, God help me! As women go through ſo much in this world, they had need of ſomething to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them; but men are always grudging them, and taking every thing for themſelves."</p>
                  <p>"Zounds! what ails the woman," exclaimed the provoked huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, "with her grudging? Didn't I give you all?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and then went and run up a long ſcore at the <hi>Black Dog</hi>; ſo we ſhall not have a farthing left to pay our rent."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:017678_0093_0FA21F6336C6A8C8"/>"Why, we cannot eat our cake and have it," ſaid he; "you wanted to come a pleaſuring, and let's hear no more about it."</p>
                  <p>The waiter now made his appearance with a bowl of punch, and a plate of cold boiled beef; and by ſo doing put a ſtop to their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation, as they all fell to as if they had not eaten a morſel that day, they had dined very heartily upon a fillet of veal, and a gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of bacon, and greens, at an <hi>Ordinary</hi> at <hi>Hammerſmith,</hi> and diſpatched a large quantity of ſtout beer, with a pot of tea, and ſeveral plates of bread and butter.</p>
                  <p>The preſent refreſhment put them into a tolerable humour. The mother of the twins took them by turns to the breaſt, while the father of them ſat down in the corner of the room to reſt himſelf till the rain was over.</p>
                  <p>When he began to think of ſetting off for the capital, the huge-waiſted lady ſaid to his wife, in a whiſper, "If you will lend me enough to diſcharge the reckoning, I will treat in return next Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day."</p>
                  <p>While this affair was agitating in one part of the room, a ſmart altercation was carried on in another, between a lover and his miſtreſs, who had juſt been caught in the ſhower, and were dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves over a pot of coffee. The lady was dreſt in the very extremity of the faſhion; her hair was ſtretched to above twice the length of her face; her hat was quite narrow before, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely broad behind; her <hi>Poloneſe</hi> was tied up with the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant air imaginable; and ſhe had a pretty little foot juſt covered with a white ſlipper with a purple roſe, heel, and binding. — <hi>He</hi> had his hand on her ſhoulder, and <hi>ſhe</hi> was putting ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ck. "Well," ſaid the lady, "will he wait?" "Wait!" replied the lover; "I did not aſk him, as he will not carry us to London under half a guinea; he is no common driver, it is a Lord's carriage." "Well, and if my Lord was here," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, "he would be happy to have my company upon any terms; and ſo you have let him go, rather than give ſuch a paltry ſum to accommodate <hi>me</hi>; but I ſhall not walk, I aſſure you, nor draggle my petticoats like the wives of your dirty mechanics, I did not attach myſelf to <hi>you,</hi> but to enjoy all the pleaſures of life; yet you are ſo ſcandalouſly mean, as to deny me the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies: but I will leave you—I could not be uſed worſe if I was married." —Here ſhe flounced out of the room, and I preſently ſaw her drive off with an officer in his <hi>phaeton,</hi> in which ſhe certainly muſt have been half drowned, as the rain continued to come down with great violence; and the captain was too genteel to have a top to his chaiſe, out of which ſhe was afterwards thrown by his driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too near a poſt juſt at the entrance into London, by which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both her leg and arm were broken.</p>
                  <p>The curious <hi>trio</hi> above mentioned having thoroughly lined their inſides, ſet out on foot, and became quite regardleſs of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; but their expences had been ſo heavy, and the reparations

of the damages which their cloaths had ſuſtained made ſuch breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in their pockets, that they were obliged not only to work harder than uſual during the following week, but to deny themſelves ſome of the loweſt neceſſaries of life; yet all their labour and oeconomy would not enable them to make an other excurſion when the next <hi>Sunday</hi> arrived; and as that Sunday happened to be a remarkably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Yet as I love you well enough to be honeſt — a bold word that — I will once for all ſpeak my mind, and I deſire your attention.

What are they, Madam, <hi>ab origine?</hi> Fops, Fools, and Poets would, in their uſual airy manner, tell you, that they were made of celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fire, that they were two animated balls of beauty, two love-darting mirrors formed by the graces, and a pack of ſuch fluff: But I ſcorn to figure away at the expence of fair truth. I write in honeſt proſe, Madam, and therefore in honeſt proſe I tell you, that thoſe ſame balls of etherial beauty, thoſe ſame love-darting mirrors, are at beſt two pieces of ordinary clay varniſhed. The varniſh, I allow, is good, and well put on; thanks to the ſound health of the father that begot you, and the mother who bore you; But what of all this? I am not ſuch a ſhort-ſighted, amorous pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but I can look forward alittle beyond the length of my noſe, to the time when the gloſs will all be worn away, when the japan of Nature will be utterly gone, and the devil a ſpark of fire will you have about you. If you live long enough, you will be purblind, and then what becomes of your love-darters? Don't be quite ſo vain, my young beauty. Another mighty matter upon which you have, it ſeems, to pique yourſelf, is your face; I mean ſuch things as we call cheeks, lips, and complexion. I wiſh it to be known to you, that I have but a very poor opinion of theſe divine graces, as you call them. Some time ago, I remember you ſhewed me, in a great air of triumph, a paper ſcrawled upon by ſome ſtorid puppy of your acquaintance, who ſwore, in very ſorry verſes, that your cheeks threw into utter deſpair all the lillies and roſes in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; your ſkin too, was, if I recollect, poliſhed marble; the veins were compared to the azure of the third Heaven, and the colour was whiter than alabaſter.

For my part, I never could be taken in by the tag of a rhime, nor the cadence of a couplet, nor the tranſpoſition of ten ſaucy ſyllables, ſince I was born; I always looked upon them as mere ear-traps. What a collection of falſities is here, indeed! I never ſaw a pair of cheeks in my life, that were fairer than a lilly, nor a pair of lips that were redder than a roſe. As to alabaſter, I will take upon me to ſay, there never was a woman's ſkin half ſo white in the whole world; and I ſhould be very glad to ſee a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion ſo well poliſhed as a piece of Egyptian marble. No, no; theſe flights won't paſs upon men of cool proſe. They won't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, PRISCILLA; upon my ſoul they won't. Metaphor, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, my dear, is a mere bam; it tickles the child's ear; but I heartily deſpiſe it. Not but that I give to a fine form its proper portion of praiſe. I am perfectly ſenſible to handſome features<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I like to ſee the proper proportions of red and white: I am very well pleaſed with a ſparkling pair of eyes; but I have no idea of calling any of theſe what they really are not, nor of comparing them with objects to which they have no likeneſs whatever. For inſtance now, your boſom is ſaid to be purer than the driven ſnow: If that isn't carrying the jeſt as far as it will fairly go, I don't know what is. Snow, quoth'e— Why, Madam, if a ſnow-ball and your boſom were ſhewn together, and any thing in the world but a poet to be the judge, he would ſay that you were a ſwarthy gip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey in the compariſon.

That a flower ſhould fade! A ſlight blaſt of wind in the night hath whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed it; the tints are dead; the colours are faded; the beauty is no more. Step now to your toilette. Indeed, Priſcilla, you are very pretty: What a face, what an air, what a ſhape! In the evening one of the thouſand enemies of handſome features overtakes you, and your ſecond viſit to the mirror ſhews— an ugly woman.

                     <p>UNgrateful Emma! perverſe and inſenſate child! You merit neither the pangs you coſt me, nor the tenderneſs you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from me, I gave you a reaſon cogent enough to have weaned a <hi>worthy</hi> girl from a thouſand Hammonds. To that I might have added the ſudden departure of a generous friend, who I <hi>now</hi> tell you (for I <hi>can</hi> hold no longer) would have laid his fortune at your feet. This, indeed, you muſt have ſeen, ſince nothing but the moſt extreme ſtupidity could remain ignorant of thoſe attentions which, for many weeks paſt, have been laviſhed upon you by Sir Robert Raymond, a man, oh inconſiderate! who ſaved thy aged father in the very criſis of his misfortunes; and, too delicate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as a debt the tender returns of love, which he would have ſued for as a favour, is gone, almoſt broken-hearted, away. I had promiſed to <hi>conceal</hi> his confidence, but you extort it from me: nay, you continue ſtill to doat upon the wretch who is fighting againſt all the beſt and deareſt connexions of your family. I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it. You aſſume the language of deciſion, and call it the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of reaſon. You ſet yourſelf up as a judge, and lift your wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's voice againſt the ſacred principles of patriot and parent. It is not to be borne. Let me hear no more on the ſubject. Ceaſe your threats about daggers, darts, and death. I look DOWN upon ſuch romance. Forbear to urge me. You are not to learn the touches of my temper. <hi>My principles</hi> are not leſs ſacred than <hi>your paſſion. Your</hi> principles! What are they? Airy nothings. <hi>Mine</hi> are the ſolemn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a lover of his country, and a deteſter of its oppreſſors, a <hi>aeteſter of Henry Hammond!</hi> Why will you drive me to this? I know nothing of his wounds; but if he has <hi>received ſome,</hi> there is reaſon to ſuppoſe he has <hi>given more:</hi> at leaſt his bloody endeavours cannot have been wanting, and every one is in the boſom of your father's native land. Your affection is that of a girl whimpering after a boy.

                     </opener>
                     <p>I CLAIM the aſſiſtance of a man whom I know to be generous, who honours me with his eſteem, and whom I venerate for the ancient friendſhip that has long united our families. By the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful force of <hi>all</hi> theſe feelings, I conjure you, on the receipt of this letter, to viſit my father. Aſſure him that his dear, dear image lives unimpaired in my heart. Tell him that my abſenting myſelf in this manner is not the truant trick of a girl who triumphs in the vexation of a parent, but proceeds from a motive moſt virtuous, moſt irreſiſtable, moſt conſcientious — from a duty that appeals to my heart, my ſenſes, and my ſoul. O let him not think that I <hi>glory</hi> in the neceſſity which takes me one moment from <hi>him.</hi> I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I weep, I mourn over it. I could wiſh that each duty went hand in hand, and that ſome of their objects did not lie ſo wide apart from others. Superior to every deceit, I would have conſulted my father even on the preſent meaſure, but he will recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the terror into which his late converſations threw me, and will then be convinced how impoſſible it was to riſque ſuch an ecclair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet even now I will forbear to juſtify my departure, becauſe I would ſuffer ſome reproach myſelf, rather than try to eſtabliſh an irregular example. But the Power who is giving me ſtrength to ſuſtain the great buſineſs I am about to undertake, has placed in my boſom ſomething which reconciles me to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Oh Sir Robert, there is a duty which <hi>muſt</hi> be performed— at leaſt attempted. Nature, reaſon, honour, and faith the moſt hallowed, all ſtir within me; nay God himſelf, at the marking of whoſe awful name I bow, ſeems looking down from his heaven of heavens with approbation. I may ſeem to be romantic, when I mean only to ſhew myſelf ſincere. All ſort of reſearch will be vain, I would not have yielded to the leaſt ſemblance of a ſcheme, which is moſt terrible to my nature, could it by any means have been avoided. My father will call to mind certain ſentiments, and do me juſtice in his own dear boſom on this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Sir Robert Raymond, I ever deſired to be uniform, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the diſtinct parts of my conduct with the whole. Yet I will bear up againſt the charge of impropriety in this one inſtance for the ſake of — but further explanation is unnece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>YOUR letter, Sir Robert, with its dear and dreadful incloſure, came to hand. It is now before my eyes, which are ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in penitence for the phrenzy which has baniſhed my daughter. I now behold the whole matter too plain. Oh, my friend, I treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt dutiful of children with unwonted harſhneſs, and in the patriot I extinguiſhed the parent. I expected that a ſoul like Emma's ſhould circumſcribe itſelf within the pale of politics. Curſe on the rage of party! Execrated be the tyrannies of war. Ah what are cauſes, countries, worlds, to the loſs of one dear child, adorned with the virtues of Emma Corbett — Blind, doating zeal: what haſt thou to do with an old man's heart? What, with the ſacred ſeaſon of the ſilver hair? Is mine an age to engage in theſe tumultuous ſubjects? No. I ſhould have taken my darling daughter to my boſom, and with an enlarged benevolence prayed fervently for the returning embrace of a divided people. <hi>That</hi> would have been true patriotiſm and true philanthropy. Inſtead of which, dolt and dotard as I was, I mixed with hot-headed gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in the affray. I intereſted myſelf in every fugitive breath of vague intelligence; and, while I talked of juſtice, I was encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging ſlaughter; wholly forgetting, or too blood-thirſty to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that either army is compoſed of kindred and of countrymen. Behold Raymond, how I am puniſhed! But where, where all this time is Emma? No date! No addreſs! A young creature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended, alone, of a delicate frame, and harraſſed by fatigue! <hi>Sick</hi> alſo! Never uſed to travel unattended — Oh heaven! But ſhe will return. The thought makes me eaſier. Let me indulge it. How tender will I be to her — with what fondneſs will I hang upon her neck, and hide her bluſhes in my boſom — how will I talk — how ſoothe — how conſole her — oh I will kiſs her into confidence and compoſure. I will even converſe — (pardon me Sir Robert, pardon the effuſions of a repenting heart) — I will even converſe upon her darling theme. — The name of Henry ſhall be mentioned, and if it does her good, not without tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Alas! what has the youth done, but — Yes, yes, Emma will return. She muſt. She ſhall. The ſlender and trembling thread of my being is ſuſtained by no other hope.</p>
                     <p>I have ſent advertiſements to the papers, inviting her home, deſcribing perſon, circumſtances, and ſituations, but concealing names. I have diſpatched various meſſengers to all the ports to have her tenderly intreated, almoſt cordially <hi>controuled,</hi> ſhould her romantic nature — for oh I ſuſpect ſhe meditates— Was there ever any thing ſo wild — But ſhe will never be able to carry it into execution, and I will not even ſuppoſe it practicable. She will return. I ſhall recover the treaſure of my age. But the interim is anguiſh — oh, haſten my friend to ſoften it. I am ſick, and Emma is not at my ſide. I ſee her not at the harpſichord — I hear not her enchanting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was lately adorned by the ſociety of Emma. Ah elegant and hapleſs girl! She has not only eloped, but engaged me to juſtify the ſtep ſhe has taken to her father. Oh Frederick, her language is ſo ſweet, her power over me ſo reſiſtleſs, and her firm affection for this happy Hammond, this heroic rival ſo reſpectable, that my whole ſoul yields implicit obedience to the very deſires which involve me in deſpair! What, of things poſſible, would I not do to ſecure to her but one moment's happineſs? Alas! my friend, ſincerely as I know you love me, I dare not tell you all that I intend to do Yet conſider a young crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about to venture on the wild and uncertain ocean, moved by a ſacred impulſe in favour of a worthy lover, who himſelf left a blooming miſtreſs, whoſe ſociety he conſents to ſacrifice to his country.

                     <p>There is a project, Berkley, rolling in my mind, and if on a little more reflection I can reconcile it wholly to the dictate that uniformly ſways me, I ſhall undertake ſomething that will excite your <hi>ridicule.</hi> But for any thing of that kind I ſhall be prepared. I have only two great powers to conſult, my reaſon and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. What they inſpire can never be laughed away.

                     <head>LETTER CXI. E. CORBETT TO HIS FATHER.</head>
                     <p>AFTER having been thirteen months agonized amongſt the wounded, and more than once conſidered as the prize of death, I am at length able to write a few lines to acquaint you that I exiſt; by which information, I flatter myſelf I ſhall make a father, a ſiſter, and a friend, moſt happy. The arm and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which were wounded, are at length cured without amputation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the half of the left cheek is gone. Theſe tidings I had cauſed to be conveyed to England long ſince, by letters ſent at different op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, by various means of conveyance; but as I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your replies, I fear either thoſe miſcarried, or mine have never reached you. Indeed, war puts a dreadful ſtop to this branch of communication, although the only one which can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the pains of ſo perilous an abſence.</p>
                     <p>WASHINGTON offers me the means of future retreat and inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, in conſideration, I ſuppoſe, of my ſcars. But I am now too far engaged to accept this with any honour. I wiſh it may be no more neceſſary to fire; and they <hi>talk</hi> indeed of peace, but there is no real proſpect of ſuch a bleſſing being at hand. I fought, at firſt, in my own defence, and muſt, I fear, continue to do ſo ſtill. The Engliſh perſiſt to call thoſe cowards whom they prove to be men, and feel to be heroes. To-morrow I ſhall once more fix the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017678_0107_0FA21E8A88515560"/>
bayonet, and ſhoulder the muſquet. <hi>Every</hi> man fights in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; we arm not for pay but for property, not for the wages of war, but for liberty and life.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore does my old friend Henry ſtay idling at home,
<q>"Now half the Youth of Europe are in Arms?"</q>
Why does he not take one ſide or the other, as principle directs? He was wont to maintain with me warm diſputes in favour of Great-Britain, but by this time his opinion muſt be changed, and the cauſe of America muſt be dear to him, were it only in reſpect of her youth, her bravery, and her misfortunes. Tell him I ſhould be glad to receive him here — to receive him, in that caſe, as a brother; and on thoſe conditions, too, we will both return one day or another, and enjoy the fruits of a double marriage; for notwithſtanding your reſiſtance, my father, I muſt ſtill remind you that I have a heart only for Louiſa. God ſend all together, happy, of one mind, and in one houſe: I care not in what king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or in what country.</p>

                     <p>CORBETT, the ſeal of Providence is ſurely upon my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize! Oh happy chance! I have at once ſaved and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued your daughter. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A violent ſhriek upon my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance betrayed her to me. Her man's apparel became no longer a veil to hide her from eyes ſo familiar with her voice and her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. She fainted in my arms.</p>
                     <p>The priſoners were too much involved in the ſullen gloom of their own melancholy to regard the diſtreſs of another. The paper which I incloſe, ſpotted as you ſee, with drops of blood from her own lovely arm, fell from her boſom. By the time ſhe recovered, one of the officers who had guarded us approached.— She look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him a moment (it being the firſt time ſhe had ſeen him ſince he came in) and then ſunk without any appearance of life upon the floor. She lay as a corpſe.</p>
                     <p>Oh merciful Heaven! — Oh God, great and gracious God! cried the officer, it is — it is — it muſt be Emma — it muſt be my SISTER.</p>
                     <p>Preſently, Emma and Edward Corbett (for it was your ſon, my friend) were both embracing upon their knees.</p>
                     <p>It was no time to explain. She was moved out of the priſon. I was permitted to attend. Edward Corbett in his own arms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed her to an apartment. He obtained leave of abſence from the farther duties of the day. He was the nurſe of your poor Emma. Oh, Mr. Corbett, I was not idle.</p>
                     <p>Waſhington happened to be quartered at the ſame town, prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manoeuvres of a new attack. He is eaſy of acceſs; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at liberty on a parole of honour, I gained an interview.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="unknown:017678_0112_0FA21E8FB4472208"/>Ah, can you not gueſs its motive? what <hi>could</hi> it be but the <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the captive Emma? The General heard the ſtory of her love as I related it. I concealed no part from him but that which had reference to my own former folly. I brought the narrative down to the moment of reciting it. The ſoldier's cheek was not without the graceful dignity of a tear. He wept.</p>
                     <p>Sacred, ſaid he, be the rights of hoſpitality: I am not at war with the <hi>affections.</hi> Ever privileged be <hi>their</hi> emotions. I feel them all. The beauteous priſoner is at liberty, Sir Robert, to go where ſhe pleaſes. I ſhall appoint perſons to attend her, who may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all interruption and inſult; but <hi>you,</hi> methinks, Sir Robert, ſhould continue to follow her fortunes as a <hi>friend,</hi> — you are <hi>both</hi> free.</p>
                     <p>I flew to Edward Corbett with the tidings. Emma had by this time acquainted him with her ſituation.</p>
                     <p>At what a moment did I enter the room! Your ſon was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, or rather <hi>attempting</hi> to pronounce, the names of wife and parent, of Louiſa and his little Edward. And have I then theſe bleſſings, (cried he) and is my father <hi>yet</hi> in ignorance what claims, what doubly tender claims, Louiſa Corbett hath upon him? He then preſſed his ſiſter in his arms, and they wept together.</p>
                     <p>Surprizes came too faſt upon the hapleſs youth. He knew not that Henry was under arms. He did not know that he was an enemy. Yet he dropped for a while the fierceneſs of the ſoldier, and acted as a man — as the child of nature — as the huſband of Louiſa, and the brother of Emma. Then go, my ſiſter, ſaid he, your career is too glorious to be checked. In contemplating your conduct, I riſe above all the prejudices of party. Alas, my ſiſter, I know too well the ſorrows of love and ſeparation not to reſpect them. You find me here the foe of Henry, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Here he ſtopped, Mr. Corbett; Emma beheld the gathering ſtorm of tenderneſs coming on, and exerting a reſolution more than human, as fearing ſhe ſhould be prevented from purſuing the great object of her adventure, which was even dearer than a brother, ſhe caught me by the arm, and ſhortened a ſcene too poignant to be continued.</p>

I aſk not the means by which Heaven directed you to me, but I feel the motive of your voyage ſo pathetically, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, ſo — ah Sir Robert, wherefore do you heap on me this agonizing goodneſs?

                        <p>Oh ſacred force of ſovereign tenderneſs! Emma has tidings of her Henry. Our enquiries have at length terminated in ſucceſs. He is now with his regiment off John's Town. Thither we are bending our courſe with the utmoſt expedition. I ſend you not the minutiae of intervening adventures. They yield to enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of greater moment. We are within one day's journey of the place.</p>
                        <p>By Heavens, Corbett, the roſes are ſuddenly thrown over the cheek of your child, and the pale of fatigue and ſickneſs, and loſs of blood, (which has not been inconſiderable) all give way to the joyful expectation of ſeeing her Henry.</p>
                        <p>Surely it requires only a generous effort to turn our diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to amiable account. To conquer affection is not, I feel, always poſſible; but to direct it from one worthy path into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the former is unfit or unjuſt, is aſſuredly in our power. Henry himſelf cannot adore Emma more ſincerely than myſelf. My whole heart is her's; oft it trembles, oft it bleeds, but the choice either to be the object of eſteem or the object of averſion is before me. Oh! I would not forfeit the partial ſentiment which my conduct has lodged in the breaſt of Emma, for any other earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyment. She owns me for her friend, her <hi>firſt</hi> of friends She talks to me without reſerve. She looks at me ſometimes till the heart's ſoft tear is in her eye. Ah, that tear! it is more worth than the poſſeſſion of all the reluctant beauty that ever gold, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, or importunity, extorted into their arms. I feel it ſtream over my ſenſes. Bleſſed ſympathy! Pure effuſion! Generous, glorious Emma!</p>
                        <p>I am penciling theſe informations of our route, ſometimes in the vehicle and ſometimes in a room.</p>
                        <p>Emma has this moment deſired the driver to ſtop. The door of the chaiſe is open; ſhe jumps out, ſaying to me in a whiſper, that a lucky thought ſtrikes her.</p>
                        <p>I will follow her.</p>

                        <p>God of all goodneſs! didſt thou ever create another Emma?</p>
                        <p>In paſſing along, ſhe took note of ſome buſhes which were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thickly with a dun coloured berry that cluſtered in the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I knew not the deſign of Emma in picking the berries till the evening, and <hi>then</hi> ſhe explained to me their uſe.</p>

Call to your aid ſome pious diſguiſe to ſave yourſelf and me ten thouſand wounds. Your preſence will wholly deſtroy the bliſs of the day — even of that day which gives to me the hand of Henry. Indeed it will. I ſee your emotions. I ſee your conflicts. They eſcape your ſoul's moſt amiable effort. They break through your boſom. I ſee them in your tears. I feel them in your ſighs.

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017678_0126_0FA21E9CA9F53218"/>
while I can diſtinguiſh—while I can feel one worthy ſenſation. But oh conſider, that the firſt place is <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> is Henry's— Henry my <hi>almoſt</hi> huſband.</p>
                     <p>He preſſes, he importunes, he inſiſts, in all the emphaſis of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der controulment, that to-morrow may be the day. He almoſt chides me for coldneſs of ſentiment towards him.</p>
                     <p>—Alas, my dear friend, it is your ſorrow, painted in your countenance, and in your late converſation when we have been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which produces this grateful reluctance.</p>
                     <p>I owe you—ah what do I <hi>not</hi> owe you? I would do much — I would do every thing that is <hi>poſſible</hi> to ſerve you.</p>
                     <p>The billet you ſent me this morning cuts me deeply. You there hint your deſign to leave Philadelphia. —</p>
                     <p>I perceive the motive; nay, you diſdain diſguiſe, and have in part avowed it. All but this, you ſay, you can ſupport. My dear, dear friend—author of many a comfort—ſoother of many a care—what would I give, had no accident of life produced in your gentle breaſt theſe ſentiments for Emma.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto all has been well — all has been great and glorious. You ſtill aſſure me you can act the only part that remains. Of that I am not to be told. Yet your friendſhip is attended by ſo much ſuffering, ſo much piercing ſenſibility, that even at this bleſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my heart bleeds for you.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE brought my pulſes to be almoſt as obedient as I wiſh them. Reaſon is not ſo weak a power as we make her appear. Her province is perhaps miſunderſtood, my friend It is not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, but a mild and <hi>genial</hi> authority, which ſhe ſhould exerciſe. The ſubjects of her ſway are the paſſions; thoſe of the <hi>tender</hi> kind are with the moſt difficulty governed.</p>
                     <p>I have applied to this our intellectual ſovereign on a different principle. I implored her, not to inſpire me with that <hi>indifference</hi> which is the uſual prayer of the diſappointed. The object of my love is married to the man of her heart. She obtained him at the price of almoſt unparalleled hazards. I ſaw every hope of poſſeſſion cut off. It was an intolerable agony. I bore it till I became al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſperate. I indulged the paſſion even till the indiſſoluble bonds were tied againſt me. I ſaw the madneſs of my purſuit, and retired — retired, my dear Corbett, not to meditate revenge againſt a happy rival, but to manage my own wretchedneſs, and to <hi>think.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A ſerious appeal from the paſſions to the judgment is ſeldom made in vain. We miſcarry, chiefly becauſe we are <hi>not</hi> ſerious, but only <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> ourſelves ſo.</p>
                     <p>I ſelected a quiet hour, and laid the ſimple facts before me. They were not elaborate. The woman of my affection (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hus I argued) is now happily married. She is generous enough to pity and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me for miſery that ſhe hath very unwillingly occaſioned. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents have confirmed what Corbett at firſt betrayed. I have too much contributed to her preſent happineſs for her to treat me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenderly: and yet my farther intimacy will increaſe her diſtreſs,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017678_0130_0FA21EA111216040"/>
even if it does not ſpread itſelf in time to her huſband. How bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly does ſhe pay for my former ſervices! What hinders her, now that ſhe is in the arms of Henry, from looking upon my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as inſulting and impious? Thoſe very ſervices. Do I then preſume, and perſecute her upon theſe? Oh indelicacy! oh folly.</p>
                     <p>But can I conquer my affection? No. It is not poſſible; it is not neceſſary. To <hi>extinguiſh bad</hi> paſſions, and to <hi>regulate good</hi> ones, are the two great points within the compaſs of reaſon. To covet any longer the <hi>perſon</hi> of Emma would be infamous. It is interdicted by law, by religion, and by God. But, are the merely ſenſual paſſions then at my age ſo very groſs, that by no exertion, no intereſt, I can ſubdue them? What will be the conſequence of my perſiſting? The diſtreſs of Emma, who now ſhould taſte on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of joy, the ſuſpicion of Henry, whoſe heart melts in gratitude towards me, and my own conſcious upbraiding. Can I <hi>ſuſtain</hi> theſe, or is an obſtinate attachment to the only point which reaſon refuſes me, (and which, after all, is hopeleſs) ſtrong enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me? But <hi>what</hi> then am I to do? Does reaſon bring with her no compenſations — no equipoiſe of rewards for puniſhments ſo ſevere? She does, and MANY. Shall I not rank amongſt thoſe the delights of a friendſhip not leſs <hi>tender</hi> though leſs <hi>intereſted</hi>— the <hi>ſecret</hi>-breathed prayer for one human being whoſe happineſs is dearer to <hi>me</hi> than that of any other upon the earth — the generous ſigh — the ſoftening tear — the ſocial ſmile — the ſelf gratulation — the fluſh of virtue, pleaſed with <hi>herſelf</hi> — the ſmile of Emma — the aſſent of HEAVEN?</p>
                     <p>Oh Mr. Corbett, we have glorious faculties, had we the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to exert them. We are afraid to <hi>begin.</hi> The heart trembles at a view of its labour. We venture to climb the ſteep, and are diſmayed. But every difficulty of ſoul and body diminiſhes by earneſt perſeverance. However cragged the mountain, or ſlippery its path, every effort brings us nearer to the ſummit; the ſecond ſtep is eaſier than the firſt, the third is ſmoother than the ſecond. It is the motive of climbing that gives us fortitude. When the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive it <hi>ſo great</hi> as to concern the happineſs of others, and our own duty is included, ſurely we ſhould ſtruggle to aſcend. I, Corbett, <hi>have</hi> ſtruggled — I cannot ſay how much or how long, but I can and do tell you, in the ſincerity of my ſoul, that though I am not, nor perhaps ſhall EVER be again a <hi>happy</hi> man, I do not wiſh either the death of Henry, or the alienation of his Emma's affection. I can ſupport the preſence of both, when ſoftneſs and wedded love ſits <hi>faireſt</hi> upon their features. And, tho' many a riſing tear warns me that it is time to retire, no ſentiment of irregular deſire invades my heart. Henry cultivates my friendſhip with kindeſt care; I do not impute to him, his <hi>happineſs</hi> as his <hi>fault</hi> I recede not from his embrace, though I ſeldom make advances to converſation that relates to Emma, and yet Emma is his perpetual ſubject, and his darling theme. Her own conduct is ſuch as correſponds with
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017678_0131_0FA21EA1B5C169E0"/>
every part of her former life. Perhaps there never was a more affecting ſituation than ſhe has to perform whenever I am preſent. It is indeed too much for a nature ſo gentle, and ſo ingenuous. But I will remove the effect, by removing the cauſe. Humanity ſhould not <hi>preſume</hi> to be perfect. I have carried a conqueſt as far, perhaps, as it can go. I have acquired ſtrength by an examination of weakneſs. Let me not ſink into captivity by fool-hardineſs. I have done much. In attempting more, I may loſe all the laurels I have won. Involuntary thoughts will treſpaſs on the firmeſt mind. Emma is a tender wife, a tender friend. Heaven continue her ſo, while earth hath a feeling to make life deſirable. But the familiar intercourſe of a private family is ſomewhat too much for me at preſent. I conſtrain Emma, whenever I viſit her, and nature impells my ſteps towards Philadelphia but too often — to appear reſtrained. I beg you will tell my ſteward to prepare Caſtleberry for my reception. I will return to England. There is no danger of a relapſe; but I am obliged to repeat the reſcuing arguments too often. A few months abſence will compleat my work. Henry and his WIFE —I wiſh, Corbett, I could write that word with a ſteadier hand — are happy. I leave them in the arms of each other. I —</p>

I have not dared to breathe this matter to Henry, and indeed the ſatisfaction which I receive in ſeeing him well, and you — O my generous friend — happy, would incline me ſtill to ſilence, were not my pains growing ſo ſtrong that I cannot any longer conceal them. A little, however, of that kind miniſtration which your ſkilful judgment knows ſo well how to beſtow, and whoſe good effects I have already ſo frequently experienced, will, I dare ſay, ſet all right again.

                        <p>You know my anſwer.</p>
                        <p>We are upon our return. Emma is very commodiouſly ſituated. She has a cabbin to herſelf. All that art could do in medicine has been attempted.</p>
                        <p>It is in vain —</p>
                        <p>— Corbett, SHE MUST DIE.</p>

                        <p>Her malady is gradual, but ſure — I dare not flatter you.</p>

                        <p>I went a little while ago into the cabbin, and found your lovely one, anticipating all the tender providence of a mother. She was employed in thoſe ſoft cares which the proſpect — the very near proſpect of her travail juſtified.</p>

                     <p>Two hours ago we arrived at the houſe of the unfortunate Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett. It was with the utmoſt difficulty his daughter reached town.</p>

                     <p>Corbett and Emma are ſtill together in the next room to that in which I write. The ſervants look amazement and diſmay.</p>
                     <p>I hear, methinks, the voice of my aged aſſociate in friendſhip and in ſorrow. I am called ſuddenly and haſtily —</p>
                     <p>Oh friend, oh Berkley: to what am I reſerved! A PREMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE LABOUR has been brought on by hurry, agitation, and fatigue. This morning's ſun ſees Emma the mother of a <hi>living</hi> child. — The poiſon ſeems not to have been in the leaſt degree communicated to this precious pledge. It is a female.</p>
                     <p>Alas! Emma would leap for joy at this circumſtance; ſhe would forget awhile her woes in viewing the babe whom Henry had bequeathed. She would preſent it with ſome teſtimony of mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tranſport to her drooping father. But that — even Henry's offspring can no longer ſoothe — for EMMA CORBETT IS DEAD.</p>
                     <p>Her death inſtantly ſucceeded the pangs of the birth. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at midnight. Her frame muſt have dropped in conſequence of the venom, which reſiſted the force and ſubtilty of all applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Soon — too ſoon — would the fair victim of conſtancy have ſunk to the tomb; but theſe precipitating agonies added to the reſt — oh, they were too much. She fell before them.</p>
                     <p>In the expiring moment ſhe called me to her — "'Tis Emma's infant: take it, ſaid ſhe: it is a parting gift — I <hi>can</hi> no more — my father — my poor father!" —</p>
                     <p>She dropped upon the pillow, from which ſhe twice vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to raiſe her head, and lift her eye to the objects about her — THEN BREATHED HER LAST.</p>
                     <p>Thus lived, and thus died, the moſt faithful and beautiful of women.</p>
                     <p>Charles Corbett ſtands fixed over the corpſe of his daughter.</p>

                     <head>LETTER CXLIII. TO THE SAME.</head>
                     <p>I AM juſt come from the moſt agonizing ceremony, oh Frederick, that can poſſibly paſs under the eye of man! — May you never feel what otherwiſe you can never know! Eaſy in your fortunes, quiet in your ſituation, unconnected in your intereſts, you can, happily for you, have no conception — at leaſt no perfect one — of that rend in the heart which is made by death, when youth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and beauty, are committed to the duſt—when the parent hangs his drooping head over the laſt ſad manſion — when the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans—</p>
                     <p>What have I ſaid? Youth, innocence, and beauty! — and do <hi>all</hi> theſe then go down to the earth's cold boſom? Shall none of them aſcend? The gloom of the ſoul carries ſenſation almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin! They ſhall ALL aſcend! The <hi>one</hi> ſhall enſure everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exiſtence to the <hi>others.</hi> Innocence ſhall immortalize beauty and youth.</p>
                     <p>I am reaſoning with an almoſt breaking heart, Berkley: while poor old Corbett, the ſurvivor of his family, in all the ſolemn pathos of grief, forgets every pain of body, nurſing that which is ſeated within.</p>
                     <p>The romance of youth may teach you to expect that I ſhould ſummon to my aſſiſtance every infernal power — that I ſhould tax heaven itſelf with cruelty, and take refuge from altercating man, amidſt the friendly concealment of impenetrable woods. This may, perhaps, anſwer the purpoſe of the novelliſt, but it correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds not with the nature of your friend. No, Berkley. It is not in a moment like this that the truly touched and truly tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves in outrage. The firſt burſt is paſt: that which began with loudneſs, with vehemence, and with vociferation, ſettles into the ſtill, the ſolemn, and the affecting. The temper, ſtormy and headſtrong, of Corbett himſelf, terminates in the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of dumb diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>The tears fall faſt from me as I write. More <hi>impetuous</hi> periods I have felt: ſo <hi>awful</hi> and ſo <hi>affecting</hi> a criſis, never. You, who knew not Emma, and have not a regular though you have a worthy heart, cannot know what I have loſt. The manner of her death — the motive — and the whole tenour of circumſtances connected with it, throw over every paſſage of the ſcene, a colour ſo moving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſad, that I ſit wonder-ſtruck in the room, and ſeem almoſt in my grave, with the world about me.</p>
                     <p>I have exerted myſelf to ſay thus much at the winding up of this ſolemn cataſtrophe, leſt you, my dear Berkley, or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, into whoſe hands theſe incidents may fall, ſhould preſume to queſtion the ways of ALMIGHTY GOD, which a re-juſtifiable in every part of this pathetic ſtory. Erroneous notions of puniſhment and reward are perhaps the leading ſteps to irreligion and infidelity.</p>
                     <p>The vile herd of novelliſts have done an eſſential injury to the cauſe of virtue, by ſacrificing to the pleaſure of the reader beyond
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:017678_0139_0FA21EA874CCD498"/>
the ſimplicity of truth. Difficulty, in the beginning of a narrative; love, in the middle; and marriage, at the end, make up, almoſt invariably, the recipe of a modern romance. This is called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding virtue; a bad character or two, perhaps, drops off, and that is called puniſhing vice. Falſe, fooliſh, concluſion!</p>
                     <p>Look into life. Doth not heaven's bleſſed beam ſhine equally on the juſt and the unjuſt? Are all rewards ſo mechanically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived? Hath virtue no joys of her <hi>own?</hi>— joys, which generous ſorrow only can produce? Is the ſacred ſtruggle of a good man <hi>altogether afflictive?</hi> To paſs through a road perplexed and thorny — to travel through an hard and difficult life, without tearing the finer principles from the heart, doth it require no better conduct than moves in the machinery of thoſe contemptible pages where all is given up to lettered art, and diſtorted imagination? Are there no ſweets in the penſive ſigh — the pious tear? Break they from the mourner without offering him <hi>any</hi> balm? Hath heaven born conſtancy no comforts? Conſider the life of Emma! Hath death, at once virtuous and chriſtian, nothing to lift the ſurvivor's ſpirit above every care of vulgar being?</p>
                     <p>Oh Frederick, I am touched by a very tender example. In la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting as I <hi>now</hi> lament, ſay, my friend, are there <hi>no</hi> dear and welcome mitigations? Yes, I feel—I <hi>feel</hi> that there are. Would I part with this generous grief? Ah no! What would I take in exchange?—The univerſe ſhould not buy it from me. I even an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the holy ſatisfaction, when I ſhall ſteal from the ſhout and ſtrife of ſociety to the tomb of a virtuous woman. Think you I love her leſs becauſe I no more ſhall ſee her? Hath ſhe ſuffered in my eſteem <hi>by her aſcenſion into heaven?</hi> Shall ſhe loſe as an angel, what ſhe acquired as a mortal? I love her better. The Omnipotent placed her in the path of my life, to fix and concentrate the beſt of paſſions. I am not of diſpoſition or age to change again.</p>
                     <p>Oh that the daughter of Emma may live! Shall I be content with a parent's <hi>common</hi> duty —to cloathe, to feed, to educate? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Berkley, <hi>whoſe</hi> babe it is!</p>
                     <p>I have hurried down ſtairs to examine my treaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>— it lives, it ſleeps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have felt its gentle breath on my cheek.</p>
                     <p>God will ſpare it. <hi>Louiſa</hi>'s orphan too is mine. <hi>Corbett</hi> too ſhall live. I have moved towards his bed-ſide often ſince I began to write. His face is hid—he will not yet endure exiſtence, but the hours of reſignation are at hand.</p>
                     <p>I conjure you then Berkley, to <hi>ſettle</hi> your opinions about Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.—Bring your piety to a point. Cultivate your tenderneſs. Love, like Emma; and if you meet with <hi>ſuch</hi> a diſappointment, do not transfer your affection, but turn it to a generous account. The <hi>vulgar</hi> effect of tender diſtreſs is diſſipation or deſpair. Had I yielded to theſe, a poor old man would have wanted a friend: two lovely infants, a parent; and I, the ſelf approving <hi>boſom-ray,</hi> which chears my ſpirit in this vale of ſorrow. <hi>Circumſcribe</hi> not, therefore, the rewards of Heaven.</p>

I would not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. The mad metropolis, I am told, is juſt illuminated for ſucceſs in battle. The houſe of Corbett is an example of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>either</hi> party have to rejoice on this, or on any ſimilar occaſion. It is not an enemy that hath done this great miſchief—it is, we may truly ſay, our late familiar friend.</p>
                     <p>I enter the metropolis no more. A few years only can be mine. They ſhall be engaged in reconciling my poor dear Corbett to life, on Heaven's own terms, and preparing for age a peaceful pillow, for infancy a nurſing cradle. Berkley congratulate me! My children are both well. The bounty of eke Almighty is upon me.</p>
                     <p>Oh friend, receive my cordial bleſſing: let your heart be kind, you life be pure, and — farewell.</p>

                     <hi>A SPEECH</hi> on the probability of a <hi>HAPPY MARRIAGE</hi> addreſſed By a <hi>FATHER</hi> to his <hi>DAUGHTER.</hi> From the French of <hi>JOHN JAMES ROUSSEAU.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>YOU are now, Sophy, grown up to woman's eſtate; and you are not to remain always ſingle. Your mother and I would have you happy, becauſe our happineſs depends on yours. The happineſs of a virtuous young woman, is to make an honeſt man happy: we muſt therefore think of marrying you. We muſt think of this betimes, for your fate through life depends on your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and we cannot think too much upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="unknown:017678_0142_0FA21EAB40FFC878"/>Nothing perhaps is more difficult than the choice of a good huſband, except perhaps the chooſing of a good wife. You, Sophy, will be this rare woman; you will be the pride of our lives, and our happineſs in old age. But however great merit you may have, there are men who have ſtill more. There is no man who ought not to think it an honour to obtain you: there are many whom it would do you honour to obtain. Among this number the buſineſs is to find one ſuitable to you, to get acquainted with him, and to make him acquainted with you.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt happineſs of marriage, depends on ſo many points of agreement, that it would be a folly to think to find them all; the moſt important muſt be made ſure of, preferably to the reſt; if the others can be procured too, ſo much the better; if they cannot, they muſt be overlooked. Perfect happineſs is not to be found in this world; but the greateſt of misfortunes, and that which may always be avoided, is to be unhappy by one's own fault.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſuitableneſs which may be called natural; there is alſo a ſuitableneſs ariſing from the inſtitutions of men, and a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs that depends wholly on opinion; of the two laſt, parents are the proper judges; of the firſt, the children alone can judge. In marriages made by the authority of parents, thoſe ſuitableneſſes that ariſe from civil inſtitutions and opinion are alone minded; the matches are not between the perſons, but between their rank and fortunes; but both theſe are ſubject to change: the perſons alone remain the ſame, in all places, and at all times; the happineſs or unhappineſs of the marriage ſtate depends, in ſpite of fortune, on perſonal and mental ſuitableneſs.</p>
                  <p>Your mother was a woman of family, I had a large fortune; theſe were the ſole conſiderations that influenced our parents to join us together. I have loſt my fortune, ſhe has loſt her rank; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by her family. what doth it ſignify to her that ſhe was born a lady? In the midſt of our diſtreſs, the union of our hearts made up for every thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the conformity of our taſtes made us chooſe this retirement. We live happy in our poverty; each is to the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all. Sophy is our common treaſure; we thank the Almighty for giving her, and taking away every thing elſe. You ſee, child, whither Providence hath brought us. Thoſe conſiderations which occaſioned our marriage are vaniſhed, and that which was accounted as nothing makes all our happineſs.</p>
                  <p>It is for man and wife to ſuit themſelves. Mutual inclination ought to be their firſt tie; their eyes, their hearts ought to be their firſt guides; for as their primary duty, after they are joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is to love one another, and as to love, or not to love, doth not depend on us, this duty neceſſarily implies another, namely, to begin with loving one another before marriage. This is a law of nature which cannot be abrogated; theſe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o have reſtricted it, by many civil laws, have had more regard to the appearance of order than to the happineſs or the morals of the people. You ſee my
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:017678_0143_0FA21EABA1DF3BF0"/>
dear that the morality we preach to you is not difficult; it tends only to make you your own miſtreſs, and to make us refer our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely to you for the choice of your huſband.</p>
                  <p>After giving you our reaſons for leaving you at full liberty to make your own choice, it is proper to mention thoſe which ought induce you to uſe it with prudence. Sophy, you have got good nature, and good ſenſe, much integrity and piety, and thoſe qualifications which a woman ought to have; and you are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, but you have no fortune; you have the beſt riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but you want thoſe which are moſt valued by the world. Do not aſpire, therefore, to what you cannot attain to; and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late your ambition not by your own judgment, or your mother<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s and mine, but by the opinion of men. If nothing were to be conſidered but merit equal to your own, I know not where I ſhould ſet limits to your hopes; but never raiſe them above your fortune, which you are to remember is very ſmall. You never ſaw our proſperity; you were born after we failed in the world. You have made our poverty pleaſing to us, and we have ſhared in it without pain. Never, child, ſeek for that wealth which we thank Heaven for taking from us; we never caſted happineſs until we loſt our riches.</p>
                  <p>You are too agreeable, Sophy, not to pleaſe ſomebody; and you are not ſo poor as to render you a burthen to an honeſt man. You will be courted, and perhaps by perſons who are not worthy of you. If they ſhow themſelves what they really are, you will form a juſt eſtimate of them, their outſide will not impoſe upon you long; but, though you have good judgment, and can diſcern me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, you want experience, and know not how far men can diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. An artful cheat may ſtudy your taſte, in order to ſeduce you, and counterfeit before you the virtues to which he is an abſolute ſtranger. Such a one, child, would ruin you before you perceived it; and you would not ſee your error, untill it was paſt recovery. The moſt dangerous of all ſnares, and the only one from which reaſon can reſtrain you, is that into which the paſſions hurry one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ever you have the misfortune to fall into it, you will ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but illuſions and chimeras, your eyes will be faſcinated, your judgment will be confuſed, your will, will be corrupted, you will cheriſh your very error; and when you come to ſee it, you will have no deſire to leave it. It is to Sophy's reaſon, not to the bias of her heart, that we commit her; while paſſion hath no aſcendency over you, judge for yourſelf; but whenever you fall in love, commit the care of yourſelf to your mother.</p>
                  <p>This agreement which I propoſe to you, ſhews our eſteem for you, and reſtores the natural order. It is uſual for parents to chooſe a huſband for their daughters, and to conſult her only for form's ſake: We ſhall do juſt the contrary; you ſhall chooſe, and we ſhall be conſulted. Make uſe of this right, Sophy, freely and wiſely; the huſband that is ſuitable for you ought to be your own choice, and not our's; but it is who muſt judge whether you
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:017678_0144_0FA21EAE1ACE6188"/>
are not miſtaken in his ſuitableneſs for you, and whether you are not doing, without knowing it, what you have no mind to. Birth, fortune rank, or the opinion of the world, will have no weight with us. Take an honeſt man, whoſe perſon you like, and whoſe temper is ſuitable to you; whatever he be in other reſpects, we ſhall recieve him for our ſon-in-law: his income will be always large enough, if he hath hands, and good morals, and loves his family. His rank will always be high, if be ennobles it by virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If every body ſhould blame us, what doth it ſignify? We ſeek not the approbation of the public; your happineſs ſuffices to us.</p>
