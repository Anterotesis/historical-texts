            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>We have had <hi>G. Fox's</hi> Will ſeveral times printed, (both in <hi>England</hi> and here in <hi>America</hi>) as it lies to be ſeen in the Prerogative Office in <hi>London,</hi> wherein there is ſcarce two Lines good Sence or Engliſh; and theſe two Letters are a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Learning; for by the firſt, we ſee, he could not write the date of the Year or ſpell his own Name right; how then was he capable to write a Book, notwithſtanding the many Books the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſo impudently publiſhed in his Name, eſpecially his Journal, craftily dreſt up by their chief Wits, that People in after Times might not ſuſpect the <hi>Quakers</hi> great Apoſtle to be ſuch a Buzard as he was. But this is <hi>Quaker</hi> Plainneſs and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
               <p>His Book, called, <hi>A Primmer for all the Doctors and Schollars, &amp;c.</hi> of 2434 Queries, wherein he is ſet up as Head and Tutor to all <hi>Europe,</hi> that the World might think him to be a Learned Perſon: This alſo is <hi>Quaker</hi> Plainneſs and Sincerity.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, his Book called, <hi>A Battledoor,</hi> of the Interpretation of 20 or 30 Languages, when he underſtood not one of them, by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001235_0005_0FB182E7E5FE8060"/>which the poor deluded <hi>Quakers</hi> were made to believe that <hi>G. Fox</hi> had the Gift of Tongues by Inſpiration, as the Apoſtles had at Penticoſt. But this is proved a Cheat; for it is diſcovered that the <hi>Quakers</hi> hired certain learned Men to do it for them: They gave one <hi>Jew</hi> Thirty Pounds to do the greateſt part of it, and <hi>G. Fox</hi> only put his Name to it, as the Author, to deceive. This is alſo <hi>Quaker</hi> Sincerity. Yet the preſent Followers of the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not believe this; ſo ſtrong is the Spirit of Deluſion, when once it has ſeized the Soul.</p>
               <p>Yet by the Mercy of God, ſome who have not ſhut their Eyes ſo hard, have diſcovered the <hi>Quakers,</hi> eſpecially by ſeeing what a wicked courſe this <hi>Fox</hi> took to anſwer his Opponents Books, <hi>viz.</hi> by picking 10, 12 or 14 words out of a Sentence of 20 or 30 words, and tranſpoſing them, and placing them ſo as to turn their ſound and Chriſtian Sayings into Hereſie &amp; Non-ſence, and then anſwer them as their Sayings. Nay, ſometimes he would charge his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent with the <hi>Qrs.</hi> Hereſie or Error he was writing againſt. And the <hi>Qrs.</hi> knowing their own Guiltineſs in this caſe, would hide it by charging their Oppoſers with the ſame baſe Method of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Books. But this they charge without Proof, only to amuſe. I ſay, ſome ſeeing theſe ways of <hi>Fox,</hi> are convinced that he was an Inſtrument of Satan, and not of God, and ſhewed them by what Power and Spirit he took upon him to throw aſide Chriſts Ordinances, and inſtead thereof ſet up his Womaniſh Inventions of Female Prelates, and his honourable Courts of Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, his Denyal of the Ordinances of BAPTISM and the SUPPER of our LORD, and counting them as Humane Inventions, Carnal and Deviliſh, is alone ſufficient to prove to all who are not bewitched with the ſame Spirit, that he was a Miniſter of <hi>Anti-chriſt.</hi> And becauſe all Chriſtians from the Apoſtles to his Time had continued in the Practice of theſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, he had no way to confirm his Followers in a Belief that he had Power to put an end to them, but by declaring himſelf to be EQUAL WITH GOD, and ſet up for a Worker of Miracles, by the ſame Authority as Chriſt did; for you ſhall find in his Journal, in the third Table, his vile and ſenſleſs Miracles are ſaid to be done by the Power of God, Not in the Name of JESUS, as the Apoſtles wrought Miracles, but in his own Name, by the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001235_0006_0FB182E9B7579A40"/>Power of God, To whom, (he blaſphemouſly ſaid) <hi>He was Equal,</hi> as his Books teſtifie. And upon this account the <hi>Quakers</hi> Idolize their great Apoſtle <hi>FOX,</hi> and his Inventions ſet up inſtead of Chriſts Ordinances, as the <hi>Turks</hi> Idolize their Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s And were the <hi>Quakers</hi> but in Power, and half ſo Numerous as the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> we ſhould ſoon ſee they would as little bear to hear their <hi>FOX</hi> ſpoken againſt, as they their <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And unleſs, it pleaſe God to contiue Watch-men upon the Walls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion may prove as dangerous as that of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> becauſe it carries with it a Pretence of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> under the Guiſe of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Righteouſneſs; <hi>Miniſters of Satan</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves as Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, whoſe End ſhall be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Works,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.15.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeak it with Commiſſeration; Have we not ſeen this to be the Self Righteous end of the <hi>Quakers?</hi> for never any right <hi>Quaker</hi> has been known to dye with a <hi>Lord have mercy upon him</hi> in his Mouth!</p>
               <p>For their Foundation Principle being the ſame with the <hi>Heathen Deiſts,</hi> as they Live, ſo they dye in the Mode moſt in voge among the <hi>Deiſts, viz.</hi> Hard without any ſence of Chriſt or of revealed Religion, truſting only to what is within them, the which, one calls Light, the other <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and in which both <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Deiſts</hi> do magnifie themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe <hi>W. Penn</hi> extols this <hi>Fox</hi> in the Preface to his Journal, for his wonderful depth in Divinity and his extraordinary Gift in opening Scripture, and would go to the Marrow of things. Therefore take two or three proofs as follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In his Book of Diſtinction between the Two Suppers, p. 21. he quotes 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 17.18. <hi>But</hi> Hymen<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us and Philetus [ſays he] <hi>concerning the truth erred, who ſaid the Reſurrection was paſt already, ſuch overthrew People from the Faith that ſtands in Chriſt, who is the Reſurrection and the Life, through which Faith they attained to the Reſurrection, and had their vile Bodyes changed, and made like unto his Glorious Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> How he preverts the Scripture both in words and ſence, to defend their Hereſie, denying the Reſurrection of the Body after Death; for the words of Scripture, <hi>Who ſhall <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> our vile Bodyes,</hi> Reſpect the time to come at the Reſurrection of the dead, but <hi>Fox</hi> will have it that they have <hi>Already</hi> attained the Reſurrection,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001235_0007_0FB182EAE3BDBFF0"/>and had their vile bodies changed. Alſo, he makes the Reſurrection that <hi>Paul</hi> Preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.19, 22. and 23.6. to be Chriſt himſelf, perverting our Saviours words, who called himſelf the Reſurrection and the Life, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> In his Book, called, <hi>Truths Defence</hi> p. 49, 50. in anſwer to his opponent, he quotes 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.29. and ſays, <hi>The Miniſters of God they ſpake to the Spirits in Priſon, and the Priſoner ſhall come out of Priſon. The Son of Perdition is above all that is called God in thee — Thou art one that keeps the Light in Priſon in thee.</hi> [And in anſwer to the Queſtion, Whether the Devil is ſtronger then Chriſt, the Fleſh than the Spirit; or, Whether doſt thou find he was ever a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in Satans Chains? <hi>Fox</hi> anſwers, <hi>We witneſs he was in Satans Chains, and is in thee, elſe how could they crucify him afreſh?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> At what a ſenſleſs rate he here perverts the Scripture, and all to prove his Blaſphemy, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that God is impriſoned, and in Bondage in Wicked Men, bound in Satans Chains in men: For the Spirits in Priſon, whereof <hi>Peter</hi> writes in that place, were ſometimes diſobedient in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> as the following words expreſly declare. But how could Chriſt in them be diſobedient, and not only Spirits, but diſobedient Spirits? Are not theſe Rare inſtances of <hi>Fox</hi> his wonderful Depth and extraordinary Gift of Opening Scripture, and going to the Marrow of things, as <hi>W. Penn</hi> by his wit has there Romanced? I could give many the like Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to prove that his underſtanding in Divinity was equal to that of his Schollarſhip aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>Surely (ſaid one) his Religion, Reaſon and Wits are all loſt, for he runs beyond Reaſon and Sence to defend his Tenet.</p>
               <p>Behold! how this wonderful deep <hi>Fox</hi> was confounded in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending this Hereſie, which was the hereſie of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>That in the divine Eſſence, there were three Names,</hi> but denyed that there were <hi>Three diſtinct Subſiſtences or Perſons,</hi> as <hi>Fox</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> do. Now the Name [<hi>Perſon</hi>] was warrantably applyed to the holy Trinity by the antient Fathers, for Reaſons too large to ſet down here; but moſt properly the name Perſon is applyed, becauſe perſonal acts are throughout the Scripture aſcribed both to Father, Son and holy Ghoſt.</p>

               <p>And you ſee above, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ingaged to Defend to the Utmoſt of their Power, according to the common ſenſe of the words; Therefore they have engaged to do it in Perſon and Eſtate, as their Ability, and Occaſion is. And yet almoſt in the next breath, they declare they cannot do it in Perſon. Can ſuch Equivocators as theſe be fit Perſons to be truſted in the Goverment?</p>
               <p>But will they Defend with their Eſtates? Will they pay to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain War or Fighting? Have they no mental Evaſion or ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in this? for we ſee (as above) that they have ſolemnly declared, they have none: Yes indeed, they have; for ſince the year 1660 'tis known to be the <hi>Quakers</hi> avowed Principle to deny to pay, and cannot pay ſo much as one penny to maintain War or Fighting. And this <hi>Samuell Jenings</hi> aſſerted before my Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi> at the Council Table at <hi>Amboy,</hi> the whole Aſſembly being preſent, <hi>viz. That they could no more pay towards War or Fighting, than they could Fight or bear Arms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold here! The <hi>Quakers</hi> have firſt engaged to defend the <hi>Queen,</hi> &amp;c. to the utmoſt of their Power, and that as Defence is commonly underſtood, without Evaſion or Reſervation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and yet at the ſame time declare their Intentions are, Not to do it neither in Perſon nor Eſtate: This is ſuch an Equivocating Contradiction, as is not [I believe] to be parallelled in the whole
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001235_0011_0FB182F288EC0EC0"/>World. The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> of <hi>Old-Rome</hi> are but Dunces to theſe <hi>Quakers;</hi> Let the Nimble Fingured Miller, <hi>C. Puſey,</hi> tell us in his next Print, how and which way they can defend the <hi>Queen,</hi> &amp;c. to the Utmoſt of their Power, and yet neither do it in Perſon nor Eſtate, and that too, as [Defend] is commonly underſtood; if he can do this, and clear his Brethern from the Guilt of Perjury, I will then be engaged he ſhall be ſet in the Legend for a Worker of Miracles along with the great <hi>Fox,</hi> and the reſt of the Saints both of <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-Rome;</hi> Mean time, let the World Judge of this peice of <hi>Quaker</hi>-Sincerity.</p>
               <p>But I muſt do <hi>S. Jenings</hi> Juſtice in this caſe, for he alſo ſaid, that they did not expect to be gainers by refuſing to pay; meaning (I ſuppoſe) that their Goods might be taken from them. But this is what they have always called Perſecution; therefore this makes the matter worſe; for here the <hi>Queen</hi> and thoſe in Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her are rendered Perſecutors, and by the <hi>Quaker</hi>-Chronicles paſs for ſuch in the next Age. Now this is at leaſt a paſſive Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law; and is not their defending in any reſpect, much leſs a doing it to the Utmoſt of their Power, heartily and willingly declared?</p>
               <p>I ſay again, What Government can be ſafe in truſting to ſuch a Quick-Silver Tribe of men, whom no words will tye, though never ſo expreſly ſpoken? And they are the ſame in moſt other matters. As in Swearing, they cannot in Conſcience Swear, but they can take an Oath, and their Conſcience in this Country is tayled to their Brethrens Conſcience in <hi>England;</hi> for the Magiſtrates here could not perſwade their Conſcience, [for ſome time] to take their own New Oath, till they heard that their Brethren took it in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>But now, Suppoſe the <hi>French</hi> ſhould beſet us: The <hi>Quakers</hi> count themſelves no way engaged to aſſiſt us in defence of out <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> Therefore they are free, (if any tempting occaſion offer) to Joyn with the <hi>French</hi> againſt us. For, as to their Saying, they cannot for Conſcience ſake bear Arms to Fight, or [as they word it] uſe Force and Arms; this is Deceipt and a Lye, as I could inſtance in ſeveral matters of fact: One pregnant Proof of this has happened ſo lately as the laſt <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the County of <hi>Burlington,</hi> wher a report was, that a part of <hi>French</hi> were Lucking
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001235_0012_0FB182F3ED462DF0"/>about a Branch of <hi>Anco<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>u Creek,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> thereabouts got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Arms, in a Military poſture, with their Guns charged, to meet the <hi>French;</hi> but you muſt Note, it was on their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, not at the Command of the Government, that they thus took up Arms; Therefore what their deſign was, who can tell, ſeeing no Credit can be given to what they ſay or ſubſcribe; but it muſt be either to Defend themſelves, or Joyn with the <hi>French</hi> againſt us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If to defend themſelves, that they ſo bore Arms, ſurely they ought much rather to do it at the Command of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No, ſay they we cannot for Conſcience ſake do that. And thus do they make a Stalking-horſe of Conſcience. This is <hi>Quaker</hi> Sincerity, being Hypocriſie at the leaſt, grand Hypocriſie, and ought to be noticed by the Government.</p>
               <p>Now let not <hi>C. Puſey</hi> in his next Print tell us, this is a Lye, and that theſe were no <hi>Quakers</hi> that thus bore Arms, for they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Quakers,</hi> Liſted as ſuch under the <hi>Quaker</hi>-Banner, by Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate under the hands of <hi>Burlington</hi>-Meeting-Men, and by them given in to the Military Officers; and that they thus bore Arms is too obvious to be denyed by any but ſuch as are endued with the above-mentioned <hi>Quaker</hi>-Sincerity. From which, <hi>Good Lord Deliver us.</hi>

               <p>SInce the fore-going was written, I met with the <hi>Quaker</hi>-Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack, put out by <hi>J. T.</hi> and <hi>C. P.</hi> for this year 1705. 'Tis a Two-handed Piece, wherein they wou'd make their Readers think, that they have Conquor'd me on both ſides. One will have me to be a meer Ignoramus in Art, and 'tother a Renogado in Religion, and conſequently it muſt be as they ſay, That I am not fit for <hi>Religious</hi> nor <hi>Civil Society.</hi> High Charges! But if this be the worſt they can do to me, I think my ſelf the more happy in that they have ſaid as bad of ſome of the beſt Men of our Age.</p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:001235_0013_0FB182F585C441E0"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to <hi>J. T</hi>'s Vapours againſt me, if it would edifie, or be of advantage to Mankind, I would Confute him; for 'tis ſome Errors of the Preſs which he harps moſt upon, and would make to be mine; nay, and he rakes them out of old Almanacks too; whenas he knows I could ſeverely laſh him with the ſame Whip from all his (calculated) Almanacks, and his Book too; but I have now other Fiſh to fry. His grudging me the uſe of his Book, is like ſelling me Roaſt-Meat, and then beating me with the Spit, but what leſs can I expect from a <hi>Quaker? Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> would have ſcorn'd to have done ſo by him, for copying after his Ephemerides ſeveral years in his Book. But in ſhort, he is wellcome to me to go on with his Yearly Calculations; he has, (it may be) more leaſure than I; and I ſhall make a ſhift to write an Almanack, (perhaps as true as his) either with his help or without it: And let him not be grieved that my Almanack ſells better than his.</p>
               <p>And as to <hi>C. Puſey</hi>'s Reply to my Almanack, he has not anſwer'd one quarter part of it, but runs upon other matters, to bring his Reader off from the Scent of their Hereſies: In his Anſwers he copies after the <hi>London-Quakers</hi> Anſwers, and dares venture no further than they have done to his hands. As to other things he ſees it his ſafeſt way to tell me, <hi>He has not ſeen the Books out which I brought my Quotations;</hi> and that he thinks is ſufficient to Refute me; or elſe he tells me, <hi>G. K</hi>'s <hi>Quaker</hi>-Books ſay ſo and ſo. But this is hard patching up Religion, when one <hi>Quaker</hi>-Book muſt be brought to mend or juſtifie another. And as to the <hi>London-Quakers,</hi> alas! They are baffled in their Anſwers, and Confounded to their perpetual Shame, by the Author of the Book, called, <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> in his <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Reply,</hi> as all who read thoſe Books may ſee.</p>
               <p>But has <hi>C. Puſey</hi> not one word to ſay to what I have charged of their Monſtrous Notions concerning <hi>Chriſt?</hi> No. They ſtill ſtand Guilty of the Charge often proved againſt them, <hi>viz. That when they ſpeak or write of the Chriſtians</hi> Chriſt, <hi>they mean not a word of what they ſay;</hi> for they will not ſay, nor dare not confeſs, <hi>That they believe in a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> now in Heaven, and that Chriſt is now, and forever to come, truly
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001235_0014_0FB182F6EADAF280"/>and really a Man, in true and proper Humane Nature, With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all other men.</hi> No, They have been ſeveral Times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to give us a Proof of their Sincerity, in anſwering to this Chriſtian Confeſſion, but they will not. And their refuſing to confeſs to this, bewrays them, and diſcovers the Cloven Foot to all Intelligent Chriſtians, and is another repeated Proof, <hi>That they Mean not a Word of what they ſay concerning Chriſt Without;</hi> and therefore are Implacable Enemies to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>And whereas I noted in my Preface, That <hi>Peter Fretwell</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Eliz. Fenton</hi> for being baptized, and that therefore ſhe muſt know a bitter Day of Repentance; and that <hi>Mary Wheat</hi> confirmed the ſame. Now if there be occaſion <hi>Eliz. Fenton</hi> will make Oath to the Truth of this before a Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>But behold what a ſincere <hi>Quaker</hi>-Turn-off they have invented for this. Why, they ſay, <hi>It was for her evil Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that</hi> Fretwell <hi>ſaid ſhe muſt know a bitter Day of Repentance for, and not for being Baptized.</hi> But do they tell what this Evil was that ſhe was guilty of? No, No; have a care of that; you ſhall not catch them there; for it was paſt their skill to tell that: They know that none of her Neighbours can charge her with ſo much as a Spot in her Life and Coverſation, thoſe many years that ſhe has lived both a Wife and a Widdow among them: If they could, no doubt, we had had it in Print, now at this Pinch: Therefore let thoſe her Accuſers think of what Reward they muſt have for ſuch ſlanderous Lyes againſt the Innocent.</p>
               <p>But why wou'd the <hi>Quakers</hi> now deny their Banters againſt Baptiſm? Is it becauſe they begin to be aſhamed of them? Truly I ſhould be glad to be an Inſtrument to bring them to that. No, but here is a <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> for they uſe their Arts of Confeſſing and Denying (as occaſion requires) only to avoid the Odium of the World; for beſides their former Outrage againſt Baptiſm (which they ſtill juſtifie) <hi>C. Puſey</hi> in pag. 3. (even while he would take his Friend <hi>Fretwell</hi> off from ſpeaking againſt Baptiſm) does himſelf bring a bantering Scoff againſt it, and falſifies <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> by perverting their ſence to make them
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001235_0015_0FB182F92B86BB10"/>ſpeak againſt it too. And all this he does under a deceitful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, That 'tis only <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> that the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny; whenas 'tis evident that both he and they ſhoot their poyſoned Arrows againſt Baptiſm it Self. Their Practice proves this to all that know them, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis <hi>All manner of Water-Baptiſm</hi> which they deny: They Practiſe none.</p>
               <p>Nay, <hi>C. P.</hi> has the Impudence to deny [after his faſhion] that <hi>W. Penn</hi> calls it <hi>Poyſon, to believe or have faith in the Hiſtory of Chriſts outward Manifeſtation.</hi> But what they expect to gain by this way of anſwering Books, I know not. But this I know, that ſeveral who were zealous <hi>Quakers</hi> have forſaken them for the ſake of this very Doctrine of <hi>William Penn</hi>'s, and that other, where he denys <hi>The Outward Perſon,</hi> JESUS, <hi>who was born of the Virgin, to be properly the Son of God.</hi> I ſay, the <hi>Quakers</hi> refuſing to condemn theſe two Doctrines of <hi>W. P.</hi> has cauſed many (and ſome very ſenſible Perſons, as they know) to forſake their Society, Thanks be to God for it. And as the Proverb ſays, <hi>'Tis an ill Wind that blows no body Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude with one Inſtance of what I noted before, that C. P. wou'd lead his Reader from the Scent of their Hereſies, by running from the Charge to other Matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You muſt Note, that I had provoked him to ſay (if he durſt) That they did the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that honour as they did their own Books, <hi>viz.</hi> as ever to read ſo much as one Chapter of them in any of their Meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>C. Puſey</hi> knowing their own guiltineſs in the caſe, inſtead of giving me a plain honeſt anſwer, he falls foul upon the Author of the <hi>Snake, &amp;c.</hi> and then brings Cirtificates to prove that their School-Boys read them in their Schools. But, Pray what is this to the purpoſe? Any body knows that the Bible is as neceſſary a Book to learn Schollars to read in, as another Book. But this is not reading them in their Meetings, as they do their own Books and Epiſtles. This is one of Friend <hi>Caleb</hi>'s go-by's, and this is <hi>Quaker</hi>-plainneſs too, which he gives inſtead of anſwers to me.</p>
