            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER TO THE PRINTERS.</head>
            <p>IT is ſome years ſince I received the firſt of theſe letters from a friend: ſince which I have been frequently ſolliciting him to conſent to their being made publick, and have very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his ſecond letter prevailed with him.</p>
            <p>The Subject is ſo intereſting to mankind in General, that the candid reader I truſt will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe any Apology for my offering them to his impartial conſideration. It is very ſurprizing ſays a late ingenious French Author, "that the Greeks and Romans, with ſo much knowledge and humanity had ſlaves like the Barbarians, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Domeſtics; it is ſtill more ſurprizing, perhaps, that chriſtian nations with the Goſpel before their Eyes, ſhould condemn their brethren in the colonies to all the horrors of ſlavery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>black.</hi> The firſt man, who ſaid to another, <hi>you ſhall be my ſlave, for I am ſtronger than you;</hi> muſt have had the heart of a Tyger. But the firſt man, who ſaid to another, <hi>I ſee you are poor, if you will receive your ſubſiſtance from me, you ſhall be my domeſtic,</hi> made a contract uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for both."</p>

               <salute>SIR.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Underſtand you have thoughts of being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the African ſlave-trade. My regard to the welfare of all mankind, and particular affection for you, leads me at this time to write you my ſentiments upon Slavery, and the <hi>ſlave-trade.</hi>— And I doubt not but you will excuſe my thus med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling in your buſineſs, when you conſider I have no private ends to anſwer. If what I ſhall offer upon the ſubject, ſhould be thought of no weight, it will only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt you a few minutes; but if I ſhould be ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to convince you, that however profitable the trade may be to ſome adventurers, yet that it is contrary to humanity, chriſtianity, the intereſt of the province, and of private families, I ſhall not only be ſure of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting from ſo vile a trade, but have great hopes, that your example and influence in this place, will, in time, produce an act of government to prevent the further
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010546_0004_0F8068EBFADA5C48"/>
importation of ſlaves among us; and I can flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the example of this province may influence others; but if not, we can be gloriouſly ſingle.</p>
            <p>Great-Britain, the envy of the world, does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſlave on her happy iſland; but gives to every one freedom, which ſtamps him image of his God.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon the arguments for and againſt the trade, permit me to contraſt a Briton and a negro ſlave in America, neither chargeable with any crime cognizable by the public—A Briton has the free diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of his time, to employ it in that way he likes beſt; all he gains by his induſtry, he hath ſole right to; none of it can be taken from him, but by his conſent; he may marry, no man can ſeperate him from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his affections; his houſe is his caſtle; none (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he has made himſelf obnoxious to the public) may intrude upon him. Happy Briton! The ſlave has neither command of his time, nor choice of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy; muſt labour inceſſantly during his maſter's pleaſure; can make no claim to the produce of his own induſtry; a bare ſubſiſtance is all he receives; and tho' he has labour'd 20 years, and earn'd his maſter an eſtate, yet even then he is liable to be ſold, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is, for want of employ, or for fear that in his old age he ſhould be a burthen upon the wealthy heirs. He can't marry, becauſe marriage is founded on <hi>promiſe,</hi> and ſlaves can promiſe nothing. They are indeed, ſometimes, to pleaſe them, indulged a ſham-marriage, which is diſſolved again at the maſter's will, without conſulting the ſlaves' inclination. He is ſold out of the country, and ſo ſhifted from hand to hand (if he lives to be old) 'till he is a burthen, and wiſhed out of life to ſave expence. Shocking contraſt! Whatever ends a wiſe God may have in permitting ſuch various
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010546_0005_0F8068ECD5D73F60"/>
fortunes to the children of men, yet ſurely no man can be juſtified in being inſtrumental of ſuch hard fate to any of his <hi>fellow creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Humanity makes us feel for the evils we know any of our ſpecies labour under; and unleſs hardened by education or cuſtom, we naturally reſent the pain or hardſhips of others; eſpecially, when we ſee them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on <hi>innocence</hi> by the hand of oppreſſion, which is certainly the caſe of all thoſe poor children, who are dragg'd from their mother's arms, and never taſte the ſweets of liberty.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have thought none but the harden'd wretch could have entertained a thought of planning a voyage to Africa with deſign to bring off its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and <hi>curſe</hi> them with perpetual ſlavery; even ſuppoſing they were in ſome ſort our enemies; but how is it aggravated when we know that the Africans are an harmleſs people, having never gone beyond their own bounds, to trouble mankind; and but for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption from white people might enjoy all the ſweets of a rural life; being bleſs'd with a fine fruitful ſoil, which yields with ſmall labour all the neceſſaries of life. This is the people who by ſome ſtrange fatality are pitched upon by the Europeans for ſlaves; and how are they made ſuch? not by giving an open chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to fight them that the captivated on either ſide may expect to be enſlaved; this would have the appearance of heroiſm. No! but the baſeſt means are uſed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the baſeſt end. It is well known we have been above a century paſt crouding our luxuries upon the Africans; and when the gold duſt of their land could not ſatisfy us, they were tempted to ſell their brethren, to purchaſe our intoxicating liquors and childiſh toys; thus we impoſed upon their weakneſs, and encouraged
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010546_0006_0F8068ED79443F70"/>
their barbarity by appearing ready purchaſers of their people for perpetual ſlaves: This trade for the lives of men being once eſtabliſhed, has ſet all Africa by the ears; all honeſt induſtry among them is laid aſide for the more profitable buſineſs of trapaning one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; all common confidence is deſtroyed; and indeed their natural affections are very much weaken'd by their immoderate fondneſs for our luxuries <note n="*" place="bottom">Chambers's Dictionary obſerves, that it is frequent for a ſon to ſell his father and mother; and parents their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for a few bottles of Brandy, and a bar <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>—Pray Sir, is not this inhumane in us?—But further, I find by the accounts of that trade, that when a powerful black Prince has collected by force or artifice a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his colour, they are offer'd to the whites for ſale; then an inſpector, perhaps a phyſician, is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by the purchaſers to view the ſlaves, who are ſtripped of every rag which modeſty had procured, ana male and female handled in a manner not to be related, to ſelect the ſound in wind and limb: in their choice they pay no regard to former connections, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife are parted, parents and children are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, the weakly wife will not be taken to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the healthy husband. Oh! methinks I hear their ſcreeches, rending the very Heavens, when theſe horrid ſcenes take place! the <hi>unhappy healthy</hi> are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately hand-tied, and then two and two are yoked by their necks like horſes for ſhipping, and drove in herds by their maſters to the ſea-coaſt, and ſtow'd in the hold of a veſſel: Owners are ſo greedy of a large freight that they croud the negroes in ſuch numbers and under ſuch cloſe confinement leaſt they ſhould riſe, as renders their paſſage almoſt intolerable. Upon a moderate computation it is reckon'd that 10, or 12,000 die yearly on their paſſage, and, in ſeaſoning, either
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010546_0007_0F8068EFDA5E07D0"/>
in the ſickly iſlands or in the cold climates, thoſe that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive are fix'd for life to their deſtined ſlavery—It is well known that the greateſt number by far of theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creatures, are fix'd on the Weſt India iſlands, where their fate in general is ſo extremely hard as to ſhock a humane tongue to relate or a humane ear to hear.—Tho' they ſpend 6 days in 7, in unremitted la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for their maſters, conſtantly over-looked, by cruel drivers, yet the maſter does not think himſelf obliged to provide food for his ſlaves; indeed he allows them Sundays to till a ſmall piece of land for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and carry the produce to market, by which they ſubſiſt—If one day's labour in a week is ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a man and his children, how exceſſive hard is it to be obliged to work the other ſix, for thoſe whom they muſt hate? I need not relate any particulars of the unbounded whippings which they are expoſed to, and commonly experience upon every ſlight offence. The leaſt oppoſition diſcover'd in them, or attempt to free themſelves from their miſerable ſtate is ſure and certain death, and that with all the aggravation that cruelty can invent, ſuch as ſtarving to death in the midſt of plenty, in which ſtate I have heard Gentlemen ſay, they live in a cage from 7 to 9 days. Oh! horrid! Pray Sir conſider, is it for any moral evil that this part of our fellow men, are thus extremely tormented? Can the ſtale and flimſy pretence that Africans uſed to kill their captives before we appear'd to buy 'em, juſtify the helliſh practice of the preſent day? even tho' it ſhould be granted that that was the fate of ſome; for without all doubt a much greater number are now yearly deſtroyed in the extra-wars occaſioned by the demand for ſlaves.</p>
            <p>The ſhocking noiſome paſſages, as mentioned above,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010546_0008_0F8068F10107BBA0"/>
beſides the ſelf-murthers they are drove to by deſpair, ſuch as ſtarving, or ſtrangling themſelves, beating their brains againſt the ſhip, or jumping over-board; the ſickly climates to which they are carry'd; the exceſſive labor to which the greateſt part are drove, which we may well think vaſtly ſhorten their days: for a ſlave of 40 years is ſcarce worth owning When you take all theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances into conſideration, I doubt not, Sir, but you'll be convinced that there are more lives loſt now among the Africans yearly, than before the preſent practice of ſlavery commenced; and that the Balance of miſery is vaſtly increaſed againſt them; and all this by us chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think that the ſcandalous vindication which ſome have had the effrontery to offer, will ſatisfy a lover of truth and juſtice, viz. that but for the ſlave-trade, the Weſt-India iſlands could not be cultivated to ſuch amazing profit, <hi>let them ſink then</hi>—Others have ſaid, that if the ſlave trade was prohibited, many gentlemen of immmenſe fortunes muſt be ruin'd, <hi>let them, and beg.</hi> 'Tis more honourable to ſeek a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by begging than by theft, as every man does who lives by the forced labour and privation of the liberty of any of his fellow-creatures; and tho' many a palliative have been compounded by ſome, even of the right reverend clergy for the conſciences of thoſe who have been troubled, in a ſerious hour; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they have been too modeſt to think them ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cures for ſuch malignant wounds. This leads me Sir, to addreſs you as a chriſtian, for ſuch you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be: and pray how can this practice be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with the great law of charity, ſo much applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all, viz. <hi>Do to others, as ye would that they ſhould do to you.</hi> I never found a man but was ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010546_0009_0F8068F18580F750"/>
at that ſhort ſentence, when apply'd to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject. I know indeed the great advantages 'tis pretended ſlaves receive, by being brought from a land of heatheniſh darkneſs and idolatry, to a land highly favoured with the light of the glorious goſpel; and ſo bleſs'd with the means of ſalvation. But let thoſe that appeaſe their conſciences with this ſpecious argument, conſider firſt, that we are not to do evil that good may come of it: and further, what a very ſmall <note n="*" place="bottom">I ſuppoſe 9 out of 10 are carry'd to, and ſpend their days in the Weſt-Indies and Southern colonies, where they live in companies, and not in private families.</note> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe poor tranſported ſlaves have the leaſt chance of being benefited by chriſtianity. For I take it, and doubt not you join me, that it is no breach of charity to ſay, that all thoſe Africans, which are carry'd to our Weſt-India iſlands, are carried from a land of ignorance and innocence to a land of glaring wickedneſs, where they have conſtant examples of every vice, and where they are likely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſeven-fold more the children of ſatan, than when in their native country.</p>
            <p>And as to thoſe few who are called happy in being brought into theſe Northern Colonies, very little can be ſaid of the advantages which they receive, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement they make of it, for from the beſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that I have been able to make (and I have long thought on the ſubject) I don't believe there is one in Ten of thoſe that have had the beſt opportunity that know any more of the chriſtian religion, except the name, than their brethren now in Guinea; and of thoſe that do know ſomething more than the heathen, how few have we reaſon to think are influenced by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and principles of our holy religion.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010546_0010_0F8068F2030FD040"/>I ſhall next point you to a few paſſages of that BOOK, the injunctions of which we confeſs to be univerſally binding upon all that know them.</p>
            <p>The jews were ſtrictly forbid <hi>man-ſtealing,</hi> as in Exod. 21.16. He that ſtealeth a man and ſelleth him, or if he be found in his hands, he ſhall be ſurely be put to <hi>death</hi>—I know that the Jews in their traditions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined this prohibition to their own nation; becauſe in Deuteronomy 24, &amp; 7. it is ſaid, If any man be found ſtealing any of <hi>his brethren,</hi> &amp;c. then that thief ſhall die— but even according to their explanation, they held that the thief was obliged to reſtore the perſon ſtolen, tho' a ſtranger, to his liberty again.</p>
            <p>But whatever diſtinctions the Jews made between themſelves and other nations, we know that the wall of partition has long ſince been taken down, and we are taught in the Goſpel to eſteem all men, our brethren eſpecially, thoſe who have not injured us in any reſpect, either as a nation or private perſon: of this we can not have the leaſt doubt, when we hear our Lord ſaying on the Mount, <q>Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, &amp;c. that ye may be the children of your Father which is in Heaven</q>—If this be ſcripture, or the word of God to mankind, and the enſlaving a poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent People, in the method now practiced, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent therewith, I acknowledge all my ideas of the words are confounded, and the ſcriptures are wrote in an unknown language to me.</p>
            <p>But if there ſtill remains any doubt in your mind whether the writers of the new teſtament had any reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the practice I am now condemning, pleaſe to read St. Paul's firſt epiſtle to Timothy 1 Chap. 9th, and 10th Verſes, in which <hi>men ſtealing</hi> is placed in the midſt

of a very black catalogue of vices, viz. <q>Profane, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of parents, whoremongers, <hi>men ſtealers,</hi> lyers and perjured perſons, &amp;c. all which are contrary to ſound doctrine according to the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God.</q>—How trifling muſt be the excuſe, which ſome, who hold ſlaves, have made, viz. That they are not men ſtealers, having bought them with their money: that they would not be concerned in the trade upon any account, but ſeeing they are brought here, and will be ſold to ſomebody, they may as well buy as others, they will treat 'em as well or better. Oh! ye fools or knaves, for in one of theſe claſſes I think you muſt be ranked, Is reaſon to be blinded with ſuch a thin veil? Is the moſt valuable bleſſing in life, <hi>liberty,</hi> to be thus trifled with?—It is moſt certain that were there no purchaſers, there would be no ſellers—the proſpect of a market here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to thoſe who employ ſlaves, is the ſole cauſe, and conſtant ſupport, of that ungenerous and wicked trade. I don't conceive a whit odds between the man who goes perſonally and ſteals a negro lad from his parents hut, in Guinea, and brings him here, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves him for life, and the man who purchaſes one, that others have brought here: except in the firſt caſe, ſome degree of courage is requiſite, which is valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in its ſelf,—in the latter caſe there is baſeneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite meanneſs without the ſhadow of a virtue—Were we expoſed to the ſame curſe, ſhould not we think that the abettors of our miſery, were the children of the devil, ſuffered by the wrath of God to dwell on the Earth, to encreaſe the heavy load of human woes? Can any who are concerned in this black helliſh buſineſs, pretend to the character of chriſtians? I can't conclude this part, without making the following application to

any one that ever purchaſed a ſlave. Can you lay your hand on your breaſt, and declare in the preſence of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that you verily think, after the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſideration, that in purchaſing one of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race as innocent as yourſelf, and making him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurvient to your ſovereign will, all his days, without a chance of freedom, that you in no reſpect deviate from that <hi>rule</hi> laid down by Chriſt, <hi>whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them</hi>—if you can ſay thus, and think you ſhall be able to ſay ſo, when cloſing the ſcene of this life, and have no compunctions of conſcience in your laſt moments, for having ſo far promoted and encouraged the ſlave trade, as to be a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer; if this is your ſober thoughts, go on, buy more, dip largely in the trade, for it is profitable, and blacken theſe fair northern climates, as the Weſt-Indies are <hi>black.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I next propoſe, Sir, is, to ſhow that the ſlave trade is inconſiſtent with the intereſt of the Province; and I doubt not but that alone would be a ſufficient reaſon with you to deſiſt.</p>
            <p>By the importation of black ſlaves, we prevent the importation of white ſervants; and it is well known that there are thouſands in Europe, who would gladly come among us, and might be brought here for a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the coſt of a black man: theſe white people would do all the labour for us, that we have any right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from others; thoſe that cannot pay a paſſage, muſt doubtleſs ſell part of their time for it; after that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, they can let themſelves as ſervants at as low a rate as a negro can be maintained, reckoning his coſt, the riſque of his life, &amp;c. (perhaps I may in my next give you an account of the particulars of the annual coſt of a ſlave) Theſe white people when they have ſerved ſome years in the loweſt capacities, turn out

upon our waſte-lands, marry and in a few years we ſee a Town well ſettled; and in leſs than fifty years, there will be four fold increaſe: by this means our country will fill up, we become reſpectable, and ſecure from an enemy, and furniſhed with every conveniency of life: Tho' it has been plead, that prohibiting the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſlaves, would cut off a large branch of trade, yet it muſt be remembered that upon the whole, it is an unprofitable one for the community, becauſe real riches (if rum may be called ſo) are ſent from this place for an article which we either might have from among ourſelves, or we might import with little or no expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and tho' individuals may make a good advance upon their ſtock, yet the riches are wholly got from ourſelves, a trade which you well know Sir, is always eſteem'd diſadvantageous to a community. I take it to be the policy of a ſtate to conſult meaſures to have the greateſt number of laborers, and thoſe ſo intereſted in the welfare of the community, as to be always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and ready to ſupport and defend it: But how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all this is the policy of ſuffering the importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſett of people, which at beſt puts a gain into the pockets of but a few men, and indulges the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and haughty tempers of a few more; inſtead of being a defence and ſupport of the common wealth, are often its terror, and ſometimes its deſtruction: For it muſt be conſtantly expected that a ſlave will improve every opportunity to throw off his burthen, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: New-York, &amp; moſt of the Southern colonies, and Weſt-Indies, have experienced ſomething of that, which is enough to make all thoſe that ſet a juſt value upon domeſtic ſecurity, to tremble: it has been objected that their numbers are at preſent ſo inconſiderable, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that can be feared. I grant it for the preſent,
<pb n="14"
                   facs="unknown:010546_0014_0F8068F6AA8479C8"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
but what ſecurity have we that this will be the caſe long. I will remind you of another great evil to the community, conſequent upon our having black ſlaves which doubtleſs you have obſerved, and that is, the great inconvenience our poorer ſort of People are put to by this means, who would gladly ſerve us for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but then they muſt be upon a level with negro ſlaves; they being born free, can't think of ſuch a diſgrace as they eſteem it, and ſo often ſpend their youth in idleneſs, and for want of proper employ and government then, become ever after poor vagrants; and as to the female part of our poor youth, its too well known what courſes they often take, and rather than work in the low employments, chuſe to truſt their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for a living,—This is big with evils, that I ſhall not pretend to enlarge upon—</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conſider, as I promiſed in the beginning, how this trade affects private families; and evils that begin there ſeldom end 'till the public feel them. When a ſlave is introduced into a family, at once commences an amazing diſtinction: they are indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us allowed to be of the human ſpecies; yet ſo very inferior, as ſcarcely to be intitled to any of its priviledges: Nay, when I think of it, I don't know of one priviledge they have above the brutes; for as to eating, drinking and ſleeping, they are allowed them for the ſame reaſon that the beaſts are, to ſupport life and vigour, to do our labour; but as to <hi>choice</hi> or <hi>property,</hi> it is certain they can have none: Notwithſtanding, I ſay, they are allowed by us to be of our ſpecies, yet ſo very low, that the firſt idea which children have of ſlaves, is, that they are not intitled to the ſame tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor even juſtice, that whites are. This produces an haughty and imperious conduct towards them, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010546_0015_0F8068F798CC09A8"/>
often cruelty; this ſpirit indulged towards the ſervants of the family, naturally influences their behaviour to all they eſteem their inferiors in any ſort, and ten to one this temper grows up with them, and they ever after be deſpiſed by the wiſe and humane, and hated by all.—All writers upon the education of youth, have held it a ſacred point to keep the minds of children as ſuſceptible as poſſible, of kindneſs and compaſſion, for their fellow creatures. I think the great Mr. Lock, would not have them familiar to hurting any of the domeſtic animals, leaſt that heavenly ſpark, <hi>compaſſion,</hi> ſhould be extinguiſhed, or prevented growing into that flame, which is the light and glory of the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.—But I fear your patience is exhauſted, and ſo conclude,</p>

            <p>THIS brings you my conſent to publiſh the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I wrote you ſome years ago, upon the African ſlave trade: My objection aroſe from a hope that ſome abler hand would undertake a ſubject, in my apprehenſion, worthy the beſt head and beſt heart: But as yet nothing has appeared, tho' the very enlarged ſentiments of Liberty which have lately prevailed, among all ranks of people, one would think, naturally tended to raiſe up many writers againſt that cruel practice of enſlaving the <hi>Blacks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has always appeared very ſtrange to me, how people can be ſo ſenſibly affected with what has but a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010546_0018_0F8068FCA09C8E78"/>
remote tendency to deprive them of their ſmalleſt right or priviledge, and yet remain ſo inſenſible of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate of ſo many of our ſpecies that live among us; and further, can actually plan and execute the moſt ſordid views of gain, at the expence of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and every priviledge <hi>(held dear by all mankind)</hi> of thoſe poor Africans, whom the white pleople have ſtrangely fix'd upon as the objects of their rapine.</p>
            <p>With what conſiſtency can an American-Captain, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the Guinea Coaſt for ſlaves, open his mouth and plead for liberty, and his natural rights? Perhaps the ignorance and poverty of ſome of that ſett of men may be offer'd, as an extenuation of their guilt; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as they'll immediately aſk, why do the learned and rich, and even profeſſed chriſtians engage in the ſame traffic, and yet talk loudly of liberty, civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and tell us that without liberty, and the free diſpoſal of a man's time &amp; property, life itſelf is not worth having? When an Engliſhman would paint the greateſt curſe that can befall him, it is to be no better off than an African ſlave; and yet he will deliberately plan a ſcheme to increaſe the number of theſe wretches, with no greater temptation perhaps than to add a few more pounds to his crowded bags. Oh miſerable ſlaves to wealth! did you never once conſider your baſeneſs as men, thus to plot and deſign the ruin of ſo many of your harmleſs fellow creatures? Can you conſider your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as enjoying the bleſſings of the Britiſh conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe firſt principle is the ſecurity of your liberty and property; and feel no pity or compaſſion for thoſe unhappy people, whoſe lot has fallen under the ſevere rod of tyranny and oppreſſion? Can you deviſe to rob them of thoſe few remains of liberty, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and not only break up their tendereſt connections,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010546_0019_0F8068FD587BE9F0"/>
but drag them into every part of the American world, and put them into the power of even the greateſt villian, if he has money to purchaſe? Is this the effect of your progreſs in all the noble arts and ſciences? is this the effect of your chriſtian knowledge? Shameful fruit! Oh! ye ſons of liberty, pauſe a moment, give me your ear, Is your conduct conſiſtent? can you review our late ſtruggles for liberty, and think of the ſlave-trade at the ſame time, and not bluſh? Methinks were you an African, I could ſee you bluſh. How ſhould we have been confounded and ſtruck dumb, had Great Britain thrown this inconſiſtency in our faces? how juſtly might they, and all mankind have laughed at our pretenſions to any juſt ſentiments of Liberty, or even humanity? We claim our deſcent from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Britons, who have reſolved from time to time, that no inhabitant of their iſland ſhall be a ſlave; and ſhall we, whoſe Fathers fled to America for greater Liberty than they enjoyed in Britain; ſhall we, I ſay, ſuffer Slavery to be ſo much as once named among us?— The years 1765 &amp; 1766, will be ever memorable for the glorious ſtand which America has made for her Liberties; how much glory will it add to us, if at the time we are eſtabliſhing Liberty for ourſelves and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we ſhow the ſame regard to all mankind that come among us? that while we are preventing the chains being put upon us, we are knocking them off from thoſe who already have them on?—This will ſhew all the world, that we are true ſons of Liberty, and will be expreſſive of ſuch noble, diſintereſted and generous ſentiments, as will give us the higheſt eſteem among mankind, and will for ever prevent any bad miniſtry harbouring a thought of making the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement upon our privileges; for the people that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010546_0020_0F8068FE160596A8"/>
will forego ſo lucrative a trade, on ſuch principles, muſt be a noble, muſt be an unconquerable people.</p>
            <p>I can't but hope this ſubject will appear of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to moſt people: If ſo, no doubt the honorable houſe of Repreſentatives, and the other branches of Government, will take it into their moſt ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and rejoice to have the opportunity, and be the means of fixing ſuch laſting honor upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they repreſent and govern. Oh! what heart-felt joy muſt poſſeſs the breaſt of every one, while he is taſting the ſweets of Liberty, while he is ſetting under his own fig-tree, and under his own vine, while he is delighting himſelf with his ſweet companion, and his ſmilling offspring around him, and none to make him afraid; if at the ſame time he is conſcious that he has done his utmoſt that all his fellow-men might enjoy the ſame happineſs?—It is not for me to point out to my ſuperiours what particular laws are neceſſary to be made, to effect ſo noble and chriſtian a deſign. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, it will be thought neceſſary immediately to prohibit any future importation of ſlaves, which, as Dr. Franklin ſays, has already blackened half America. —As we are one of the greateſt colonies, and have in more inſtances than one, given the lead in affairs of high importance; let us not wait for the example of any other of our ſiſter colonies: It is praiſe-worthy to follow good examples: but much more ſo to ſet them.</p>
