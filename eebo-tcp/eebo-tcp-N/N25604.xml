            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Speech of Edward Livingſton.</head>
            <p>MR. LIVINGSTON ſaid he eſteemed it one of the moſt fortunate occurrences of his life, that after an inevitable abſence from his ſeat in that houſe, he had arrived in time to expreſs his diſſent to the paſſage of the bill. It would have been a ſource of eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and the keeneſt remorſe, if any private affairs, however urgent, any domeſtic concerns, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, had deprived him of the opportunity he was then about to uſe, of ſtating his objections, and record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his vote againſt an act which he believed was in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect violation of the conſtitution; and marked with every characteriſtic of the moſt odious deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>On my arrival, ſir, mr. L. ſaid, I enquired what ſubject occupied the attention of the houſe; and being told it was the alien bill, I directed the printed copy to be brought to me, but to my great ſurpriſe ſeven or eight copies of different acts on the ſame ſubject were put in my hands—among them it was difficult (ſo ſtrongly were they marked by the ſame family features), to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the individual bill then under diſcuſſion. This circumſtance give me a ſuſpicion that the principles of the meaſures were erroneous—Truth marches directly to its end by a ſingle undeviating path—Error is either undetermined on its object, or purſues it through a thouſand winding ways—the multiplicity of propoſitions therefore to attain the ſame general but doubtful end, led me to ſuſpect that neither the object nor the means propoſed to attain it were proper or neceſſary. Theſe ſurmiſes were confirmed by a more minute examination of the act—In the conſtruction of ſtatutes, it was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived rule to examine what were the ſtate of things when it was paſſed, and what were the evils it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to remedy—as theſe circumſtances would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034008_0003_0FF9F6D449A9C528"/>in the conſtruction of the law, it might be well to examine them minutely in framing it—the ſtate of things, if we are to judge from the complexion of the bill, muſt be that a number of aliens, enjoying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our government, were plotting its deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—that they are engaged in treaſonable machinations againſt a people who have given them an aſylum and ſupport, and that no proviſion is found to provide for their expulſion and puniſhment. If theſe things are ſo and no remedy exiſts for the evil, one ought ſpeedily to be provided, but even then it muſt be a remedy that is conſiſtent with the conſtitution under which we act—for as by that inſtrument, all powers not expreſſly given by it to the union, are reſerved by the ſtates—it follows that unleſs an expreſs authority can be found, veſting us with the power, be the evil never ſo great it can only be remedied by the ſeveral ſtates who have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver delegated the authority to congreſs—but this point will be preſently examined, and it will not be a difficult taſk to ſhew that the proviſions of this bill are not only unauthoriſed by the conſtitution, but are in direct vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of its fundamental principles, and contradictory to ſome of its moſt expreſs prohibitions; at preſent it is only neceſſary to aſk whether the ſtate of things contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated by the bill have any exiſtence—We muſt legiſlate upon facts, not on ſurmiſes—we muſt have evidence, not vague ſuſpicions, if we mean to legiſlate with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—What facts have been produced? What evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had been ſubmitted to the houſe? I have heard, ſir, of none—but if evidence of facts could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, at leaſt it might have been expected that reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cauſe of ſuſpicion ſhould be ſhewn—here again gentlemen were at fault—they could not ſhew even a <hi>ſuſpicion why theſe aliens ought to be ſuſpected.</hi> We have, indeed, been told that the fate of Venice, Switzerland, and Batavia, was produced by the interference of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners. But, the inſtances were unfortunate—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all thoſe powers had been overcome by foreign force, or divided by domeſtic faction, not by aliens who reſided among them; and if any inſtruction was to be gained from thoſe republics, it would be that we ought to baniſh not the aliens but all thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Nothing of this kind has been yet done. A modern Theſeus, indeed, has told us he has procured a clue<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Harper, declared in the houſe, that he had hold of certain <hi>

Who the fair Ariadne is who kindly gave him the ball he has not revealed: nor though ſeveral days have elapſed ſince he undertook the adventure, has he yet told where the monſter lurks. No evidence then being produced, we have a right to ſay that none exiſts, and yet we are about to ſanction a moſt important act, and on what grounds? our individual ſuſpicions, our private fears, our over-heated imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Seeing nothing to excite thoſe ſuſpicions, and not feeling thoſe fears, I could not give my aſſent to the bill, even if I did not feel a ſuperior obligation to reject it on other grounds. As far as my own obſervation goes, I have ſeen nothing like the ſtate of things contemplated by the bill. Moſt of the aliens I have ſeen were either triumphant Engliſhmen, or Frenchmen, with dejection in their countenances and grief at their hearts, preparing to quit the country and ſeek another aſylum. But if theſe plots exiſt, if this treaſon is apparent, if there are aliens guilty of the crimes that are aſcribed to them, an effectual remedy preſents itſelf for the evil; we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wiſe laws, we have upright judges and vigilant magiſtrates, and there is no neceſſity of arming the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive with the deſtructive power propoſed by the bill now on your table—the laws now in force are competent to puniſh every treaſonable or ſeditions attempt.</p>
            <p>But grant, ſir, what however has not been at all ſupported by fact, grant that theſe fears are not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary, that the dangers are imminent and that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting law is ſufficient to avert them; let us examine whether the proviſions of the bill are conformable to the principles of the conſtitution: if it ſhould be found to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034008_0005_0FF9F762859ED7C0"/>contravene them, I truſt it will loſe many of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſupporters; but if not only contrary to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpirit and principles of the conſtitution, it ſhould alſo be found diametrically oppoſite to its moſt expreſs prohibitions, I cannot doubt that it would be rejected with that indignant deciſion which our duty to our country, and our ſacred oath demands.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſection provides that it ſhall be lawful for the Preſident, "to order all ſuch aliens as he ſhall <hi>judge dangerous</hi> to the peace and ſafety of the United States, or ſhall have <hi>reaſonable ground to ſuſpect</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in any <hi>treaſonable or ſecret machinations</hi> againſt the goverment thereof, to depart out of the United States, in ſuch time as ſhall be expreſſed in ſuch order."</p>
            <p>Our goverment, ſir, is founded on the eſtabliſhment of thoſe principles which conſtitute the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a free conſtitution, and a deſpotic power; a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the legiſlative, executive and judiciary powers, into ſpecial hands, a diſtribution, ſtrongly marked in three firſt and great diviſions of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution—by firſt—all legiſlative power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Congreſs, the ſecond veſts all executive func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the preſident, and the third declares that the judiciary power ſhall be exerciſed by the ſupreme and inferior courts; here then is a diviſion, of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental powers ſtrongly marked, deciſively pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and every act of one or all of the branches that tends to confound theſe powers, or alter this arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be deſtructive of the conſtitution: examine then, ſir, the bill on your table, and declare whether the few lines I have repeated from the firſt ſection do not confound theſe fundamental powers of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, veſt them all in the moſt unqualified terms in one hand, and thus ſubvert the baſis on which our liberties reſt.</p>
            <p>Legiſlative power preſcribes the rule of action; the judiciary applies that general rule to particular caſes, and it is the province of the executive to ſee that the laws are carried into full effect. In all free gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments theſe powers are exerciſed by different men, and their union in the ſame hand is the peculiar character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of deſpotiſm: if the ſame power that makes the law can conſtrue it to ſuit his intereſt and apply it to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034008_0006_0FF9F6E656A01570"/>gratify his vengance, if he can go further, and execute according to his own paſſions, the judgment which he, himſelf, has pronounced upon his own conſtruction, of laws, which he alone has made, what other features are wanted to complete the picture of tyrany; yet all <hi>this and more</hi> is propoſed to be done by this act; by it the preſident alone, is empowered to make the law, to fix in his own mind, what acts, what words what thoughts or looks, ſhall conſtitute the crime contemplated by the bill; that is the crime of being "ſuſpected to be dangerous to the peace and ſafety of the United States." He is not only authorized to make this law, for his, own conduct, but to vary it at pleaſure, as every guſt of paſſion, every cloud of ſuſpicion, ſhall agitate or darken his mind; the ſame power that formed the law then applies it to the guilty or innocent victim whom his own ſuſpicions or the ſecret whiſper of a ſpy have deſignated as its object; the preſident then having made the law, the preſident having conſidered and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it, the ſame preſident is by the bill, authorized to execute his ſentence, in caſe of diſobedience, by impriſonment, <hi>during his pleaſure.</hi> This, then comes completely within the definition of deſpotiſm, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of legiſlative, executive, and judicial powers. But this bill, ſir, does not ſtop here, its proviſions are a refinement upon deſpotiſm and preſent an image of the moſt fearful tyranny—Even in deſpotiſms, though the monarch legiſlates, judges and executes, yet he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlates openly, his laws though oppreſſive, are known, they precede the offence, and every man who chooſes may avoid the penalties of diſobedience. Yet he jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and executes by proxy, and his preſent intereſt or paſſions do not inflame the mind of his deputy.</p>
            <p>But here the law is cloſely concealed in the ſame mind that gives it birth—the crime is "exciting the ſuſpicions of the preſident," but no man can tell what conduct will avoid that ſuſpicion—a careleſs word, perhaps miſrepreſented or never ſpoken, may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence, a look may deſtroy, an idle geſture may inſure puniſhment, no innocence can protect—no circumſpection can avoid the jealouſy of ſuſpicion—ſurrounded by ſpies, informers and all that infamous herd which fatten under laws like this. The unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034008_0007_0FF9CAE81F0E8FC0"/>ſtranger will never know either of the law, of the accuſation or of the judgment until the moment it is put into execution—he will deteſt your tyranny, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> from a land of delators, inquiſitions and ſpies.</p>

            <p>Having ſhewn that this act is at war with the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles of our government, I might ſtop here in the certain hope, of its rejection—But I can do more; unleſs we are reſolved to pervert the meaning of terms, I can ſhew that the conſtitution has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to "make its ſurety doubly ſure, and take a bond of fate!" by ſeveral expreſs prohibitions of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures like that you now contemplate. One of theſe is contained in the 9th ſection of the firſt article, it is at the head of the articles which reſtrict the powers of Congreſs, and declares "that the <hi>migration or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of ſuch perſons, as any of the ſtates, ſhall think proper to omit, ſhall not be prohibited prior to the year 1808" Now, ſir, where is the difference between a power to prevent the arrival of aliens and a power to ſend them away as ſoon as they ſhall arrive? to me they appear preciſely the ſame. The conſtitution ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſays, that congreſs ſhall not do this, and yet congreſs are about to delegate this prohibited power, and ſay, that the preſident may excerciſe it as often as his pleaſure may direct. I am informed that an anſwer has been attempted to this argument, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the article, though it ſpeaks of <hi>"perſons."</hi> only relates to ſlaves? But a concluſive reply to this anſwer may be drawn from the words of the ſection, it ſpeaks of migration and importation; if it related on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſlaves, <hi>"importation,"</hi> would have been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; but how can the other word apply to ſlaves; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration is a voluntary change of a country; but who
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034008_0008_0FF9F7758A404098"/>ever heard of a migration of ſlaves! the truth is, both words have their appropriate meaning, and even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſecure the intereſts of different quarters of the union? The middle ſtates wiſhed to ſecure themſelves againſt any laws that might impede the emigration of ſettlers; the ſouthern ſtates did not like to be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the importation of ſlaves, and ſo jealous were they of this proviſion, that the fifth article was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to declare that the conſtitution ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ſo as to do it away.</p>
            <p>But even admit the abſurdity, that the word, "mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration" has no meaning, or one foreign to its uſual acceptation, and that the article relates only to ſlaves; Even this ſacrifice of common ſenſe will not help gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen out of their dilemma—ſlaves probably always, but certainly on their firſt importation, are <hi>aliens,</hi> many people think they are always "dangerous to the peace and ſafety of the United States!" if the preſident ſhould be of this opinion, he not only can, but by the terms of this law, is obliged to order them off; for the act creates an obligation on him to ſend away all ſuch <hi>aliens</hi> as he ſhall judge dangerous to the peace or ſafety of the United States. Thus, according to the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conſtruction, every proprietor of this ſpecies of property, holds it at the will and pleaſure of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident—and this, too, in defiance of the only article of the conſtitution, that is declared to be <hi>unalterable.</hi>—But let us, ſir, for a moment, if it be poſſible, let us imagine that a conſtitution, founded on a diviſion of powers, into three hands, may be preſerved, although all theſe powers ſhould be ſurrendered into one; let us imagine, if we can, that the ſtates intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict the general government, from preventing the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of perſons whom they were yet willing to ſuffer that ſame general goverment to ſhip off as ſoon as they ſhould arrive: grant all this; and they will be as far from eſtabliſhing the conſtitutionality of the bill, as they were at the firſt moment it was propoſed—for in the 3d article it is provided, that all "judicial power ſhall be veſted in the ſupreme and inferior courts," that the trial of "all crimes ſhall be by jury," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in caſe of impeachment; and in the 7th and 8th amendments, proviſion is repeated and enforced by
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034008_0009_0FF9F7C36DB468B0"/>others this which declare, that "no man ſhall be held to anſwer for a capital or otherwiſe infamous crime, unleſs on a preſentment of a grand jury" that "in all <hi>criminal proſecutions</hi> the accuſed ſhall enjoy the right to a ſpeedy and <hi>public</hi> trial, by an impartial <hi>jury</hi> of the ſtate and diſtrict where the crime ſhall have been committed, which diſtrict ſhall have been previouſly aſcertained by law; and to be <hi>informed</hi> of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>cauſe</hi> of the accuſation, to be <hi>confronted</hi> with the witneſſes againſt him, to have compulſory proceſs for obtaining witneſſes in his favour, and to have the aſſiſtance of council for his defence"—Now, ſir, what minute article in theſe ſeveral proviſions of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is there that is not violated by this bill? all the bulwarks which it oppoſed to encroachments on perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal liberty, fall before this engine of oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judiciary power</hi> is taken from courts, and given to the executive, the previous ſafeguard of a preſentment by a grand inqueſt is removed, the trial by jury is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: the "<hi>public trial</hi> required by the conſtitution is changed into a ſecret and worſe than inquiſitorial tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: inſtead of giving "information of the nature and cauſe of the accuſation," the criminal, alike ignorant of his offence and the danger to which he is expoſed, never hears of either until the judgment is paſſed, and the ſentence is executed: inſtead of being <hi>"confronted with his accuſers,"</hi> he is kept alike ignorant of their names and their exiſtence, and even the forms of a trial being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with, it would be a mockery to talk of "proceſs for witneſſes," or the "aſſiſtance of council for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence," thus are all the barriers which the wiſdom and humanity of our country had placed between accuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and oppreſſive power at once forced and broke down. Not a veſtige even of their form remains. No indictment, no jury, no trial—no public procedure, no ſtatement of the accuſation; no examination of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in its ſupport. No council for defence—all is darkneſs, ſilence, myſtery, and ſuſpicion. But as if this were not enough; the unfortunate victims of this law are told in the next ſection that if they can convince the preſident that his ſuſpicions are unfounded, he may, <hi>if he pleaſes,</hi> give them a licenſe to ſtay—but how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his ſuſpicions when they know not on what act
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034008_0010_0FF9F7848DB7DB28"/>they were founded? how take proof to convince him, when he is not bound to furniſh that on which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; miſerable mockery of juſtice! appoint an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary judge armed with legiſlative and executive powers added to his own! let him condemn the unheard, the unaccuſed object of his ſuſpicion, and then to cover the injuſtice of the ſcene, gravely tell him, you ought not to complain, you need only diſprove facts that you have never heard, remove ſuſpicions that have never been communicated to you, it will be eaſy to convince your judge, whom you ſhall not approach, that he is tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and unjuſt, and when you have done this, we give him the power he had before, to pardon you if he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>So obviouſly do the conſtitutional objections preſent themſelves, that their exiſtence cannot be denied, and two wretched ſubterfuges are reſorted to, to remove them out of ſight. Firſt, it is ſaid, the bill does not contemplate the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of any <hi>crime,</hi> and therefore, the proviſions in the conſtitution, relative to criminal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and judiciary powers do not apply. But have the gentlemen who reaſon thus, read the bill, or is every thing forgotton in our zealous hurry to paſs it? What are the offences upon which it is to operate? Not only the offence of being "ſuſpected to be dangerous to the peace and ſafety of the United States," but alſo that of being "concerned in any <hi>treaſonable</hi> or ſecret machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the <hi>government thereof.</hi>" And this we are told is no <hi>crime!</hi> a <hi>treaſonable</hi> machination againſt the government, is not the ſubject of criminal juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence! good heaven, to what abſurdities does an over zealous attachment to particular meaſures lead us! in order to puniſh a particular act, we are forced to ſay, that treaſon is no crime, and plotting againſt our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no offence. And to ſupport this fine hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, we are obliged to plunge deeper in abſurdity and ſay, that as the acts ſpoken of in the bill, are no crimes; ſo the penalty contained in it is no <hi>puniſhment,</hi> it is only a <hi>prevention;</hi> that is to ſay, we invite ſtrangers to come among us, we declare ſolemnly that government ſhall not have the power to prevent them—we entice them over by deluſive proſpects of advantage, in many parts of the union we permit them to hold lands, and give
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034008_0011_0FF9F7D4DB2372E0"/>them other advantages, while they are waiting for the period at which we have promiſed a full participation of all our rights—an unfortunate ſtranger, diſguſted with tyranny at home, thinks he ſhall find freedom here, he accepts your conditions, he puts faith in your promiſes, he reſts his whole property in your hands, he has diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his former connections and made your country his own. But while he is patiently waiting the expiration of the period that is to crown the work, and entitles him to all the rights of a citizen, the tale of a domeſtic ſpy, or the calumny of a ſecret enemy draws on him the ſuſpicions of the preſident—and, unheard, he is ordered to quit the ſpot which he ſolicited for his retreat, the country he had choſen for his own, perhaps the family which was his only conſolation in life, he is ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to a country whoſe government irritated by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of its authority, will receive only to puniſh him—and all this we are ſeriouſly told is <hi>no puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again we are told, that the conſtitutional compact was made between citizens only; and that therefore, its proviſions were not intended to extend to <hi>aliens,</hi> and that this act operating only on there, is therefore not forbidden by the conſtitution. But unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, neither common law, common juſtice, nor the practice of any civilized nation will permit this diſtinction: It is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged principle of the common law, the authority of which is eſtabliſhed here, that alien friends (and permit me to obſerve that they are ſuch only, whom we contemplate by this bill, for we have another before us, to ſend off alien enemies), reſiding among us, are entitled to the protection of our laws. And that during their reſidence they owe a temporary allegiance to our government. If they are accuſed of violating this allegiance, the ſame laws that interpoſe in the caſe of a citizen, muſt determine the truth of the accuſation, and if found guilty they are liable to the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this rule is conſonant to the principles of common juſtice; for who would ever reſort to another country, if he alone was marked out as the object of arbitrary power? It is equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate too for this argument, that the conſtitution expreſsly excludes any idea of this diſtinction, it ſpeaks of all "judicial power"—"all trials for crimes, all "criminal proſecutions"—all "perſons accuſed." No diſtinction between citizen and alien, between high or low; friends or oppoſers of the executive power, republican and royaliſt. All, all are entitled to the ſame equal diſtribution of juſtice, to the ſame humane proviſions to protect their innocence—all are liable to the ſame puniſhment that awaits their guilt. How comes it too if then the conſtitutional proviſions were intended for the ſafety of the citizen only, that our courts
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034008_0012_0FF9F7922ACF5DA8"/>uniformly extend them to all, and that we never heard it enquired whether the accuſed is a citizen before we give him a public trial by jury.</p>
            <p>So manifeſt do theſe violations of the conſtitution ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me, ſo futile the arguments in their defence, that they preſs ſeriouſly upon my mind and ſink it even to deſpondency—they have been ſo glaring to my underſtanding, that I felt it my duty to ſpeak of them in a manner that may perhaps give offence to men whom I eſteem and who ſeem to think differently on that ſubject—none, however, I can aſſure them is intended.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen meaſures carried in this houſe which I thought militated againſt the ſpirit of the conſtitution, but never before have I been witneſs to ſo open, ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and undiſguiſed an attack. I have now done, ſir, with the act and come to conſider the conſequences of its operation.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt ſerious has been anticipated when I deſcribed the blow it would give to the conſtitution of our country—we ſhould cautiouſly beware of the firſt act of violation; habituated to over leap its bounds, we become familiarized to the guilt and diſregard the danger of a ſecond offence—until proceeding from one unauthorized act to another, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at length throw of all the reſtraints which our conſtitution has impoſed; and very ſoon not even the ſemblance of its forms will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>
            <p>But if regardleſs of our duty as citizens, and our ſolem obligation as repreſentatives, regardleſs of the rights of our conſtituents—of their opinion and that of poſterity—regardleſs of every ſanction, human and divine—if <hi>we</hi> are ready to violate the conſtitution we have ſworn to defend—will the PEOPLE SUBMIT to our unauthorized acts? will the ſtates ſanction our uſurped power? Sir, they ought not to ſubmit—they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the chains which theſe meaſures are forging for them, if they did not reſiſt. For let no man vainly imagine that the evil is to ſtop here, that a few unprotected ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens only are to be affected by this inquiſitorial power; the ſame arguments which enforce thoſe proviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt aliens, apply with equal ſtrength to enacting them in the caſe of citizens: the citizen has no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection for his perſonal ſecurity that I know, againſt laws like this, than the humane proviſions I have cited
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034008_0013_0FF9F7E417CB4B18"/>from the conſtitution: but all theſe apply in common to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen and the ſtranger: <hi>"All crimes"</hi> are to be tried by jury—"No <hi>perſon</hi>" ſhall be held to anſwer unleſs on preſentment: in all <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal proſecutions</hi> the <hi>"accuſed"</hi> is to have a public trial: the "ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed" is to be informed of the nature of the charge: to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with the witneſſes againſt him. May have proceſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the appearance of thoſe in his favour, and is to be allowed council for his defence—Unleſs, therefore, we can believe that <hi>treaſonable machinations</hi> and the other offences deſcribed in the bill are not <hi>crimes</hi>—that an alien is not a <hi>perſon</hi>—and that one charged with treaſonable practices is not <hi>"accuſed"</hi>—unleſs we can believe all this, in contradiction to our own underſtandings, to received opinions and the uniform practice of our courts, we muſt allow that all theſe proviſions extend equally to aliens and natives, and that the citizen has no other ſecurity for his perſonal ſafety than is extended to the ſtranger, who is within his gates; if, therefore, this ſecurity is violated in one inſtance, what pledge have we that it will not in the other? The ſame plea of neceſſity will juſtify both: either the offences deſcribed in the act are crimes, or they are not; if they are, then all the humane proviſions of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution forbid the mode of puniſhing or preventing them equally as relates to aliens and citizens. If they are not crimes, then the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen has no more ſafety by the conſtitution than the alien has; for all thoſe proviſions apply only to <hi>crimes.</hi> So that in either event, the citizen has the ſame reaſon to expect a ſimilar law to the one now before you; which ſubjects his perſon to the uncontrolled deſpotiſm of a ſingle man. You have already been told of plots, conſpiracies—and all the frightful images that were neceſſary to keep up the preſent ſyſtem of terror and alarm were preſented to you: but who were implicated by theſe dark hints—theſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious alluſions?—they were our own citizens, ſir, not aliens: if there is then any neceſſity for the ſyſtem now propoſed, it is more neceſſary to be enforced againſt our own citizens, than againſt ſtrangers; and I have no doubt that either in this, or ſome other ſhape they will be attempted. I now aſk, ſir, whether the people of America are prepared for this? Whether they are willing to part with all the means which the wiſdom of their anceſtors diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and their own caution ſo lately adopted to ſecure the liberty of their perſons? Whether they are ready to ſubmit to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, or exile, whenever ſuſpicion, calumny or vengeance, ſhall mark them for ruin? Are they baſe enough to be prepared for this? No, ſir, they will, I repeat it, they will reſiſt this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannic ſyſtem; the people will oppoſe, the ſtates will not ſubmit to its operation: they ought not to acquieſce, and I pray to God they never may. My opinions, ſir, on this ſubject are explicit, and I wiſh they may be known; they are, that whenever our laws ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly infringe the conſtitution under which they were made, the people ought not to heſitate which they ſhould obey: if we exceed our powers, we become tyrants, and our acts have no effect.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034008_0014_0FF9F7A33498D418"/>Thus, ſir, one of the firſt effects of meaſures ſuch as this, if they ſhould not be acquieſced in, will be diſaffection among the ſtates, and oppoſition among the people to your government; tumults, violence, and a recurrence to firſt revolutionary principles. If they are ſubmitted to, the conſequences will be worſe—After ſuch manifeſt violation of the principles of our conſtitution, the form will not long be ſacred; preſently every veſtige of it will be loſt and ſwallowed up in the gulph of deſpotiſm—but ſhould the evil proceed no further than the execution of the preſent law, what a fearful picture will our country preſent—the ſyſtem of <hi>eſpionage</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> eſtabliſhed; the country will ſwarm with informers, ſpies, delators, and all that odious reptile tribe that breed in the ſunſhine of deſpotic power, that ſuck the blood of the unfortunate, and creep into the boſom of ſleeping innocence only to wake it with a burning wound—the hours of the moſt unſuſpecting confidence; the intimacies of friendſhip, or the receſſes of domeſtic retirement, afford no ſecurity: the companion whom you moſt truſt, the friend in whom you confide, the domeſtic who waits in your chamber, are all tempted to betray your imprudence or guardleſs follies; to miſrepreſent your words; to convey them, diſtorted by calumny, to the ſecret tribunal where jealouſy preſides; where fear officiates as accuſer, and ſuſpicion is the only evidence that is heard.</p>
            <p>Theſe, bad as they are, are not the only ill conſequences of theſe meaſures: among them we may reckon the loſs of wealth, of population, and of commerce. Gentlemen who ſupport the bill, ſeemed to be aware of this, when yeſterday they introduced a clauſe to ſecure the property of thoſe who might be ordered to go off; they ſhould have foreſeen the conſequences of the ſteps they have been taking; it is now too late to diſcover that large ſums are drawing from the banks, that a great capital is taken from commerce. It is ridiculous even to obſerve the ſolicitude they ſhew to retain the wealth of theſe dangerous men, whoſe perſons they are ſo eager to get rid of; if they wiſh to retain it, it muſt be by giving them ſecurity to their perſons, and aſſuring them that while they reſpect the laws, the laws will protect them from arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power; it muſt be, in ſhort, by rejecting the bill on your table. I might mention many other inferior conſiderations: but I ought, ſir, rather to intreat the pardon of the houſe, for having touched on this; compared to the breach of our conſtitution, and the eſtabliſhment of arbitrary power, every other topic is trifling; arguments of convenience ſink into nothing; the preſervation of wealth, the intereſts of commerce, however weighty on other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, here loſe their importance: When the fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of freedom are in danger, we are tempted to borrow the impreſſive language of a foreign ſpeaker, and exclaim—"Periſh our commerce, let our conſtitution live:"—Periſh our riches, let our freedom live—this, ſir, would be the ſentiment of every Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, were the alternative between ſubmiſſion and wealth; but here, ſir, it is propoſed to deſtroy our wealth, in order to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034008_0015_0FF9F7F210A4A690"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>I have now done ſir, but before I ſit down let me intreat gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſeriouſly reflect before they pronounce the deciſive vote, that gives the firſt open ſtab to the principles of our government. Our miſtaken zeal, like that of the patriarch of old, has bound the victim; it lies at the foot of the altar; a ſacrifice of the firſt born offspring of freedom is propoſed by thoſe who gave it birth. The hand is already raiſed to ſtrike, and nothing I fear but the voice of Heaven can arreſt the impious blow.</p>
            <p>Let not gentlemen flatter themſelves that the fervour of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can make the people inſenſible to theſe aggreſſions. It is an honeſt noble warmth, produced by an indignant ſenſe of injury. It will never, I truſt, be extinct, while there is a proper cauſe to excite it: but the people of America, ſir, though watchful againſt foreign aggreſſion are not careleſs of domeſtic encroachment; they are as jealous, ſir, of their liberties at home, as of the power and proſperity of their country abroad: they will awake to a ſenſe of their danger; do not let us flatter ourſelves then that theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures will be unobſerved or diſregarded. Do not let us be told, ſir, that we excite a fervour againſt foreign aggreſſion, only to eſtabliſh tyranny at home; that, like the arch traitor, we cry <hi>"Hail, Columbia,"</hi> at the moment we are betraying her to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that we ſing out <hi>"happy land,"</hi> when we are plunging it in ruin or diſgrace: and that we are abſurd enough to call our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>"free and enlightened,"</hi> while we advocate principles that would have diſgraced the age of Gothic barbarity, and eſtabliſh a code compared to which the ordeal is wiſe, and the trial by battle is merciful and juſt.</p>
