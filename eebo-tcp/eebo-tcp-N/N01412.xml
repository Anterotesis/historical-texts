            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT is not ſingularity or Oſtentation that I appear in Print, but my Chriſtian Duty, in Honour to God, and the Salvation and well being of the ſouls of men, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Anti-chriſtian Practice in <hi>making Slaves</hi> of them who bear the Image of God, <hi>viz.</hi> their fellow, Creature, Man; A Practice ſo <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>inhumane,</hi> that the more it is thought upon by judicious men, the more they do abhor it; It being ſo vile a contradiction to the Goſpel of the bleſſed Meſſiah.</p>
                  <p>And if our Negro-Maſters were put to it, to bring an Inſtance that a man denyed the Chriſtian Faith, I think they could not bring a ſtronger Inſtance, then that he was found in the Practice of making Slaves of men. And furthermore, I doubt not, but this may be to ſome a very unwelcome Theam, and they would wonder to find their beloved <hi>Deti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the Truth on my ſide. And if theſe Lines ſhould come to the <hi>Iſland of Great Britain</hi> (my native I and) I hope the ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians there of all Sects will commend my Chriſtian care, in detecting ſo groſs a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as this, crept in by reaſon of the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e and Gains it brings to our <hi>American Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> And I hope the <hi>learned Chriſtians</hi> there will admoniſh their <hi>American Brethren,</hi> for putting ſuch an Affront upon the ever bleſſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and his glorious Goſpel as this their Practice doth, in making Slaves of Men.</p>
                  <p>This Practice cannot but be very offenſive to ſincere and honeſt hearted Chriſtians, that this Practie ſhould be heard among the Heathen, to harden them in ſuch <hi>heatheniſh Practices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Reader,</hi> I am going to ſhew thee a Wonder, and that is, this thirty years that <hi>I</hi> have been in <hi>America,</hi> this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice has been carried on almoſt in profound ſilence, which it is like the Negro-Maſters will take it the harder to be oppoſed now.

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> then, God hath given to man a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Will, ſo that he is Maſter of his own Choice (whether it be good or evil) and will in no way force and compel the Will of man; yea, not unto that part which is good, far leſs unto evil, notwithſtanding his Attribute of Omnipotence. And ſeeing then, it is thus with God and his Creatures, we ought alſo to do ſo by our fellow mortals, and therefore we ought not to force and compel our fellow creatures, the Negroes, Nay, not although we judge it for them a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of living; For when we force their will, this is a manifeſt Robbery of that noble Gift their bountiful Creator hath given them, and is a right down Contradiction to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Attributes of God, and conſequently an Anti-Chriſtian Practice And ſo, thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God and his Attributes, they may expect

to incur his Diſpleaſure; So they may find a pregnant Inſtance in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Egyptian Task-Maſters.</p>
                     <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> This Practice contradicts Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, who commanded us, <hi>To do to all men as we would they ſhould do to us,</hi> or as we would be done by. Now the buying and ſelling of the <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, was and is the Merchandize of the Babyloniſh Merchants ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> Now the Tyranizing over and making Slaves of our Fellow Creatures, the Negroes, every one knows, or may know, this is not the way they would be done unto.</p>
                     <p>Now, I have ſhown you, <hi>firſt,</hi> That this Practice oppoſes God and his Attributes, and 2<hi>dly,</hi> That it oppoſes Chriſt and his Command; And what is this in Effect but to bid Defyance, and to live in Oppoſition to Chriſt and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? and if ſo, it is a high Degree of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Life and Practice.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And now I think I have proved by Scripture, that keeping of Slaves was practiſed of Old; And now I intend to ſhew that it is according to the <hi>Chriſtianity of our Times, Firſt</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

and agrement of all the ſeveral Sects of Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>I begin then with the famous <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (who are not ignorant of our Negro-<hi>P</hi>ractice) who by their Chriſtian care do ſend their <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> hither to <hi>America,</hi> to teach the Inhabitants here the Principles and Practices of Chriſtianity; And it is evident thoſe Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries do make their Gains by Negro Slaves, and have their Houſes crawling <hi>black</hi> with them, by which they ſet an Example to others to follow their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eps; And not a word of Sin in all this. And I never heard that a Biſhop ever wrote a word againſt it; by which I think it is evident that the making Slaves of Negroes is according to <hi>Church-Chriſtianity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> I can ſhew by that famous and zealous Sect of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent followers of the Principles and Practices of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> witneſs the Rejecting the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I can ſhew by that pious Sect of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> Witneſs ſome of them their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in Apparel, and their Dexterity in the Point of Water-Baptiſm, in telling the reſt of Chriſtians in Print, that they do cheat the World in the Point of Infant Baptiſm; but they very

Lovingly embrace this Practice in making Slaves of Negroes.</p>
                     <p>Now if the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts</hi> did but agree ſo lovingly in other Points as they do in making Slaves of Negroes, I think they might be ſtiled <hi>One Community.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, if thoſe ſeveral Sects of Chriſtians and their unanimous Agreement in this Practice of making <hi>Slaves of Negroes,</hi> as I have already ſhewed, does not amount to a Proof, I know not what will,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chriſtians Anſwer,</hi> I do confeſs this is a Proof, that ſome of all thoſe ſeveral Sects do Practiſe this Point of Impiety, which I would readily have confeſſed without a word of Proof, except what mine Eyes have ſeen; For all theſe Sects of People both by Principle and Practice do <hi>Fight,</hi> and <hi>Kill,</hi> and take away the Lives of many Thouſands in Battles, for their inriching of themſelves, and for their own Advantages, and therefore it is no Wonder that all thoſe Sects agree ſo well in making Slaves of Negros, or others whom they can get the Maſtery over (for their own Advantage.)</p>
                     <p>But as this is very forreign from <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and out of the Peaceable Goſpel of the bleſſed Meſſiah (for <hi>worrying, Tearing</hi> and <hi>Killing</hi> are the marks of <hi>Dogs, Wolves</hi> and <hi>Bears,</hi> which is the Practice of thoſe aforeſaid Sects of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as they call themſelves: but the Innocence of Lambs and Doves was and is the Characteriſtick of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) ſo I think this is ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet what was alledged for a Proof by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

                     <p>But I have a further Anſwer for you, and that is, I utterly deny that either <hi>Church-men</hi> or <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> have generally agreed in making Slaves of Negros; For ſome of both have preached and ſome have printed againſt it here in <hi>North America;</hi> And ſome that have had Negroes their Conſcience would not allow them to keep them for Slaves, but after ſome Time of Service they ſet them free.</p>
                     <p>Hence I infer, That making Slaves of men is an evil ſo abominable in the nature of it that men whoſe Principles are ſo large as to allow of <hi>Killing men,</hi> cannot allow of making Men <hi>Slaves,</hi> accounting it worſe to <hi>Rob</hi> men o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And hence I infer, that none would believe it lawfull, if they were not either blinded with the love of Gain, or with the plauſible Pretences o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And yet I cannot ſee how they can be a Proof in this, above all other Chriſtians, eſpecially when it is thought by ſome of the <hi>honeſt hearted</hi> among them, that about the <hi>eleventh</hi> Year of the eighteenth Century the moſt of them Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed their primitive <hi>I</hi>nnocence, when they ſo lovingly agreed and joyned with the other Sects to pay the Souldiers their proportion of Wages to go in the Expedition againſt their Neighbours of <hi>Canada;</hi> And when they looſe their <hi>lnnocence,</hi> I know not what they keep that is <hi>lovely</hi> among them.</p>

here among the <hi>Quakers?</hi> and yet they are both Merchants and Maſters of Negroes. But I think to argue this Point a little more cloſely; For before the eleventh year of the eighteenth Century (which is the year thou mentionedſt) that they could not be a proof in this Point, more then other Chriſtians, becauſe they joyned with other Sects (in the Wars againſt <hi>Canada</hi>) they had Negro Slaves. But I will bring you to another Inſtance, viz. All the Time preceeding that fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Year, particularly <hi>One thouſand ſix hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two,</hi> when <hi>Andrew Hamilton</hi> was Governour of the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> Did not all the <hi>Quakers</hi> refuſe to pay the Souldiers to fight againſt the French at <hi>Albany?</hi> for the which Refual, great Havock was made of their Goods by Conſtables. Were not all the <hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>Amboy</hi> ſtrained, excepting one man that paid to maintain the Wars at <hi>Albany?</hi> And thou ſayeſt, it was no wonder that this man afterward became a Negro-Maſter; For he was the firſt of that People that ever I heard of, that ſacrificed that Innocent Principle (as thou calleſt it) and did pay the Rate that was raiſed to maintain the <hi>Albany</hi> War. Were they not all ſtrained in <hi>Freehold?</hi> And did they not ſuffer in <hi>Shrewsbury?</hi> was their not a Barrel of Pork rolled out of one of their Cellers in <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> becauſe they refuſed in any ſenſe to have a hand in the Wars of <hi>Albany?</hi> And yet, all this Time of their <hi>I</hi>nnocence, they did not forget their Intereſt, but did become Negro-Maſters.</p>
                     <p>I know Practice and Example will go a great way in <hi>Education,</hi> and why ſhould it not go as

                     </p>
                     <p>Now, if what I have ſaid do not amount to perfect Proof that we may make Slaves of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gros, or any other that we can get the Maſtery over, <hi>I</hi> think the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> forever may be ſilent to bring in the Example and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Eaſt and Weſt-Orthodox, to be a Proof in that Point of the <hi>Real Preſence.</hi>

Head (which I think will utterly overturn all that you have ſaid upon it) The <hi>Quakers</hi> had before that Time, embraced <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> which cannot be upheld without the <hi>Carnal Sword,</hi> whereby they being apoſtatized from their primitive Innocency and Purity, and become, in that like the reſt of the World, it is no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee them in a Practice ſo ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For it was the making Slaves of Negroes, to inrich themſelves, and the embracing of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, <hi>which could not be excecuted without the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sword,</hi> which were the two pincipla Baits that Catched many of that once moſt Worthy People.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There is one thing more, and then I think to take my leave at preſent, of our Negro-Maſters, and that is, I earneſtly invite them to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001678_0027_0FB97FE4E2CF1A30"/>
                        <hi>Repentance;</hi> But how to attain to their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is the Queſtion, for ſuch a heinous ſin; for they will find it to be a ſin of the <hi>Second Table,</hi> that is, in plainer words a ſin <hi>againſt God</hi> and <hi>Man both;</hi> And <hi>I</hi> am of Opinion, that ſuch Sins cannot be repented of without <hi>Reſtitution</hi> made to them that they have wronged; for until the <hi>Cauſe he removed,</hi> I know not how the <hi>Effect ſhould</hi> ceaſe. But they that live and dye without making Reſtitution to them that they have wronged, how they can expect the Forgiveneſs of God, <hi>I</hi> leave this to the Reader to judge, and then they cannot blame the Writer for a falſe Conſtruction. But if it ſhould happen that a Reader ſhould conſtrue, that if the Negro-Maſters do not make Reſtitution to the Negroes for the wrong that they have done them, the Forgiveneſs of God cannot well be obtained, and then leave it to the Negro-Maſters to judge of the Conſequence.</p>
                     <p>The next thing that comes into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, What and if our Negro-Maſters ſhould live and dye without making any Reſtitution at all, to their miſerable Slaves whom they have ſo unjuſtly wronged? The Queſtion then will be, <hi>Whether they may expect ever any Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution at all? I Anſwer</hi> This Queſtion in the Affirmitive, That they may certainly expect it.</p>
                     <p>But for the further underſtanding of this Anſwer, I ſuppoſe then that God hath allotted unto all Mankind an <hi>I</hi>nheritance of Eternal Life, and has written their Names in the Book of Life, and this appears by the frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001678_0028_0FB97FE6513355E8"/>
of it in Scripture, of the blotting their Names out of the Book of Life, which could not be, except their Names were firſt written therein; and ſo all Men may expect to enjoy their Fathers Gift, the Inheritance of Eternal Life, except they forfeit the ſame in ſinning againſt God, or ſinning againſt God and Man, and then their Names are blotted out, as God ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> Him that ſinneth againſt me, him will I blot out.</p>
                     <p>And now I come to the Reſtitution again, and ſay, It cannot ſtand with the Juſtice of God that the Negroes or the wronged ſhall have no Reſtitution at all; and ſeeing then that they muſt be reſtored of the Wrongs that they have ſuffered, it muſt be reſtored out of the Property of him that hath wronged them; and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is his <hi>I</hi>ntereſt of Eternal Life; and ſuch a proportion of this as will be equivolent to the Wrongs done unto the Negroes or any others, muſt go to make up this Reſtitution; for they will have it.</p>
                     <p>For they will have it made up out of your <hi>Portion in Glory,</hi> if you have any left for your ſelves; and if you have not, you may expect ſo much the more <hi>Torment;</hi> and if the Negros or Wronged have no Portion left in Glory to be <hi>increaſed</hi> by it, they may expect to have ſo much the <hi>leſs</hi> Torment;</p>
                     <p>For God will <hi>right all Wrongs,</hi> and do Juſtice between all his Creatures; and what is not in our Power, God doth not require, but he will not forgive what we have in our Power to amend,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001678_0029_0FB97FE85DB2C0B0"/>
and will not do it, ſo Reaſon ſays. And this is the Period of that Branch, the Doing Wrong to Man; But the other Branch, <hi>viz.</hi> The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God, our Negro-Maſters cannot make Reſtitution to God for the Sin committed againſt him, and therefore muſt Suffer the Puniſhment due for ſuch a Sin; and I know no way for our Negro Maſters to eſcape any thing of this, ſo long as the Attributes of God are <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> Except they <hi>Repent</hi> and make <hi>Reſtitution.</hi>
                     </p>

                        </gap> is the buſineſs that is here to be taken notice of and examined. Therefore either the Decrees of God are authentick, or they are not authentick, chooſe which you pleaſe. To ſay the laſt; <hi>viz.

elect, for theſe who were Decreed to Salvation could never be loſt, as I have already ſaid. So then the true conſequence of your doctrine of Predeſtination, is, that Chriſt dyed in vain, yea that he dyed not at, all for the elect; for the elect were ſecure enough without his dying for them; for ſo long as God is God, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is ſure and their ſalvation certain without the death of Chriſt. So then if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> made ſuch a Decree as you ſay he did, in vain was the Law and the Prophets, in vain was all that Chriſt did, and all the labours of his Apoſtles and all good men were to no purpoſe. In vain is all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; In vain is all your preaching, praying, ſinging and reading, and what elſe you practiſe. All is but loſt labour. For the Decrees of God cannot be broken nor altered. Now then, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your doctrine of Predeſtination the caſe ſtands thus with every individual man and Woman, If one be decreed for perdition, let him live Never ſo holy and righteous a life hell and damnation is their portion, for the Decree cannot be broken.</p>
                     <p>Again, if one predeſtinate to life, ſhould live, Never ſo wickedly, heaven and happineſs is their portion, for the Decree cannot be altered. Is not this ric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>riſes naturally from your doctrine of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as you hold it.</p>
                     <p>Is it not ſtrange then that theſe abſurdityes
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001678_0057_0FB9802550ACF390"/>
and their inconſiſtence with God ſcripture and reaſon are not ſeen into and redreſſed. Again is it not a great diſhonour to God to have the ſtability of his decrees queſtioned, as though he could not decree the elects ſalvation without the death of his Son? Is not this to queſtion his omnipotency, and run him to that pinch, either to break his Decree, or then to deliver up his well beloved Son to ſuch an ignonunious death as he under-went.</p>
                     <p>What! my <hi>dear Friends,</hi> muſt God ſend forth his only Son, in whom he is well pleaſed, to ranſom from Hell, Death and Deſtruction, thoſe whom he had elected from all Eternity, for that ſingle Slip in <hi>Adam,</hi> which they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of? otherwiſe his decrees were vain, falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inſignificant, notwithſtanding they were made by an Omnipotent Power from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Oh! is it not a wonder that men are not aſhamed of ſuch abſurd Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Again, is it not a great diſhonour done to JESUS Chriſt to ſay, that be died for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe that ſtood in no need of him to die for them, who were ſo ſure of Salvation as the Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Election and Decree of an omnipotent Power could make them, ſuch wanted no Saviour to die for them, for ſuch never were, are, nor can be loſt.</p>
                     <p>And now, <hi>my Friends,</hi> if you think that you are that elect, or a part of that elect, it is by what is here made moſt plain and ſufficiently evident, that you can lay no claim to Chriſt, nor reap any benefit by his meritorious Death
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001678_0058_0FB98026D2487B20"/>
and Sufferings, nor expect Salvation from him; for you are ſure enough without him; for as ſure as there is a God in Heaven, as ſure are they of Salvation whom he elects and decrees to Life from all Eternity, without the death of his Son. And therefore it is in vain for you to expect Salvation from Chriſt, in ſo doing you do but deceive your ſelves. You may look after God and his eternal Decree for that, and not from Chriſt; for if it be true, that you are in the number of that early Elect, you are ſufficiently ſecure, blow the Storm which way it will; you need not be beholden to Chriſt, you do but thereby provoke God to ſay to you, as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>O ye of little faith, why do ye doubt?</hi> And therefore you may make up your account with your early Decrees, and not with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>For Chriſt was not concerned with you, for ye were never Loſt. For the Work that Chriſt had to do, was to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt, and not that which was not, nor could not be loſt.

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001678_0060_0FB9802BEE57D0B8"/>
ſufficiently evident from theſe few Words in anſwer to this one particular, <hi>viz. That Chriſt died for none but whom you call the Elect, and that none were nor are redeemed by him but only them.</hi> Oh! here is but little Love and Charity either to God or Man.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, for you to think or ſay, That Chriſt died for thoſe elect of whom you ſpeak, is a grand errour, and a great miſtake in you; I doubt ye have only dreamed ſo, and are not yet wakened out of ſleep. The ſign or ſignal is given, you may take the Alarum as you ſee cauſe, but if you be in the number of that early Elect, of which you talk, then are you ſufficiently ſafe and ſecure, nothing can alarm you; but if you are not, then are you warned, ſo that God is clear of your blood, and ſo am I, as will yet further appear from what follows.</p>
                     <p>Neither have you any real foundation for this your aſſertion in holy Scripture, and I do not believe that you ſhall find ſuch an expreſſion from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the end of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> as that, to wit, <hi>That Chriſt died for none but the Elect.</hi> It may be you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps find it in ſome old corrupt Catechiſm or Confeſſion of Faith, but not in the Bible, for the whole currant of Scripture is againſt you therein.</p>
                     <p>For any that God did from Eternity elect to Life, wanted not Chriſt to die for them, they were ſuch as could never wander nor go aſtray, being the firſt born of Eternity, that never

So that neither your Elect nor you, (if you reckon your ſelves of that number) could never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor go aſtray, ſo long as God is GOD, as I have already ſufficiently proved. And ſo, for ſhame, never more hereafter doubt nor queſtion God or his Decrees, left ye be turned one amongſt the Unbelievers to ſeek ſanctuary elſe-where, for your ingratitude and Mis-belief.</p>
                     <p>So that ye may plainly ſee and underſtand, that it was another Elect then you, one of a lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter date then from all Eternity, That Chriſt was concerned with, to ſeek and to ſave, to gather, build and inſtruct in all things neceſſary to their ſalvation in order to eternal Life.</p>

every man, and God wills the ſalvation of all men; Theſe two put together, makes Salvation poſſible to all Mankind, and puts every one in a capacity of Life, ſo that not ſo much as one need to be loſt, of all mankind; for every one that will, is wellcome to eat of the Bread of Life, and drink of the Water of Life freely.</p>
                     <p>And Chriſt himſelf hath promiſed, That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes to him, he will in no wayes caſt out and his call by his ſpirit is univerſal; deny it if you dare.</p>

Wherefore you may reſt your ſelves contented, and I will go and try to find out the true Elect, an Elect of a later date then from all eternity, even Gods Elect for whom Chriſt came, and with whom Chriſt was concerned</p>

whom he came to ſeek and to ſave, whom he did and doth and ſhall at laſt gather from the four Winds of Heaven into his everlaſting Kingdom. It is not thoſe who never went aſtray, nor wandered from their Fathers Houſe.

                     <p>And now, <hi>my dear Freinds,</hi> My advice to you all is, that you renounce that evil Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all the abſurdities thereof, and all other Abſurdities that you hold, and all harſh thoughts of God, and come over to the pure Chriſtianity, and liſt your ſelves Souldiers under Chriſts Banner, where you ſhall find Protection and a Kingdom which ſhall never have an end. This briefly is the true and only Means for you; This is the right Way to go in, and certain Means for all Chriſtians to uſe. This is the Means which God hath fore-ordained or appointed for all that would be Heirs with Chriſt and fellow Citizens of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee what Means God appointed or fore-ordained for the Elect, with whom Chriſt was concerned: which Means is altogether uſeleſs, unneceſſary and ſuperfluous to ſuch as were elected from all eternity. And it is my earneſt deſire unto the Lord, on your behalf, that your Eyes may be opened to ſee the things that concern the everlaſting Peace and Welfare of your Immortal Souls. And as you come to apply your Minds to that divine Light, Spirit,

For what man is there in the whole Univerſe that can or will cruelly and bloodily murder his own young innocent Child, he knowing it certainly to be his own? ſuch a man then ſo cruel would be a monſter, and not a man; nor do I think that the very worſt of men would willingly and wittingly be guilty in matter of fact.</p>
                     <p>Again, contrary ways, what man is there among the Sons of Men, that will be ſo unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural as not to give, his own Children a portion of his goods, according to his ability? year it is natural for the Parents to provide for their Children, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14.

                     <p>Again, I ſay, to do no evil is to do good; and think no evil, is an Act that is good. So here is matter of fact, which is their own proper Act and deed worthy of reward. Again, they are innocent and righteous, holy and harmleſs, and meek and lowly in ſpirit, all which make up the wedding Garment, with which they are cloathed, and their Lamps trimed, and being ſo ready ſhall enter in with the Bridegroom into everlaſting Bliſs.</p>

                     <p>IN the holy Scriptures, the Doctrine of the Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, there is many promiſes of Salvation without the leaſt mentioning of one word of water Baptiſm, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28 to v. 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. and 33. not one word of Water-Baptiſm. <hi>Iſa</hi> 55. 7. <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 8. compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 10 12. with hundreds of places to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and yet he directs the Woman how ſhe might attain Salvation; he neither bids her go to the Prieſts, nor yet to his Diſciples, nor yet to <hi>John</hi> to be baptized with water, but in plain words tells her how ſhe may be ſaved. The Woman taken in Adultery, whom Chriſt did abſolve, he gave her no command to be baptized with Water, but like a harmleſs Lamb, in a few words, ſhows her the only true way to Salvation, <hi>Go and ſin no more.</hi> And it is very obſervable, that of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude whom he cured, he never directed one of them to be baptized with Water, as well knowing how inſignificant that ſign or ceremony was to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and therefore himſelf baptized none with water, nor yet ſo much as once makes mention of it in all his long and unwearied Preachings. Again, the man that was blind from his Birth, <hi>John</hi> 9. whom Chriſt cured, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e neither commanded, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled nor adviſed him to water-baptiſm, who for his noble and valiant teſtimony to Chriſt was by the proud Prieſts and learned Rabbies of the <hi>Jews</hi> caſt out of their Society. In this diſtreſs Chriſt finds him out, and takes him into his, upon his acknowledgment of his Belief, <hi>vers</hi> 38. By which it plainly appears, that Salvation is annexed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, to all that are under the Goſpel Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. And it will be yet more clear and plain if theſe Paſſages of Scripture be duly conſidered, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. The firſt thing that Chriſt preached was, <hi>Repent and believe the Goſpel.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 5. 24. and 6 29. <hi>This is the work of God, that ye do believe.</hi> Mark 9. 23. <hi>All things are poſſible to him that believes.</hi> Then is Salvation poſſible without outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.

                     <p>Now, every one of theſe Citations (with many more beſides) have a faithful Promiſe of Salvation annexed to every one of them, by him that could not lye, without the leaſt regard had to Water-Baptiſm; nor have they relation to Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, neither have theſe Promiſes any dependance upon it; which evidently appears from <hi>Peter'</hi>s own confeſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 34,44. Theſe having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the true Baptiſm, there was no more need of any ſign or ceremony of Water, ſince they had received the ſubſtance; for as the Day breaks the Shadows fly away; neither had <hi>Peter</hi> any command in all his Commiſſion ſo to do, nor to uſe any <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites or Ceremonies among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the truth of this will yet further appear from the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the whole Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who was the great Apoſtle of the <hi>gentiles,</hi> declares in plain words, That he had no Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to baptize with Water.</p>
                     <p>But now look back to <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. from whence, they ſay, they have their Commiſſion for Water-Baptiſm; but I deny there is any Command in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. for water Baptiſm, nor yet in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. nor any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made there of Water-Baptiſm; for their Salvation and Damnation is annexed to Believing or Dis-believing the Goſpel, without any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on Baptiſm, unleſs it be the true one that purges away all ſin, but Water-Baptiſm cannot purge away one ſin, ſo inſignificant is it to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore down falls to nothing that new

Aſſertion, <hi>viz. No promiſe of Salvation without Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19 16. there came one to Chriſt, and ſaid, <hi>Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do, that I may have eternal Life?</hi> Chriſt ſaid unto him, <hi>If thou wouldſt enter into Life, keep the Commands, and ſell that thou haſt, and give to the Poor, and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in heaven, and come and follow Me.</hi> Here is a moſt ſure and certain Promiſe of Salvation without Water-Baptiſm, back't with two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes more, to wit, both <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke, Mark</hi> 10. 21. beſides his former Inſtructions, Chriſt bids him take up his Croſs and follow him. The ſame Inſtructions are recorded in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 18. And this three-fold Cord is not eaſily broke, and a four-fold Cord is yet more ſtronger; for there is both Chriſt and the three Evangeliſts that are one entire Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, That by keeping Gods Commands, by diſpoſſeſſing our hearts and affections of the world by true belief, and taking up the Croſs (for No Croſs, No Crown) and following the Example of our bleſſed Saviour, to all which is annexed moſt ſure and certain Promiſes of Salvation, without Water-Baptiſm; for if it had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o needful to Salvation as this new coyned Argument would have us to underſtand, Chriſt would never have omitted the propagation of it, all the while he taught on earth. I ſay, this new coyned Argument or Aſſertion (or rather a dream of ſome dark Imagination to maintain ſelf-Intereſt) is ſo ſmooth and cunningly deviſed, that in the ears of ignorant People it paſſes for good Coyn unqueſtioned, and makes the ſimple believe they
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001678_0089_0FB98062CAA6B710"/>
have gotten that which indeed they have not got, which is very detrimental to the advancement of Chriſts Kingdom here upon earth.</p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>my dear Friends and Brethren,</hi> If intereſt were ſet aſide, and the true Baptiſm preached and propagated through the world, I mean the baptiſm of the holy Ghoſt, that puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and cleanes the heart, and burns all ſin, and makes the old Fabrick a new Creation, a fit Temple for God to dwell in, this is the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Baptiſm, which hath the certain Promiſe of Salvation to all that receive it, and abides in the operation of it, without the Sign or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Water Baptiſm. And how beneficial would this be to both the learned and unlearned. O! how it would advance the Intereſt and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt upon earth. And ſo all the Lovers of God and ſeekers of his Glory, the good of their Neighbour, and the eternal well-being of their Immortal Souls, would become Preachers of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, either in words or actions, and ſome in both, till the earth were full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Seas, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 9. The Air would become temperate, the bluſtering Winds moderate, the mighty Raging and Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Seas calmed, and the extreams of Heat and Cold abated, and the Earth be like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and all Creatures would rejoyce in the goodneſs of the Lord; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. and chap, 65. 16. to the end; and ſo no more great Sums of Money paid for preaching, for all would be taught of God. And great will be the Peace of that day.

To further on this bleſſed ſtate is to help the Lord againſt the mighty, not with carnal but ſpiritual weapons, for the wrath of man works not the righteouſneſs of God. But to turn to a concluſion from this digreſſion, I ſay, to conclude this Brief conſideration, I think, I may ſafely ſay of Water baptiſm, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. ſaith he, neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion nor uncircumciſion avails any thing, but keeping Gods commands; ſo it is neither the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, nor the wanting of Water baptiſm that makes a true Chriſtian, but a new creature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. compare with <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 7. and 5. 6. for without the regeneration of all that is degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, there is no Salvation, nor entrance into Gods Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And therefore ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles were the true Preſidents and Patterns of Chriſtianity, it muſt Inevitably follow from thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all the Articles of the Chriſtian faith were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and practiſed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: But baptiſm with water, in the Name of the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, was neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nor practiſed by Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, and therefore is no article of the Chriſtian faith among us Gentiles And as thoſe other Arguments from Scripture, ſo this laſt from Reaſon, is moſt infallibly true and certain.</p>

And now, to ſhut up cloſe that open door to a Libertine kind of life, let all People know (if there be any ſuch as do not know) that God is a free Agent, and may, if he pleaſe, remit all ſins and Offences whatſoever done againſt him, but without true and unfeigned Repentance, and forſaking the evil, and cleaving to that which is

good, there is neither Precept, Preſident nor Example for any ſuch thing in all the holy Scriptures, that I know of; but on the contrary it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>That GOD by no means will clear the guilty, but will render a Reward to every one according to their deeds,</hi> Exod. 23. 7. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 34. 7. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. 2. <hi>Cor..</hi> 5. 10.</p>

But unto ſtrangers that knew him not, I honeſtly declare unto them, for harmleſsneſs and Innocency, within the bounds of my knowledge, I know not his fellow upon Earth, excepting one other Man; and he hath left this Mite of his as a Token of his Love he had to the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> and for the benefit and well-being of their Immortal Souls. And he was a diligent Searcher into the innocent and harmleſs Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity, and alſo of the many Abſurdities, Falſhoods and Errors that were crept into the Name of the Chriſtian Faith,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001678_0099_0FB9807A0B1514F8"/>
and particularly this of Reprobation, that ever God did Reprobate any of his Creatures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his Creature Man, who was made in his own Image; this aſſertion being ſo diſhonourable to God and pernicious to his Creature Man, he lookt upon this to be a Monſter, and ſo hath uſed his Chriſtian endeavour in its Detection.</p>

And whether or no God hath not furniſhed out his Creature Man by his Grace, compleatly, whereby he is in enabled to perform his Creators Requirings, yea or nay? And if not, why doth God require of his Creature Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities? Or whether he be made a bounded Agent, according to this following Example.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe that a Carpenter with great pains and labour did make a Cart-wheel, and when he had made it, gave it a command to get up and run towards the Sun riſing; it having no Power given it, it naturally lies ſtill, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys its Makers command; and then the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter under the pretence of its Diſobedience, to ſhow his power over his Creature, ſhould violently fall upon his Wheel and daſh it to pieces.

was the Baptiſm commanded by Chriſt; and if thou canſt not ſhow this, thou muſt ſay they diſobeyed the Command of Chriſt, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce and practiſe another Baptiſm of their own Contrivance, which was not the Baptiſm of Chriſt.
