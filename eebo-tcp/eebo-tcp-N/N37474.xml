            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By a very great Writer of very Little Books.</byline>
            <p>MUCH might be ſaid in favour of this collection, but as we have no room for critical diſquiſitions, we ſhall only obſerve to our readers, that the cuſtom of ſinging theſe ſongs and lullabies to children is of great antiquity. It is even as old as the time of the ancient <hi>Druids. Garacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> King of the <hi>Britons,</hi> was rocked in his Cradle in the Iſle of <hi>Mora,</hi> now called <hi>Angleſea,</hi> and tuned to ſleep by ſome of theſe ſoporiferous ſonnets. As the beſt things, however, may be made <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> When that
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:049118_0003_10265B94F3FC0F48"/>great prince turned his arms againſt <hi>France,</hi> he compoſed the following march to lead his Troops to Battle, well knowing that Muſic had often <gap reason="music">

               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:049118_0003_10265B94F3FC0F48"/>the power of inſpiring courage, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the minds of good men. Of this his enemies took advantage, and, as our happy nation, even at that time, was never without a faction, ſome of the male contents adopted the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words to the King's own March, in order to ridicule his Majeſty, and to ſhew the Folly and Impoſſibility of his Undertaking.</p>
            <q>
               <l>There was an old woman toſs'd in a blanket,</l>
               <l>Seventeen times as high as the moon;</l>
               <l>But where ſhe was going no mortal could tell,</l>
               <l>For under her arm ſhe carried a broom.</l>
               <l>Old woman, old woman, old woman, ſaid' I!</l>
               <l>Whither, ah whither, ah whither, ſo high?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To ſweep the cobavebs from the ſky,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And I'll be with you by and by</hi>

Here the king is repreſented as an old woman, engaged in a purſuit the moſt abſurd and extravagant imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but when he had routed the whole <hi>French</hi> army at the battle of <hi>Agincourt,</hi> taking their king and the flower of their nobility priſoners, and with ten thouſand men only made himſelf maſter of their kingdom; the very men, who had ridiculed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, began to think nothing was too arduous for him to ſurmount, they therefore can celled the former ſonnet, which they were now aſhamed of, and ſubſtituted this in its ſtead, which, you will pleaſe to obſerve, goes to the ſame tune.</p>
            <q>
               <l>So vaſt is the proweſs of <hi>Harry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He'll pluck a hair from the pale-face moon:</l>
               <l>Or a lion familiarly take by the tooth,</l>
               <l>And lead him about as you lead a baboon.</l>
               <l>

All princes and potentates under the ſun,</l>
               <l>Through fear, into corners and holes away run;</l>
               <l>While nor dangers nor dread his ſwift progreſs retards,</l>
               <l>For he deals about kingdoms as we do our cards.</l>
            </q>
            <p>When this was ſhewn to his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he ſmilingly ſaid, that folly always dealt in extravagancies, and that knaves ſometimes put on the garb of fools, to promote, in that diſguiſe, their own wicked deſigns. <q>The flattery in the laſt, ſays he, is more inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the impudence of the firſt, and to weak minds might do more miſchief; but we have the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb in our favour: <hi>If we do not flatter ourſelves, the flattery of others will never hurt us.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot conclude without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:049118_0005_10265B9AF9CBE218"/>the great probability there is, that the cuſtom of making <hi>Nonſenſe Verſes</hi> in our ſchools was borrowed from this practice among the old <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> nurſes; they have, indeed, been always the firſt preceptors of the youth of this kingdom, and from them the rudiments of taſte and learning are naturally derived. Let none there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeak irreverently of this ancient maternity, as they may be conſidered, as the great grandmothers of ſcience and knowledge.</p>
