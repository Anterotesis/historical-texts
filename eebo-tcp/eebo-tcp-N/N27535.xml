            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SCARCELY</hi> was I delivered of this young republican Philanthropiſt, before I began, according to good Chriſtian uſage, to look about for a ſuitable god-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for it. My thoughts preſumptuouſly enough, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, inſtantly fixed on you—for two reaſons. Firſt, I was deſirous of paying to you, (as being next to God, the <hi>greateſt</hi> benefactor of my dear country) this little mite of grateful and affectionate reſpect:—and ſecondly, becauſe I well know there exiſts not on this ſide of heaven, the man who will more cordially than <hi>GENERAL WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON,</hi> approve of whatever tends to advance the harmony and happineſs of Columbia.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God, I pray him grant!</hi> that you may live to ſee us <hi>all,</hi> your <hi>loving</hi> countrymen, catching from your fair ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that reverence for the Eternal Being; that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the laws, that infinite concern for the <hi>national Union;</hi> that unextinguiſhable love for our country, and that inſuperable contempt of pleaſures, of dangers, and of death itſelf in its ſervice and defence, which have raiſed you to Immortality, and which alone can exalt us to be a great and happy republic.</p>

            <p>ALL MEN ARE EQUAL.</p>
            <p>"SOHO! What the plague have we got here now? All men equal! All men equal!!! Here's a pretty love powder for us truly—An arrant doſe of Jacobiniſm I'll warrant it, ſufficient to poiſon the nation."</p>
            <p>This is juſt what I apprehended; for ſome gentlemen, the moment they hear mention of EQUALITY, fancy they ſee a hoſt of hungry ſans-culottes in full march for deſolation, equalling all property, levelling all diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, knocking down kings, clapping up beggers, and waving the tri-coloured flag of anarchy, confuſion and wretchedneſs, over the ruins of happineſs and order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:036696_0004_100A6B93982D0E70"/>
From ſuch equality, good Lord, deliver us! But the equality now in queſtion is as different from that, as is a ſpirit of heaven from a goblin damn'd. 'Tis an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mutual dependence, of civil obligation, of ſocial affection, of dutiful obedience to the laws, and of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious co-exertion to make ourſelves and our country happy.</p>
            <p>When I ſay that all men are equal, I allude not to the endowments of mind or body. For, whether we conſider the ſize, ſtrength and activity of the former, or, the wit, memory and other faculties of the latter—there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a ſurpriſing inequality among men.</p>
            <p>As to SIZE—</p>
            <p>Some are dwarfs<note n="*" place="bottom">Of dwarfs there have been numbers; but Baby, the little Frenchman, born in <hi>1741,</hi> is the moſt remarkable. At his birth he weighed but a pound and a quarter, and was for ſome time rocked in a large ſlipper by way of cradle. When full grown he was juſt <hi>29</hi> inches tall, healthy, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and well proportioned. At <hi>22</hi> he died of old age.</note> mere pigmies, hardly a match for cranes—while others, the giant<note n="†" place="bottom">As to giants, both Ireland and Patagonia have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a great many, <hi>7, 8.</hi> and <hi>9</hi> feet high: but Goliah of Gath out-gianted all theſe by far; for he meaſured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>11</hi> feet ſtraight rabbet.</note> ſons of earth, lift their mighty forms, terrible to look on.</p>
            <p>As to STRENGTH—</p>
            <p>Some are ſo very feeble, that the weight of a graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper is burthenſome—while others, like Sampſon, among the Hebrews, or Peter Franciſco<note n="‡" place="bottom">This extraordinary man, a native Virginian, has been known to lift a cannon of <hi>1500</hi> weight, and to throw a ſtout bully over the pales of a garden with great eaſe.— He was at the famous battle of the Eutaw ſprings, where the gallant Williams, who led the hoſt of Columbia, being knocked down, the Britiſh grenadiers endeavored to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him on the ground. The Americans defended him with great bravery, and dreadful was the claſhing of the bayonets over our proſtrate hero. He was ſoon covered with the dead bodies of the combatants falling on him; Peter, being an officer, had no better weapon than a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy cutlaſs, with which however, he got a blow a piece at four grenadiers. Every blow was ready money to old Charon.</note> among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, poſſeſs a degree of bodily force that is truly aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:036696_0005_100A37609879E650"/>
As to ACTIVITY—</p>
            <p>Some men<note n="*" place="bottom">For example—Col. Daniel Boon, the ſettler of Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucky, who in his flight from the Indians, ran upwards of <hi>150</hi> miles in <hi>36</hi> hours.</note> ſwift footed as the roe-buck, can bound acroſs the fields with the motion of the winds, ſcarcely injuring the tender graſs in their rapid courſe; while others ſnail ſlow in progreſs, can ſcarcely drag their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid limbs along.</p>
            <p>As to HEALTH—</p>
            <p>Some bleſt with conſtitutions of ſteel, hardly know what ſickneſs means, as was the caſe of a Mrs. Blackney, an Engliſh lady, who on her death bed declared, that during a life of 80 years, ſhe had never felt even a pain of the head—while others enervated by ſloth and ſtrong tea, can ſeldom get through a whole day without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreadful complaints.</p>
            <p>And, as to LONG LIFE—</p>
            <p>Millions return to the duſt almoſt as ſoon as they are awakened out of it; while others, like ſuperanuated ſtrulbrugs live 'till they are quite tired of living. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Thomas Parr, an old Engliſh ploughman, who lived to ſee ten kings and queens riſe and fall from the throne of England. Such bubbles are kings, compared to cheerful labourers! He died aged 153 years. Old Henry Jenkings, (of Bolton England,) went a good vay beyond Parr, for he lived 169 years. Both of theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans were honeſt, temperate, hard working, poor men.</p>
            <p>As to BEAUTY—</p>
            <p>Some have ſo much of heaven in their looks, that a ſingle glance is enough to electrify with delight every nerve in our frames, and to throw our leaping hearts into the ſweeteſt palpitation; while others are ſo ſlightly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036696_0006_100A6B958204EFF0"/>touched with this divine magnetiſm that they attract none of our iron race, but are at full liberty to point to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven and make angels their admirers.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"E'en croſſes from our Maker's hand,</l>
               <l>"Are bleſſings in diſguiſe."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Equally great is the difference between different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in the powers and qualities of their minds.</p>
            <p>As to COURAGE—</p>
            <p>Some, like the war-horſe, rejoice, at the ſound of the trumpet and plunge with eagerneſs into the thickeſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, declaring with the mad-cap king of Sweden, that no muſic equals the whiſtling of bullets; while others like delicate court-ladies fall into a tremor at the fight of an unloaded gun.</p>
            <p>As to UNDERSTANDING—</p>
            <p>Some are ſo very dull that it is a hard matter to teach them a ſum in the rule of three; while others quickly drink dry the ſhallow fountains of human knowledge, and then boldly ſtrike out into the main ocean of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's works. Witneſs our great RITTENHOUSE, of whom it' was well ſaid by the Vice-Preſident of the United States, that, "though he never made a world, yet he came nearer to it than any man ever did."</p>
            <p>And witneſs too our ſage FRANKLIN, who, though bro't up a poor Printer's boy, ſoon learnt the art to chain the thunderbolts of heaven and to bid fierce lightnings play harmleſsly about our buildings. "E coelo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina eripuit, ſceptraque tyrannis."</p>
            <p>AS to ELOQUENCE—</p>
            <p>Some, like our famou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s PATRICK HENRY, can lead the paſſions of men about, with as much eaſe as a countryman calls his pigs after him; while another hardly has utterance ſufficient to declare his paſſion to a pretty milk-maid.</p>
            <p>As to HUMANITY—</p>
            <p>One is ſo tender hearted, that like the amiable Dr. GOLDSMITH, he can ſay to a little captive fly, "go poor thing, there is ſurely room enough in this great world for you and me;" while another can pickle the raw hide of a poor ſlave, for breaking a tea-cup.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:036696_0007_100A6B978C401FA8"/>
As to BENEVOLENCE—</p>
            <p>This, like the man of ROSS, will ſell his elegant pictures and plate, to aſſiſt his diſtreſſed tenant; while that, will diſtreſs his tenant, ſelling even the bed from under his ſick wife and children, to raiſe money for gawdy pictures and plate.</p>
            <p>Thus there appears a moſt ſurpriſing inequality between men, both in mind and body; an inequality almoſt as great as that between angels and men, or between men and children. This inequality is ſo very ſtriking, that ſome, when told, that all men are equal, burſt out into a hearty laugh, treating it as a ſilly French conceit.— Such gentlemen will perhaps keep up the laugh when they hear that this inequality among men, as individuals, is the very cauſe of their equality as a ſocial body.— That great philoſopher, Paul of Tarſus, has explained this ſeeming paradox in a moſt beautiful and maſterly manner. He compares the various members in the body of ſociety to the members in the human body.— "We have all, ſays he, many members in one body; ſome of theſe occupy a high place, as the head; ſome a low, as the feet; ſome appear to enjoy great honor; the eye which ſees beautiful objects, the ear which hears ſweet ſounds: while others, the poor feet, are obliged to plod on the ground liable to be bruiſed by ſtones or defiled by mud." But notwithſtanding this apparently great inequality among the members, they have no juſt cauſe of pride or diſcontent. The foot has no reaſon to envy the eye, nor the eye to inſult the foot. They are all equally dependent on one another, equally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the perfection of the body, and to each others welfare. For, what could the eyes do without the feet? Or how could the feet do without the eyes? With the like admirable wiſdom, God has placed together the members which compoſe the great body of ſociety.— Some are rich, ſome poor, ſome wife, ſome ignorant, ſome ſtrong, ſome feeble. Theſe though ſeemingly very unequal, are yet perfectly equal, in their mutual depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in their abſolute need of one another. The wife are like eyes, to ſee, for the ignorant; the poor, like the feet, to plod; ſome, like the head, to contrive;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036696_0008_100A6B9934EE6A40"/>others, like the arms, to execute. Some were made to direct; others to obey; theſe to labour with their head, and thoſe with their hands. None of theſe can do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſt. As in the body, the head cannot ſay to the foot, "I have no need of you"; ſo in ſociety, the richeſt man, nay, the greateſt king cannot ſay to the pooreſt tradesman, "I have no need of you"; for the laced coat that glitters on his back, the ſword which graces his ſide, the chariot in which he rolls, the palace wherein he lives, the books that amuſe his mind, the muſic that enchants his ear; all theſe, and the ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other conveniences and elegancies of his life are the joint production of as many different artificers. Were it not for theſe ingenious poor men, what would become of the greateſt monarch on earth? Why, he would ſoon find himſelf a moſt neceſſitous and wretched being. To be more ſenſibly convinced of this, let us ſuppoſe the proudeſt Nebuchadnezzar that ever ſcoffed contempt on his poor ſubjects, to be placed in a ſituation where he could derive no aſſiſtance from them, and mark the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure his haughty kingſhip makes. "With a flint to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahawk he hacks down a dozen or two of ſapplings; theſe he ſets up on end, ties at the top, and covers with bark and mud, leaving a hole juſt big enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his dog to creep in and out at. This is his wigwam, his caſtle, his palace. In the midſt of this he kindles up a fire, around which he yawns and dozes away his gloomy winters. With no cloaths but ſkins torn from the quivering limbs of Wolves and Bears, no food but acorns and the carcaſes of ſuch animals as he has maſtered by his club and bow; no muſic but hiſſing ſerpents, ſcreaming wild cats, or the ſtorm howling thro' the foreſt."</p>
            <p>Thus deſtitute is the condition, thus imperfect the happineſs of the man who has none to help him. His abilities, though the greateſt ever beſtowed on man, are infinitely inſufficient to procure thoſe innuinerable feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of which his kind Creator has rendered him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. His body embraces a number of ſenſes ſuch as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, taſting, &amp;c. which are ſo many pleaſant inlets to a vaſt variety of gratifications; add to this,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036696_0009_100A6B9B6091D078"/>his mind, with its capacities, for all the far ſublimer pleaſures of knowledge, virtue, beauty, painting, poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, harmony, &amp;c. ſo numerous, that nature herſelf with all her exhauſtleſs treaſures can hardly ſupply them.</p>
            <p>But how utterly impoſſible it is for an individual to acquire all theſe things for himſelf, muſt inſtantly occur to any one who conſiders what a world of induſtry, time and ingenuity it takes to invent and carry to perfection a ſingle art or ſcience: then how paſſing abſurd to think that any one man though armed with the ſtrength of Sampſon and the wiſdom of Solomon, can manage the thouſand arts and ſciences which exalt the citizen above the ſavage, which ſweeten and embelliſh life, and which from the moſt helpleſs of the animal creation render man the lord of the world! No: this is the work, not of ONE, but of MYRIADS; a work to be effected by men not as ſolitary, ſcattered individuals, but as the members of a compact all powerful ſociety.</p>
            <p>Let us now view them in their aſſociated ſtate. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their extreme feebleneſs while alone, they come together for mutual ſafety and benefit. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious talents which God has diſtributed among them individually, are now brought into the common ſtock and exerted for the general good. Some contribute great bodily ſtrength, others increaſe that ſtrength by the aid of art and ingenious inventions: the old counſel the young, the wiſe teach the ignorant, the bold encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the timid; and as fifty thouſand men, taken indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, have but little ſtrength or terror, but conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated into an army, furniſhed with proper weapons aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diſcipline, and led on by brave commanders, they become unſpeakably formidable. So, when the talents and ſtrength of thouſands (though inſignificant in the individual) are collected into one great ſocial body, aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by arts and acting in harmonious concert, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a force that is truly aſtoniſhing, and can with eaſe accompliſh things beyond the reach of imagination. See them now, like a noble band of brothers, bending to the glorious toil. The deepeſt mines cannot conceal their precious metals. Furnaces and forges begin to blaze and thunder. Iron and ſteel are faſhioned into tools.—
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036696_0010_100A6B9D4118C300"/>Quarries of ſtone and marbles are dug up and poliſhed for buildings. The ſtrongeſt animals are ſubdued and put into their ſervice; the bounding horſe, the ſturdy ox, and even the mighty elephant lends them all his powers. Nothing can reſiſt their force. Old ocean roars and foams in vain. Tall ſhips riſe upon the ſtocks, ſuck the yielding flood and plough the main in queſt of foreign luxuries. The aged foreſt falls beneath their ſounding axes. Elegant houſes are erected; the fields are ploughed, meadows drained, and orchards planted. Adorned with fruits and flowers, the earth ſmiles like the garden of God. Their barns are filled with plenty, and their preſſes burſt out with new wine. Royal dainties, even cakes of wheat-flour with marrow and fatneſs, are piled upon their tables; while their wardrobes are filled with fine linnens and purple, and with ſilks dyed in the rich colours of the ſhowing arch!</p>
            <p>Thus abundantly ſupplied with all the neceſſaries and conveniences of life, they now get leiſure to cultivate the fine arts and to taſte of thoſe far ſublimer pleaſures of which God has rendered them capable. Painting and printing are invented, by the help of which we can take a view of all the great men and mighty nations of ancient or modern days. Their origin, wars, vices and virtues, with all their intereſting conſequences, are ſet before us, to our infinite entertainment and inſtruction. Muſic is ſtudied, that magic art, whoſe wondrous notes can waken every paſſion of our ſouls, and charm our ſenſes into rapture. Poetry too is cultivated, that aſtoniſhing power which tranſports us out of ourſelves, and lifts our thoughts to heaven.</p>
            <p>Who, without the ſweeteſt emotions of gratitude, can caſt an eye over this immenſe feaſt, this royal banquet of delights which the great king has ſpread for us his ſubjects? Or who can meditate, though but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on this pleaſing wondrous theme, without feeling that great truth; the natural equality of men? Does not every man, rich or poor, equally covet theſe felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life; and is he not, of himſelf, equally unable to procure them? Are we not equal in our wants, and equal in our inability to ſupply them without the help
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036696_0011_100A6BA048C55898"/>of others, and therefore equally dependant on one another? Without our brethren we can do nothing, no, not even make a hoe or a hatchet; but united with them, ſupported by their ingennity and ſtrength, we can look on this world with all its rich furniture as our own, and gratefully exclaim with the Poet.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"For us kind nature wakes her genial power,</l>
               <l>Suckles each plant, and bloſſoms every flower.</l>
               <l>Annual for us, the grape, the roſe renew</l>
               <l>The juice nectarious and the balmy dew.</l>
               <l>For us the mine a thouſand treaſures brings,</l>
               <l>For us health guſhes from a thouſand ſprings.</l>
               <l>Seas roll to waft us, ſuns to light us riſe,</l>
               <l>Our foot ſtool earth, our canopy the ſkies."</l>
            </q>
            <p>What virtuous min I can think of theſe things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out catching impreſſions the moſt deſirable, without feeling ſentiments the moſt tender and benevolent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his fellow-men? We have ſeen that, it is not good for man to be alone; that alone, he is a feeble helpleſs wretch, living in a world ſtored with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand bleſſings, but which, Tantalus-like, he has not power to taſte; that alone, he is but as a poor ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked ſailor caſt on a deſolate iſland, where he is hard put to it for berries and roots to keep him from ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But that in our aſſociated ſtate, we are like a great family of brothers whom God has placed together as mutual aids, and has endued with ſuitable talents, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to one, that to another, ſo that we can now moſt eaſily command all the conveniences and elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a happy life. O how cloſely ought theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to unite us to our ſpecies, how powerfully do they bind it upon us to love one another? Is it not as much a law of nature that we ſhould love one another, as it is that the members of the body ſhould love one another? As that the eyes ſhould love the feet for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them to gaze on the dear objects of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Or, that the feet ſhould love the eyes for directing them to ſlowery walks to ramble in?</p>
            <p>This endearing light in which nature herſelf teaches us to view one another, is enough one would think to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036696_0012_100A6BA375008EC8"/>baniſh all hateful paſſions from our boſoms, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, pale, heart ſickening envy. Envy! Merciful God! Whom ſhall we envy? Our own fleſh and blood kindly multiplied into a thouſand brothers, and placed around us on purpoſe to adminiſter to our happineſs! And for what ſhall we envy them? For thoſe very tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and poſſeſſions which God has conferred on them for our own good, and which will be the more for our good, in exact proportion as they poſſeſs them in a more eminent degree. This were a ſin not only againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but utterly unknown to nature. Do the members of the body ever repine at each others perfections?— Does the foot repine becauſe the eye is quick ſighted to ſee a thouſand charming objects; becauſe the ear with admirable nicety can diſtinguiſh enchanting ſounds; or becauſe the arms are ſtrong and able to get an abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of good things? No: they rejoice in each others perfections, as in the inſtruments of their own glory and happineſs. In like manner, ought not every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the great body of ſociety to rejoice in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his brother member? Am I a poor man, ought I not to rejoice that God has beſtowed great riches on my neighbor, who can undertake works of great public uſefulneſs and give employment and bread to thouſands of poor men and their families? Am I weak and ignorant, ought I not to thank God for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my neighbor wiſdom to invent and to inſtruct me in thoſe arts which make my life ſo much more eaſy and comfortable? Am I timid and fearful, eaſily fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened out of my rights—ought I not to be thankful that my neighbor has courage to riſe up in my behalf and to defend me againſt him who would be too ſtrong for me? Am I rich, never ſo rich—I have equal cauſe of gratitude that I am not left to ſtarve amidſt my piles of guineas and half-joes, but that God has kindly placed around me thouſands of poor brothers, all ready, this with his ſtrength, that with his ingenuity; one with this charming are, another with that, to add to me all the comforts and pleaſures of life! And indeed if I be wiſe, I ſhall thank God more cordially for diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe talents among my brethren, than if they were
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036696_0013_100A6BA5370A2620"/>all concentered in myſelf. For, had I the talents to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as great a Sta eſman as Adams, as profound a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher as Franklin, as ingenious a Phyſician as Ruſh; yet all theſe eminent talents would be of little uſe to me or to others, becauſe I ſhould not have time to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them. But diſtributed as now they are moſt wiſely, among the maſs of the citizens, one talent to this, and another to that, they are all cultivated to the higheſt perfection, and conſequently prove eminently uſeful both to the poſſeſſor and to the public.</p>
            <p>This endearing view of human kind, this looking on our neighbor as ourſelf, kindly multiplied into many members, into many dear brothers for mutual good, muſt ſhew us as with a ſun beam what a horrid thing it is for one man to hurt another! What a moſt horrible abuſe of God's goodneſs, moſt monſtrous perverſion of his bleſſed deſign to abuſe to the heavieſt curſes, thoſe very talents which he gave us for richeſt bleſſings to one another!</p>
            <p>That power which God gave you to protect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and to frown the diſorderly into good behaviour, will you abuſe it to overawe the poor, and to frighten them out of their rights?</p>
            <p>That ſuperior genius which he gave you to inſtruct your brethren in arts and happineſs, can you abuſe it to overreach and defraud them? That manly ſtrength which God gave you for their aſſiſtance, can you cruelly turn it againſt them?</p>
            <p>That precious gift of ſpeech which was given you to hold ſweet converſe with your brethren, can you moſt wickedly abuſe it to blaſt their characters, and to make their very appearance vile and odious?</p>
            <p>That wealth which was given that you might be a guardian angel to the poor, will you like a Demon abuſe it to their corruption and ruin?</p>
            <p>That noble courage which was lent you to fly to the defence of your countrymen unjuſtly invaded, can you moſt horribly abuſe it to their deſtruction, in worſe than brutiſh battles, and worſe than develiſh duels?</p>
            <p>What if you were to ſee the teeth tearing the fleſh from the bleeding arms, or the arms ſtabbing and mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036696_0014_100A6BA8F8E5D390"/>the quivering body, would not the very ſight freeze the blood in your veins, and fill your ſouls with horror! how then muſt it affect how torture the ſoul of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſee us men, whom God peaced here to live in love, thus dreadfully abuſing our powers to curſe each others exiſtence, and to cruſh one another into an untimely grave! Poor deluded mortals! We may call ourſelves men of honor, but ſurely it will be more tolerable in the day of Judgment for bloody ſavages, than for ſuch men of honor!</p>
            <p>This great doctrine "the natural equality of men," founded in our equal wants and equal inability to ſupply them, ſuggeſts the great duty of exerting ourſelves for the common benefit. He who neglects this deſerves not to be called a good man, for he withholds from the community the bleſſings which he might confer, &amp; by meanly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his ſhoulders from the common burden, he cruelly throws too great a part of it upon others. Such a man, inſtead of riſing as is fooliſhly imagined, by ſuch a life of idleneſs and diſſipation, degrades himſelf into the condition of an ungrateful beggar, who lives upon the labours of others without making any return.</p>
            <p>And beſides, what can ſink a man more even in his own eyes, than that he has done nothing to ſerve his neighbors, to benefit his poor relations, to educate and eſtabliſh his own children, or to advance the intereſt and glory of his country; in fine, that he has buried his talents, defeated the kind intentions of heaven in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing them, and that if he were cut off by death, his place would not be miſled, nay, the world would be happily delivered from an uſeleſs burden.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, what nobler ſatisfaction can any perſon enjoy than in the reflection, that, no day paſſes over his head but ſees him diligently employed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting his own and the happineſs of mankind: that he not only ſupplies others with many of the good things of this life, but endeavors by his good example to raiſe their joyful views to a far brighter world. An exalting conſideration this, and one equally open to the poor and to the rich; for as in the natural body, the ſmalleſt joint, the ſmalleſt nerve and fibre, contributes
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036696_0015_100A6BAB76610D10"/>to the ſtrength, elegance and uſefulneſs of the whole; ſo in the ſocial body, the general peace and happineſs depend on the good behavior of the lower claſſes, eſpecially as theſe are by far the moſt numerous. Hence it is not to be doubted, that the meaneſt laborer, the pooreſt ſlave, who cheerfully exerts himſelf in the duties of his place, has a right to ſhare with the moſt exalted of the ſons of men, that glorious tide—the friend of mankind and the ſervant of God.</p>
            <p>This great doctrine "the natural equality of men," ſweeps away all ground of pride from the rich, and of dejection from the poor.</p>
            <p>Some of the great nabobs of the earth, long accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the cap in hand homage of the poor, may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps like to be told that there is no difference between the rich lord in his ſilks, and the poor black-ſmith in his lea her apron; no odds between the learned doctor in his velvet cap and morocco ſlippers, and the ſimple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettered ploughman.</p>
            <p>Inconſiderate mortal! who can take airs upon your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and deſpiſe your poor brother becauſe he is ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and you learned. You underſtand Latin and Greek, and can talk of Comets and Eclipſes, and yet after all, the Cobler is a more independent man than you are, for he can do better without your Comets and Eclipſes, without your hic, haec, hoc's, than you can without his ſhoes.</p>
            <p>And you my monied friend who are pleaſed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe yourſelf quite independent of mechanics and trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men —worth a hoſt of blackſmiths, butchers and bakers, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Suppoſe theſe good people were all to riſe up in wrath, and ſwear by their ſledge-hammers, awls and ovens, that you ſhould have no more meat, bread nor cloaths; no more elegant houſes, carpets or plate, what would become of you? Unable, like them to work, and yet aſhamed to beg, what a ſad chop-fallen figure you would make!</p>
            <p>Every thing ſhews "the natural equality of man." If the philoſopher confers a favor on the ploughman by inventing for him a plough, the ploughman requites the favor by uſing it, and thereby ſupplying the philoſopher
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036696_0016_100A6BADF75AEDD0"/>with bread. If the artiſt does a great ſervice to the ſailor by building him a ſhip, the ſailor comes along ſide of him, by navigating his ſhip through the ſtormy ocean and bringing him the rich commodities of foreing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Thus we all depend on each other like the linke in a golden chain, which tho' not all preciſely of the ſame ſize are yet equally eſſential to the beauty and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the whole. Break but one link and the reſt are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> but little uſe. Thus, take away any one claſs of the citizens—e. g. the cultivators of the earth, and what ſhould we do for bread? Take away our mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics, and of how many conveniencies ſhould we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived? Take away our men of genius, and what a number of noble arts and inventions ſhould we loſe? Take away our poets, painters and muſicians, and how many ſweet embelliſhments would be loſt to ſocial life? And if our gallant ſeamen and ſoldiers, our Truxtons'. Tingeys', &amp;c. were to be taken from us, how inſecure would be all the riches, elegancies and pleaſures acquired by the ingenuity and induſtry of the other claſſes!— Thus as in the natural body no member could be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putated without great detriment to the whole, ſo in the ſocial body no claſs of the citizens could be taken away without great detriment to the reſt. Thus has GOD, the common PARENT, removed far from us all ground of pride on the part of the rich, and of dejection on the part of the poor—" the rich and the poor, ſays Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, meet together, the Lord is the maker of them all." In his view all good men are equally honorable, and none of them are more or leſs worthy than another; but in as far as he diſcharges or neglects the part allotted him and increaſes or diminiſhes the ſum of general hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>Since then no individual has either time or talents to procure the materials of a happy life, without an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate union with his fellow men in ſociety—it is very plain that God intended man for ſociety, and it is as plainly his intention that good laws and government ſhould be introduced among them. As in the human body thoſe numberleſs ſinews which give it all its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are not left at liberty to diſtort and convulſe it at
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036696_0017_100A6BB0470568B8"/>pleaſure, but are wiſely confined by ligamentous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages which will not allow their irregular and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cramps: juſt ſo the members of the political body require to be confined within the bounds of their duty and uſefulneſs. The weakneſs of human nature ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this neceſſary; for when men leaving their caves and dens firſt came together, they were neither Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons nor Saints, but a rude ſelfiſh race, too ready to lay light hands on whatever pleaſed them, and to knock down all who diſpleaſed them; and at this day there are but too many of the ſame mohawk principles, ready to rob, to ſlander, and even to murder their neighbors in duels. Yes, the Iron reſtraint of the laws is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and laws require rulers to execute them—for it would never do for a whole country to quit their ploughs and convene to make laws to puniſh criminals. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons muſt be elected by the people and inveſted with their authority to make good laws and to ſee them rigorouſly executed, "to the terror of evil doers and to the praiſe of them that do well."</p>
            <p>Hence appears the exceeding obligation of civil obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, an obligation the greateſt of all others, our duty to God excepted. Indeed this conſtitutes a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of our duty to him; for God deſires above all things the happineſs of man. But as man cannot be happy without ſociety, nor ſociety ſecure without laws, nor laws effectual without rulers, nor ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers beneficial unleſs they are dutifully obeyed—it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that CIVIL OBEDIENCE is infinitely pleaſing to God. 'Tis the accompliſhment of his favorite wiſh and therefore he looks on it as paid to himſelf, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſtly too: for as we are to be their ſubjects, God has been pleaſed to delegate to us the power to chuſe ſuch laws and rulers as we ſhall think moſt likely to make ourſelves happy. And ſince in chuſing theſe we are but uſing the right which God himſelf put into our hands, expreſsly to make ourſelves happy according to his bleſſed will; it follows that the rulers which we choſe are, in fact, of God's chuſing.—"Let every ſoul (cries that nobleſt of patriots St. Paul,) be ſubject to the higher powers (the rulers) for they are ordained of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036696_0018_100A6BB1D9D31198"/>God—(yes, ſurely when choſen by the majority of the people) whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the rulers, reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to themſelves damnation." No wonder that the great preſerver of men is ſo anxious that we ſhould du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully obey our rulers, for it is indeed the greateſt of ab ſocial bleſſings, the grand principle of union, ſtrength, order, peace, and happineſs to a nation. Embraced in this golden band, we are no longer feeble, crumbled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, but the force of millions is collected and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted as a mighty man. The ample ſhield of a nation's power is ſpread over each virtuous character. Under its awful ſhade we enjoy ſafety and peace. The ſons of violence are curbed, the bloody effects of individual rage and reſentment are happily checked. The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt if innocent, is a match for the mightieſt, having the force of the whole community to take his part.— And, beſides, claſped in the foſtering boſom of his country, he can partake of all the conveniencies and pleaſures procured by the art and induſtry of his fellow citizens, and at the ſame time following his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite buſineſs he can gather the rich fruits of it for his own and the good of others. Thus, ſecure in each others protection, thus abundant and happy in the ſweet rewards of their mutual labours, they can eat, drink, and rejoice together like brothers, under the ſhade of their own vine and fig-tree, none daring to make them afraid. O how goodly a thing it is to ſee a whole nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on living thus together in unity! A ſingle inſtrument of muſic artfully touched, affords much delight, but how much more delightful to hear an hundred different inſtruments all mingling their ſweet notes in one grand concert! So, to ſee one man living prudently and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, affords a heartfelt ſatisfaction; but to ſee thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands and millions living harmoniously together, under the ſame excelient laws, all cheerfully engaged at their ſeveral works, and moving on ſmoothly in their proper ranks: the rulers wiſely leading, the people dutifully following, and all lovingly accompanying one another.</p>
            <p>This is a ſpectacle worthy the eyes of bleſſed angels; nay, God himſelf looks down delighted upon them, the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036696_0019_100A375DBAE4B8A0"/>Father of the univerſe regard, them with ſmiles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency: He ſees the travail of his ſoul and is ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Since ſo many and ſuch precious pleaſures and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ariſe from good government, what virtuous man can otherwiſe than moſt cheerfully pay his part of the taxes neceſſary to its ſupport. O let us not wait 'till juſtice knitting her brow declares, that ſince we deſire ſo much from government, we are bound in equity to contribute to its maintenance; let us not wait 'till the great lover of men thunder forth his orders—"for this cauſe (the welfare of government) pay you taxes alſo, for they are God's miniſters attending on this very thing:" No, let generous ſentiment, let a grateful ſenſe of the numberleſs bleſſings we receive from our excellent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment render it a pleaſure to us to contribute to its ſupport, its honor and peace. In no country have the people ſuch reaſon to pay their taxes cheerfully as in this; for in no country do they derive ſo much from government, or pay ſo little to it.</p>
            <p>In Great Britain which is thought to be the happieſt government in Europe, they tax every thing, even the elements cannot eſcape them. They tax the air above, the earth beneath, and the waters under the earth. And as if all this was not enough, as if wearied of this little peace meal kind of work, they have made lately a ſhort apoplectic ſtroke at once of ten percent ad valorem, that is, one hundred dollars out of the thouſand every year—in addition to a thouſand little hectic taxes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. But in this country, thanks to God, our taxes are ſo very trifling as juſtly to excite our aſtoniſhment. That a man dwelling in a comfortable houſe, rated at 150 dollars; a plantation of 500 acres, (called a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality in Europe) and 3 valuable ſlaves, making in all 3000 dollars, ſhould be taxed ſcarcely 3 dollars for the whole. Is not this moſt aſtoniſhing! and are there. Americans who can think this oppreſſive who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay it, can berate and go near to kill their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers juſt for aſking this well earned pittance, can even fly in the venerable face of the parent country, blowing up the flames of a bloody and expenſive inſurrection!
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036696_0020_100A6BB796A46AD0"/>O tell it not in England, publiſh it not in the ſtreets of London, leſt the toil-worn porters throwing their heavy burdens from their backs, ſtamp on the earth in wrath, and curſe us all for fools!</p>
            <p>Many of the poor, to my knowledge are not quite ſo chearful in paying their taxes as good citizens ought to be, becauſe they have been taught (God forgive their teachers) that all the money goes to the Preſident and to the quality, i. e. the great folks. This is ſo far from being true that the very reverſe of it is true; that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the poor paying taxes for the rich, the rich pay taxes for the poor. The really poor pay nothing, nay, thoſe in circumſtances that may be called comfortable pay nothing. e. g. with 99 dollars and 99 cents, you may build a very ſnug houſe, a much better one than Abraham, Iſaac or Jacob ever lived in, and in which you and your loving dame with half a ſcore chubby roſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeked boys and girls may live as merry as crickets, and yet your country does not aſk you a copper for your houſe, the ſcene of all this innocent mirth. But Mr. Bingham of Philadelphia, one of the quality, living in a houſe that coſt 30,000 dollars, pays no leſs than 270 dollars yearly.</p>
            <p>Again, you own a heavy waggon and team: with this, Jehu like, you rattle along the high ways, tear up the roads, break down the bridges, and ſet the poor road menders to curſing and ſwearing, and after all, what is your tax? Why not even a ſharp-ſhin. But lo! here comes one of the quality in a little gim-crack phaeton and Lilliputian pair, not a tythe the ſubſtance of your waggon—a carriage that makes no more impreſſion on the roads than does a cat running over a harpſichord, and yet this gentleman pays a tax of 9 dallars.</p>
            <p>No, no, my brothers, if you be really poor, you pay nothing, even though your poverty ſhould be owing to your own ſhameful love of eaſe, or of whiſkey, you pay nothing! Your dear country, like the ſtrong eagle of heaven gathers you her pooreſt her unfledged-neſtlings, under her wings, and imparts to you her vital warmth and ſtrong protection, with no other motive than love: or no other pay than the pleaſure of doing it. O then
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036696_0021_100A6BB91BA18838"/>let not for gratitude, for juſtice ſake, let not the ſons of Belial deceive you by bringing up an evil report againſt this good land. But admitting that you were treated as are the poor in many countries, where the needieſt Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is obliged to throw in her mite, the wretchedeſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus his crumb or his ſcab for the ſupport of government; admitting I ſay, that you were conſtrained to dowſe your half bits, do you think that they would all go to John Adams and to the quality! No, not, a cent beyold what was their well earn'd wright. As every vein in the body ſends on its tax of blood to the heart, the great treaſury from whence it is quickly driven on again thro' the large and ſmall arteries to each well fed fibre in the ſyſtem; ſo, under our conſtitution, which nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the human body, (that moſt perfect of all God's works) every guinea or cent that is taken up by thoſe great abſorbents, the Sheriffs, is carried ſtrait on to the treaſury, from whence in a very few pulſations, it is diſtributed among the ſervants of the public, thoſe wife and brave men whom you yourſelves have choſen to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend your laws, or to fight for you. Aye, my dear country men, if you did but confider what coſt, fatigue and danger theſe gentlemen encounter to ſerve you, you could not, I am ſure you could not, grudge your mite to reward them. A part of this little money, that each of you gives, goes to your Judges, your Aſſembly men, your Senators, &amp;c. Now do but reflect how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of dollars theſe gentlemen have laid out on their education and libraries to enable them to cope with the long-headed Pitts and Talleyrands of Europe.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo, the brain-racking, ſpirit-waſting, hard, fleſh-conſuming ſtudy theſe poor gentlemen are obliged to undergo for your ſakes: as proof of this, look at your Jefferſons, Maddiſons, Marſhalls, Harpers, &amp;c. ſee what pale, penſive, werter-looking countenances they generally wear, obliged every now and then to creep off to the ſprings, to brace up their lax fibres.</p>
            <p>A part of your little taxes goes to your brave ſoldiers, and to your gallant ſeamen, your Truxtons, your Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geys, &amp;c. Noble fellows, who have exchanged their wives and ſmiling babes for the gloomy waves, that they
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036696_0022_100A6BBBEEF95C30"/>may there enjoy the heroic pleaſure of meeting your enemies. Conſider what they undergo for you. While "you are on your down-beds lying, fondly lock'd in beauty's arms," they poor fellows, may be preparing for very different ſcenes, making ready for bloody battle. See the hoſtile man of war bearing down upon them. The hearts of the youthful warriors palpitate, while the blood comes and goes in their cheeks; but the love of their country, the juſtice of their cauſe, and a noble ſenſe of honor brace them up as with triple ſteel. "All hands to quarters—fore and aft, a clear ſhip—up ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks —light the matches, and ſtand by to wake the thunder—now my hearts be ſtout and bold." The flag of Columbia waves over their heads, the heroes eye the beloved ſtripes. The ſmile of joy is on their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the fire of valor flaſhes from their eyes.— They demand the fight. The tall black ſhip of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is now cloſe along ſide; her tremendous artillery ſtares them in the face, yawning for deſtruction. The dreadful fray begins; the air is rent with their horrid thunder. Old ocean trembles and lowers all her waves. The ſhips are wrapped up in flaming fire, while ſtorms of Iron bullets daſh every thing to pieces. The decks are covered with mangled corpſes, and the ſcuppers run torrents of blood. But lo, the mortal ſtrife is ended, and Columbia is victor. But alas! what avails it that her flag rides triumphant, many of her braveſt ſons lie low. Hearts that glowed with heavenly fire, that beat high with the love of their country; muſcles that were glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtrained at the four and twenty pounders, fighting for you my brothers—Theſe now lie in mangled heaps hardly known that they ever were men; their deareſt blood mingling with the briny waves, their precious limbs ſoon to be toſſed to devouring ſharks!!! O my countrymen, can we think of theſe things and yet deem it hard to pay a tax of one little dollar in the thouſand to our gallant brothers, who thus at the expence of their lives ſecure to us the other nine hundred and ninety-nine.</p>
            <p>But not only on account of the exceeding moderation of our taxes, but alſo of their amazingly equal diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have reaſon to pay them with more cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036696_0023_100A6BBE59D192C8"/>than any people on earth. In other countries, the political body is ſo grown out of all proportion, the head and larger limbs are ſo bloated with fat, while the inferior members are ſo ſhrivelled for nouriſhment, that it is hard for a cordial love to grow between them. That a biſhop ſhould receive his 10 or 15000<abbr>l</abbr> ſterling per ann, ſhould ride in his coach, live in his palace, and keep up a conſtant carnival, while his poor brother Levite is obliged to lent it all the year on a pitiful curacy of 20<abbr>l</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>That a king ſhould receive his twenty or thirty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand dollars per ann. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>le the hard working mechanic is put to it for bread, and after all his toils and ſorrows is ſcarcely able to keep his family out of priſon or a poor houſe; and as if all this was not enough, that the government ſhould ſuffer a hoſt of penſioners and ſinecures-men, each with a large ſalary, to be clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped like ſo many elegant cupping glaſſes on the vitals of the people.</p>
            <p>Who could ſuffer this without a decline of love for his country, or indeed without feeling that love turn'd into deteſtation?</p>
            <p>But O happy Americans! we groan under none of theſe iniquitous impoſitions to wean us from our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; with us the political body ſtill preſerves its exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſhape and ſymmetry: the head is not bloated, the feet are not ſtarv'd. Our public officers (the head) are furniſhed with plenty, but not exceſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Few of our public officers, viz. our Judges, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Aſſembly. Senate, Congreſs, &amp;c are allowed more than they could make by their reſpective profeſſions, many not ſo much. And as to our good old Preſident, though his 25000 dollars have made a great noiſe, yet 'tis queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable whether it be a cent too much. He is placed in a ſituation of all others the moſt public and expenſive. His levee, his table, &amp;c. muſt conſume vaſt ſums. It were high treaſon in him to eat his veniſons, or to drink wine by himſelf. He is expected to act the national publican, to keep open houſe, and to entertain comers from all the winds of heaven. Think of that my brothers.</note>; while our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036696_0024_100A6BC009838048"/>citizens (the feet and hands) may, if induſtrious, have enough, and to ſpare.</p>
            <p>Another conſideration which muſt rivet the ſouls of all reaſonable men to our conſtitution, is that charming delicacy, that profound and equal reſpect, with which ſhe treats the religious opinions of her children. Even in that government, which is looked on as the moſt equit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Eaſtern world, (I mean Great Britain) the people are at daggers drawn about religion. The Ups inſiſting on the Downs to think of God Almighty, and to worſhip him juſt as they do, or to dowſe their money. Oh! this is a ſhameful thing, a dreadful draw-back on patriotiſm! What, ſhall I ſweat and bleed in ſupport and defence of my country, and when I expected her ſweeteſt ſmiles, her kindeſt careſſes, ſhall ſhe moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully reject my petition to ſay what prayers I think beſt; ſhall ſhe look tamely on and ſee my hard-earned ſubſtance ſold by the ſheriff to ſwell the princely revenue of ſome biſhop, to whoſe church I belong not? He muſt be an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no gall, whom this would not provoke to deteſt his country as a cruel ſtep-mother, and to turn his back on her forever. But, thanks to God, we have none of theſe pontifical vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamies to wean our affections from our country, or from one another. We are perfectly at liberty to worſhip our Maker, every man according to the dictates of his own conſcience; and provided we act up to the high character of good citizens, our excellent conſtitution ſtands equally a wall of fire around all, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, Chriſtians or Mahometans.</p>
            <p>O my beloved mother country! my ſoul embraces thee with more than filial ardour for this thy wiſe and equal love to all us thy dutiful children, and for that thou alloweſt no eſtabliſhment to create heart burnings among us, no mercileſs Prieſt with fire and faggot to roaſt us to death.</p>
            <p>And O my dear brothers, native or adopted ſons of Columbia! If ever people on earth were under particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar obligations to love their country, we are that people. Our land is ſignally favor'd of heaven and our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has every thing to make it dear to us. Bought by
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036696_0025_100A6BC2955C4AD0"/>the deareſt blood of our Fathers; planned by our ableſt Legiſlators; approved by our firmeſt Patriots; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the ſacred majoriy of our nation: It ſtands on the broad baſe of Equity; maintains inviolate the juſt rights of every cirizen; ſecures to all alike their civil and religious liberties; and to all alike holds out the faireſt opportunities to riſe to wealth, to uſefulneſs, and to glory. O bleſſed land of well ſecured liberty, of equal laws, of moderate taxes, and of univerſal tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! where no king can trample, no ſtateſman oppreſs, not prieſt can perſecute us; but where all, like an equal band of brothers, cheerfully cultivating our ſeveral tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, may enjoy more happineſs than can be found in any other nation on earth! What dutiful ſon can think of all theſe thy truly republican favors without claſping thee to his heart as thy deareſt beſt of mothers, who gave us our birth, nurſed our helpleſs infancy, ſupports our manhood, and laviſhes on us a profuſion of every earthly good. Or what prodigal ſon who conſiders the huſks fed on by the poor in other lands, but their plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of bread at thy table O Columbia, but muſt inſtantly exclaim, "I will ariſe, and will go to the arms of my country." Volney aſſures us, that in the Holy land the people are ſo wretchedly poor, that to avoid ſtarving they uſe ſo much cockle and wild ſeeds in their bread as often ſickens them—and that he actually ſaw at the gates of the once flouriſhing Damaſcus a couple of meagre, half naked wretches contending with hungry dogs over the carcaſe of a dead camel. O that we did but know in this our day the many felicities we enjoy under this our government, and did but love the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as we ought!</p>
            <p>But how ſhall we manifeſt our love? By ſplitting into parties and mortally hating one another? No, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid; for a furious party ſpirit is the greateſt judgment, the heavieſt curſe that can befal our country. It extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes love in the beſt hearts, and in the worſt it blows up the coals of hatred to ten fold fury. It makes even good men ſhy of one another and breaks off the ſweeteſt friendſhip. This vile ſpirit deforms every thing; by giving a hardneſs to the features and a fierceneſs to the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036696_0026_100A6BC55F381890"/>eyes it turns the lovelieſt woman into a Fright, and the comlieſt man into a Demon. It pollutes the moſt ſacred places, introducing unnatural ſtrifes even there where ſweeteſt harmony ſhould ever ſound; in our ſtreets and at our tables. It fills our newſpapers which were meant to be the vehicles of innocent amuſement and calm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, with the bittereſt abuſe, provoking to bloody battles and murderous duels. It confounds all the great diſtinctions of worth and villainy in characters; the vileft creature, the baſeſt Arnold, if on our ſide, is cried up as an angel; while an angel if he oppoſe us, though never ſo decently and for ever ſo good reaſons, is brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a miſcreant! It corrupts our taſte; the dirtieſt newſpaper printer, if he blackguard for us, is applauded as a Junius; while a Junius, if againſt us, is execrated as a mere Billingsgate writer. It baniſhes all ſenſe of gratitude, juſtice, and truth. What ſignifies the pureſt innocence, the uprighteſt intentions, the greateſt abilities, the profoundeſt learning, if oppoſed to us, they vaniſh into nothing; the greateſt abilities are hooted at, the brighteſt virtues are not ſeen, the longeſt and faithfuleſt ſervices are all forgotten under the bias of this moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenious ſpirit—JEFFERSON is an empty Pedant, FRANKLIN and old Fool, ADAMS a Britiſh Agent, and WASHINGTON—let faction write the reſt! It ruins all our public affairs; the bleſſed end of ſociety and government is to unite men in promoting their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intereſt, but the aim of party ſpirit is to diſunite them entirely. Overlooking the general good, the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of each faction, (I mean the deſigning men) is, to advance their own ſeparate ſtrength, and to ſink their opponents in the public eſteem, calumniating the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt characters, charging the wiſeſt meaſures with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the beſt intentions with villainy; thus fiding the minds even of honeſt men with prejudices againſt their rulers, and oppoſition to taxes, which, by compelling govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to uſe coercive meaſures, bring on inſurrection and civil war with all their horrors: when brother with worſe than helliſh fury ſhall ſheath his ſteel in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's heart, or call in ruthleſs foreigners to aid the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed deed; and when God, the righteous Judge, in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036696_0027_100A6BC6F1B098A8"/>puniſhment of ſuch unnatural monſters, ſhall allow theſe foreigners to ſwallow up their ſubſtance, to fill their land with blood and violence, and to fix the gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chain of ſlavery on them and poſterity for ages!</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, 'tis ſtill in our power to eſcape this political damnation, and to become the happieſt of all nations; the remedy is ſimple, and is contain'd in the following admirable precepts of an inſpired writer:— "HONOR <hi>all men</hi>—LOVE <hi>the brotherhood</hi>—FEAR GOD—HONOR <hi>the king.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Let us honor all men; yes, even thoſe who differ from us in political ſentiments. They may love their country as dearly as we do, and may, with equal ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be aiming at her beſt intereſts, though they do not approve the ſame means. They may be more in the right than we are aware. Let us treat them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and never diſgrace our character and cauſe by rudeneſs and reviling, by "raſh ſuſpicions and unmanly ſlander."</p>
            <p>To make this more eaſy and pleaſant; Love the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood. Let us remember that we are the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials wrought by the great. Architect, into thouſands of ſprings, wheels, and cogs, of different ſtrengths and ſizes, but to make up the ſame grand harmonious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine; that we are the ſame fleſh and blood wonderfully multiplied into millions of brothers, and wifely gifted with different talents and a paſſion for ſociety, to make up one great political body. O then let us live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as brothers, treating each other's ſentiments with reſpect, making proper allowance for education, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, abilities and company; overcoming thoſe who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us, by ſoft words, ſound arguments, and good lives; and wifely recollecting that violent oppoſition even to the moſt abſurd opinions, inſtead of breaking, will rivet the chains of error, and preclude all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of future conviction. And O, if our own happineſs is dear to us, let us forever remember that in exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as we leſſon our mutual love we leſſen our own happineſs; we diſſolve the golden bands of union, we become weak, contemptible, and an eaſy orey to any cruel and wutchful enemy. D.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:036696_0028_100A6BCAB743DF78"/>
Let us fear God; that is the only firm baſe on which the happineſs of individuals, the proſperity of nations can reſt ſecurely. It is the only root from which every branch of duty can ſpring in full vigor, be fed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened, It gives courage in danger, moderation in proſperity, and contentment in poverty. It inſpire the Ruler with inviolable honor, the common citizen with cheerful obedience, and pours over all, the rich bleſſings of unanimity and public virtue.</p>
            <p>And next to God, let us honor his repreſentative on earth, that is, the Supreme Magiſtrate, whether called King, Emperor, or Pieſident. If he be choſen by the general voice of the people, he is God's own miniſter, for God deſigns above all things the happineſs of man; man's happineſs requires ſociety, ſociety laws, and laws a magiſtrate: therefore a magiſtrate choſen by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is in fact choſen of God, and every good man, Deiſt or Chriſtian, will honor him as ſuch. And thank God, we have a Chief Magiſtrate, who is, and has, for a great many years, been "a miniſter of God to us for good," one whom we can honor with alacrity, not coldly as from duty, but cordially as from love; love, for his great virtues, love for his eminent ſervices to our dear country. For, who firſt alarmed our country againſt Britiſh encroachments? Our Preſident. Who firſt rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the indignation of our oppreſſed Colonies? Our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident. Who for his flaming zeal in our behalf was proſcribed by the Britiſh government? Our Preſident. And yet, who adventured through an ocean of Britiſh cruiſers to beg for his bleeding country the help of other lands? Our Preſident. Who decided the grear queſtion for AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE? Our Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Who in ſpite of French intrigue negeciated a peace moſt advantageous and glorious for his country? Our Preſident. And who, for ſeven and twenty long years has ceaſeleſsly toiled to advance our nation to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and happineſs? Our Preſident.</p>
            <p>Now, who can have any claim on our gratitude, or on our confidence, if this man has not. Who can meditate on all theſe his great ſervices, without feeling a fire kindling and breaking out in earneſt prayers to heaven,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036696_0029_100A6BCD8C4A2228"/>for its richeſt benedictions on his head—that venerable head now grown grey in our cauſe!</p>
            <p>"Father of life and love, thou God ſupreme! in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy look on our nation, and on our Chief ruler, whom thy providence has ſet over us. O may his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels be guided by thine eternal wiſdom, his loins girded with ſtrength, and the arms of his hands be made ſtrong by the arms of the mighty God of Jacob, ſo that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who hate us without cauſe may ſtand in awe; and that our children's children may enjoy all the bleſſings of peace and love, while the ſun, moon, and ſtars ſhall endure!"</p>
            <p>Happy, thrice happy, if we would but all love one another as members of the ſame body, and heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the ſame glorious work, the diſcharge of our duties. The rich cheerfully employing their wealth for the good of the poor; the poor their labour for the convenience of the rich: the ſtrong their power to defend the weak; the wiſe, their abilities to inſtruct the ignorant, and every one, his reſpective talents to re-eſtabliſh the golden reign of juſtice, mercy, and truth. Wiſe and bleſſed above all nations ſhould we be, if we would but adopt ſuch a conduct—a conduct honorable to human nature. and worthy of chriſtianity, which repreſents men to each other as children of one parent, as members of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, journeying together through the chequer'd ſcenes of this tranſitory world, towards a region where all the diſtinctions of rich and poor, high and low, are unknown, and where virtue alone ſhall be exalted, and vice degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forever.</p>
