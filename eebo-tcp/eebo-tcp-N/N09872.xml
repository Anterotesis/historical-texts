            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE TESTIMONY OF THE Monthly Meeting of FRIENDS in PHILADELPHIA, CONCERNING OUR DEARLY BELOVED FRIEND, <hi>DANIEL STANTON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN John the Divine was in exile in the iſle of Patmos, "He heard a voice from Heaven, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Write,—Bleſſed are the dead, who die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea ſaith the ſpirit, that they may reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and their works do follow them;" —which we believe now is the portion of our worthy friend, concerning whoſe faithful ſervices we are engaged from the united motives of love and duty, to give this teſtimony; deſiring, that all who read it, and more eſpecially the Youth, may be excited, by his example, to ſeek an
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:012565_0003_0F8B15C226ACE8D0"/>
early acquaintance with the Lord, and to take up their daily croſs in the prime of their days.—Thus, they alſo, may become ſhining lights and inſtruments of good to others.</p>
            <p>HE was born in this city, in the year 1708, and his father dying before his birth, and his mother a few years after, he ſuffered great trials and hardſhips when very young:—Being early con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſeek the knowledge of God, he had a fervent deſire to attend religious meetings, though ſubjected to many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and diſcouragements, before that privilege was allowed him; yet, being earneſt in his deſires to obtain divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, he was eminently ſupported under great conflicts and probations, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing faithful to the degrees of light and grace communicated, a diſpenſation of the goſpel miniſtry was committed to him, ſometime before the term of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip was expired; and abiding under the ſanctifying power of truth, he grew in his gift, and became a zealous faithful miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:012565_0004_0F8B15C5A912E480"/>HE was very exemplary in his induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and diligence, in labouring faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his trade, to provide for his own ſupport, and after he married, and had children, for their maintenance; and was often concerned to adviſe others to the ſame neceſſary care; yet he continued fervent in ſpirit for the promotion of truth and righteouſneſs, ſo that he was ſoon engaged to leave home, and the neareſt connections of nature, to publiſh the glad tidings of the goſpel,—and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſited moſt of the meetings of Friends in this and the adjacent provinces, and ſeveral times as far as the eaſtern parts of New-England. Having thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly diſcharged his duty among us above twenty years, and feeling his mind conſtrained in the love of the goſpel, to viſit the few Friends who remained in ſome of the Weſt-India iſlands, and from thence the meetings of Friends in general through Great-Britain and Ireland, he communicated his concern to a few of his moſt intimate friends, who having unity therewith, he was encouraged to lay it before our monthly meeting.—Before he entered on this weighty ſervice, he paſſed
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012565_0005_0F8B15C652E762D0"/>
through a near trial and affliction in the death of his beloved wife; under which exerciſe he was graciouſly ſupported by the arm of divine ſtrength, which had often been revealed for his help, in times of inward conflicts and outward diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>HIS concern to travel in the ſervice of truth continuing, and the meeting having full unity with him therein, he embarked in the fifth month, 1748, accompanied by our dear friend, Samuel Nottingham, in a veſſel bound for Barbadoes, and having viſited the few meetings in that iſland, they went by way of Antigua to Tortola, where they continued ſome time, having ſome difficulty to get a paſſage to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; and their voyage thither was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome ſingular hazards and dangers, which occaſioned their landing in Ireland; where our friend Daniel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome months, viſiting the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Friends in that kingdom;—and after he apprehended himſelf clear, went over to England, and viſited the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings generally in that nation, and in Wales and Scotland, where his meek circumſpect conduct and converſation,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:012565_0006_0F8B15C6AFBE6980"/>
and lively edifying miniſtry, rendred his viſit very acceptable and his memory precious.</p>
            <p>IN his return home, and for ſome time after, he was in a low afflicted ſtate of mind; being apprehenſive, that through diffidence, and the want of perfect reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the divine will, he had omitted fully performing the ſervice required of him, by not viſiting the few Friends in Holland: yet he was mercifully preſerved, and after a time of deep exerciſe, raiſed again to ſing of the mercies and loving kindneſs of God on the banks of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>HE ſeveral times, with other Friends appointed to that ſervice, viſited the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Friends in this city, and between the years 1757 and 1760, being accompanied by our friend John Pemberton, he viſited the families of Friends generally within, the limits of our meeting; which weighty exerciſing ſervice, he was enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to our edification and ſatisfaction. After which, he was frequently engaged
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:012565_0007_0F8B15C76B193BD0"/>
to excite Friends to this uſeful and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing practice.</p>
            <p>IN the twelfth month, 1760, he ſet out on a viſit to the meetings in the weſtern parts of this province, and from thence in Maryland, Virginia, and North and South-Carolina, and returned in the ſixth month following; ſince which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſited many of the meetings near home, and ſome as far as Long-iſland, and other parts of the province of New-York. Within the laſt two years, he viſited the families of Friends of ſome of the meetings in Weſt-Jerſey, in the city of New-York, and part of Long-Iſland; and after his return from this ſervice, with great peace and ſatisfaction, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his apprehenſion that he was now clear of all places, and that his ſtay here was near over;—having an evidence, that he had been faithfully concerned from his youth to fear and ſerve God.</p>
            <p>HIS chief labour and religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes were in this city, where he was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent attender of all our meetings, and
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:012565_0008_0F8B15C82C592640"/>
often on committees appointed on the ſervices of the church; in which he was ſolid and weighty in ſpirit, waiting for the ſpringing up of life, being ſteadily concerned both in and out of meetings, to live near the divine fountain: Thus he was very frequently qualified, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſtir up the pure mind, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the gracious dealings of God to Mankind, and as a faithful embaſſador to warn the negligent to flee from the wrath to come, and to excite the people to bring forth fruits anſwerable to the great mercies graciouſly beſtowed on us; and was ſometimes conſtrained to declare in a prophetic manner, a day of trial, in divers inſtances, very ſhortly before ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon came to paſs.</p>
            <p>HE was of late deeply exerciſed in conſideration of the evils of the horſe races, ſtage plays, drunkenneſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther groſs enormities encouraged and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in this city; cloſely exhorting our youth againſt thoſe pernicious and deſtructive devices of the enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and under the awful ſenſe that God
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:012565_0009_0F8B15C93A29CD10"/>
will judge and puniſh the wicked and evil doers, he was often fervent in public ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, that the Lord would lengthen out the day of his merciful viſitation, and yet try the people longer; which ſeaſons were ſolemn and humblingly affecting; manifeſting, that although he was very cloſe and ſharp in reproof againſt evil, yet moſt tenderly concerned, that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the righteous law of God might be prevailed with to repent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and live.</p>
            <p>HIS love for the riſing generation was very great; which he manifeſted by his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate notice of them, and eſpecially of thoſe who were religiouſly inclined, and his houſe was open to receive ſuch, his converſation with them being ſeaſoned with grace, and his counſel inſtructive and helpful to thoſe who had ſeeking deſires after the knowledge of truth, often lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly inviting them to come, taſte, and ſee, that the Lord is good; greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, that all who profeſs the truth, might walk agreeable to its dictates and be led thereby, as our worthy predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:012565_0010_0F8B15C9ECC3F218"/>
were, into that meekneſs, humility, and godly ſimplicity and plainneſs, which rendered them conſpicuous and ſhining examples, and that none might reſt ſhort of the enjoyment of the life of religion, his zeal being great againſt ſuch, who have the form of godlineſs, and by their actions manifeſt they have not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof;—and he often fervently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd and cautioned thoſe who are eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſuing the world, and by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting cares, and graſping after <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> treaſures, fruſtrate the good purpoſe of the viſitation of divine grace to them, and cloſely reminded thoſe, who in their ſmall beginnings were low and humble, that now they were abundantly favoured, they ſhould not ſet their affections on things below, but remember the rock from whence they were hewn;—and his concern was great that thoſe who had the glad tidings of the goſpel to publiſh, might be true examples to the flock, and adorn the doctrine they had to deliver by a circumſpect life and converſation, and where any by not ſteadily keeping to that which would have preſerved them,
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:012565_0011_0F8B15CD594C5568"/>
had involved themſelves in difficulties, either by letting their minds out to the gains and profits of this world, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, his travail was great for ſuch that they might be brought through, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cloud and miſt removed.</p>
            <p>HE was much employed in viſiting the ſick and afflicted, to whom he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred his ſpiritual advice and experience, and often engaged in humble prayer for their ſupport; and in the diſtributing to the neceſſitous according to his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, he manifeſted his benevolent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>AS he had been many years under great exerciſe and ſuffering of ſpirit on account of the ſlavery of the poor Africans, and frequently bore teſtimony againſt that unrighteous gain of oppreſſion, he was of late ſomewhat relieved, as he found the eyes of the people become more open to ſee the iniquity of the practice; and he died in faith, that the light of the goſpel will ſo generally prevail, that the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of chriſtianity will find it their duty
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:012565_0012_0F8B15CD79130DB0"/>
to reſtore to theſe people their natural right to liberty, and to inſtruct them in the principles of the chriſtian religion.</p>
            <p>ON the fifth day of the fifth month, he was violently ſeized with the bilious cholic, and continued in great pain ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days; but afterwards being ſomewhat eaſier, he was at our morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meetings on Firſtday, the thirteenth of the month, in which he was much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in his public miniſtry, and expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he thought his time would not be long with us. After this day's labour, he was again confined, yet being a little recovered he as at our meeting on Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the twenty-fourth of the month, which being ſmall, he expreſſed his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it, and encouraged Friends to diligence in the attendance of week day meetings, the benefit of a faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of duty therein being great;— the next day he was at our monthly meeting, and to his own and our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was enabled to ſtay through both our ſittings, though the laſt of them was longer than uſual, and he afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

that he thought himſelf better in the meeting than when out;—it was a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of divine favour, and ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters being before the meeting, he with great openneſs ſpoke pertinently and clearly to them, encouraging Friends to the ſupporting and maintaining our chriſtian teſtimony, againſt all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: This was the laſt public meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was at, being the next morning early ſeized with a renewed attack of the ſame diſorder, which increaſed on him ſeveral days, and was ſo fixed, that all the endeavours of ſeveral ſkilful phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and tender nurſes, were not effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to remove it, tho' in ſome meaſure to mitigate the pain, that he ſuffered much, not being able to lie down in his bed ſeveral weeks, yet thro' all he was mercifully ſupported, in much reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and patience, rather inclining, if it was the Lord's will, to be releaſed.</p>
            <p>FOR two or three weeks before his ſickneſs, he appeared very deſirous of ſettling every thing he had to do reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affairs of this life, and deſired a
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:012565_0014_0F8B15CEF0BB2C88"/>
Friend to review and tranſcribe the ſhort memoirs he hath left of his travels and religious ſervices, and to write his will, which he executed the day before he was firſt taken ſick, and then appeared eaſy in his mind.</p>
            <p>DURING the time of his ſickneſs he often expreſſed his concern leaſt his Friends ſhould be too anxious for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, ſaying, if he ſhould live longer, and thro' any human frailty or infirmity occaſion any reproach, it would be a cauſe of ſorrow to them.</p>
            <p>BY the deſire of his Friends who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, he rode out ſeveral times, tho' not without much difficulty, and ſpent the two laſt days of his life at the houſes of two of his intimate Friends. As he drew near his end, the ſtrength of his love to mankind in general, and his Friends in particular, evidently increaſed, much deſiring the proſperity of truth, and when a meeting time came had an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to be with Friends, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the day before his departure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:012565_0015_0F8B15D0164CC168"/>DURING his ſickneſs, he frequently expreſſed himſelf in a very ſeaſonable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, and affecting manner; and the evening of the Firſtday before he dyed, ſeveral Friends coming in to ſee him, he ſpoke a conſiderable time to them, having before been deſirous of ſuch an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the company of his Friends, to ſit down and wait upon God, which was his great delight.</p>
            <p>THE laſt day of his life he ſpent at the houſe of his Friend Iſrael Pemberton, at Germantown, and was unuſually free and chearful, even till ten o'clock at night, when he undreſſed himſelf, and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bed, remarking on lying down, that he had not before been able to do ſo, for five weeks or upwards, and he ſoon after fell aſleep, but in a ſhort time was awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the return of pain and difficulty of breathing, which thro' his illneſs he had been much afflicted with, ſo that he was oblig'd to ſet up in bed, and thus continued, at intervals freely converſing with our ſaid Friend, who ſat up with him, and he expreſſed his great thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:012565_0016_0F8B15D0853C9380"/>
that his head was preſerved free from pain and his underſtanding clear, and that though it had been a time of cloſe trial and deep probation, he could ſay he felt the evidence of divine ſupport ſtill to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him.—After which, his pains increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he got up and dreſſed himſelf, and walking about the room ſometime, ſat down in an eaſy chair, in which he fell into a ſweet ſleep, and in about three hours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted without ſigh or groan.</p>
            <p>THUS died this righteous man, who having fought the good ſight and kept the faith, finiſhed his courſe in full unity with us, and univerſally beloved by his fellow citizens, on the twenty eighth day of the ſixth month, 1770, in the 62d year of his age and 43d of his miniſtry. His body was the next day attended by a large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people of divers religious denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to our meeting houſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards interred in Friends burial ground in this city.</p>

               <p>IN a grateful ſenſe of the many helps and great goodneſs of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to my ſoul, whereby he has been pleaſed from my young years to incline my heart to fear and ſerve him; it is on my mind to leave ſome account of my life, travels, and experience; wiſhing it may be a means to ſtir up the pure mind in any, to obey the will of the Lord, and to ſerve him, while they have time and

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The place and time of his birth.</note>BY the account I have had, I was born in the year 1708, in Philadelphia, in the province of Pennſylvania, of honeſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Daniel and Abigail Stanton, and it was my hard lot ſoon to be deprived of them both; my father I never ſaw, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt at Sea ſometime before I was born; and my mother died when I was a child, ſo that I have but little remembrance of her.</p>
               <p>AFTER her death, I met with great hardſhips, both of body and mind, being deſtitute of parents, and of brother or ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that I was in a lonely ſtate, and went to live at ſeveral places a ſhort time, the laſt of which (before I was put apprentice) was in New-Jerſey, with my mother's brother; during which time, I went
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012565_0019_0F8B15D366A6C680"/>
through great difficulties, too tedious to mention.</p>
               <p>I LIVED there ſeveral years, and had no opportunity to go to any place of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip; but the lord was pleaſed by his grace and good viſitation, to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on my mind, that I was made to dread and fear the great almighty Being, and it was given me to know, that
<q>God is a ſpirit, and they who worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and truth;</q>
and through the bleſſed knowledge of <hi>God</hi> by his holy ſpirit, I had great reproof in my own breaſt for ſin and tranſgreſſion, and dreaded to ſpeak bad words, or to do what was evil, and was brought by inward conviction to mourn, and ſeek for mercy for my ſoul; and at a time when I heard of the ſuffering of my dear Saviour on the croſs, and how he ſuffered unto death, my heart was broken before the Lord, and I went alone and wept, being much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſenſe of his ſuffering by that hard hearted people, <hi>the Jews,</hi> and of his being crucified:—Great was the goodneſs of the Almighty to me, in giving me a
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012565_0020_0F8B15D52B59C358"/>
ſenſe of many things appertaining to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in the time of this tender viſitation; and I found by the divine witneſs in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that if I would be a diſciple of Chriſt, I muſt take up my croſs daily, to that which diſpleaſeth God; he being greatly to be feared and obeyed, and was worthy of the deepeſt reverence that my ſoul, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſtrength could aſcribe to his all powerful name.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH it was hard to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral part to become ſlain to the recreations and pleaſures of this life; fervent were my cries and ſeeking after the ways of the lord, and I thought much of eternity in another world.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendance of meetings for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note>I HAD heard of many forms of worſhip, but had no opportunity to be with the people for that ſervice to God, which was a great trouble to my mind; but at one time I aſked leave to go and ſee a relation, with an intention for him to ſhew me the way to the meeting of Friends, which was held at New-town in Gloceſter county; he was loath to take the pains to accompany
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012565_0021_0F8B15D5E228D3C8"/>
me, not knowing the ſolid deſire of my mind; but through perſuaſion, I prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him to go with me to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where I was more deſirous to get ſome good, than to be ſeen of men. We ſat in a part of the meeting together, where we were not much noticed by any that I know of, and in this bleſſed oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, through the power of truth, and the good teſtimony of that dear ſervant of Chriſt, <hi>John Eſtaugh,</hi> being attended with the authority of the word of life, my heart was greatly contrited and my ſpirit baptized in the preſence of God, it was a joyful day of good tidings to my poor ſeeking ſoul, and the eminent and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful advice, that did attend that worthy inſtrument in the Lord's hand for my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, has been like
<q>bread caſt upon the waters that has been found after many days.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I WENT from that meeting much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the way of worſhip of Friends, and continued earneſt in ſpirit, that I might have further knowledge of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed truth; my inward exerciſes were a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012565_0022_0F8B15D67B5B57D0"/>
great deal of ſorrow and mourning, that I might come forward in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and do that which was right in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>LIVING with my uncle till near the age of ſixteen years, I became uneaſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to learn a trade, not knowing what I might have to depend on for a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, more than the labour of my hands; altho' my mother left conſiderable at her death, under the care of thoſe who ſhe expected would do juſtly by me; but it proved otherwiſe, they depriving me of the whole, to a ſmall matter, leſs than twenty pounds: I went on trial to a ſhip carpenter in Philadelphia, in condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my uncle, it being a trade he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe for me, than I did for myſelf, and was there ſometime, tho' I ſoon was diſſatisfied both with the trade, and on account of the wicked converſation of the people of the yard, who being very vain, were a great exerciſe to my mind; tho' my maſter and miſtreſs were kind and friendly to me, which was ſome comfort; but the greateſt ſatisfaction I had in this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012565_0023_0F8B15D739C29348"/>
world, was that I could attend religious meetings on the firſt day of the week, and was often favoured to hear the truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the demonſtration of the ſpirit and power, as alſo a ſecret divine power being at work in my heart, afforded ſolid pleaſure and profit, in the midſt of my trials; for, being ſoberly inclined, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting to attend religious meetings, I met with ſcoffings and mockings, and ſome in an outrage would bid me go along to meeting, deſpiſing my diligence on that account; but I was enabled through mercy and grace, to bear revilings as well as many deep diſtreſſes, which fell to my lot; being much concerned to ſeek after the kingdom of God, and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; oh the inward travel that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, none knew but the Lord! And at an evening meeting near where I ſat, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way from the door, Benjamin Kidd, a Friend of the miniſtry, then on a viſit to this province, from Old-England, came in and ſat juſt by me, and in the meeting was eminently favoured in prayer, which I have many times thought was a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtance of divine mercy to me, in ſo
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012565_0024_0F8B15D7F9E75958"/>
deep a travel of ſoul and ſpirit, as I had to wade through in ſeveral reſpects at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip.</note>AFTER being ſome time at the ſhip carpenters trade, which not being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me, I went again to my uncle's, where came a Friend from Philadelphia, who having ſeen me when I lived in town, would have me to go apprentice to him, he being a joiner; which I accordingly did, believing it would be of good ſervice for me to have a trade to depend on; and ſerved with him until I was about the age of twenty two years, and in the time of my apprenticeſhip, the goodneſs of the almighty was great in preſerving me through my tribulations, which were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, beyond my ſetting forth; but the pure love and fear of the Lord, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying my ſpirit, and through the divine appearance of light and grace,<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> I was led in a cloſe walking before him; and my underſtanding was opened to have a ſight of many things, which the ſpirit of truth leads into; ſome whereof were plainneſs in ſpeech and cloathing, few words in

converſation, watchfulneſs and prayer, chooſing rather to be alone, than in the company of thoſe whoſe diſcourſe and talking was out of the fear of God.</p>
               <p>I MUCH delighted in retirement, and often walked alone and poured out my complaints before the allſeeing eye, that knew the condition of my heart, deſiring that he would be pleaſed
<q>to create in me a clean heart, and to renew a right ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within me.</q>
I wanted to know the work of reformation effectually carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, according to the mind and will of the bleſſed truth, and the nearer I kept to what it made manifeſt, the greater ſtrength and dominion was given me to overcome the defilements of the world; and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern came upon me in obſerving the pride and vain glory of the times:—I had very few acquaintance, and was rather deſpiſed and derided by ſome, who overlooked the Juſt Witneſs of Grace in themſelves;
<q>I choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin, for a ſeaſon;</q>
                  <q>The ſufferings of this preſent time worketh for

us,</q>
as the apoſtle ſaith,
<q>a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</q>
and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed peace, that our dear Lord gives to thoſe who follow him whilſt here, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſufficient to the ſincere in heart, to hold out to the end.</p>
               <p>THE countenance and good example of faithful Friends had a great reach on my mind, and when I came to be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the dealings of the Lord, and could get frequently to religious meetings, and beheld the ſitting of his ſervants, and attendance of his miniſters, I could ſay, as did the queen of the South, who came from far to ſee the wiſdom of Solomon, that the one half had not been told me, and one greater than Solomon was in the midſt of his people; praiſed be his great name, even the name of Chriſt our dear Lord, that greatly appeared in power and majeſty in Sion in thoſe days, to the tendering my heart and ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him time after time, and not only eminently viſited my ſoul, by his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light and truth, but ſent many of his ſervants among us, from far and near,

filled with goſpel rain, to the watering the heritage of God; and the Lord, the maſter of our aſſemblies, was pleaſed to faſten their teſtimonies as nails in a ſure place.</p>
               <p>AFTER many powerful ſeaſons of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace,<note place="margin">His firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</note> being favoured to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living, as alſo
<q>to taſte and handle of the good word of life,</q>
a great concern of ſoul came upon me to open my mouth in a public manner, for the cauſe of religion, and the proſperity of Sion, which was a great and weighty work for me to engage in, being one of the meaneſt in this world, as I thought, and an apprentice lad, reaſons would ariſe in me againſt ſo great a duty, not knowing how I might be uſed by my maſter, and whether it might agree with the unity of Friends, they being a great and wiſe people in this city, and by their knowledge and experience, were gifted with a ſight of ſpiritual things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my low capacity, as well as zealous for the good cauſe of God in their day.— I waded for a conſiderable time through
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012565_0028_0F8B15DDC9C7B150"/>
much trouble and ſorrow of ſpirit, leſt I ſhould go too faſt, or before my divine Guide, for they who go before they are ſent, cannot profit the people, or have peace in themſelves, and peace to me and to do the will of the Lord, was what I moſt deſired; oh! the earneſt prayers that were in my heart that I might be rightly directed in all things, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praiſe of my bleſſed Lord and maſter; and a degree of his mighty power would lay ſuch conſtraints upon me, that for Sion's ſake I could not reſt, and for Jeruſalem's ſake I could not hold my peace; ſo that after many powerful influences of the divine word, at about the age of twenty years I appeared in a few words, in prayer, at an evening meeting, in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, and after this, ſometimes in a few words by way of teſtimony, as they were put in my heart, in a great deal of fear and dread of the Almighty Being; and Friends bore with my appearance with much tenderneſs, and the miniſtry of thoſe who were largely gifted in the myſteries of the kingdom, and like ſcribes well inſtructed thereto, that could bring
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012565_0029_0F8B15DDE9D3C380"/>
out of the treaſury things new and old, would correſpond with what I had to ſay in the fear of Lord; which bleſſed helps, together with the evidence of peace in my own breaſt, gave a confirmation to my mind, that I was in the way of my duty.</p>
               <p>AFTER I came forth in this laborious exerciſe, I dreamed a dream, or ſaw in a viſion, that I was as a little child born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and my mother was very tender of me (who I have thought to be the church) but there was an enemy that ſought my life, and as though he would deſtroy me, but ſhe that was my mother made her eſcape, and carried me into the wilderneſs, and we were preſerved.—At another time when I was much concerned in ſpirit for acceptance with the Lord, I dreamed that I was travelling in a path, in which I met with ſome difficulties, and got through them and met with death, and a man came with a book, and it was ſaid that my ſoul was acceptable with the Lord. I have had great cauſe to ſpeak well of his excellent name for the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſecrets to my underſtanding, as I kept in his holy fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012565_0030_0F8B15DEABD2B060"/>ABOUT the time that I firſt appeared in words in the congregations of the Lord's people, and ſometime before, the glorious day ſpring from on high powerfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared amongſt us, and ſeveral were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſpeak to the praiſe of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and to bear teſtimony to his great and good name, three before I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and two afterwards; the firſt were Mary Nicholls, Benjamin Trotter, and Mary Emlen, the next were Joyce Marriot, and Elizabeth Widdifield, who continued ſerviceable miniſters among Friends. I thought it might be ſaid to be a time in ſome meaſure of the fulfilling the prophecy of the prophet Joel,
<q>I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall prophecy, your old men ſhall dream dreams, your young men ſhall ſee viſions; and alſo upon the ſervants, and upon the handmaids in thoſe days, will I pour out my ſpirit.</q>
Joel ii. 28, 29, 30. The plainneſs, zeal, and pious example of many Friends in thoſe days, made them as lights in this city, and inſtructors to me to follow them, as they followed Chriſt; and as I kept inward before the Lord in

his rear, he was pleaſed to reveal his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mind and will, in things concerning the Goſpel miniſtry, which is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from man nor in the will of man; but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt; and as I grew in the gift communicated to me, he was pleaſed to give me an open door in the hearts of his people; praiſed be his great name for ever more! And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I had drawings in my mind to go to a neighbouring meeting, and what I had to ſay in their hearing was well received.</p>
               <p>AFTER I had ſerved out my appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip, I wrought journey-work,<note place="margin">Expiration of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> and lived with my maſter until his death, which was ſoon after I was free, and then wrought with another Friend in the city ſome time, when having an opportunity to go to Rhode-iſland, the place where my father was born, and ſeveral of his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions living there, I was deſirous to ſee them, and while I was apprentice having an account of ſome eſtate that was my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, laying in that country;<note place="margin">1731. His firſt journey to Rhode-iſland.</note> on this account, and to ſee my relations and Friends, I took a journey in the year

1731, with Henry Frankland, from Old England, who came to America, on the ſervice of truth, and being about going to thoſe parts, was ſo kind as to take my company. He was a ſolid exemplary wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friend, whoſe miniſtry and goſpel la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was to edification among Friends. My undertaking this journey was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Monthly-Meeting, and Friends were pleaſed to give me a certificate.</p>
               <p>THE firſt meeting we went to, was at Burlington, and from thence to ſeveral others in New-Jerſey, as Little-Egg-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Maneſquan, Shrewſbury and Wood-bridge, and ſo to New-York, and to meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the Main, and the Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Fluſhing, and to Friend's meetings pretty generally on Long-iſland; ſeveral of which were much to ſatisfaction and comfort; and I was glad to ſee and find the near unity that was among Friends, where our lot was caſt.</p>
               <p>FROM this iſland we went through Conecticut, which was a baptizing time to me, being a young traveller, not much

acquainted with the difference of places, and behaviour of people from home, their converſation, as alſo their principles, through that government being greatly different from Friends, and altho' high in profeſſion of religion, ſeemed to me very little acquainted with the light and ſpirit of Chriſt. It was a dark time, in which I went through much deep inward ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We paſſed along until we got to Kingſtown, near Rhode-iſland, where we had a meeting, and then had one on Connanicut, and attended the Yearly-Meeting at Newport, Rhode-iſland, which was very large, and I hope a good meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a ſolid remnant. My Friend Henry Frankland, whom I accompanied ſo far, proceeded on his journey to viſit Friends in New-England, and I ſtaid in order to get my outward affairs ſettled, and to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit ſeveral Friends on that iſland, one of which was that dear and worthy Friend Jacob Mott, whoſe countenance ſhined and appeared as a follower and ſervant of Chriſt, it did me good to ſee him, and when I took my leave of him, his ſolid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me made laſting impreſſions on my

mind.—After I had ſtaid ſome time at this place, and had ſeen my relations and Friends, I returned back to Philadelphia, where I had known in an extraordinary manner, the gracious dealings of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and I endeavoured to ſeek coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of him to know where I had beſt ſettle myſelf in the world, and it ſeemed moſt ſuitable for me to continue in this city, where I wrought journey-work at my trade ſometime; after which I rented a ſhop, and ſat up for myſelf, humbly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Lord to add his bleſſing to my endeavours, not that I craved great things, but that by an honeſt induſtrious care I might have what was needful, as food and raiment, and deſired
<q>to do juſtly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God.</q>
And the abundant mercies and bleſſings wherewith he was graciouſly pleaſed to make way for me, both in things ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and temporal, were and are gratefully to be remembred by me, his goodneſs and peace being as a ſtream of living water to my ſoul, when favoured to drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.</p>

                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:012565_0035_0F8B15E3E67BBEE0"/>I WROUGHT hard at my outward call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when at home, yet not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined but that I kept cloſe to religious meetings; in which the good preſence of Chriſt our dear Lord, would many times overſhadow them, and I have had to ſit under the ſhadow thereof with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and after ſuch precious meetings with his people, I found my mind better qualified to attend to my neceſſary buſineſs and the affairs of life; and when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of truth would ſpring in my heart to viſit religious meetings in places adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey, I freely gave up to go to them, and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured therein in the love of truth, in which I found great ſatisfaction, and with many Friends, the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, and I hope in places my labour was of ſome ſervice; the praiſe of which I freely attribute to my great Lord and maſter Jeſus Chriſt; bleſſed be his holy name! he ſuſtained and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and through his gifs and grace preſerved me in the fear of God; his fear was a fountain of life as well as unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure in my firſt ſetting out in the

               <p>IN the year 1732,<note place="margin">1732.</note> I found freedom in my mind to accompany my uncle Thomas Chalkley to viſit ſome of the meetings of Friends in Bucks county and New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, and afterwards Cheſter county; in the performance of which we had near fellowſhip together, and Friends were kind, and I believe glad to ſee us; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of thoſe meetings were large, and I hope comfortable to many. He was a near fellowhelper to me in my religious labours for the promotion of truth, and a bright example in the meekneſs and patience of the lamb; I do not know that I was ever

From Rhode-iſland I took meetings in my way to Nantucket, where on my arriving I was kindly taken home by Nathaniel Starbuck, whoſe heart and houſe were open to receive the meſſengers of Chriſt.— On this iſland I met with a great number of choice exemplary Friends, and had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral meetings among them, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve tended to edification. Being clear of this place, I returned to the Main, and taking meetings in my way, came to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where I ſpent ſome time with Friends, both in public meetings and in their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; they being loving to me and glad of being viſited, their number being ſmall in the whole, but ſeemed to be well treated by people of other perſuaſions, far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

from what it was in the early viſits of Friends to that place, in which ſome of the ſervants of the moſt high, ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death.

on my way homeward, viſiting the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings generally as they came in courſe, alſo ſome back places, and at Swanſey, Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, and ſome other meetings, and to Rhode-iſland; tho' ſome of theſe meetings were hard and ſuffering times, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling weariſome, I was favoured with a ſhare of peace in my own boſom.</p>
               <p>AFTER a little ſtay at Newport, and ſome ſolid times among Friends, I took my leave and came to Kingſtown meeting, and then ſet forward, paſſing through Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut with Jacob Barney, who came with me as a guide, and was a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; we reached Mamarineck, and ſtaid a meeting, at which were two mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; from thence to Long-iſland, where I made but a ſhort ſtay, croſſed at the Narrows and Staten-iſland, and got to Woodbridge meeting on the firſt day of the week, and the next day arrived at my own habitation, in about one week from Newport, and to my great ſatisfaction, found my family well, through the good providence of the Almighty.</p>

to viſit the families of Friends in this city, and having a concern on my mind for the ſervice, I went to many places with my Uncle Chalkley, and other Friends, to good ſatisfaction. For ſome time I did not go any very diſtant journey, except once, as far as Weſt-river, in Maryland, to the Yearly-Meeting, in company with my Friend Robert Jordan; but I diligently attended meetings in this city, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe near it, both in Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey; which I did in much love, often chooſing to go on foot, having in my young years had many heavenly ſeaſons in that way of travelling.</p>

His third journey to New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note>IN the year 1744, it was on my mind to viſit again Friends in New-England, and having the unity of our Monthly-Meeting, and my Friend Abel James for a companion, he being a young man I much eſteemed; the latter end of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh Month, we proceeded pretty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to Long-iſland, where we viſited moſt of the meetings of Friends therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the favourable preſence and goodneſs of God being manifeſted in them,

gave me eaſe of mind,<note place="margin">New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> and united my heart to the faithful among them. When clear there, we went on the Main, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to Newport, on Rhode-iſland, where we were lovingly received among Friends, and after a ſhort ſtay, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Dartmouth, and were at a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there; and ſo forward through Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Lyn, and Salem, having meetings, in ſome of which I had ſatisfaction, and was glad to ſee Friends with whom I had ſome acquaintance in the beſt fellowſhip. The furtheſt place we went to in this journey was Salem; and were at ſeveral meetings on our return to Newport, which I hope tended to ſtir up the pure mind in ſome; altho' the life of religion appeared to be at a low ebb with many making a high profeſſion thereof. After ſeveral good opportunities among Friends at Newport, we returned homewards through Conecticut, making a ſhore ſtay to reſt at our Friend Thomas Franklin's, from whence we went to a meeting at New-town, on Long-iſland, then to New-York in company with ſeveral Friends, where we had a meeting, then proceeded home,

               <p>FROM the year 1745 to 1748, I kept much at home at our own meetings; yet went ſometimes to other meetings in Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey, as in the love of truth I was drawn forth to viſit them; the Lord having a choice people in theſe provinces who fear his name, and my heart was often, filled with endeared love to the upright hearted ſeed of God, from my firſt acquaintance among them; being at times baptized and united together in the one ſpirit and fellowſhip, which is not in the wiſdom of man, but from the power of God.</p>
               <p>MY dear wife being weakly in body, and had been in a poor ſtate of health for ſometime, departed this life in the fortieth

year of her age, on the firſt day of the ſecond month, 1748, and I have good reaſon to believe that ſhe is at reſt, having before her death, expreſſed that ſhe had made her peace with the Lord, and the evident tokens of his preſence in her ſickneſs, and at her latter end, much ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported my mind in ſo great a trial, and loſs of ſo good a wife and tender mother to my children, and one that loved the truth, and the ſervants of Chriſt, who lived an innocent life, being a pattern of plainneſs, a near companion, and true help-mate to me according to her capacity, both in things ſpiritual and temporal. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her death, in about a week, I buried my youngeſt ſon, and four ſons before the death of their dear mother; which were very near trials; but my greateſt help in theſe as well as many other afflictions that have fallen to my lot, has been to ſubmit to the bleſſed will of the Lord, who gives and takes away. Now having two daughters left, I was much concerned that the Almighty might be pleaſed to look in pity on them, as he did in mercy on me,

After we had attended meetings at Bridgetown, the Lord being with us, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled us by his mighty power to bear a faithful teſtimony, I truſt, to his eternal Truth, we went to Speightſtown, where we were favoured with ſome ſolid edifying meetings, tho' not ſo large as at Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town; we lodged at our eſteemed Friend Edward Harriſon's; we were alſo at the Spring meeting-houſe, where we lodged, a Friend living therein, and the next day had a meeting there, and in the afternoon at Bridgetown, which was large and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well.

<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012565_0051_0F8B15F2715C1BC0"/>
who was very kind to us; but my mind was much burthened and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed for that place and people, who are for the moſt part a wicked and ſinful ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; we had no meeting among them, there being no Friend on the iſland, except Friend Birket, and no openneſs, that I could find to ſatisfaction, for the teſtimony of truth to be declared, only we had ſome ſolid converſation with ſome. I came away much bowed in ſpirit for the ſins of the wicked in that iſland. From thence we went for Tortola, where we landed on the 28th of the ſeventh month, and met with ſeveral Friends in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that were glad to ſee us, at the houſe of our Friend John Pickering; where, and at our Friend William Thomas's, we lodged moſt of the time we were upon that iſland, they being truly kind and friendly to us; we were favoured with many good edifying meetings among Friends, there being two meeting-houſes on the iſland, viz. one at a place called Fat-hog bay, the other at the Road; we attended both of them with diligence, near the ſpace of ſix weeks, only that we

               <p>ON the ninth day of the ninth month, we left Tortola, in order to return to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigua, with deſign to get a paſſage for England; but being in a veſſel the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of which knew not how to manage her, we were going a contrary courſe, in which if we had proceeded, we might all have been loſt; we were much toſſed and driven about, and through perſuaſions, we prevailed with the captain to turn back, and he brought us to Santa Croix; but our going into the harbour called <hi>Lime-trees</hi> to drop anchor, ſeemed as if it would have proved fatal to us, there ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a veſſel armed with guns, from which we were fired at three times, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion had like to have been ſhot; it ſeems they had a deſign to have ſunk our veſſel, having heard there was a Spaniſh privateer on the coaſt, and the Governor had given orders to keep her off; they ſuſpected our's to be that veſſel; but our mariners being in a great fright, made

Praiſed and worſhipped be the name of God, that was nigh at hand, and a preſent help in the time of need! may I forever adore his great and eminent name, with all the true in heart, throughout all generations! he will not ſuffer thoſe to be confounded that truſt in him, and who deſire and endeavour faithfully to ſerve him. A particular caſe concerning pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateering, ſometime before I left home, now comes into my mind to mention. Some great men of our city being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fitting out veſſels for that wicked buſineſs, which having brought a deep engagement on my mind, it came upon me as a weighty duty, to go to one of theſe men, faithfully to warn him againſt this unrighteous way of getting riches; I got a Friend to accompany me, and I cleared my ſpirit of a heavy burden; he pleaded for the practice, but uſed me civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.—A new veſſel was fitted out ſometime after, called the <hi>Tartar,</hi> which was much

               <p>BUT to return to the place where we came to an anchor—My companion went on ſhore at Santa Croix, and would have had me gone with him, but my mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time much dejected, I choſe to ſtay on board the veſſel until next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when I went on ſhore, and met with my companion, who had agreed with a captain of a veſſel, bound for Spaniſh-town, near Tortola, for our paſſage thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we put our cheſts and other things on board this veſſel, then went on ſhore, and travelled acroſs the iſland on foot to Bas-end harbour, where the veſſel was to go, chooſing rather ſo to do, than to go round by water; in our walk we met with people that were kind to us; about noon
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012565_0055_0F8B15F76A62CCB0"/>
we called at a houſe and dined, and were entertained in a friendly manner; taking leave here, we went on towards Bas-end, ſtopping at another houſe ſome diſtance from the town for a drink of water, the people ſeeing we were ſtrangers, and being acquainted with Friends, kindly invited us in, to ſtay with them until the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel came round to the harbour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us that there was no houſe in the town ſuitable for us to be at, which I found afterwards was true, for they ſeemed to be a very wicked people. We ſtaid with theſe kind people two nights and part of two days, and on leaving them we would have ſatisfied them for the time we were there; but they would not take any thing for our entertainment, and ſeemed well pleaſed with our company; the man of the houſe attended us to the water ſide to ſee us embark on board the veſſel we had been waiting for, where he parted with us in a friendly manner: I waited a while on the ſhore for the Captain to go on board, there being a vendue, and a great number of people gathered to it, among them the Governor of the place, (being an iſland

                  <note place="margin">Tortola.</note>WE ſat ſail, and arrived at Tortola on the 15th of the ninth month. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſailors were a wicked company, took ſome of our things from us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded conſiderable more for our paſſage than we had agreed for, which we thought unreaſonable; but they ſaid we could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to pay, for that we were always go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about; we told them we had the more need to be ſaving of what we had; they hoiſted out the boat in an angry manner,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012565_0057_0F8B15F8E7AB9FD8"/>
and we paid them more than our paſſage to put us on ſhore; they firſt took uſe ſome diſtance from any houſe, and then landed us, which put us to the more difficulty what to do with our cheſts, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, that they might be ſafe; but being ſeen by one Iſaac Pickering (a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to our Friend John Pickering) he ſent his lad to aſk us to his houſe,<note place="margin">Tortola.</note> where we went, and he was ſo kind as to ſend for our things, and took care of them, and lent us horſes to go to his uncle's that night, where we were kindly received, and tenderly ſympathized with on the diſappointment and trouble, we had met with; they were dear and affectionate Friends to us on this iſland. We were at a meeting at Fat-hog bay, the 16th of the ninth month, and on the fourth day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, I was at one at the Road, both of them were good meetings. On the 23d of the month, I was taken ill of a fever at the houſe of our Friend Thomas Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys, and the next day my kind Friend John Pickering brought a man and horſe and took me to his houſe, where I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ill ſeveral weeks, and ſome of

the time I apprehended I ſhould lay down my life among them; but it was the bleſſed will of the Lord to reſtore me again to ſome degree of ſtrength, and I attended ſeveral meetings with Friends, wherein I had ſatisfaction, and on the 8th day of the eleventh month, I went to Gwan iſland, with our Friends James Parke and his wife, and ſtaid till the eleventh of the ſame, and after having a comfortable time in his family, I returned to Tortola, it being the meeting day at Fat-hog bay, and it proved to be a meeting to ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>AFTER a ſolid ſitting and parting with ſeveral at our Friend John Pickering's, on the 21ſt of this month, we went on board a veſſel bound to the iſland called St. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's (belonging to the Dutch) accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by our ſaid dear Friend,<note place="margin">Thomas's iſland.</note> and Thomas Humphreys, Jonas Lake, and Joſeph Ryan, and on the 22d landed there, and underſtood that the Captain of the ſhip, bound for Amſterdam, in which we were to take our paſſage, in order to get to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was very ill. We lodged at John

Demane's one night, and the next day went on board the veſſel, where we ſtaid moſtly till the laſt day of the month, and our dear Friends above-mentioned, after ſeeing us placed in the ſhip, parted with us in a tender, loving manner, and my heart was affected in parting with them: In the time we lay at anchor, the Captain died, and the chief mate, Robert Stewart, was appointed Captain in his ſtead, who was very kind to us in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtreſſes we met with on our paſſage.</p>
               <p>SOME days before we ſailed, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion was taken ſick, which ſo increaſed, that on the paſſage he ſeemed near unto death, which was a great trial and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to me, being myſelf weakly and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for we were companions in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but thro' the mercy of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he recovered.</p>
               <p>AFTER we had been three weeks and ſome days at ſea, a great ſtorm aroſe,<note place="margin">At ſea.</note> which appeared to be very dangerous, that in order to lighten the veſſel, the ſeamen threw out ſeveral weighty things; after

ſome weeks we got into ſoundings in the Engliſh channel, and were in hopes to be ſoon ſafe landed at ſome port in England; but another ſtorm aroſe, which drove us off to ſea, yet in eight days we again got ſoundings, but the wind being againſt us, we could not get forward to our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it rather ſuiting us to go to Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Captain altered his courſe for Kinſale harbour, as the veſſel wanted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs one of the Rudder-irons being broke, made it difficult to ſteer the veſſel, but by endeavours, they managed pretty well, and the day we made ſail for that land, we got in ſight of the harbour, but night coming on, and being fearful of rocks and ſhoals, they put off to ſea, and the weather being moderate the fore part of the night, the ſeamen were too careleſs and did not keep ſo ſtrict a watch as they ought; but the Captain, as he lay in his cabbin had ſo great an uneaſineſs on his mind, that he could not lay ſtill any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and went towards the head of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and found that inſtead of being out at ſea, we were near ſtriking on the land, whereupon he immediately awaked the

ſailors, and they tacked the veſſel about, and were very watchful until the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thus we eſcaped that danger;<note place="margin">In a ſtorm on the coaſt of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> in the morning it was very foggy, and a ſtorm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and we could not diſcover the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but were driven about for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, they threw over board one anchor; but the ſtorm continuing and the weather diſtreſſing, we were drove to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the land, and the ſeamen being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wearied out, apprehended we could not keep off much longer; thus we were in great diſtreſs, expecting the veſſel would be wrecked, and the Captain being much ſurpriſed, came to my companion and me, telling us he would do what he could to ſave our lives, for that we were in great danger of being loſt, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected we ſhould be drove on the ſhore in the night, if we kept off in the day, and was deſirous to know our minds, what he had beſt to do; whether to run the ſhip aground while we had day light, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our lives were ſpared, we could the better ſee how to help ourſelves; we not knowing what to adviſe him for the beſt, only to truſt in the good providence

<q>Now if you have it in your heart to return God thanks, I will join with you on my bare knees,</q>
and
<q>if it had not been for your prayers, we ſhould all have been loſt;</q>
but I aſcribed this great deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the kind mercy of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to us all; altho' I can truly ſay, my

ſoul was earneſt in ſupplication before the Lord at times on this trying paſſage, and at one particular ſeaſon, as I lay in my cabbin, not knowing but that we might be ſwallowed up in the mighty ocean, the ſpirit of prayer came on me, and I was raiſed on my knees to make interceſſion with the All-powerful Being, after which I went upon the deck, and the Captain ſeeing me, expreſſed in a very loving manner his unity and ſatisfaction, and I thought that the ſame good power and preſence which attended my mind, had ſome reach upon his heart.</p>
               <p>OH! in this trying paſſage, how often did my ſoul go down into many diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, but I was helped through all, to rely on God's mercy, and on a time I took the bleſſed Bible into my hands, and it was as if my eyes were call on that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the prophet Iſaiah, xliv. 1, 2, 3. where it is ſaid;
<q>Now hear, O Jacob my ſervant, and Iſrael whom I have choſen: Thus ſaith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob my ſervant, and

thou, Jeſurun, whom I have choſen; For I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine offspring.</q>
This gracious bleſſing of the Lord to his ſervants and choſen ones, was a comfort to me, and in his great condeſcenſion he fulfilled his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to help in the needful time.</p>

               <p>IT was on the 24th day of the firſt month, 1749, in the evening,<note place="margin">1749.

When this friendly man returned on ſhore, we went with him to his houſe, being an inn; where we were civilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, he took care of our cheſts and cloathing, and provided us with horſes, and a guid to conduct us to Cork, being about ten miles; when we got there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrangers, we were at a loſs to find our Friends; we alighted at a public-houſe, and went in and got ſome refreſhment; my companion inquired of a man in the houſe after our Friends in the town, who anſwered, that there were a great many of the brethren lived there; he was deſired to go to one of them, and inform him that we wanted to ſpeak with him; in a ſhort time he brought one of our Friends, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Richard Allen, at the ſight of whom I was well pleaſed, and he lovingly took us to his houſe, where ſoon after came A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham Fuller, and another Friend, who aſked for our certificates, which they read and were ſatisfied; our Friend A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham Fuller inviting us to his houſe, we went with him, and made it our home, while I ſtaid in Cork; we were favoured that evening with the company of ſeveral

Friends, which I eſteemed a great mercy from the Lord, that after being delivered from ſo many imminent dangers, we could be with ſo kind a people as they were to us;<note place="margin">At Cork.</note> the next day being the firſt of the week, I was at two meetings with Friends in that city, and my companion at one of them, which I hope will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered by both of us.</p>
               <p>BEING brought unexpectedly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially to this land, I much deſired that I might proceed aright in the courſe of my religious ſervice, for when on our paſſage, I expected to land in England, and meeting with many trials of my faith, and deep ſufferings in the Weſt-India iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, as alſo at ſea, I was ready to fear whether my preſent undertaking was from a right motion, or required of me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in, thinking that if I got ſafe to England, and ſaw ſome Friends there, and could meet with an opportunity to return home, whether I had not beſt ſo to do, not knowing that my lot would be caſt in Ireland; but Divine Wiſdom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering every thing that is conſiſtent with

and the diſcipline, made it a comfortable time to me, not having ſeen ſuch a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſince I left my native land, and the kindneſs and friendſhip that appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Friends at this meeting I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten remembred with comfort of mind, and the near unity I felt in my heart to a remnant among them, tended to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of my ſtrength and willingneſs to viſit Friends generally in that nation; and my journey being laid out by Friends, that I might proceed for the beſt, in reſpect to travelling, I went from my kind land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord's, Peter Judd, ſeveral miles to a meeting, and to Killconnor, and was at a meeting there, which altho' they were hard ſuffering times, I hope were of ſome ſervice to the ſolid minded; I had here a tendering time in the family of Samuel Watſon, his dear wife having viſited A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, I had ſeen her in my native land; ſhe was a worthy and ſerviceable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Lord's hand to many I believe where her lot was caſt; from hence I went to Carlow, where the meeting was to me laborious; then to John Lakes, Balitore, Athlone, and Mountmelick, ſome of which
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012565_0071_0F8B160739C3E720"/>
meetings were comfortable ſatisfactory ſeaſons; at Mountmelick, I lodged at Joſhua Strangman's, with whom I had great nearneſs in ſpirit, and thought him to be a hopeful young man in the way of truth, and my ſoul poſſeſſed ſweet peace under his roof; from hence I went to Ballinakill, Monntrath, Munderhead, and Roſegay, and had meetings, ſome of them being large and edifying ſeaſons, gave relief to the deep travel of my ſoul among them, the bleſſed power of Truth, which is the crown of our religious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, tenderly affecting our hearts before the Lord; I then went to Limerick, and was at their meeting in the morning and afternoon, to ſatisfaction; from thence to Jonathan Barnes, and was at a meeting at Killcommon-moor, the fore part of which was to me a time of great leanneſs and poverty of ſpirit, but before it ended, was I believe a time of tender viſitation to the people; and I was enabled through Divine Help, to declare the word of life among them; from thence I went to Burr, and was at a ſolid broken meeting, which was a comfortable ſeaſon; then to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam

Litſall's, and Ballymorin, and had meetings; ſo returned to Athlone, called the center of Ireland, and lodged at Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Sproul's, an antient loving Friend, who not only appeared to be, but I believe really was an example in the way of truth in that place, and had a laſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in my mind; from thence I went to the Moat, and Old Caſtle, at the laſt place there came to the meeting a prieſt, and a pretty many people, who behaved ſoberly, and I hope it was a good meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the next meeting was Ballahays, which was ſmall, and the comers to it ſeemed to be but indifferent profeſſors of the truth, which was cauſe of ſorrow to my heart; but having cleared myſelf, I proceeded to Coothill, and had a meeting to which ſeveral came, and behaved ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the next was Caſhelſhane, which was to ſatisfaction and comfort; from thence to Charlemont, which was a large meeting, and I had hard labour to diſcharge my duty among them; here came a man and woman, who had been troubleſome to Friends, in offering their intentions of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, who could not have unity with

their proceedings, he not being a member of our religious ſociety, and a diſorderly perſon, but at the concluſion of the meeting, they took each other as man and wife, which impoſition occaſioned the meeting to break up in diſorder; from hence I went to Ballyhagan, which was a a large and edifying meeting, and ſo to Colerain, Ballynacre, the Grange, and Antrim, and had meetings, which were moſtly hard ſuffering times, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to thoſe meetings, I was afraid were ſeveral of them but lifeleſs profeſſors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: I had the next meeting at Hilſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, at which were many Friends, and it tended to ſatisfaction; that ſame day I had a good meeting at Liſburn,<note place="margin">Belfaſt.</note> from thence I paſſed through Belfaſt to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, where came ſome who behaved rudely, and the meeting was not ſo well as could be deſired; the next was Ballene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derry, which was very large, and the Lord's good preſence being with us, the hearts of the faithful for his many mercies had cauſe to give thankſgivings and praiſes to his moſt worthy name; after this meeting I had a near parting time at

and there being a remnant of dear Friends in ſome part of that nation, I had comfort of mind, in going to ſee and viſit them in the love of God; and it being his bleſſed will to caſt my lot in that part of the world, I faithfully laboured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my duty in his fear, both to Friends and other people, that had freedom to come to our religious meetings, and ſeveral ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be reached by the power of truth, who did not make profeſſion among us.</p>

and kindly entertained; the next day being the firſt day of the week,<note place="margin">At White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven.</note> I was at two meetings with Friends at White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven, which I have often remembered. My way being laid out to viſit Friends in Cumberland, I went forward the 3d of the fifth month, on my way to Cocker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, and in travelling on the road my mind was much thoughtful, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I ſhould meet with any one to be a comfort to me, when not far from the town to which I was going, I met with two Friends, at firſt ſight I did not know either of them, but one of them ſpeaking to me, I found it to be Chriſtopher Wilſon, at which my heart was much rejoiced, he being a Friend who had travelled among us, in the work of the miniſtry in America, and I had ſeen in Philadelphia; the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which I intended, not being to be held till the next day, I turned back with him to his houſe; where we had near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation together in the love of truth; the next day he accompanied me to the meeting appointed, which was a ſolid time; the day following I went to Jzel, and had a meeting with the few Friends
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012565_0077_0F8B160DE99F4DD0"/>
there, and altho' ſmall it was a ſolid meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; after that, I was at Pardſaw-hall, which was a good meeting, ſo to Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and had comfort of mind among Friends thereaway. I then returned to Pardſaw-hall again, and on the firſt day of the week the meeting was very large, and the good preſence of God attending the ſame, made it an humbling comfortable ſeaſon; the ſame day I was at a large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, near Chriſtopher Wilſon's, which ended well; from thence was at Keſwick, tho' ſmall a good meeting, ſo to Moſdale and had a large ſatisfactory meeting, alſo at Colbeck, Bolton, and Wigton, ſome of which were large, and I hope tended to edification and comfort; from thence I went to Allanby, and Holm, and had large meetings, in which the power of truth prevailed in a good degree, the next was at Kirkbride, in which I had hard ſervice, and a cloſe teſtimony to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in the way of truth, which I left to their conſideration; from thence I went to Jonathan Aſtell's, who and his wife were choice antient Friends, my ſtay at their houſe, and being with ſuch
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012565_0078_0F8B160ED7B41D80"/>
dear Friends, afforded me at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed comfort of mind; for altho' the Lord was gracious in ſome places power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to aſſiſt my poor ſpirit to diſcharge my duty, yet at times I met with cloſe ſufferings and bemoanings, for the ariſing of the Divine Spring of life, both in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others; I went to Carliſle from thence, and ſo back to Moor-houſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then to Scotby, Kirklington, and a meeting that John Irwen and his wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to, who were both antient Friends, and I believe had been of ſervice in the work of the miniſtry; and altho' ſome of thoſe meetings were trying times, and attended with hard labour, I truſt that I was clear in the ſight of God in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to be faithful to what I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to be my duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.</note>FROM Cumberland, I went into Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, and the firſt meeting I was at, was Cuthbert Wigham's, where was a conſiderable number of newly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Friends, which was a comfortable and contrited meeting before the Lord; from thence I went to Weſt-Allandale, to a large
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012565_0079_0F8B160F6682B808"/>
meeting, which was powerfully reached with the ſenſe of the love of God; the next meeting was at Alſton-moor, which tho' not very large, I hope might tend to the benefit of ſome; then Penrith, Terril, and Strickland meetings, ſome of which were to ſatisfaction, and I met with a kind reception, and had near unity with many dear Friends in divers places.</p>
               <p>FROM Strickland, I went to Kendal, in Weſtmoreland,<note place="margin">Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland.</note> to my dear Friend John Crowdſon's, where I ſtaid ſome days and reſted as to travelling; but attended pretty many meetings in Kendal, to which belonged many worthy Friends, who were extraordinary kind and friendly, which I eſteemed a favour, yet at that time, I was in a very low ſituation of mind, much overwhelmed with many inward ſorrows, and conflicts of ſoul; but was intent to do the beſt I could to get through what might fall to my lot at ſo great a diſtance from my outward habitation, truſting in the Almighty hand of the Lord, who alone know my diſtreſſed condition, and to whom I put forth my cries and ſecret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes

for relief; <hi>dominion and everlaſting praiſe be rendered to him for evermore!</hi> in the courſe of what he was pleaſed to lay upon my mind to ſay in meetings by way of teſtimony, he was alſo pleated to be gracious in appearing to open my way in the cauſe I had at heart, which was the promotion of welldoing, and the good of mankind here and hereafter; at this place meetings were large, and I hope bleſſed with the notice of heaven; to this meeting belonged Margaret Coupland,<note place="margin">Kendal.</note> who had viſited our parts, was an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary ſolid Friend, and retained the lively ſenſe of truth; while I was here, I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter from my kind Friend Iſrael Pemberton the younger, giving me ſome account of my dear children and Friends at home, which was very acceptable to me; this dear Friend's worthy father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bright pattern and elder in the church of Chriſt, given to hoſpitality and good works, the near unity I had with him in ſpirit gave me much comfort and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, as he was brought frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my remembrance in this journey. On account of my children, I had been
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012565_0081_0F8B16145D70F108"/>
often concerned, and dropped many tears for their everlaſting welfare, they being very near to my life; Oh how I much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that they might chooſe the Lord for their portion, and the God of Jacob, his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for the lot of their inheritance! then I truſted that he would be pleaſed to be a ſure Friend to them as they kept in his holy fear and council.</p>
               <p>FROM Kendal I went to Grayrig, which was a ſolid tender broken meeting, alſo to Preſton Patrick, Windermere, and Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which meetings were to ſatisfaction, and ended well; from thence to Hight meeting, in Lancaſhire, which afforded ſome comfort to my mind, the next was at Swarth-moor-hall,<note place="margin">Lancaſhire.</note> where George Fox belonged in his time, which was a large and a good meeting, from thence I went to Lancaſter, and was at two meetings on the firſt day of the week, which were large and comfortable, here lived Lydia Lancaſter, and Elizabeth Rawlinſon, both worthy Friends who had viſited America, and in one of thoſe meetings, they both appeared in a living teſtimony for the

Lord in their advanced age, and it did me good to perceive that they were alive in the root of life; at this meeting was William Thomas, a miniſtring Friend from Tortola, lately landed; I went that day home with William Backhouſe, a Friend who had viſited America in the work of the miniſtry, he received me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kindly and lovingly in his houſe; the next day I was at Yellan meeting, which was to ſatisfaction; then to Bentham, which was a large meeting, and attended with the ſolid power of truth, from thence to Dent, in which meeting the ſpring of life was opened among us, to the comfort of the ſincere in heart, to this meeting belonged John Burton, who had viſited our parts, a dear Friend I was glad to ſee, having ſeen him in my native land; the next meetings were Brigflats, and Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtondale, which I hope tended to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to the laſt belonged Alice Alderſon, a worthy inſtrument, who had travelled in America on the Lord's errand, and was truly acceptable in her religious viſit; from thence I went to Griſedale, and was at a large living meeting, the next was at
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012565_0083_0F8B161568E42B90"/>
Counterſet, which was large and ſolid; from thence I went to Swale-dale, Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garth, Richmond, and another meeting in my way to Raby, ſome of which meetings were ſatisfactory ſolid ſeaſons; at Raby, I met with ſeveral worthy Friends, who I found in converſation to be true help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to me, particularly James Wilſon and Joſeph Taylor; I had ſeen Joſeph in Philadelphia, when on his religious viſit to our country, and it was a pleaſure and comfort now to ſee him in his own habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; from this place, I went to Biſhop-Auckland, Durham, Benfieldſide,<note place="margin">Durham county.</note> and New-Caſtle upon Tyne, which meetings were moſtly hard laborious times to my baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit; then to Shields, Sunderland, Shotton, and Darlington, the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with Friends thereaway, being moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfortable; after theſe meetings I went to Stockton, Giſborough, Yalton, and Caſtletown, where I had meetings, ſome of which were to ſatisfaction; after this I went to that dear antient Friend, John Richardſon's, he had been twice to America on religious viſits, and had taken much pains in his day and time, for the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012565_0084_0F8B16163200A0F0"/>
ſpreading and promoting the goſpel of peace and ſalvation in the earth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he was antient and feeble in body, he was freſh and green in the life of religion, and my heart was refreſhed, in the unity and fellowſhip of Divine life, in being in his company; I lodged here, and the next day went to the meeting at Kirby-moor-ſide, to which he belonged, which was a ſolid good meeting, from hence to Ampwelford, Rilſdale, Thirſk and Kirby, ſome of which were weighty ſolid meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the humble in heart were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trited therein; then to the (Quarterly-Meeting at York,<note place="margin">Yorkſhire.</note> which held ſeveral days for worſhip and the diſcipline of the church, was very large and attended by many ſolid Friends from their particular meetings, near unity and goſpel fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip being in a good degree manifeſted, this opportunity begat an agreeable acquaintance with many Friends whom I afterwards found to be very friendly and kind to me, as I went forward on my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. From this city I went to Thornton, Molton, Pickering, Withy, Stanton, Scarborough, and was at meetings, ſeveral
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012565_0085_0F8B16174BA89E80"/>
of them being large, and edifying;—I was next at Bridlington, to which meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came a pretty many people, but it was a time of hard labour, this meeting being declined from what it had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, according to the account I had of it, and the few Friends left, did not live in that unity I could have been glad to have found among them; to this meeting once belonged Margaret Langdale, who came to Philadelphia, and was afterwards the wife of our worthy Friend Samuel Preſton, late of that city, her labours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Friends in the work of the miniſtry were of great ſervice in her time.</p>
               <p>FROM Bridlington I came to Hornſey, and to two other places, and ſo to Hull, having meetings, ſome of which were large, being attended both by Friends and other people, and the Divine Preſence of the Almighty being over all, they ended to good ſatisfaction. From Hull I went to a meeting in my way to Cave-holden, Pontifract, Rawcliff, and Thorn, to which meetings I travelled in great affliction of body, and much conflict of ſpirit, on
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012565_0086_0F8B1617EB1BA500"/>
account of great beſetments that fell to my lot in the courſe of my travels, and the work and warfare that I honeſtly laboured in, having left all that was near and dear to me as a creature, on account of the bleſſed truth; that had not the All-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aid helped me, to look to him in whom everlaſting ſtrength is, I had faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but dominion and praiſe to him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his ſtrength was made perfect in my great weakneſs! and in thoſe meetings I was enabled to bear a teſtimony to his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty name, altho' out of meetings greatly beſet; yet keeping my confidence in God, he was pleaſed in his great mercy to caſt up a way for my help and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance!</p>
               <p>FROM Thorn, I went to my dear Friend Joſeph Atkinſon's at Rawcliff, who and his wife were as tender towards me as if I had been one of their own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; after ſome ſtay with theſe my loving Friends, I got better in health, and the motion of life and love increaſing in my heart to viſit the churches, I proceeded, and went to Thorn meeting, which was
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012565_0087_0F8B1619FB8CB0A0"/>
an edifying good time; here I met with my Friend John Fiſher, who accompanied me to ſeveral places, having before tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled moſtly alone, both in England and Ireland, as to a conſtant companion;— we had two meetings in our way to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Payne's, where we had a meeting, and at Hanſworth-Woodhouſe, to which laſt belonged John Haſlam, a dear Friend who had been very acceptable in his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious viſit to Friends in America, and had viſited the churches to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the faithful; his agreeable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at his own houſe, renewed our freſh unity in pure and laſting fellowſhip in the goſpel of peace; from thence we went to Sheffield, where we had two large good meetings; the next was Burton, which was large and a comfortable time; the next meeting was at Wakefield, where came a pretty many people, in which I was ſilent, as it ſo fell out at ſeveral places in meetings appointed, which I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, if rightly minded, might be a means to bring people to hearken to the alone teacher in their own hearts, for it is there the word of faith is to be obeyed;

and altho' the dependance of the outward ear ſometimes may be upon the ſervants of Chriſt; yet they cannot ſpeak aright, and to the witneſs in the conſciences of men, but as he is pleaſed by his ſpirit to give them utterance; the deſign and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of all true goſpel miniſtry, which ſprings from the Divine Word of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtir up the pure mind to adhere to the holy teaching of Chriſt in their own ſouls.</p>
               <p>THE next meeting was at Gilderſham, which was a ſolid good opportunity, and dearly united my ſpirit to ſome who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſame; from hence I went to Leeds, and was at two large meetings on the firſt day, and at a week day meeting, ſome of which, I hope tended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote true ſpiritual worſhip to God; from hence we went to Waldale, Brighouſe, and Rawden, and had meetings which were large ſolid and comfortable; the next was at Bradford, to which came a pretty many people, and it ended well; we lodged at Benjamin Bartlett's, where we met with Edmund Peckover, Jane Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:012565_0089_0F8B161C784BF8D8"/>
and May Drumond; my worthy Friend Edmund, having left great ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the minds of many in America, and on mine in particular, it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to me to ſee him again.</p>
               <p>FROM hence we went to Halifax, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by William Longmier, a dear brother and fellow helper in the goſpel, who had been with us to ſeveral meetings before, and was choice company, and did me much good; the meeting at Halifax was large, and ended I hope to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Truth: here I parted with my companion, John Fiſher, and went to five diſtant places, having meetings in my way to Skipton, ſome of which were large, being attended both by Friends and other people, and I believe to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: I had a good time at the meeting at Skipton, and with the ſchollars of my Friend David Hall at his ſchool, having near unity with his company, I lodged here one night, and went from thence to Lowtherdale, where William and Mary Slater belonged, who were ſerviceable Friends in the work of the miniſtry; this
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012565_0090_0F8B161D2EEAE8F8"/>
meeting was large and eminently affected with the ſenſe of Divine Life and Power; the next meetings were Ayrton, Settle, and Newton, which were moſtly ſolid and ſatisfactory; the next was Narſedale, which was ſmall, and I was fearful very cold profeſſors of the right way of worſhip in this I was ſilent; from thence I went to the Fiel, Proud-Preſton, Longridge, and Elmaridge, and had meetings, which tho' moſtly ſmall were pretty ſatisfactory; the meetings following were Sowledale, Trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Marſden, and Trodmarden, and at another place, which were generally large and edifying. I went next to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Holdham, Mancheſter, Langtree, Aſton, Bickerſtaff, and Liverpool, ſome of which were pretty large and ſolidly comfortable;<note place="margin">Lancaſhire.</note> from Liverpool I went to Pankith, Warrington, and Framby, which meetings were large and uniting ſeaſons to the honeſt hearted; at the laſt place I was much relieved and ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thro' the dominion of the Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that attended; from this place came Eſther Clare to Pennſylvania, a Friend of the miniſtry, a member of our meeting in

Philadelphia, who was divinely endowed and inſpired with a knowledge in the things of God's kingdom, and was a helpful inſtrument in the hand of the Lord to me in my young years:—The next meetings were Sutton, Newton, and John Downs in Cheſhire, to ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; from thence I went to Cheſter, and to Rixham in Wales, which were hard ſmall meetings, and dull as to the life of religion; then returning into Cheſhire,<note place="margin">Cheſhire.</note> to Namptwich, and Middlewitch, had meetings which were comfortable ſeaſons: I then went to the houſe of a Friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Morley, where I reſted ſome days as to travelling; during my ſtay here I viſited the ſick, and ſome Friends fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Morley meeting which was large, and the good preſence of the Lord attending, made it a good meeting; from thence I went to Stockport, Maxfield, and Leek, ſome of which meetings were large and to ſatisfaction; the laſt place was in Staffordſhire, in my way from Joſhua Tofft's to Stafford I had a meeting;<note place="margin">Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> as likewiſe in that town, which was ſmall, and the life of truth appearing at a low

ebb among them, was cauſe of ſorrow and ſuffering to my mind; the next meeting was at Birmingham, which was pretty large, and I hope of ſervice to ſome who were there;—from thence I went to Coventry,<note place="margin">Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> and lodged at my kinſman's John Newman, his wife being my wife's firſt couſin, they were exemplary Friends truly kind and loving, and a comfort to me in meeting with them at their own houſe; here I heard of the death of my dear aunt Martha Chalkley, from a Friend living at this place, the account of which much affected my ſpirit for the loſs of ſo near a relation and dear Friend, whom I much loved and eſteemed, ſhe being one who feared the Lord, and was ſerviceable to Friends where ſhe lived in her time.</p>
               <p>AT Coventry I was at two large meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, one of which was much crowded by reaſon of a funeral, and both were ſolid opportunities with the people; from hence I went tp Badgley, and another place ſome diſtance, and was at two ſolid meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; the next were at Warwick, and Eatington, from whence I went to Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,

in Worceſterſhire, and was at two large meetings to edification, from thence to Longcompton, Radway,<note place="margin">Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> and Harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, ſome of which meetings were large and ſolid; at the laſt place I was told, that the people when they heard of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intended, ſaid they would come to ſee the Outlandiſh man, and many came who behaved ſoberly, and Divine Life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed that day among us to the comfort of my mind; from thence I went forward to two meetings in my way to Worceſter, at diſtant places; at Worceſter the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were large and ſolid, and tho' ſome profeſſors appeared to be gone out from the way of the ſelf denying life, into much liberty and extravagance, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was a time of viſitation to their ſouls; from this city I went to Bewdley, Bromſgrove, Sturbridge, Dudley, and Colebrookdale, at which places I had meetings, moſtly pretty large, ſolid, and edifying; the next place I went to was Shrewſbury, where,<note place="margin">Shropſhire.</note> in company with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Friends, I viſited two dear Friends that were in priſon on account of tithes, and our hearts being tendered together, we had to

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Wales.</note>FROM hence I went into Wales, with John Fowler, a ſolid young man, who tho' not a public miniſter, came out of Warwickſhire on purpoſe to accompany me; our firſt meeting was at Dolobran in Montgomeryſhire, which was ſmall and poor; then we came to Ellis Lewis's where we had a meeting with a few plain kind Friends, and at Twinde, in Merrioneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where were only three Friends to keep up the meeting; but it afforded much comfort to my mind, that I had an opportunity to ſee them, with whom we had a ſolid time; the next meeting was at John Goodwin's in the ſame County, a brave worthy man, who had been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to bring ſeveral to the knowledge of the truth thereaway, and where is a large meeting, in which it gave me ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in being among them; from thence we went to Talcot, and ſo into Radnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire in South Wales, where we had two

In my way from my dear Friend John Lewis's to Swanzey, I had two diſtant meetings, one of which was large and moſtly people who did not profeſs with us, and I hope was of good ſervice, the life and power of the Divine Word bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the minds of the people into ſtillneſs, the meeting ended well.—I was at two meetings at Swanzey, the firſt ſmall and ſilent, the other a large open time; from thence we came to John Bevan's, where we had a ſmall hard meeting, then at Pontypool, where the meeting was pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large and I hope ended well; we had

alſo an evening meeting at a Friends houſe, which was a comfortable time; and one at Shirenewton, not very large, but a good meeting, this being the laſt in Wales; having viſited all the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in that country that could be called by our name, as near as I remember, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Pedſtown, and ſome of that meeting were at Haverford-weſt; when I had got there, I had great cauſe to be humbly thankful to my kind Lord and Maſter, for his Divine Help and merciful preſervation thro' much toilſome travel both of body and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>FROM thence I went to Roſs in Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire, and on my way parted with my companion John Fowler, his deſire being to return home after this journey; at Roſs I had a comfortable meeting, and went forward to Hamler, Leominſter, and Bromyard,<note place="margin">Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> having meetings; the two firſt were ſolid good opportunities, and at Leominſter, it was large and ſome hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful newly convinced Friends were there; the other was almoſt lifeleſs as to a true zeal for Divine Worſhip, and but little

at Banbury I was favoured with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of my Friend Benjamin Kidd,<note place="margin">1750.</note> who I had formerly ſeen in Philadelphia, when a lad, and was a comfort to me when I was in a reverent ſearch after the things of God's kingdom; the friendſhip of this dear Friend at his houſe, was alſo now an encouragement to me in the way of my religious Service.</p>
               <p>FROM hence I went forward into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral counties, and was at a number of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in different places, which I hope were of profit to the people, and in ſome places they were large; at two of them I had the company of my beloved Friends Catharine Payton and Rachel Wilſon, they being in their way to the Yearly-Meeting at London;<note place="margin">Berkſhire.</note> we went forward together to Reading, where I met with my dear wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friend Samuel Hopwood, with whom when in Pennſylvania, I had travelled to ſome places, and I believe was now glad of our meeting to ſee each other again; he was a zealous and fervent labourer in the Lord's vineyard, who I believe had bleſſed his labours to many ſouls; we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

at Reading to ſweet ſatisfaction; from thence we all went to Maidenhead, and was at a meeting there, in which I was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; from this town we went to London together,<note place="margin">London.</note> and on our way ſeveral Friends met us; our Friend John Hunt being one of them, would have me to his houſe, and gave me a kind reception, where I made my home for the moſt part during the times my lot was caſt in that great city.</p>
               <p>THE Yearly-Meeting was large, and I hope edifying to many honeſt travellers in Sion's way.</p>
               <p>WHEN this meeting was over, I went for Scotland, finding my mind drawn forth in much love to Friends in thoſe parts,<note place="margin">Scotland.</note> as I had after I firſt landed in England; but thro' ſome diſcouragement in myſelf, omitted the opportunity of going there when I was in Cumberland, near the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it, which cauſed me much more travelling to get to ſee Friends thereaway; but in regard to peace of mind, which is to be valued above all the world, I now gave up to perform this viſit.</p>

the county of Somerſet; I went into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire and Cornwal, having the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my dearly beloved friend John Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to whoſe ſpirit I was nearly united in the love of truth, and was a great comfort and help to me in my weak condition, at his uncle's.—I would juſt remark that in ſome of the counties in which I had been, ſome dear young people, who were libertine in the ſhew of pride and finery of the world, became ſober, ſolid and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary, and one young woman in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular was ſo reached, as I ſat in a Friend's houſe, tho' I had nothing by way of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in words to her condition, yet the weight and exerciſe attending my mind at that time, ſo reached her underſtanding, ſhe became a plain ſolid Friend, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I left England, I heared her in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry at a meeting, and as I thought, to the general ſatisfaction of Friends preſent;— I was at Exeter meeting in Devonſhire, and had a weighty ſolid time among Friends there,<note place="margin">Devonſhire.</note> although I was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the converſation of one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the truth, that pleaded for carnal defence, and aſked what defence we had

in the province of Pennſylvania; I told him that Providence was our defence; yet he continued to plead for carnal defence in ſuch a manner, that gave me much pain of mind, and I told him that I had no unity with his principles, and bore my teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt his unprofitable diſcourſe.—I went to ſeveral meetings in my way to Kingſbridge, where I had a ſolid meeting; from thence took a number of meetings; in my way to Auſtil in Cornwal,<note place="margin">Cornwal.</note> ſome of which were to ſatisfaction, and I hope of ſome ſervice to the right minded; after a weighty good meeting at Auſtil, I came to Falmouth, and had a meeting in which I hope I was clear as to my duty amongſt them; then accompanied by my dear Friend Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Hopwood, I went to Penzance, and many other meetings in theſe counties; from this place, where we had I hope a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable meeting, I returned, taking ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meetings in my way to Bridport in Dorſetſhire;<note place="margin">Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note> we had two meetings in this town, the laſt of which was large, the people being told of an Indian, as I had come from America, I believe it raiſed a curioſity among them, for a large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

came to the meeting, and as they came in looked on me and one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Dorſetſhire.</note> but after a while behaved in a ſober manner, and my dear Lord and Maſter favoured the opportunity I hope to the comfort of many, and when the meeting ended the people departed with quietneſs and ſobriety; for which I had cauſe to be truly thankful, being much concerned how we ſhould fare that day, ſo as not to occaſion any blame to the good cauſe I have ſincerely laboured to promote from my youth, humbly deſiring that my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours altho' weak, might tend to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the ſame.</p>
               <p>AFTER having a pleaſing time much to my comfort, with my loving kind Friend Samuel Bownas, who had viſited America in the work of the miniſtry twice, I proceeded to ſeveral meetings in my way to Weymouth and Pool, where I alſo had meetings, ſome of which were ſolid times; then taking ſeveral meetings in my way to Southampton, I had there a ſmall meeting; then paſſed over to Cowes on the Iſle-of-Wight, and after viſiting Friends there,

               <p>AFTER I had thus viſited London, I went to a conſiderable number of meetings in places ſome diſtance from thence, ſome of which were large weighty ſolid oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; my beloved Friend John Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton, whoſe company was acceptable, being with me at ſeveral of them.</p>

when we came there, our dear Friends left us, I believe in true love, my ſpirit nearly and affectionately parting with them; Edward Cathrall of Philadelphia, was paſſenger with me in this veſſel, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier Dean being commander; we ſat ſail and came away as ſoon as we could from Graveſend, and after a paſſage of about eleven weeks, landed at New-York on the 10th day of the ſeventh month, 1751 old ſtyle, and on the 13th of the ſame month we got home to our habitations,<note place="margin">Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> being the day before our Yearly-Meeting in this city. Which was through the great preſervation of the Almighty, who was, and is a God nigh at hand, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and preſerved me in great probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conflicts of ſoul, beyond my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſet forth in words; but I think it my duty to ſay, <hi>Good is the Lord and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy to be feared, praiſed, loved, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, worſhipped, and obeyed!</hi> his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, mercy and grace have been eminent for my preſervation and ſalvation, that he would not ſuffer me to be confounded, altho' he was pleaſed to permit great prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to befall me, both in my paſſage home

Friends belonging to Cheſter meeting,<note place="margin">1768.</note> a branch of Eveſham Monthly-Meeting, which I performed in the twelfth month, 1768,<note place="margin">New-Jerſey.</note> in much love, faithfully labouring both in the families where I went with my couſin John Lippincot and wife, Edmund Hollinſhead, and John Roberts, alſo in the ſeveral public meetings, which were large, and chiefly in Burlington county, being eight in number, beſides one with the Indians at Edgepelick (or Brotherton) where Divine Strength was afforded to proclaim the council and will of God through Chriſt, as I apprehended, and in the performance of this labour of love, I enjoyed great comfort of mind, and near unity with Friends, my viſits to whoſe families were generally opportunities of kind reception, and ſuch openneſs and brokenneſs of heart in many places, that it beſpoke a day of viſitation of God's love to their ſouls, and I wiſh it may be
<q>as bread caſt on the waters, that may be found after many days.</q>
Having performed this labour of love, I viſited ſeveral meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this province and New-Jerſey, and attended the burials of ſome valuable
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:012565_0181_0F8B15AF80728080"/>
Friends at diſtant places, ſome of which opportunities were much to my ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſolid comfort, as were the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and profitable ſeaſons at home, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I had to enjoy at times the Lord's liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſence in the beſt of ſtrength, and Divine liberty that is in the goſpel, with my dear Friends of our own meeting.</p>
               <p>AFTER this I found drawings in my mind of love towards Friends at Long-iſland and thereaway,<note place="margin">1769.</note> and having the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and unity or my dear Friends at our Monthly-Meeting, in the eighth month, 1769, I went forward, ſome Friends accompanying me; the firſt night I lodged at Robert Colliſon's,<note place="margin">Bucks county.</note> and the next day attended the Quarterly-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Falls in Bucks county, where was Rachel Wilſon from England, and a very large meeting, and I hope a time of profit to many; I was alſo at their youth's meeting the next day, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably attended with the love of God, and with near unity with Friends; after meeting dined at Mahlon Kirkbride's, then rode through Delaware ford, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

that day Samuel Worth's, and the next Joſeph Shotwell's,<note place="margin">New-Jerſey.</note> and the day following being the firſt of the week, was at two meetings at Rahway, with our Friend Samuel Emlen jun. to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſatisfaction, then went with him and ſeveral other Friends to New-York,<note place="margin">New-York.</note> and engaged with him in viſiting the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of Friends in that city, which we performed to about forty families, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their Monthly-Meeting to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of comfort, and had ſeveral open times in places, wherein I hope the Lord's precious ſeed was watered through his bleſſed preſence; my mind was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of a burden that had lain upon me, and having met with a kind reception among Friends there, I went from thence to Weſtbury on Long-iſland,<note place="margin">Long-iſland.</note> where we had a large meeting on the firſt day of the week, which was favoured with Divine help, living comfort and near unity with Friends, where came my kind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion Joſhua Creſſon, who I had left at Rahway when on our way to New-York; after this meeting viſited ſome Friends families, and the next day were at a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,

and the day following at the youth's meeting in the ſame place,<note place="margin">Long-iſland.</note> from whence we went to Matinicock, and Oyſter-bay, where were two large meetings to good ſatisfaction, and on our way to John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis's, we called with ſeveral Friends to ſee Clement Willis, who as I have already mentioned, had been confined through infirmity of body between thirty and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, and could not walk or ſtand alone, as I apprehend, moſt of that time; we were owned together in waiting upon the Lord by his living preſence, and the dear afflicted Friend expreſſed, that ſhe did not know that ſhe ever had a more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory time, and I hope it was a ſeaſon of profit to ſeveral of us then preſent; on the firſt day following we were again at Weſtbury meeting, which was large, and I hope they were faithfully warned in goſpel love, to the ſatisfaction of Friends; from Long-iſland we croſſed over the Sound into Conecticut,<note place="margin">Conecticut.</note> to a place called Middleſex, in company with Matthew Franklin, John Wells, John Cock, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Symonds and ſome others, diſtance about twenty miles by water, where was

               <p>IN a meaſure of the ſame love that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended my mind when preſent in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy among you, I take this freedom now to ſalute you in ſpirit, wiſhing the health and proſperity of the precious truth in every particular branch thereof; we as a people profeſs it to lead us into all truth, which is the greateſt profeſſion in the world, and is the moſt ſure and ſafe for all the truly living and acting members of the myſtical body and church of Chriſt,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:012565_0191_0F8B15B9308D90C0"/>
to be guided by the wiſdom and nature of it in all things, to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>AND dear Friends, keep in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wiſdom and love of God, for
<q>God is love, and Chriſt hath commanded us to love one another,</q>
as alſo one of his ſervant's adviſeth to love as brethren; let nothing break the unity that is in the true faith and peaceable ſpirit of Chriſt our holy head; but dear brethren; be of one mind in his righteous cauſe, in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner in maintaining decency and good order in his church, that his church may be built and ſupported by living ſtones, and his vineyard kept clean and thriving with living branches, ſuch that may bring forth much good fruit to the praiſe of God!—My ſpirit according to my meaſure is often with ſuch among you, that have the weight of the Lord's work on your ſhoulders, and I have many times been comforted in remembring the refreſhing and edifying ſeaſons of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and preſence of Chriſt that we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed together, in that ability he was pleaſed to afford unto us, when it was my
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:012565_0192_0F8B15B9EF4E4678"/>
lot to be in your parts; and I thought myſelf to be in a good degree clear as to my religious duty, only with reſpect to the meeting for buſineſs, it gave me ſome pain of mind, that there was no diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made betwen ſuch that were of our own family (Friends in unity) and thoſe of other perſuaſions, by allowing them the ſame privilege with Friends, in ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe meetings, to ſee and obſerve the remarks on your own proper buſineſs, and they having no proper right as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the ſociety, it muſt needs weaken the teſtimony, and the right labour of faithful Friends, and expoſe the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch meetings to the vain and libertine converſation of the world, and ſo cauſe the way of Truth to be evily ſpoken of, as alſo give great pain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to the ſincere-hearted.</p>
               <p>IT is in much love and tenderneſs, that I have thus expreſſed myſelf in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and to eaſe the weight that has been on my mind, from a thought of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual cuſtom, not allowed among Friends in other places where the authority of
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:012565_0193_0F8B15BAA75F0A60"/>
Truth takes place; I wiſh it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed among you ſo as to have it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which I believe will be more to the advantage of the church among yourſelves, and greater ſatisfaction to the Lord's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that may come to viſit you in goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel love; it had been better for me, I have thought, had I embraced the opportunity to have eaſed my ſpirit when we were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but a backwardneſs prevented which I had rather had not happened; but if this is received in the ſame love that it is intended, I hope it may anſwer the ſame good deſign.</p>
               <p>I DO not in the leaſt deſire by what I have mentioned, that any diſreſpect be ſhewn to thoſe of other religious denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or to prevent their coming to our meetings for worſhip, or any chriſtian office of love in any ſuitable way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo that it be conſiſtent with our holy profeſſion, but with reſpect to what I have hinted, I have thought it an impoſition and diſorderly in ſuch to expect any ſuch privilege, and I wiſh that Elders may exert their authority, ſuch that the Holy

Ghoſt may make overſeers, and that they may be preſerved, ſo as to look well to themſelves, and to the flock of Chriſt, and that the ſame powerful faith that hath been the foundation of the righteous in all ages, may be their ſtrength and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſo as to rule well, and to be worthy of double honour, they labouring and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during in the ſpirit of love and meekneſs, to do the Lord's work with pure hearts and clean hands, ſeeking that honour that comes from God only, that he may be pleaſed to fulfil his gracious promiſe, to honour thoſe that honour him, that by their being good examples to the flock, the youth and all that go under our name, may follow them as they follow Chriſt, and my heart is tenderly affected before the Lord on account of the riſing youth, who are coming upon the ſtage of life, and are reached I believe, many of them, by the ſame good ſhepherd's voice that viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many of us, by the powerful call of grace and faith to ſalvation, that they may daily partake of heavenly bread, and nouriſhment to their ſouls, ſo as to grow ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:012565_0195_0F8B15BEE255B7F8"/>
his might, and they kept faithful to Divine Knowledge and the bleſſed yoke of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo as to live in the fear of God, and proſper in thoſe things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Truth's teſtimony, obedience to parents, true moderation, plainneſs of ſpeech and apparel, and out of the vain converſation of the ungodly; for the ways of the ungodly ſhall periſh.—And let all the tribulated and faithful followers of the Lamb, be encouraged to keep your heavenly places in Chriſt, for he hath told us, that
<q>Greater is he that is in you, than they that are in the world,</q>
and let none
<q>be weary in welldoing, for in due time we ſhall reap if we faint not.</q>

               <p>IN true and brotherly love, I take this opportunity to ſalute you, having been deſirous according to my meaſure, that the Lord's glorious work and truth may proſper in your parts, and prevail to the glory and honour of his moſt excellent name and praiſe, that hath planted a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of families, not many years ſince in that wilderneſs, with a deſign I truſt, that he might have a fruitful field or garden, yielding pleaſant fruits, and be a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to him.</p>
               <p>And dear Friends;</p>
               <p>LET the awful ſenſe of the great care and tender mercy, and good Providence of God towards his flock and family be thankfully remembred, ſo as to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his grace and goodneſs towards

you; and let the love of God in Chriſt prevail in your hearts, and brotherly love one towards another in the unity of the ſpirit, which is the bond of peace; that there may be no hurting or deſtroying in all the Lord's holy mountain; but a care that you may be preſerved in the faith and fellowſhip of the ſaints in light, that you may be as lights and way-marks to others, ruling well in your places and ſtations in the church of Chriſt, in the meekneſs and patience, humility and charity, as becomes the followers of the Lamb, looking to him, the true guide of his flock, to be led in and out that you may find paſture, and the beſt wiſdom to direct your ſteps in the way of peace, and eſtabliſh your goings in righteouſneſs; that you may be a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people zealous of good works, having a regard to truth's honour, and true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in all things, living in the croſs of Chriſt, more than to mind temporal things or the profits of this world, that God's righteous ſeed may grow and thrive in all your minds, to the bringing forth plentifully ſuch fruits that beſt pleaſe him; and as you are willing to be one with the

            <head type="sub">The TESTIMONY of the MONTHLY MEETING of FRIENDS in Philadelphia, concerning our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Friend and Brother, BENJAMIN TROTTER, who was born in this City, in the ninth Month of the Year, 1699.</head>
            <p>HE was one whom the Lord early viſited, and reached unto by the reproofs of his Divine Light and Grace, for thoſe youthful vanities and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt converſation, which by nature he was prone to and purſued, to the grief of his pious mother, who was religiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to reſtrain him, but as he became obedient to the renewed viſitations of the heavenly call, denying himſelf of thoſe things he was reproved for, he not only learned to ceaſe from doing evil, but to live in the practice of doing well; and continuing faithful, became an example of plainneſs and ſelf-denial, for which he ſuffered much ſcoffing and mocking of thoſe who had been his companions in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet he neither fainted nor was turned aſide by the reproaches of the ungodly, which thus fell to his lot, for his plain teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony againſt their evil conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:012565_0201_0F8B15436C6101F8"/>IN the twenty-ſixth year of his age, he appeared in the work of the miniſtry, and laboured therein in much plainneſs and Godly ſincerity, adorning the doctrine he preached, by a humble circumſpect life and converſation, being exemplary in his diligence and induſtry to labour honeſtly for a livelihood, though often in much bodily infirmity and weakneſs, deſiring, as he ſometimes expreſſed, that he might owe no man any thing but love. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive openneſs and affability, drawing many of different denominations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him, he had ſome ſeaſonable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of admoniſhing and rebuking the evil doer and evil ſpeaker, which he did, in the plainneſs of an upright zeal for the promotion of piety and virtue, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with true brotherly kindneſs and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; reſpecting not the perſon of the proud nor of the rich, becauſe of his riches, but with Chriſtian freedom, declaring the truth to his neighbour, and was thus in private as well as public, a preacher of righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>IN his public miniſtry he was zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt errors both in principle and practice, and conſtantly concerned to preſs the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſity of obedience to the Principle of Divine Grace;<note place="margin">Tit. ii. 11.</note> a manifeſtation of which is given to every man; knowing, from his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it bringeth ſalvation to all them that obey and follow it's teachings
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012565_0202_0F8B15443042A128"/>
and was frequently enabled with energy and power to bear teſtimony to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his miraculous birth, his holy example in his life and precepts, and his death and ſufferings at Jeruſalem, by which he hath obtained eternal redemption for us.<note place="margin">Heb. ix. 12 &amp; 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IN his public teſtimony a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his laſt ſickneſs, he expreſſed his apprehenſions, that his time among us would be ſhort, and fervently exhorted to watchfulneſs and care, to keep our lamps trimmed, and our lights burning, and urged the neceſſity of being prepared to meet the bridegroom, as not knowing at what hour he will come.</p>
            <p>HE travelled ſeveral times, and viſited moſt of the meetings of Friends in this province and New-Jerſey, and ſome in the adjacent provinces, but was not much from home; being upwards of forty years a diligent attender of our religious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this city, zealouſly concerned for the maintaining our Chriſtian diſcipline in meekneſs and true charity, careful in the exerciſe of that part of pure religion, viſiting the widow and fatherleſs in their afflictions, and often qualified to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter relief and conſolation to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected minds.</p>
            <p>AFFLICTIONS of divers kinds, and ſome very deep and exerciſing, fell to his lot through the courſe of his life, which
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012565_0203_0F8B1544EF881B28"/>
he was enabled to bear with exemplary patience and reſignation, and particularly through his laſt illneſs, in which, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ſix weeks, he underwent great difficulty and pain, being afflicted with the aſthma and dropſy, ſo that he ſuffered much, yet was never heard to utter a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur or complaint, but frequently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his thankfulneſs, that he had not more pain, and often engaged in prayer, that he might be preſerved in patience to the end, which was graciouſly granted him; ſo that he was capable of ſpeaking to the comfort and edification of thoſe who viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and from the fervent love of the brethren, which evidently appeared thro' his life, and moſt conſpicuouſly during his laſt illneſs, and even in the hour of his death, we have a well-grounded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that he is paſſed unto life, and hath received the reward of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>HIS body was attended by a great number of Friends and others, his fellow-citizens of divers religious denominations, to our Meeting-houſe in High-ſtreet, on the 24th of the third month, 1768, and after a ſolemn Meeting, in which ſeveral living teſtimonies were borne, was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our burial ground in this city.</p>
