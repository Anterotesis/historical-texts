            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AGE OF REASON.</head>
            <p>IT has been my intention, for ſeveral years paſt, to publiſh my thoughts upon religion. I am well aware of the difficulties that attend the ſubject; and, from that conſideration, had reſerved it to a more advanced period of life. I intended it to be the laſt offering I ſhould make to my fellow citizens of all nations; and that, at a time, when the purity of the motive that induced me to it, could not admit of a queſtion, even by thoſe who might diſapprove the work.</p>
            <p>The circumſtance that has now taken place in France, of the total abolition of the whole national order of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and of every thing appertaining to compulſive ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of religion, and compulſive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly neceſſary; leſt, in the general wreck of ſuperſtition, of falſe ſyſtems of government, and falſe theology, we loſe ſight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.</p>
            <p>As ſeveral of my colleagues, and others of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens of France, have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual profeſſion of faith, I alſo will make mine; and I do this with all that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027458_0003_0FD3D92ED80C0568"/>
and frankneſs with which the mind of man commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with itſelf.</p>
            <p>I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happineſs beyond this life.</p>
            <p>I believe the equality of man, and I believe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties conſiſt in doing juſtice, loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow creatures happy.</p>
            <p>But, leſt it ſhould be ſuppoſed that I believe many other things in addition to theſe, I ſhall, in the progreſs of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reaſons for not believing them.</p>
            <p>I do not believe in the creed profeſſed by the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkiſh church, by the Proteſtant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.</p>
            <p>All national inſtitutions of churches, whether Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, Chriſtian, or Turkiſh, appear to me no other than human inventions ſet up, to terrify and enſlave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.</p>
            <p>I do not mean by this declaration to condemn thoſe who believe otherwiſe. They have the ſame right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is neceſſary to the happineſs of man, that he be mentally faithful to himſelf Infidelity does not conſiſt in believing, or in diſbelieving: it conſiſts in profeſſing to believe what he does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to calculate the moral miſchief, if I may ſo expreſs it, that mental lying has produced in ſociety. When <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> man has ſo far corrupted and proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the chaſtity of his mind, as to ſubſcribe his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himſelf for the commiſſion of every other crime. He takes up the trade of a prieſt for the ſake of gain, and in order to <hi>qualify</hi> himſelf for that trade, he begins with perjury.</p>
            <p>Can we conceive anything more deſtructive to moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity than this?</p>
            <p>Soon after I had publiſhed the pamphlet, COMMON SENSE, in America, I ſaw the exceeding probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027458_0004_0FD3D931787487A8"/>
that a Revolution in the Syſtem of Government would be followed by a Revolution in the Syſtem of Religion. The adulterous connection of church and ſtate, wherever it had taken place, whether Jewiſh, Chriſtian or Turkiſh, had ſo effectually prohibited, by pains and penalties, every diſcuſſion upon eſtabliſhed creeds, and upon firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of religion, that until the ſyſtem of government ſhould be changed, thoſe ſubjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world: but that whenever this ſhould be done, a revolution in the ſyſtem of religion would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Human inventions and prieſt-craft would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and man would return to the pure unmixed and unadulterated belief of one God, and no more.</p>
            <p>Every national church or religion has eſtabliſhed it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by pretending ſome ſpecial miſſion from God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to certain individuals. The Jews have their Moſes; The Chriſtians their Jeſus Chriſt, their apoſtles and ſaints; and the Turks their Mahomet; as if the way to God was not open to every man alike.</p>
            <p>Each of thoſe churches ſhow certain books which they call <hi>revelation,</hi> or the word of God. The Jews ſay that their word of God was given by God to Moſes face to face; the Chriſtians ſay, that their word of God came by divine inſpiration; and the Turks ſay, that their word of God (the Koran) was brought by an angel from heaven. Each of thoſe churches accuſes the other of unbelief; and, for my own part, I diſbelieve them all.</p>
            <p>As it is neceſſary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the ſubject, offer ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the word <hi>revelation.</hi> Revelation, when applied to religion, means ſomething communicated <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> from God to man.</p>
            <p>No one w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> deny or diſpute the power of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to make ſuch a communication if he pleaſes. But admitting, for the ſake of a caſe, that ſomething has been revealed to a certain perſon, and not revealed to any other perſon, it is revelation to that perſon only. When he tells to a ſecond perſon, a ſecond to a third, a third to a fourth, and ſo on, it ceaſes to be a revelation to all thoſe perſons. It is revelation to the firſt perſon
<pb facs="unknown:027458_0005_0FD3D9318053FC00"/>
only, and <hi>hear-ſay</hi> to every other; and conſequently they are not obliged to believe it.</p>
            <p>It is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call any thing a revelation that comes to us at ſecond hand, either verbally or in writing. Revelation is neceſſarily limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the firſt communication. After this, it is only an account of ſomething which that perſon ſays was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation made to him; and though he may find himſelf obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent upon me to believe it in the ſame manner, for it was not a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to <hi>me,</hi> and I have only his word for it that it was made to <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Moſes told the children of Iſrael that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the two tables of the commandments from the hand of God, they were not obliged to believe him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no other authority for it than his telling them ſo; and I have no other authority for it than ſome hiſtorian telling me ſo. The commandments carry no internal evidence of divinity with them. They contain ſome good moral precepts, ſuch as any man qualified to be a lawgiver or a legiſlator could produce himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having recourſe to ſupernatural intervention.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is, however, neceſſary to except the declaration, which ſays, that God <hi>viſits the ſins of the fathers upon the children.</hi> It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> contrary to every principle of moral juſtice.</note>
            </p>
            <p>When I am told that the Koran was written in heaven, and brought to Mahomet by an angel, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count comes to near the ſame kind of hearſay evidence, and ſecond hand authority, as the former. I did not ſee the angel myſelf, and therefore have a right not to believe it.</p>
            <p>When alſo I am told that a woman, called the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary, ſaid, or gave out that ſhe was with child with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cohabitation, with a man, and that her betrothed huſband, Joſeph, ſaid, that an angel told him ſo, I have a right to believe them or not; ſuch a circumſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a much ſtronger evidence than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bare word for it; but we have not even this; for neither Joſeph nor Mary wrote any ſuch matter themſelves. It is only reported by others that <hi>they ſaid ſo.</hi> It is hearſay upon
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027458_0006_0FD3D932D54C58C8"/>
hearſay, and I do not chuſe to reſt my belief upon ſuch evidence.</p>
            <p>It is, however, not difficult to account for the cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it that was given to the ſtory of Jeſus Chriſt being the Son of God. He was born at a time when the heathen mythology had ſtill ſome faſhion and repute in the world, and that mythology had prepared the people for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of ſuch a ſtory. Almoſt all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen mythology were reputed to be the ſons of ſome of their gods. It was not a new thing at that time to believe a man to have been celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially begotten; the intercourſe of gods with women was then a matter of familiar opinion. Their Jupiter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their accounts, had cohabited with hundreds: the ſtory, therefore, had nothing in it, either new, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful or obſcene: it was conformable to the opinions that then prevailed among the people called Gentiles, or mythologiſts, and it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thoſe people only that believed it. The Jews who had kept ſtrictly to the belief of one God, and no more, and who had always rejected the heathen mythology, never credited the ſtory.</p>
            <p>It is curious to obſerve how the theory of what is called the Chriſtian church, ſprung out of the tail of the heathen mythology. A direct incorporation took place in the firſt inſtance, by making the reputed found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be celeſtially begotten. The trinity of Gods that then followed was no other than a reduction of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er plurality, which was about twenty or thirty thouſand. The ſtatue of Mary ſucceeded the ſtatue of Diana of Epheſus. The deification of heroes changed into the cannonization of ſaints. The mythologiſts had gods for every thing; the Chriſtian mythologiſts had ſaints for every thing. The church became as crouded with the one, as the pantheon had been with the other; and Rome was the place of both. The Chriſtian theory is little elſe than the idolatry of the ancient mythologiſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the purpoſes of power and revenue; and it yet remains to reaſon and philoſophy to aboliſh the amphibious fraud.</p>
            <p>Nothing that is here ſaid can apply, even with the moſt diſtant reſpect, to the real character of Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:027458_0007_0FD3D95B088993D0"/>
He was virtuous and an amiable man. The morality that he preached and practiſed was of the moſt benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kind; and though ſimilar ſyſtems of morality had been preached by Confucius, and by ſome of the Greek philoſophers, many years before, by the Quakers ſince, and by many good men in all ages, it has not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by any.</p>

               </gap> birth, parentage, or any thing elſe. Not a line of what is called the New Teſtament is of his writing. The hiſtory of him is altogether the work of other people; and as to the account given of his reſurrection and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it was the neceſſary counterpart to the ſtory of his birth. His hiſtorians having brought him into the world in a ſupernatural manner, were obliged to take him out again in the ſame manner, or the firſt part of the ſtory muſt have fallen to the ground.</p>
            <p>The wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told, exceeds every thing that went before it. The firſt part, that of the miraculous conception, was not a thing that admitted of publicity; and therefore the tellers of this part of the ſtory had this advantage, that though they might not be credited, they could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. They could not be expected to prove it, becauſe it was not one of thoſe things that admitted of proof, and it was impoſſible that the perſon of whom it was told could prove it himſelf.</p>
            <p>But the reſurrection of a dead perſon from the grave, and his aſeenſion through the air, is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits of, to the inviſible conception of a child in the womb. The reſurrection and aſcenſion, ſuppoſing them to have taken place, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of public and occular demonſtration, like that of the aſcenſion of a balloon, or the ſun at noon day, to all Jeruſalem at leaſt. A thing which every body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to believe, requires that the proof and evidence of it ſhould be equal to all, and univerſal; and as the public viſibility of this laſt related act was the only evidence that could give ſanction to the former part, the whole of it falls to the ground, becauſe the evidence never was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en: Inſtead of this, a ſmall number of perſons, not

But it appears that Thomas did not believe the reſurrection; and, as they ſay, would not believe without having occular and manual demonſtration himſelf. <hi>So neither will I;</hi> and the reaſon is equally as good for me and for every other perſon as for Thomas.</p>
            <p>It is in vain to attempt to palliate or diſguiſe this matter The ſtory ſo far as relates to the ſupernatural part, has every mark of fraud and impoſition ſtamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of it. Who were the authors of it, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us now to know, as it is for us to be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the books in which the account is related, were written by the perſons whoſe names they bear. The beſt ſurviving evidence we have reſpecting this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair is the Jews. They are regularly deſcended from the people who lived in the times this reſurrection and aſcenſion is ſaid to have happened, and they ſay <hi>it is not true.</hi> It has long appeared to me a ſtrange incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency to cite the Jews, as a proof of the truth of the ſtory. It is juſt the ſame as if a man were to ſay, I will prove the truth of what I have told you, by producing the people who ſay it is falſe.</p>
            <p>That ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt exiſted, and that he was crucified, which was the mode of execution at that day, are hiſtorical relations ſtrictly within the limits of probability. He preached moſt excellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and the equality of man; but he preached alſo againſt the corruptions and avarice of the Jewiſh prieſts; and this brought upon him the hatred and vengeance of the whole order of prieſthood. The accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which thoſe prieſts brought againſt him, was that of ſedition and conſpiracy againſt the Roman government, to which the Jews were then ſubject and tributary; and it is not improbable that the Roman gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment might have ſome ſecret apprehenſion of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his doctrine as well as the Jewiſh prieſts; neither is it improbable that Jeſus Chriſt had in contemplation the delivery of the Jewiſh nation from the bondage of

the Romans. Between the two, however, this virtuous reformer and revolutioniſt loſt his life.</p>
            <p>It is upon this plain narrative of facts, together with another caſe I am going to mention, that the Chriſtian mythologiſts, calling themſelves the chriſtian church, have erected their fable, which, for abſurdity and extrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agance is not exceeded by any thing that is to be found in the mythology of the ancients.</p>
            <p>The ancient mythologiſts tell that the race of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants made war againſt Jupiter, and that one of them threw an hundred rocks againſt him at one throw; that Jupiter defeated him with thunder, and confined him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards under Mount Etna: and that every time the Giant turns himſelf, Mount Etna belches fire. It is here eaſy to ſee that the circumſtance of the mountain, that of its being a vulcano, ſuggeſted the idea of the fable; and that the fable is made to fit and wind itſelf up with that circumſtance.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian mythologiſts tell that their Satan made war againſt the Almighty, who defeated him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>find him afterwards, not under a mountain, but in a pit. It is here eaſy to ſee that the firſt fable ſuggeſted the idea of the ſecond; for the fable of Jupiter and the Giants was told many a hundred years before that of Satan.</p>
            <p>Thus far the ancient and the Chriſtian mythologiſts differ very little from each other. But the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atter have contrived to carry the matter much farther. They have contrived to connect the fabulous part of the ſtory of Jeſus Chriſt, with the fable originating from Mount Etna: and in order to make all the parts of the ſtory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> taken to their aid the tradition of the Jews; for the Chriſtian mythology is made up partly from the ancient mythology, and partly from the Jewiſh traditions.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian mythologiſts, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again, to bring on the ſequel of the fable. He is then introduced into the garden of Eden in the ſhape of a ſnake, or a ſerpent, and in that ſhape he enters into familiar conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Eve, who is no ways ſurpriſed to hear a

               </gap>te-à-tète is, that he perſuades her to eat an apple, and the eating of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple damns all mankind.</p>
            <p>After giving Satan this triumph over the whole creation, one would have ſuppoſed that the church my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologiſts would have been kind enough to ſend him back again to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But inſtead of this, they leave him at large, without even obliging him to give his parole. The ſecret of which is, that they could not do without him; and after being at the trouble of making him, they bribed him to ſtay. They promiſed him ALL the Jews, ALL the Turks by anticipation, nine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>omet into the bargain. After this, who can doubt the bountifulneſs of the Chriſtian mythology?</p>
            <p>Having thus made an inſurrection and a battle in heaven, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ich none of the combatants could be either killed or wounded—put Satan into the pit—let him out again—given him a triumph over the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e creation—damned all manking for the eating of an apple, the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian mythologiſts bring the two ends of their fable togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. They repreſent this virtuous and amiable man, Jeſus Chriſt, to be at once both God and man, and alſo the Son of God celeſtially begotten, on purpoſe to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, becauſe they ſay, that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple.</p>
            <p>Putting aſide every thing that might excite laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by its abſurdity, or deteſtation by its prophaneneſs, and confining ourſelves merely to an examination of the parts, it is impoſſible to conceive a ſtory more deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Almighty, more inconſiſtent with his wiſdom, more contradictor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to his power, than this ſtory is.</p>
            <p>In order to make for it a foundation to riſe upon, the inventors were under the neceſſity of giving to the being whom they call Satan, a power equally as great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:027458_0011_0FD3D96108F53A68"/>
if not greater than they attribute to the Almighty. They have not only given him the power of liberating himſelf from the pit, after what they call his fall, but they have made that power increaſe afterwards to infinity. Before this fail, they repreſent him only as an angel of limited exiſtence, as they repreſent the reſt. After his fall, he becomes, by their account, omnipreſent. He exiſts ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery where, and at the ſame time. He occupies the whole immenſity of ſpace.</p>
            <p>Not content with this deification of Satan, they repreſent him as defeating by ſtratagem, in the ſhape of an animal of the creation, all the power and wiſdom of the Almighty. They repreſent him as having compelled the Almighty to the <hi>direct neceſſity</hi> either of ſurrendering the whole of the creation to the government and ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Satan, or of capitulating for its redemption, by coming down upon earth and exhibiting himſelf upon a croſs in the ſhape of a man.</p>
            <p>Had the inventors of this ſtory told it the contrary way, that is, had they repreſented the Almighty as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling Satan to exhibit <hi>himſelf</hi> on a croſs in the ſhape of a ſnake, as a puniſhment for his new tranſgreſſion, the ſtory would have been leſs abſurd, leſs contradictory. But inſtead of this, they make the tranſgreſſor triumph and the Almighty fall.</p>
            <p>That many good men have believed this ſtrange fable, and lived very good lives under that belief (for credulity is not a crime) is what I have no doubt of. In the firſt place, they were educated to believe it, and they would have believed any thing elſe in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. There are alſo many who have been ſo enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtically enraptured by what they have conceived to be the infinite love of God to man, in making a ſacrifice of himſelf, that the vehemence of the idea has forbidden and deterred them from examining into the abſurdity and prophaneneſs of the ſtory. The more unnatural any thing is, the more is it capable of becoming the object of diſmal admiration.</p>
            <p>But if objects of gratitude and admiration are our deſire, do they not preſent themſelves every hour to our

eyes? Do we not ſee a fair creation prepared to receive us the inſtant we are born, a world furniſhed to our hands that coſt us nothing? Is it we that light up the ſun; that pour down the rain; and fill the earth with abundance? Whether we ſleep or wake, the vaſt machinery of the univerſe ſtill goes on. Are theſe things, and the bleſſings they indicate in future, nothing to us? Can our groſs feelings be excited by no other ſubjects than tragedy and ſuicide? Or is the gloomy pride of man become ſo intolerable, that nothing can flatter it but a ſacrifice of the Creator?</p>
            <p>I know that this bold inveſtigation will alarm many, but it would be paying too great a compliment to their credulity to forbear it upon that account. The times and the ſubject demand it to be done. The ſuſpicion that the theory of what is called the Chriſtian church is fabulous, is becoming very extenſive in all countries: and it will be a conſolation to men ſtaggering under that ſuſpicion, and doubting what to believe and what to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe, to ſee the ſubject freely inveſtigated. I therefore paſs on to an examination of the books called the Old and the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Theſe books, beginning with Geneſis and ending with Revelations (which by the bye, is a book of riddles that requires a Revelation to explain it) are, we are told, the word of God. It is therefore proper for us to know who told us ſo, that we may know what credit to give the report. The anſwer to this queſtion is, that nobody can tell, except that we tell one another ſo. The caſe, however, hiſtorically appears to be as follows:</p>
            <p>When the church mythologiſts eſtabliſhed their ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, they collected all the writings they could find, and managed them as they pleaſed. It is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us, whether ſuch of the writings as now appear, under the name of the Old and the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are in the ſame ſtate in which thoſe collectors ſay they found them; or whether they added, altered, abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or dreſſed them up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:027458_0013_0FD3D96661354438"/>
Be this as it may, they decided by vote, which of the books, out of the collection they had made, ſhould be the WORD OF GOD, and which ſhould not. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſeveral: they voted others to be doubtful, ſuch as the books called the Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raphy; and thoſe books which had a majority of votes, were voted to be the word of God.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Book of Luke was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Who the people were that did all this, we know nothing of; they call themſelves by the general name of the church: and this is all we know of the matter.</p>
            <p>As we have no other external evidence or authority for believing thoſe books to be the word of God than what I have mentioned, which is no evidence or author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity at all, I come, in the next place, to examine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal evidence contained in the books themſelves.</p>
            <p>IN the former part of this eſſay I have ſpoken of revelation. I now proceed further with that ſubject, for the purpoſe of applying it to the books in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Revelation is a communication of ſomething, which the perſon to whom that thing is revealed, did not know before. For if I have done a thing or ſeen it done, it needs no revelation to tell me I have done it, or ſeen it, nor to enable me to tell it, or to write it.</p>
            <p>Revelation, therefore, cannot be applied to any thing done upon earth of which man is himſelf the actor or the witneſs; and conſequently all the hiſtorical and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecdotal part of the Bible, which is almoſt the whole of it, is not within the meaning and compaſs of the word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and therefore is not the word of God.</p>

               </gap>ny thing elſe, what has revelation to do with theſe things? If they were facts, he could tell them himſelf; or his ſecretary, if he kept one, could write them, if they were worth either telling or writing; and if they were fictions, revelation could not make them true; and wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er true or not, we are neither the better nor the wiſer for knowing them.—When we contemplate the immenſity of that Being who directs and governs the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible WHOLE, of which the utmoſt ken of human ſight can diſcover but a part, we ought to feel ſhame at calling ſuch paltry ſtories the word of God.</p>
            <p>As to the account of the creation, with which the book of Geneſis opens, it has all the appearance of being a tradition which the Iſraelites had among them before they came into Egypt; and after their departure from that country, they put it at the head of their hiſtory, without telling, as it is moſt probable they did not know, how they came by it. The manner in which the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count opens, ſhews it to be traditionary. It begins ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly. It is nobody ſpeaks. It is nobody that hears. It is addreſſed to nobody. It has neither firſt, ſecond, nor third perſon. It has every criterion of being a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. It has no voucher.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cene ſtories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting vindictiveneſs, with which more than half the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is filled, it would be more conſiſtent that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God. It is a hiſtory of wickedneſs, that has ſerved to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my own part, I ſincerely deteſt it, as I deteſt every thing that is cruel.</p>
            <p>We ſcarcely meet with any thing, a few phraſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but what deſerves either our abhorrence, or our contempt, till we come to the miſcellaneous parts of the Bible. In the anonymous publications in the Pſalms and the Book of Job, more particularly, the latter, we find a great deal of elevated ſentiment reverentially expreſſed of the power and benignity of the Almighty; but they ſtand on no higher rank than many other compoſitions on ſimilar ſubjects as well before that time as ſince.</p>
            <p>The Proverbs, which are ſaid to be Solomon's, though moſt probably a collection (becauſe they diſcover a knowledge of life, which his ſituation excluded him from knowing) are an inſtructive table of ethics. They are inferior in keenneſs to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wiſe and oeconomical than thoſe of the American Franklin.</p>
            <p>All the remaining parts of the Bible, generally known by the name of the prophets, are the works of the Jewiſh poets and itinerant preachers, who mixed poetry, anecdote and devotion together: and thoſe works ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the air and ſtile of poetry, though in tranſlation.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>As there are many readers who do not ſee that a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is poetry unleſs it be in rhyme, it is for their information that I add this note.</p>
                  <p>Poetry conſiſts principally in two things: Imagery and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The compoſition of poetry differs from that of proſe in the manner of mixing long and ſhort ſyllables together. Take a long ſyllable out of a line of poetry, and put a ſhort one in the room of it, or put a long ſyllable where a ſhort one ſhould be, and that line will looſe its poetical harmony. It will have an effect upon the line like that of miſplacing a note in a ſong.</p>
                  <p>The imagery in thoſe books called the Prophets, appertains altogether to poetry. It is fictio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To ſhew that theſe writings are compoſed in poetical num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, I will take ten ſyllables as they ſtand in the book, and make a line of the ſame number of ſyllables (heroic meaſure) that ſhall rhyme with the laſt word. It will then be ſeen, that the compoſition of thoſe books is poetical meaſure. The inſtance I ſhall firſt produce is from Iſaiah.</p>

There is not throughout the whole book called the Bible, any word that deſcribes to us what we call a poet, nor any word that deſcribes what we call poetry. The caſe is, that the word <hi>prophet</hi> to which latter times have affixed a new idea, was the Bible word for poet, and the word <hi>propheſying</hi> meant the art of making poetry. It alſo meant the art of playing poetry to a tune upon any inſtrument of muſic.</p>
            <p>We read propheſying with pipes, taborets and horns; of propheſying with harps, with pſalteries, with cymbals, and with every other inſtrument of muſic then in faſhion. Were we now to ſpeak of propheſying with a fiddle, or with a pipe and tabor, the expreſſion would have no meaning, or would appear ridiculous, and to ſome people contemptuous, becauſe we have changed the meaning of the word.</p>
            <p>We are told of Saul being among the <hi>prophets,</hi> and alſo that he propheſied; but we are not told what they <hi>propheſied,</hi> nor what he <hi>propheſied.</hi> The caſe is, there was nothing to tell; for theſe prophets were a company of muſicians and poets; and Saul joined in the concert; and this was called <hi>propheſying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

The account given of this affair in the book called Samuel, is, that Saul met a <hi>company</hi> of prophets; a whole company of them! coming down with a pſaltery, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aboret, a pipe and a harp, and that they propheſied, and that he propheſied with them. But it appears after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Saul propheſied badly; that is, he performed his part badly; for it is ſaid, that "an evil ſpirit from God<note n="*" place="bottom">As thoſe men, who call themſelves divines and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I keep to the meaning of the word prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y.</note> came upon Saul, and he propheſied."</p>
            <p>Now were there no other paſſage in the book called the Bible than this, to demonſtrate to us that we have loſt the original meaning of the word prophecy, and ſubſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another meaning in its place, this alone would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; for it is impoſſible to uſe and apply the word propheſy in the place it is here uſed and applied, if we give to it the ſenſe which latter times have affixed to it. The manner in which it is here uſed ſtrips it of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious meaning, and ſhews that a man might then be a prophet, or might propheſy, as he may now be a poet or a muſician, without any regard to the morality or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality of his character. The word was originally a term of ſcience, promiſcuouſly applied to poetry and to muſic, and not reſtricted to any ſubject upon which poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and muſic might be exerciſed.</p>
            <p>Deborah and Barak are called prophets, not becauſe they predicted any thing, but becauſe they compoſed the poem or ſong that bears their name in celebration of an act already done. David is ranked among the prophets, for he was a muſician; and was alſo reputed to be (though perhaps very erroneouſly) the author of the Pſalms. But Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, are not called prophets. It does not appear from any accounts we have that they could either ſing, play muſic, or make po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:027458_0018_0FD3D972891E59C0"/>
We are told of the greater and leſſer prophets. They might as well tell us of the greater and leſſer God; for there cannot be degrees in propheſying conſiſtently with its modern ſenſe. But there are degrees in poetry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the phraſe is reconcileable to the caſe, when we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by it the greater and the leſſer poets.</p>
            <p>It is altogether unneceſſary, after this, to offer any obſervations upon what thoſe men, ſtiled prophets, have written. The axe goes at once to the root, by ſhewing that the original meaning of the word has been miſtaken, and conſequently all the inferences that have been drawn from thoſe books, the devotional reſpect that has been paid to them, and the laboured commentaries that have been written upon them under that miſtaken meaning, are not worth diſputing about. In many things, however, the writings of the Jewiſh poets deſerve a better fate than that of being bound up, as they now are, with the traſh that accompanies them, under the abuſed name of the word of God.</p>
            <p>If we permit ourſelves to conceive right ideas of things, we muſt neceſſarily affix the right idea, not only of unchangeableneſs, but of the utter impoſſibility of any change taking place, by any means or accident whatever, in that which we would honour with the name of the word of God; and therefore the word of God cannot exiſt in any written or human language.</p>
            <p>The continually progreſſive change to which the meaning of words is ſubject, the want of an univerſal language which renders tranſlations neceſſary, the errors to which tranſlations are again ſubject, the miſtakes of copyiſts and printers, together with the poſſibility of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alteration, are of themſelves evidences, that human language, whether in ſpeech or in print, cannot be the vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the word of God. The word of God exiſts in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe.</p>
            <p>Did the book called the Bible, excel, in purity of ideas and expreſſion, all the books that are now extant in the world, I would not take it for my rule of faith, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of God; becauſe the poſſibility would
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027458_0019_0FD3D973C83D2D38"/>
nevertheleſs exiſt of my being impoſed upon. But when I ſee throughout the greateſt part of this book, ſcarcely any thing but a hiſtory of the groſſeſt vices, and a collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt paltry and contemptible tales, I cannot diſhonour my Creator by calling it by his name.</p>
            <p>THUS much for the Bible. I now go on to the book called the New Teſtament. The <hi>new</hi> Teſtament! that is, the <hi>new</hi> Will, as if there could be two wills of the Creator.</p>
            <p>Had it been the object or the intention of Jeſus Chriſt to eſtabliſh a new religion, he would undoubtedly have written the ſyſtem himſelf, or <hi>procured it to be written</hi> in his life time. But there is no publication ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, authenticated with his name.</p>
            <p>All the books called the New Teſtament were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after his death. He was a Jew by birth and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and he was the Son of God in like manner that every other perſon is; for the Creator is the Father of all.</p>
            <p>The firſt four books, called Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, do not give a hiſtory of the life of Jeſus Chriſt, but only detached anecdotes of him. It appears from theſe books, that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months; and it was only during this ſhort time, that thoſe men became acquainted with him. They make mention of him, at the age of twelve years, ſitting, they ſay, among the Jewiſh doctors, aſking and anſwering them queſtions. As this was ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years before their acquaintance with him began, it is moſt probable they had this anecdote from his parents. From this time there is no account of him for about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years. Where he lived or how he employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf during this interval, is not known. Moſt probably he was working at his father's trade, which was that of a carpenter. It does not appear that he had any ſchool
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027458_0020_0FD3D9754B5513C8"/>
education, and the probability is that he could not write, for his parents were extremely poor, as appears from their not being able to pay for a bed when he was born.</p>
            <p>It is ſomewhat curious that the three perſons, whoſe names are the moſt univerſally recorded, were of very obſcure parentage. Moſes was a foundling. Jeſus Chriſt was born in a ſtable, and Mahomet was a mule driver. The firſt and the laſt of theſe men, were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of different ſyſtems of religion; but Jeſus Chriſt founded no new ſyſtem. He called men to the practice of moral virtues, and the belief of one God. The great trait in his character is philanthropy.</p>
            <p>The manner in which he was apprehended, ſhews that he was not much known at that time; and it ſhews alſo that the meetings he then held with his followers were in ſecret: and that he had given over or ſuſpended, preaching publicly. Judas could no otherwiſe betray. him than by giving information where he was, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out to the officers that went to arreſt him; and the reaſon for employing and paying Judas to do this, could ariſe only from the cauſes already mentioned, that of his not being much known, and living concealed.</p>
            <p>The idea of his concealment not only agrees very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with his reputed divinity, but aſſociates with it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of puſillanimity: and his being betrayed, or in other words, his being apprehended, on the information of one of his followers, ſhews that he did not intend to be apprehended, and conſequently that he did not intend to be crucified.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian mythologiſts tell us that Chriſt died for the ſins of the world, and that he came on <hi>purpoſe to die.</hi> Would it not then have been the ſame if he had died of a fever or of the ſmall pox, of old age, or of any thing elſe?</p>
            <p>The declaratory ſentence which, they ſay, was paſſed upon Adam in caſe he ate of the apple, was not, that <hi>thou ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

made no part of the ſentence that Adam was to ſuffer, and conſequently, even upon their tactic, it could make no part of the ſentence that Chriſt was to ſuffer in the room of Adam. A fever would have done as well as a croſs, if there was any occaſion for either.</p>
            <p>This ſentence of death, which they tell us, was thus paſſed upon Adam; muſt either have meant dying natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; that is, ceaſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o live; or have meant what theſe mythologiſts call damnation; and conſequently, the act of dying on the part of Jeſus Chriſt muſt according to their ſyſtem, apply as a prevention to one or other of thoſe two <hi>things</hi> happening to Adam and to us.</p>
            <p>That it does not prevent our dying is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

A religion thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded with quibble, ſubterfuge and pun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has a tendency to inſtruct its profeſſors in the practice of theſe arts. They acquire the habit without being aware of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>If Jeſus Chriſt was the Being which thoſe mythol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogiſts tell us he was, and that he came into this world to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> which is a word they ſometimes uſe inſtead of <hi>to die,</hi> the only real ſuffering he could have endured would have been <hi>to live.</hi> His exiſtence here was a ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

It is the reverſe of truth, and I become ſo tired with examining into its inconſiſtencies and abſurdities,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027458_0022_0FD3D97DD32A5388"/>
that I haſten to the concluſion of it, in order to proceed to ſomething better.</p>
            <p>How much, or what parts of the books called the New Teſtament, were written by the perſons whoſe names they bear, is what we can know nothing of, neith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are we certain in what language they were originally written. The matters they now contain may be claſſed under two heads; anecdote and epiſtolary correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>The four books already mentioned, Matthew, Mark. Luke, and John, are altogether anecdotal. They relate events after they have taken place. They tell what Jeſus Chriſt did and ſaid, and what others did and ſaid to him; and in ſeveral inſtances they relate the ſame event differently. Revelation is neceſſairly out of the queſtion with reſpect to thoſe books: not only becauſe of the diſagreement of the writers, but becauſe revelation cannot be applied to the relating of facts by the perſons who ſaw them done, nor to the relating or recording of any diſcourſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation by thoſe who heard it. The book called the Acts of the Apoſtles, an anonymous work, belongs alſo to the anecdotal part.</p>
            <p>All the other parts of the New Teſtament, except the book of enigmas, called the Revelations, are a collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of letters under the name of Epiſtles; and the forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of letters has been ſuch a common practice in the world that the probability is, at leaſt, equal whether they are genuine or forged. One thing, however, is much leſs equivocal, which is, that out of the matters contained in thoſe books, together with the aſſiſtance of ſome old ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the church has ſet up a ſyſtem of religion very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the character of the perſon whoſe name it bears. It has ſet up a religion of pomp and of revenue in the pretended imitation of a perſon whoſe life was hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and poverty.</p>
            <p>The invention of a purgatory, and of the releaſing of ſouls therefrom, by prayers, bou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ht of the church with money; the ſelling of pardons, diſpenſations, and indulgenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, are revenue laws, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>aring that name or
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027458_0023_0FD3D97F0ACFA788"/>
carrying that appearance. But the caſe nevertheleſs is, that thoſe things derive their origin from the proxyſm of the crucifixion, and the theory deduced therefrom, which was, that one perſon could ſtand in the place of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and could perform meritorious ſervices for him. The probability therefore is, that the whole theory or doctrine of what is called the redemption (which is ſaid to have been accompliſhed by the act of one perſon in the room of another) was originally fabricated on purpoſe to bring forward and build all thoſe ſecondary and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary redemptions upon; and that the paſſages in the books upon which the idea or theory of redemption is built, have been manufactured and fabricated for that purpoſe. Why are we to give this church credit, when ſhe tells us that thoſe books are genuine in every part, any more than we give her credit for every thing elſe ſhe has told us, or for the miracles ſhe ſays ſhe has performed. That ſhe <hi>could</hi> fabricate writings is certain, becauſe ſhe could write; and the compoſition of the writings in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is of that kind that any body might do it; and that ſhe <hi>did</hi> fabricate them is not more inconſiſtent with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, than that ſhe ſhould tell us, as ſhe has done, that ſhe could and did work miracles.</p>
            <p>Since then no external evidence can, at this long diſtance of time, be produced to prove, whether the church fabricated the doctrine called redemption or not, (for ſuch evidence, whether for or againſt, would be ſubject to the ſame ſuſpicion of being fabricated) the caſe can only be referred to the internal evidence which the thing carries of itſelf; and this affords a very ſtrong preſumption of its being a fabrication. For the internal evidence is, that the theory or doctrine of redemption has for its baſis, an idea of pecuniary juſtice, and not that of moral juſtice.</p>
            <p>If I owe a perſon money and cannot pay him, and he threatens to put me in priſon another perſon can take the debt upon himſelf, and pay it for me. But if I have committed a crime, every circumſtance of the caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> changed. Moral juſtice cannot take the innocent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>poſe juſtice to do this, is to deſtroy the principle of its exiſtence, which is the thing itſelf. It is then no longer juſtice. It is indiſcriminate revenge.</p>
            <p>This ſingle reflection will ſhew that the doctrine of redemption is founded on a mere pecuniary idea, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to that of a debt which another perſon might pay; and as this pecuniary idea correſponds again with the ſyſtem of ſecond redemptions, obtained through the means of money given to the church, for pardons, the probability is, that the ſame perſons fabricated both the one and the other of thoſe theories; and that, in truth there is no ſuch thing as redemption; that it is fabulous; and that man ſtands in the ſame relative condition with his Maker he ever did ſtand ſince man exiſted; and that it is his greateſt conſolation to think ſo.</p>
            <p>Let him believe this, and he will live more conſiſtently and morally than by any other ſyſtem. It is by his being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>urns what he calls devout. In the latter caſe, he conſumes his life in grief, or the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of it. His prayers are reproaches. His humility is ingratitude. He calls himſelf a worm, and the fertile earth a dunghill; and all the bleſſings of life by the thankleſs name of vanities. He deſpiſes the choiceſt gift of God to man, the GIFT OF REASON; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endeavoured to force upon himſelf the belief of a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem againſt which reaſon revolts, he ungratefully calls it <hi>human reaſon,</hi> as if man could give reaſon to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Yet with all this ſtrange appearance of humility, and this contempt for human reaſon, he ventures into the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt preſumptions. He finds fault with every thing. His ſelfiſhneſs is never ſatisfied; his ingratitude is never at an end. He takes on himſelf to direct the Almighty what to do, even in the government of the univerſe. He pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

and when it is rain he prays for ſun-ſhine. He follows the ſame idea in every thing that he prays for; for what is the amount of all his prayers, but an attempt to make the Almighty change his mind, and act otherwiſe than he does. It is as if he were to ſay—thou knoweſt not ſo well as I.</p>
            <p>BUT ſome perhaps will ſay, are we to have no word of God—No revelation; I anſwer yes. There is a word of God; there is a revelation.</p>
            <p>THE WORD OF GOD IS THE CREATION WE BEHOLD: And it is in <hi>this word,</hi> which no human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention can counterfeit or alter, that God ſpeaketh univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to man.</p>
            <p>Human language is local and changeable, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore incapable of being uſed as the means of unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and univerſal information. The idea that God ſent Jeſus Chriſt to publiſh, as they ſay, the glad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idings to all nations, from one end of the earth unto the other, is conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent only with the ignorance of thoſe who knew nothing of the extent of the world, and who believed, as thoſe world-faviours believed, and continued to believe for ſeveral centuries, (and that in contradiction to the diſcoveries of philoſophers, and the experience of navigators) that the earth was flat like a trencher; and that a man might walk to the end of it.</p>
            <p>But how was Jeſus Chriſt to make any thing known to all nations? He could ſpeak but one language, which was Hebrew; and there are in the world ſeveral hundred languages. Scarcely any two nations ſpeak the ſame language, or underſtand each other; and as to tranſlations, every m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n who knows any thing of languages, knows that it is impoſſible to tranſlate from one language into another, not only without loſing a great part of the original, but frequently of miſtaking the ſenſe: and beſides all this, the art of printing was wholly unknown at the time Chriſt lived.</p>
            <p>It is always neceſſary that the means that are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh any end, be equal to the accompliſhment of that end, or the end cannot be accompliſhed. It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

this that the difference between finite and infinite power and wiſdom diſcovers itſelf. Man frequently fails in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing his end, from a natural inability of power to the purpoſe, and frequently from the want of wiſdom to apply power properly. But it is impoſſible for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power and wiſdom to fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l as man faileth. The means it uſeth are always equal to the end: but human language, more eſpecially as there is not an univerſal language, is incapable of being uſed as an univerſal means of unchangeable and uniform informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore it is not the means that God uſeth in manifeſting himſelf univerſally to man.</p>
            <p>It is only in the CREATION that all our ideas and conceptions of a <hi>world of God</hi> can unite. The creation ſpeaketh an univerſal language, independently of human ſpeech or human language, multiplied and various as they be. It is an ever-exiſting original, which every man can read. It cannot be forged; it cannot be counterfeited; it cannot be loſt; it cannot be altered; it cannot be ſuppreſſed. It does not depend upon the will of man whether it ſhall be publiſhed or not; it publiſhes itſelf from one end of the earth to the other. It preaches to all nations and to all worlds; and this <hi>word of God</hi> reveals to man all that is neceſſary for man to know of God.</p>
            <p>Do we want to contemplate his power? We ſee it in the immenſity of the creation. Do we want to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template his wiſdom? We ſee it in the unchangeable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by which the incomprehenſible Whole is governed. Do we want to contemplate his manificence? We ſee it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We ſee it in his not withholding that-abundance even from the unthankful. In ſine, do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the ſcripture, which any human hand might make, but the ſcripture called the creation.</p>
            <p>The only idea that man can affix to the name of God, is that of a <hi>firſt cauſe,</hi> the cauſe of all things. And incomprehenſibly difficult as it is for man to conceive what a firſt cauſe is, he arrives at the belief of it, from the ten-fold greater difficulty of diſbelieving it. It is difficult beyond deſcription to conceive that ſpace can have no
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027458_0027_0FD3D9850C738000"/>
end; but it is more difficult to conceive an end. It is difficult, beyond the power of man to conceive an eternal duration of what we call time; but it is more impoſſible to conceive a time when there ſhall be no time. In like manner of reaſoning, every thing we behold carries in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the internal evidence that it did not make itſelf. Every man is an evidence to himſelf that he did not make himſelf; neither could his father make himſelf, nor his grandfather, nor any of his race; neither could any tree, plant or animal, make itſelf: and it is the conviction ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this evidence, that carries us on, as it were, by neceſſity, to the belief of a firſt cauſe, eternally exiſting, of a nature totally different to any material exiſtence we know of, and by the power of which all things exiſt, and this firſt cauſe man calls God.</p>
            <p>It is only by the exerciſe of reaſon, that man can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover God. Take away that reaſon, and he would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of underſtanding any thing; and, in this caſe, it would be juſt as conſiſtent to read even the book called the bible, to a horſe as to a man. How then is it that thoſe people pretend to reject reaſon?</p>
            <p>Almoſt the only parts in the book called the bible, that convey to us any idea of God, are ſome chapters in Job, and the 19th pſalm. I recollect no other. Thoſe parts are true <hi>deiſtical</hi> compoſitions; for they treat of the <hi>deity</hi> through his works. They take the book of Creation is the word of God; they refer to no other book, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>What more does man want to know than that the hand, or power that made theſe things, is divine, is omnip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otent? Let him believe this, with the force it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to repel, if he permits his reaſon to act, and his rule of moral life will follow of courſe.</p>
            <p>The alluſions in Job have all of them the ſame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with this pſalm; that of deducing or proving a truth, that would be otherwiſe unknown, from truths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known.</p>
            <p>I recollect not enough of the paſſages in Job to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert them correctly: but there is one that occurs to me that is applicable to the ſubject I am ſpeaking upon.—"Canſt thou by <hi>ſearching</hi> find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty to perfection.</p>
            <p>I know not how the printers have pointed this paſſage, for I keep no Bible: but it contains two diſtinct queſtions that admit of diſtinct anſwers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Canſt thou by <hi>ſearching</hi> find out God? Yes. Becauſe, in the firſt place, I know I did not make myſelf, and yet I have exiſtence; and by <hi>ſearching</hi> into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other things, I find that no other thing could make it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and yet millions of other things exiſt; therefore, it is that I know by poſitive concluſion, reſulting from this ſearch, that there is a power ſuperior to all thoſe things, and that power is God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Canſt thou find out the Almighty to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</hi> No. Not only becauſe the power and wiſdom he has manifeſted in the ſtructure of the creation that I
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027458_0029_0FD3D9880646D3A8"/>
behold, is to me incomprehenſible; but becauſe even this manifeſtation, great as it is, is probably but a ſmall diſplay of that immenſity of power and wiſdom, by which millions of other worlds, to me inviſible by their diſtance, were created and continue to exiſt.</p>
            <p>It is evident that both theſe queſtions were put to the reaſon of the perſon to whom they are ſuppoſed to have been addreſſed; and it is only by admitting the firſt queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be anſwered affirmatively, that the ſecond could follow. It would have been unneceſſary and, even ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, to have put a ſecond queſtion more difficult than the firſt, if the firſt queſtion had been anſwered negatively. The two queſtions have different objects, the firſt refers to the exiſtence of God, the ſecond to his attributes. Reaſon can diſcover the one, but it falls infinitely ſhort in diſcovering the whole of the other.</p>
            <p>I recollect not a ſingle paſſage in all the writings aſcribed to the men called apoſtles, that conveys any idea of what God is. Thoſe writings are chiefly controverſial; and the gloomineſs of the ſubject they dwell upon, that of a man dying in agony on a croſs, is better ſuited to the gloomy genius of a monk in a cell, by whom it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they were written, than to any man breathing the open air of the creation. The only paſſage that occurs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> me, that has any reference to the works of God, by which only his power and wiſdom can be known, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to have been ſpoken by Jeſus Chriſt, as a remedy againſt diſtruſtful care. "Behold the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lies of the field, they toil not, neither do they ſpin." This, however, is far inferior to the a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſions in Job, and in the 19th pſalm; but it is ſimilar in idea, and the modeſty of the imagery is correſpondent to the modeſty of the man.</p>
            <p>As to the chriſtian ſyſtem of faith, it appears to me as a ſpecies of atheiſm; a fort of religions denial of God. It profeſſes to believe in a man rather than in God. It is a compound, made up chiefly of maniſm with but little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and is as near to atheiſm as twilight is to darkneſs.

The effect of this obſcurity has been that of turning every thing upſide down, and repreſenting it in reverſe; and among the revolutions it has thus magically produced, it has made a revolution in theology.</p>
            <p>That which is now called natural philoſophy, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the whole circle of ſcience, of which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>onomy occupies the chief place, is the ſtudy of the works of God and of the power and wiſdom of God in his works, and is the true theology.</p>
            <p>As the theology that is now ſtudied in its place, it is the ſtudy of human opinions and of human fancies <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> God. It is not the ſtudy of God himſelf in the works that he has made, but in the works or writings that man has made; and it is not among the leaſt of the miſchiefs that the chriſtian ſyſtem has done to the world, that it has abandoned the original and beautiful ſyſtem of theology, like a beautiful innocent, to diſtreſs and reproach, to make room for the hag of ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p>The book of Job, and the 19th pſalm, which even the church admits to be more ancient than the chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical order in which they ſtand in the book called the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are theological orations conformable to the original ſyſtem of theology. The internal evidence of thoſe prations proves to a demonſtration, that the ſtudy and contemplation of the words of creation, and of the power and wiſdom of God, revealed and manifeſted in thoſe works, made a great part of the religious devotion of the times in which they were written; and it was this devotional ſtudy and contemplation that led to the diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of the principles upon which what are now cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed Sciences are eſtabliſhed; and it is to the diſcovery of theſe principles that a moſt a I the Arts that contribute to the convenience of human life owe their exiſtence. Every principal art has ſome ſcience for its parent, though the perſon who mechanically performs the work does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and but very ſeldom, perceive the connection.</p>
            <p>IT is a fraud of the chriſtian ſyſtem to call the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences <hi>human inventions;</hi> it is only the application of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027458_0031_0FD3D98B0DB7A090"/>
them that is human. Every ſcience has for its baſis a ſyſtem of principles as fixed and unalterable as thoſe by which the univerſe is regulated and governed. Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make principles; he can only diſcover them:</p>
            <p>For example. Every perſon who looks at an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack ſees an account when an eclipſe will take place, and he ſees also that it never fails to take place according to the account there given. This ſhews that man is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the laws by which the heavenly bodies move. But it would be ſomething worſe than ignorance, were any church on earth to ſay, that thoſe laws are an human invention.</p>
            <p>It would alſo be ignorance, or ſomething worſe, to ſay, that the ſcientific principles, by the aid of which man is enabled to calculate and fore-know when an eclipſe will take place, are an human invention. Man cannot invent any thing that is eternal and immutable; and the ſcientific principles he employs for this purpoſe, muſt, and are, of neceſſity, as eternal and immutable as the laws by which the heavenly bodies move, or they could not be uſed as they are, to aſcertain the time when, and the manner how an eclipſe will take place.</p>
            <p>The ſcientific principles that man employs to obtain the fore-knowledge of an eclipſe, or of any thing elſe relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained chiefly in that part of ſcience called trigonometry, or the properties of a triangle, which, when applied to the ſtudy of the heavenly bodies, is called aſtronomy; when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to direct the courſe of a ſhip on the ocean, it is called navigation; when applied to the conſtruction of figures drawn by a rule and compaſs, it is called geometry, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the conſtruction of plans of edifices, it is called archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture; when applied to the meaſurement of any portion of the ſurface of the earth, it is called land ſurveying. In fine, it is the ſoul of ſcience. It is an eternal truth: it contains the <hi>mathematical demonſtration</hi> of which man ſpeaks, and the extent of its uſes are unknown.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, that man can make or draw a triangle, and therefore a triangle is an human invention.</p>
            <p>But the triangle, when drawn, is no other than the image of the principle; it is a delineation to the eye,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027458_0032_0FD3D98C8C3EE340"/>
and from thence to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of a principle that would otherwiſe be imperceptible. The triangle does not make the principle, any more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

All the properties of a triangle exiſt independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of the figure, and exiſted before any triangle was drawn or thought of by man.

            <p>In the ſame manner as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> may be ſaid that man can make a triangle, ſo alſo it may be ſaid, he can make the mechanical inſtrument called the lever. But the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by which the lever acts as a thing diſtinct from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and would exiſt if the inſtrument did not: it attaches itſelf to the inſtrument after it is made; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument therefore can act no otherwiſe than it does act; neither can all the effort of human invention make it act otherwiſe. That which in all ſuch caſes, man calls the <hi>effect,</hi> is no other than the principle itſelf, rendered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to the ſenſes.</p>
            <p>Since then man cannot make principles, from whence did he gain a knowledge of them, ſo as to be able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them not only to things on earth, but to aſcertain the motion of bodies ſo immenſely diſtant from him as all the heavenly bodies are? From whence, I aſk, <hi>could</hi> he gain that knowledge, but from the ſtudy of the true theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy?</p>
            <p>It is the ſtructure of the univerſe that has taught this knowledge to man. That ſtructure is an ever exiſting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of every principle upon which every part of methematical ſcience is founded. The offspring of this ſcience is mechanics; for mechanics is no other than the principles of ſcience applied practically. The man who proportions the ſeveral parts of a mill, uſes the ſame ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific principles as if he had the power of conſtructing an univerſe: but as he cannot give to matter that inviſible agency, by which all the component parts of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe machine of the univerſe have influence upon each other, and act in motional uniſon together, without any
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027458_0033_0FD3DAF2097B0080"/>
apparent contact, and to which man has given the name of attraction, gravitation, and repulſion, he ſupplies the place of that agency by the humble imitation of teeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogs. All the parts of man's microcoſm muſt viſibly touch. But could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e gain a knowledge of that agency, ſo as to be able to apply it in practice, we might then ſay, that another <hi>canonical book</hi> of the word of God had been diſcovered.</p>
            <p>If man could after the properties of the lever, ſo alſo could he alter the properties of the triangle: for a lever (taking that ſort of lever which is called a ſteel-yard, for the ſake of explanation) forms, when in motion, a trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. The line it deſcends from (one point of that line being in the fulcrum) the line it deſcends to, and the chord of the ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which the end of the lever deſcribes in the air, are the three ſides of a triangle. The other arm of the lever deſcribes alſo a triangle; and the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding ſides of thoſe two triangles, calculated ſcientifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, or meaſured geometrically; and alſo the fines, tangents, and ſecants generated from the angles, and geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically meaſured have the ſame proportions to each other, as the different weights have that will balance each other on the lever, leaving the weight of the lever out of the caſe.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be ſaid that man can make a wheel and axis, that he can put wheels of different magnitudes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and produce a mill. Still the caſe comes back to the ſame point, which is, that he did not make the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that gives the wheels thoſe powers. That principle is as unalterable as in the former caſes, or rather it is the ſame principle under a different appearance to the eye.</p>
            <p>The power that two wheels, of different magnitudes, have upon each other, is in the ſame proportion as if the ſemidiameter of the two wheels were joined together, and made into that kind of lever I have deſcribed, ſuſpended at the part where the ſemidiameters join; for the two wheels ſcientifically conſidered, are no other than the two circles generated by the motion of the compound lever.</p>
            <p>It is from the ſtudy of the true theology, that all
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027458_0034_0FD3DAF3194540E8"/>
our knowledge of ſcience is derived, and it is from that knowledge that all the arts have originated.</p>
            <p>The Almighty Lecturer, by diſplaying the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſcience in the ſtructure of the univerſe, has invited man to ſtudy and to imitation. It is as if he had ſaid to the inhabitants of this globe that we call ours, "I have made an earth for man to dwell upon, and I have rendered the ſtarry heavens viſible, to teach him ſcience and the arts. He can now provide for his own comfort, AND LEARN FROM MY MUNIFICENCE TO ALL, TO BE KIND TO EACH OTHER."</p>
            <p>Of what uſe is it unleſs it be to teach man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that his eye is endued with the power of beholding, to an incomprehenſible diſtance, an immenſity of worlds revolving in the ocean of ſpace? Or of what uſe is it that this immenſity of worlds is viſible to man? What has man to do with the Pleiades, with Orion, with Siri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, with the ſtar he calls the north ſtar, with the moving orbs he has named Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury, if no uſes are to follow from their being viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? A leſs power of viſion would have been ſufficient for man, if the immenſity he now poſſeſſes, were given only to waſte itſelf, as it were, on an immenſe de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>art of ſpace glittering with ſhows.</p>
            <p>It is only by contemplating what he calls the ſtarry heavens, as the book and ſchool of ſcience, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers any uſe in their being viſible to him, or any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage refulting from his immenſity of viſion. But when he contemplates the ſubject in this light, he ſees an additional motive for ſaying that <hi>nothing was made in vain;</hi> for in vain would be this power of viſion if it taught man nothing.</p>
            <p>As the chriſtian ſyſtem of faith has made a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theology, ſo alſo has it made a revolution in the ſtate of learning. That which is now called learning, was not learning originally. Learning does not conſiſt, as the ſchools now make it to conſiſt, in the knowledge of languages, but in the knowledge of things to which lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage gives names.</p>
            <p>The Greeks were a learned people; but learning with them did not conſiſt in ſpeaking Greek any more
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027458_0035_0FD3DAF592B6C198"/>
than in a Roman's ſpeaking Latin, or a Frenchman's ſpeaking French, or an Engliſhman's ſpeaking Engliſh. From what we know of the Greeks, it does not appear that they knew or ſtudied any language but their own; and this was one cauſe of their being ſo learned; it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them more time to apply themſelves to better ſtudies. The ſchools of the Greeks were ſchools of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and philoſophy, and not of languages; and it is in the knowledge of the things that ſcience and philoſophy teach, that learning conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Putting aſide, as matter of diſtinct conſideration, the outrage offered to the moral juſtice of God, by ſuppoſing him to make the innocent ſuffer for the guilty, and alſo the looſe morality and low contrivance of ſuppoſing him to change himſelf into the ſhape of a man, in order to make an excuſe to himſelf for not executing his ſuppoſed ſentence upon Adam: putting, I ſay, thoſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as matter of diſtinct conſideration, it is certain, that what is called the chriſtian ſyſtem of faith, including in it the whimſical account of the creation; the ſtrange ſtory of Eve, the ſnake and the apple; the amphibious idea of a man-god; the corporeal idea of the death of a god; the mythological idea of a family of gods; and the chriſtian ſyſtem of arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three, are all irreconcileable, not only to the divine gift of reaſon that God has given to man, but to the knowledge that man gains of the power and wiſdom of God, by the aid of the ſciences, and by ſtudying the ſtructure of the univerſe that God has made.</p>
            <p>The ſetters up, therefore, and the advocates of the chriſtian ſyſtem of faith, could not but foreſee that the continually progreſſive knowledge that man would gain by the aid of ſcience, of the power and wiſdom of God, manifeſted in the ſtructure of the univerſe, and in all the works of creation, would militate againſt, and call into queſtion, the truth of their ſyſtem of faith; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it bacame neceſſary to their purpoſe to cut learning down to a ſize leſs dangerous to their project, and this they effected by reſtricting the idea of learning to the dead ſtudy of dead languages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:027458_0036_0FD3DAF798308CF8"/>
They not only rejected the ſtudy of ſcience out of the chriſtian ſchools, but they perſecuted it; and it is only within about the laſt two centuries that the ſtudy has been revived. So late as 1610, Galileo, a Florentine, diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered and introduced the uſe of teleſcopes, and by applying them to obſerve the motions and appearances of the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly bodies, afforded additional means for aſcertaining the true ſtructure of the univerſe. Inſtead of being eſteemed for theſe diſcoveries, he was ſentenced to renounce them or the opinions reſulting from them, as a damnable hereſy. And prior to that time Vigi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ius was condemned to be burned for aſſerting the antipodes; or, in other words, that the earth was a globe, and habitable in every part where there was land, yet the truth of this is now too well know even to be told.</p>
            <p>If the belief of errors not morally bad did no miſchief it would make no part of the moral duty of man to oppoſe and remove them. There was no moral ill in believing the earth flat like a trencher, any more than there was moral virtue in believing it was round like a globe; neither was there any moral ill in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the Creator made no other world than this, any more than there was moral virtue in believing that he made millions, and that the infinity of ſpace is filled with worlds. But when a ſyſtem of religion is made to grow out of a ſuppoſed ſyſtem of creation that is not true, and to unite itſelf there with in a manner almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable therefrom, the caſe aſſumes an entirely different ground. It is then that errors not morally bad, become fraught with the ſame miſchiefs as if they were. It is then that the truth, though otherwiſe indifferent in itſelf, becomes an eſſential, by becoming the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riterion, that either confirms by corresponding evidence, or denies by contradictory evidence, the reality of the religion itſelf. In this view of the caſe, it is the moral duty of man to obtain every poſſible evidence that the ſtructure of the heavens, or any other part of creation affords, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſyſtems of religion. But this, the ſupporters or partizans of the chriſtian ſyſtem, as if dreading the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027458_0037_0FD3DAF915588210"/>
inceſſantly oppoſed, and not only rejected the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but perſecuted the profeſſors. Had Newton or Deſcartes lived three or four hundred years ago, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued their ſtudies as they did, it is moſt probable they would not have lived to finiſh them; and, had Franklin drawn lightning from the clouds, at the ſame time, it would have been at the hazard of expiring for it in flames.</p>
            <p>Later times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals: but however unwilling the partizans of the chriſtian ſyſtem may be to believe or to acknowledge it, it is nevertheleſs true that the age of ignorance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced with the chriſtian ſyſtem. There was more knowledge in the world before that period, than for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny centuries afterwards; and as to religions knowledge, the chriſtian ſyſtem, as already ſaid, was only another ſpecies of mythology; and the mythology to which it ſucceeded was a corruption of an ancient ſyſtem of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.</p>
            <p>It is owing to this long interregnum of ſcience, and to no other cauſe, that we have now to look back through a vaſt chaſm of many hundred years to the reſpectable characters we call the ancients. Had the progreſſion of knowledge gone on proportionably with the ſtock that before exiſted that chaſm would have been filled up with characters riſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in knowledge to each other; and thoſe ancients, we now ſo much admire, would have appeared reſpectably in the back ground of the ſcene. But the chriſtian ſyſtem laid all waſte; and if we take our ſtand about the beginning of the ſixteenth century, we look back through that long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, to the times of the ancients, as over a vaſt ſandy deſert, is which not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is an inconſiſtency, ſcarcely poſſible to be credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that any thing ſhould exiſt under the name of a <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> that held it to be <hi>irreligious</hi> to ſtudy and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the ſtructure, of the univerſe that God had made. But the fact is too well eſtabliſhed to be denied. The event that ſerved more than any other to break the find link in this long chain of deſpotic ignorance, is that known by the name of the reformation by Luther. From
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027458_0038_0FD3DAFB918951A0"/>
that time, though it does not appear to have made any part of the intention of Luther, or of thoſe who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led reformers, the Sciences began to revive, and Liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, their natural aſſociate, began to appear. This was the only public good the reformation did; for with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to religious good, it might as well not have taken place. The mythology ſtill continued the ſame; and a multiplicity of national popes grew out of the downfal of the Pope of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus ſhewn, from the internal evidence of things, the cauſe that produced a change in the ſtate of learning, and the motive for ſubſtituting the ſtudy of the deed languages in the place of the Sciences, I proceed, in addition to the ſeveral obſervations already made in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this work, to compare, or rather to confront, the evidence that the ſtructure of the univerſe affords, with the chriſtian ſyſtem of religion. But as I cannot begin this part better than by referring to the ideas that occurred to me at an early part of life, and which I doubt not have occurred in ſome degree to almoſt every other perſon at one time or other, I ſhall ſtate what thoſe ideas were, and add there to ſuch other matters as ſhall ariſe out of the ſubject, giving to the whole, by way of preface, a ſhort introduction.</p>
            <p>My father, being of the quaker profeſſion, it was my good fortune to have an exceedingly good moral edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and a tolearble ſtock of uſeful learning. Though I went to the grammer ſchool,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Grammar School at Thetford, in Norfolk.</note> I did not learn Latin, not only becauſe I had no inclination to learn languages, but becauſe of the objection the quakers have againſt the books in which the language is taught. But this did not prevent me from being acquainted with the ſubjects of all the Latin books uſed in the ſchool.</p>
            <p>The natural bent of my mind was to ſcience. I had ſome turn, and I believe ſome talent, for poetry; but this
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027458_0039_0FD3DAFB96AB3900"/>
I rather repreſſed than encouraged, as leading too much into the field of imagination. As ſoon as I was able I purchaſed a pair of globes, and attended the philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lectures of Martin and Ferguſon, and became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards acquainted with Dr. Bevis, of the ſociety called the Royal Society, then living in the Temple, and as excellent aſtronomer.</p>
            <p>I had no diſpoſition for what was called politics. It preſented to my mind no other idea than is contained in the word Jockeyſhip. When, therefore, I turned my thoughts toward, matters of government, I had to form a ſyſtem for myſelf that accorded with the moral and philoſophic principles in which I had been educated. I few, or at leaſt I thought I ſaw, a vaſt ſcene opening it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the world in the affairs of America; and it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that unleſs the Americans changed the plan they were then purſuing, with reſpect to the government of England, and declared themſelves independent, they would not only involve themſelves in a multiplicity of new dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, but ſhut out the proſpect that was then offering itſelf to mankind, through their means. It was from theſe motives that I publiſhed the work known by the name of COMMON SENSE, which is the firſt work I ever did publiſh: and ſo far as I can judge of myſelf, I believe I never ſhould have been known in the world as an author on any ſubject whatever, had it not been for the affairs of America. I wrote COMMON SENSE the latter end of the year 1775, and publiſhed it the firſt of January, 1776. Independence was declared the fourth of July following. Any perſon who was made obſervations on the ſtate and progreſs of the human mind, by obſerving his own, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have obſerved that there are two diſtinct claſles of what we call Thoughts: thoſe that we produce in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by reflection and the act of thinking, and thoſe that bolt into the mind of their own accord. I have always made it a rule to treat thoſe voluntary viſitors with civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, taking care to examine, as well as I was able, if they were worth entertaining; and it is from them I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired almoſt all the knowledge that I have. As to the learning that any perſon gains from ſchool education, it
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:027458_0040_0FD3DAFCD37F5540"/>
ſerves only, like a ſmall capital, to put him in the way of beginning learning for himſelf afterwards. Every perſon of learning is finally his own teacher; the reaſon of which is that principles being of a diſtinct quality to circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cannot be impreſſed upon the memory. Their place of mental reſidence is the underſtanding, and they are never ſo laſting as when they begin by conception. Thus much for the introductory part.</p>
            <p>From the time I was capable of conceiving an idea, and acting upon it by reflection, I either doubted the truth of the chriſtian ſyſtem, or thought it to be a ſtrange affair; I ſcarcely know which it was; but I we I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when about ſeven or eight years of age, hearing a ſermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the church, upon the ſubject of what is called <hi>Rede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ption by the Death of the Son of God.</hi> After the ſermon was ended, I went into the garden and as I was going down the garden ſtep (for I perfectly recollect the ſpot) I revolted at the recollection of what I had heard, and thought to myſelf that it was making God Almighty act like a paſſionate man that killed his ſon when he could not revenge himſelf any other way; and as I was ſure a man would be hanged that did ſuch a thing, I could not ſee for what purpoſe they preach ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. This was not one of thoſe kind of thoughts that had any thing in it of childiſh levity; it was to me a ſerious reflection, ariſing from the idea I had, that God was too good to do ſuch an action, and alſo too Almighty to be under any neceſſity of doing it. I believe in the ſame manner to this moment; and I moreover believe, that any ſyſtem of religion that has any thing in it that ſhocks the mind of a child cannot be a true ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>It ſeems as if parents of the chriſtian profeſſion, were aſhamed to tell their children any thing about the principles of their religion. They ſometimes inſtruct them in morals, and talk to them of the goodneſs of what they call Providence: for the chriſtian mythology has five der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: there is God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghoſt, the God Providence, and the Goddeſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027458_0041_0FD3DAFF74063108"/>
But the chriſtian ſtory of God the Father putting his ſon to death, or employing people to do it (for that is the plain language of the ſtory) cannot be told by a parent to a child; and to tell him that it was done to make man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind happier and better, is making the ſtory ſtill worſe, as if mankind could be improved by the example of murder; and to tell him that all this is a myſtery, is only making an excuſe for the incredibility of it.</p>
            <p>How different is this to the pure and ſimple profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Deiſm? The true Deiſt has but one Deity; and his religion conſiſts in contemplating the power, wiſdom, and benignity of the Deity in his works, and in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to imitate him in every thing moral, ſcientifical, and mechanical.</p>
            <p>The religion that approaches the neareſt of all others to true deiſm, in the moral and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> benign part thereof, is that profeſſed by the quakers, but they have contracted themſelves too much by leaving the works of God out of their ſyſtem. Though I reverence their philanthropy, I cannot help ſmiling at the conceit, that if the taſte of a quaker could have been conſulted at the creation, what a ſilent and drab-coloured creation it would have been! Not a flower would have bloſſomed its gaieties, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a bird been permitted to ſing.</p>
            <p>QUITTING theſe reflections, I proceed to other matters. After I had made myſelf maſter of the uſe of the globes and of the orrery, and conceived an idea of the infinity of ſpace, and of the eternal diviſibility of matter, and obtained, at leaſt, a general knowledge of what is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led natural philoſophy, I began to compare, or, as I have before ſaid, to confront the internal evidence thoſe things afford with the chriſtian ſyſtem of faith.</p>
            <p>Though it is not a direct article of the chriſtian ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem that this world that we inhabit is the whole of the hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable creation, yet it is ſo worked up therewith, from what is called the Moſaic account of the creation, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Eve and the apple, and the counterpart of that ſtory,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027458_0042_0FD3DB00B5CDF0E8"/>
the death of the Son of God, that to believe otherwiſe; that is, to believe that God created a plurality of worlds at leaſt as numerous as what we call ſtars, renders the chriſtian ſyſtem of faith at once little and ridiculous, and ſoatters it in the mind like feathers in the air. The two beliefs cannot be held together in the ſame mind; and he who thinks that he believes both, has thought but little of either.</p>
            <p>Though the belief of a plurality of worlds was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to the ancients, it is only wihtin the laſt three cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies that the extent and dimenſions of this globe that we inhabit have been aſcertained. Several veſſels, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tract of the ocean, have failed entirely round the world, as a man may march in a circle, and come round by the contrary ſide of the circle to the ſpot he ſet out from; The circular dimenſions of our world in the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part, as a man would meaſure the wideſt round of an apple or a ball, is only twenty-five thouſand and twenty Engliſh miles, reckoning ſixty-nine miles and an half to an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>torial degree, and may be failed round in the ſpace of about three years.</p>
            <p>A world of this extent may, at firſt thought, appear to us to be great; but if we compare it with the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſpace in which it is ſuſpended, like a bubble or a balloon in the air, it is infinitely leſs in proportion than the ſmalleſt grain of ſand is to the ſize of the world, or the fineſt particle of de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the whole ocean, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but ſmall; and as will be hereafter ſhewn, is only <hi>one</hi> of a ſyſtem of worlds, of which the univerſal creation is compoſed.</p>
            <p>It is not difficult to gain ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aint idea of the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſpace in which this and all the other worlds are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, if we follow a progreſſion of ideas. When we think of the ſize or dimenſions of a room, our ideas limit themſelves to the walls, and there they ſtop. But when our eye, or our imagination, darts into ſpace; that is, when it looks upward into what we call the open air; we cannot conceive any walls or boundaries it can have; and if for the ſake of reſting our ideas, we ſuppoſe a bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the queſtion immediately renews itſelf, and aſks, what
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:027458_0043_0FD3DB03A54AD448"/>
is beyond that boundary? and in the ſame manner, what is beyond the next boundary? and ſo on, till the fatiguing imagination returns and ſays, <hi>there is no end.</hi> Cortain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then the Creator was not pent for room when he made this world no larger than it is; and we have to ſeek the reaſon in ſomething elſe.</p>
            <p>If we take a ſurvey of our own world, or rather of this of which the Creator has given us the uſe, as our portion in the immenſe ſyſtem of creation, we find every part of it, the earth, the waters, and the air that ſurround it, field, and, as it were, crowded with life, down from the largeſt animals that we know of, to the ſmalleſt infects the naked eye can behold, and from thence to others ſtill ſmaller, and totally inviſible without the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the microſcope. Every tree, every plant, every leaf, ſerves not only as an habitation, but as a world to ſome nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous race, till animal exiſtence become ſo exceedingly refined, that the effluvia of a blade of graſs would be food for thouſands.</p>
            <p>Since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is to be ſuppoſed, that the immenſity of ſpace is a naked void, lying in eternal waſte? There is room for mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of worlds as large or larger than ours, and each of them millions of miles apart from each other.</p>
            <p>Having now arrived at this point, if we carry our ideas only one thought further, we ſhall ſee, perhaps, the true reaſon at leaſt a very good reaſon for our happineſs, why the Creator, inſtead of making one immenſe world, extending over an immenſe quantity of ſpace, has preferred dividing that quantity of matter into ſeveral diſtinct and ſparate worlds, which we call planets, of which our earth is one. But before I explain my ideas upon this ſubject, it is neceſſary (not for the ſake of thoſe that already know, but for thoſe who do not) to ſhew what the ſyſtem of the univerſe is.</p>
            <p>That part of the univerſe, that is called the ſolar ſyſtem (meaning the ſyſtem of worlds to which our earth belongs, and of which Sol, or in Engliſh language, the Sun, is the center) conſiſts, beſides the Sun, of fix diſtinct orbs, or planets, or worlds, beſides the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027458_0044_0FD3DB062F273A60"/>
ſecondary bodies, called ſatellites, or moons, of which our earth has one that attends her in her annual revolution round the Sun, in like manner as the other ſatellites, or moons attend the planets, or worlds, to which they ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally belong, as may be ſeen by the aſſiſtance of the tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope.</p>
            <p>The Sun is the center, round which thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ix worlds or planets, revolve at different diſtances therefrom, and in circles concentric to each other. Each world keeps conſtantly in nearly the ſame tract round the Sun, and continues at the ſame time, turning round itſelf, in nearly an upright poſition, as a top turns round itſelf when it is ſpinning on the ground, and leans a little ſide ways.</p>
            <p>It is this leaning of the earth (23½ degrees) that occaſions ſummer and winter, and the different length of days and nights. If the earth turned round itſelf in a poſition perpendicular to the plane or level of the circle it moves in round the Sun, as a top turns round, when it ſtands erect on the ground, the days and nights would be always of the ſame length, twelve hours day, and twelve hours night, and the ſeaſon would be uniformly the ſame throughout the year.</p>
            <p>Every time that a planet (our earth for example) turns round itſelf, it makes what we call day and night; and every time it goes entirely round the ſun, it makes what we call a year, conſequently our world turns three hundred and ſixty-five times round itſelf, in going once round the ſun.</p>

               </gap>ix worlds, and which are ſtill called by the ſame names, are Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Venus, this world that we call ours, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. They appear larger to the eye than the ſtars, being many million miles nearer to our earth than any of the ſtars are. The planet Venus is that which is called the evening ſtar, and ſometimes the morning ſtar, as ſhe happens to ſet after, or riſe before, the ſun, which, in either caſe, is never more than three hour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>The ſun, as before ſaid, being the center, the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, or world, neareſt the ſun, is Mercury; his diſtance from the ſun is thirty-four million miles, and he moves
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027458_0045_0FD3DB07619240E8"/>
round in a circle always at that diſtance from the ſun, as a top may be ſuppoſed to ſpin round in the tract in which a horſe goes in a mill. The ſecond world is Venus; ſhe is fifty-ſeven million miles diſtant from the ſun, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently moves round in a circle much greater than that of Mercury. The third world is this that we inhabit, an I which is ninety-five million miles diſtant from the ſun, and conſequently moves round in a circle greater than that of Venus. The fourth world is Mars; he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from the ſun one hundred and thirty-four million miles, and conſequently moves round in a circle greater than that of our earth. The fifth is Jupiter; he is diſtant from the ſun five hundred and fifty-ſeven million miles, and conſequently moves round to a circle greater than that of Mars. The ſixth world i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Saturn; he is diſtant from the ſun ſeven hundred and ſixty-three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion miles, and conſequently moves round in a circle that ſurrounds the circles or orbits of all the other worlds or planets.</p>
            <p>The ſpace, therefore, in the air, or in the immenſity of ſpace, that our ſolar ſyſtem takes up for the ſeveral worlds to perform their revolutions in round the ſun, is of the extent, in a ſtrait line, of the whole diameter of the orbit or circle in which Saturn moves round the ſun, which being double his diſtance from the ſun, is fifteen hundred and twenty-ſix million miles; and its circular extent is nearly five thouſand million, and its globical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is almoſt three thouſand five hundred millions times three thouſand five hundred million ſquare miles.</p>
            <p>But this, immenſe as it is, is only one ſyſtem of worlds; Beyond this, at a vaſt diſtance into ſpace, far beyond all power of calculation, are the ſtars, called the fixed ſtars. They are called fixed, becauſe they have no revolutionary motion as the ſix worlds or planets have, that I have been deſcribing. Thoſe fixed ſtars continue always at the ſame diſtance from each other, and always in the ſame place, as the ſun does in the center of our ſyſtem. The probability therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that each of thoſe fixed ſtars is alſo a ſun, round which another ſyſtem of worlds or planets, though too remote for us to diſcover,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027458_0046_0FD3DB0A749A8998"/>
performs its revolutions, as our ſyſtem of worlds does round our central ſun.</p>

               </gap>s to be filled with ſyſtems of worlds; and that no part of ſpace lies waſte, any more than any part of our globe of earth and water is left unoccupied.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus endeavoured to convey, in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and eaſy manner, ſome idea of the ſtructure of the univerſe, I return to explain what I before alluded to, namely, the great benefits ariſing to man in conſequence of the Creator having made a <hi>plurality</hi> of worlds, ſuch as our ſyſtem is, conſiſting of a central ſun, and ſix worlds, beſides ſatellites, in preference to that of creating one world only of a vaſt extent. It is an idea I have never loſt ſight of, that all our knowledge of ſcience is derived from the revolutions (exhibited to our eye, and from thence to our underſtanding) which thoſe ſeveral planets, or worlds, of which our ſyſtem is compoſed, make in their circuit round the ſun.</p>
            <p>Had then the quantity of matter which theſe ſix worlds contain been blended into one ſolitary globe, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to us would have been, that either no revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary motion would have exiſted, or not a ſufficiency of it to give us the ideas and the knowledge of ſcience we now have; and it is from the ſciences that all the mechanical arts that contribute ſo much to our earthly felicity and comfort are derived.</p>
            <p>As therefore the Creator made nothing in vain, ſo alſo muſt it be believed that he organized the ſtructure of the univerſe in the moſt advantageous manner for the benefit of man: and as we ſee, and from experience feel the benefits we derive from the ſtructure of the univerſe, formed as it is, which benefits we ſhould not have had the opportunity of enjoying, if the ſtructure, ſo far as relates to our ſyſtem, had been a ſolitary globe, we can diſcover, at leaſt, one reaſon why a <hi>plurality</hi> of worlds has been
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:027458_0047_0FD3DB0C9DB5FCD0"/>
made, and that reaſon calls forth the devotional gratitude of man, as well as his admiration.</p>
            <p>But it is not to us, the inhabitants of this globe, only, that the benefits ariſing from a plurality of worlds are limited. The inhabitants of each of the worlds, of which our ſyſtem is compoſed, enjoy the ſame opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of knowledge as we do. They behold the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary motions of our earth, as we behold theirs. All the planets revolve in ſight of each other; and therefore the ſame univerſal ſchool of ſcience preſents itſelf to all.</p>
            <p>Neither does the knowledge ſtop here. The ſyſtem of worlds next to us, exhibits in its revolution the ſame principles and ſchool of ſcience to the inhabitants of their ſyſtem, as our ſyſtem does to us, and in like manner throughout the immenſity of ſpace.</p>
            <p>Our ideas, not only of the Almightineſs of the Creator, but of his wiſdom and of his beneficence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come enlarged in proportion as we contemplate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and the ſtructure of the univerſe. The ſolitary idea of a ſolitary world rolling, or at reſt, in the immenſe ocean of ſpace, gives place to the cheerful idea of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of worlds, ſo happily contrived, as to adminiſter, even by their motion, inſtruction to man. We ſee our own earth filled with abundance; but we forget to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much of that abundance is owing to the ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific knowledge the vaſt machinery of the univerſe has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded.</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of thoſe reflections, what are we to think of the chriſtian ſyſtem of faith that forms itſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the idea of only one world, and that of no greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as is before ſhewn, than twenty-five thouſand miles? An extent, which a man walking at the rate of three miles an hour, for twelve hours in a day, could he keep on in a circular direction, would walk entirely round in leſs than two years. Alas! what is this to the mighty ocean of ſpace, and the Almighty power of the Creator.</p>
            <p>From whence then could ariſe the ſolitary and ſtrange conceit that the Almighty, who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protection, ſhould quit the care of all the reſt, and come to die in our world,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:027458_0048_0FD3DB0CA26B5338"/>
becauſe, they ſay, one man and one woman had eaten an apple? And on the other hand, are we to ſuppoſe that every world in the boundleſs creation, had an Eve, and apple, a ſerpent, and a redeemer? In this caſe, the perſon who is errevently called the Son of God, and ſometimes God himſelf, would have nothing elſe to do than to travel from world to world, in an endleſs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of death with ſcarcely a momentary interval of life.</p>
            <p>It has been, by rejecting the evidence, that the word, or works of God in the creation, affords to our ſenſes, and the action of our reaſon upon that evidence, that ſo many wild and whimſical ſyſtems of faith, and of religion, have been fabricated and ſet up. There may be many ſyſtems of religion, that, ſo far from being morally bad, are in many reſpects morally good: but there can be but ONE that is true, and that one neceſſarily muſt, as it ever will, be in all things conſiſtent with the ever exiſting word of God that we behold in his works. But ſuch is the ſtrange conſtruction of the chriſtian ſyſtem of faith, that every evidence the heavens afford to man, either directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it, or renders it abſurd.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible to believe, and I always feel pleaſure in encouraging myſelf to believe it, that there have been men in the world who perſuaded themſelves that what is called <hi>a pious fraud,</hi> might, at leaſt under particular circumſtances be productive of ſome good. But the fraud being once eſtabliſhed, could not afterwards be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; for it is with a pious fraud, as with a bad action, it begeſs a calamitous neceſſity of going on.</p>
            <p>The perſons who firſt preached the chriſtian ſyſtem of faith, and in ſome meaſure combined with it the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality preached by Jeſus Chriſt, might perſuade themſelves that it was better than the heathen mythology that then prevailed. From the firſt preachers, the fraud went on to the ſecond, and to the third, till the idea of its being a pious fraud became loſt in the belief of its being true; and that belief became again encouraged by the intereſt of thoſe who made a livelihood by preaching it.</p>
            <p>

But though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a belief might, by ſuch means, be rendered almoſt general among the laity, it is next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to account for the continual perſecution carried on by the church, for ſeveral hundred years, againſt the ſciences and againſt the profeſſors of ſcience, if the church, had not ſome record or ſome tradition that it was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally no other than a pious fraud, or did not foreſee that it could not be maintained againſt the evidence that the ſtructure of the univerſe afforded.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus ſhewn the irreconcileable inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies between the real word of God exiſting in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and that which is called <hi>the word of God,</hi> as ſhewn to us in a printed book that any man might make, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſpeak of the three principal means that have been employed in all ages, and perhaps in all countries, to impoſe upon mankind.</p>
            <p>Thoſe three means are, Myſtery, Miracle, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. The two firſt are incompatible with true religion, and the third ought always to be ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to myſtery, every thing we behold is, in one ſenſe a myſtery to us. Our own exiſtence is a myſtery; the whole vegetable world is a myſtery. We cannot account how it is that an acorn, when put into the ground, is made to develope itſelf and become an oak. We know now how it is that the feed we ſow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds and multiplies itſelf, and returns to us ſuch an abundant intereſt for ſo ſmall a capital.</p>
            <p>The fact, however, as diſtinct from the operating cauſe, is not a myſtery, becauſe we ſee it; and we know alſo the means we are to uſe, which is no other than put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſeed into the ground. We know therefore as much as is neceſſary for us to know; and that part of the operation that we do not know, and which if we did, we could not perform, the Creator takes upon himſelf and performs it for us. We are therefore better off than if we had been let into the ſecret, and left to do it for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:027458_0050_0FD3DB120A954250"/>
But though every created thing is in this ſenſe a myſtery, the word myſtery cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> applied to <hi>moral truth;</hi> any more than obſcurity can be applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth, and not a God of myſtery or obſcurity. Myſtery is the antagoniſt of truth. It is a fog of human invention, that obſcures truth, and repreſents it in diſtortion. Truth never envelopes <hi>itſelf</hi> in myſtery; and the myſtery in which it is at any time enveloped, is the work of its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, and never of itſelf.</p>
            <p>Religion, therefore, being the belief of a God, and the practice of moral truth, cannot have connection with myſtery. The belief of a God, ſo far from having any thing of myſtery in it, is of all beliefs the moſt eaſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ariſes to us, as is before obſerved, out of neceſſity. And the practice of moral truth, or in other words, a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical imitation of the moral goodneſs of God, is no other than our acting towards each other, as he acts benignly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all. We cannot <hi>ſerve</hi> God in the manner we ſerve thoſe who cannot do without ſuch ſervice; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the only idea we can have of ſerving God, is that of contributing to the happineſs of the living creation that God has made. This cannot be done by retiring our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ſociety of the world, and ſpending a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>The very nature and deſign of religion, if I may ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, prove, even to demonſtration, that it muſt be free from every thing of myſtery, and uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cumbered with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing that is myſterious. Religion, conſidered as a duty, is incumbent upon every living ſoul alike, and therefore muſt be on a level to the underſtanding and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of all. Man does not learn religion as he learns the ſecrets and myſteries of a trade. He learns the theory of religion by reflection. It ariſes out of the action of his own mind upon the things which he ſees, or upon what he may happen to hear or to read, and the practice joins itſelf therto. When men, whether from policy or pious fraud, ſet up ſyſtems of religion incompatible with the word or works of God in the creation, and not only above, but repugnant to human comprehenſion, they
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027458_0051_0FD3DB120E8F3FC8"/>
were under the neceſſity of inventing, or adopting a word that ſhould ſerve as a bar to all queſtions, inquiries and ſpeculations. The word <hi>myſtery</hi> anſwered this purpoſe; and thus it has happened that religion, which, in itſelf, is without myſtery, has been corrupted into a fog of myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>
            <p>As <hi>myſtery</hi> anſwered all general purpoſes, <hi>miracle</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as an occaſional auxiliary. The former ſerved to be wilder the mind, the latter to puzzle the ſenſe. The one was the lingo, the other the legerdemain.</p>
            <p>But before going further into this ſubject, it will be proper to inquire what is to be underſtood by a miracle.</p>
            <p>In the ſame ſenſe that every thing may be ſaid to be a myſtery, ſo alſo may it be ſaid, that every thing is a miracle, and that no one thing is a greater miracle than another. The elephant, though larger, is not a greater miracle than a mite; nor a mountain a greater mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle than an at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m. To an Almighty power, it is no more difficult to make the one than the other, and no more difficult to make a million of worlds than to make one. Every thing therefore is a miracle in one ſenſe; whilſt, in the other ſenſe, there is no ſuch thing as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. It is a miracle, when compared to our power, and to our comprehenſion. It is not a miracle, compared to the power that performs it. But as nothing in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription conveys the idea that is affixed to the word mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it is neceſſary to carry the inquiry further.</p>
            <p>Mankind have conceived to themſelves certain laws, by which, what they call nature is ſuppoſed to act; and that a miracle is ſomething contrary to the operation and effect of thoſe laws. But unleſs we know the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of thoſe laws, and of what are commonly called the powers of nature, we are not able to judge whether any thing that may appear to us wonderful or miraculous, be within, or be beyond, or be contrary to, her natural power of acting.</p>
            <p>The aſcenſion of a man ſeveral miles high into the air, would have every thing in it that conſtitutes the idea of a miracle, if it were not known that a ſpecies of air can be generated ſeveral times lighter than the common
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027458_0052_0FD44038832BD038"/>
atmoſpheric air, and yet poſſeſs elaſticity enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the balloon in which that light air is incloſed, from being compreſſed into as many times leſs bulk, by the common air that ſurrounds it. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, extracting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laſhes or ſparks of fire from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, as viſibly as from a ſteel ſtruck with a ſlint, and cauſing iron or ſteel to move without any viſible agent, would alſo give the idea of a miracle, if we were not acquainted with electricity and magnetiſm: ſo alſo would many other experiments in natural philoſophy, to thoſe who are not acquainted, with the ſubject. The reſtoring perſons to life, who are to appearance dead, as is practiſed upon drowned perſons, would alſo be a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, if it were not known that animation is capable of being ſuſpended, without being extinct.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there are performances by ſlight of hand, and by perſons acting in concert, that have a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous appearance, which, when known, are thought nothing of. And beſides theſe, there are mechanical and optical deceptions. There is now an exhibition in Paris, of ghoſts or ſpectres, which, thought it is not impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpectators as a fact, has an aſtoniſhing appearance. As therefore we know not the extent to which nature or art can go, there is no poſitive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riterion to determine what a miracle is; and mankind, in giving credit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, under the idea of their being miracles, are ſubject to be continually impoſed upon.</p>
            <p>Since then appearances are ſo capable of deceiving, and things not real have a ſtrong reſemblance to things that are, nothing can be more inconſiſtent than to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Almighty would make uſe of means, ſuch as are called miracles, that would ſubject the perſon who performed them to the ſuſpicion of being an impoſtor, and the perſons who related them to be ſuſpected of lying, and the doctrine intended to be ſupported thereby, to be ſuſpected as a fabulous invention.</p>
            <p>Of all the modes of evidence that ever were invented to obtain belief to any ſyſtem or opinion, to which the name of religion has been given, that of <hi>miracle,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:027458_0053_0FD4403AACC5F9A0"/>
ſucceſsful the impoſition may have been, is the moſt inconſiſtent. For, in the firſt place, whenever recourſe is had to ſhow, for the purpoſe of procuring that belief (for a miracle, under any idea of the word, is a ſhow) it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a lameneſs or weakneſs in the doctrine that is preached. And, in the ſecond place, it is degrading the Almighty into the character of a ſhow-man, playing tricks to amuſe and make the people ſtare and wonder. It is alſo the moſt equivocal ſort of evidence that can be ſet up; for the belief is not to depend upon the thing called a miracle, but upon the credit of the reporter, who ſays that he ſaw it; and therefore the thing, were it true, would have no better chance of being believed than if it were a lie.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe I were to ſay, that when I ſat down to write this book, a hand preſented itſelf in the air, took up the pen, and wrote every word that is herein written; would any body believe me? certainly they would not. Would they believe me a whit the more if the thing had been a fact? certainly they would not. Since, then, a real miracle, were it to happen, would be ſubject to the ſame fate as the falſhood, the inconſiſtency becomes the greater, of ſuppoſing the Almighty would make uſe of means that would not anſwer the purpoſe for which they were intended, even if it were real.</p>
            <p>If we were to ſuppoſe a miracle to be ſomething ſo entirely out of the courſe of what is called nature, that ſhe muſt go out of that courſe to accompliſh it; and we ſee an account given of ſuch miracle by the perſon who ſaid he ſaw it, it raiſes a queſtion in the mind, very eaſily decided; which is, Is it more probable that nature ſhould go out of her courſe, or that a man ſhould tell a lie? We have never ſeen in our time, nature go out of her courſe, but we have good reaſon to believe that millions of lies have been told in the ſame time; it is, therefore, at leaſt millions to one, that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie.</p>
            <p>The ſtory of the whale ſwallowing Jonah, though a whale is large enough to do it, borders greatly on the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous; but it would have approached nearer to the idea

            <p>I have too much reſpect for the moral character of Chriſt, to believe that he told this whale of a miracle himſelf; neither is it eaſy to account for what purpoſe it could have been fabricated, unleſs it were to impoſe upon the connoiſſeurs of miracles, as is ſometimes practiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the connoiſſeurs of Queen Anne's farthings, and collectors of relics and antiquities; or to render the belief of miracles rediculous, by outdoing miracle, as Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote outdid chivalry; or to embarraſs the belief of miracles by making it doubtful by what power, whether of God, or of the devil, any thing called a miracle was performed. It requires, however, a great deal of faith in the devil to belief this miracle.</p>
            <p>In every point of view, in which thoſe things called miracles can be placed and conſidered, the reality of them is improbable, and their exiſtence unneceſſary. They would not, as before obſerved, anſwer any uſeful purpoſe, even if they were true; for it is more difficult to obtain belief

               </gap>ould be but a thing of the moment, and ſeen but by a few; after this, it requires a transfer of faith, from God to man, to believe a miracle upon man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Inſtead therefore of admitting the recitals of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as evidence of any ſyſtem of religion being true, they ought to be conſidered as ſymptoms of its being fabulous. It is necessary to the full and upright character of truth, that it rejects the crutch; and it is conſiſtent with the character of fable, to ſeek the aid that truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Thus much for myſtery and miracle.</p>
            <p>As myſtery and miracle took charge of the paſt and the preſent, prophecy took charge of the future, and rounded the tenſes of faith. It was not ſufficient to know what had been done, but what would be done. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed prophet was the ſuppoſed hiſtorian of times to come; and if he happened, in ſhooting with a long bow of a thouſand years, to ſtrike within a thouſand miles of a mark, the ingenuity of poſterity could make it point blank; and if he happened to be directly wrong; it was only to ſuppoſe, as in the caſe of Jonah and Ninevah, that God had repented himſelf, and changed his mind. What a fool do fabulous ſyſtems of religion make of man!</p>
            <p>IT has been ſhewn in a former part of this work, that the original meaning of the words <hi>prophet</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying</hi> has been changed, and that a prophet, in the ſenſe the word is now uſed, is a creature of modern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; and it is owing to this change in the meaning of the words, that the flights and metaphors of the Jewiſh poets, and phraſes and expreſſions now rendered obſcure by our not being acquainted with the local circumſtances to which they applied at the time they were uſed, have been erected into propheſies, and made to bend to expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations at the will and whimſical conceits of ſectaries, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders, and commentators. Every thing unintelligible
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027458_0056_0FD44042A8A21598"/>
was prophetical, and every thing inſignificant was typical. A blunder would have ſerved for prophecy; and a diſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clout for a type.</p>
            <p>If by a prophet we are to ſuppoſe a man to whom the Almighty communicated ſome event that would take place in future, either there were ſuch men, or there were not. If there were, it is conſiſtent to believe that the event, ſo communicated, would be told in terms that could be underſtood, and not related in ſuch a looſe and obſcure manner as to be out of the comprehenſion of thoſe that heard it, and ſo equivocal as to fit almoſt any circumſtance that might happen afterwards. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving very irreverently of the Almighty to ſuppoſe he would deal in this j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſting manner with mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet all the things called prophecies, in the book called the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, come under this deſcription.</p>
            <p>But it is with prophecy, as it is with miracle. It could not anſwer the purpoſe even if it were real. Thoſe to whom a prophecy ſhould be told, could not tell whether the man propheſied or lied, or whether it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him, or whether he conceited it: and if the thing that the propheſied, or pretended to prophecy, ſhould happen, or ſomething like it among the multiude of things that are daily happening, nobody could again know whether he foreknew it, or gueſſed at it, or whether it was accidental. A prophet, therefore, is a character uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unneceſſary: and the ſafe ſide of the caſe is, to guard againſt being impoſed upon by not giving credit to ſuch relations.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, myſtery, miracle, and prophecy, are appendages that belong to fabulous and not to true religion. They are the means by which ſo many <hi>Lo heres!</hi> and <hi>Lo theres!</hi> have been ſpread about the world, and religion been made into a trade. The ſucceſs of one impoſtor gave encouragement to another, and the quieting ſalvo of doing <hi>ſome</hi> good by keeping up a <hi>pious fraud,</hi> protected them from remorſe.</p>
            <p>Having now extended the ſubject to a greater length than I firſt intended, I ſhall bring it to a cloſe, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting a ſummary from the whole.</p>

Firſt, That the idea or belief of a word of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in print, or in writing or in ſpeech, is inconſiſtent in itſelf for the reaſons already aſſigned. Theſe reaſons, among many others, are the want of a univerſal language; the mutability of language; the errors to which tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſubject; the poſſibility of totally ſuppressing ſuch a word; the probability of altering it, or of fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the whole, and impoſing it upon the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the creation we behold, is the real and ever-exiſting word of God, in which we cannot be deceived. It proclaimeth his power, it demonſtrates his wiſdom, it manifeſts his goodneſs and beneficence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the moral duty of man conſiſts in imitating the moral goodneſs and beneficence of God man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſted in the creation towards all his creatures. That ſeeing, as we daily do, the goodneſs of God to all men, it is an example, calling upon all men to practiſe the ſame towards each other; and conſequently that every thing of perſecution and revenge between man and man, and every thing of cruelty to animals, is a violation of moral duty.</p>
            <p>I trouble not myſelf about the manner of future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. I content myſelf with believing, even to poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conviction, that the power that gave me exiſtence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he pleaſes, eith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with or without this body; and it appears more prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me, that I ſhall continue to exiſt hereafter, than that I ſhould have had exiſtence, as I now have, before that exiſtence began.</p>
            <p>It is certain that, in one point, all nations of the earth and all religions agree. All believe in a God. The things in which they diſagree, are the redundancies annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that belief; and therefore, if ever an univerſal relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſhould prevail, it will not be believing any thing new, but in getting rid of redundancies, and believing as man believed at firſt. Adam, if ever there was ſuch a man, was created a Deiſt; but in the mean time let every man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as he has a right to do, the religion and the worſhip he prefers.</p>
