            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THERE is no principle more congenial to man, than that ardent desire, which he evinces to celebrate those great events, which distinguish the most important and interesting periods in his history. He thus forms certain Epochas, which serve not only to recall to mind the glorious deeds of his ancestry, but which in the midst of those calamities that history every where presents, become so many resting places, where he reposes with joy and exultation. It is this principle, which operating wherever the human race is found, uniformly displays the strongest attachment to whatever is great, generous and noble. Do we consult the records of past ages? We every where find it evinced by some public testimony. We behold it in the savage as well as in the civilized state, though perhaps, under different forms—that sensibility which bursts from the Indian's breast, and shews itself by violent and external marks, is cooly and calmly conveyed from the bosom of the American, refined by the polish of education. So long as this principle is congenial to man,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024537_0004_0FC7B41B8A13CDB0"/>
and truly consistent with the dignity of human nature; so long it clearly discovers the high es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation in which we ought to hold the gift of certain blessings. It fixes upon the mind of posterity an indelible regard for their value; and at the same time, inspires them with the manly resolution of maintaining inviolate, what their fathers perhaps had risqued their all, to establish. But, if this principle ever operate with all its force in the breast of man, you, my countrymen have cause to feel and to confess its fullest influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The unnumbered favors which distinguish this land, demand your sincerest return of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The success with which your labors have been crowned, requires the highest veneration for that event, which dissolved the fetters of slavery, which burst asunder the bonds that connected us to an arbitrary power, and liberated oppressed America. As to myself, permit me to confess, that no subject is more consonant to my dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, than that which this day presents. Born at the period, when the frightful image of tyranny haunted our dwellings; bred at a time, when a just regard to the divine Rights of Man, and the strongest sense of freedom animated every breast, I cherish the sacred impressions of my infancy, I reflect upon them with love and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.—Would to God, I could express the sentiments, which such impressions always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite. But! what language can paint the feelings of the heart! what expression communicate the warmth of patriotic ardor! let those who call themselves Americans pardon the feeble attempt. Let those who can boast the freedom of this
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024537_0005_0FC7B42131057428"/>
Western world, now view with the eye of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, him whose tongue was taught to lisp the language of liberty, whose inclination as well as duty, prompts him to express, if possible, the sentiments of a heart deeply impressed with the importance of this memorable day; a day by which the rights of humanity, and the claims of justice even rescued from the lawless domination of a British tyrant, and the privileges of man asserted—When I behold those who compose this audience; when I stand in the view of youth, of manhood, and of age; and see even the fair daughters of Columbia, gracing this assembly with their presence, can I be unmindful of my situation? can I know the patriotic pulse that beats in each breast and still not feel its sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic influence? every affection that now fills my mind declares it impossible.</p>
            <p>Never did I view the light of this returning Sun, but with eyes that streamed with joy. Never shall its bright beams return, without exciting that expression of gratitude, and that ardor for liberty, which should now glow in the bosom of each virtuous American. To name this day, is to call up every idea that can bring pleasure to the minds of freemen. From this day, as men, we date our happiness, from this day, as a nation, America assumes a rank in the political existence of the world. What friend to liberty, what friend to triumphant vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, what friend to human nature, does not acknowledge this to be a day, the most event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the annals of mankind! let us welcome its glad return. Let each freeborn child of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024537_0006_0FC7B422295FF6F8"/>
Columbia, "Hail to the Sun whose circling ray, revolves once more the happy day, that gave our nation birth." The voice of gratitude, the voice of nature demands it, nor will Americans disobey these pleasing calls. But who among us can behold the delightful prospects,. that are on every side presented to our view, and yet be regardless of the causes that produced them? can the mind of man enjoy what constitutes its true happiness, and not return with a pleasing reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the means from which it sprang? will you, my countrymen, rejoice in the bounties of an indulgent Heaven? Will you behold your national credit acknowledged by the powers of the earth, and see your prosperity rising to eminence at home, without remembering those transactions in your history which gave them birth: Transactions, replete with the noble efforts of infant virtue, struggling against the all desolating force of a full grown despotism, and which kept in suspense the hopes of an anxious world? The face of tyranny looks pale, when they are mentioned, whilst they vibrate sounds ever grateful to the ears of freedom. The splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of British glory no longer dazzles the sight of admiring man, since the rays of American fortitude have eclipsed its brightest lustre.</p>
            <p>When we consider the various passions by which men are governed, and see the oppression under which the human race has groaned in every age, what generous bosom does not heave at the sigh of sorrow! what liberal eye does not meet with the manly tear of pity! the most noble deeds have been too often followed by some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

act. Honors raised upon foundations of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and a happy series of events, have been shaken by the pestiferous blasts of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic ambition, and the same people, who at one time extended the arm of protection, have been seen drawing the sword of oppression. The age of Roman Emperors has been heard of. The age of British Ministers has been seen. No longer let the despots of Eastern cruelty, be mentioned alone. No longer let the decayed volumes of ancient records, be the only reposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of unnatural war. One more in another clime has since appeared. One more second to none, O America, thou hast seen. The crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son car of desolation has marked thy country. The agonizing groans of thy dying heroes, have have been heard from North to South; and the icy hand of death has made his pale figure fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to your eyes. What people so void of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional dignity, so free from every manly disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could direct their unprovoked vengeance upon an infant land! Was it the unfortunate savage of your forests! Was it some name, till then unknown to same? Humanity hides her face: Conviction is alarmed at her own whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; and the ties of consanguinity are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, when truth, with interrupted speech, declares that nation to have been Britain. O Britain! thou name once pleasing to the sons of freedom, why wish to blast their early hopes, and destroy the pillars of thy own greatness? What unfriendly genius could have prompted thy united arms against thy descendants? How oft, with filial readiness, have they obeyed thy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024537_0008_0FC7B4290B9A3AE8"/>
frequent calls! through what scenes of distress and horror have they not passed! What trying exigencies for heroic fortitude, have not they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered for the advancement of thy glory! The savages of America, still wreak their ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less vengeance upon the citizens of this country, who under thy banners, first made them flee their scattered huts. The frozen plains of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada, thawed by the blood of many a bleeding Martyr, will attest the sincere attachment of America to thy interest. Still united with us, Great Britain might have flourished the unrival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mistress of the better half of the globe. Had the wisdom of her Councils, but equalled her thirst for domination, she would not now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust the bitter cup of sorrow, nor feel the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawrels of her brow withering to decay. But the awful moment was at hand, when the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ties of human connection were to be broken, the common rights of the human species sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and the name of Britain cease to be the name of parent. Not content to confine our trade to her shores alone, not satisfyed in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing a system of uninterrupted oppression, in the hour of presumption, she assumed the language even of omnipotence. For one people to claim the right to bind another, "in every case what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever," is an assumption of power, at which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature revolts. Yet this right, Britons claimed—Like the affectionate child loth to quit the once tender embraces of the now suspicious mother, America still wishes to be enfolded within the arms of her parent country. In the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024537_0009_0FC7B4320DA466B0"/>
tone of supplication, she implored her attention, and asked her justice only. But, the haughty Monarch knew it not.—</p>
            <p>"No ray of mercy, beaming from his brow,"</p>
            <p>"No olive branch extended in his hand,"</p>
            <p>Her prayers were answered with threats.—Her petitions, that breathed the language of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileation, were left unopened. O Chatham! Thou friend to Britain and America, how wast thy aged bosom torn with grief, when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the infatuated Council of your country! Not even the eloquence of thy tongue, could stem the impetuous torrent of venal opposition! You saw the Sun of British greatness fast descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from its meridian height! Rest mighty shade! Whatever could be done to prop the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory of a country, has been done by thee. Friends to mankind shall drop a tear upon thy deathless memory, whilst the name of North is mentioned with horror. The storm of war, which had been long threatning in distant thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, now burst in all its fury upon our defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less shores.—'Twas then, that each American felt himself a soldier. 'Twas then, that he who had deeply weighed the justice of his cause, stept forth to defend it. Then was the crisis of our fare—Conducted by the wisdom of that man who—</p>
            <p>'Eripuit Caelo fulmen, Sceptrumque Tyrannis,' and her numerous band of enlightened patriots, America feared not now the bursting storm. Secure in the righteousness of her cause, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidently appealed to Heaven—Her genius called forth her Washington. Soon she beheld the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024537_0010_0FC7B433763AB0C0"/>
of this western sky, enlightened by her brightest luminary. O mighty chief! At the sound of whose name, freedom smiles and proud oppression starts; let the kindling gratitude of a youthful breast, venture to address thee. If it be impossible to add new lustre to thy fame, at least let him view thee placed upon the summit of greatness by the united voice of a free people. Let him behold in thee, the concentered virtues of an Aristides, a Fabius and a Solon. Already has the world called thee friend. Already has a nation called thee father—Thy deeds shall be the theme for future ages. The unerring genius of history shall shew in unadorned truth, the characters of that host of heroes who have left us free. Yes, those characters shall be held forth as the great exemplars for generations yet unborn. Each future father, anxious for the promising virtues of his son, shall not mention the celebrated names that adorn the bright ages of Greece and Rome; but leading him, where the lively pencil has animated the breathing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vass, shall say to him,—Behold my Son, the Heroes of America—Behold the renowned cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters who flourished in the eighteenth century, who first taught mankind their rights, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired the resolution to vindicate them.—These are the men who died in establishing liberty upon its firmest basis. Let these be your examples. See where the gallant Warren falls, an early vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim to the arms of Britain; see how he smiles even in the agonies of death, still exhorting his countrymen to prefer his fate to an ignominious slavery. Remember, he first taught America,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024537_0011_0FC7B434E72D6F28"/>
tho' almost destitute of the means, to oppose the rapid strides of an ungrateful people. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he lived the Patriot, and died the Hero.—Behold where the virtuous, the intrepid Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery lies. See the pale youth who falls by his side. 'Tis the generous Macpherson, whose rising soul fired by Montgomery's bright exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, could not survive his death. But seest thou that image robed in white, bending over some falling soldier! 'Tis victory, in whose arms, Hackemer has fainted. She is now entwining his brows with wreaths of laurel. My Son, should age possess thee, before some just cause calls forth the declining vigor of thy arm; let the noble example of Wooster be thy guide. The illustrious Chief covered over with wounds, after having repulsed the foe, falls in his old age. But behold that circle of men suspended in anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention—'Tis the celebrated Council of America, before whom their patriot General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs his commission.—This great man after having expelled the enemies of his country, and saved a fallen people, now returns the avenging sword, and gives to the world the noblest exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Behold him now no longer the commander of armies, but the private citizen. Heroic man! Let thy example teach the universe, that it is not men, but the laws which command.—</p>
            <p>This must be the language of ages to come. Rising generations will celebrate the fame and copy the virtues of those heroes who have made the Rights of Man their care. In the astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their souls, they will appeal to you, ye venerable fathers, whose sons have fought and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024537_0012_0FC7B4411BB76DB0"/>
died in the cause of America, and ask, why they sacrificed every possession, but virtue? what powerful motive could induce them to leave that friendly circle, where aged experience and matured judgment, might soon have formed their minds to greatness? What unusual cause could prompt them to abandon the budding fields of science, and leave the secrets of nature just opening to their view? was it mad ambition, or a thirst for power? Was it the unbridled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of youthful impetuosity, or a desire to trample upon the privileges of their fellow creatures? Say ye widows and ye orphans, whose tears have so often attested the irreparable loss of husbands, fathers, sons and brothers, why were ye torn from those most dear? Why were all those tender charities that attend domestic ease fortaken? Why did not the fondling of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der infant and the caresses of the affectionate wife, prevent the long farewell? What cause could compel them to exchange the chearful sounds of peace and harmony, for the cruelties of war and the dreadful clash of arms? Was it the gratification of one selfish passion? Was it the influence of one unmanly thought? O na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! thou whose language carries the stamp of truth, make the answer—Liberty, that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, that equal, that sacred Right of Man was violated, and the lovers of the human race slept forth for its protection—They knew, that with<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> liberty a nation was destitute of its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest privilege. They knew, that liberty adds energy to the natural imbecility of man, and gives a liberal spring to the abilities of the mind,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024537_0013_0FC7B4429FD1FB18"/>
whilst slavery relaxes the vigor of human nature, contracts the sphere of all noble exertion, and clouds the efforts of the brightest reason; that liberty gives rise to the most distinguishing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that adorn our characters, whilst slavery chills every warm and generous emotion of the human heart: they knew, that liberty was a friend to mankind wherever found, whilst slavery strikes, with equal terror the black of Africa, the white of Europe and the red of America: that liberty is the gift of God, whilst slavery is the hedious monster of degenerate man. Shall we then wonder that those memorable men died for liberty in opposition to slavery? in such a cause, death had no terrors. They met it with a smile. They gave you liberty and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Go mighty warriors! whilst your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories are adored on earth receive in Heaven a reward for that greatness which man cannot compensate. Britons, farewell! no longer does America bend at your nod. If an ignorance of the common Rights of Man, prompted you to attempt the subjection of this new world, we pity your condition. If ambition was the cause, we despise the motive. As men, we shall ever remember you are such; but as Americans we cannot forget the part you have acted as Britons.</p>
            <p>When we consider the establishment of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican independence, our minds are filled with consequences the most important that ever inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested the feelings of Man. It does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the happiness of these United States alone, the people of any particular country, or single nation—It's influence is not confined to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024537_0014_0FC7B443F44AD740"/>
the shores of America, but extends to the most distant regions of the earth. In the opinions of mankind, a most striking change is already seen. Thousands of pens, thousands of tongues have already appeared the powerful advocates of the Rights of Man; and <hi>"ten thousands of swords have leaped from their scabbards to avenge</hi> the long insulted dignity of liberty, that Heavenly <hi>"Queen,"</hi> which first <hi>"lighted on this"</hi> new <hi>"orb."</hi> It was here that <hi>"delightful vision"</hi> first <hi>"appeared glittering like the morning star, full of life and splendor and joy—Oh! what a revolution! and what an heart must I have, to contemplate without emotion that elevation"</hi> of liberty, <hi>"and that fall"</hi> of despotism. If firmness conducted thy arms, America, wisdom has directed thy Councils. If fortitude graced the actions of thy heroes, prudence has marked the conduct of thy Statesmen.</p>
            <p>If the havoc of war, desolated the face of thy country, the Cornu Copia of peace has returned. Where shall we find a revolution equal to that in America? whether we consider the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which have attended, and will attend it, or the manner in which it was effected? If we ask why America displayed so singular an example of greatness, the reason must be traced in the particular characteristics that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish her as a nation. The state of property under the particular circumstances that it appears in this country, the want of Titles, of Nobility, fit baubles for children, and which originated whilst the human mind, was in a state of infancy, together with that diffusion of general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024537_0015_0FC7B445A8E48568"/>
which distinguishes the present age; all these may be considered as the causes which produced that freedom, which has always marked the sentiments of its citizens—If we consult antiquity, we are presented with acts of cruelty, and exertions of ambition, that strike the soul with horror. We see perhaps a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary change in affairs, effected by some powerful individual, or by the unsteady temper of the fickle multitude—This continues, 'till another designing head appears, destroys the former plan, and erects one of his own, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the foundation of slavery. Shall these changes be compared with the American revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution? Shall the confusion that arises from the folly and ambition of wicked men, be equal to the regularity, that springs from the united ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of reason and virtue? No! Americans, you stand alone, an example of infant greatness to the world. You rise an exception to the general tendency of mankind. You shew, that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is founded in the reason, and not in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of men, that civil liberty rests in the hands of the people, and not on the smile or frown of individuals. The principles of your government have received your calm and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate assent. From it, you have banished the pomp of Majesty, and the pride of bigotted ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Toleration, that fairest daughter of Heaven, is received in America, and pours forth the fulness of happiness on our land. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressing cries of the cruel rack that penetrate the feeling soul, and pervert affrighted reason, are not heard in our country. Those torrents
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024537_0016_0FC7B44AEF80D3E0"/>
of innocent blood that flowed from the scaffold, feared by the hands of tyranny, do not here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the gentle current of religious bliss. The understanding freely consults its own dictates, and feels no restraint in declaring them—O for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate people! thrice happy nation! who in the height of all earthly bliss, by thy example nobly expands the bosom of humanity, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously diffuses a knowledge of the Rights of Man. Still let the elevated task be thine. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you are men. Exert yourselves in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seminating that liberty, so dearly gained, for the noblest purpose, the happiness of man. Be it yours to regenerate the old world. Already may we welcome the happy aera, that now begins to dawn in the regions of Europe. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, with joy, the old world emerging from that dark abyss of misery, into which the cruel hand of despotism had plunged it. The thick gloom of superstition, which has overshadowed the minds of man for so many ages, begins at length to retire before the piercing rays of truth. Already does the liberal Frenchman, animated by the Sun of this Western hemisphere, keep holy the day, he left his native land to cross the atlantic, a soldier in the cause of freedom. Fayette! formed after natures favorite plan, may the object of thy early virtues be cherished by thy countrymen; may every gift, that Heaven can bestow upon a generous people, be enjoyed by Frenchmen. Names begin to yield to things. The sound of King, that synonimous term for the cause of human misery,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024537_0017_0FC7B4542119E080"/>
no longer conveys the idea of divinity. Even the ignorance of those, whose mighty heads can support golden crowns, now teaches them, they are no more than man. The gorgeous palaces, reared upon the ruins of virtue, and supported by the distresses of innocence, begin to totter. Those insects, that too long have crawled upon them, and lived on the vitals of man, begin to loose their hold! soon shall they fall upon their native earth, neglected and despised.</p>
            <p>Americans! be wise: liberty attempered only with those restraints, which the social state re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, now sheds its brightest lustre upon you. Be mindful of yourselves. The fate of fallen states rests before you. The exercise of reason, a constant recurrence to fundamental principles, a veneration for those sacred rights, which this day recalls to mind, will forever establish our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved republic upon a foundation, which cannot be shaken.</p>
            <p>Ye sons of American Statesmen and heroes, who now ardently pursue the path of science, and trace the wonders of all powerful nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the important part you are soon to act upon the grand theatre of the world. At this early period of life, let the strong foundation be laid—Let the hand of science form the rising virtues of the soul. Let the mild precepts of Philosophy implant deeply in your breasts, whatever is great, lovely, elevated, or noble in the character of man. Learn to venerate the rights of others, and to protect your own. Thus shall you shine the brightest ornaments of that temple, which your fathers have erected,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024537_0018_0FC7B4552C48F1D0"/>
thus shall you live the protectors of virtue, and the guardians of the Rights of Man; and when the curtain of separation shall fall, be received into the bosom of that father, with whom me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit meets its reward.</p>
