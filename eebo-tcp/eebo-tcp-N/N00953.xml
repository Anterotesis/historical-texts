            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I needed not thoſe word to excuſe me, for they were more then I was oblidged to have ſaid but what I ſaid, was true both in ſaying ſo (and I have ſearch'd divers other, places) &amp; alſo in ſaying it was not in the place cited in the <hi>margent,</hi> though <hi>G.

I knew not the leaſt of it.</p>
            <p>Well, he further ſaith, Malice it <hi>ſelf cannot fix it on the Eight</hi> Miniſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, how came <hi>D. L.</hi> and he to do it then? For t'was from them I had it, neither will that help him out to ſay, he ſaid, <hi>Moſt of thoſe Quotations are Atteſted with near 800 more in the</hi> 3d. and 4th. Narrative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> What is that to the purpoſe? For what could be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the words (thoſe Quotations) but thoſe in that <hi>Sheet</hi> he ſaid they had <hi>Atteſted?</hi> So let it be where or when it will, yet it was theſe in that <hi>Sheet</hi> that <hi>G.

            </p>
            <p>Again, I find, that in Page 22, of the fourth <hi>Narrative,</hi> as alſo in <hi>G.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Pretty <hi>Logick</hi> again! G. K. ſays himſelf, in his own caſe, that one of our own Profeſſion told him, they were preparing a <hi>Gibbet</hi> for him; therefore they would have made his crime <hi>Capital,</hi> viz. ſuch as deſerves <hi>Death,</hi> as he himſelf conſtrues it, Ibid: when poſſibly, if the Truth of the matter were known, the Perſon that told him ſo, was no <hi>Quaker;</hi> but a great favourer of him: &amp; that Perſon only told him ſo in Waggery, being <hi>Ben Waller,</hi> now of <hi>Burlington;</hi> for ſo I have been informed it was.</p>
            <p>Well he proceeds, and tells pa. 43. 44. how he hath enquired at the ableſt <hi>Lawyers</hi> here, (viz.) thoſe recommended to him as the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt whether the <hi>Corporal Puniſhment</hi> in the ſaid <hi>Act,</hi> might not by the Letter of the <hi>Law</hi> be conſtrued, to extend to <hi>Death,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Death</hi> was but a <hi>Corporal Puniſhment? &amp;c.</hi> and, ſays he, <q>the ſaid <hi>Lawyers</hi> have Unanimouſly Anſwer'd me, that tho' they could not <hi>Hang</hi> me by Law, yet they could, if it was their will, cauſe to <hi>Whip</hi> me to <hi>Death:</hi> for it <hi>Whipping</hi> be the <hi>Corporal Puniſhment</hi> intended by the Law, there is no <hi>Limitation,</hi> as to the <hi>Number,</hi> or the ſeverity of <hi>Laſhes.</hi>

            <p>Well he ſays, <hi>Coll Markham,</hi> then Deputy <hi>Governour, Andrew Robinſon,</hi> and other, <hi>Juſtice,</hi> ſign'd a publick Writing, wherein they fully cleared him of all things the <hi>Quaker Magiſtrates</hi>
