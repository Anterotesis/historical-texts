            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT may perhaps ſeem ſtrange to ſlight conſideration, that theſe LETTERS which have already paſſed through all <hi>America,</hi> ſhould now a ſecond time be produced before the Public in their preſent form. But a little further reflection will ſhew the UTILITY of this WORK. The ſacred cauſe of liberty is of too great conſequence, and the neceſſity of freedom for the ſecurity of human happineſs too obvious, not to render every precaution wiſe, that tends to prevent the introduction of ſlavery. Notwithſtanding therefore, theſe letters have been already publiſhed, yet here, they have been ſeen only in the Gazettes, which, from the incertainty of their diſperſion, and the length of time paſſing between the reception of newſpapers in the country, may probably have prevented much of the benefit to be derived from a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective, uninterrupted view of the manly reaſoning, the timely information, and the true conſtitutional principles of liberty with which theſe letters every where abound. Whoever conſiders again that the nature of men in authority is inclined rather to commit two errors than to retract one<note n="*" place="bottom">Clarendon's Hiſtory of the Rebellion.</note>, will not be ſurpriſed to ſee the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> followed by a Bill of Right, declaring the power of Parliament to bind us in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; and this act followed again by another, impoſing a duty on paper, paint, glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> imported into theſe colonies. But however unbounded may be the wiſh of power to extend itſelf, however unwilling it may be to acknowledge miſtakes, 'tis ſurely the duty of every wiſe and worthy <hi>American,</hi> who at once wiſhes the proſperity of the Mother country and the colonies, to point out all invaſions of the public liberty, and to ſhew the proper methods of obtaining redreſs. This has been done by the Authors of the following LETTERS with a force and ſpirit becoming freemen, <hi>Engliſh</hi> freemen, contending for our juſt and legal poſſeſſion of property and freedom. A poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion that has its foundation on the cleareſt principles of the law of nature, the moſt evident declarations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution, the plaineſt contract made between the Crown and our forefathers, and all theſe ſealed and ſanctified by the uſage of near
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:011239_0003_0F86794448401B38"/>
two hundred years. <hi>American</hi> rights thus reſting on the beſt and ſtrongeſt ground, it behoves all her inhabitants with united heads, hearts, and hands, to guard the ſacred depoſit committed by their fathers to their care, as well to bleſs poſterity as to ſecure the happineſs of the preſent generation. In vain 'tis for ſome few (and very few I hope they are) who, governed either by baſe principles of fear, or led by vile hopes of gain, the reward of proſtituted virtue, to ſay, "your rights are indeed invaded, but <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is too ſtrong. What can we do againſt ſuperior ſtrength?" Let theſe evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning men remember what the higheſt authority has told us, "that the race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong." And if inſpiration needed to receive aſſiſtance from genius, <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> ſays, "thrice is he armed that has his quarrel juſt, and he but naked, tho' lock'd up in ſteel, whoſe conſcience, with injuſtice, is oppreſſed." Hiſtory alſo informs us, that <hi>Xerxes</hi> with his armed millions could not accompliſh his purpoſe of reducing to ſlavery the much weaker but free States of <hi>Greece.</hi> Three hundred brave men at <hi>Thermophyl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In later times we ſee the States of <hi>Holland</hi> free, and the generous <hi>Corſicans</hi> likely to be ſo, although the far greater powers of <hi>Spain, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> have at different periods combined to enſlave theſe noble nations.</p>
            <p>THE truth is, that the great Author of nature has created nothing in vain, and having with the life of man joined liberty, the virtuous enjoyment and free poſſeſſion of property honeſtly gained, has undoubtedly furniſhed all nations with the means of defending their natural rights, if they have but wiſdom and fortitude to make the proper uſe of ſuch means. In this inſtance we find ourſelves three thouſand miles removed from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> we poſſeſs a country abounding with woods in all parts, and in many with mountains of difficult and dangerous acceſs. The eaſe with which the ſtaple colonies could put an entire ſtop to the exportation of their commodities, and the peaceable but vital injury that this would convey to thoſe who might inſiſt on oppreſſing them, are truths ſo plain as to require no further animadverſion. <hi>Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>um ſapienti ſat eſt.</hi> The nature of the climate, the ſoil, and its various produce, point out the eaſe and extent with which manufactures may be conducted here. Theſe things are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as a proof of what is above aſſerted, that the bountiful Author of nature has furniſhed his creatures with the means of ſecuring their proper rights, and that the event depends much upon their own wiſe and brave determinations. A benevolent mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, cannot but lament that either ambition, avarice, or ill-placed reſentment, ſhould ever be ſo exerciſed as to force men into the inveſtigation of thoſe methods by whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> they may be ſecured from the operation of theſe bad paſſions. For certain it is, that there is nothing more becoming to human nature than well ordered government, or more valuable than liberty: How ignominious then muſt his conduct be who turns the firſt into confuſion, and the latter into ſlavery? But whatever may be the opinion, or the deſign of a rapacious ill-adviſed Miniſter, the <hi>Americans</hi> have in their view this happy proſpect; that the people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> are generous and brave, they know the value of liberty, becauſe they have purchaſed that knowledge with much of their blood:
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:011239_0003_0F86794448401B38"/>
and therefore they cannot but eſteem us their children for venerating the good old cauſe which they themſelves have contended for in many a well-fought field. It is really wonderful that this unhappy diſpute between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her colonies ſhould ever have exiſted, when a moment's retroſpection ſhews the Mother country for near two centuries exerciſing legiſlative authority here without complaint, while ſhe abſtained from that ſingle deſtructive claim of taking our money from us without the conſent of our repreſentatives. The exerciſe of which claim, would indeed reduce <hi>America,</hi> to a ſtate of ſlavery more deplorable and more ignominious than has ever yet been known in the world. But to what purpoſe this ſhould be deſired is ſtill more amazing, when <hi>Britain</hi> from her excluſive trade to theſe colonies, and from the manner in which ſhe tied up our manufacturing hands, not only received the entire produce of the lands and labour of theſe countries, but has beſides involved the people here in a heavy debt, which agriculture, without arts, and a trade ſo confined, will probably never pay. Mr. <hi>Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> it ſeems had the honour of deviſing this new ſyſtem of <hi>American</hi> policy.</p>

In my opinion they acted imprudently, conſidering all circumſtances, in not complying ſo far as would have given ſatisfaction, as ſeveral colonies did: But my diſlike of their conduct in that inſtance, has not blinded me ſo much, that I cannot plainly perceive, that they have been puniſhed in a manner pernicious to <hi>American</hi> freedom, and juſtly alarming to all the colonies.</p>
                        <p>IF the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament has a legal authority to iſſue an order, that we ſhall furniſh a ſingle article for the troops here, and to compel obedience to <hi>that</hi> order, they have the ſame right to iſſue an order for us to ſupply thoſe troops with arms, cloaths, and every neceſſary; and to compel obedience to <hi>that</hi> order alſo; in ſhort, to lay <hi>any burthens</hi> they pleaſe upon us. What is this but <hi>taxing</hi> us at a <hi>certain ſum,</hi> and leaving to us only the <hi>manner</hi> of raiſing it? How is this mode more tolerable than the <hi>Stamp-Act?</hi> Would that act have appeared more pleaſing to <hi>Americans,</hi> if being ordered thereby to raiſe the ſum total of the taxes, the mighty privilege had been left to them, of ſaying how much ſhould be paid for an inſtrument of writing on paper, and how much for another on parchment?</p>
                        <p>AN act of Parliament, commanding us to do a certain thing, if it has any validity, is a <hi>tax</hi> upon us for the expence that accrues in complying with it; and for this reaſon, I believe, every colony on the continent, that choſe to give a mark of their reſpect for <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in complying with the act relating to the troops, cautiouſly avoided the mention of that act, leſt their conduct ſhould be attributed to its ſuppoſed obligation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="3" facs="unknown:011239_0005_0F8679457B01C620"/>
THE matter being thus ſtated, the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> either had, or had not, a right to refuſe ſubmiſſion to that act. If they had, and I imagine no <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> will ſay they had not, then the Parliament had <hi>no right</hi> to compel them to execute it. If they had not <hi>this right,</hi> they had <hi>no right</hi> to puniſh them for not executing it; and therefore <hi>no right</hi> to ſuſpend their legiſlation, which is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In fact, if the people of <hi>New-York</hi> cannot be legally texed but by their own repreſentatives, they cannot be legally deprived of the privilege of legiſlation, only for inſiſting on that excluſive privilege of taxation. If they may be legally deprived in ſuch a caſe, of the privilege of legiſlation, why may they not, with equal reaſon, be deprived of every other privilege? Or why may not every colony be treated in the ſame manner, when any of them ſhall dare to deny their aſſent to any impoſitions, that ſhall be directed? Or what ſignifies the repeal of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> if theſe colonies are to loſe their <hi>other</hi> privileges, by not tamely ſurrendering <hi>that</hi> of taxation?</p>
                        <p>THERE is one conſideration ariſing from this ſuſpenſion, which is not generally attended to, but ſhews its importance very clearly. It was not <hi>neceſſary</hi> that this ſuſpenſion ſhould be cauſed by an act of Parliament. The Crown might have reſtrained the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> even from calling the Aſſembly together, by its prerogative in the Royal governments. This ſtep, I ſuppoſe, would have been taken, if the conduct of the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York</hi> had been regarded as an act of diſobedience <hi>to the Crown alone:</hi> but it is regarded as an act of<note n="*" place="bottom">See the act of ſuſpenſion.</note> "diſobedience to the authority of the <hi>Britiſh legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>" This gives the ſuſpenſion a conſequence vaſtly more affecting. It is a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary aſſertion of the <hi>ſupreme authority</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> legiſlature over theſe colonies, in <hi>the point of taxation,</hi> and is intended to COMPEL <hi>New-York</hi> into a ſubmiſſion to that authority. It ſeems therefore to me as much a violation of the liberties of the people of that province, and conſequently of all thoſe colonies, as if the Parliament had ſent a number of regiments to be quartered upon them till they ſhould comply. For it is evident, that the ſuſpenſion is meant as a <hi>compulſion;</hi> and the <hi>method</hi> of compelling is totally indifferent. It is indeed probable, that the ſight of red coats, and the hearing of drums, would have been moſt alarming; becauſe people are generally more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by their eyes and ears, than by their reaſon. But whoever ſeriouſly conſiders the matter, muſt perceive, that a dreadful ſtroke is aimed at the liberty of theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. I ſay, of theſe colonies; for the cauſe of <hi>one</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>all.</hi> If the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may lawfully deprive <hi>New-York</hi> of any of <hi>her</hi> rights, it may deprive any, or all the other colonies of <hi>their</hi> rights; and nothing can poſſibly ſo much encourage ſuch attempts, as a mutual inattention to the intereſts of each other. <hi>To divide, and thus to deſtroy,</hi> is the firſt political maxim in attacking thoſe, who are powerful by their union. He certainly is not a wiſe man, who folds his arms, and repoſes himſelf at home, viewing, with unconcern, the flames that have invaded his neighbour's houſe, without uſing any endeavours to extinguiſh them. When Mr. <hi>Hampden'</hi>s ſhip-money cauſe, for <hi>Three Shillings and Four Pence,</hi> was tried, all the people of <hi>England,</hi> with anxious expectation, intereſted themſelves in the important deciſion; and when the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011239_0006_0F8679469023BE90"/>
ſlighteſt point, touching the freedom of <hi>one</hi> colony, is agitated, I earneſtly wiſh, that <hi>all the reſt</hi> may, with equal ardour, ſupport their ſiſter. Very much may be ſaid on this ſubject; but I hope, more at preſent is unneceſſary.</p>
                        <p>WITH concern I have obſerved, that two Aſſemblies of this province have ſat and adjourned, without taking any notice of this act. It may perhaps be aſked, what would have been proper for them to do? I am by no means fond of inflammatory meaſures; I deteſt them. I ſhould be ſorry that any thing ſhould be done, which might juſtly diſpleaſe our Sovereign, or our Mother country: But a firm, modeſt exertion of a free ſpirit, ſhould never be wanting on public occaſions. It appears to me, that it would have been ſufficient for the Aſſembly, to have ordered our agents to repreſent to the King's Miniſters, their ſenſe of the ſuſpending act, and to pray for its repeal. Thus we ſhould have borne our teſtimony againſt it; and might therefore reaſonably expect that, on a like occaſion, we might receive the ſame aſſiſtance from the other colonies.</p>

                        <p>THERE is another late act of Parliament, which appears to me to be unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional, and as deſtructive to the liberty of theſe colonies, as that mentioned in my laſt letter; that is, the act for granting the duties on paper, glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>THE Parliament unqueſtionably poſſeſſes a legal authority to <hi>regulate</hi> the trade of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and all her colonies. Such an authority is eſſential to the relation between a Mother country and her colonies; and neceſſary for the common good of all. He, who conſiders theſe provinces as ſtates diſtinct from the <hi>Britiſh empire,</hi> has very ſlender notions of <hi>juſtice,</hi> or of their <hi>intereſts.</hi> We are but parts of a <hi>whole;</hi> and therefore there muſt exiſt a power ſomewhere, to preſide, and preſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection in due order.

                           <hi>All before,</hi> are calculated to regulate trade, and preſerve or promote a mutually beneficial intercourſe between the ſeveral conſtituent parts of the empire; and though many of them impoſed duties on trade, yet thoſe duties were always impoſed <hi>with deſign</hi> to reſtrain the commerce of one part, that was injurious to another, and thus to promote the general welfare. The raising a revenue thereby was never intended. Thus the King, by his Judges in his courts of juſtice, impoſes fines,

which all together amount to a very conſiderable ſum, and contribute to the ſupport of government: But this is merely a conſequence ariſing from reſtrictions, that only meant to keep peace, and prevent confuſion; and ſurely a man would argue very looſely, who ſhould conclude from hence, that the King has a right to levy money in general upon his ſubjects. Never did the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, till the period abovementioned, think of impoſing duties in <hi>America, for the purpoſe of raiſing a revenue.</hi> Mr. <hi>Grenville</hi> firſt introduced this language, in the preamble to the 4th of <hi>George</hi> III.

                        <p>THE laſt act, granting duties upon paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> carefully purſues theſe modern pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents.

                           </note>; and a moſt dangerous innovation. It may perhaps be objected, that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has a right to lay what duties ſhe pleaſes upon her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports<note n="†" place="bottom">Some people think that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has the ſame right to impoſe duties on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to theſe colonies, as on the exports to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal, &amp;c.</hi> Such perſons attend ſo much to the idea of exportation, that they entirely drop <hi>that of the connection between the Mother country and her colonies.</hi> If <hi>Great-Britain</hi> had always claimed, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed an authority to compel <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> to import manufactures from her only, the caſes would be parallel: But as ſhe never pretended to ſuch a right, they are at liberty to get them where they pleaſe; and if they chuſe to take them from her, rather than from other nations, they voluntarily conſent to pay the duties impoſed on them.</note>, and it makes no difference to us, whether they are paid here or there.</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer. Theſe colonies require many things for their uſe, which the laws of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> prohibit them from getting any where but from her. Such are paper and glaſs.</p>
                        <p>THAT we may legally be bound to pay any <hi>general</hi> duties on theſe commodities, relative to the regulation of trade, is granted; but we being <hi>obliged by her laws</hi> to take them from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> any <hi>ſpecial</hi> duties impoſed on their exportation <hi>to us only,

with intention to raiſe a revenue from us only,</hi> are as much <hi>taxes</hi> upon us, as thoſe impoſed by the <hi>Stamp-Act.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHAT is the difference in <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> whether the ſame ſum is raiſed upon us by the rates mentioned in the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> on the <hi>uſe</hi> of paper, or by theſe duties, on the <hi>importation</hi> of it. It is only the edition of a former book, ſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>IT ſignifies nothing to us, whether they are to be paid here or there. Had the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> directed, that all the paper ſhould be landed at <hi>Floriad,</hi> and the duties paid there, before it was brought to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies, would the act have raiſed leſs money upon us, or have been leſs deſtructive of our rights? By no means: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>or as we were under a neceſſity of uſing the paper, we ſhould have been under the neceſſity of paying the duties. Thus, in the preſent caſe, a like <hi>neceſſity</hi> will ſubject us, if this act continues in force, to the payment of the duties now impoſed.</p>
                        <p>WHY was the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> then ſo pernicious to freedom? It did not enact, that every man in the colonies <hi>ſhould</hi> buy a certain quantity of paper—No: It only directed, that no inſtrument of writing ſhould be valid in law, if not made on ſtamped paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE makers of that act knew full well, that the confuſions that would ariſe from the diſuſe of writings, would <hi>compel</hi> the colonies to uſe the ſtamped paper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to pay the taxes impoſed. For this reaſon the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> was ſaid to be a law <hi>that would execute itſelf.</hi> For the very ſame reaſon, the laſt act of Parliament, if it is granted to have any force here, <hi>will execute itſelf,</hi> and will be attended with the very ſame conſequences to <hi>American</hi> liberty.</p>
                        <p>SOME perſons perhaps may ſay, that this act lays us under no neceſſity to pay the duties impoſed, becauſe we may ourſelves manufacture the articles on which they are laid; whereas by the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> no inſtrument of writing could be good, unleſs made on <hi>Britiſh</hi> paper and that too ſtamped.</p>
                        <p>SUCH an objection amounts to no more than this, that the injury reſulting to theſe colonies, from the total diſuſe of <hi>Britiſh</hi> paper and glaſs, will not be <hi>ſo afflicting</hi> as that which would have reſulted from the total diſuſe of writing among them; for by that means even the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> might have been eluded. Why then was it univerſally deteſted by them as ſlavery itſelf? Becauſe it preſented to theſe devoted provinces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a choice<note n="*" place="bottom">Either the <hi>diſuſe</hi> of writing, or the payment of <hi>taxes</hi> impoſed by others <hi>without our conſent.</hi>
                           </note> of calamities, imbittered by indignities, each of which it was unworthy of freemen to bear. But is no injury a violation of right but the <hi>greateſt</hi> injury? If the eluding the payment of the taxes impoſed by the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> would have ſubjected us to a more dreadful inconvenience, than the eluding the payment of thoſe impoſed by the late act; does it therefore follow, that the laſt is <hi>no violation</hi> of our rights, though it is calculated for the ſame purpoſe the other was, that is, <hi>to raiſe money upon us, without our conſent?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS would be making <hi>right</hi> to conſiſt, not in an exemption from <hi>injury,</hi> but from a certain <hi>degree of injury.</hi>

BUT the objectors may further ſay, that we ſhall ſuffer no injury at all by the diſuſe of <hi>Britiſh</hi> paper and glaſs. We might not, if we could make as much as we want. But can any man, acquainted with <hi>America,</hi> believe this poſſible? I am told there are but two or three <hi>Glaſs-Houſes</hi> on this continent, and but very few <hi>Paper-Mills;</hi> and ſuppoſe more ſhould be erected, a long courſe of years muſt clapſe, before they can be brought to perfection. This continent is a country of planters, farmers, and fiſhermen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not of manufacturers. The difficulty of eſtabliſhing particular manufactures in ſuch a country, is almoſt inſuperable. For one manufacture is connected with others in ſuch a manner, that it may be ſaid to be impoſſible to eſtabliſh one or two, without eſtabliſhing ſeveral others. The experience of many nations may convince us of this truth.</p>
                        <p>INEXPRESSIBLE therefore muſt be our diſtreſſes in evading the late acts, by the diſuſe of <hi>Britiſh</hi> paper and glaſs. Nor will this be the extent of our misfortune, if we admit the legality of that act.</p>
                        <p>GREAT-BRITAIN has prohibited the manufacturing <hi>iron</hi> and <hi>ſteel</hi> in theſe colonies, without any objection being made to her <hi>right</hi> of doing it. The <hi>like</hi> right ſhe muſt have to prohibit any other manufacture among us. Thus ſhe is poſſeſſed of an undiſputed <hi>precedent</hi> on that point. This auhtority, ſhe will ſay, is founded on the <hi>original inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of ſettling theſe colonies; that is, that ſhe ſhould manufacture for them, and that they ſhould ſupply her with materials. The <hi>equity</hi> of this policy, ſhe will alſo ſay, has been univerſally acknowledged by the colonies, who never have made the leaſt objection to ſtatutes for that purpoſe; and will further appear by the <hi>mutual benefits</hi> flowing from this uſage, ever ſince the ſettlement of theſe colonies.</p>
                        <p>OUR great advocate, Mr. <hi>Pitt,</hi> in his ſpeeches on the debate concerning the repeal of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> acknowledged, that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> could reſtrain our manufactures. His words are theſe—"This kingdom, as the ſupreme governing and legiſlative power, has <hi>always</hi> bound the colonies by her regulations and <hi>reſtrictions</hi> in trade, in navigation, in <hi>manufactures</hi>—in every thing, <hi>except that of taking their money out of their pockets, without their conſent.</hi>" Again he ſays, "We may bind their trade, <hi>confine their manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,</hi> and exerciſe every power whatever, <hi>except that of taking their money out of their pockets, without their conſent.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>HERE then, my dear countrymen, <hi>rouſe</hi> yourſelves, and behold the ruin hanging over your heads. If you ONCE admit, that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> may lay duties upon her exportations to us, <hi>for the purpoſe of levying money on us only,</hi> ſhe then will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to lay thoſe duties on the articles which ſhe prohibits us to manufacture—and the tragedy of <hi>American</hi> liberty is finiſhed. We have been prohibited from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing manufactures, in all caſes, any where but from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> (excepting linens, which we are permitted to import directly from <hi>Ireland.</hi>) We have been prohibited, in ſome caſes, from manufacturing for ourſelves; and may be prohibited in others. We are therefore exactly in the ſituation of a city beſieged, which is ſurrounded by the works of the beſiegers in every part <hi>but one.</hi> If <hi>that</hi> is cloſed up, no ſtep can be taken, <hi>but to ſurrender at diſcretion.</hi> If <hi>Great-Britain</hi> can order us to come to her for neceſſaries we want, and can order us to pay what taxes ſhe pleaſes before we take them

away, or when we land them here, we are as abject ſlaves as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> can ſhew in wooden ſhoes, and with uncombed hair<note n="*" place="bottom">The peaſants of <hi>France</hi> wear wooden ſhoes; and the vaſſals of <hi>Poland</hi> are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for matted hair, which never can be combed.</note>.</p>
                        <p>PERHAPS the nature of the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of dependant ſtates, cauſed by the policy of a governing one, for her own benefit, may be elucidated by a fact mentioned in hiſtory. When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were poſſeſſed of the iſland of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> they made a decree, that the <hi>Sardinians</hi> ſhould not raiſe <hi>corn,</hi> nor get it any other way than from the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi> Then, by impoſing any duties they would upon it, they drained from the miſerable <hi>Sardinians</hi> any ſums they pleaſed; and whenever that oppreſſed people made the leaſt movement to aſſert their liberty, their tyrants ſtarved them to death or ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This may be called the moſt perfect kind of political neceſſity.</p>
                        <p>FROM what has been ſaid, I think this uncontrovertible concluſion may be deduced, that when a ruling ſtate obliges a dependant ſtate to take certain commodities from her alone, it is implied in the nature of that obligation; is eſſentially requiſite to give it the leaſt degree of juſtice; and is inſeparably united with it, in order to preſerve any ſhare of freedom to the dependant ſtate; <hi>that thoſe commodities ſhould never be loaded with duties, for the ſole purpoſe of levying money on the dependant ſtate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>UPON the whole, the ſingle queſtion is, whether the Parliament can legally impoſe duties to be paid by <hi>the people of theſe colonies only, for the ſole purpoſe of raiſing a revenue, on commodities which ſhe obliges us to take from her alone,</hi> or, in other words, whether the Parliament can legally take money out of our pockets, without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.

I AM no further concerned in any thing affecting <hi>America,</hi> than any one of you; and when liberty leaves it, I can quit it much more conveniently than moſt of you: But while Divine Providence that gave me exiſtence in a land of freedom, permits my head to think, my lips to ſpeak, and my hand to move, I ſhall ſo highly and gratefully value the bleſſing received, as to take care, that my ſilence and inactivity ſhall not give my implied aſſent to any act, degrading my brethren and myſelf from the birthright, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Heaven itſelf <hi>"hath made us free</hi>

                        <p>SORRY I am to learn, that there are ſome few perſons, who ſhake their heads with ſolemn motion, and pretend to wonder, what can be the meaning of theſe letters. <hi>"Great-Britain, "</hi> they ſay, "is too powerful to contend with; ſhe is determined to oppreſs us; it is in vain to ſpeak of right on one ſide, when there is power on the other; when we are ſtrong enough to reſiſt, we ſhall attempt it; but now we are not ſtrong enough, and therefore we had better be quiet; it ſignifies nothing to convince us that our rights are invaded, when we cannot defend them; and if we ſhould get into riots and tumults about the late act, it will only draw down heavier diſpleaſure upon us."</p>
                        <p>WHAT can ſuch men deſign? What do their grave obſervations amount to, but this—"that theſe colonies, totally regardleſs of their liberties, ſhould commit them, with humble reſignation, to <hi>chance, time,</hi> and the tender mercies of <hi>Miniſters.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>ARE theſe men ignorant, that uſurpations, which might have been ſucceſsfully oppoſed at firſt, acquire ſtrength by continuance, and thus become irreſiſtable? Do they condemn the conduct of theſe colonies, concerning the <hi>Stamp-Act?</hi> Or have they forgot its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful iſſue? Ought the colonies at that time, inſtead of acting as they did, to have truſted for relief, to the fortuitous events of futurity? If it is needleſs "to ſpeak of rights" now, it was as needleſs then. If the behaviour of the colonies was prudent and glorious then, and ſucceſsful too; it will be equally prudent and glorious to act in the ſame manner now, if our rights are equally invaded, and may be as ſucceſsful. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it becomes neceſſary to enquire, whether our rights <hi>are</hi> invaded." To talk of "defending" them, as if they could be no otherwiſe "defended" than by arms, is as much out of the way, as if a man having a choice of ſeveral roads to reach his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's end, ſhould prefer the worſt, for no other reaſon, but becauſe it <hi>is</hi> the worſt.</p>
                        <p>As to "riots and tumults, " the Gentlemen who are ſo apprehenſive of them, are much miſtaken, if they think, that grievances cannot be redreſſed without ſuch aſſiſtance.</p>

                        <p>I HOPE, my dear countrymen, that you will, in every colony, be upon your guard againſt thoſe, who may at any time endeavour to ſtir you up, under pretences of patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to any meaſures diſreſpectful to our ſovereign and our Mother country. Hot, raſh, diſorderly proceedings, injure the reputation of a people, as to wiſdom, valour, and virtue, without procuring them the leaſt benefit. I pray GOD, that he may be pleaſed to inſpire you and your poſterity, to the lateſt ages, with a ſpirit of which I have an idea, that I find a difficulty to expreſs. To expreſs it in the beſt manner I can, I mean a ſpirit, that ſhall ſo guide you, that it will be impoſſible to determine whether an <hi>American'</hi>s character is moſt diſtinguiſhable, for his loyalty to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, his duty to his Mother country, his love of freedom, or his affection for his native ſoil.</p>
                        <p>EVERY government at ſome time or other falls into wrong meaſures. This may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from miſtake or paſſion. But every ſuch meaſure does not diſſolve the obligation between the governors and the governed. The miſtake may be corrected; the paſſion may ſubſide. It is the duty of the governed to endeavour to rectify the miſtake, and to appeaſe the paſſion. They have not at firſt any other right, than to repreſent their grievances, and to pray for redreſs, unleſs an emergence is ſo preſſing, as not to allow time for receiving an anſwer to their applications, which rarely happens. If their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications are diſregarded, then that kind of <hi>oppoſition</hi> becomes juſtifiable, which can be made without breaking the laws, or diſturbing the public peace. This conſiſts in the <hi>prevention of the oppreſſors reaping advantage from their oppreſſions,</hi> and not in their puniſhment. For experience may teach them, what reaſon did not; and harſh methods cannot be proper, till milder ones have failed.</p>
                        <p>IF at length it becomes <hi>undoubted,</hi> that an inveterate reſolution is formed to annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the liberties of the governed, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hiſtory affords frequent examples of reſiſtance by force. What particular circumſtances will in any future caſe juſtify ſuch reſiſtance, can never be aſcertained, till they happen. Perhaps it may be allowable to ſay generally, that it never can be juſtifiable, until the people are <hi>fully convinced,</hi> that any further ſubmiſſion will be deſtructive to their happineſs.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the appeal is made to the ſword, highly probable is it, that the puniſhment will exceed the offence; and the calamities attending on war out-weigh thoſe preceding it. Theſe conſiderations of juſtice and prudence, will always have great influence with good and wiſe men.</p>

To theſe reflections on this ſubject, it remains to be added, and ought for ever to be remembered, that reſiſtance, in the caſe of colonies againſt their Mother country, is extremely different from the reſiſtance of a people againſt their Prince. A nation may change their King, or race of Kings, and, retaining their antient form of government, be gainers by changing. Thus <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> under the illuſtrious houſe of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> a houſe that ſeems to flouriſh for the happineſs of mankind, has found a felicity, unknown in the reigns of the <hi>Stewarts.</hi> But if once <hi>we</hi> are ſeparated from our Mother country, what new form of government ſhall we adopt, or where ſhall we find another <hi>Britain,</hi> to ſupply our loſs? Torn from the body, to which we are united by religion, liberty, laws, affections, relation, language and commerce, we muſt bleed at every vein.</p>
                        <p>IN truth—the proſperity of theſe provinces is founded in their dependance on <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> and when ſhe returns to her "old good humour, and her old good nature, " as Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> expreſſes it, I hope they will always think it their duty and intereſt, as it moſt certainly will be, to promote her welfare by all the means in their power.</p>
                        <p>WE cannot act with too much caution in our diſputes. Anger produces anger; and differences, that might be accommodated by kind and reſpectful behaviour, may, by imprudence, be enlarged to an incurable rage. In quarrels between countries, as well as in thoſe between individuals, when they have riſen to a certain height, the firſt cauſe of diſſenſion is no longer remembered, the minds of the parties being wholly engaged in recollecting and reſenting the mutual expreſſions of their diſlike. When feuds have reached that fatal point, all conſiderations of reaſon and equity vaniſh; and a blind fury governs, or rather confounds all things. A people no longer regards their intereſt, but the gratification of their wrath. The ſway of the <hi>Cleons</hi>

                        <p>THE conſtitutional modes of obtaining relief, are thoſe which I wiſh to ſee purſued on the preſent occaſion; that is, by petitions of our Aſſemblies, or where they are not permitted to meet, of the people, to the powers that can afford us relief.</p>
                        <p>WE have an excellent Prince, in whoſe good diſpoſitions towards us we may conſide. We have a generous, ſenſible and humane nation, to whom we may apply. They may be deceived, they may by artful men, be provoked to anger againſt us. I cannot believe they will be cruel or unjuſt; or that their anger will be implacable. Let us behave like dutiful children, who have received unmerited blows from a beloved parent. Let us complain to our parent; but let our complaints ſpeak at the ſame time the language of affliction and veneration.</p>

                        <p>AN objection, I hear, has been made againſt my ſecond letter, which I would willingly clear up before I proceed. "There is, " ſay theſe objectors, "a material difference between the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> and the <hi>late act</hi> for laying a duty on paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that juſtifies the conduct of thoſe who oppoſed the former, and yet are willing to ſubmit to the latter. The duties impoſed by the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> were <hi>internal</hi> taxes; but the preſent are <hi>external,</hi> and therefore the Parliament may have a right to impoſe them."</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer, with a total denial of the power of Parliament to lay upon theſe colonies any <hi>"tax"</hi> whatever.</p>
                        <p>THIS point, being ſo important to this, and to ſucceeding generations, I wiſh to be clearly underſtood.</p>
                        <p>To the word <hi>"tax, "</hi> I annex that meaning which the conſtitution and hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> require to be annexed to it; that is—that it is <hi>an impoſition on the ſubject, for the ſole purpoſe of levying money.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IN the early ages of our monarchy, certain ſervices were rendered to the Crown <hi>for the general good.</hi> Theſe were perſonal<note n="*" place="bottom">It is very worthy of remark, how watchful our wiſe anceſtors were, leſt their <hi>ſervices</hi> ſhould be encreaſed beyond what the law allowed. No man was bound to go out of the realm to ſerve the King. Therefore, even in the conquering reign of <hi>Henry the Fifth,</hi> when the martial ſpirit of the nation was highly enflamed by the heroic courage of their Prince, and by his great ſucceſs, they ſtill carefully guarded againſt the eſtabliſhment of illegal ſervices. "When this point (ſays Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi>) concerning maintenance of wars out of <hi>England,</hi> came in queſtion, the <hi>Commons</hi> did make their <hi>continual claim</hi> of their <hi>antient freedom</hi> and <hi>birthright,</hi> as in the firſt of <hi>Henry the Fifth,</hi> and in the ſeventh of <hi>Henry the Fifth,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Commons</hi> made a PROTEST, that they were not bound to the maintenance of war in <hi>Scotland, Ireland, Calice, France, Normandy,</hi> or other <hi>foreign</hi> parts, and cauſed their PROTESTS to be entered into the Parliament rolls, where they yet remain; which, in effect, agreeth with that which, upon like occaſion, was made in the Parliament of 25th <hi>Edward</hi> 1." 2d Inſt. p. 528.</note> But, in proceſs of time, ſuch inſtitutions

being ſound inconvenient, <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>grants</hi> of their own property were made by the people, under the ſeveral names of aids, tallages, taſks, taxes and ſubſidies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe were made, as may be collected even from the names, <hi>for public ſervice</hi> upon "need and neceſſity<note n="†" place="bottom">4th Inſt. p. 28.</note>." All theſe ſums were levied upon the people by virtue of their voluntary gift<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                              <p>Theſe gifts entirely depending on the pleaſure of the donors, were proportioned to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of the ſeveral ranks of people who gave, and were regulated by <hi>their</hi> opinion of the public neceſſities. Thus <hi>Edward</hi> I, had in his 11th year a <hi>thirtieth</hi> from the <hi>Laity,</hi> a <hi>twentieth</hi> from the <hi>Clergy;</hi> in his 22d year a <hi>tenth</hi> from the <hi>Laity,</hi> a <hi>ſixth</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> and other corporate towns, <hi>half of their benefices</hi> from the <hi>Clergy;</hi> in his 23d year an <hi>eleventh</hi> from the <hi>Barons</hi> and others, a <hi>tenth</hi> from the <hi>Clergy,</hi> a <hi>ſeventh</hi> from the <hi>Burgeſſes, &amp;c.

                              <p>The ſame difference in the grants of the ſeveral ranks is obſervable in other reigns.</p>
                              <p>In the famous ſtatute <hi>de tallagio non concedendo,</hi> the King enumerates the ſeveral <hi>claſſes,</hi> without whoſe conſent, he and his heirs never ſhould ſet or levy any tax—<hi>"nullum tallaguium, vel auxilium per nos, vel haeredes noſtros in regno noſtro ponatur ſeu levetur, ſine voluntate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke,</hi> in his comment on theſe words, ſays—"for the quieting of the <hi>Commons,</hi> and for a <hi>perpetual and conſtant law for ever after,</hi> both in this <hi>and other like caſes,</hi> this act was made." Theſe words are <hi>plain, without any ſcruple, abſolute, without any ſaving."</hi> 2d <hi>Coke'</hi>s Inſt. p. 532, 533. Little did the venerable judge imagine, that <hi>"other like caſes"</hi> would happen, in which the ſpirit of this law would be deſpiſed by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,</hi> the poſterity of thoſe who made it.</p>
                           </note>. Their deſign was to ſupport the <hi>national honour and intereſt.</hi> Some of thoſe grants comprehended duties ariſing from trade; being impoſts on merchandizes.

                        </p>
                        <p>COMMERCE was at a low ebb, and ſurprizing inſtances might be produced how little it was attended to for a ſucceſſion of ages.

WHENEVER we ſpeak of "taxes" among <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> let us therefore ſpeak of them with reference to the <hi>principles</hi> on which, and the <hi>intentions</hi> with which they have been eſtabliſhed. This will give certainty to our expreſſion, and ſafety to our conduct: But if, when we have in view the liberty of theſe colonies, we proceed in any other courſe, we purſue a <hi>Juno</hi>

                        <p>The third, fourth, fifth, and ſixth reſolves are thus expreſſed.</p>

                        <p>IV. "THAT the people of the colonies are not, and from their local circumſtances, cannot be repreſented in the Houſe of Commons in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>"</p>

                        <p>VI. "THAT <hi>all ſupplies to the Crown,</hi> being free gifts of the people, it is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and inconſiſtent with the principles and ſpirit of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>conſtitution,</hi> for the people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to grant to his Majeſty <hi>the property of the colonies.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>HERE is no diſtinction made between <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external</hi> taxes. It is evident from the ſhort reaſoning thrown into theſe reſolves, that every impoſition "to grant to his Majeſty <hi>the property of the colonies,"</hi> was thought a "tax;" and that every ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, if laid any other way, than "with their conſent, given perſonally, or by their repreſentatives, " was not only "unreaſonable, and inconſiſtent with the principles and ſpirit of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution, " but deſtructive "to the freedom of a people."</p>
                        <p>THIS language is clear and important. A <hi>"tax"</hi> means an impoſition to raiſe money. Such perſons therefore as ſpeak of <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external "taxes, "</hi> I pray may pardon me, if I object to that expreſſion, as applied to the privileges and intereſts of theſe colonies.

But <hi>all taxes</hi> are founded on the <hi>ſame principle;</hi> and have the <hi>ſame tendency.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>EXTERNAL impoſitions, for the regulation of our trade, do not "grant to his Majeſty <hi>the property of the colonies."</hi> They only <hi>prevent the colonies acquiring property,</hi> in things not neceſſary, in a manner judged to be injurious to the welfare of the whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.

But the laſt ſtatute reſpecting us, "grants to his Majeſty <hi>the property of the colonies,"</hi> by laying duties on the manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> which they <hi>muſt</hi> take, and which ſhe ſettled them, on purpoſe that they <hi>ſhould</hi> take.</p>

                              <p>It ſeems to be evident, that Mr. <hi>Pitt,</hi> in his defence of <hi>America,</hi> during the debate concerning the repeal of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> by <hi>"internal</hi> taxes, " meant any duties "for the purpoſe of raiſing a revenue;" and by <hi>"external</hi> taxes, " meant duties impoſed "for the regulation of trade." His expreſſions are theſe—"If the Gentleman does not underſtand the difference between <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external</hi> taxes, I cannot help it; but there is a plain diſtinction between taxes levied <hi>for the purpoſes of raiſing a revenue,</hi> and duties impoſed <hi>for the regulation of trade,</hi> for the accommodation of the ſubject, altho', in the conſequences, ſome revenue might incidentally ariſe from the latter."</p>
                              <p>Theſe words were in Mr. <hi>Pitt'</hi>s reply to Mr. <hi>Grenville,</hi> who ſaid he could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the difference between external and internal taxes.</p>
                              <p>In every other part of his ſpeeches on that occaſion, his words confirm this conſtruction of his expreſſions. The following extracts will ſhew how poſitive and general were his aſſertions of our right.</p>
                              <p>"It is my opinion that this kingdom has <hi>no right</hi> to lay <hi>a tax</hi> upon the colonies."—"The <hi>Americans</hi> are the <hi>ſons,</hi> not the <hi>baſtards</hi> of <hi>England.

                        <p>PERHAPS the objection to the late act, impoſing duties upon paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might have been ſafely reſted on the argument drawn from the univerſal conduct of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments and Miniſters, from the firſt exiſtence of theſe colonies, to the adminiſtration of Mr. <hi>Grenville.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHAT but the indiſputable, the acknowledged excluſive right of the colonies to tax themſelves, could be the reaſon, that in this long period of more than one hundred and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011239_0013_0F86794DB43F4268"/>
fifty years, no ſtatute was ever paſſed for the ſole purpoſe of raiſing a revenue on the colonies? And how clear, how cogent muſt that reaſon be, to which every Parliament, and every Miniſter, for ſo long a time ſubmitted, without a ſingle attempt to innovate?</p>
                        <p>ENGLAND, in part of that courſe of years, and <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in other parts, was engaged in ſeveral fierce and expenſive wars; troubled with ſome tumultuous and bold Parliaments; governed by many daring and wicked Miniſters; yet none of them ever ventured to touch the <hi>Palladium</hi> of <hi>American</hi> liberty. Ambition, avarice, faction, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, all revered it. Whenever it was neceſſary to raiſe money on the colonies, the requiſitions of the Crown were made, and dutifully complied with. The Parliament, from time to time, regulated their trade, and that of the reſt of the empire, to preſerve their dependence, and the connection of the whole in good order.</p>
                        <p>THE people of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in ſupport of their privileges, boaſt much of their antiquity. It is true they are antient; yet it may well be queſtioned, if there is a ſingle privilege of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubject, ſupported by longer, more ſolemn, or more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted teſtimony, than the excluſive right of taxation in theſe colonies. The people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> conſider that kingdom as the ſovereign of theſe colonies, and would now annex to that ſovereignty a prerogative never heard of before. How would they bear this, was the caſe their own? What would they think of a <hi>new</hi> prerogative claimed by the Crown? We may gueſs what their conduct would be, from the tranſports of paſſion into which they fell about the late embargo, though laid to relieve the moſt emergent neceſſities of ſtate, admitting of no delay; and for which there were numerous precedents. Let our liberties be treated with the ſame tenderneſs, and it is all we deſire.</p>
                        <p>EXPLICIT as the conduct of Parliaments, for ſo many ages, is, to prove that no money can be levied on theſe colonies by Parliaments, for the purpoſe of raiſing a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, yet it is not the only evidence in our favour.</p>
                        <p>EVERY one of the moſt material arguments againſt the legality of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> operates with equal force againſt the act now objected to; but as they are well known, it ſeems unneceſſary to repeat them here.</p>
                        <p>THIS general one only ſhall be conſidered at preſent: That though theſe colonies are dependent on <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> and though ſhe has a legal power to make laws for preſerving that dependence; yet it is not neceſſary for this purpoſe, nor eſſential to the relation between a Mother country and her colonies, as was eagerly contended by the advocates for the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> that ſhe ſhould raiſe money on them without their conſent.</p>
                        <p>COLONIES were formerly planted by warlike nations, to keep their enemies in awe; to relieve their country, overburthened with inhabitants; or to diſcharge a number of diſcontented and troubleſome citizens. But in more modern ages, the ſpirit of violence being, in ſome meaſure, if the expreſſion may be allowed, ſheathed in commerce, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have been ſettled by the nations of <hi>Europe</hi> for the purpoſes of trade. Theſe purpoſes were to be attained, by the colonies raiſing for their Mother country thoſe things which ſhe did not produce herſelf; and by ſupplying themſelves from her with things they wanted. Theſe were the <hi>national objects</hi> in the commencement of our colonies, and have been uniformly ſo in their promotion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="20" facs="unknown:011239_0014_0F86794E714BFEC0"/>
To anſwer theſe grand purpoſes, perfect liberty was known to be neceſſary; all hiſtory proving, that trade and freedom are nearly related to each other. By a due regard to this wiſe and juſt plan, the infant colonies, expoſed in the unknown climates and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored wilderneſſes of this new world, lived, grew, and flouriſhed.</p>
                        <p>THE Parent country, with undeviating prudence and virtue, attentive to the firſt principles of colonization, drew to herſelf the benefits ſhe might reaſonably expect, and preſerved to her children the bleſſings, on which thoſe benefits were founded. She made laws, obliging her colonies to carry to her all thoſe products which ſhe wanted for her own uſe; and all thoſe raw materials which ſhe choſe herſelf to work up. Beſides this reſtriction, ſhe forbad them to procure <hi>manufactures</hi> from any other part of the globe, or even the <hi>products</hi> of <hi>European</hi> countries, which alone could rival her, without being firſt brought to her. In ſhort, by a variety of laws, ſhe regulated their trade in ſuch a manner as ſhe thought moſt conducive to their mutual advantage, and her own welfare. A power was reſerved to the Crown of <hi>repealing</hi> any laws that ſhould be enacted: The <hi>executive</hi> authority of government was alſo lodged in the Crown, and its repreſentatives; and an <hi>appeal</hi> was ſecured to the Crown from all judgments in the adminiſtration of juſtice.</p>
                        <p>FOR all theſe powers, eſtabliſhed by the Mother country over the colonies; for all theſe immenſe emoluments derived by her from them; for all their difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes in fixing themſelves, what was the recompence made them? A communication of her rights in general, and particularly of that great one, the foundation of all the reſt—that their property, acquired with ſo much pain and hazard, ſhould be diſpoſed of by none but themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">The power of <hi>taxing themſelves,</hi> was the privilege of which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were, <hi>"with reaſon, " particularly jealous.</hi> HUME<hi>'s Hiſt. of England.</hi>
                           </note>—or, to uſe the beautiful and emphatic language of the ſacred ſcriptures, "that they ſhould ſit <hi>every man</hi> under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and <hi>none ſhould make them afraid.</hi>
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">Mic. iv. 4.</note>"</p>
                        <p>CAN any man of candour and knowledge deny, that theſe inſtitutions form an affinity between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her colonies, that ſufficiently ſecures their dependence upon her? Or that for her to levy taxes upon them, is to reverſe the nature of things? Or that ſhe can purſue ſuch a meaſure, without reducing them to a ſtate of vaſſalage?</p>
                        <p>IF any perſon cannot conceive the ſupremacy of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to exiſt, without the power of laying taxes to levy money upon us, the hiſtory of the colonies, and of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> ſince their ſettlement, will prove the contrary. He will there find the amazing advantages ariſing to her from them—the conſtant exerciſe of her ſupremacy—and their filial ſubmiſſion to it, without a ſingle rebellion, or even the thought of one, from their firſt emigration to this moment—And all theſe things have happened, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one inſtance of <hi>Great-Britain'</hi>s laying taxes to levy money upon them.</p>

                        <p>IT may perhaps be objected againſt the arguments that have been offered to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, concerning the legal power of the Parliament, "that it has always exerciſed the power of impoſing duties, for the purpoſes of raiſing a revenue on the productions of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011239_0016_0F867950C96555A0"/>
theſe colonies carried to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> which may be called a tax on them." To this objection I anſwer, that this is no violation of the rights of the colonies, it being implied in the relation between and <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that they ſhould not carry ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to other nations, as ſhould enable them to interfere with the Mother country. The impoſition of duties on theſe commodities, when brought to her, is only a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of her parental right; and if the point is thoroughly examined, the duties will be found to be laid on the people of the Mother country. Whatever they are, they muſt proportionably raiſe the price of the goods, and conſequently muſt be paid by the conſumers. In this light they were conſidered by the Parliament in the 25th <hi>Charles</hi> II. Chap. 7, Sect. 2, which ſays, that the productions of the plantations were carried from one to another free from all cuſtoms, "while the ſubjects of this your kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have paid <hi>great cuſtoms and impoſitions for what of them have been ſpent here, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BESIDES, if <hi>Great-Britain</hi> exports theſe commodities again, the duties will injure her own trade, ſo that ſhe cannot hurt us, without plainly and immediately hurting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and this is our check againſt her acting arbitrarily in this reſpect.</p>

                              <p>If any one ſhould obſerve that no oppoſition has been made to the legality of the 4th <hi>George</hi> III. Chap. 15, which is the <hi>firſt</hi> act of Parliament that ever impoſed duties on the importations into <hi>America,</hi> for the <hi>expreſſed</hi> purpoſe of raiſing a revenue there; I anſwer—Firſt, That though the act expreſsly mentions the raiſing a revenue in <hi>America,</hi> yet it ſeems that it had as much in view the "improving and ſecuring the trade between the ſame and <hi>Great-Britain,"</hi> which words are part of its title: And the preamble ſays, "Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is expedient that new proviſions and regulations ſhould be eſtabliſhed for improving the revenue of this kingdom, and <hi>for extending and ſecuring the navigation and commerce between</hi> Great-Britain <hi>and your Majeſty's dominions in</hi> America, which by the peace have been ſo happily extended and enlarged, <hi>"&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, <hi>All</hi> the duties mentioned in that act are impoſed ſolely on the <hi>productions and manufactures of foreign countries,</hi> and not a ſingle duty laid on any production or manufacture of our Mother country. Thirdly, The authority of the provincial Aſſemblies is not therein ſo plainly <hi>attacked</hi> as by the laſt act, which makes proviſion for defraying the charges of the "adminiſtration of juſtice," and the "ſupport of civil government." Fourthly, That it being <hi>doubtful,</hi> whether the intention of the 4th <hi>Geroge</hi> III. Chap. 15. was not as much to <hi>regulate trade,</hi> as <hi>to raiſe a revenue,</hi> the minds of the people here were wholly engroſſed by the terror of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> then impending over them, about the intention of which there could be <hi>no doubt.</hi>

                              <p>Theſe reaſons ſo far diſtinguiſh the 4th <hi>George</hi> III. Chap. 15, from the laſt act, that it is not to be wondered at, that the firſt ſhould have been ſubmitted to, though the <hi>laſt</hi> ſhould excite the moſt univerſal and ſpirited oppoſition. For <hi>this</hi> will be found, on the ſtricteſt examination, to be, in the <hi>principle</hi> on which it is founded, and in the <hi>conſequences</hi> that muſt attend it, if poſſible, more deſtructive than the <hi>Stamp-Act.</hi> It is, to ſpeak plainly, a <hi>prodigy</hi> in our laws; not having one <hi>Britiſh</hi> feature.</p>
                           </note> IT may be perhaps further objected, "that it being granted that ſtatutes made for regulating trade, are binding upon us, it will be difficult for any perſons, but the makers of the laws, to determine, which of them are made for the regulating of trade, and which for raiſing a revenue; and that from hence may ariſe confuſion."</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer, that the objection is of no force in the preſent caſe, or ſuch as

                        <p>HOWEVER, ſuppoſing the deſign of Parliament had not been <hi>expreſſed,</hi> the objection ſeems to me of no weight, with regard to the influence which thoſe who may make it might expect it ought to have on the conduct of theſe colonies.</p>
                        <p>IT is true, that <hi>impoſitions for raiſing a revenue,</hi> may be hereafter called <hi>regulations of trade:</hi> But names will not change the nature of things. Indeed we ought firmly to believe, what is an undoubted truth, confirmed by the unhappy experience of many ſtates heretofore free, that <hi>unleſs the moſt watchful attention be exerted, a new ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may be ſlipped upon us, under the ſanction of uſual and reſpectable terms.</hi>

                        <p>I WILL beg leave to enforce this remark by a few inſtances. The Crown, by the conſtitution, has the prerogative of creating Peers. The exiſtence of that order, in due number and dignity, is eſſential to the conſtitution; and if the Crown did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that prerogative, the peerage muſt have long ſince decreaſed ſo much as to have loſt its proper influence. Suppoſe a Prince, for ſome unjuſt purpoſes, ſhould from time to time, advance ſo many needy, profligate wretches to that rank, that all the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the Houſe of Lords ſhould be deſtroyed: there would then be a manifeſt violation of the conſtitution, <hi>under the appearance of uſing legal prerogative.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE Houſe of Commons claims the privilege of forming all money bills, and will not ſuffer either of the other branches of the legiſlature to add to, or alter them; contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their power ſimply extends to an acceptance or rejection of them. This pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege appears to be juſt: But under pretence of this juſt privilege, the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons has claimed a licence of tacking to money bills, clauſes relating to things of a totally different kind, and thus forcing them in a manner on the King and Lords. This ſeems to be an abuſe of that privilege, and it may be vaſtly more abuſed. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011239_0017_0F867951764791A0"/>
a future Houſe, influenced by ſome diſplaced, diſcontented demagogues, in a time of danger, ſhould tack to a money bill, ſomething ſo injurious to the King and Peers, that they would not aſſent to it, and yet the Commons ſhould obſtinately inſiſt on it; the whole kingdom would be expoſed to ruin by them, <hi>under the appearance of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a valuable privilege.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IN theſe caſes it might be difficult for a while to determine, whether the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to exerciſe his prerogative in a conſtitutional manner or not; or whether the Commons inſiſted on their demand ſactiouſly, or for the public good: But ſurely the conduct of the Crown, or of the Houſe, would in time ſufficiently explain itſelf.</p>

And have they not a right of <hi>judging</hi> from the evidence before them, on no ſlighter points than their <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>happineſs?</hi> It would be leſs than trifling, wherever a <hi>Britiſh</hi> government is eſtabliſhed, to make uſe of any arguments to prove ſuch a right. It is ſufficient to remind the reader of the day, on the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of which the firſt of theſe letters is dated.</p>
                        <p>I WILL now apply what has been ſaid to the preſent queſtion.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>nature</hi> of any impoſitions laid by Parliament on theſe colonies, muſt determine the <hi>deſign</hi> in laying them. It may not be eaſy in every inſtance to diſcover that deſign. Wherever it is doubtful, I think ſubmiſſion cannot be dangerous; nay, it muſt be right; for, in my opinion, there is no privilege theſe colonies claim, which they ought in <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> more earneſtly to maintain and defend, than the authority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament to regulate the trade of all her dominions. Without this authority, the benefits ſhe enjoys from our commerce, muſt be loſt to her: The bleſſings we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy from our dependence upon her, muſt be loſt to us. Her ſtrength muſt decay; her glory vaniſh; and ſhe cannot ſuffer without our partaking in her miſfortune. <hi>Let us therefore cheriſh her intereſts as our own, and give her every thing that it becomes free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to give or to receive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE <hi>nature</hi> of any impoſitions ſhe may lay upon us may, in general, be known, by conſidering how far they relate to the preſerving, in due order, the connection between the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire. One thing we may be aſſured of, which is this—Whenever ſhe impoſes duties on commodities, to be paid only upon their expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to theſe colonies, it is not a regulation of trade, but a deſign to raiſe a revenue upon us. Other inſtances may happen, which it may not be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at preſent to dwell on. I hope theſe colonies will never, to their lateſt exiſtence, want underſtanding ſufficient to diſcover the intentions of thoſe who rule over them, nor the reſolution neceſſary for aſſerting their intereſts. They will always have the ſame rights, that all free ſtates have, of judging when their privileges are invaded, and of uſing all prudent meaſures for preſerving them.</p>

                        </opener>
                        <p>THIS letter is intended more particularly for ſuch of you, whoſe employments in life may have prevented your attending to the conſideration of ſome points that are of great and public importance: For many ſuch perſons there muſt be even in theſe colonies, where the inhabitants in general are more intelligent than any other people whatever, as has been remarked by ſtrangers, and it ſeems with reaſon.</p>
                        <p>SOME of you, perhaps, filled, as I know your breaſts are, with loyalty to our moſt excellent Prince, and with love to our dear Mother country, may feel yourſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, by the affections of your hearts, to approve every action of thoſe whom you ſo much venerate and eſteem. A prejudice thus flowing from goodneſs of diſpoſition, is amiable indeed. I wiſh it could be indulged without danger. Did I think this poſſible, the error ſhould have been adopted, and not oppoſed by me. But in truth, all men are ſubject to the frailties of nature; and therefore whatever regard we entertain for the <hi>perſons</hi> of thoſe who govern us, we ſhould always remember that their conduct, as <hi>rulers,</hi> may be influenced by human infirmities.</p>
                        <p>WHEN any laws, injurious to theſe colonies, are paſſed, we cannot ſuppoſe, that any injury was intended us by his Majeſty, or the Lords. For the aſſent of the Crown and Peers to laws, ſeems, as far as I am able to judge, to have been veſted in them, more for their own ſecurity, than for any other purpoſe. On the other hand, it is the particular buſineſs of the people, to enquire and diſcover what regulations are uſeful for themſelves, and to digeſt and preſent them in the form of bills, to the other orders, to have them enacted into laws. Where theſe laws are to bind <hi>themſelves,</hi> it may be expected, that the Houſe of Commons will very carefully conſider them: But when they are making laws that are not deſigned to bind <hi>themſelves,</hi> we cannot imagine that their deliberations will be as<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>Many remarkable inſtances might be produced of the extraordinary inattention with which bills of great importance, concerning theſe colonies, hafe paſſed in Parliament; which is owing, as it is ſuppoſed, to the bills being brought in by the perſons who have haſte of buſineſs, to diſcover their tendency.</p>
                              <p>The following inſtances ſhew the truth of this remark. When Mr. <hi>Grenville,</hi> in the violence of reformation, formed the 4th of <hi>George</hi> III. Chap. 15th, for regulating the <hi>American</hi> trade, the word <hi>"Ireland"</hi> was dropt in the clauſe relating to our iron and lumber, ſo that we could ſend theſe articles to no part of <hi>Europe,</hi> but to <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> This was ſo unreaſonable a reſtriction, and ſo contrary to the ſentiments of the legiſlature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For many years before, that it is ſurpriſing it ſhould not have been taken notice of in the Houſe. However the bill paſſed into a law. But when the matter was explained, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction was taken off by a ſubſequent act. I cannot poſitively ſay how long after the taking off this reſtriction, as I have not the act, but I think, in leſs than 18 months, another act of Parliament paſſed, in which the word <hi>"Ireland"</hi> was left out, juſt as it had been before. The matter being a ſecond time explained, was a ſecond time regulated.</p>
                              <p>Now if it be conſidered, that the omiſſion mentioned ſtruck off with <hi>one</hi> word <hi>ſo very great a part of our trade,</hi> it muſt appear <hi>remarkable;</hi> and equally ſo is the method, by which <hi>rice</hi> becauſe an enumerated commodity.</p>
                              <p>"The enumeration was obtained (ſays Mr. <hi>[a] Gee</hi>) by one <hi>Cole,</hi> a Captain of a ſhip, employed by a company then trading to <hi>Carolina;</hi> for ſeveral ſhips going from <hi>England</hi> thither, and purchaſing rice for <hi>Portugal,</hi> prevented <hi>the aforeſaid Captain</hi> of a loading. Upon his coming home, he poſſeſſed one Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi> a member of Parliament <hi>(who was very frequently employed to prepare bills)</hi> with an opinion, that carrying rice direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Portugal,</hi> was a prejudice to the trade of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>privately</hi> got a clauſe into an act, to make it an enumerated commodity; <hi>by which means he ſecured a freight to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But the conſequence proved a vaſt loſs to the nation."</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>I find that this clauſe, <hi>"privately</hi> got into an act, <hi>"for the benefit of Captain Cole,</hi> to the <hi>"vaſt loſs of the nation, "</hi> is foiſted into the 3d and 4th <hi>Anne,</hi> Chap. 5th, intituled, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>An act for granting to her Majeſty a further ſubſidy on wines and merchandizes import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<g ref="char:endq">”</g> with which it has no more connection, than with 34th <hi>Edward</hi> I. the 34th and 35th of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and the 25th of <hi>Charles</hi> II. <hi>which provide, that no perſon ſhall be taxed but by himſelf or his repreſentative.</hi>

I AM told, that there is a wonderful addreſs frequently uſed in carrying points in the Houſe of Commons, by perſons experienced in theſe affairs.—That opportunities are watched—and ſometimes votes are paſſed, that if all the members had been preſent, would have been rejected by a great majority. Certain it is, that when a powerful and artful man has determined on any meaſure againſt theſe colonies, he has always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his attempt. Perhaps therefore it will be proper for us, whenever any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive act affecting us is paſſed, to attribute it to the inattention of the members of the Houſe of Commons, and to the malevolence or ambition of ſome factious great man, rather than to any other cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Now I do verily believe, that the late act of Parliament, impoſing duties on paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was formed by Mr. <hi>Grenville,</hi> and his party, becauſe it is evidently a part of that plan, by which he endeavoured to render himſelf <hi>popular</hi> at home; and I do alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that not one half of the members of the Houſe of Commons, even of thoſe who heard it read, did perceive how deſtructive it was to <hi>American</hi> freedom. For this reaſon, as it is uſual in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to conſider the King's ſpeech as the ſpeech of the Miniſtry, it may be right here to conſider this act as the act of a <hi>party,</hi> perhaps I ſhould ſpeak more properly, if I was to uſe another term.</p>
                        <p>THERE are two ways of laying taxes. One is, by impoſing a certain ſum on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kinds of property, to be paid by the <hi>uſer</hi> or <hi>conſumer,</hi> or by rating the <hi>perſon</hi> at
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011239_0019_0F867952FA2CD668"/>
a certain ſum. The other is, by impoſing a certain ſum on particular kinds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, to be paid by the <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ller.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHEN a man pays the firſt ſort of tax, he <hi>knows with certainty</hi> that he pays ſo much money <hi>for a tax.</hi> The <hi>conſideration</hi> for which he pays it, is remote, and it may be, does not occur to him. He is ſenſible too, that he is <hi>commanded and obliged</hi> to pay it <hi>as a tax;</hi> and therefore people are apt to be diſpleaſed with this ſort of tax.</p>
                        <p>THE other ſort of tax is ſubmitted to in a very different manner. The purchaſer of any article, very ſeldom reflects that the ſeller raiſes his price, ſo as to indemnify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the tax <hi>he</hi> has paid. He knows that the prices of things are continually fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating, and if he thinks about the tax, he thinks at the ſame time, that he <hi>might</hi> have paid as much, if the article he buys had not been taxed. He gets ſomething <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> for his money; and tax and price are ſo confounded together, that he cannot ſeparate, or does not chuſe to take the trouble of ſeparating them.</p>
                        <p>THIS mode of taxation therefore is the mode ſuited to arbitrary and oppreſſive govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The love of liberty is ſo natural to the human heart, that unfeeling tyrants think themſelves obliged to accommodate their ſchemes as much as they can to the appearance of juſtice and reaſon, and to deceive thoſe whom they reſolve to deſtroy, or oppreſs, by preſenting to them a miſerable picture of freedom, when the ineſtimable original is loſt.</p>
                        <p>THIS policy did not eſcape the cruel and rapacious <hi>Nero.</hi> That monſter, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that his crimes might endanger his authority and life, thought proper to do ſome popular acts, to ſecure the obedience of his ſubjects. Among other things, ſays <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,"</hi> he remitted the twenty-fifth part of the price on the ſale of ſlaves, but rather in <hi>ſhew</hi> than <hi>reality;</hi> for the <hi>ſeller</hi> being ordered to pay it, it became part of the price to the <hi>buyer</hi>

                        <p>THIS is the reflection of the judicious <hi>hiſtorian;</hi> but the deluded <hi>people</hi> gave their infamous Emperor full credit for his falſe generoſity. Other nations have been treated in the ſame manner the <hi>Romans</hi> were. The honeſt, induſtrious <hi>Germans,</hi> who are ſettled in different parts of this continent, can inform us, that it was this ſort of tax that drove them from their native land to our woods, at that time the ſeats of perfect and undiſturbed freedom.</p>
                        <p>THEIR Princes, enflamed by the luſt of power, and the luſt of avarice, two furies that the more they are gorged, the more hungry they grow, tranſgreſſed the bounds they ought, in regard to themſelves, to have obſerved. To keep up the deception in the minds of ſubjects, "there muſt be," ſays a very learned author<note n="†" place="bottom">

His ſubjects plainly ſee they are dealt with in an unreaſonable manner, which renders them moſt exquiſitely ſenſible of their ſlaviſh

                           </gap> this way as in the other; and that it will be taken, may be more evident, by attending to a few more conſiderations.</p>
                        <p>THE merchant or importer, who pays the duty at firſt, will not conſent to be ſo much money out of pocket. He therefore proportionably raiſes the price of his goods. It may then be ſaid to be a conteſt between him and the perſon offering to buy, who ſhall loſe the duty. This muſt be decided by the nature of the commodities, and the purchaſer's demand for them. If they are mere luxuries, he is at liberty to do as he pleaſes, and if he buys, he does it voluntarily: But if they are abſolute <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> or <hi>conveniences,</hi> which uſe and cuſtom have made requiſite for the comfort of life, and which he is not permitted, by the power impoſing the duty, <hi>to get elſewhere,</hi> there the ſeller has a plain advantage, and the buyer <hi>muſt</hi> pay the duty. In fact, the ſeller is nothing leſs than a collector of the tax for the power that impoſed it. If theſe duties then are extended to the neceſſaries and conveniences of life in general, and enormouſly increaſed, the people muſt at length become indeed "moſt exquiſitely ſenſible of their ſlaviſh ſituation." Their happineſs therefore entirely depends on the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who have authority to impoſe the duties.</p>
                        <p>I SHALL now apply theſe obſervations to the late act of Parliament. Certain duties are thereby impoſed on paper and glaſs imported into theſe colonies. By the laws of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> we are prohibited to get theſe articles from any other part of the world. We cannot at preſent, nor for many years to come, though we ſhould apply ourſelves to theſe manufactures with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Some perhaps, who think mankind grew wicked and luxurious, as ſoon as they found out another way of communicating their ſentiments than by ſpeech, and another way of dwelling than in caves, may advance ſo whimſical an opinion. But I preſume no body will take the unneceſſary trouble of refuting them.</p>
                        <p>FROM theſe remarks I think it evident, that we <hi>muſt</hi> uſe paper and glaſs; that what we uſe, <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>Britiſh;</hi> and that we <hi>muſt</hi> pay the duties impoſed, unleſs thoſe who ſell theſe articles, are ſo generous as to make us preſents of the duties they pay.</p>
                        <p>SOME perſons may think this act of no conſequence, becauſe the duties are ſo <hi>ſmall.</hi> A fatal error. <hi>That</hi> is the very circumſtance moſt alarming to me. For I am convinced, that the authors of this law would never have obtained an act to raiſe ſo trifling a ſum as it muſt do, had they not intended by <hi>it</hi> to eſtabliſh a <hi>precedent</hi> for future uſe. To that is ſet for us, praiſing the <hi>neatneſs</hi> of the workmanſhip. Suppoſe the duties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the late act could be paid by theſe diſtreſſed colonies with the utmoſt eaſe, and that the purpoſes to which they are to be applied, were the moſt reaſonable and equitable that can be convinced, the contrary of which I hope to demonſtrate before theſe letters are concluded; yet even in ſuch a ſuppoſed caſe, theſe colonies ought to regard the act with abhorrence. <hi>For who are a free people?</hi> Not <hi>thoſe,</hi> over whom
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011239_0020_0F867953B2B6E518"/>
government is reaſonably and equitably exerciſed, but <hi>thoſe,</hi> who live under a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo <hi>conſtitutionally checked and controuled,</hi> that proper proviſion is made againſt its being otherwiſe exerciſed.</p>
                        <p>THE late act is founded on the deſtruction of this conſtitutional ſecurity. If the Parliament have a right to lay a duty of Four Shillings and Eight-Pence on a hundred weight of glaſs, or a ream of paper, they have a right to lay a duty of any other ſum on either. They may raiſe the duty, as the author before quoted ſays has been done in ſome countries, till it "exceeds ſeventeen or eighteen times the value of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity." In ſhort, if they have a right <hi>to</hi> levy a tax of <hi>one penny</hi> upon us, they have a right to levy a <hi>million</hi> upon us: For where does their right ſtop? At any given num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Pence, Shillings or Pounds? To attempt to limit their right, after granting it to exiſt at all, is as contrary to reaſon—as granting it to exiſt at all, is contrary to juſtice. If <hi>they</hi> have any right to tax <hi>us</hi>—then, whether <hi>our own money</hi> ſhall continue in <hi>our own pockets</hi> or not, depends no longer on <hi>us,</hi> but on <hi>them.</hi> "There is nothing which" we "can call our own; or, to uſe the words of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>—<hi>what property have we in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleaſes, to himſelf?"</hi>

                              <p>"As the affair is of the <hi>utmoſt importance,</hi> and in its conſequences may involve the <hi>fate of kingdoms,</hi> I took the ſtricteſt review of my arguments; I re-examined all my authorities; fully determined, if I found myſelf miſtaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> publicly to own my miſtake, and give up my opinion: But my ſoarches have more and more convinced me, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have <hi>"no right to tax"</hi> the <hi>Americans."</hi>"—"Nor is the doctrine new; it is as old as the conſtitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its ſupport."—<hi>"Taxation</hi> and <hi>repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> are inſeparably united.

                              <p>"My poſition is this—I repeat it—I will maintain it to my laſt hour—<hi>taxation</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation</hi> are inſeparable—this poſition is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itſelf <hi>an eternal law of nature;</hi> for whatever is a man's own, is abſolutely his own; <hi>no man hath a right to take it from him without his conſent,</hi> either expreſſed by himſelf or repreſentative; <hi>whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down the diſtinction between liberty and ſlavery.</hi>"—"There is not a <hi>blade of graſs,</hi> in the moſt obſcure corner of the kingdom, which is not, which was not ever <hi>repreſented,</hi> ſince the conſtitution began: There is not a <hi>blade of graſs,</hi> which, when taxed, <hi>was not taxed by the conſent of the proprietor.</hi>" "The forefathers of the <hi>Americans</hi> did not leave their native country, and ſubject themſelves to every danger and diſtreſs, <hi>to be reduced to a ſtate of ſlavery.</hi> They did not give up their rights: They looked for protection, and <hi>not for chains,</hi> from their Mother country. By her they expected to be defended in the poſſeſſion of their property, and not to be deprived of it: For ſhould the preſent power continue, <hi>there is nothing which they can call their own;</hi> or, to uſe the words of Mr. <hi>Locke, "what property have they in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleaſes, to himſelf?"</hi>

                              <p>It is impoſſible to read this ſpeech, and Mr. <hi>Pitt'</hi>s, and not be charmed with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous zeal for the rights of mankind that glows in every ſentence. Theſe great and good men, animated by the ſubject they ſpeak upon, ſeem to riſe above all the former glorious exertions of their abilities.

                        <p>IN my opinion, a dangerous example is ſet in the laſt act relating to theſe colonies. The power of Parliament to levy money upon us for raiſing a revenue, is therein <hi>avowed</hi> and <hi>exerted.</hi> Regarding the act upon this ſingle principle. I muſt again repeat, and I think it my duty to repeat, that to me it appears to be <hi>unconſtitutional.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>No man, who conſiders the conduct of the Parliament ſince the repeal of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> and the diſpoſition of many people at home, can doubt, that the chief object of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there, is to uſe Mr. <hi>Grenville'</hi>s expreſſion, "providing that the <hi>dependence</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> of the colonies be aſſerted and maintained."</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="unknown:011239_0021_0F867954BAA250A0"/>
UNDER the influence of this notion, inſtantly on repealing the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> an act paſſed declaring the power of Parliament to bind theſe colonies <hi>in all caſes whatever.</hi> This however was only planting a barren tree, that caſt a <hi>ſhade</hi> indeed over the colonies, but yielded no <hi>fruit.</hi> It being determined to enforce the authority on which the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> was founded, the Parliament having never renounced the right, as Mr. <hi>Pitt</hi> adviſed them to do; and it being thought proper to diſguiſe that authority in ſuch a manner, as not again to alarm the colonies; ſome little time was required to find a method, by which both theſe points ſhould be united. At laſt the ingenuity of Mr. <hi>Grenville</hi> and his party accompliſhed the matter, as it was thought, in "an act for granting certain duties in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies and plantations in <hi>America,</hi> for allowing drawbacks, <hi>"&amp;c.</hi> which is the title of the act laying duties on paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE Parliament having ſeveral times before impoſed duties to be paid in <hi>America, it was expected, no doubt, that the repetition of ſuch a meaſure would be paſſed over, as an uſual thing.</hi> But to have done this, without expreſsly "aſſerting and maintaining" the power of Parliament to take our money without our conſent, and to apply it as they pleaſe, would not have been, in Mr. <hi>Grenville'</hi>s opinion, ſufficiently declarative of its ſupremacy, nor ſufficiently depreſſive of <hi>American</hi> freedom.</p>
                        <p>THEREFORE it is, that in this memorable act we find it <hi>expreſsly"</hi> provided," that money ſhall be levied upon us without our conſent, for purpoſes, that render it, <hi>if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> more dreadful than the <hi>Stamp-Act.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THAT act, alarming as it was, declared, the money thereby to be raiſed, ſhould be applied "towards defraying the expences of defending, protecting and ſecuring the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies and plantations in <hi>America:"</hi> And it is evident from the whole act, that by the word <hi>"Britiſh,"</hi> were intended colonies and plantations <hi>ſettled by</hi> Britiſh <hi>people,</hi> and not generally, <hi>thoſe ſubject to the</hi> Britiſh <hi>crown.</hi> That act therefore ſeemed to have ſomething gentle and kind in its intention, and to aim only at <hi>our own welfare:</hi> But the act now objected to, impoſes duties upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies, "to defray the expences of defending, protecting and ſecuring <hi>his Majeſty's</hi> dominions <hi>in</hi> America."</p>
                        <p>WHAT a <hi>change</hi> of words! What an <hi>incomputable addition</hi> to the expences intended by the <hi>Stamp-Act! "His Majeſty's</hi> dominions" comprehend not only <hi>the</hi> Britiſh <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,</hi> but alſo <hi>the conquered provinces of</hi> Canada <hi>and</hi> Florida, <hi>and the</hi> Britiſh <hi>garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of</hi> Nova-Scotia; for <hi>theſe</hi> do not deſerve the name of <hi>colonies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHAT juſtice is there in making US pay for "defending, protecting and ſecuring" <hi>theſe places?</hi> What benefit <hi>can</hi> WE, or <hi>have</hi> WE ever derived <hi>from them?</hi> None of them was conquered <hi>for</hi> US; nor will "be defended, protected or ſecured" <hi>for</hi> US.</p>
                        <p>IN fact, however advantageous the ſubduing or keeping any of theſe countries may be to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the acquiſition is greatly injurious to theſe colonies. Our chief property conſiſts in <hi>lands.</hi> Theſe would have been of much greater value, if ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious additions had not been made to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> territories on this continent. The natural increaſe of our own people, if confined within the colonies, would have raiſed the value ſtill higher every fifteen or twenty years: Beſides, we ſhould have lived more compactly together, and have been therefore more able to reſiſt any enemy.

                           </gap> the conſequences to the colonies, of the hearty aſſiſtance they gave to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in the late war—a war <hi>undertaken ſolely for her own benefit.</hi> The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it were, the ſecuring to herſelf the rich tracts of land on the back of theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, with the <hi>Indian</hi> trade; and <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> with the fiſhery. <hi>Theſe, and much more, has that kingdom gained;</hi> but the <hi>inferior animals,</hi> that hunted with the <hi>lion,</hi> have been amply rewarded for all the ſweat and blood their loyalty coſt them, by the honour of having ſweated and bled in ſuch company.</p>
                        <p>I WILL not go ſo far as to ſay, that <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> are curbs on <hi>New-England;</hi> the <hi>chain of forts</hi> through the back woods on the <hi>Middle Provinces;</hi> and <hi>Florida</hi> on the <hi>reſt:</hi> But I will venture to ſay, that if the products of <hi>Canada, Nova Scotia</hi> and <hi>Florida</hi> deſerve any conſideration, the two firſt of them are only rivals of our northern colonies, and the other of our ſouthern.</p>
                        <p>IT has been ſaid, that without the conqueſt of theſe countries, the colonies could not have been "protected, defended and ſecured." If that is true, it may with as much propriety be ſaid, that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> could not have been "defended, protected and ſecured," without that conqueſt: For the colonies are parts of her empire, which it <hi>as much</hi> concerns <hi>her as them</hi> to keep out of the hands of any other power.</p>
                        <p>BUT theſe colonies, when they were much weaker, defended themſelves, before this conqueſt was made, and could again do it, againſt any that might properly be called <hi>their</hi> ememies. If <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> indeed ſhould attack them, <hi>as members of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>empire,</hi> perhaps they might be diſtreſſed; but it would be in a <hi>Britiſh</hi> quarrel.</p>
                        <p>THE largeſt account I have ſeen of the number of people in <hi>Canada,</hi> does not make them exceed 90, 000. <hi>Florida</hi> can hardly be ſaid to have any inhabitants. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that there are in our colonies 3, 000, 000. <hi>Our</hi> force therefore muſt increaſe with a diſproportion to the growth of <hi>their</hi> ſtrength, that would render us very ſafe.</p>
                        <p>THIS being the ſtate of the caſe, I cannot think it juſt that theſe colonies, labouring under ſo many misfortunes, ſhould be loaded with <hi>taxes,</hi> to maintain countries, not only not uſeful, but hurtful to them. The ſupport of <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Florida</hi> coſt yearly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſaid, half a million ſterling. From hence we may make ſome gueſs of the load that is to be laid <hi>upon</hi> US; for WE are not only to "defend, protect and ſecure" <hi>them,</hi> but alſo to make "an adequate proviſion for defraying the charge of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of juſtice, and the ſupport of civil government, in ſuch provinces where it ſhall be found neceſſary."</p>
                        <p>NOT one of the provinces of <hi>Canada, Nova Scotia,</hi> or <hi>Florida,</hi> has ever defrayed <hi>theſe expences within itſelf:</hi> And if the duties impoſed by the laſt ſtatute are collected, <hi>all of them together,</hi> according to the beſt information I can get, will not pay <hi>one quarter as much as</hi> Pennſylvania <hi>alone.</hi> So that the <hi>Britiſh colonies</hi> are to be drained of the rewards of their labour, to cheriſh the ſcorching ſands of <hi>Florida,</hi> and the icy rocks of <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> which never will return to us one farthing that we ſend to them.</p>

GREAT-BRITAIN—I mean, the Miniſtry in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> has cantoned <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Florida</hi> out into <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> governments, and may form <hi>as many more.</hi> There now are <hi>fourteen</hi> or <hi>fifteen</hi> regiments on this continent; and there ſoon may be <hi>as many more.</hi> To make "an adequate proviſion" <hi>for all theſe expences,</hi> is, no doubt, to be the <hi>inheritance</hi> of the colonies.</p>
                        <p>CAN any man believe that the duties upon paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the <hi>laſt</hi> that will be laid for theſe purpoſes? It is in vain to hope, that becauſe it is imprudent to lay duties on the exportation of manufactures from a Mother country to colonies, as it may promote manufactures among them, that this conſideration will prevent ſuch a meaſure.</p>
                        <p>AMBITIOUS artful men have made it popular, and whatever injuſtice or deſtruction will attend it in the opinion of the coloniſts, at home it will be thought juſt and ſalutary.<note n="*" place="bottom">"So <hi>credulous</hi> as well as <hi>obſtinate,</hi> are the people in believing <hi>every thing,</hi> which flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters their <hi>prevailing paſſion.</hi>

                        <p>I HAVE made ſome obſervations on the <hi>purpoſes</hi> for which money is to be levied upon us by the late act of Parliament.

accompliſhed according to the <hi>expreſſed</hi> intention of the act, they will be found effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to <hi>ſuperſede</hi> that authority in our reſpective Aſſemblies, which is eſſential to liberty. The queſtion is not "whether ſome branches ſhall be lopped off—The axe is laid to the root of the tree; and the whole body muſt infallibly periſh, if we remain idle ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the work.</p>
                        <p>No free people ever exiſted, or can ever exiſt, without keeping, to uſe a common, but ſtrong expreſſion, "the purſe ſtrings," in their own hands. Where this is the caſe, <hi>they</hi> have a <hi>conſtitutional</hi> check upon the Adminiſtration, which may thereby be brought into order <hi>without violence:</hi> But where ſuch a power is not lodged in the <hi>people,</hi> oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion proceeds uncontrouled in its career, till the governed, tranſported into rage, ſeek redreſs in the midſt of blood and confuſion.</p>
                        <p>THE elegant and ingenious Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Anglo Norman</hi> government, ſays—"Princes and Miniſters were too ignorant, to be themſelves ſenſible of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage attending an equitable adminiſtration, and there was no eſtabliſhed Council or <hi>Aſſembly, which could protect the people,</hi> and <hi>by withdrawing ſupplies,</hi> regularly and <hi>peaceably</hi> admoniſh the King of his duty, and <hi>enſure the execution of the laws.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>THUS this great man, whoſe political reflections are ſo much admired, makes <hi>this power</hi> one of the foundations of liberty.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>Engliſh</hi> hiſtory abounds with inſtances, proving that <hi>this</hi> is the proper and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful way to obtain redreſs of grievances. How often have Kings and Miniſters endeavoured to throw off this legal curb upon them, by attempting to raiſe money by a variety of inventions, under pretence of law, without having recourſe to Parliament? And how often have they been brought to reaſon, and peaceably obliged to do juſtice, by the exertion of this conſtitutional authority of the people, veſted in their repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives?</p>
                        <p>THE inhabitants of theſe colonies have, on numberleſs occaſions, reaped the benefit of this authority <hi>lodged in their Aſſemblies.</hi>
                        </p>

THE three moſt important articles that our Aſſemblies, or any legiſlatures can provide for, are, Firſt—the defence of the ſociety: Secondly—the adminiſtration of juſtice: And thirdly—the ſupport of civil government.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING can properly regulate the expence of making proviſion for theſe occaſions, but the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of the ſociety; its <hi>abilities;</hi> the <hi>conveniency</hi> of the modes of levying money in it; the <hi>manner</hi> in which the laws have been executed; and the <hi>conduct</hi> of the officers of government: <hi>All which</hi> are circumſtance, that <hi>cannot</hi> poſſibly be properly <hi>known,</hi> but by the ſociety itſelf; or if they ſhould be known, <hi>will not</hi> probably be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>conſidered</hi> but by that ſociety.</p>
                        <p>IF money be raiſed upon us by <hi>others,</hi> without our conſent, for our "defence," thoſe who are the judges in <hi>levying</hi> it, muſt alſo be the judges in <hi>applying</hi> it. Of conſequence the money <hi>ſaid</hi> to be taken from us for our defence, <hi>may be employed</hi> to our injury. We may be chained in by a line of fortifications—obliged to pay for the building and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them—and be told, that they are for our defence. With what face can we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the fact, after having granted that thoſe who <hi>apply</hi> the money, had a right to <hi>levy</hi> it? For ſurely, it is much eaſier for their wiſdom to underſtand how to apply it in the beſt manner, than how to levy it in the beſt manner. Beſides, the <hi>right of levying</hi> is of infinitely more conſequence, than <hi>that of applying.</hi> The people of <hi>England,</hi> who would burſt out into fury, if the Crown ſhould attempt to <hi>levy</hi> money by its own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, have always aſſigned to the Crown the <hi>application</hi> of money.</p>
                        <p>As to the "adminiſtration of juſtice"—the judges ought, in a well regulated ſtate, to be equally independent of the executive and legiſlative powers. Thus in <hi>England</hi> judges hold their commiſſions from the Crown <hi>"during good behaviour,"</hi> and have ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſuitable to their dignity, <hi>ſettled</hi> on them by Parliament. The purity of the courts of law ſince this eſtabliſhment, is a proof of the wiſdom with which it was made.</p>
                        <p>BUT in theſe colonies, how fruitleſs has been every attempt to have the judges appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>"during good behaviour?"</hi> Yet whoever conſiders the matter will ſoon perceive, that <hi>ſuch commiſſions</hi> are beyond all compariſon more neceſſary in theſe colonies, than they were in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE chief danger to the ſubject <hi>there,</hi> aroſe from the arbitrary <hi>deſigns of the Crown;</hi> but <hi>here,</hi> the time may come, when we may have to contend with the <hi>deſigns of the Crown, and of a mighty kingdom.</hi> What then muſt be chance, when the laws of life and death are to be ſpoken by judges totally dependent on <hi>that Crown,</hi> and <hi>that kingdom</hi>—ſent over perhaps <hi>from thence</hi>—filled with <hi>Britiſh prejudices</hi>—and <hi>backed by a</hi> STANDING <hi>army</hi>—ſupported out of OUR OWN pockets, to "aſſert and maintain" OUR OWN "dependence and obedience."</p>
                        <p>BUT ſuppoſing that through the extreme lenity that will prevail in the government <hi>through all future ages,</hi> theſe colonies will never behold any thing like the campaign of Chief Juſtice <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> yet what innumerable acts of injuſtice may be committed, and how fatally may the principles of liberty be ſapped, by a ſucceſſion of judges <hi>utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the people?</hi> Before ſuch judges, the ſupple wretches, who cheerfully join in avowing ſentiments inconſiſtent with freedom, will always meet with ſmiles; while
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011239_0023_0F8679566406DAC8"/>
the honeſt and brave men, who diſdain to ſacrifice their native land to their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but on every occaſion boldly vindicate her cauſe, will conſtantly be regarded with frowns.</p>
                        <p>THERE are two other conſiderations relating to this head, that deſerve the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention.</p>
                        <p>BY the late act, the officers of the cuſtoms are "impowered to enter into any HOUSE, warehouſe, ſhop, cellar, or other place, in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies or plantations in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> to ſearch for or ſeize prohibited or unaccuſtomed goods, <hi>"&amp;c.</hi> on "writs granted by the ſuperior or ſupreme court of juſtice, having juriſdiction within ſuch colony or plantation reſpectively."</p>
                        <p>IF we only reflect, that the judges of theſe courts are to be <hi>during pleaſure</hi>—that they are to have <hi>"adequate proviſion"</hi> made for them, which is to continue <hi>during their complaiſant behaviour</hi>—that they may be <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to theſe colonies—what an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of oppreſſion may this authority be in ſuch hands?</p>
                        <p>I AM well aware, that writs of this kind may be granted at home, under the ſeal of the Court of Exchequer: But I know alſo, that the greateſt aſſerters of the rights of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> have always ſtrenuouſly contended, that <hi>ſuch a power</hi> was dangerous to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and expreſsly contrary to the common law, which ever regarded a man's <hi>houſe</hi> as his caſtle, or a place of perfect ſecurity.</p>
                        <p>IF ſuch power was in the leaſt degree dangerous <hi>there,</hi> it muſt be utterly deſtructive to liberty <hi>here.</hi> For the people there have two ſecurities againſt the undue exerciſe of this power by the Crown, which are wanting with us, if the late act takes place. In the firſt place, if any injuſtice is done <hi>there,</hi> the perſon injured may bring his action againſt the offender, and have it tried before <hi>independent judges,</hi> who are<note n="*" place="bottom">The writs for ſearching houſes in <hi>England,</hi> are to be granted "under the ſeal of the Court of Exchequer," according to the ſtatute—and that ſeal is kept by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Exchequer. 4 <hi>th Inſt. page</hi> 104.</note> 
                           <hi>no parties in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the injury. Here</hi> he muſt have it tried before <hi>dependent judges,</hi> being the men <hi>who granted the writ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To ſay, that the cauſe is to be tried by a jury, can never reconcile men who have any idea of freedom, to <hi>ſuch a power.</hi> For we know that ſheriffs in almoſt every co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony on this continent, are totally dependent on the Crown; and packing of juries has been frequently practiſed even in the capital of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire. Even if juries are well inclined, we have too many inſtances of the influence of over-bearing unjuſt judges upon them. The brave and wiſe men who accompliſhed the revolution, thought the <hi>independency of judges</hi> eſſential to freedom.</p>
                        <p>THE other ſecurity which the people have at home, but which we ſhall want here, is this.</p>
                        <p>IF this power is abuſed <hi>there,</hi> the Parliament, the grand reſource of the oppreſſed people, is ready to afford relief. Redreſs of grievances muſt precede grants of money. But what regard can <hi>we</hi> expect to have paid to our Aſſemblies, when they will not hold even the puny privilege of <hi>French</hi> Parliaments—that of regiſtering, before they are put in execution, the edicts that take away our money.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="unknown:011239_0024_0F867956B1404E90"/>
THE ſecond conſideration above hinted at, is this. There is a <hi>confuſion</hi> in our laws, that is quite unknown in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> As this cannot be deſcribed in a more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> or exact manner, than has been done by the ingenious author of the hiſtory of <hi>New York,</hi> I beg leave to uſe his words. "The ſtate of our laws opens a door to much controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. The <hi>uncertainty,</hi> with reſpect to them, <hi>renders property precarious, and greatly expoſes us to the arbitrary deciſion of bad judges.</hi> The common law of <hi>England</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received, together with ſuch ſtatutes as were enacted before we had a legiſlature of our own; but our courts <hi>exerciſe a ſovereign authority,</hi> in determining <hi>what parts of the common and ſtatute law</hi> ought to be extended: For it muſt be admitted, that the <hi>difference of circumſtances</hi> neceſſarily requires us, in ſome caſes, <hi>to</hi> REJECT <hi>the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of both.</hi> In many inſtances, they have alſo extended even acts of Parliament, paſſed ſince we had a diſtinct legiſlature, <hi>which is greatly adding to our confuſion.</hi> The practice of our courts is no leſs <hi>uncertain</hi> than the law. Some of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> rules are adopted, others rejected. Two things therefore ſeem to be <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> for the <hi>public ſecurity.</hi> Firſt, the paſſing an act for ſettling the extent of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> laws. Secondly, that the courts ordain a general ſet of rules for the regulation of the practice."</p>
                        <p>How eaſy it will be, under this "ſtate of our laws," for an artful judge, to act in the moſt arbitrary manner, and yet cover his conduct under ſpecious pretences; and how difficult it will be for the injured people to obtain relief, may be readily perceived. We may take a voyage of 3000 miles to complain; and after the trouble and hazard we have undergone, we may be told, that the collection of the revenue, and maintenance of the prerogative, muſt not be diſcouraged—and if the miſbehaviour is ſo groſs as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no juſtification, it may be ſaid, that it was an error in judgment only, ariſing from the confuſion of our laws, and the zeal of the King's ſervants to do their duty.</p>
                        <p>IF the commiſſions of judges are <hi>during the pleaſure of the Crown,</hi> yet if their ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are <hi>during the pleaſure of the people,</hi> there will be <hi>ſome check</hi> upon their conduct. Few men will conſent to draw on themſelves the hatred and contempt of thoſe among whom they live, for the empty honour of being judges. It is the forbid love of gain, that tempts men to turn their backs on virtue, and pay their homage where they ought not.</p>
                        <p>As to the third particular, "the ſupport of civil government,"—few words will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. Every man of the leaſt underſtanding muſt know, that the <hi>executive</hi> power may be exerciſed in a manner ſo diſagreeable and harraſſing to the people, that it is abſolutely requiſite, that <hi>they</hi> ſhould be enabled by the gentleſt method which human policy has yet been ingenious enough to invent, that is, <hi>by ſhutting their hands,</hi> to "ADMONISH" (as Mr. <hi>Hume</hi> ſays) certain perſons <hi>"of their duty."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHAT ſhall we now think when, upon looking into the late act, we find the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of theſe provinces thereby ſtript of their authority <hi>on theſe ſeveral heads?</hi> The <hi>declared</hi> intention of the act is, "that a revenue ſhould be raiſed <hi>in his Majeſty's</hi> DOMINIONS <hi>in America,</hi> for making a more certain and adequate proviſion <hi>for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying the charge of the adminiſtration of juſtice,</hi> and <hi>the ſupport of civil government</hi>

in ſuch provinces where it ſhall be found neceſſary, and <hi>towards further defraying the expences of defending, protecting and ſecuring the</hi> SAID DOMINIONS."</p>
                        <p>LET the reader pauſe here one moment—and reflect—whether the colony in which <hi>he</hi> lives, has not made ſuch "certain and adequate proviſion" <hi>for theſe purpoſes,</hi> as is <hi>by the colony judged suitable to its abilties, and all other circumstances.</hi> Then let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect—whether if this act takes place, money is not to be raiſed on <hi>that</hi> colony <hi>without its conſent,</hi> to make "proviſion" <hi>for theſe purpoſes,</hi> which <hi>it does not judge to be ſuitable to its abilities, and all other circumſtances.</hi> Laſtly, let him reflect—whether <hi>be taken from them</hi> under the notion of right, <hi>when they have refuſed to give it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>FOR my part, I think I have good reaſon for vindicating the honour of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies on this continent, by publicly aſſerting, that THEY <hi>have made as "certain and adequate proviſion" for the purpoſes abovementioned, as they ought to have made,</hi> and that it ſhould not be preſumed, that they will not do it hereafter. Why then ſhould <hi>theſe moſt important truſts</hi> be wreſted out of their hands? Why ſhould they not now be permitted to enjoy that authority, which they have exerciſed from the firſt ſettlement of theſe colonies? Why ſhould they be ſcandalized by this innovation, when their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective provinces are now, and will be, for ſeveral years, labouring under loads of debt, impoſed on them for the very purpoſe now ſpoken of? Why ſhould all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of theſe colonies be, with the utmoſt indignity, treated as a herd of deſpicable ſtupid wretches, ſo utterly void of common ſenſe, that they will not even make "ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate proviſion" for the "adminiſtration of juſtice, and the ſupport of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment" among them, or for their own "defence"—though without ſuch "proviſion" every people muſt inevitably be overwhelmed with anarchy and deſtruction? Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to form an idea of a ſlavery more <hi>compleat,</hi> more <hi>miſerable,</hi> more <hi>diſgraceful</hi> than that of a people, where <hi>juſtice is adminiſtered, government exerciſed,</hi> and a <hi>ſtanding army maintained, at the expence of the people,</hi> and yet <hi>without the leaſt dependence upon them?</hi> If we can find to relief from this infamous ſituation, it will be fortunate for us, if Mr. <hi>Grenville,</hi> ſetting his fertile fancy again at work, can, as by one exertion of it he has ſtript us of our <hi>property</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> by another deprive us of ſo much of our <hi>underſtanding,</hi> that, unconſcious of what we <hi>have been</hi> or <hi>are,</hi> and ungoaded by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting reflections, we may bow down our necks, with all the ſtupid ſerenity of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to any drudgery, which our lords and maſters ſhall pleaſe to command.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the charges of the "adminiſtration of juſtice," the "ſupport of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," and the expences of "defending, protecting and ſecuring" us, are provided for, I ſhould be glad to know, upon <hi>what occaſions</hi> the Crown will ever call our Aſſemblies together. Some few of them may meet of their own accord, by virtue of their charters. But what will they have to do, when they are met? To what ſhadows will they be reduced? The men, whoſe deliberations heretofore had an influence on every matter relating to the <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of themſelves and their conſtituents, and whoſe authority in domeſtic affairs at leaſt, might well be compared to that of <hi>Roman</hi> ſenators, will <hi>now</hi> find their deliberations of no more conſequence, than thoſe of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables</hi>
                           <pb n="38" facs="unknown:011239_0025_0F86795B9E896DB8"/>
They may <hi>perhaps</hi> be allowed to make laws <hi>for the yoking of hogs,</hi> or <hi>pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſtray cattle.</hi> Their influence will hardly be permitted to extend <hi>ſo high,</hi> as the <hi>keeping roads in repair,</hi> as <hi>that buſineſs</hi> may more properly be executed by thoſe who receive the public caſh.</p>
                        <p>ONE moſt memorable example in hiſtory is ſo applicable to the point now inſiſted on, that it will form a juſt concluſion of the obſervations that have been made.</p>
                        <p>SPAIN was once <hi>free.</hi> Their <hi>Cortes</hi> reſembled our Parliaments.

                              <p>An enquiry into the legality of penſions on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> eſtabliſhment, by <hi>Alexander M'Auly,</hi>

                              <p>Mr. <hi>M'Auly</hi> concludes his piece in the following beautiful manner. "If any <hi>penſions</hi> have been obtained on that eſtabliſhment, <hi>to ſerve the corrupt purpoſes of ambitious men.</hi>—If his Majeſty's revenues of <hi>Ireland</hi> have been employed in penſions, <hi>to debauch his Majeſty's ſubjects</hi> of both kingdoms.—If the treaſure of <hi>Ireland</hi> has been expended in penſions, <hi>for corrupting men of that kingdom to betray their country;</hi> and men of the neighbouring kingdom, to betray both.—If <hi>Iriſh</hi> penſions have been procured, <hi>to ſupport gameſters and gaming-houſes;</hi> promoting a vice which threatens national ruin.—If penſions have been purloined out of the national treaſure of <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the <hi>maſk of ſalaries annexed to public offices, uſeleſs to the nation;</hi> newly invented, <hi>for the purpoſes of corruption.</hi>—If <hi>Ireland,</hi> juſt beginning to recover from the devaſtations of maſſacre and rebellion, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the progreſs of her cure, <hi>by ſwarms of penſionary vultures preying on her vitals.</hi>—If, by ſquandering the national ſubſtance of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in a <hi>licentious, unbounded profuſion of penſions,</hi> inſtead of employing it in nouriſhing and improving her infant <hi>agriculture, trade</hi> and <hi>manufactures,</hi> or in <hi>enlightening</hi> and <hi>reforming</hi> her <hi>poor, ignorant, deluded, miſerable natives</hi> (by nature moſt amiable, moſt valuable, moſt worthy of public attention)—If, <hi>by ſuch abuſe of the national ſubſtance, ſloth</hi> and <hi>naſtineſs, cold</hi> and <hi>hunger, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>wretchedneſs, popery, depopulation</hi> and <hi>barbariſm,</hi> ſtill maintain their ground; <hi>ſtill deform a country, abounding with all the riches of nature,</hi> yet hitherto deſtined to beggary.—If <hi>ſuch penſions</hi> be found on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> eſtabliſhment; let ſuch be cut off: And let the perfidious adviſers be branded with indelible characters of public infamy; adequate, if poſſible, to the diſhonour of their crime."</p>
                           </note>THE revenue of the Crown there ariſes principally from the Exciſe granted <hi>"for pay of the army, and defraying other</hi> PUBLIC <hi>charges, in defence and preſervation of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011239_0026_0F86795CCE3FDF78"/>
the kingdom"</hi>—from the tonnage and additional poundage granted <hi>"for protecting the trade of the kingdom at ſea, and augmenting the</hi> PUBLIC <hi>revenue"</hi>—from the hearth money granted—as a "PUBLIC <hi>revenue, for</hi> PUBLIC <hi>charges and expences."</hi> There are ſome other branches of the revenue, concerning which there is not any <hi>expreſs</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation of them for PUBLIC <hi>ſervice,</hi> but which were plainly <hi>ſo intended.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>OF <hi>theſe</hi> branches of the revenue the Crown is only <hi>truſtee</hi> for the Public. They are unalienable. They are inapplicable to any other purpoſes, but thoſe for which they were eſtabliſhed; and therefore are not <hi>legally</hi> chargeable with penſions.</p>
                        <p>THERE is another kind of revenue, which is a private revenue. This is not limited to any public uſes; but the Crown has the ſame property in it, that any perſon has in his eſtate. This does not amount, at the moſt, to <hi>fifteen thouſand pounds</hi> a year, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not to <hi>ſeven,</hi> and is the only revenue, that can be <hi>legally</hi> charged with penſions.</p>
                        <p>IF Miniſters were accuſtomed to regard the rights or happineſs of the people, the penſions in <hi>Ireland</hi> would not exceed the ſum juſt mentioned: But long ſince have they exceeded that limit; and in <hi>December</hi> 1765, a motion was made in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in that kingdom, to addreſs his Majeſty on the great increaſe of penſions on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> eſtabliſhment, amounting to the ſum of 158, 685 l. in the laſt two years.</p>
                        <p>ATTEMPTS have been made to gloſs over theſe groſs encroachments, by this ſpecious argument—"That expending a competent part of the <hi>public revenue</hi> in penſions, from a principle of charity or generoſity, adds to the dignity of the Crown; and is <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> uſeful to the <hi>public.</hi>" To give this argument any weight, it muſt appear, that the penſions proceed from <hi>"charity</hi> or <hi>generoſity</hi> only"—and that it "adds to the dignity of the Crown," <hi>to act directly contrary to law.</hi>—</p>
                        <p>FROM this conduct towards <hi>Ireland,</hi> in open violation of law, we may eaſily foreſee what <hi>we</hi> may expect, when a Miniſter will have the <hi>whole revenue</hi> of <hi>America</hi> in his own hands, to be diſpoſed of at his own pleaſure: For <hi>all</hi> the monies raiſed by the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011239_0026_0F86795CCE3FDF78"/>
late act are to be <hi>"applied</hi> by virtue of warrants under the ſign manual, counterſigned by the High Treaſurer, or any three of the commiſſioners of the Treaſury." The RESIDUE indeed is to be "paid into the receipt of the Exchequer, and to be diſpoſed of by Parliament." So that a Miniſter will have nothing to do, but to take care, that there ſhall be no <hi>reſidue,</hi> and he is ſuperior to all controul.</p>
                        <p>BESIDES the burden of <hi>penſions</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which have enormouſly encreaſed within theſe few years, almoſt all the <hi>offices</hi> in that poor kingdom, have been, ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the preſent century, and now are beſtowed upon <hi>ſtrangers.</hi> For though the merit of perſons born there, juſtly raiſes them to places of high truſt when they go abroad, as all <hi>Europe</hi> can witneſs, yet he is an uncommonly lucky <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> who can get a good poſt in <hi>his</hi> NATIVE <hi>country.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHEN I conſider the manner<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>In <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's time, the Houſe of Commons, influenced by ſome factious demagogues, were reſolved to prohibit the importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> cattle into <hi>England.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other arguments in favour of <hi>Ireland</hi> it was inſiſted—"That by cutting off almoſt entirely the trade between the kingdoms, <hi>all the natural bands of union were diſſolved,</hi> and nothing remained to keep the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their duty, but <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence.</hi>"</p>
                              <p>"The King (ſays Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi>) was ſo convinced of the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe reaſons, that he uſed all his intereſt to oppoſe the bill, and he openly declared, that he could not give his aſſent to it with a ſafe conſcience. But the Commons were reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in their purpoſe."—"And the ſpirit of <hi>tyranny, of which nations are as ſuſceptible as individuals,</hi> had animated the <hi>Engliſh</hi> extremely <hi>to exert their ſuperiority over their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſtate.</hi> No affair could be conducted with greater violence than this by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. They even went ſo far in the preamble of the bill, as to declare the importation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> cattle to be a <hi>nuſance.</hi> By this expreſſion they gave ſcope to their <hi>paſſion,</hi> and at the ſame time <hi>barred the King's prerogative,</hi> by which he might think himſelf intitled to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with a law, <hi>ſo full of injuſtice and bad policy.</hi> The Lords expunged the word, but as the King was ſenſible that no ſupply would be given by the Commons, unleſs they were gratified in all their <hi>prejudices,</hi> he was obliged both to employ his intereſt with the Peers, to make the bill paſs, and to give the Royal aſſent to it. He could not, however, forbear expreſſing his diſpleaſure, at the jealouſy entertained againſt him, and at the intention which the Commons diſcovered, of retrenching his prerogative.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>This law brought great diſtreſs for ſome time upon Ireland, but it has occaſioned their applying with greater induſtry to manufactures, and has proved in the iſſue beneficial to that kingdom.</hi>"</p>
                              <p>Perhaps the <hi>ſame reaſon</hi> occaſioned the "barring the King's prerogative" in the late act ſuſpending the legiſlation of <hi>New-York.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>This we may be aſſured of, that <hi>we</hi> are as dear to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as the people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> are. <hi>We</hi> are his <hi>ſubjects</hi> as well as they, and <hi>as faithful ſubjects;</hi> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has given too many, too conſtant proofs of his piety and virtue, for any man to think it poſſible, that <hi>ſuch a Prince</hi> can make any unjuſt diſtinction between <hi>ſuch ſubjects.</hi> It makes no difference to his Majeſty, whether ſupplies are raiſed in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi> but it makes <hi>ſome</hi> difference to the Commons of that kingdom.</p>
                              <p>To ſpeak plainly, as becomes an honeſt man on ſuch important occaſions, all our miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are owing to a <hi>luſt of power</hi> in men of <hi>abilities</hi> and <hi>influence.</hi> This prompts them to ſeek <hi>popularity</hi> by <hi>expedients</hi> profitable to themſelves, though ever ſo deſtructive to their country.</p>

                              <p>I am informed, that within theſe few years, a petition was preſented to the Houſe of Commons, ſetting forth "that herrings were imported into <hi>Ireland</hi> from ſome foreign parts of the north ſo cheap, as to diſcourage the <hi>Britiſh</hi> herring fiſhery, and therefore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome remedy might be applied in that behalf by Parliament."—</p>
                              <p>That upon this petition, the Houſe came to a reſolution, to impoſe a duty of Two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſterling on every barrel of foreign herrings imported into <hi>Ireland;</hi> but afterwards dropt the affair, <hi>for fear of engaging in a diſpute with Ireland about the right of</hi> TAXING <hi>her.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>So much higher was the opinion, which the Houſe entertained of the ſpirit of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than of that of theſe colonies.</p>
                              <p>I find, in the laſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> papers, that the reſolution and firmneſs with which the people of <hi>Ireland</hi> have lately aſſerted their freedom, have been ſo alarming in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that the Lord Lieutenant, in his ſpeech on the 20th of laſt <hi>October,</hi> "recommended to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that ſuch proviſion may be made for ſecuring the Judges in the enjoyment of their <hi>offices</hi> and <hi>appointments, during their good behaviour,</hi> as ſhall be thought moſt expedient."</p>
                              <p>What an important conceſſion is thus obtained, by making demands becoming freemen, with a courage and perſeverance becoming freemen!</p>
                           </note> of a people, who have preſerved the ſacred fire of freedom from being extinguiſhed, though the altar on which it burnt, has been overturned.</p>
                        <p>IN the ſame manner ſhall we unqueſtionably be treated, as ſoon as the late taxes laid upon us, ſhall make poſts in the "government," and the "adminiſtration of juſtice" <hi>here,</hi> worth the attention of perſons of influence in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> We know enough already to ſatisfy us of this truth.

                        <p>THE <hi>principals,</hi> in all great offices, will reſide in <hi>England,</hi> making ſome paltry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to deputies for doing the buſineſs <hi>here.</hi> Let any man conſider what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting drain this muſt be upon us, when Miniſters are poſſeſſed of the power of creating what poſts they pleaſe, and of affixing to ſuch poſts what ſalaries they pleaſe, and he muſt be convinced how deſtructive the late act will be. The injured kingdom lately mentioned, can tell us the miſchiefs of ABSENTEES; and we may perceive already the ſame diſpoſition taking place with us. The government of <hi>New-York</hi> has been exerciſed by a deputy. That of <hi>Virginia</hi> is now held ſo; and we know of a number of ſecretary-ſhips, collectorſhips, and other offices, held in the ſame manner.</p>

TRUE it is, that if the people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> were not too much blinded by the paſſions, that have been artfully excited in their breaſts, againſt their dutiful children the coloniſts, theſe conſiderations would be nearly as alarming to them as to us. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Crown was thought by wiſe men, many years ago, too great, by reaſon of the multitude of penſions and places beſtowed by it. Theſe have been vaſtly encreaſed ſince<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>One of the reaſons urged by that great and honeſt ſtateſman, Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, in his famous remonſtrance, to diſſuade him from aiming at arbitrary power, was, that the King "had few offices to beſtow.<hi>"Hume'</hi>s Hiſt. of <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>"Tho' the wings of prerogative have been clipt, the influence of the Crown is greater than ever it was in any period of our hiſtory. For when we conſider in how many boroughs the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has the votes at command; when we conſider the vaſt body of perſons employed in the collection of the revenue, in every part of the kingdom, the inconceivable number of placemen, and candidates for places in the cuſtoms, in the exciſe, in the poſt-office, in the dock-yards, in the ordnance, in the ſalt-office, in the ſtamps, in the navy and victualling offices, and in a variety of other departments; when we conſider again the extenſive influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the money corporations, ſubſcription jobbers and contractors, the endleſs depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies created by the obligations conferred on the bulk of the Gentlemens families through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdom, who have relations preferred in our navy and numerous ſtanding army; when I ſay, we conſider how wide, how binding a dependence on the Crown is created by the above enumerated particulars, and the great, the enormous weight and influence which the Crown derives from this extenſive dependence upon its favour and power, any Lord in waiting, any Lord of the Bedchamber, any man may be appointed Miniſter."</p>
                              <p>A doctrine to this effect is ſaid to have been the advice of L—H—. <hi>Late Newſpaper.</hi>

                           </note>, and perhaps it would be no difficult matter to prove that the people have decreaſed.</p>
                        <p>SURELY therefore, thoſe who wiſh the welfare of their country, ought ſeriouſly to reflect, what may be the conſequence of ſuch a new creation of offices, in the diſpoſal of the Crown. The <hi>army,</hi> the <hi>adminiſtration of juſtice,</hi> and the <hi>civil government</hi> here, with ſuch ſalaries as the Crown ſhall pleaſe to annex, will extend <hi>Miniſterial influence</hi> as much beyond its former bounds, as the late war did the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions.</p>
                        <p>BUT whatever the people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> may think on this occaſion, I hope the people of theſe colonies will unanimouſly join in this ſentiment, that the late act of Parliament is injurious to their liberty, and that this ſentiment will unite them in a firm oppoſition to it, in the ſame manner as the dread of the <hi>Stamp-Act</hi> did.</p>
                        <p>SOME perſons may imagine the ſums to be raiſed by it, are but ſmall, and therefore may be inclined to acquieſce under it.

                        <p>TAXES in every free ſtate have been, and ought to be, as exactly <hi>proportioned as is poſſible to the abilities of thoſe who are to pay them.</hi> They cannot otherwiſe be <hi>juſt.</hi> Even a <hi>Hottentot</hi> would comprehend the <hi>unreaſonableneſs</hi> of making a poor man pay as much for "defending" the property of a rich man, as the rich man pays himſelf.</p>
                        <p>LET any perſon look into the late act of Parliament, and he will immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the immenſe eſtates of Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi>

                              <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> have been engaged in the warmeſt diſputes, in order to obtain an equal and juſt taxation of their Proprietors eſtates: But this late act of Parliament does more for thoſe Proprietors, than they themſelves would venture to demand. It <hi>total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exempts</hi> them from taxation—tho' their vaſt eſtates are to be "ſecured" by the taxes of other people.</note>, and our <hi>Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> which are amongſt his Majeſty's other <hi>DOMINIONS</hi> to be "defended, protected and ſecured" by the act, will not pay a ſingle farthing for the duties thereby impoſed, except Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> wants ſome of his windows glazed; Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> and our <hi>Proprietaries</hi> are quite ſecure, as they live in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I MENTION theſe particular caſes, as ſtriking inſtances how far the late act is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from <hi>that principle of juſtice,</hi> which has ſo conſtantly diſtinguiſhed our own laws on this continent, and ought to be regarded in all laws.</p>
                        <p>THE third conſideration with our continental Aſſemblies in laying taxes, has been the <hi>method</hi> of collecting them. This has been done by a few officers, with moderate allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, under the inſpection of the reſpective Aſſemblies. <hi>No more was raiſed from the ſubject,</hi> than was uſed for the intended purpoſes. But by the late act, a Miniſter may appoint <hi>as many officers as he pleaſes</hi> for collecting the taxes; may aſſign them <hi>what ſalaries he thinks</hi> "adequate;" and they are ſubject to <hi>no inſpection but his own.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IN ſhort, if the late act of Parliament takes effect, theſe colonies muſt dwindle down into <hi>"common corporations, "</hi> as their enemies, in the debates concerning the repeal of

the <hi>Stamp-Act, ſtrenuouſly inſiſted they were;</hi> and it ſeems not improbable that ſome future hiſtorian may thus record our fall.</p>
                        <p>"THE eighth year of this reign was diſtinguiſhed by <hi>a very memorable event,</hi> the <hi>American</hi> colonies then ſubmitting, for the <hi>FIRST</hi> time, to be <hi>taxed</hi> by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament. An attempt of this kind had been made about two years before, but was defeated by the vigorous exertions of the ſeveral provinces, in defence of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Their behaviour on that occaſion rendered their name very celebrated <hi>for a ſhort time</hi> all over <hi>Europe;</hi> all ſtates being extremely attentive to a diſpute between <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and ſo conſiderable a part of her dominions. For as ſhe was thought to be grown too powerful, by the ſucceſsful concluſion of the late war ſhe had been engaged in, it was hoped, by many, that as it had happened before to other kingdoms, civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords would afford opportunities of revenging all the injuries ſuppoſed to be received from her. However, the cauſe of diſſention was removed, by a repeal of the ſtatute that had given offence. This affair rendered the <hi>ſubmiſſive conduct</hi> of the colonies ſo ſoon after, the more extraordinary; there being <hi>no difference</hi> between the mode of taxation which they oppoſed, and that to which they ſubmitted, but this, that by the firſt, they were to be continually <hi>reminded</hi> that they <hi>were taxed,</hi> by certain marks <hi>ſtamped</hi> on every piece of paper or parchment they uſed. The authors of <hi>that ſtatute</hi> triumphed greatly on this conduct of the colonies, and inſiſted, that if the people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> had perſiſted in enforcing it, the <hi>Americans</hi> would have been, in a few months, <hi>ſo fatigued with the efforts of patriotiſm,</hi> that they would have yielded obedience.</p>
                        <p>"CERTAIN it is, that though they had before their eyes <hi>ſo many illuſtrious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> in their Mother country, of the <hi>conſtant ſucceſs</hi> attending <hi>firmneſs</hi> and <hi>perſeverance,</hi> in oppoſition to dangerous encroachments on liberty, yet they quietly gave up a point of the <hi>"laſt importance."</hi> From thence the decline of their freedom began, and its decay was extremely rapid; for as <hi>money</hi> was always raiſed upon them by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> grew immediately <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> and in a ſhort time <hi>contemptible:</hi> And in leſs than one hundred years, the people ſunk down into that <hi>tameneſs</hi> and <hi>ſupineneſs</hi> of ſpirit, by which they ſtill continue to be diſtinguiſhed."</p>

A PERPETUAL <hi>jealouſy,</hi> reſpecting liberty, is abſolutely requiſite in all free ſtates. The very texture of their conſtitution, in <hi>mixt</hi> governments, demands it.

But of all ſtates that have exiſted, there never was any, in which this jealouſy could be more proper than in theſe colonies. For the government here is not only <hi>mixt,</hi> but <hi>dependent,</hi> which circumſtance occaſions <hi>a peculiarity in its form,</hi> of a very delicate nature.</p>
                        <p>Two reaſons induce me to deſire, that this ſpirit of apprehenſion may be always kept up among us, in its utmoſt vigilance. The firſt is this—that as the happineſs of theſe provinces indubitably conſiſts in their connection with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> any ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between them is leſs likely to be occaſioned by civil diſcords, if every diſguſting meaſure is oppoſed <hi>ſingly,</hi> and <hi>while it is new:</hi> For in this manner of proceeding, every ſuch meaſure is moſt likely to be rectified. On the other hand, oppreſſions and diſſatisfactions being permitted to accumulate—<hi>if ever</hi> the governed throw off the load, <hi>they will do more.</hi> A people does not reform with moderation. The rights of the ſubject therefore cannot be <hi>too often</hi> conſidered, explained or aſſerted: And whoever attempts to do this, ſhews himſelf, whatever may be the raſh and peeviſh reflections of pretended wiſdom, and pretended duty, a friend to <hi>thoſe</hi> who injudiciouſly exerciſe their power, as well as to <hi>them,</hi> over whom it is ſo exerciſed.</p>
                        <p>HAD all the points of prerogative claimed by Charles the Firſt, been ſeparately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted and ſettled in preceding reigns, his fate would in all probability have been very different; and the people would have been content with that liberty which is compatible with regal authority. But<note n="†" place="bottom">The author is ſenſible that this is putting the gentleſt conſtruction on <hi>Charles'</hi>s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and that is one reaſon why he chooſes it. Allowances ought to be made for the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of thoſe men, who are acknowledged to have been poſſeſſed of many virtues. The education of this unhappy prince, and his confidence in men not ſo good or wiſe as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had probably <hi>filled</hi> him with miſtaken notions of his own authority, and of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that would attend conceſſions of any kind to a people, who were repreſented to him, as aiming at too much power.</note> he thought, it would be as dangerous for him to give up the powers which at any time had been by uſurpation exerciſed by the Crown, as thoſe that were legally veſted in it. This produced an equal exceſs on the part of the people. For when their paſſions were excited by <hi>multiplied</hi> grievances, they thought it would be as dangerous for them to allow the powers that were legally veſted in the Crown, as thoſe which at any time had been by uſurpation exerciſed by it. Acts, that might <hi>by themſelves</hi> have been upon many conſiderations excuſed or extenuated, derived a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious malignancy and odium from other acts, with which they were connected. They were not regarded according to the ſimple force of each, but as parts of a ſyſtem of oppreſſion. Every one therefore, however ſmall in itſelf, became alarming, as an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional evidence of tyrannical deſigns. It was in vain for prudent and moderate men to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011239_0029_0F86795FB8D30710"/>
inſiſt, that there was no neceſſity to aboliſh Royalty. Nothing leſs than the utter deſtruction of monarchy, could ſatisfy thoſe who <hi>had</hi> ſuffered, and thought they had reaſon to believe, they always <hi>ſhould</hi> ſuffer under it.</p>
                        <p>THE conſequences of theſe mutual diſtruſts are well known: But there is no other people mentioned in hiſtory, that I recollect, who have been ſo conſtantly watchful of their liberty, and ſo ſucceſsful in their ſtruggles for it, as the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leads me to the ſecond reaſon, why I "deſire that the ſpirit of apprehenſion may be always kept up among us in its utmoſt vigilance."</p>

The power or profit that ariſes from theſe violations, <hi>centering in few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> is to them conſiderable. For this reaſon the <hi>governors,</hi> having in view their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular purpoſes, ſucceſſively preſerve an uniformity of conduct for attaining them. They regularly encreaſe the firſt injuries, till at length the inattentive people are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to perceive the heavineſs of their burthens.—They begin to complain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire—but too late. They find their oppreſſors ſo ſtrengthened by ſucceſs, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo entangled in examples of expreſs authority on the part of their rulers, and of tacit recognition on their own part, that they are quite confounded: For millions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain no other idea of the <hi>legality</hi> of power, than that it is founded on the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of power. They voluntarily faſten their chains, by adopting a puſillanimous <hi>opinion,</hi> "that there will be too much <hi>danger</hi> in attempting a remedy,"—or another <hi>opinion</hi> no leſs fatal,—"that the government has a <hi>right</hi> to treat them as it does." They then ſeek a wretched relief for their minds, by perſuading themſelves, that to yield their <hi>odedience,</hi> is to diſcharge their <hi>duty.</hi> The deplorable <hi>poverty of ſpirit,</hi> that proſtrates all the dignity beſtowed by Divine Providence on our nature—<hi>of courſe ſucceeds.</hi>

                        <p>FROM theſe reflections I conclude, that every free ſtate ſhould inceſſantly watch, and inſtantly take alarm on any addition being made to the power exerciſed over them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable inſtances might be produced to ſhew, from what ſlight beginnings the moſt extenſive conſequences have flowed: But I ſhall ſelect two only from the hiſtory of <hi>England.</hi>

                        <p>IT is true, that a ſtrong ſpirit of liberty ſubſiſts at preſent in <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> but what reliance is to be placed in the <hi>temper</hi> of a people, when the Prince is poſſeſſed of an unconſtitional power, our own hiſtory can ſufficiently inform us.

                        <p>PUBLIC diſguſting acts are ſeldom practiſed by the ambitious, at the beginning of their deſigns.

                        <p>BY the late act of Parliament, taxes are to be levied upon us, for "defraying the charge of the <hi>adminiſtration of juſtice</hi>—the ſupport of <hi>civil government</hi>—and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of <hi>defending</hi> his Majeſty's dominions in <hi>America.</hi>"</p>

                        <p>Has not the Parliament <hi>expreſsly</hi> AVOWED their INTENTION of raiſing money from us <hi>for certain purpoſes?</hi> Is not this ſcheme <hi>popular</hi> in <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> Will the taxes, impoſed by the late act, <hi>anſwer thoſe purpoſes?</hi> If it will, muſt it not take an <hi>immenſe ſum</hi> from us?

Will not every additional tax therefore render it <hi>more difficult</hi> to abrogate any of them? When a branch of revenue is once eſtabliſhed, does it not appear to many people <hi>invidious</hi> and <hi>undutiful,</hi> to attempt to aboliſh it? If taxes, ſufficient to <hi>accompliſh the</hi> INTENTION of the Parliament, are impoſed by the Parliament, <hi>what taxes will remain</hi> to be impoſed by our Aſſemblies? If <hi>no material taxes remain</hi> to be impoſed by them, what muſt become of <hi>them,</hi> and the <hi>people</hi> they repreſent?</p>

                        <p>ONE other argument is to be added, which, by itſelf, I hope, will be ſufficient to convince the moſt incredulous man on this continent, that the late act of Parliament is <hi>only</hi> deſigned to be a PRECEDENT, whereon the future vaſſalage of theſe colonies may be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                        <p>EVERY duty thereby laid on articles of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufacture, is laid on ſome commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, upon the exportation of which from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> a <hi>drawback</hi> is payable. Thoſe

                           </gap>. The Parliament therefore might, in <hi>half a dozen lines,</hi> have raiſed <hi>much more money,</hi> only by <hi>ſtopping the drawbacks</hi> in the hands of the officers at home, on exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe colonies, than by this ſolemn impoſition of taxes upon us, to be collected here. Probably, the artful contrivers of this act formed it in this manner; in order to reſerve to themſelves, in caſe of any objections being made to it, this ſpecious pretence—"that the drawbacks are gifts to the colonies, and that the late act only leſſens thoſe gifts." But the truth is, that the drawbacks are intended for the encouragement and promotion of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures and commerce, and are allowed on exportation to <hi>any foreign parts,</hi> as well as on exportation to theſe provinces. Beſides, care has been taken to ſlide into the act, ſome articles on which there are no drawbacks. However, the <hi>whole duties</hi> laid by the late act on <hi>all</hi> the articles therein ſpecified are <hi>ſo ſmall,</hi> that they will not amount to <hi>as much</hi> as the <hi>drawbacks</hi> which are allowed on <hi>part</hi> of them only. If therefore, <hi>the ſum to be obtained by the late act,</hi> had been the <hi>ſole object</hi> in forming it, there would not have been any occaſion for "the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to <hi>give</hi> and <hi>grant</hi> to his Majeſty <hi>rates</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> for <hi>raiſing a revenue</hi> IN <hi>his Majeſty's dominions</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> for making a more certain and adequate proviſion for defraying the charges of the adminiſtration of juſtice, the ſupport of civil government, and the expence of defending the ſaid dominions;"—nor would there have been any occaſion for an<note n="†" place="bottom">

Yet how many are there, ſo <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ſordid</hi> as to <hi>think</hi> they perform <hi>all the offices of life,</hi> if they earneſtly endeavour to encreaſe their own <hi>wealth, power,</hi> and <hi>credit,</hi> without the leaſt regard for the ſociety, under the protection of which they live; who, if they can make an <hi>immediate profit to themſelves,</hi> by lending their aſſiſtance to thoſe, whoſe projects plainly tend to the injury of their country, rejoice in their <hi>dexterity,</hi> and believe themſelves entitled to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>able politicians.</hi> Miſerable men! Of whom it is hard to ſay, whether they ought to be moſt the objects of <hi>pity</hi> or <hi>contempt.</hi> But whoſe opinions are certainly as <hi>deteſtable,</hi> as their practices are <hi>deſtructive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THOUGH I always reflect, with a high pleaſure, on the integrity and underſtanding of my countrymen, which, joined with a pure and humble devotion to the great and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous author of every bleſſing they enjoy, will, I hope, enſure to them, and their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all temporal and eternal happineſs; yet when I conſider, that in every age and country there have been bad men, my heart, at this threatening period, is ſo full of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, as not to permit me to believe, but that there may be ſome on this continent, <hi>againſt whom you ought to be upon your guard</hi>—Men, who either<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>It is not intended, by theſe words, to throw any reflection upon Gentlemen, becauſe they are poſſeſſed of offices: For many of them are certainly men of virtue, and lovers of their country. But ſuppoſed obligations of <hi>gratitude,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> may induce them to be ſilent. Whether theſe obligations <hi>ought to be</hi> regarded or not, is not ſo much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by others, in the judgment they form of theſe Gentlemen, as whether <hi>they think</hi> they ought to be regarded. Perhaps, therefore, we ſhall act in the propereſt manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, if we neither <hi>reproach</hi> nor <hi>imitate</hi> them. The perſons meant in this letter, are the <hi>baſe ſpirited wretches,</hi> who may endeavour to <hi>diſtinguiſh themſelves,</hi> by their fordid zeal in defending and promoting meaſures, which <hi>they know, beyond all queſtion,</hi> to be <hi>deſtructive</hi> to the <hi>juſt rights</hi> and <hi>true intereſts</hi> of their country. It is ſcarcely poſſible to s;peak of <hi>theſe men</hi> with any degree of <hi>patience</hi>—It is ſcarcely poſſible to ſpeak of them with any degree of <hi>propriety</hi>—For no words can truly deſcribe their <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>meanneſs</hi>—But every honeſt boſom, on their being mentioned, will <hi>feel</hi> what cannot be <hi>expreſſed.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Grenville,</hi> indeed, in order to recommend the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> had the <hi>unequalled</hi> generoſity, to pour down a golden ſhower of offices upon <hi>Americans;</hi> and yet theſe <hi>ungrateful</hi> colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies did not thank Mr. <hi>Grenville</hi> for ſhewing his kindneſs to their countrymen, nor <hi>them</hi> for accepting it. How muſt that great ſtateſman have been ſurpriſed, to find, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſhed colonies could not be reconciled to <hi>infamy</hi> by <hi>treachery?</hi> Such a <hi>bountiful</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition towards us never appeared in any Miniſter before him, and probably never will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear again: For it is <hi>evident,</hi> that <hi>ſuch a ſyſtem</hi> of policy is to be eſtabliſhed on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, as, in a ſhort time, is to render it utterly unneceſſary to uſe the leaſt <hi>art</hi> in order to <hi>conciliate</hi> our approbation of any meaſures.

                              <p>For my part, I regard <hi>Great-Britain</hi> as a <hi>bulwark,</hi> happily fixed between theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and the powerful nations of <hi>Europe.</hi> That kingdom remaining ſafe, we, under its protection, enjoying peace, may diffuſe the bleſſings of religion, ſcience, and liberty, thro' remote wilderneſſes. It is therefore inconteſtibly our <hi>duty,</hi> and our <hi>intereſt,</hi> to ſupport the ſtrength of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> When conſiding in that ſtrength, ſhe begins to forget from whence it aroſe, it will be an eaſy thing to ſhew the ſource.

There are ſome other reflections on this ſubject, worthy of the moſt deliberate attention of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament; but they are of ſuch a nature, that I do not chooſe to mention them publicly.

Well might Mr. <hi>Townſhend</hi> ſay, when he preſented this bill to the Houſe, <hi>that the</hi> Americans <hi>would raiſe no ſtatues to him;</hi> for he knew the baleful tendency of it to their deareſt rights. His words, however, furniſh us a very ſalutary hint, which we ſhould not neglect. They manifeſt his expectation, that we ſhould feel its injuries ſo as to make us execrate its author.</p>
               <p>IN this manner was the great plan of diviſion accompliſhed, in this manner our enemies have purpoſed our final ruin. For to ſpeak in the words of the great Sir <hi>Thomas Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> on a ſimilar occaſion, in the time of <hi>Charles,</hi> the Firſt, <hi>They have taken from us, what? What ſhall I ſay? Indeed what have they left us? They have raviſhed from us all means of ſupplying the King, and ingratiating ourſelves with him, taking up the root of all property.</hi> If the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> over which we have no earthly reſtriction, may give and grant our property for the purpoſe of a revenue, in whatever manner it be affected, the root of all our property is effectually taken up, and we at beſt are but tenants at will.

               <p>THE evil being known, what ſhall be the remedy? I ſhall offer my ſentiments in a few words.

               <p>A SENTIMENT which breathes ſo pure and exalted a ſenſe of freedom, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſlavery, could hardly have ariſen in a mind not enobled by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of liberty, in a free ſtate. <hi>Cicero,</hi> in this our motto, calls <hi>ſlavery the worſt of all evils;</hi> for in his ſhort acquaintance with it, he had ſeen it extinguiſh all thoſe virtues, which had made <hi>Rome</hi> the habitation of heroes, and the miſtreſs of the world; nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their place ſuch vices as were moſt deteſtable, and plainly ominous of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, which they ſpeedily produced.</p>
               <p>It would be the greateſt happineſs to which I could attain, to <hi>impreſs upon the minds of my countrymen, a love of liberty, and hatred of ſlavery, ſo indelible as to render it impoſſible to ſix chains upon them, by whomſoever forged.</hi> And though the poorneſs of my abilities, inadequate, very inadequate to ſo glorious an end, ſhould fruſtrate the completion of my wiſh, yet will the intention, I hope, paſs uncenſured. <hi>Pulchrum eſt benifacere reipublicoe, etiam benedicere haud abſurdum.</hi>

               <p>LIBERTY, the life and ſoul of great purſuits, of noble actions, enlarges the heart and ſtimulates the underſtanding. In times of liberty, a man depends upon himſelf, his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, integrity, ſpirit, ingenuity, and every virtue have incentives to kindle and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them, a proper field to diſplay themſelves, and to operate to his own emolument and his country's glory. Whether his natural inclination be to the field or the cabinet, to philoſophy, or arts, he purſues it with an ardour, which conſcious freedom always inſpires, and which cannot but crown him with diſtinguiſhed ſucceſs. But when ſlavery has ſpread its baneful influence over a people, the minds of men are ſubdued and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated; they depend on their tyrants for what they are pleaſed to grant them, property, or life or honours, to which they aſpire, not by virtue, but by cunning, ſervility and wickedneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>TO the many and great authorities which I adduced in my laſt, to prove the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable connection between liberty and happineſs in a ſtate, I have now ſubjoined this ſentiment of my Lord <hi>Bolingbroke.</hi> I therefore preſume no one will queſtion that poſition: Indeed I even hope there are few of my countrymen who want much proof to evince a truth, which is, as it were, graved on the heart of every freeman. The end of government is the good of the majority; and when it is diverted to the emolument of one or a few, it then becomes bad, it then becomes, deteſted be the name, it then becomes a tyranny. When this is veſted in one, as in an unlimited monarchy, it is bad, but much more is it to be dreaded when in the hands of many. Thus the Decemviri at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Thirty at <hi>Athens,</hi> the Doge and Senate at <hi>Venice,</hi> were more woeful tyrannies than even that of the Grand Signior; and the moſt tremendous tyranny that ever exiſted would be the Houſe of Commons in <hi>England,</hi> if it were independent of the people; that is, if the ſeats were for life; filled up when vacant by the members themſelves, and they not affected by the laws they made. If they made a law to take away the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people, their own would be untouched; if to endanger the lives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they themſelves would not feel its ſeverity. From the dreadful calamities of ſuch a form of government, if perſiſted in, there could be no hope of relief but from that which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> calls <hi>an appeal to Heaven. The people,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have by a law, antecedent and paramount to all poſitive laws of man, reſerved that ultimate determination to themſelves, which belongs to all mankind, when there lies no appeal on earth, namely, to make their appeal to Heaven, that is, to the ſword; and this judgment they cannot part with.</hi> The reader will obſerve, I am ſuppoſing what is called the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to be no longer elected by the people, and therefore no longer their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;

or ſuppoſe the Houſe of Lords ſhould ſay to the people of <hi>England,</hi> we are your <hi>virtual</hi> repreſentatives, and therefore have a right to tax you; ſuppoſe they were, upon this declaration, to tax them accordingly; what would the people ſay? They would tell their Lordſhips that they poſſeſſed, and, have ever poſſeſſed, a right by the conſtitution, an unalienable right to <hi>chuſe</hi> repreſentatives, who are their truſtees, <hi>and are bound in duty and intereſt to preſerve their liberty</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See debates in Parliament, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1704. <hi>p.</hi> 221. The rights of the people are ſafer in the hands of their repreſentatives than any other; if they do not like them, they can turn them out, and chuſe new ones; but they cannot do ſo in the caſe of the Lords. Mr. <hi>Lowndes'</hi>s ſpeech, Ibid. p. 66.</note> 
                  <hi>and property;</hi> with theſe therefore, and theſe only, they would truſt their property, and not with their Lordſhips, over whom they had no ſuch reſtriction; ſhould the Lords perſiſt, the people would without doubt make their laſt appeal to Heaven. There would not be wanting ſome, who would ſtile this rebellion; but (I ſpeak the words of Mr. <hi>Sidney) they who ſeek after truth will find, that there can be no ſuch thing in the world as the rebellion of a whole nation againſt its magiſtrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT I have dwelt too long, perhaps, in ſuppoſing miſeries, to which I hope the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> will never be reduced; that is, I hope they never will taſte of the bitter cup of ſlavery, which they are forcing upon us. When I began this paper, it was with an intention of admoniſhing my countrymen, or rather lamenting with them on the woeful proſpect before us. Our <hi>privileges</hi> are all <hi>virtual,</hi> our ſufferings are <hi>real.</hi> We have freeholds, and I read, in the addreſs of the Lords to Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> that "the <hi>right of election,</hi> is a <hi>legal intereſt, incident to the freehold,</hi> or founded upon cuſtom, or the letters patent of your Majeſty's Royal anceſtors, or upon particular acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Now nobody can think, but that the right to elect a Parliament man, which is a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing character from the vulgar, and hath its weight in the legiſlature, is a privilege; and therefore to be deprived of it, is to be deprived not only of a burden or ſervice, but of a very valuable privilege: And I believe any <hi>Engliſhman</hi> would think we dealt very hardly by him, to deprive him of it, though we ſhould tell him at the ſame time we deprived him only of a ſervice or burden, not of a valuable privilege.</p>

                  </note>;" but our freeholds are all <hi>virtually included in the manor of</hi> Greenwich; is then the authority exerciſed over the ſame virtual freehold in <hi>Greenwich?</hi> Alas! No. When we are to be taxed, we are in <hi>America;</hi> when duties are laid upon the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities we purchaſe from <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> when our governments are to be ſuſpended, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we will be humble, complying, unmurmuring, very, very ſlaves, we are then <hi>in America;</hi> but when we are to <hi>chuſe our repreſentatives,</hi> our truſtees, who are bound thereby in duty and intereſt to treat us with the ſame juſtice and tenderneſs, with which they would treat themſelves, then, my countrymen, we are unhappily in the <hi>manor of</hi> Greenwich. Thus, I <hi>John Thomas,</hi> of the county of <hi>Richmond,</hi> in <hi>Virginia,</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, do vote without knowing it, for a burgeſs in the manor of <hi>Greenwich,</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which manor I never ſaw, nor indeed ever heard of before, to lay a duty upon the glaſs I want to mend my windows in my tenement, on my freehold, in <hi>Richmond</hi>

How does this great man ſoar above thoſe weakneſſes that govern mankind on this earth; truth, juſtice, wiſdom, law, and right? It was not until his compleat triumph over theſe human weakneſſes, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>America</hi> repreſented in the manor of <hi>Greenwich;</hi> but who is the repreſentative? Does he know us? Or we him? No. Have we any reſtriction over his conduct? No. Is he bound in duty and intereſt to preſerve our liberty and property? No. Is he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our circumſtances, ſituation, wants, &amp;c.? No. What then are we to expect from him? Nothing but taxes without end. Unhappy people! We are fallen into that deplorable ſtate in which I ſuppoſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would be, were they taxed by thoſe whom they did not elect. So vitally injurious would ſuch a power be to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that people, that ſuch of their Kings as were tyrannically diſpoſed, have, through the whole courſe of their hiſtory, been endeavouring to accompliſh it; but ſo ſenſible were the people of its importance, that they as conſtantly reclaimed that right by their repreſentatives; till the bill of rights ſuppreſſed entirely all ſuch attempts. Thus, Mr. <hi>Petit,</hi> in his <hi>Jus Parliamentarum,</hi> aſſerts that never any impoſition was ſet on by the King out of Parliament, but what was complained of in Parliament; and not one that ever ſtood after ſuch complaint, but remedy was afforded for it. Even when the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament attempted to tax a part of <hi>Britain,</hi> which it did not actually repreſent; the violation of liberty was perceived, reclaimed againſt, and redreſſed. And that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of ſuch proceedings might ſtand recorded to all futurity, it is ſet forth in the ſtatutes 34 and 5, H. VIII, in theſe words, "that the inhabitants of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Cheſter,</hi> having neither Knight ne Burgeſs in the Parliament of <hi>Weſtminſter, for the lack thereof</hi> have been oftimes <hi>touched</hi> and <hi>grieved</hi> with acts and ſtatutes, made within the ſaid court, <hi>as well derogatory unto the moſt antient juriſdictions, liberties and privileges of your ſaid county palatine</hi> (and of <hi>Durham) as prejudicial unto the commonwealth, quietneſs, reſt and peace of your Grace's moſt bounded ſubjects inhabiting in the ſame.</hi>" Such was the ſacred reverence paid to the rights and liberties of the ſubject! But if the people of the counties of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Cheſter,</hi> ſo nearly connected with thoſe who voted for the repreſentative, whoſe circumſtances might ſo eaſily be known, were yet touched and grieved by the acts of that repreſentative; how much more ſhall we be injured, who are remote, unknown, unfriended, unſopported? Shall we not be touched to the quick? Shall we not be grieved to the heart? Will not our juriſdictions, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and privileges, be totally violated? Shall we not ſink into ſlaves? O liberty! O virtue! O my country!</p>
               <p>My Lord CAMDEN has juſtly and emphatically obſerved, that there <hi>is not a blade of graſs in</hi> Great-Britain <hi>but what is repreſented;</hi> for what unheard of crime is it,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011239_0041_0F86796DCFA40740"/>
that not a blade of graſs in <hi>America</hi> is repreſented? What can prevent us from being treated with all the ſeverity which the cruel rapacity of a wicked Miniſter may dictate, If we be once ſubjected to an authority unlimited and unreſtrained? Every needy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the Miniſter will be immediately provided for in <hi>America,</hi> new places will be framed, new, endleſs, and inſupportable taxes will be laid upon us, for their ſupport, rendering us the ſlaves of ſlaves. When Sir <hi>Robert Walpole</hi> was endeavouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the exciſe in <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pulteney,</hi> after having ſhewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I can conceive that it would give the malignant heart of <hi>Grenville</hi> infinite pleaſure, to be thus avenged by ſending his <hi>foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to tread upon the necks, and grind the faces of thoſe people,</hi> whoſe ſpirit once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed his oppreſſive purpoſes; and held him up to infamy and cotempt. Some perhaps may flatter themſelves, this will never be the caſe; but I would aſk them, on what ground they cheriſh this hope, or where is the ſecurity in this new model of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, againſt all the ignominy and evils of tyranny? For it is moſt certain that wicked Miniſters do frequently exiſt, and that a government (as Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> has before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) is not only a tyranny when tyrannically exerciſed; but alſo when there is no ſufficient caution in the conſtitution that it may not be uſed tyrannically<note n="†" place="bottom">Political Works, p. 108.</note>. Where is this caution in ours?</p>
               <p>LET me then again exhort my countrymen, <hi>over the whole continent, that they inſtruct their repreſentatives to draw up a petition of rights, and never deſiſt from the ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation till it be confirmed into a bill of rights.</hi> Then, and then only, will there be truly ſuch a thing as <hi>American</hi> freedom; then oly ſhall we be ſafe from thoſe ills which ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny pours down upon its wretched vaſſals. From which, may GOD of his infinite mercy, preſerve us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. S.</hi> As the right of election is the very pillar of our conſtitution; I hope the following explanation of it, by Sir <hi>Joſeph Jekyll,</hi> a very learned and able lawyer, will not be unacceptable. I take the right, ſays he, of every elector in <hi>England</hi> to accrue to him by the common law, for he is under one or other theſe qualifications: Either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is a freeholder, and then he has a right to vote for knights of the ſhi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e; or he has a right by charter, or a right by preſcription; which two laſt rights take in the right of noting in all cities and boroughs. Now I would be glad to know whether the right of a freeholder is not by the common law? Whether a right by charter is not by common law? Is it not that law that enables the Crown to grant charters and qualifies that power? Whether a right by preſcription is not by the common law? Is not preſcription
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011239_0042_0F86796EEF390510"/>
common uſage? And is the common law any thing but common uſage? The freeholder's right of voting is of the eſſence of his freehold, and you may as well take away his freehold, as take away the right of voting, which he has by virtue of that freehold, &amp;c. Now I proceed to obſerve, that were the Houſe of Commons in <hi>England</hi> our real repreſentative, they could not, of right, either take away, or did in taking away from us this right; for this right of election, being the very pillar of our conſtitution, it cannot be removed without deſtruction to the conſtitution itſelf, and ſurely the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative is choſen not to ſubvert or aid in ſubverting, but to ſupport the conſtitution; and it manifeſtly is the higheſt inconſiſtency to ſuppoſe the people would chuſe truſtees to take from them that very right by which they choſe them. It is a right which the people cannot give away, it is truly a divine right, prior and paramount to all laws, and which may be modelled, but cannot be reſigned. How truly contemptible then, how throughly wicked is that <hi>Grenvillean</hi> idea, that a virtual repreſentative can rightfully take the privilege of electing from the people of <hi>America?</hi>

               <p>IN my preceding papers, I have endeavoured to warn my countrymen of the danger that threatens their liberties. I have proved, from the ſentiments of the greateſt men of all ages, and from the hiſtories of nations, how neceſſarily virtue, happineſs and ſtrength, attend a free government; and that weakneſs, vice, ignominy and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, are the unavoidable concomitants of ſlavery. I have farther taken the liberty of ſuggeſting to my countrymen, the neceſſity of <hi>inſtructing their repreſentatives to petition to our moſt Gracious Sovereign againſt the late acts of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Parliament; which are deſtructive of the rights and liberties of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>colonies in</hi> America. And I ſhall now proceed to offer the outlines of the inſtructions, which it is incumbent on the people, as they value the liberty their forefathers bequeathed them, to give their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives.</p>
               <p>1. That we the freeholders or electors of the—country or—borough, are fully ſenſible, that the privilege, which we have always poſſeſſed, of electing our own repreſentatives, to raiſe taxes, or levy money upon us, as the exigencies of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall require, and we are able to ſupply, is eſſentially neceſſary to our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: So that without this privilege, we muſt inevitably be ſlaves.</p>
               <p>2. That we regard every attempt to take this privilege from us, or to injure us for not reſigning it, as in the higheſt manner oppreſſive and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:011239_0042_0F86795EEF390510"/>
3. That we conſider ſuch attempts made upon any one colony, equally intereſting to every <hi>Britiſh</hi> colony in <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. We therefore recommend it to you, in the moſt earneſt manner, by the regard you have for our liberties and rights, with which we have now intruſted you, to do your utmoſt in the next Aſſembly, towards having petitions drawn up to our moſt Gracious King againſt the late acts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, for billeting ſoldiers in <hi>America,</hi> for ſuſpending the government of <hi>New-York</hi> and for laying certain duties, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of raiſing money on glaſs, paper, paint, &amp;c. imported into <hi>America</hi> from <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. We think, and ſhall always think, that any impoſitions whatever laid upon us by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, which does not and cannot repreſent us, are abſolutely deſtructive of our liberty.</p>
               <p>6. We therefore recommend it to you, that you endeavour to have <hi>theſe our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents formed into a petition of rights;</hi> or in any other manner that ſhall ſeem, to your wiſdom, moſt proper to procure their being eſtabliſhed into <hi>a bill of rights;</hi> to the end that we may no more be alarmed with invaſions of our liberties, but reſt in peace, each man under his own vine, and each man under his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ig-tree.</p>
               <p>7. We again heartily recommend the utmoſt attention to theſe our moſt important concerns; and we promiſe to ſupport you, in the proſecution of theſe meaſures, to the utmoſt of our abilities.</p>
               <p>Theſe I think are the neceſſary heads of the inſtructions, which ought to be given to all the repreſentatives of the people in <hi>America.</hi> They ſpecify what we feel to be our rights, and what have been the invaſions of them; they recommend to our repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, to petition againſt theſe violations, and to endeavour the preventing them for the future; laſtly, they promiſe them a juſt ſupport in this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>It has been objected to this method of petitioning, that it will probably be ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; and this ſuppoſition is founded upon the fate of our petitions and remonſtrances againſt the <hi>Stamp-Act.</hi> The diſregard they met with, it is thought, will fall upon theſe, But I muſt beg leave to think there is no validity in this objection; becauſe the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of things is entirely altered. The affairs of <hi>America</hi> were <hi>then</hi> neither at all underſtood; nor in the leaſt regarded. I remember to have heard ſome conſiderable members ſay in the lobby, during the debates on the repeal of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> that, though they were in the Houſe when it firſt paſſed, yet they did not pay ſo much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reading as to hear what the bill contained. It is not ſo <hi>now;</hi> the affairs of <hi>America</hi> have become the object of national attention; and I am confident, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> petitions will not be again treated ſo cavalierly, nay, I would venture to aſſert, that no Miniſter will dare to imitate the violence of Mr. <hi>Grenville,</hi> in ſuppreſſing or withholding theſe petitions. I muſt obſerve further on this head, that two things more contributed to the rendering thoſe petitions abortive; one was, that the colonies were not by any means unanimous in ſending them; the other was, that either through want of proper Inſtructions, or though neglect of them, the affair was not properly managed at home, VIRGI<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>A was, I think, the only colony that remonſtrated and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011239_0043_0F8679712B63B638"/>
petitioned at firſt; few only did ſo at all; and therefore the general ſenſe of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, expreſſed by their Aſſemblies, will hardly meet with the ſame fate. Either no inſtructions were ſent, directing our remonſtrances and petitions to be made public, or they were not complied with in time; and this omiſſion had the fatal effect of prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the people of <hi>England</hi> againſt our proceedings. They thought us violent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectful in making ſuch ſpirited reſolves, and oppoſing the execution of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> without previouſly petitioning againſt it. Innumerable times did I hear this ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt the <hi>Americans;</hi> which would not have happened, had our remonſtrances and petitions been made public. The people of <hi>England</hi> are candid, juſt, and generous; under the influence of paſſion, they may act repugnant to this character, but otherwiſe I am confident they never will; I am confident they will applaud our conduct, when they perceive we are vindicating our liberties, in a reſpectful, tho' firm and ſpirited manner, in the manner that they themſelves began to reclaim their own, in the time of <hi>James</hi> I. The voice of the people of <hi>England</hi> has that weight with the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the voice of every free people ought to have; it has great weight; and therefore care ſhould be taken to render it favourable, which a fair appeal to them, will, in conſequence of that nobleneſs of nature which diſtinguiſhes them, generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I do not wiſh to injure thoſe Gentlemen who ſerve the colonies as agents; but it is notorious, that many of them were our enemies in the affair of the <hi>Stamp-Act:</hi> ſome of them, I know, were outrageouſly ſuch. I think it my Duty to admoniſh my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this, that they may not truſt theſe very important concerns to thoſe, who, from the nature of things, cannot be ſufficiently intereſted in them, and of whoſe abilities we cannot be proper judges. I ſubmit it to their conſideration, whether we might not reaſonably expect more ſucceſs from men choſen from among ourſelves; on whoſe known wiſdom, integrity and ſpirit, we might ſafely roly.</p>
               <p>I WILL beg the reader to indulge me a little longer, while I touch upon the right of conſtituents to inſtruct their repreſentatives. It has been lately denied that they have ſuch a right. I ſay, lately, that is, ſince the ſyſtem of corruption, which is now arrived at ſo dangerous a heighth, began firſt to predominate in our conſtitution. Then it was, that arbitrary Miniſters, and their proſtituted dependents, began to maintain this doctrine, dangerous to our liberty, that the repreſentatives were independent of the people. This was neceſſary to ſerve their own tyrannical and ſelfiſh purpoſes; it was therefore called by Sir <hi>John Barnard</hi> and others, <hi>a new and wicked Doctrine:</hi> "It is, Sir," ſaid Sir <hi>William Wyndh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>em,</hi> "not only a new doctrine, but it is the moſt monſtrous, the moſt flaviſh doctrine, that was ever heard, and ſuch a doctrine as I hope no man will ever dare to ſupport within theſe walls.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the debates on the ſeptennial bill, 1734.</note>."</p>
               <p>MY Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in his inſtitutes, ſays, "it is alſo a law and cuſtom of Parliament, that when any new device is moved in the King's behalf in Parliament, for his aid, or the like, the Commons may anſwer, that they tendered the King's eſtate, and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aid the ſame, only in this new device they <hi>dare not agree without conference with their countries;</hi> whereby it appeareth that ſuch conference is warrantable by the law
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011239_0043_0F8679712B63B638"/>
and cuſtom of Parliament." He has cited an inſtance of this in the Parliament held the 9th of <hi>Edward</hi> III. and Mr. <hi>Petit,</hi> in his <hi>Jus Parliamentarium,</hi> has given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother precedent of it in the 13th year of the ſame reign. It appears then, that by the conſtitution, the repreſentatives ought not to agree to any new device, before they have taken the ſentiments of their conſtituents; and why agree to any old device? Becauſe they are ſuppoſed to have received already the inſtructions of the people. The conſtitution therefore ſuppoſes the Knight or Burgeſs always to receive the inſtructions of his conſtituents, before he acts; and ſurely, when theſe are received, it would be the higheſt abſurdity to ſuppoſe the member was not bound by them, for this would be to ſet the opinion and intereſts of one man againſt thoſe of thouſands; which would be abſurd, ruinous, and unjuſt. It is, without queſtion, but common juſtice, that they who are to feel the effects of any meaſure, ſhould direct in the conduct of it, otherwiſe they would be ſlaves and wretched tools; the repreſentatives are <hi>truſtees for their conſtituents,</hi> to tranſact for them the buſineſs of government; and therefore I preſume it is, that the writ runs, to <hi>ſerve</hi> in Parliament; and for this <hi>ſervice,</hi> they, like all other agents, were paid by their conſtituents; 'til they found it more advantageous to fell their voices in Parliament, and then it was they broached this monſtrous doctrine, and wiſhed to become independent of the people. I hope the origin of this opinion will ſuffice to condemn it; the right of the people to inſtruct, muſt have began with the conſtitution, becauſe it is neceſſary to that freedom which is the eſſence of it, and is founded in the laws of juſtice, which are eternal and immutable; and when this right is taken from us, we may juſtly complain, as <hi>Demeſthenes</hi> did for the <hi>Athenians,</hi> "that the <hi>repreſentative</hi> has now uſurped the right of the people, and exerciſes an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary authority over his antient and natural lord<note n="*" place="bottom">See his third Olynthian.</note>." Nor is there any one inſtance in which the people have abuſed this right, or reaſon to apprehend they will ever do it; they act from what they feel; and when that feeling is general, it muſt be real:</p>
               <p>"The Nobility and Gentry," ſays Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> "have ſo many private expectations, and particular intereſts, that hang like a falſe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>FOR theſe reaſons, I hold it to be an antient and unalienable right in the people, to inſtruct their repreſentatives; nor has it any weight with me, that Mr. <hi>Blackſtone,</hi> in his commentary on the law of <hi>England,</hi> has aſſerted the contrary; ſince he founds his opinion on that fiction, of a perſon's being, after he is elected, the repreſentative of the whole kingdom, and not of a particular part. The ſophiſtry of this argument is ſufficiently manifeſt, and has been fully exploded. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution is not to be new-modelled by every <hi>Court</hi> Lawyer<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Blackſtone</hi> is Solicitor to the Queen.</note>; any more than the liberties of <hi>America</hi>

               <p>WHEN I earneſtly recommend to my countrymen in <hi>America,</hi> the inſtructing their <hi>real repreſentatives</hi> to petition to our moſt Gracious Sovereign againſt thoſe late acts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, which infringe our liberties, and for a confirmation of thoſe rights, which we have hitherto uninterruptedly poſſeſſed, I comply perfectly, in my judgment, with the profeſſion made in this motto. For theſe acts tending to make all property among us precarious, to expoſe us to vice, violence and contempt, are but too manifeſtly inconſiſtent with our ſtrength or welfare; and a confirmation of our rights, would eſtabliſh them on a ſure and ſolid foundation, ſo as to merit the title of the <hi>Magna Charta Americana.</hi> What were the means, by which our forefathers in <hi>England</hi> obtained their <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> I do not ſtop here to enquire; it is privileges which they had long enjoyed; and what was therefore in juſtice their due. The rights we claim, have been our uninterrupted poſſeſſion for upwards of an hundred years. I ſay uninterrupted; for otherwiſe our rights are as old as the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution, ſince we are the direct and lineal deſcendants of <hi>Britons.</hi> Our <hi>American</hi> forefathers had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no absolute occaſion for charters to confirm their liberties to us their deſcendants, as it muſt have been concluded that we were in courſe entitled to them; but they juſtly conſidered, that a poſſeſſion ſo dear as liberty could not be guarded with too much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. This conſideration is a ſufficient anſwer to thoſe, who conclude our privileges to be null and void, becauſe they were held from the Royal charter; which, ſay they, it is not in the power of prerogative to grant<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Lords proteſt againſt the repeal of the <hi>Stamp-Act.</hi>
                  </note> theſe charters are not grants of new rights, but in confirmation of old ones; nor is it worth diſputing whether prerogative <hi>could</hi> grant them; it would be enough for us, that prerogative <hi>did</hi> grant them, that the Parliament <hi>acquieſced</hi> in the grant, and that the free people of <hi>Britain acted under the ſecurity</hi>

But this ſuppoſition, wretched as it is, will become ſtill more contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when we reflect, that the laſt of theſe charters was granted in the reign of <hi>George</hi> the Second, when there remained little doubt concerning the nature of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the liberties of the people, or the power of prerogative, ſince the bill of rigths had, long before that period, fixed them upon the ſame determined principles by which they have ever ſince been governed. And this laſt charter, has reſerved to the <hi>Americans</hi> the ſame privileges, and in the ſame words, as hath the firſt in the reign of <hi>James</hi> the Firſt. What? Were all the Parliaments, from that period to this, aſleep, that they ſuffered prerogative thus to uſurp their rights; till <hi>Grenville</hi> and his patriotic party awakened this Parliament to reclaim them?</p>
               <p>OF the ſame leaven is that ſuppoſition, that theſe liberties were never intended or thought of in thoſe charters<note n="†" place="bottom">See the proteſt.</note>. Have words then no meaning, or are they to give up their meaning, like we our liberties, to pleaſe the accompliſhed Mr. <hi>Grenville?</hi> The words are reſerving to the <hi>Americans,</hi> the privileges, immunities, franchiſes and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, as if born within the realm of <hi>Britain.</hi> Could words ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, ſo poſitive as theſe, be without meaning? Could they fail being perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by thoſe who granted and thoſe who received the charters? To imagine then that the firſt ſettlers did not underſtand theſe words, in the ſenſe of giving their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty by their own conſent, expreſſed by themſelves, or their repreſentatives, which was the well known ground of <hi>Britiſh</hi> liberty, when, agreeably to this acceptation, they immediately choſe repreſentatives to tax them, and who have continued ſolely to lay impoſitions upon them, is a ſuppoſition that deſerves only to be mentioned, that it may be deſpiſed. It is like all the reſt of <hi>Grenville'</hi>s ſophiſtry, moſt contemptible; indeed I have often lamented, that Mr. <hi>Grenville'</hi>s ſpeech, in ſupport of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> was not printed, as well as Mr. <hi>Pitt'</hi>s againſt it. The wretched ſophiſtry, with which he endeavoured to prove the legitimacy of his hideous offspring, ſeemed to me the ſtrongaſt mark of its being ſpurious. How ſtrange, how very ſtrange it is, that a wiſe, a free, a generous people, ſhould ever have been influenced by a man, who never, in any one act of his adminiſtration, ſhewed either wiſdom or virtue; and whoſe chief charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic, is the being obſtinately wedded to his own weak, confined and wicked politics! Strange that they do not ſee their own liberties embarked in the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When our rights are thus plain and indubitable, our caſe becomes general, and <hi>Britain</hi> her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is intereſted in the ſupport of it: Whenever our liberties are laid low, their rights

and privileges will not be be of long duration; whenever any impious man ſhall dare to impoſe ſhackles upon us, their hands will not long remain unſettered.</p>
               <p>The liberties then of our forefathers, were coeval with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution, they were confirmed by various Kings, and recognized by various Parliaments; we then my countrymen are free: And let us tell our brethren in <hi>Britain,</hi> that we are free; let us tell it with a ſpirit becoming thoſe who claim ſo noble a brotherhood; with a <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſpirit, than which a nobler never yet animated a free people!</p>
               <p>IN looking forward, to the very probable conſequences of a peaceable acquieſcence under the late aſſumed authority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, I ſhudder with apprehenſion. Our <hi>money</hi> only is ſeized upon now, to <hi>relieve the debt of Great-Britain;</hi> and will not our <hi>youth</hi> be ravaged from us next to <hi>fight</hi> her battles, in the fields of <hi>Germany,</hi> or in the <hi>Indian</hi> ocean? Will not a preſs-gang be our next ſcourge? I ſee already men torn from their weeping and diſtreſſed families, without hope, without redreſs, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, by an unrelenting, lawleſs crew, unbridled by our own civil and legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and wantonly cruel in the execution of deſpotic power. I ſee every endearing tie of father, huſband, ſon and brother, torn aſunder, unreſpited, unpitied, unrepriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſee my weeping country, worn down with reiterated ſorrows and alarms, implor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aid, peace, reſpite, or revenge: Alas! In vain, her youthful ſons are now no more, fallen in foreign wars and on unhoſpitable ſhores; nothing but feeble age remains to mix his unavailing tears with hers. Gods! Are we men, and ſhall we ſuffer the foundation to be laid for miſeries like theſe; ſhall we look tamely on while the yoke is fixed upon us, under which we muſt for ever groan? We and our poſterity forever. Shall we thus devote ourſelves and them to the malice of private lurking informers, and the hateful inſults of petty authority; to be hunted like beaſts of prey, like murderers and felons; our property, our liberty, our happineſs given up to Miniſters, who having grown ſavage in the exerciſe of deſpotiſm, ſhall contrive for us new hardſhips, new op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and tyrannize without meaſure, without fear, without mercy. Even in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Miniſter has been found daring and wicked enough to propoſe in Parliament, that authority ſhould be given to the officers of preſs-gangs of break into any houſe, and at any time, and carry off any one who was ſaid to be a ſailor, to make it puniſhable for any one to conceal ſuch men, and to put them to their own oath, to prove the facts for which they were to ſuffer. And this bill, fraught as it was with cruelty and oppreſſion, could hardly be rejected by the univerſal indignation expreſſed againſt it, by all the efforts of patriotiſm and powers of eloquence, ſuch as even <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> never excelled. What ſhall we then, who are unrepreſented, unfriended and unheard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? Shall we hope a Miniſter ſo wicked and ſo daring will never live? Vain hope, even now he lives. Mr. <hi>Pitt'</hi>s ſpeech informs us that Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> daring and wicked as he was, did not dare to tax <hi>America.</hi> But he who has dared, has wickedly dared to tax her, lives ſtill, he lives to ſee his meaſures adopted, aſſerted and executed; and he may live to propoſe ſucceſsfully <hi>an impreſs bill for America.</hi> When ſuch a bill, tyrannical in itſelf, and parental of tyranny in others, giving conſidence to the arrogant, and ſecurity to the cruel, ſhall have paſſed; then muſt we prepare to ſee our property

               <p>WHY, my friend, ſaid a Gentleman the other day, do you employ your time in writing on Liberty, which may poſſibly bring you into ſome difficulties or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; when you might uſe it ſo much more to your own emolument?—Becauſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is the very idol of my ſoul, the parent of virtue, the nurſe, of heroes, the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of general happineſs; becauſe ſlavery is the monſtrous mother of every abominable vice, and every atrocious ill; becauſe the liberties of my country are invaded, and in danger of entire deſtruction, by the late acts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament; becauſe I would with joy be the ſacrifice to the re-eſtabliſhment of them, upon a ſure and ſolid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Very many there are, infinitely more able than myſelf, to ſupport the rights of their country, and why they comply not with this moſt cogent of all duties, I cannot divine. Perhaps they think not with me, that it is the duty of every man to pay the tribute of <hi>ſpeaking out,</hi> to his country; to rouſe the ſpirit of Liberty, to proteſt againſt what he cannot prevent, and claim, without ceaſing, what he cannot by his own ſtrength recover. And, ſurely no mortal can aſpire to a higher ſtation, or to greater

glory, than that of being, on every occaſion, the ſupport of good, the controul of bad government, and the guardian of public liberty.</p>
               <p>WHEN I conſider the willingneſs and alacrity with which the people reſign the greateſt part of the fruits of their labour, for the eaſe and luxury, of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; for which they expect, in neturn, protection to their perſons, and ſecurity in the free uſe of the remaining pittance; I am fired with indignation at the ingratitude and wickedenſs of thoſe who, envying them the free enjoyment even of that pittance, would urge them ſtill further, endeavour arbitrarily to extort from them the laſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and have their perſons at devotion, who would put ſaddles upon the backs, and bridles in the mouths of the reſt of the community, that they themſelves might ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpur and goad them, as the wantonneſs of vice, the inſatiability of avarice, or the atrociouſneſs of cruelty may ſuggeſt.

That we may be reined and ſpurred at will, that our properties, our lives, and every thing that is dear and ſacred among men, may be at the abſolute diſpoſal of thoſe, who, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under any controul from us, under any neceſſity to treat us with tenderneſs and prudence, will have all the incitements that can urge men, inflamed by power, miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Is any imagination capable of conceiving a people more abſolute, more abject ſlaves, than when they are taxed, not only without their conſent, but directly contrary to their expreſs will? Yet this muſt be the ſtate of the <hi>Americans,</hi> if taxed by the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Parliament, when they chuſe repreſentatives for that purpoſe. The very idea of it is abſurd, is monſtrous, big with iniquity, ſtupidity, and evil; nor is it wonderful, that more than an hundred years ſhould have paſſed away, before the man was born who could deviſe ſo vile a complication of tyranny and folly.</p>
               <p>THE attempt of any Miniſter, to take from us the right of giving our money by our own conſent, (of which, from long experience we know the value, and how eſſential it is to our freedom) to annihilate our own repreſentative, and conſtitute an unlimited authority over us, deſerves ſurely no better treatment, than that of being branded as tyrannous and fooliſh.

               <p>THERE are ſome who think, they fully juſtify this oppreſſion on the <hi>Americans,</hi> by ſaying, there are great numbers of people in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> who never vote for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, yet are taxed by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament. This, as ſophiſtry often does, ſeems to carry weight with it; but it is a mere <hi>petitio principio,</hi> a begging the queſtion. We are not <hi>contending that our rabble, or all unqualified perſons,</hi> ſhall have the right of voting, or not be taxed; but that the <hi>freeholders, and electors,</hi> whoſe right accrues to them from the common law, or from charter, ſhall not be deprived of that right; and, let any man ſhew me one inſtance in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> where a man, ſo qualified, does not vote for a repreſentative? Is it not then moſt pitiful, moſt deteſtable ſophiſtry, to tell us, that becauſe there are a number of people in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> who are, by the conſtitution, <hi>unqualified</hi> to vote for a repreſentative, and yet are taxed, therefore all the people in <hi>America,</hi> who are <hi>qualified,</hi> ſhall be treated in the ſame manner? This is truly <hi>Grenvillian</hi> reaſoning, a confuſion of abſurdity and injuſtice, too flagrant to be extenuated, too groſs to admit of exaggeration. When ſuch arguments are uſed, to juſtify the uſurpation of our liberties, it is ſurely time for the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be alarmed, leſt, when tyranny, which, from its nature, knows no bounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unſatiated with deſpotic rule in <hi>America,</hi> the ſame argument ſhould be turned upon them, and an arbitrary Miniſter ſhould ſay, that, <hi>as one third of the people of</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>have been long taxed, without their conſent, it can be no injury or injuſtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the reſt to the ſame condition.</hi> And, certainly, the having enſlaved <hi>America,</hi> under the ſhadow of ſuch reaſoning, will be no feeble precedents for trying its efficacy in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> It is true, nothing but <hi>force</hi> will ever accommodate it to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions <hi>here;</hi> and a <hi>ſtanding army,</hi> artfully increaſed, or maintained in <hi>America,</hi> may one day give it the ſame weight <hi>there.</hi> Certain it is, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> grandeur and conſtitution, ſtands or falls with us; we are her natural and neceſſary ſupport, and when we fall, it muſt be like the ſtrong man, embracing the pillars of her conſtitution, and its ruins will follow us.</p>
               <p>SOME of my countrymen ſeem to think, that as we are weak, we ſhould be ſilent; and endeavour, by manufacturing for ourſelves, to convince <hi>Great-Britain</hi> of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to her proſperity; and therefore induce her to treat us with more tenderneſs, juſtice and reſpect.</p>
               <p>BUT they muſt pardon me, for differing with them; for, though I am well ſatisfied that we might ſupply ourſelves with manufactures, and thereby give a very ſenſible
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011239_0047_0F867973F87C4420"/>
wound to the trade of <hi>Britain,</hi> yet this is but an inadequate method of vindicating our rights. Our view ſhould be to <hi>re-eſtabliſh our conſtitution;</hi> not to injure or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the people of <hi>Britain:</hi> And when I have adviſed the forming aſſociations for the encouragement of manufactures, it was chiefly with this intention, that if the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable ſeverity of <hi>Britain</hi> ſhould refuſe us redreſs, we might not be abſolutely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon her for the neceſſaries of life. The bond of union between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> is <hi>ſupport</hi> from us, <hi>protection</hi> from her; ſhould we no longer continue to ſupply her with raw materials, and conſume her manufactures, that union would be diſſolved. I therefore cannot think this method altogether eligible, neither do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it adequate. For, to what purpoſe ſhall we ſave money, which others may take away at pleaſure?</p>
               <p>THE Farmer has already, in his very uſeful letters, developed, with great ſagacity, the deſigns and tendency of the late act concerning <hi>America;</hi> and he has, with equal perſpicuity, and political learning, warned us of their conſequences, and exhorted us againſt permitting encroachments; which, however ſmall at firſt, will ſoon be drawn into precedents for the moſt dangerous and oppreſſive invaſions of Liberty. Suffer me to add my feeble voice to his, and exhort you to ſuppreſs the diſeaſe in its infancy; leſt it arrive to a degree of violence, dangerous in its effects, and uncertain in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p>IT is eaſy to ſhew, that the right aſſumed by any one of the three acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, already ſpecified, if given up, would be ſufficient to enſlave us. As the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of money and places, generally procures to the Miniſter a majority in Parliament, in the conduct even of <hi>Britiſh</hi> affairs, it will certainly be ſecure in thoſe of <hi>America:</hi> This right may therefore be conſidered, as <hi>in the Crown and its Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us ſuppoſe, then, that the Miniſter poſſeſſed the right alone of forming <hi>a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue by duties,</hi> upon goods imported from <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> what would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? Either that we muſt ceaſe to take any goods whatever from <hi>Britain,</hi> and therefore diſſolve the union between us; or, the Miniſter would have it in his power to raiſe money upon us at pleaſure. Our Aſſemblies would then be of no uſe, we ſhould have no reſtraint upon the Crown, no method of ingratiating ourſelves with our Sovereign, by granting him aids; the Crown would have obtained a perpetual revenue from us, which the Commons of <hi>Britain</hi> know would be ſo injurious to their liberties, that they have ever guarded againſt it with unremitting vigilance. Under the influence of ſuch a right, we ſhould experience the fate of the <hi>Roman</hi> people, in the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable times of their ſlavery, and be ſleeced by every exaction which the ingenuity of tax-gatherers could deviſe<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>MR. LOCKE, one of the cleareſt reaſoners the world has yet ſeen, and who ſeems firſt to have taught men preciſion in thinking, has, in the words above, laid down, clearly and explicitly, the principle of freedom in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution; <hi>taxation</hi> by <hi>repreſentation only.</hi> This eſſential right, inherent, unalienably inherent, in the people, or their repreſentative, is wreſted from us by the late acts, and, to ſhew how abſolute the ſlavery is, to which we muſt ſubmit, the <hi>tax</hi> is <hi>perpetual,</hi> and the produce of it is to be remitted home, there to be diſpoſed of by the <hi>Crown, without any controul from the people, by whom it is paid, or by their repreſentative.</hi>

its <hi>Miniſter;</hi> what further aggravation can be added? What injury, what indignity, more? The meaſure of ſlavery (as far as money is concerned) is now full; and there wants the humble acquieſcence only of theſe colonies, to pour its bitterneſs upon us, without mercy, and without end.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>right of the repreſentative of the people,</hi> to <hi>enquire</hi> into the manner in which the <hi>taxes raiſed by them on their conſtituents have been diſpoſed of by the executive part of government,</hi> that is, by the Crown, or its Miniſter, is alſo eſſential to liberty and good government. Without this right, taxes would more frequently ſerve to make Miniſters wicked, and enable them to vitiate and corrupt the government, than they would anſwer the purpoſes for which they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I SHALL now lay before my countrymen, thoſe parts of the act, <hi>for laying duties on the goods we conſume,</hi> which demonſtrate the plenitude of that power aſſerted over us.</p>
               <p>WE, your Majeſty's moſt dutiful ſubjects, <hi>the Commons of Great-Britain,</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to <hi>give and grant</hi> unto your Majeſty, the ſeveral rates and duties herein after mentioned; and do moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty, that it may be enacted, and be it enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that from and after the twentieth day of <hi>November,</hi> 1767, there ſhall be raiſed, levied, collected, and paid, unto his Majeſty, <hi>his heirs and ſucceſſors,</hi> for, and upon the reſpective goods herein after mentioned, which ſhall be imported from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> into any colony or plantation in <hi>America,</hi> which now is, or hereafter may be, under the dominion of his Majeſty, his heirs, or ſucceſſors, the ſeveral rates and duties following, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> And be it further enacted by the authority aforeſaid, that his <hi>Majeſty, and his ſucceſſors,</hi> ſhall be, and are hereby empowered, from time to time, by any warrant, or warrants, under his, or their royal ſign manual, or ſign manuals, counterſigned by the high treaſurer, or any three or more of the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of the treaſury, for the time being, to cauſe ſuch monies to be applied, out of the produce of the duties granted by this act, as his Majeſty, or his ſucceſſors, ſhall think proper or neceſſary, for the defraying the charges of the adminiſtration of juſtice, and the ſupport of the civil government, within all, <hi>or any</hi> of the ſaid colonies or plantations.</p>
               <p>THE injuries and oppreſſions with which this act alone is fraught, are manifeſt from a bare recital of theſe parts. Has not the adminiſtration of government been always ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently provided for by the colonies themſelves, in a conſtitutional manner: Where then was the propriety of <hi>invading our rights, and innovating upon the conſtitution</hi> for this purpoſe? Have we given any late inſtances of ſuch folly or ſtupidity, that it might be juſtly concluded, we could not diſcern the exigencies of government; or, diſcerning, would not have capacity or inclination to anſwer them? I think, I may ſafely defy the framers and abettors of theſe acts, to prove this upon us. Why then are we deprived of that check, which we had upon government, ariſing from that right? Surely, for no other reaſon, but becauſe <hi>we are no longer to be free.</hi>

THE advocates for this act, (who happily are indeed but very few) ſupport it upon this principle, that the Parliament has a right to lay duties upon her own manufactures. The ſubterfuges of ſophiſtry and injuſtice, are as endleſs as they are futile. Let theſe Gentlemen ſhew me where an import duty on <hi>Britiſh</hi> commodities was ever laid by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament on any other people, but the <hi>Americans.</hi> Yet unleſs they can do this, the inſtance is inapplicable. But what would the <hi>Spaniards</hi> think, were the Parliament of <hi>Britain</hi> to lay certain import duties on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> cloth imported into <hi>Spain;</hi> and for the purpoſe of a revenue to ſupport the civil government of <hi>Spain?</hi> Gentlemen chuſe to forgèt the purpoſes of this act, when they undertake to juſtify it; but they will preſently hear of further purpoſes in it. ſtill more abhorrent from our rights. In the mean time, I think, a wiſe friend to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> would not be forward in eſtabliſhing this practice of a native's laying what duties ſhe pleaſed even on her own exports; ſince, under the ſhadow of this right, the <hi>Swede</hi> and the <hi>Dane</hi> might raiſe intolerable exactions on <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for their hemp and iron; to which ſhe muſt either ſubmit, or the <hi>Britiſh</hi> fleet would be rendered uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs<note n="*" place="bottom">They have already attempted to render the articles we muſt have from them, more expenſive to us, by leſs adequate means, than that of laying what duties they pleaſe on their exports.</note>.</p>
               <p>THIS act is alſo defended upon <hi>precedent;</hi> a duty, it is ſaid, has been laid on <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deira</hi> wine, and we have ſubmitted to it.

Look back into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hiſtory, and you will find that every right of freedom that people poſſeſſes, has been occaſionally violated; and ſhall it be therefore pleaded, on precedent, that they have no rights? This would indeed be the plea of M—ſ—d and G—v—le, to ſanctify the deſpotiſm they are executing over <hi>America;</hi> and meditating over <hi>Britain.</hi> It has already been embraced by the artful Mr. <hi>Hume,</hi> in vindicating the tyranny of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> from the opprobrium it deſerved. He, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reigns of the <hi>Tudors</hi> furniſhed many precedents fer arbitrary power, cautions us, in the moſt friendly manner, againſt the uſeleſs curioſity of looking any further back into our hiſtory, ſince it is covered with darkneſs, and involved in perplexity; ſo our precedent friends, will diſſuade us from looking farther back than the ſhort period, ſince a duty was laid on <hi>Madeira</hi> wine, or the right of taxing the colonies declared. But the learning and patriotiſm of Dr. <hi>Hurd</hi> have amply vindicated the liberties of <hi>Britain,</hi> againſt the fineſſe of Mr. <hi>Hume;</hi> and, I hope, the FARMER's LETTERS will for ever guard us againſt the baleful arts of theſe ſiniſter friends.

moſt upright judge, and illuſtrious defender of <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>American</hi> liberties, my Lord <hi>Camden,</hi> in his letter on general warrants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> "But even, if the uſage had been both immemorial and uniform, and ten thouſand ſimilar warrants could have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, it would not have been ſufficient, becauſe, the practice muſt likewiſe be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the principles of law, in order to be good; whereas, this is a practice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with, and in direct oppoſition to the firſt and cleareſt principles of law. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial uniform uſage will not even ſupport the bye-law of a corporation, if it be flatly repugnant to the fundamentals of the common law; much leſs will it authorize the ſecret practice of a political office."</p>
               <p>THE preamble of this act, for laying duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> declares it expedient alſo, that a revenue ſhould be thus raiſed on us, "towards defraying the expences of defending, protecting, and ſecuring theſe dominions."</p>
               <p>NOW, I ſhould be glad to know, in what we are to be defended, protected and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; not in our liberty and property, without queſtion, for this act takes them both away from us, and when we are deprived of the poſſeſſions we thought our own, of the freedom we imagined was our right, what will then remain a worthy object of invaſion from others, or protection to us? But, to be more particular on this ſubject of protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe colonies have two enemies, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> are their political enemies, in conſequence of their <hi>connection</hi> with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and the ſupport they furniſh to <hi>Britain,</hi> enabling her to rival <hi>France,</hi> and baffle the ambitious views of that monarchy. What are we juſtly to expect from <hi>Britain</hi> for this ſupport? PROTECTION from the <hi>French;</hi> and thus it is, as I have before obſerved, that the bonds of union between <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and her colonies, are, ſupport from us, protection from her. There are ſome people who cannot ſee how we ſupport <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> yet nothing is more obvious, nothing more eaſily comprehended. It is but to reflect a moment on the number of ſhips and ſeamen the trade to the colonies ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, the manufacturers they maintain, and the taxes they pay in the conſumption of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> manufactures. The Tobacco trade, alone, may be computed to maintain upwards of 4000 ſeamen<note n="*" place="bottom">If I miſtake not, it is computed in a very ſenſible pamphlet, written in <hi>America,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the agitation of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> that the tobacco trade employed of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſeamen, 4500, the ſugar trade, 3600, the <hi>Newfoundland</hi> fiſhery, 4000. In this view alone, <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> would be a very important nurſery for <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſeamen, and we well know her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity depends on them.</note>, and 250 sail of ſhips annually; and the very great value of the whole plantation trade, may be eaſily judged from the veneration which is paid in <hi>Britain</hi> to the act of navigation which ſecures that trade to her. It is ſpeaking greatly within bounds, to ſay, there are 100, 000 manufacturers in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> who draw their daily ſubſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from <hi>America;</hi> and, I am much miſtaken, if the colonies do not <hi>actually</hi> pay, half a million, at leaſt, of the taxes in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> The manner in which they pay it, is plain; the ſhoes I now have on, were made in <hi>England;</hi> the grazier, or butcher, who ſold the raw hide, paid the land tax, and was reimburſed by the tanner, with intereſt; in like manner, the tanner was repaid by the ſhoemaker, for that, and

               <p>PROTECTION from the attacks of our <hi>European</hi> enemies, is juſtly due to us on the part of <hi>Britain;</hi> and, from the <hi>Indians,</hi> I humbly apprehend, we can defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is not probable, the whole force which the <hi>Indians</hi> could poſſibly bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, would amount (were all the nations we know, combined, which is hardly poſſible) to 30, 000 ſighting men; our Militia, on the continent, amounts to more than 100, 000. We effectually maintained 25, 000 troops, during the laſt war: Is it then to be preſumed we are not able to defend ourſelves againſt the <hi>Indians?</hi> Is it preſume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able we ſhall not always be able to defend ourſelves againſt them, when it is certain they decreaſe, and, on the contrary, we increaſe, ſo as to double our number in 25 years, This act would indeed render ſuch protection neceſſary, becauſe it would make us ſlaves; and the ſtate of ſlavery, is that of weakneſs. To ſuppoſe we want protection from the <hi>Indians,</hi> is to imagine we have greatly indeed degenerated from the ſpirit of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; who, when not a tenth of our number, not only defended themſelves from them, but drove them as far back as they pleaſed. Have we not, with eaſe, defended ourſelves againſt them for upwards of 100 years, and what inſtance has this period fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of ſuch national degeneracy, that we may be ſuppoſed incapable of continuing this defence? The ſuppoſition of ſuch incapacity, is an inſult that hardly has an equal, except i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I HAVE marked a ſingle word in the preamble of this act, which points out a very alarming purpoſe of this tax, in its being raiſed for the uſe of all, or any of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. It is but too plain, that we are taxed in this <hi>unconſtitutional</hi> manner, of ſupport the unfertile dominion of <hi>Florida,</hi> and the conquered province of <hi>Canada.</hi> By the cuſtom-houſe accounts in the year 1766, <hi>Canada</hi> produced 22, 000 pounds yearly: <hi>Florida</hi> nothing. They are maintained at half a million annual expence to <hi>Britain:</hi> They were conquered and ſecured by our united endeavours, with thoſe of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> troops, in which we furniſhed a large quota of troops, and ſuffered heavy taxes. They never can be of any advantage to us, but may be eventually injurious, by rendering our produce leſs valuable. Yet, we are to pay for their ſupport and protection: We are to maintain a ſmall army of <hi>Britiſh</hi> troops in them, not only for their ſecurity, but to <hi>enforce,</hi> occaſionally, <hi>upon ourſelves,</hi> any oppreſſive meaſures, which an arbitrary or ignorant Miniſter, ſhall wickedly deviſe, and obſtinately purſue.

               <p>LET me now take leave to propoſe the following form of aſſociation for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of <hi>American</hi> manufactures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We the underwritten to agree, and ſolemnly promiſe to prefer on every occaſion, the manufactures of</hi> America, <hi>to thoſe of every other country; and to promote with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our abilities,</hi> American <hi>manufactures, ſo far as to furniſh ourſelves with the neceſſaries of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE beneficial influence of aſſociations, and inſtitutions of the ſame kind, on the progreſs of manufactures, has been too often experienced to be now queſtioned. The linen hall at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and wiſe regulations attentively purſued, have brought the linen
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:011239_0051_0F8678DECD1C7200"/>
manufacture in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſtate as flouriſhing as it is beneficial. The board for the improvement of fiſheries and manufactures in <hi>Scotland,</hi> conſtituted in the year 1727, aided by a national ſpirit, in which we are rather too deficient, have brought the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of linen there, in a few years, to great perfection. "They" ſays an approved writer<note n="*" place="bottom">FRANCIS HOME, M. D.</note> on bleaching, "have with unwearied and diſintereſted zeal, contributed in a very great meaſure to raiſe and direct a ſpirit of induſtry among us, by their own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by their experience, by adopting the experience of our neighbours, and by diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting with great prudence, thoſe ſmall funds, intruſted by the government, for their management."</p>
               <p>HAVE not we, in this colony, a committee for the ſame purpoſe? What pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents their imitating this laudable example? The ſupplying ourſelves with linen, would be highly advantageous to us, without interfering with the manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> nay, we might make it a part of our export, in return for thoſe commodities we may receive from her. This would ſave her a large balance, paid to foreigners, for their linen. If my memory does not fail me, a computation I received from one of the commiſſioners of the linen company in <hi>Scotland,</hi> made <hi>Britain</hi> debtor for much more than half of what ſhe conſumed, and Mr. <hi>Gee,</hi> makes the balance of trade with <hi>Germany, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> for this article, to amount to near one mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion annually againſt <hi>Britain.</hi> We have therefore an ample field before us, to animate and reward our induſtry, in purſuing this ſingle branch of manufactures.</p>
               <p>THERE are many people, who ſeem to think the attempt of manufacturing, even neceſſaries for ourſelves, too arduous to be ſucceſsful. But certainly, they whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements are great, will overcome difficulties, which to the unanimated, appear inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable. And can there be greater incitements, than the vindicating our liberties, and maintaining a juſt independence of grinding extortion, and arbitrary impoſitions? Were we once determined upon the attempt, all difficulties would vaniſh; for what is there too laborious to be accompliſhed by the foſtering care and wiſdom of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, by a judicious diſtribution of public and private bounties, by giving attention and encouragement to every uſeful project, by wiſdom in planning, by induſtry, unanimity, and ſpirit in execution? The example of the Gentlemen will inſtruct and encourage the poor; and aſſociations for the uſe of <hi>American</hi> manufactures, will hold up to them a ſure reward for their induſtry and labour. Theſe colonies, like all young countries, abound in children; every individual of which may, from the time they are able to move their hands or feet, be employed in manufactures of various kinds. One may ſee in the manufactories of <hi>England,</hi> the young, the decrepid, and the old people per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming taſks proportioned to their abilities, with great utility. In the Foundling Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, every female child is ſeen knitting, ſewing, or ſpinning; every male at the loom, or ſome other uſeful occupation. In this colony, we have numbers of Negro children, and ſuperannuated field Negroes, who are rather an expence than profit; though they are perfectly fit for manufactures, and might be engaged in them much to the advantage of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:011239_0052_0F8678DF7B663128"/>
their maſters. There are ſome worthily induſtrious Gentlemen among us, who, the laſt year, cloathed entirely upwards of an hundred of their people with the labour chiefly of theſe, otherwiſe uſeleſs hands. It is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

With this view every expreſſion of diſcontent under his ruinous and oppreſſive adminiſtration was imputed to a deſire in thoſe colonies to diſſolve all connection with <hi>Britain;</hi> every tumult here, was inflamed into rebellion.</p>
               <p>LET it be our ſtudy, my countrymen, to invalidate theſe pernicious endeavours, as far as is conſiſtent with the maintenance of our juſt rights. Let our oppoſition, while it is <hi>animated</hi> by a full ſenſe of our privileges as freemen, be <hi>moderated</hi> by that reſpect and tenderneſs which are due to friends and brothers. <hi>Soft words turn away wrath,</hi> and if the people in <hi>Britain</hi> have been deceived and incenſed, by the guileful practices and inflammatory arts of thoſe who are equally enemies to both, let us fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate their miſchievous intentions, by gently recalling the people to their reaſon, by treating them as if <hi>they had haſtily ſhot their arrows o'er the houſe, and hurt their brothers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT muſt not be judged from what I have ſaid, that we ſhould reſign one atom of our rights, or ever deſiſt, from aſſerting and ſupporting them; but the direful neceſſity
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:011239_0052_0F8678DF7B663128"/>
of doing this, by other inſtruments than reaſon, is not yet come; when it do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only muſt decide the controverſy. We are engaged in a conteſt the moſt dignified and important of any that can claim the attention or the lives of men; a conteſt for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: Let us preſerve its dignity unfullied by ourſelves, unimpaired by others. The more we reflect on the cauſe we are vindicating, the more fully ſhall we be convinced of its juſtneſs, the more immutably ſhall we be determined in its ſupport. For my own part, every hour I conſider the late attempts upon our liberties, makes them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more monſtrous, more replete with oppreſſion, more abſolutely productive of a tremendous deſpotiſm.</p>
               <p>IT may well be ſuppoſed, that Mr. <hi>Grenville,</hi> and his abettors, are conſcious of the badneſs of their cauſe, how little it will bear the teſt of reaſon, when they endeavour to ſupport it by inflammatory exaggerations, by infuſing ſuſpicions, jealouſies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices into mens minds; and executing that by <hi>paſſion,</hi> which they deſpair of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing by <hi>reaſon.</hi> A meaſure, ſo ſupported, wears a very ſuſpicious aſpect; nor is its gloom much diſpelled, by the act declarative of a right to tax theſe colonies, in whatever manner they pleaſe. When a meaſure was adopted, of taxing us without out conſent, and we deeming it invaſive of our privileges, as freemen, and violative of the conſtitution, denied the right by which it was done; the paſſing an act declarative of that right, was confeſſing, either that it did not exiſt before, or was very dubious, Reſolutions are both the proper and ſufficient means of declaring a right, that is real and original. The bringing in a bill, and paſſing an act, <hi>looked like eſtabliſhing ſome new and aſſumed power;</hi> not declaring an original right. "Beſides, an act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſays my Lord <hi>Camden,</hi> newly made, is not ſo venerable in the eyes of the world. or ſo ſecure againſt future alterations, as the old common law of the land, which has been, from time immemorial, the inheritance of every <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and is, on account of its antiquity, held, as it were, ſacred in every man's mind.<note n="*" place="bottom">On general warrants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

is what we can neither give up, nor they take from us;</hi> and therefore, even an act of Parliament, is limited, in this reſpect, like the imperious waves of the ocean, hither it may come, but no further. It cannot touch, or ſubvert that conſitution, in which its own exiſtence is founded. GOD has made us, ſays my Lord <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> to deſire <hi>happineſs,</hi> he has made that happineſs dependent on <hi>ſociety,</hi> and the happineſs of ſociety, on good or bad government; his intention therefore was, that government ſhould be good." I would ſay farther, that the happineſs of ſociety depends upon <hi>free government,</hi> for this is the only form which conſults and provides for the good, ſecurity, and happineſs of many; in oppoſition to the will and pleaſure of one, or of a few<note n="*" place="bottom">It is under the <hi>government of laws</hi> only, <hi>not of men,</hi> that happineſs and virtue are to be found; that is, where the laws, which regulate our conduct in ſociety, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, and they, who are to execute them, cannot pervert or tranſgreſs them with impunity. "Arbitrary power," ſays the ingenious <hi>Hume,</hi> "in all caſes, is ſomewhat oppreſſive and devouring; but it is altogether ruinous and intolerable, when contracted into a ſmall compaſs; and becomes ſtill worſe, when the perſon who poſſeſſes it, knows that the time of his authority is limited and uncertain. <hi>Habet ſubjectos, tanquam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os; viles ut alienos.</hi> He governs the ſubjects with full authority, as if they were his own; and with negligence or tyranny, as belonging to another. A people, governed after ſuch a manner, are ſlaves in the full and proper ſenſe of the word; and 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they can ever aſpire to any refinements in taſte or reaſon. They dare not ſo much as pretend to enjoy the neceſſaries of life in plenty, or ſecurity." Now, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will reflect a moment, muſt perceive the fate of theſe colonies delineated above, ſhould the right lately aſſumed over us, by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, be once eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Miniſter, for the time being, would have an abſolute power, with reſpect to us, it would be contracted into a ſmall compaſs, exerted, comparatively over a few, and would be therefore ruinous and intolerable.</note>. It is moſt certain, that men cannot be happy or virtuous in that ſociety, where the will of one is the law; where liberty, life, and property, are in the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of one, or a few perſons; in ſo precarious, ſo perilous a ſituation, happineſs and virtue can rarely, if at all, be found. Inſenſibility of the ills, to which they are expoſed, the wretched boon of long and painful ſuffering, ſometimes aſſumes, even in ſlavery, the ſpecious form of happineſs; but, how poor is this, when compared with that inexpreſſibly happy feeling, which conſcious dignity and worth inſpire.</p>

               <p>IN the great and important queſtion now before us, my countrymen, a queſtion on which the liberty or bondage, the weal or woe, of millions <hi>now,</hi> and tens of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions <hi>hereafter,</hi> will depend, it is incumbent on us, to ſtudy the moſt perfect unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſentiment and action. Like a band of brothers, theſe colonies ſhould be indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luby firm, in defending the ſacred fire of freedom from being extinguiſhed. Our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted efforts will be weighty, and, in all probability, ſuccesſful; if divided, we ſhall counteract one another, and all our endeavours, to vindicate the conſtitution from ruin, and ourſelves from bondage, will be feeble and ineffectual. It is one common intereſt, that claims our union; the rights of every colony reſt upon the ſame foundation, and cannot be ſubverted in one, without being overthrown in all.</p>
               <p>OUR friends too, in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> would be increaſed and encouraged by our una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity in oppoſition; diviſions among ourſelves, would ſilence and diſhearten them. It is not to be hoped, that we ſhall find men in <hi>Britain</hi> faithful to our intereſts, if we ourſelves abandon them, or determined in their oppoſition to meaſures, injurious to us, while we appear dubious or divided. It is unqueſtionably the wiſh and aim of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in, <hi>Britain,</hi> to enfeeble the intereſt of <hi>America</hi> there, to create in us a diſtruſt of our friends on the other ſide of the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> to excite an univerſal jealouſy of us in

them, and to ſpread diſſention and diſmay among ourſelves, by partial exertions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and arbitrary rule. Theſe are the means, by which they hope the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to diſturb, ſubdue, and enſlave us; theſe are the views, with which they have changed the oppreſſive Stamp-Act, into a not leſs oppreſſive, though more ſpeciouſly juſt, duty, on certain <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures imported into <hi>America,</hi> have purſued the ſame arbitrary plan, under what we called and deemed an <hi>American</hi> adminiſtration, and have endeavoured to enforce abſolute obedience to the billetting-act, by the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the Legiſlature in one province.</p>
               <p>THE colonies of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> have, by their reſpective repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, given their ſenſe of the ruinous tendency and arbitrary nature of theſe meaſures. In <hi>Virginia,</hi> they have ſent petitions, memorials and remonſtrances, to the different branches of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, againſt all theſe acts, not excepting that for ſuſpending the legiſlative power of <hi>New-York,</hi> which they juſtly deem equally deſtructive to their own liberties, as to thoſe of that particular province. While I rejoice in this tranſaction, I promiſe myſelf, that the influence of ſo noble and uſeful an example will be univerſal, that every colony will, in like manner, bear its teſtimony againſt theſe acts, and the principle upon which they are founded.</p>
               <p>NEXT to the importance of unanimity among the colonies, in expreſſing their abhorrence of the arbitrary meaſures lately adopted againſt <hi>American</hi> freedom, ſtands that of the concurrence of the two branches of the Legiſlature, in each colony, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly and Council, in remonſtrating againſt them, and petitioning for redreſs. Such a concurrence muſt give the greateſt weight and efficacy to our public proceedings, muſt place, in the ſtrongeſt light, the dignity and value of our rights, when no conſideration of place or profit can influence men to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it in ſilence, and ſee them violated. This co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, I mention it with the higheſt ſatisfaction, has purſued ſuch a plan, the Upper Houſe of Aſſembly having concurred with the Lower, in all the proceedings againſt the late acts of Parliament. Such unanimity in conduct, it is to be hoped, will be as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally imitated, as it muſt be generally approved; ſince it cannot but redound to the immortal honour of thoſe gentlemen, who thus ſacrifice every private conſideration to the public good, and the maintainance of our invaluable rights.</p>
               <p>As the ſanction of the Legiſlature gives dignity and weight to the ſentiments of the people; ſo it muſt receive from them ſupport and ſtrength. It is therefore the duty of every individual to ſecond, with his utmoſt abilities, the endeavours of the legiſlative powers in vindication of <hi>American</hi> liberty. It is now that we are called upon by every ſacred and valuable tie, by our own rights, by the rights of our children, and their poſterity, by the veneration due to our free conſtution, by the virtue, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory, that ſpring from its admirable frame; to fruſtrate and repel every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of thoſe, who would violate and corrupt it. It is at this juncture that fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and induſtry will have double the beneficial influence which uſually flows from them, that harmony and ſpirit in thinking, ſpeaking and acting, againſt uſurpation or oppreſſion, will reſtore and reanimate our liberties, ſo as to preſerve the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I HAVE thus adventured to lay before the public, in a ſeries of papers, my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the preſent ſtate of affairs; to ſhew the nature and excellence of liberty, the vices, the miſeries and abaſement which ſlavery produces, to develope the artful deſigns of our enemies; the arbitrary tendency of their late conduct in <hi>Britain,</hi> the fatal conſequences' that muſt inevitably follow our acquieſcence under the rights lately aſſumed and exerciſed over us, by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament; and the neceſſity of an unanimous and determined oppoſition to the meditated ſubve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT will be for ever pleaſing to me, if I have thrown any light on this very important ſubject, if I have aided the underſtanding of any one man, or infuſed into his mind the true and noble ſpirit of liberty, determining him to ſupport it with his lateſt breath.</p>
