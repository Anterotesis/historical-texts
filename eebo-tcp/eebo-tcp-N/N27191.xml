         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE original plan of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the late Dr. Robertſon, with reſpect to the Hiſtory of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, comprehended not only an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the diſcovery of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and of the conqueſts and colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Spaniards, but embraced alſo the hiſtory of the Britiſh and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:036237_0003_10088F080046B1A8"/>
Portugueſe eſtabliſhments in the New World, and of the ſettlements made by the ſeveral nations of Europe in the Weſt India Iſlands. It was his intention not to have publiſhed any part of the Work until the whole was completed. In the Preface to his Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of America, he has ſtated the reaſons which induced him to depart from that reſolution, and to publiſh the Two Volumes which contain an account of the diſcovery of the New World, and of the progreſs of the Spaniſh arms and colonies in that quarter of the globe. He ſays, "he had made ſome progreſs in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Britiſh America;" and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces his intention to return to that part of his Work, as ſoon as the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which at that time prevailed in the Britiſh Colonies in America, ſhould ſubſide, and regular government be re-eſtabliſhed. Various cauſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:036237_0004_10088F0ADA4E11E0"/>
in preventing him from fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his intention.</p>
            <p>During the courſe of a tedious ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which he early foreſaw would have a fatal termination, Dr. Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at different times deſtroyed many of his papers. But after his death, I found that part of the Hiſtory of Britiſh America which he had wrote many years before, and which is now offered to the Public. It is written with his own hand, as all his Works were; it is as carefully corrected as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of his Manuſcripts which I have ever ſeen; and he had thought it worthy of being preſerved, as it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the flames to which ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther papers had been committed. I read it with the utmoſt attention; but before I came to any reſolution about the publication, I put the MS. into the hands of ſome of thoſe friends whom my Father uſed to conſult on
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:036237_0005_10088F0C6296DBC0"/>
ſuch occaſions, as it would have been raſhneſs and preſumption in me to have truſted to my own partial deciſion. It was peruſed by ſome other perſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in whoſe taſte and judgment I have the greateſt confidence; by all of them I was encouraged to offer it to the public, as a fragment curious and intereſting in itſelf, and not inferior to any of my Father's Works.</p>
            <p>When I determined to follow that advice, it was a circumſtance of great weight with me, that as I never could think myſelf at liberty to deſtroy thoſe papers which my Father had thought worthy of being preſerved, and as I could not know into whoſe hands they might hereafter fall, I conſidered it as certain that they would be publiſhed at ſome future period, when they might meet with an Editor, who, not being actuated by the ſame ſacred regard for the reputation of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:036237_0006_10088F10AE541F68"/>
which I feel, might make altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and additions, and obtrude the whole on the Public as a genuine and authentic work. The MS. is now publiſhed, ſuch as it was left by the Author; nor have I preſumed to make any addition, alteration, or correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatever.</p>

            <p>THE dominions of Great-Britain in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica are next in extent to thoſe of Spain. Its acquiſitions there are a recompence due to thoſe enterpriſing talents which prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Engliſh to enter early on the career of diſcovery, and to purſue it with perſevering ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. England was the ſecond nation that ventured to viſit the New World. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Columbus's ſucceſsful voyage filled all Europe with aſtoniſhment and admiration. But in England it did ſomething more; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a vehement deſire of emulating the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Spain, and of aiming to obtain ſome ſhare in thoſe advantages which were expected in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036237_0015_10088F2AFB38B4A0"/>
this new field opened to national activity. The attention of the Engliſh court had been turned towards the diſcovery of unknown countries, by its negociation with Barthole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Columbus. Henry VII. having liſtened to his propoſitions with a more favourable ear than could have been expected from a cautious, diſtruſtful prince, averſe by habit as well as by temper to new and hazardous projects, he was more eaſily induced to approve of a voyage for diſcovery, propoſed by ſome of his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſoon after the return of Chriſtopher Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus.</p>
            <p>But though the Engliſh had ſpirit to form this ſcheme, they had not, at that period, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſuch ſkill in navigation as qualified them for carrying it into execution. From the inconſiderate ambition of its monarchs, the nation had long waſted its genius and activity in pernicious and ineffectual efforts to conquer France. When this ill directed ardour began to abate, the fatal conteſt between the houſes of York and Lancaſter, turned the arms of one half of the kingdom againſt the other, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the vigour of both. During the courſe of two centuries, while induſtry and commerce were making gradual progreſs, both in the ſouth and north of Europe, the Engliſh conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo blind to the advantages of their own ſituation, that they hardly began to bend their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036237_0016_10088F2C84C93840"/>
thoughts towards thoſe objects and purſuits, to which they are indebted for their preſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulence and power. While the trading veſſels of Italy, Spain, and Portugal, as well as thoſe of the Hans Towns, viſited the moſt remote ports in Europe, and carried on an active inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with its various nations, the Engliſh did little more than creep along their own coaſts, in ſmall barks, which conveyed the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of one country to another. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was almoſt wholly paſſive. Their wants were ſupplied by ſtrangers; and whatever ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or luxury of life their own country did not yield, was imported in foreign bottoms. The Croſs of St. George was ſeldom diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the precincts of the narrow ſeas. Hardly any Engliſh ſhip traded with Spain or Portugal, before the beginning of the fifteenth century; and half a century more elapſed before the Engliſh mariners became ſo adventurous as to enter the Mediterranean.</p>
            <p>In this infancy of navigation, Henry could not commit the conduct of an armament, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to explore unknown regions, to his own ſubjects. He inveſted Giovanni Gaboto, a Venetian adventurer, who had ſettled in Briſtol, with the chief command; and iſſued a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to him and his three ſons, empowering them to ſail, under the banner of England, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eaſt, north, or weſt, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036237_0017_10088F2E1F835260"/>
countries unoccupied by any Chriſtian ſtate; to take poſſeſſion of them in his name, and to carry on an excluſive trade with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, under condition of paying a fifth part of the free profit on every voyage to the crown. This commiſſion was granted on March 5th, 1495, in leſs than two years after the return of Columbus from America<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 4.</note>. But Cabot (for that is the name he aſſumed in England, and by which he is beſt known) did not ſet out on his voyage for two years. He, together with his ſecond ſon Sebaſtian, embarked at Briſtol, (May 1497) on board a ſhip furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the king, and was accompanied by four ſmall barks, fitted out by merchants of that city.</p>
            <p>As in that age the moſt eminent navigators, formed by the inſtructions of Columbus, or animated by his example, were guided by ideas derived from his ſuperior knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, Cabot had adopted the ſyſtem of that great man, concerning the probability of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new and ſhorter paſſage to the Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by holding a weſtern courſe. The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which Columbus had formed, with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the iſlands which he had diſcovered, was univerſally received. They were ſuppoſed to lie contiguous to the great continent of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036237_0018_10088F2FA6FCE948"/>
and to conſtitute a part of the vaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries comprehended under that general name. Cabot, accordingly, deemed it probable, that by ſteering to the north-weſt, he might reach India by a ſhorter courſe than that which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus had taken, and hoped to fall in with the coaſt of Cathay, or China, of whoſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility and opulence the deſcriptions of Marco Polo had excited high ideas. After ſailing for ſome weeks due weſt, and nearly on the parallel of the port from which he took his departure, he diſcovered a large iſland, which he called <hi>Prima Viſta,</hi> and his ſailors, <hi>Newfoundland;</hi> and in a few days he deſcried a ſmaller iſle, to which he gave the name of St. John. (June 24.) He landed on both theſe, made ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on their ſoil and productions, and brought off three of the natives. Continuing his courſe weſtward, he ſoon reached the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of North America, and ſailed along it from the fifty-ſixth to the thirty-eighth degree of latitude, from the coaſt of Labrador to that of Virginia. As his chief object was to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome inlet that might open a paſſage to the weſt, it does not appear that he landed any where during this extenſive run; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to England, without attempting either ſettlement or conqueſt in any part of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.<note n="†" place="bottom">Monſon's Naval Tracts, in Churchill's Collect. iii. 211.</note>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:036237_0019_10088F3489A56BE0"/>If it had been Henry's purpoſe to proſecute the object of the commiſſion given by him to Cabot, and to take poſſeſſion of the countries which he had diſcovered, the ſucceſs of this voyage muſt have anſwered his moſt ſanguine expectations. His ſubjects were, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the firſt Europeans who had viſited that part of the American continent, and were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to whatever right of property prior diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is ſuppoſed to confer. Countries which ſtretched in an uninterrupted courſe through ſuch a large portion of the temperate zone, opened a proſpect of ſettling to advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mild climates, and in a fertile ſoil. But by the time that Cabot returned to England, he found both the ſtate of affairs and the king's inclination unfavourable to any ſcheme, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of which would have required tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and leiſure. Henry was involved in a war with Scotland, and his kingdom was not yet fully compoſed, after the commotion excited by a formidable inſurrection of his own ſubjects in the weſt. An ambaſſador from Ferdinand of Arragon was then in London; and as Henry ſet a high value upon the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of that monarch, for whoſe character he profeſſed much admiration, perhaps from its ſimilarity to his own, and was endeavouring to ſtrengthen their union, by negociating the marriage which afterwards took place between his eldeſt ſon and the princeſs Catharine, he

was cautious of giving any offence to a prince, jealous to exceſs of all his rights. From the poſition of the iſlands and continent which Cabot had diſcovered, it was evident that they lay within the limits of the ample donative which the bounty of Alexander VI. had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon Ferdinand and Iſabella. No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in that age, queſtioned the validity of a Papal grant; and Ferdinand was not of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to relinquiſh any claim to which he had a ſhadow of title.

No attempt towards diſcovery was made in England during the remainder of his reign; and Sebaſtian Cabot, finding no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for his active talents there, entered into the ſervice of Spain <note n="*" place="bottom">Some ſchemes of diſcovery ſeem to have been formed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land towards the beginning of the ſixteenth century.

            <p>This is the moſt probable account of the ſudden ceſſation of Henry's activity, after ſuch

ſucceſs in his firſt eſſay as might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to perſevere. The advantages of commerce, as well as its nature, were ſo little underſtood in England about this period, that by an act of parliament in the year 1488, the taking of intereſt for the uſe of money was prohibited under ſevere penalties.<note n="‖" place="bottom">3 Hen.

But it is more difficult to diſcover what prevented this ſcheme of Henry VII. from being reſumed during the reigns of his ſon and grandſon; and to give any reaſon why no attempt was made, either to explore the northern continent of America more fully, or to ſettle in it. Henry VIII. was frequently at open enmity with Spain; the value of the Spaniſh acquiſitions in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica had become ſo well known, as might have excited his deſire to obtain ſome footing in thoſe opulent regions; and during a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of his reign, the prohibitions in a papal bull would not have reſtrained him from making encroachment upon the Spaniſh dominions. But the reign of Henry was not favourable to the progreſs of diſcovery. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

one period of it, the active part which he took in the affairs of the continent, and the vigour with which he engaged in the conteſt between the two mighty rivals, Charles V. and Francis I. gave full occupation to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing ſpirit both of the king and of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. During another period of his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, his famous controverſy with the court of Rome kept the nation in perpetual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuſpenſe. Engroſſed by thoſe objects, neither the king nor the nobles had inclination or leiſure to turn their attention to new pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; and without their patronage and aid, the commercial part of the nation was too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable to make any effort of conſequence. Though England, by its total ſeparation from the church of Rome, ſoon after the acceſſion of Edward VI. diſclaimed that authority, which, by its preſumptuous partition of the globe between two favourite nations, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the activity of every other ſtate within very narrow limits, yet a feeble minority, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with faction, was not a juncture for forming ſchemes of doubtful ſucceſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote utility. The bigotry of Mary, and her marriage with Philip, diſpoſed her to pay a ſacred regard to that grant of the Holy See, which veſted in a huſband, on whom ſhe doated, an excluſive right to every part of the New World. Thus, through a ſingular ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of various cauſes, ſixty-one years elapſed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036237_0023_10088F416BAD3A88"/>
from the time that the Engliſh diſcovered North America, during which their monarchs gave little attention to that country which was deſtined to be annexed to their crown, and to be a chief ſource of its opulence and power.</p>
            <p>But though the public contributed little towards the progreſs of diſcovery, naval ſkill, knowledge of commerce, and a ſpirit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, began to ſpread among the Engliſh. During the reign of Henry VIII. ſeveral new channels of trade were opened, and private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers viſited remote countries with which England had formerly no intercourſe. Some merchants of Briſtol having fitted out two ſhips for the ſouthern regions of America, committed the conduct of them to Sebaſtian Cabot, who had quitted the ſervice of Spain. He viſited (1516) the coaſts of Braſil, and touched at the iſlands of Hiſpaniola and Puer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rico; and though this voyage ſeems not to have been beneficial to the adventurers, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſphere of Engliſh navigation, and added to the national ſtock of nautical ſcience.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 498.</note> Though diſappointed in their expectations of profit in this firſt eſſay, the merchants were not diſcouraged. They ſent, ſucceſſively, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral veſſels from different ports towards the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036237_0024_10088F42F1352330"/>
ſame quarter, and ſeem to have carried on an interloping trade in the Portugueſe ſettlements with ſucceſs.<note n="†" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 700.</note> Nor was it only towards the weſt, that the activity of the Engliſh was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. Other merchants began to extend their commercial views to the eaſt; and by eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing an intercourſe with ſeveral iſlands in the Archipelago, and with ſome of the towns on the coaſt of Syria, they found a new mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for woollen cloths, (the only manufacture which the nation had begun to cultivate,) and ſupplied their countrymen with various pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the eaſt, formerly unknown, or received from the Venetians at an exorbitant price.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. ii. 96, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the diſcovery of a ſhorter paſſage to the Eaſt Indies, by the north-weſt, was ſtill the favourite project of the nation, which beheld, with envy, the vaſt wealth that flowed into Portugal, from its commerce with thoſe regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The ſcheme was accordingly twice reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (1527 and 1536) under the long adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of Henry VIII. firſt with ſome ſlender aid from the king, and then by private mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Both voyages were diſtaſtrous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful. In the former one of the ſhips was loſt. In the latter, the ſtock of proviſions was ſo ill proportioned to the number of the crew,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036237_0025_10088F448291CA88"/>
that although they were but ſix months at ſea, many periſhed with hunger, and the ſurvivors were conſtrained to ſupport life by feeding on the bodies of their dead companions.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt, i, 213, &amp;c. iii. 129.130.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The vigour of the commercial ſpirit did not relax in the reign of Edward VI. The great fiſhery on the banks of Newfoundland became an object of attention; and from ſome regulations for the encouragement of that branch of trade, it ſeems to have been proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with activity and ſucceſs.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. iii. 131.</note> But the proſpect of opening a communication with China and the Spice Iſlands, by ſome other route than round the Cape of Good Hope, ſtill continued to allure the Engliſh, more than any ſcheme of adventure. Cabot, whoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was deſervedly of high authority in whatever related to naval enterprize, warmly urged the Engliſh to make another attempt to diſcover this paſſage. As it had been thrice ſearched for in vain, by ſteering towards the north-weſt, he propoſed that a trial ſhould now be made by the north-eaſt; and ſupported this advice by ſuch plauſible reaſons and conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as excited ſanguine expectations of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Several noblemen and perſons of rank, together with ſome principal merchants, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſociated for this purpoſe were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036237_0026_10088F4743A61500"/>
by a charter from the king, under the title of The Company of Merchant Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers for the Diſcovery of Regions, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Iſlands, and Places unknown. Cabot, who was appointed governor of this company, (1553) ſoon fitted out two ſhips and a bark, furniſhed with inſtructions in his own hand, which diſcover the great extent both of his naval ſkill and mercantile ſagacity.</p>
            <p>Sir Hugh Willoughby, who was entruſted with the command, ſtood directly (May 10) northwards along the coaſt of Norway, and doubled the North Cape. But in that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtous ocean, his ſmall ſquadron was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a violent ſtorm. Willoughby's ſhip and the bark took refuge in an obſcure harbour in a deſert part of Ruſſian Lapland, where he and all his companions were frozen to death. Richard Chancelour, the captain of the other veſſel was more fortunate; he entered the White Sea, and wintered in ſafety at Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. Though no veſſel of any foreign nation had ever viſited that quarter of the globe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the inhabitants received their new viſitors with an hoſpitality which would have done honour to a more poliſhed people. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh learned there, that this was a province of a vaſt empire, ſubject to the Great Duke or Czar of Muſcovy, who reſided in a great city twelve hundred miles from Archangel. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036237_0027_10088F4B159BF798"/>
with a ſpirit becoming an officer em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in an expedition for diſcovery, did not heſitate a moment about the part which he ought to take, and ſet out for that diſtant capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. On his arrival in Moſcow, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to audience, and delivered a letter which the captain of each ſhip had received from Edward VI. for the ſovereign of whatever country they ſhould diſcover, to John Vaſilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witz, who at that time filled the Ruſſian throne. John, though he ruled over his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with the cruelty and caprice of a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſpot, was not deſtitute of political ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. He inſtantly perceived the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences that might flow from opening an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between his dominions and the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern nations of Europe; and, delighted with the fortunate event to which he was indebted for this unexpected benefit, he treated Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour with great reſpect; and, by a letter to the king of England, (Feb. 1554) invited his ſubjects to trade in the Ruſſian dominions, with ample promiſes of protection and favour.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt, i. 226, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Chancelour, on his return, found Mary ſeated on the Engliſh throne. The ſucceſs of this voyage, the diſcovery of a new courſe of navigation, the eſtabliſhment of commerce with a vaſt empire, the name of which was then hardly known in the weſt, and the hope
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036237_0028_10088F4C9BC79668"/>
of arriving, in this direction, at thoſe regions which had been ſo long the object of deſire, excited a wonderful ardour to proſecute the deſign with greater vigour. Mary, implicitly guided by her huſband in every act of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, was not unwilling to turn the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial activity of her ſubjects towards a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where it could not excite the jealouſy of Spain, by encroaching on its poſſeſſions in the New World. She wrote to John Vaſilowitz in the moſt reſpectful terms, courting his friendſhip. She confirmed the charter of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VI. empowered Chancelour, and two agents appointed by the Company, to negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with the Czar in her name; and according to the ſpirit of that age, ſhe granted an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive right of trade with Ruſſia to the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Merchant Adventurers.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt. i, 358. &amp;c,</note> In virtue of this, they not only eſtabliſhed an active and gainful commerce with Ruſſia, but, in hopes of reaching China, they puſhed their diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries eaſtwards to the coaſt of Nova Zembla, the ſtraits of Waigatz, and towards the mouth of the great river Oby. But in thoſe frozen ſeas, which Nature ſeems not to have deſtined for navigation, they were expoſed to innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſaſters and met with ſucceſſive diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Nor were their attempts to open a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with India made only in this channel.

They appointed ſome of their factors to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Ruſſian caravans, which travelled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Perſia by the way of Aſtracan and the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Sea, inſtructing them to penetrate as far as poſſible towards the eaſt, and to endeavour, not only to eſtabliſh a trade with thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but to acquire every information that might afford any light towards the diſcovery of a paſſage to China by the north-eaſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt. i. 301.</note> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a variety of dangers to which they were expoſed in travelling through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny provinces, inhabited by fierce and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nations, ſome of theſe factors rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The ſucceſsful progreſs of the Merchant Adventurers in diſcovery, rouzed the emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their countrymen, and turned their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity into new channels. A commercial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, hitherto unattempted by the Engliſh, having been opened with the coaſt of Barbary, the ſpecimens which that afforded of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable productions of Africa, invited ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036237_0030_10088F540DF89190"/>
navigators to viſit the more remote provinces of that quarter of the globe. They ſailed along its weſtern ſhore, traded in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ports on both ſides of the Line, and after acquiring conſiderable knowledge of thoſe countries, returned with a cargo of goldduſt, ivory, and other rich commodities, little known at that time in England. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with Africa ſeems to have been purſued with vigour, and was at that time no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent than lucrative; for as the Engliſh had then no demand for ſlaves, they carried it on for many years, without violating the rights of humanity. Thus far did the Engliſh advance during a period which may be conſidered as the infant ſtate of their navigation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and feeble as its ſteps at that time may appear to us, we trace them with an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curioſity, and look back with ſatisfaction to the early eſſays of that ſpirit, which we now behold in the full maturity of its ſtrength. Even in thoſe firſt efforts of the Engliſh, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent obſerver will diſcern preſages of their future improvement. As ſoon as the activity of the nation was put in motion, it took vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous directions, and exerted itſelf in each with that ſteady, perſevering induſtry, which is the ſoul and guide of commerce. Neither diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the hardſhips and dangers to which they were expoſed in thoſe northern ſeas which they firſt attempted to explore, nor afraid of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036237_0031_10088F5592343B88"/>
venturing into the ſultry climates of the torrid zone, the Engliſh, during the reigns of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VIII. Edward VI. and Mary opened ſome of the moſt conſiderable ſources of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial opulence, and gave a beginning to their trade with Turkey, with Africa, with Ruſſia, and with Newfoundland.</p>
            <p>By the Progreſs which England had already made in navigation and commerce, it was now prepared for advancing further; and on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Elizabeth to the throne, a period commenced, extremely auſpicious to this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which was riſing in the nation. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic tranquillity of the kingdom, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, almoſt without interruption, during the courſe of a long and proſperous reign; the peace with foreign nations, that ſubſiſted more than twenty years after Elizabeth was ſeated on the throne; the Queen's attentive economy, which exempted her ſubjects from the burden of taxes oppreſſive to trade; the popularity of her adminiſtration; were all favourable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial enterpriſe, and called it forth into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exertion. The diſcerning eye of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth having early perceived that the ſecurity of a kingdom environed by the ſea, depended on its naval force, ſhe began her government with adding to the number and ſtrength of the royal navy; which, during a factious minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a reign intent on no object but that of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036237_0032_10088F583B64F8A8"/>
ſuppreſſing hereſy, had been neglected, and ſuffered to decay. She filled her arſenals with naval ſtores; ſhe built ſeveral ſhips of great force, according to the ideas of that age, and encouraged her ſubjects to imitate her example, that they might no longer depend on foreigners from whom the Engliſh had hitherto purchaſed all veſſels of any conſiderable burden.<note n="*" place="bottom">Camd. Annales. p. 70. edit. 1615; fol.</note> By thoſe efforts, the ſkill of the Engliſh artificers was improved, the number of ſailors increaſed, and the attention of the public turned to the navy, as the moſt important national object. Inſtead of abandoning any of the new channels of commerce which had been opened in the three preceding reigns, the Engliſh frequented them with greater aſſiduity, and the patronage of their ſovereign added vigour to all their efforts. In order to ſecure to them the continuance of their excluſive trade with Ruſſia, Elizabeth cultivated the connection with John Vaſilowitz, which had been formed by her predeceſſor, and, by ſucceſſive embaſſies, gained his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo thoroughly, that the Engliſh enjoyed that lucrative privilege during his long reign. She encouraged the Company of Merchant Adventurers, whoſe monopoly of the Ruſſian trade was confirmed by act of parliament,<note n="†" place="bottom">Hakluyt, i. 369.</note> to reſume their deſign of penetrating into Perſia by land. Their ſecond attempt, (1562,) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036237_0033_10088F5B43B40750"/>
with greater prudence, or undertaken at a more favourable juncture than the firſt, was more ſucceſsful. Their agents arrived in the Perſian Court, and obtained ſuch protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and immunities from the Shah, that for a courſe of years they carried on a gainful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in his kingdom;<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. i. 344, &amp;c.</note> and by frequenting the various provinces of Perſia, be ame ſo well acquainted with the vaſt riches of the eaſt, as ſtrengthened their deſign of opening a more direct intercourſe with thoſe fertile regions by ſea.</p>
            <p>But as every effort to accompliſh this by the north-eaſt had proved abortive, a ſcheme was formed, under the patronage of the Earl of Warwich, the head of the enterpriſing family of Dudley, to make a new attempt, by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an oppoſite courſe by the north-weſt. The conduct of this enterpriſe was committed to Martin Frobiſher, an officer of experience and reputation. In three ſucceſſive voyages (1576, 1577, and 1578) he explored the inhoſpitable coaſt of Labrador, and that of Greenland, (to which Elizabeth gave the name of <hi>Meta In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita,</hi>) without diſcovering any probable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of that paſſage to India for which he ſought. This new diſappointment was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly felt, and might have damped the ſpirit of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036237_0034_10088F5F15020958"/>
naval enterprize among the Engliſh, if it had not reſumed freſh vigour, amidſt the general exultation of the nation, upon the ſucceſsful expedition of Francis Drake. That bold na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigator, emulous of the glory which Magellan had acquired by ſailing round the globe, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſcheme of attempting a voyage, which all Europe had admired for ſixty years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out venturing to follow the Portugueſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer in his adventurous courſe. Drake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this with a feeble ſquadron, in which the largeſt veſſel did not exceed a hundred tons, and he accompliſhed it, with no leſs credit to himſelf, than honour to his country. Even in this voyage, conducted with other views, Drake ſeems not to have been inattentive to the favourite object of his countrymen, the diſcovery of a new route to India. Before he quitted the Pacific Ocean, in order to ſtretch towards the Philippine iſlands, he ranged along the coaſt of California, as high as the lattitude of forty-two degrees north, in hopes of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, on that ſide, the communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two ſeas, which had ſo often been ſearched for in vain on the other. But this was the only unſucceſsful attempt of Drake. The exceſſive cold of the climate, intolerable to men who had long been accuſtomed to tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical heat, obliged him to ſtop ſhort in his progreſs towards the north; and whether or not there be any paſſage from the Pacific to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036237_0035_10088F609DB27678"/>
the Atlantic Ocean in that quarter, is a point ſtill unaſcertained.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 440. Camd. Annal. 301, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>From this period, the Engliſh ſeem to have confided in their own abilities and courage, as equal to any naval enterprize. They had now viſited every region to which navigation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in that age, and had rivalled the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of higheſt repute for naval ſkill in its moſt ſplendid exploit. But notwithſtanding the knowledge which they had acquired of the different quarters of the globe, they had not hitherto attempted any ſettlement out of their own country. Their merchants had not yet acquired ſuch a degree, either of wealth or of political influence, as were requiſite towards carrying a ſcheme of colonization into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Perſons of noble birth were deſtitute of the ideas and information which might have diſpoſed them to patronize ſuch a deſign. The growing power of Spain, however, and the aſcendant over the other nations of Europe to which it had attained under Charles V. and his ſon, naturally turned the attention of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind towards the importance of thoſe ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the New World, to which they were ſo much indebted for that pre-eminence. The intercourſe between Spain and England, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reign of Philip and Mary; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036237_0036_10088F638CF2B668"/>
of the Spaniſh nobility to the Engliſh court, while Philip reſided there; the ſtudy of the Spaniſh language, which became faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and the tranſlation of ſeveral hiſtories of America into Engliſh, diffuſed gradually through the nation a more diſtinct knowledge of the policy of Spain in planting its colonies, and of the advantages which it derived from them. When hoſtilities commenced between Elizabeth and Philip, the proſpect of annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spain by ſea opened a new career to the enterpriſing ſpirit of the Engliſh nobility. Almoſt every eminent leader of the age aimed at diſtinguiſhing himſelf by naval exploits. That ſervice, and the ideas connected with it, the diſcovery of unknown countries, the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of diſtant colonies, and the enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of commerce by new commodities, became familiar to perſons of rank.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of all thoſe concurring cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Engliſh began ſeriouſly to form plans of ſettling colonies in thoſe parts of America, which hitherto they had only viſited. The projectors and patrons of theſe plans were moſtly perſons of rank and influence. Among them, Sir Humphry Gilbert of Compton in Devonſhire, ought to be mentioned with the diſtinction due to the conductor of the firſt Engliſh colony to America.

ſervices both in France and Ireland; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving afterwards turned his attention to naval affairs, he publiſhed a diſcourſe concerning the probability of a north-weſt paſſage, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered no inconſiderable portion both of learning and ingenuity, mingled with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, the credulity, and ſanguine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which incite men to new and hazardous undertakings.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 11.</note> With thoſe talents, he was deemed a proper perſon to be employed in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing a new colony, and eaſily obtained from the Queen (June 11. 1578) letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, veſting in him ſufficient powers for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>As this is the firſt charter to a colony, granted by the Crown of England, the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in it merit particular attention, as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the ideas of that age, with reſpect to the nature of ſuch ſettlements. Elizabeth autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes him to diſcover and take poſſeſſion of all remote and barbarous lands, unoccupied by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian prince or people. She veſts in him, his heirs and aſſigns, for ever, the full right of property in the ſoil of thoſe countries whereof he ſhall take poſſeſſion.

She empowers him, his heirs and aſſigns, to diſpoſe of whatever portion of thoſe lands he ſhall judge meet to perſons ſettled there, in fee-ſimple, according to the laws of England. She ordains, that all the lands granted to Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert ſhall hold of the Crown of England by homage, on payment of the fifth part of the gold or ſilver ore found there. She confers upon him, his heirs and aſſigns, the complete juriſdictions and royalties, as well marine as other, within the ſaid lands and ſeas thereunto adjoining; and as their common ſafety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt would render good government neceſſary in their new ſettlements, ſhe gave Gilbert, his heirs and aſſigns, full power to convict, puniſh, pardon, govern, and rule, by their good diſcretion and policy, as well in cauſes capital or criminal as civil, both marine and other, all perſons who ſhall from time to time ſettle within the ſaid countries, according to ſuch ſtatutes, laws, and ordinances as ſhall be by him, his heirs and aſſigns, deviſed and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed for their better government.

            <p>With thoſe extraordinary powers, ſuited to the high notions of authority and prerogative prevalent in England during the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, but very repugnant to more recent ideas with reſpect to the rights of free men, who voluntarily unite to form a colony, Gilbert began to collect aſſociates, and to prepare for embarkation. His own character, and the zealous efforts of his half-brother, Walter Ralegh, who, even in his early youth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played thoſe ſplendid talents, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted ſpirit, which create admiration and confidence, ſoon procured him a ſufficient number of followers. But his ſucceſs was not ſuited either to the ſanguine hopes of his countrymen, or to the expence of his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Two expeditions, both of which he conducted in perſon, ended diſaſtrouſly. In the laſt, (1580) he himſelf periſhed, without having effected his intended ſettlement on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of America, or performing any thing more worthy of notice, than the empty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of taking poſſeſſion of the iſland of Newfoundland, in the name of his ſovereign.

crew; his total ignorance of the countries which he purpoſed to occupy; his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in approaching the continent too far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north, where the inhoſpitable coaſt of Cape Breton did not invite them to ſettle; the ſhipwreck of his largeſt veſſel; and above all, the ſcanty proviſion which the funds of a private man could make of what was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for eſtabliſhing a new colony, were the true cauſes to which the failure of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe muſt be imputed, not to any deficiency of abilities or reſolution in its leader<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 143, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>But the miſcarriage of a ſcheme, in which Gilbert had waſted his fortune, did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Ralegh. He adopted all his brother's ideas; and applying to the Queen, in whoſe favour he ſtood high at that time, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a patent, (1584, March 26) with. ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and prerogatives as ample as had been granted unto Gilbert.<note n="†" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 243.</note> Ralegh, no leſs eager to execute than to undertake the ſcheme, inſtantly diſpatched (April 27) two ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, under the command of Amadas and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, two officers of truſt, to viſit the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which he intended to ſettle, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome previous knowledge of their coaſts, their ſoil, and productions. In order to avoid Gilbert's error, in holding too far north, they
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036237_0041_100890EE5A6C1190"/>
took their courſe by the Canaries and the Weſt India iſlands, and approached the North American continent by the Gulph of Florida. Unfortunately their chief reſearches were made in that part of the country now known by the name of North Carolina, the province in America moſt deſtitute of commodious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. They touched firſt at an iſland, which they call Wokocon (probably Ocakoke,) ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on the inlet into Pamplicoe Sound, and then at Raonoke, near the mouth of Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle Sound. In both, they had ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the natives, whom they found to be ſavages, with all the characteriſtic qualities of uncivilized life, bravery, averſion to labour, hoſpitality, a propenſity to admire, and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to exchange their rude productions for Engliſh commodities, eſpecially for iron, or any of the uſeful metals of which they were deſtitute. After ſpending a few weeks in this traffic, and in viſiting ſome parts of the adjacent continent, Amadas and Barlow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to England, (Sept. 15) with two of the natives, and gave ſuch ſplendid deſcriptions of the beauty of the country, the fertility of the ſoil, and the mildneſs of the climate, that Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, delighted with the idea of occupying a territory, ſuperior, ſo far, to the barren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions towards the north hitherto viſited by her ſubjects, beſtowed on it the name of Virginia;

            </p>
            <p>Their report encouraged Ralegh to haſten his preparations for taking poſſeſſion of ſuch an inviting property. He fitted out a ſquadron of ſeven ſmall ſhips, under the command of Sir Richard Greenville, a man of honourable birth, and of courage ſo undaunted as to be conſpicuous even in that gallant age. But the ſpirit of that predatory war which the Engliſh carried on againſt Spain, mingled with this ſcheme of ſettlement; and on this account, as well as from unacquaintance with a more direct and ſhorter courſe to North America, Greenville ſailed by the Weſt India iſlands. He ſpent ſome time in cruiſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe, and in taking prizes; ſo that it was towards the cloſe of June before he arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the coaſt of North America. He touched at both the iſlands where Amadas and Barlow had landed, and made ſome excurſions into different parts of the continent round Pamplicoe and Albemarle Sounds. But as, unfortunately, he did not advance far enough towards the north, to diſcover the noble Bay of Cheſapeak, he eſtabliſhed the colony (Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 25) which he left on the iſland of Raon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oke, an incommodious ſtation, without any ſafe harbour, and almoſt uninhabited.<note n="†" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 251.</note>

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:036237_0043_100890F5B5FD9820"/>This colony conſiſted only of one hundred and eighty perſons, under the command of Captain Lane, aſſiſted by ſome men of note, the moſt diſtinguiſhed of whom was Hariot, an eminent mathematician. Their chief em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, during a reſidence of nine months, was to obtain a more extenſive knowledge of the country; and their reſearches were carried on with greater ſpirit, and reached farther than could have been expected from a colony ſo feeble, and in a ſtation ſo diſadvantageous. But from the ſame impatience of indigent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers to acquire ſudden wealth, which gave a wrong direction to the induſtry of the Spaniards in their ſettlements, the greater part of the Engliſh ſeem to have conſidered nothing as worthy of attention but mines of gold and ſilver. Theſe they ſought for, wherever they came; theſe they enquired after with unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried eagerneſs. The ſavages ſoon diſcovered the favourite objects which allured them, and artfully amuſed them with ſo many tales con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning pearl fiſheries, and rich mines of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious metals, that Lane and his companions waſted their time and activity in the chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical purſuit of theſe, inſtead of labouring to raiſe proviſions for their own ſubſiſtence. On diſcovering the deceit of the Indians, they were ſo much exaſperated, that from expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and reproaches, they proceeded to open hoſtility (1586). The ſupplies of proviſions
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036237_0044_100890F76CAD3D98"/>
which they had been accuſtomed to receive from the natives were of courſe withdrawn. Through their own negligence, no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution had been taken for their ſupport. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh, having engaged in a ſcheme too expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive for his narrow funds, had not been able to ſend them that recruit of ſtores with which Greenville had promiſed to furniſh them early in the ſpring. The colony, reduced to the utmoſt diſtreſs, and on the point of periſhing with famine, was preparing to diſperſe into different diſtricts of the country in queſt of food, (June 1) when Sir Francis Drake ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with his fleet, returning from a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful expedition againſt the Spaniards in the Weſt Indies. A ſcheme which he formed, of furniſhing Lane and his aſſociates with ſuch ſupplies as might enable them to remain with comfort in their ſtation, was diſappointed by a ſudden ſtorm, in which a ſmall veſſel that he deſtined for their ſervice was daſhed to pieces; and as he could not ſupply them with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at their joint requeſt, as they were worn out with fatigue and famine, he carried them home to England (June 19.)<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 255.

produced no effect but that of affording a more complete knowledge of the country; as it enabled Hariot, a man of ſcience and obſervation, to deſcribe its ſoil, climate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, and the manners of its inhabitants, with a degree of accuracy which merits no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable praiſe, when compared with the childiſh and marvellous tales publiſhed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the early viſitants of the New World. There is another conſequence of this abortive colony important enough to entitle it to a place in hiſtory. Lane and his aſſociates, by their conſtant intercourſe with the Indians, had acquired a reliſh for their favourite enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſmoking tobacco; to the uſe of which, the credulity of that people not only aſcribed a thouſand imaginary virtues, but their ſuperſtition conſidered the plant itſelf as a gracious gift of the gods, for the ſolace of human kind, and the moſt acceptable offering which man can preſent to heaven.<note n="*" place="bottom">Harlot ap.

America, Pars i</note> They brought with them a ſpecimen of this new commodity to England, and taught their countrymen the method of uſing it; which Ralegh, and ſome young men of faſhion, fondly adopted. From imitation of them, from love of novelty, and from the favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion of its ſalutary qualities entertained by ſeveral phyſicians, the practice ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036237_0046_100890FF2532A0F8"/>
the Engliſh. The Spaniards and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe had, previous to this, introduced it in other parts of Europe. This habit of taking tobacco gradually extended from the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the north to thoſe of the ſouth, and in one form or other ſeems to be equally grateful to the inhabitants of every climate; and by a ſingular caprice of the human ſpecies, no leſs inexplicable than unexampled, (ſo bewitching is the acquired taſte for a weed of no manifeſt utility, and at firſt not only unpleaſant, but nauſeous,) that it has become almoſt as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal as the demands of thoſe appetites origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally implanted in our nature. Smoking was the firſt mode of taking tobacco in England; and we learn from the comic writers towards the cloſe of the ſixteenth century and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſeventeenth, that this was deemed one of the accompliſhments of a man of faſhion and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>A few days after Drake departed from Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anoke, a ſmall bark, diſpatched by Ralegh with a ſupply of ſtores for the colony, landed at the place where the Engliſh had ſettled; but on finding it deſerted by their countrymen, they returned to England. The bark was hardly gone, when Sir Richard Greenville ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with three ſhips. After ſearching in vain for the colony which he had planted, without being able to learn what had befallen

it, he left fifteen of his crew to keep poſſeſſion of the iſland. This handful of men was ſoon overpowered and cut in pieces by the ſavages.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hakluyt, iii. 265.283.</note>

            <p>Though all Ralegh's efforts to eſtabliſh a colony in Virginia had hitherto proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and had been defeated by a ſucceſſion of diſaſters and diſappointments, neither his hopes nor reſources were exhauſted. Early in the following year, (1587) he fitted out three ſhips, under the command of Captain John White, who carried thither a colony more numerous than that which had been ſettled under Lane. On their arrival in Virginia, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter viewing the face of the country covered with one continued foreſt, which to them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared an uninhabited wild, as it was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied only by a few ſcattered tribes of ſavages, they diſcovered that they were deſtitute of many things which they deemed eſſentially neceſſary towards their ſubſiſtence in ſuch an uncomfortable ſituation; and, with one voice, requeſted White, their commander, to return to England, as the perſon among them moſt likely to ſolicit, with efficacy, the ſupply on which depended the exiſtence of the colony. White landed in his native country at a moſt unfavourable ſeaſon for the negociation which he had undertaken. He found the nation in
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036237_0048_10089102555D48B8"/>
univerſal alarm at the formidable preparations of Philip II. to invade England, and collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all its force to oppoſe the fleet to which he had arrogantly given the name of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Armada. Ralegh, Greenville, and all the moſt zealous patrons of the new ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were called to act a diſtinguiſhed part in the operations of a year (1588) equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and glorious to England. Amidſt danger ſo imminent, and during a conteſt for the honour of their ſovereign and the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of their country, it was impoſſible to attend to a leſs important and remote object. The unfortunate colony in Roanoke received no ſupply, and periſhed miſerably by famine, or by the unrelenting cruelty of thoſe barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by whom they were ſurrounded.</p>
            <p>During the remainder of Elizabeth's reign, the ſcheme of eſtabliſhing a colony in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia was not reſumed. Ralegh, with a moſt aſpiring mind and extraordinary talents, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by knowledge no leſs uncommon, had the ſpirit and the defects of a projector. Allured by new objects, and always giving the preference to ſuch as were moſt ſplendid and arduous, he was apt to engage in undertaking<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo vaſt and ſo various, as to be far beyond his power of accompliſhing. He was now intent on peopling and improving a large diſtrict of country in Ireland, of which he had obtained
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036237_0049_100891062B494898"/>
a grant from the Queen. He was a deep ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer in the ſcheme of fitting out a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful armament againſt Spain, in order to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Don Antonio on the throne of Portugal. He had begun to form his favourite, but viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary plan, of penetrating into the province of Guiana, where he fondly dreamed of taking poſſeſſion of inexhauſtible wealth, flowing from the richeſt mines in the New World. Amidſt this multiplicity of projects, of ſuch promiſing appearance, and recommended by novelty, he naturally became cold towards his ancient and hitherto unprofitable ſcheme of ſettling a colony in Virginia, and was eaſily induced to aſſign his right of property in that country, which he had never viſited, together with all the privileges contained in his patent, to Sir Thomas Smith, and a company of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in London (March, 1596.) This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſatisfied with a paltry traffic carried on by a few ſmall barks, made no attempt to take poſſeſſion of the country. Thus, after a period of a hundred and ſix years from the time that Cabot diſcovered North America, in the name of Henry VII. and of twenty years from the time that Ralegh planted the firſt colony, there was not a ſingle Engliſhman ſettled there at the demiſe of Queen Elizabeth, in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and three.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:036237_0050_10089109F5B6EA60"/>I have already explained the cauſes of this, during the period previous to the acceſſion of Elizabeth. Other cauſes produced the ſame effect under her adminiſtration. Though for one half of her reign England was engaged in no foreign war, and commerce enjoyed that perfect ſecurity which is friendly to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; though the glory of her latter years gave the higheſt tone of elevation and vigour to the national ſpirit; the Queen herſelf, from her extreme parſimony, and her averſion to demand extraordinary ſupplies of her ſubjects, was more apt to reſtrain than to ſecond the ardent genius of her people. Several of the moſt ſplendid enterprizes in her reign were concerted and executed by private adventurers. All the ſchemes for colonization were carried on by the funds of individuals, without any public aid. Even the felicity of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was adverſe to the eſtabliſhment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote colonies. So powerful is the attraction of our native ſoil, and ſuch our fortunate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality to the laws and manners of our own country, that men ſeldom chooſe to abandon it, unleſs they be driven away by oppreſſion, or allured by vaſt proſpects of ſudden wealth. But the provinces of America in which the Engliſh attempted to ſettle, did not, like thoſe occupied by Spain, invite them thither by any appearance of ſilver or golden mines. All their hopes of gain were diſtant; and they ſaw
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036237_0051_1008910C672B9E50"/>
that nothing could be earned but by perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exertions of induſtry. The maxims of Elizabeth's adminiſtration were, in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tenor, ſo popular, as did not force her ſubjects to emigrate, in order to eſcape from the heavy or vexatious hand of power. It ſeems to have been with difficulty that theſe ſlender bands of planters were collected, on which the writers of that age beſtow the name of the firſt and ſecond Virginian colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The fulneſs of time for Engliſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization was not yet arrived.</p>
            <p>But the ſucceſſion of the Scottiſh line to the crown of England haſtened its approach. James was hardly ſeated on the throne before he diſcovered his pacific intentions, and he ſoon terminated the long war which had been carried on between Spain and England, by an amicable treaty. From that period, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted tranquillity continued during his reign. Many perſons of high rank, and of ardent am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to whom the war with Spain had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded conſtant employment, and preſented alluring proſpects, not only of fame but of wealth, ſoon became ſo impatient of languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home without occupation or object, that their invention was on the ſtretch to find ſome exerciſe for their activity and talents. To both theſe, North America ſeemed to open a new field, and ſchemes of carrying colonies
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:036237_0052_1008910F5AF4A668"/>
thither became more general and more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular.</p>
            <p>A voyage, undertaken by Bartholemew Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold in the laſt year of the Queen, facilitated, as well as encouraged, the execution of theſe ſchemes. He ſailed from Falmouth in a ſmall bark, with thirty two men. Inſtead of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing former navigators in their unneceſſary circuit by the Weſt India iſles and the Gulf of Florida, Goſnold ſteered due weſt, as nearly as the winds would permit, and was the firſt Engliſh commander who reached Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica by this ſhorter and more direct courſe. That part of the continent which he firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried was a promontory in the province now called Maſſachuſets Bay, to which he gave the name of Cape Cod. Holding along the coaſt, as it ſtretched towards the ſouth-weſt, he touched at two iſlands, one of which he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Martha's Vineyard, the other Elizabeth's Iſland; and viſited the adjoining continent, and traded with its inhabitants. He and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were ſo much delighted every where with the inviting aſpect of the country, that notwithſtanding the ſmallneſs of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a part of them conſented to remain there. But when they had leiſure to reflect upon the fate of former ſettlers in America, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a reſolution formed in the firſt warmth of their admiration; and Goſnold returned to
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036237_0053_1008911295964E60"/>
England in leſs than four months from the time of his departure.<note n="*" place="bottom">Purchas, iv. p. 1647.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This voyage, however inconſiderable it may appear, had important effects. The Engliſh now diſcovered the aſpect of the American continent to be extremely inviting far to the north of the place where they had formerly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſettle. The coaſt of a vaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſtretching through the moſt deſirable cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, lay before them. The richneſs of its virgin ſoil promiſed a certain recompence to their induſtry. In its interior provinces unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſources of wealth might open, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known objects of commerce might be found. Its diſtance from England was diminiſhed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a third part, by the new courſe which Goſnold had pointed out. Plans for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colonies began to be formed in different parts of the kingdom; and before theſe were ripe for execution, one ſmall veſſel was ſent out by the merchants of Briſtol, another by the Earl of Southampton and Lord Arundel of Wardour, in order to learn whether Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold's account of the country was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a juſt repreſentation of its ſtate, or as the exaggerated deſcription of a fond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer. Both returned with a full confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his veracity, and with the addition
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036237_0054_100891141C4BF520"/>
of ſo many new circumſtances in favour of the country, acquired by a more extenſive view of it, as greatly increaſed the deſire of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
            <p>The moſt active and efficacious promoter of this was Richard Hakluyt, prebendary of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, to whom England is more indebted for its American poſſeſſions than to any man of that age. Formed under a kinſman of the ſame name, eminent for naval and commercial knowledge, he imbibed a ſimilar taſte, and applied early to the ſtudy of geography and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation. Theſe favourite ſciences engroſſed his attention, and to diffuſe a reliſh for them was the great object of his life. In order to excite his countrymen to naval enterprize, by flattering their national vanity, he publiſhed, in the year one thouſand five hundred and eighty nine, his valuable collection of voyages and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries made by Engliſhmen. In order to ſupply them with what information might be derived from the experience of the moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful foreign navigators, he tranſlated ſome of the beſt accounts of the progreſs of the Spaniards and Portugueſe in their voyages both to the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, into the Engliſh tongue. He was conſulted with reſpect to many of the attempts towards diſcovery or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonization during the latter part of Elizabeth's reign. He correſponded with the officers who
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036237_0055_10089116A33A0930"/>
conducted them, directed their reſearches to proper objects, and publiſhed the hiſtory of their exploits. By the zealous endeavours of a perſon, equally reſpected by men of rank and men of buſineſs, many of both orders formed an aſſociation to eſtabliſh colonies in America, and petitioned the king for the ſanction of his authority to warrant the execution of their plans.</p>
            <p>James, who prided himſelf on his profound ſkill in the ſcience of government, and who had turned his attention to conſider the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which might be derived from colonies, at a time when he patroniſed a ſcheme for planting them in ſome of the ruder provinces of his ancient kingdom, with a view of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing induſtry and civilization there,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. of Scotland, ii. 239.</note> was now no leſs fond of directing the active genius of his Engliſh ſubjects, towards occupations not repugnant to his own pacific maxims, and liſtened with a favourable ear to their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But as the extent as well as value of the American continent began now to be better known, a grant of the whole of ſuch a vaſt region to any one body of men, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable, appeared to him an act of impolitic and profuſe liberality. For this reaſon, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that portion of North America, which
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036237_0056_10089119D2A65678"/>
ſtretches from the thirty-fourth to the forty-fifth degree of latitude, into two diſtricts, nearly equal; the one called the firſt or ſouth colony of Virginia, the other, the ſecond or north colony. He authorized (1606, April 10) Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Summers, Richard Hakluyt, and their aſſociates, moſtly reſident in London, to ſettle any part of the former which they ſhould chooſe, and veſted in them a right of property to the land ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending along the coaſt fifty miles on each ſide of the place of their firſt habitation, and reaching into the interior country a hundred miles. The latter diſtrict he allotted, as the place of ſettlement, to ſundry knights, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and merchants of Briſtol, Plymouth, and other parts in the weſt of England, with a ſimilar grant of territory. Neither the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch who iſſued this charter, nor his ſubjects who received it, had any conception that they were proceeding to lay the foundation of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and opulent ſtates. What James granted was nothing more than a ſimple charter of corporation to a trading company, empower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the members of it to have a common ſeal, and to act as a body politic. But as the object for which they aſſociated was new, the plan eſtabliſhed for the adminiſtration of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs was uncommon. Inſtead of the power uſually granted to corporations, of electing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and framing by-laws for the conduct of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036237_0057_1008911DEE9310B0"/>
their own operations, the ſupreme govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the colonies to be ſettled, was veſted in a council reſident in England, to be named by the king, according to ſuch laws and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as ſhould be given under his ſign ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual; and the ſubordinate juriſdiction was committed to a council reſident in America, which was likewiſe to be nominated by the king, and to act conformably to his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To this important clauſe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated the form of their conſtitution, was added, the conceſſion of ſeveral immunities, to encourage perſons to ſettle in the intended colonies. Some of theſe were the ſame which had been granted to Gilbert and Ralegh; ſuch as the ſecuring to the emigrants and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants all the rights of denizens, in the ſame manner as if they had remained or had been born in England; and granting them the privilege of holding their lands in America by the freeſt and leaſt burdenſome tenure. Others were more favourable than thoſe granted by Elizabeth. He permitted whatever was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſuſtenance or commerce of the new colonies to be exported from England, during the ſpace of ſeven years, without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any duty; and as a farther incitement to induſtry, he granted them liberty of trade with other nations, and appropriated the duty to be levied on foreign commodities, for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one

            </p>
            <p>In this ſingular charter, the contents of which have been little attended to by the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians of America, ſome articles are as unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the rights of the coloniſts, as others are to the intereſt of the parent ſtate. By placing the legiſlative and executive powers in a council nominated by the crown, and guided by its inſtructions, every perſon ſettling in America, ſeems to be bereaved of the nobleſt privilege of a free man; by the unlimited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of trade with foreigners, the parent ſtate is deprived of that excluſive commerce which has been deemed the chief advantage reſulting from the eſtabliſhment of colonies. But in the infancy of colonization, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the guidance of obſervation or experience, the ideas of men with reſpect to the mode of forming new ſettlements, were not fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, or properly arranged. At a period when they could not foreſee the future gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and importance of the communities which they were about to call into exiſtence, they were ill qualified to concert the beſt plan for governing them. Beſides, the Engliſh of that age, accuſtomed to the high prerogative and arbitrary rule of their monarchs, were not
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:036237_0059_100891223B9887E0"/>
animated with ſuch liberal ſentiments, either concerning their own perſonal or political rights, as have become familiar in the more mature and improved ſtate of their conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Without heſitation or reluctance the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors of both colonies prepared to execute their reſpective plans; and under the authority of a charter, which would now be rejected with diſdain, as a violent invaſion of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and inalienable rights of liberty, the firſt permanent ſettlements of the Engliſh in America were eſtabliſhed. From this period, the progreſs of the two provinces of Virginia and New England form a regular and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected ſtory. The former in the ſouth, and the latter in the north, may be conſidered as the original and parent colonies; in imitation of which, and under whoſe ſhelter, all the others have been ſucceſſively planted and reared.</p>
            <p>The firſt attempts to occupy Virginia and New England were made by very feeble bodies of emigrants. As theſe ſettled, under great diſadvantages, among tribes of ſavages, and in an uncultivated deſert; as they attained gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, after long ſtruggles and many diſaſters, to that maturity of ſtrength, and order of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, which entitles them to be conſidered as reſpectable ſtates, the hiſtory of their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering

efforts merits particular attention. It will exhibit a ſpectacle no leſs ſtriking than inſtructive, and preſents an opportunity, which rarely occurs, of contemplating a ſociety in the firſt moment of its political exiſtence, and of obſerving how its ſpirit forms in its infant ſtate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The account of the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of the other Engliſh colonies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken at periods when the importance of ſuch poſſeſſions was better underſtood, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by more direct and vigorous exertions of the parent ſtate, is leſs intereſting. I ſhall therefore relate the hiſtory of the two original colonies in detail. With reſpect to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ſettlements, ſome more general obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations concerning the time, the motives, and circumſtances of their eſtabliſhment, will be ſufficient. I begin with the hiſtory of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, the moſt ancient and moſt valuable of the Britiſh colonies in North America.</p>
            <p>Though many perſons of diſtinction became proprietors in the company which undertook to plant a colony in Virginia, its funds ſeem not to have been conſiderable, and its firſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was certainly extremely feeble. A ſmall veſſel of a hundred tons, and two barks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Captain Newport, ſailed
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036237_0061_10088EF74F45BAA0"/>
(Dec. 19) with a hundred and five men, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to remain in the country. Some of theſe were of reſpectable families, particularly a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Earl of Northumberland, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral officers who had ſerved with reputation in the reign of Elizabeth. Newport, I know not for what reaſon, followed the ancient courſe by the Weſt Indies, and did not reach the coaſt of North America for four months (1607, April 26). But he approached it with better fortune than any former navigator; for having been driven, by the violence of a ſtorm, to the northward of Roanoke, the place of his deſtination, the firſt land he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered was a promontory which he called Cape Henry, the ſouthern boundary of the Bay of Cheſapeak. The Engliſh ſtood direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into that ſpacious inlet, which ſeemed to invite them to enter; and as they advanced, contemplated, with a mixture of delight and admiration, that grand reſervoir, into which are poured the waters of all the vaſt rivers, which not only diffuſe fertility through that diſtrict of America, but open the interior parts of the country to navigation, and render a commercial intercourſe more extenſive and commodious than in any other region of the globe. Newport, keeping along the ſouthern ſhore, ſailed up a river, which the natives call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Powhatan, and to which he gave the name of James-River. After viewing its banks,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036237_0062_10089128F7AC5990"/>
during a run of above forty miles from its mouth, they all concluded that a country, where ſafe and convenient harbours ſeemed to be numerous, would be a more ſuitable ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a trading colony, than the ſhoally and dangerous coaſt to the ſouth, on which their countrymen had formerly ſettled. Here then they determined to abide; and having choſen a proper ſpot for their reſidence, they gave this infant ſettlement the name of James-Town, which it ſtill retains; and though it has never become either populous or opulent, it can boaſt of being the moſt ancient habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Engliſh in the New World. But however well-choſen the ſituation might be, the members of the colony were far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing themſelves of its advantages. Violent animoſities had broke out among ſome of their leaders, during their voyage to Virginia. Theſe did not ſubſide on their arrival there. The firſt deed of the council, which aſſumed the government in virtue of a commiſſion brought from England under the ſeal of the company, and opened on the day after they landed, was an act of injuſtice. Captain Smith, who had been appointed a member of the council, was excluded from his ſeat at the board, by the mean jealouſy of his colleagues, and not only reduced to the condition of a private man, but of one ſuſpected and watched by his ſuperiors. This diminution of his influence, and reſtraint
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036237_0063_1008A32B558AC928"/>
on his activity, was an eſſential injury to the colony, which at that juncture ſtood in need of the aid of both. For ſoon after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſettle, the Engliſh were involved in a war with the natives, partly by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, and partly by the ſuſpicion and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity of thoſe barbarians. And although the Indians, ſcattered over the countries adjacent to James-River, were divided into independent tribes, ſo extremely feeble that hardly one of them could muſter above two hundred warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,<note n="*" place="bottom">Purchas, vol. iv. 1692. Smith's Travels, p. 23.</note> they teazed and annoyed an infant colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by their inceſſant hoſtilities. To this was added a calamity ſtill more dreadful; the ſtock of proviſions left for their ſubſiſtence, on the departure of their ſhips for England, (June 15) was ſo ſcanty, and of ſuch bad quality, that a ſcarcity, approaching almoſt to abſolute fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſoon followed. Such poor unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fare brought on diſeaſes, the violence of which was ſo much increaſed by the ſultry heat of the climate, and the moiſture of a country covered with wood, that before the beginning of September, one half of their number died, and moſt of the ſurvivors were ſickly and dejected. In ſuch trying extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the comparative powers of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual are diſcovered and called forth, and each naturally takes that ſtation, and aſſumes that
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036237_0064_1008A32E501FA3C8"/>
aſcendant, to which he is entitled by his talents and force of mind. Every eye was now turned towards Smith, and all willingly devolved on him that authority, of which they had formerly deprived him. His undaunted temper, deeply tinctured with the wild roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſpirit characteriſtic of military adventures in that age, was peculiarly ſuited to ſuch a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The vigour of his conſtitution conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, fortunately, ſtill unimpaired by diſeaſe, and his mind was never apalled by danger. He inſtantly adopted the only plan that could ſave them from deſtruction. He began by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding James-Town with ſuch rude fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as were a ſufficient defence againſt the aſſaults of ſavages. He then marched, at the head of a ſmall detachment, in queſt of their enemies. Some tribes he gained by careſſes and preſents, and procured from them a ſupply of proviſions. Others he attacked with open force; and defeating them on every occaſion, whatever their ſuperiority in numbers might be, compelled them to impart to him ſome portion of their winter ſtores. As the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of all his toils and dangers, he ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and contentment re-eſtabliſhed in the colony, and hoped that he ſhould be able to maintain them in that happy ſtate, until the arrival of ſhips from England in the ſpring: but in one of his excurſions he was ſurpriſed
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036237_0065_1008A332193B4A20"/>
by a numerous body of Indians, and in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eſcape from them, after a gallant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he ſunk to the neck in a ſwamp, and was obliged to ſurrender. Though he knew well what a dreadful fate awaits the priſoners of ſavages, his preſence of mind did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him. He ſhewed thoſe who had taken him captive a mariner's compaſs, and amuſed them with ſo many wonderful accounts of its virtues, as filled them with aſtoniſhment and veneration, which began to operate very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully in his favour. They led him, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in triumph through various parts of the country, and conducted him at laſt to Powha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the moſt conſiderable Sachim in that part of Virginia. There the doom of death being pronounced, he was led to the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his head already bowed down to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the fatal blow, when that fond attachment of the American women to their European in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, the beneficial effects of which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards often experienced, interpoſed in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. The favourite daughter of Powhatan ruſhed in between him and the executioner, and, by her intreaties and tears, prevailed on her father to ſpare his life. The beneficence of his deliverer, whom the early Engliſh wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters dignify with the title of the Princeſs Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cahuntas, did not terminate here; ſhe ſoon after procured his liberty, and ſent him

            </p>
            <p>Smith, on his return to James-Town, found the colony reduced to thirty-eight perſons, who, in deſpair, were preparing to abandon a country which did not ſeem deſtined to be the habitation of Engliſhmen. He employed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, threats, and even violence, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from executing this fatal reſolution. With difficulty he prevailed on them to defer it ſo long, that the ſuccour anxiouſly expected from England arrived. Plenty was inſtantly reſtored; a hundred new planters were added to their number, and an ample ſtock of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was requiſite for clearing and ſowing the ground was delivered to them. But an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky incident turned their attention from that ſpecies of induſtry which alone could render their ſituation comfortable. In a ſmall ſtream of water that iſſued from a bank of ſand near James-Town, a ſediment of ſome ſhining mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſubſtance, which had ſome reſemblance of gold, was diſcovered. At a time when the precious metals were conceived to be the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and only valuable productions of the New World, when every mountain was ſuppoſed to contain a treaſure, and every rivulet was ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for its golden ſands, this appearance was
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:036237_0067_1008A33D18F59A48"/>
fondly conſidered as an infallible indication of a mine. Every hand was eager to dig; large quantities of this glittering duſt were amaſſed. From ſome aſſay of its nature, made by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt as unſkilful as his companions were credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, it was pronounced to be extremely rich. "There was now," (ſays Smith) <q>no talk, no hope, no work, but dig gold, waſh gold, refine gold.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Smith's Travels, p. 53.</note> With this imaginary wealth the firſt veſſel returning to England was load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while the culture of the land, and every uſeful occupation, was totally neglected.</p>
            <p>The effects of this fatal deluſion were ſoon felt. Notwithſtanding all the provident acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Smith, in procuring corn from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives by traffic or by force, the colony began to ſuffer as much as formerly from ſcarcity of food, and was waſted by the ſame diſtempers. In hopes of obtaining ſome relief, Smith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as they had not hitherto extended their reſearches beyond the countries contiguous to James-River, to open an intercourſe with the more remote tribes, and to examine into the ſtate of culture and population among them. The execution of this arduous deſign he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook himſelf, in a ſmall open boat, with a feeble crew, and a very ſcanty ſtock of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. He began his ſurvey at Cape Charles,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:036237_0068_1008A3408042B238"/>
and in two different excurſions, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued above four months, he advanced as far as the river Suſquehannah, which flows into the bottom of the Bay. He viſited all the countries both on the eaſt and weſt ſhores; he entered moſt of the conſiderable creeks; he ſailed up many of the great rivers as far as their falls. He traded with ſome tribes; he fought with others; he obſerved the nature of the territory which they occupied, their mode of ſubſiſtence, the peculiarities in their manners; and left among all a wonderful admiration ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the beneficence or valour of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. After ſailing above three thouſand miles in a paltry veſſel, ill fitted for ſuch an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive navigation, during which the hardſhips to which he was expoſed, as well as the patience with which he endured, and the fortitude with which he ſurmounted them, equal whatever is related of the celebrated Spaniſh diſcoverers in their moſt daring enterprizes; he returned to James-Town; he brought with him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that large portion of the American continent now comprehended in the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Virginia and Maryland,<note n="*" place="bottom">Smith's Travels, p. 65, &amp;c.</note> ſo full and exact, that after the progreſs of information and reſearch for a century and a half, his map exhibits no inaccurate view of both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and is the original upon which all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent

            <p>But, whatever pleaſing proſpect of future benefit might open upon this complete diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a country, formed by nature to be the feat of an excluſive commerce, it afforded but little relief for their preſent wants. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony ſtill depended for ſubſiſtence chiefly on ſupplies from the natives; as, after all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of their own induſtry, hardly thirty acres of ground were yet cleared ſo as to be capable of culture.<note n="†" place="bottom">Stith, p. 97.</note> By Smith's attention, however, the ſtores of the Engliſh were ſo regularly filled, that for ſome time they felt no conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtreſs; and at this juncture a change was made in the conſtitution of the company, which ſeemed to promiſe an increaſe of their ſecurity and happineſs. That ſupreme direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the company's operations, which the king by his charter had reſerved to himſelf, diſcouraged perſons of rank or property from becoming members of a ſociety ſo dependant on the arbitrary will of the crown. Upon a repreſentation of this to James, (1609, May 23) he granted them a new charter, with more ample privileges. He enlarged the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of the colony; he rendered the powers of the company, as a corporation, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:036237_0070_1008A3441F08F628"/>
and complete; he aboliſhed the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the council reſident in Virginia; he veſted the government entirely in a council reſiding in London; he granted to the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors of the company the right of electing the perſons who were to compoſe this council, by a majority of voices; he authorized this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to eſtabliſh ſuch laws, orders, and forms of government and magiſtracy, for the colony and plantation, as they in their diſcretion ſhould think to be fitteſt for the good of the adventurers and inhabitants there; he empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered them to nominate a governor to have the adminiſtration of affairs in the colony, and to carry their orders into execution.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith. Append. 8.</note> In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe conceſſions, the company hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquired the power of regulating all its own tranſactions, the number of proprietors increaſed, and among them we find the moſt reſpectable names in the nation.</p>
            <p>The firſt deed of the new council was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Lord Delaware governor and captain-general of their colony in Virginia. To a perſon of his rank, thoſe high-ſounding titles could be no allurement; and by his thorough acquaintance with the progreſs and ſtate of the ſettlement, he knew enough of the labour and difficulty with which an infant colony is rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:036237_0071_1008A34927E7D200"/>
to expect any thing but anxiety and care in diſcharging the duties of that delicate office. But from zeal to promote an eſtabliſhment which he expected to prove ſo highly beneficial to his country, he was willing to relinquiſh all the comforts of an honourable ſtation, to undertake a long voyage to ſettle in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated region, deſtitute of every accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to which he had been accuſtomed, and where he foreſaw that toil and trouble and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger awaited him. But as he could not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately leave England, the council diſpatched Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Summers, the former of whom had been appointed lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-general, and the latter admiral, with nine ſhips and five hundred planters. They carried with them commiſſions, by which they were empowered to ſuperſede the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former council, to proclaim Lord Delaware governor, and, until he ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, to take the adminiſtration of affairs into their own hands. A violent hurricane ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the veſſel in which Gates and Summers had embarked, from the reſt of the fleet, and ſtranded it on the coaſt of Bermudas. The other ſhips arrived (Auguſt 11) ſafely at James-Town. But the fate of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders was unknown. Their commiſſion for new-modelling the government, and all other public papers, were ſuppoſed to be loſt, together with them. The preſent form of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:036237_0072_1008A34B7023C6B8"/>
government, however, was held to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. No legal warrant could be produced for eſtabliſhing any other. Smith was not in a condition at this juncture to aſſert his own rights, or to act with his wonted vigour. By an accidental exploſion of gunpowder, he had been ſo miſerably ſcorched and mangled, that he was incapable of moving, and under the neceſſity of committing himſelf to the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his friends, who carried him aboard one of the ſhips returning to England, in hopes that he might recover by more ſkilful treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than he could meet with in Virginia.<note n="*" place="bottom">Purchas, iv. 1734, &amp;c.

            <p>After his departure, every thing tended faſt to the wildeſt anarchy. Faction and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent had often riſen ſo high among the old ſettlers, that they could hardly be kept within bounds. The ſpirit of the new-comers was too ungovernable to bear any reſtraint. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral among them of better rank were ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated hopeleſs young men, as their friends were glad to ſend out in queſt of whatever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune might betide them in a foreign land. Of the lower order, many were ſo profligate or deſperate, that their country was happy to throw them out as nuiſances in ſociety. Such perſons were little capable of the regular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, the ſtrict oeconomy, and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

induſtry, which their ſituation required. The Indians obſerving their miſconduct, and that every precaution for ſuſtenance or ſafety was neglected, not only withheld the ſupplies of proviſions which they were accuſtomed to furniſh, but haraſſed them with continual hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities. All their ſubſiſtence was derived from the ſtores which they had brought from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; theſe were ſoon conſumed; then the domeſtic animals ſent out to breed in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were devou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In leſs than ſix months, of five hundred perſons whom Smith left in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, only ſixty remained; and theſe ſo feeble and dejected, that they could not have ſurvived for ten days, if ſuccour had not arrived from a quarter whence they did not expect it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, p. 116.

            <p>When Gates and Summers were thrown aſhore on Bermudas, fortunately not a ſingle perſon on board their ſhip periſhed. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of their proviſions and ſtores too was ſaved, and in that delightful ſpot, Nature,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:036237_0074_1008A34F952164B0"/>
with ſpontaneous bounty, preſented to them ſuch a variety of her productions, that a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty people ſubſiſted in affluence for ten months on an uninhabited iſland. Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, however, to eſcape from a place where they were cut off from all intercourſe with mankind, they ſet about building two barks with ſuch tools and materials as they had, and by amazing efforts of perſeverance and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity they finiſhed them. In theſe they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, and ſteered directly towards Virginia, in hopes of finding an ample conſolation for all their toils and dangers in the embraces of their companions, and amidſt the comforts of a flouriſhing colony. After a more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous navigation than they could have expected in their ill-conſtructed veſſels, they landed (May 23) at James-Town. But inſtead of that joyful interview for which they fondly looked, a ſpectacle preſented itſelf which ſtruck them with horror. They beheld the miſerable remainder of their countrymen ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated with famine and ſickneſs, ſunk in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and in their figure and looks rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling ſpectres than human beings. As Gates and Summers, in full confidence of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plenty of proviſions in Virginia, had brought with them no larger ſtock than was deemed neceſſary for their own ſupport during the voyage, their inability to afford relief to their countrymen, added to the anguiſh with which
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:036237_0075_1008A351F14FF278"/>
they viewed this unexpected ſcene of diſtreſs. Nothing now remained but inſtantly to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a country, where it was impoſſible to ſubſiſt any longer; and though all that could be found in the ſtores of the colony, when added to what remained of the ſtock brought from Bermudas, did not amount to more than was ſufficient to ſupport them for ſixteen days, at the moſt ſcanty allowance, they ſet ſail, in hopes of being able to reach Newfoundland, where they expected to be relieved by their countrymen, employed at that ſeaſon in the fiſhery there.<note n="*" place="bottom">A minute and curious account of the ſhipwreck of Gates and Summers, and of their adventures in Bermudas, was compoſed by Strachy, a gentleman who accompanied them, and was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Purchas, iv. 1734.</note>

            <p>But it was not the will of Heaven that all the labour of the Engliſh, in planting this colony, as well as all their hopes of benefit from its future poſterity, ſhould be forever loſt. Before Gates, and the melancholy companions of his voyage, had reached the mouth of James-River, they were met by Lord Delaware, with three ſhips, that brought a large recruit of proviſions, a conſiderable number of new ſettlers, and every thing requiſite for defence or cultivation. By perſuaſion and authority he prevailed on them to return to James-Town, where they found their fort, their magazines,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036237_0076_1008A355F50B8760"/>
and houſes entire, which Sir Thomas Gates, by ſome happy chance, had preſerved from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on fire at the time of their departure. A ſociety ſo feeble and diſordered in its frame required a tender and ſkilful hand to cheriſh it, and reſtore its vigour. This it found in Lord Delaware; he ſearched into the cauſes of their misfortunes, as far as he could diſcover them, amidſt the violence of their mutual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations; but inſtead of exerting his power in puniſhing crimes that were paſt, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his prudence in healing their diſſenſions, and in guarding againſt a repetition of the fame fatal errors. By unwearied aſſiduity, by the reſpect due to an amiable and beneficent character, by knowing how to mingle ſeverity with indulgence, and when to aſſume the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his office, as well as when to diſplay the gentleneſs natural to his own temper, he gradually reconciled men corrupted by anarchy to ſubordination and diſcipline, he turned the attention of the idle and profligate to induſtry, and taught the Indians again to reverence and dread the Engliſh name (1611, March 28). Under ſuch an adminiſtration, the colony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan once more to aſſume a promiſing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; when unhappily for it, a complication of diſeaſes brought on by the climate obliged Lord Delaware to quit the country;<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, p. 117.

               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:036237_0077_1008A35890245300"/>He was ſoon ſuperſeded (May 10) by the arrival of Sir Thomas Dale; in whom the company had veſted more abſolute authority than in any of his predeceſſors, impowering him to rule by martial law; a ſhort code of which, founded on the practice of the armies in the Low Countries, the moſt rigid military ſchool at that time in Europe, they ſent out with him. This ſyſtem of government is ſo violent and arbitrary, that even the Spaniards themſelves had not ventured to introduce it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſettlements; for among them, as ſoon as a plantation began, and the arts of peace ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the operations of war, the juriſdiction of the civil magiſtrate was uniformly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. But however unconſtitutional or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive this may appear, it was adopted by the advice of Sir Francis Bacon, the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened philoſopher, and one of the moſt eminent lawyers of the age.<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon, Eſſay on Plantations, p. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Happily for the colony, Sir Thomas Dale, who was entruſted with this dangerous power, exerciſed it with prudence and moderation. By the vigour

which the ſummary mode of military pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment gave to his adminiſtration, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the colony more perfect order than had ever been eſtabliſhed there; and at the ſame time he tempered its vigour with ſo much diſcretion, that no alarm ſeems to have been given by this formidable innovation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, p. 122.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The regular form which the colony now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to aſſume, (1612, March 12) induced the King to iſſue a new charter for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the adventurers, by which he not only confirmed all their former privileges, and prolonged the term of exemption from payment of duties on the commodities export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, but granted them more extenſive property, as well as more ample juriſdiction. All the iſlands lying within three hundred leagues of the coaſt were annexed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Virginia. In conſequence of this, the company took poſſeſſion of Bermudas, and the other ſmall iſles diſcovered by Gates and Summers; and at the ſame time prepared to ſend out a conſiderable reinforcement to the colony at James-Town. The expence of thoſe extraordinary efforts was defrayed by the profits of a lottery, which amounted nearly to thirty thouſand pounds. This expedient, they were authorized to employ by their

But the Houſe of Commons, which towards the cloſe of this reign began to obſerve every meaſure of government with jealous attention, having remonſtrated againſt the inſtitution as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional and impolitic, James recalled the licence under the ſanction of which it had been eſtabliſhed.<note n="†" place="bottom">Chalmers' Annals, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By the ſevere diſcipline of martial law, the activity of the coloniſts was forced into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per direction, and exerted itſelf in uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. This, aided by a fertile ſoil and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable climate, ſoon enabled them to raiſe ſuch a large ſtock of proviſions, that they were no longer obliged to truſt for ſubſiſtence to the precarious ſupplies which they obtained or extorted from the Indians. In proportion as the Engliſh became more independent, the natives courted their friendſhip upon more equal terms. The happy effects of this were quickly felt.

Pocahuntas, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite daughter of the great Chief Powhatan, to whoſe interceſſion Captain Smith was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for his life, perſevered in her partial at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Engliſh; and as ſhe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſited their ſettlements, where ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways received with reſpectful hoſpitality, her admiration of their arts and manners continued to increaſe. During this intercourſe, her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is repreſented as far ſuperior to that of her countrywomen, made ſuch impreſſion on the heart of Mr. Rolfe, a young man of rank in the colony, that he warmly ſolicited her to accept of him as a huſband. Where manners are ſimple, courtſhip is not tedious. Neither artifice prevents, nor ceremony forbids the heart from declaring its ſentiments. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cahuntas readily gave her conſent; Dale encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the alliance, and Powhatan did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve it. The marriage was celebrated with extraordinary pomp; and from that period a

friendly correſpondence ſubſiſted between the colony and all the tribes ſubject to Powhatan, or that ſtood in awe of his power. Rolfe and his Princeſs, (for by that name the writers of the laſt age always diſtinguiſhed her) ſet out for England, where ſhe was received by James and his Queen with the reſpect ſuited to her birth. Being carefully inſtructed in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Chriſtian faith, ſhe was publicly baptized, but died a few years after, on her return to America, leaving one ſon; from whom are ſprung ſome of the moſt reſpectable families in Virginia, who boaſt of their deſcent from the race of the ancient rulers of their country.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hamer Solida Narratio, ap. de Bry, Pars x. p. 23.

with the native Americans. The Indians, courting ſuch an union, offered their daughters in marriage to their new gueſts; and when they did not accept of the proffered alliance, they naturally imputed it to pride and to their contempt of them as an inferior order of beings.<note n="*" place="bottom">Beverley's Hiſt. of Virg. p. 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>During the interval of tranquillity procured by the alliance with Powhatan, an important change was made in the ſtate of the colony. Hitherto no right of private property in land had been eſtabliſhed. The fields that were cleared had been cultivated by the joint labour of the coloniſts; their product was carried to the common ſtore-houſes, and diſtributed weekly to every family, according to its num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and exigencies. A ſociety, deſtitute of the firſt advantage reſulting from ſocial union, was not formed to proſper. Induſtry, when not excited by the idea of property in what was acquired by its own efforts, made no vigorous exertion. The head had no inducement to contrive, nor the hand to labour. The idle and improvident truſted entirely to what was iſſued from the common ſtore; the aſſiduity even of the ſober and attentive relaxed, when they perceived that others were to reap the fruit of their toil; and it was computed, that
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:036237_0083_1008A338CAC95E28"/>
the united induſtry of the colony did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh as much work in a week as might have been performed in a day, if each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual had laboured on his own account. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to remedy this, Sir Thomas Dale divided a conſiderable portion of the land into ſmall lots, and granted one of theſe to each individual in full property. From the moment that induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had the certain proſpect of a recompence, it advanced with rapid progreſs. The articles of primary neceſſity were cultivated with ſo much attention as ſecured the means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; and ſuch ſchemes of improvement were formed as prepared the way for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of opulence into the colony.<note n="*" place="bottom">Smith's Travels, p. 114. Stith, p. 131.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The induſtrious ſpirit, which began to riſe among the planters, was ſoon directed towards a new object; and they applied to it for ſome time with ſuch inconſiderate ardour as was productive of fatal conſequences. The cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of tobacco, which has ſince become the ſtaple of Virginia, and the ſource of its proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, was introduced about this time (1616) into the colony. As the taſte for that weed continued to increaſe in England, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the zealous declamations of James againſt it, the tobacco imported from Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia came to a ready market; and though it
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:036237_0084_1008A336E072E280"/>
was ſo much inferior in quality or in eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that raiſed by the Spaniards in the Weſt Indian iſlands, that a pound of the latter ſold for eighteen ſhillings, and of the former for no more than three ſhillings, it yielded a conſiderable profit. Allured by the proſpect of ſuch a certain and quick return, every other ſpecies of induſtry was neglected. The land which ought to have been reſerved for raiſing proviſions, and even the ſtreets of James-Town, were planted with tobacco. Various regulations were framed to reſtrain this ill-directed activity. But from eagerneſs for preſent gain, the planters diſregarded every admonition. The means of ſubſiſtence became ſo ſcanty as forced them to renew their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon the Indians, who, ſeeing no end of thoſe exactions, their antipathy to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh name revived with additional rancour, and they began to form ſchemes of vengeance, with the ſecrecy and ſilence peculiar to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, p. 140. 147. 164. 168.

            <p>Meanwhile the colony, notwithſtanding this error in its operations, and the cloud that was gathering over its head, continued to wear an aſpect of proſperity. Its numbers increaſed by ſucceſſive migrations; the quantity of tobacco exported became every year more conſiderable,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:036237_0085_1008A368DA06C010"/>
and ſeveral of the planters were not only in an eaſy ſituation, but advancing faſt to opulence;<note n="*" place="bottom">Smith, p. 139.</note> and by two events, which happened nearly at the ſame time, both population and induſtry were greatly promoted. As few women had hitherto ventured to encounter the hardſhips which were unavoidable in an unknown and uncultivated country, moſt of the coloniſts, conſtrained to live ſingle, conſidered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as no more than ſojourners in a land to which they were not attached by the tender ties of a family and children. In order to induce them to ſettle there, the company took advantage of the apparent tranquillity in the country, to ſend out a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of young women, of humble birth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but of unexceptionable character, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the planters, by premiums and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, to marry them.<note n="†" place="bottom">Stith, p. 166. 197</note> Theſe new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were received with ſuch fondneſs, and many of them ſo comfortably eſtabliſhed, as invited others to follow their example, and by degrees thoughtleſs adventurers, aſſuming the ſentiments of virtuous citizens and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident fathers of families, became ſolicitous about the proſperity of a country, which they now conſidered as their own. As the coloniſts began to form more extenſive plans of induſtry, they were unexpectedly furniſhed with means
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:036237_0086_1008A36B55065300"/>
of executing them with greater facility. A Dutch ſhip from the Coaſt of Guinea, having ſailed up James-River, ſold a part of her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go of negroes to the planters;<note n="*" place="bottom">Beverley, p. 37.</note> and as that hardy race was found more capable of endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fatigue under a ſultry climate than Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, their number has been increaſed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual importation; their aid ſeems now to be eſſential to the exiſtence of the colony, and the greater part of field labour in Virginia is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſervile hands.</p>
            <p>But as the condition of the colony improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſpirit of its members became more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent. To Engliſhmen the ſummary and ſevere deciſions of martial law, however tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by the mildneſs of their governors, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared intolerably oppreſſive; and they longed to recover the privileges to which they had been accuſtomed under the liberal form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in their native country. In compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with this ſpirit, Sir George Yeardley, in the year 1619, called the firſt general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that was ever held in Virginia; and the numbers of the people were now ſo increaſed, and their ſettlements ſo diſperſed, that eleven corporations appeared by their repreſentatives in this convention, where they were permitted to aſſume legiſlative power, and to exerciſe the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:036237_0087_1008A36CE76BACC0"/>
nobleſt function of free men. The laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in it ſeem neither to have been many, nor of great importance; but the meeting was highly acceptable to the people, as they now beheld among themſelves an image of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh conſtitution, which they reverenced as the moſt perfect model of free government. In order to render this reſemblance more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and the rights of the planters more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the company iſſued a charter (July 24) or ordinance, which gave a legal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent form to the government of the colony. The ſupreme legiſlative authority in Virginia, in imitation of that in Great Britain, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and lodged partly in the governor, who held the place of the ſovereign; partly in a council of ſtate named by the company, which poſſeſſed ſome of the diſtinctions, and exerciſed ſome of the functions belonging to the peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; partly in a general council or aſſembly compoſed of the repreſentatives of the people, in which were veſted powers and privileges ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to thoſe of the Houſe of Commons. be both theſe councils all queſtions were to In determined by the majority of voices, and a negative was reſerved to the governor; but no law or ordinance, though approved of by all the three members of the legiſlature, was to be of force, until it was ratified in England by a general court of the company, and returned
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:036237_0088_1008A36FCDE80B18"/>
under its ſeal.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, Appendix, p. 32, &amp;c.</note> Thus the conſtitution of the colony was fixed, and the members of it are henceforth to be conſidered, not merely as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of a commercial company, dependant on the will and orders of their ſuperior, but as free men and citizens.</p>
            <p>The natural effect of that happy change in their condition was an increaſe of their induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The product of tobacco in Virginia was now equal, not only to the conſumption of it in Great Britain,<note n="†" place="bottom">It is a matter of ſome curioſity to trace the progreſs of the conſumption of this unneceſſary commodity. The uſe of tobacco ſeems to have been firſt introduced into England about the year 1586. Poſſibly a few ſea-faring perſons may have acquired a reliſh for it by their intercourſe with the Spaniards previous to that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od; but the uſe of it cannot be denominated a national habit ſooner than the time I have mentioned. Upon an average of the ſeven years immediately preceding the year 1622, the whole import of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco into England amounted to a hundred and forty-two thouſand and eighty-five pounds weight. Stith, p. 246. From this it appears, that the taſte had ſpread with a rapidity which is remarkable. But how inconſiderable is that quantity to what is now conſumed in Great Britain!</note> but could furniſh ſome quantity for a foreign market. The company opened a trade for it with Holland, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed warehouſes in Middleburgh and Fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. James, and his privy council, alarmed at ſeeing the commerce of a commodity, for which the demand was daily increaſing, turned into a channel that tended to the diminution of the revenue, by depriving it of a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able duty impoſed on the importation of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,

interpoſed with vigour to check this innovation. Some expedient was found, by which the matter was adjuſted for the preſent; but it is remarkable as the firſt inſtance of a difference in ſentiment between the parent ſtate and the colony, concerning their reſpective rights. The former concluded, that the trade of the colony ſhould be confined to England, and all its productions be landed there. The latter claimed, not only the general privilege of Engliſhmen, to carry their commodities to the beſt market, but pleaded the particular conceſſions in their charter, by which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited freedom of commerce ſeemed to be granted to them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, p. 200, &amp;c.</note> The time for a more full diſcuſſion of this important queſtion was not yet arrived.</p>
            <p>But while the colony continued to increaſe ſo faſt, that ſettlements were ſcattered, not only along the banks of James and York Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, but began to extend to the Rapahan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock, and even to the Potowmack, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, relying on their own numbers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by this appearance of proſperity, lived in full ſecurity. They neither attended to the movements of the Indians, nor ſuſpected their machinations, and though ſurrounded by a people whom they might have known from experience
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:036237_0090_1008A3769F95E830"/>
to be both artful and vindictive, they neglected every precaution for their own ſafety that was requiſite in ſuch a ſituation. Like the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inhabitants of a ſociety completely eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were no longer ſoldiers but citizens, and were ſo intent on what was ſubſervient to the comfort or embelliſhment of civil life, that every martial exerciſe began to be laid aſide as unneceſſary. The Indians, whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly employed as hunters, were furniſhed with fire-arms, and taught to uſe them with dexterity. They were permitted to frequent the habitations of the Engliſh at all hours, and received as innocent viſitants whom there was no reaſon to dread. This inconſiderate ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enabled the Indians to prepare for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of that plan of vengeance, which they meditated with all the deliberate forethought which is agreeable to their temper. Nor did they want a leader capable of conducting their ſchemes with addreſs. On the death of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatan, in the year 1618, Opechancanough ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, not only as wirowanee or chief of his own tribe, but in that extenſive influence over all the Indian nations of Virginia, which induced the Engliſh writers to diſtinguiſh them by the name of Emperor. According to the Indian tradition, he was not a native of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, but came from a diſtant country to the ſouth-weſt, poſſibly from ſome province of
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:036237_0091_1008A3783479A3B8"/>
the Mexican Empire.<note n="*" place="bottom">Beverley, p. 51.</note> But as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous for all the qualities of higheſt eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among ſavages, a fearleſs courage, great ſtrength and agility of body, and crafty poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he quickly roſe to eminence and power. Soon after his elevation to the ſupreme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, a general maſſacre of the Engliſh ſeems to have been reſolved upon; and during four years, the means of perpetrating it with the greateſt facility and ſucceſs were concerted with amazing ſecrecy. All the tribes contiguous to the Engliſh ſettlements were ſucceſſively gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except thoſe on the Eaſtern ſhore, from whom, on account of their peculiar attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their new neighbours, every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that might diſcover what they intended was carefully concealed. To each tribe its ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was allotted, and the part it was to act preſcribed. On the morning of the day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to vengeance, (March 22) each was at the place of rendezvous appointed, while the Engliſh were ſo little aware of the impending deſtruction, that they received with unſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hoſpitality, ſeveral perſons ſent by Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancanough, under pretext of delivering pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of veniſon and fruits, but in reality to obſerve their motions. Finding them perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure, at mid-day, the moment that was previouſly fixed for this deed of horror, the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:036237_0092_1008A379D333FC30"/>
Indians ruſhed at once upon them in all their different ſettlements, and murdered men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, with undiſtinguiſhing rage, and that rancorous cruelty with which ſavages treat their enemies. In one hour, nearly a fourth part of the whole colony was cut off, almoſt without knowing by whoſe hands they fell. The ſlaughter would have been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, if compaſſion, or a ſenſe of duty, had not moved a converted Indian, to whom the ſecret was communicated the night before the maſſacre, to reveal it to his maſter in ſuch time as to ſave James-Town, and ſome adjacent ſettlements; and if the Engliſh, in other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, had not run to their arms with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prompted by deſpair, and defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo bravely as to repulſe their aſſailants, who, in the execution of their plan, did not diſcover courage equal to the ſagacity and art with which they had concerted it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, p. 208, &amp;c.

            <p>But though the blow was thus prevented from deſcending with its full effect, it proved very grievous to an infant colony. In ſome ſettlements not a ſingle Engliſhman eſcaped. Many perſons of prime note in the colony, and among theſe ſeveral members of the council, were ſlain. The ſurvivors, overwhelmed with grief, aſtoniſhment, and terror, abandoned all
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:036237_0093_1008A37E35FE5788"/>
their remote ſettlements, and, crowding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for ſafety to James-Town, did not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy a territory of greater extent than had been planted ſoon after the arrival of their countrymen in Virginia. Confined within thoſe narrow boundaries, they were leſs intent on ſchemes of induſtry than on thoughts of revenge. Every man took arms. A bloody war againſt the Indians commenced; and, bent on exterminating the whole race, neither old nor young were ſpared. The conduct of the Spaniards in the Southern regions of America was openly propoſed as the moſt proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del to imitate;<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, p. 233.</note> and, regardleſs like them of thoſe principles of faith, honour, and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which regulate hoſtility among civilized nations, and ſet bounds to its rage, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh deemed every thing allowable that tended to accompliſh their deſigns.

               </gap>ted the Indians like wild beaſts, rather than enemies; and as the purſuit of them to their places of retreat in the woods, which covered their country, was both difficult and dangerous, they endeavoured to allure them from their inacceſſible faſtneſſes, by offers of peace and promiſes of oblivion, made with ſuch an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appearance of ſincerity as deceived their crafty leader, and induced them (1623) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their former ſettlements, and reſume
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:036237_0094_1008A380A09BB3B8"/>
their uſual peaceful occupations. The beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the two people ſeemed now to be perfectly reverſed. The Indians, like men acquainted with the principles of integrity and good faith, on which the intercourſe between nations is founded, confided in the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lived in abſolute ſecurity without ſuſpicion of danger; while the Engliſh, with perfidious craft, were preparing to imitate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages in their revenge and cruelty. On the approach of harveſt, when they knew an hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile attack would be moſt formidable and fatal, they fell ſuddenly upon all the Indian planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, murdered every perſon on whom they could lay hold, and drove the reſt to the woods, where ſo many periſhed with hunger, that ſome of the tribes neareſt to the Engliſh were totally extirpated. This atrocious deed, which the perpetrators laboured to repreſent as a neceſſary act of retaliation, was followed by ſome happy effects. It delivered the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſo entirely from any dread of the Indians, that its ſettlements began again to extend, and its induſtry to revive.</p>
            <p>But unfortunately at this juncture the ſtate of the company in England, in which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Virginia and the government of the colony ſettled there were veſted, prevented it from ſeconding the efforts of the planters, by ſuch a reinforcement of men, and ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

of neceſſaries, as were requiſite to replace what they had loſt. The company was origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally compoſed of many adventurers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſo faſt by the junction of new members, allured by the proſpect of gain, or the deſire of promoting a ſcheme of public utility, that its general courts formed a numerous aſſembly.<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, p. 272. 276.</note> The operation of every political principle and paſſion, that ſpread through the kingdom, was felt in thoſe popular meetings, and influenced their deciſions. As towards the cloſe of James's reign more juſt and enlarged ſentiments with reſpect to conſtitutional liberty were diffuſed among the people, they came to underſtand their rights better, and to aſſert them with greater boldneſs; a diſtinction formerly little known, but now familiar in Engliſh policy, began to be eſtabliſhed between the court and country parties, and the leaders of each endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to derive power and conſequence from every quarter. Both exerted themſelves with emulation, in order to obtain the direction of a body ſo numerous and reſpectable as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Virginian adventurers. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, buſineſs had been conducted in every general court for ſome years, not with the temperate ſpirit of merchants delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating concerning their mutual intereſt, but with the animoſity and violence natural to nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous

            </p>
            <p>As the king did not often aſſemble the great council of the nation in parliament, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral courts of the company became a theatre, on which popular orators diſplayed their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; the proclamations of the crown, and acts of the privy council, with reſpect to the commerce and police of the colony, were can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed there with freedom, and cenſured with ſeverity, ill-ſuited to the lofty ideas which James entertained of his own wiſdom, and the extent of his prerogative. In order to check this growing ſpirit of diſcuſſion, the miniſters employed all their addreſs and influence to gain as many members of the company as might give them the direction of their deliberations. But ſo unſucceſsful were they in this attempt, that every meaſure propoſed by them was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated by a vaſt majority, and ſometimes without any reaſon, but becauſe they were the propoſers of it. James, little favourable to the power of any popular aſſembly, and weary of contending with one over which he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vain to obtain an aſcendant, began to entertain thoughts of diſſolving the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and of new-modelling its conſtitution. Pretexts, neither unplauſible, nor deſtitute of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:036237_0097_1008A47F5830D730"/>
ſome foundation, ſeemed to juſtify this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The ſlow progreſs of the colony, the large ſums of money expended, and great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men who had periſhed in attempting to plant it, the late maſſacre by the Indians, and every diſaſter that had befallen the Engliſh from their firſt migration to America, were imputed ſolely to the inability of a numerous company to conduct an enterpriſe ſo complex and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous. The nation felt ſenſibly its diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in a ſcheme in which it had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with ſanguine expectations of advantage, and wiſhed impatiently for ſuch an impartial ſcrutiny into former proceedings, as might ſuggeſt more ſalutary meaſures in the future adminiſtration of the colony. The preſent ſtate of its affairs, as well as the wiſhes of the people, ſeemed to call for the interpoſition of the crown; and James, eager to diſplay the ſuperiority of his royal wiſdom, in correcting thoſe errors into which the company had been betrayed by inexperience in the arts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, boldly undertook the work of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Without regarding the rights conveyed to the company by their charter, and without the formality of any judicial proceeding for annulling it, he, by virtue of his prerogative, iſſued a commiſſion, (1623, May 9) empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering ſome of the judges, and other perſons of note, to examine into all the tranſactions of the company from its firſt eſtabliſhment, and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:036237_0098_10088F01163F9E20"/>
to lay the reſult of their inquiries, together with their opinion concerning the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual means of rendering the colony more proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous,<note n="*" place="bottom">Stith, p. 288.</note> before the privy council. At the ſame time, by a ſtrain of authority ſtill higher, he ordered all the records and papers of the company to be ſeized, and two of its principal officers to be arreſted. Violent and arbitrary as theſe acts of authority may now appear, the commiſſioners carried on their inquiry without any obſtruction but what aroſe from ſome fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ineffectual remonſtrances of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The commiſſioners, though they conducted their ſcrutiny with much activity and vigour,<note n="†" place="bottom">Smith's Travels, p. 165, &amp;c.</note> did not communicate any of their proceedings to the company; but their report, with reſpect to its operations, ſeems to have been very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable, as the king, in conſequence of it, (October 8) ſignified to the company, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of veſting the ſupreme government of the company in a governor and twelve aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, to be reſident in England, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power in a council of twelve, which ſhould reſide in Virginia. The governor and aſſiſtants were to be originally appointed by the king. Future vacancies were to be ſupplied by the governor and his aſſiſtants, but their nomination was not to take effect until it ſhould be ratified by the privy council. The twelve
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:036237_0099_1008A3882BC3B858"/>
counſellors in Virginia were to be choſen by the governor and aſſiſtants; and this choice was likewiſe ſubjected to the review of the privy council. With an inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But here James and his miniſters encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſpirit, of which they ſeem not to have been aware.

Neither promiſes nor threats could induce them to depart from theſe ſentiments; and in a general court (October 20) the king's propoſal was almoſt unanimouſly rejected, and
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:036237_0100_1008A389C7F1D810"/>
a reſolution taken to defend to the utmoſt their chartered rights, if theſe ſhould be called in queſtion in any court of juſtice. James, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended at their preſumption in daring to oppoſe his will, directed a writ (Nov. 10) of <hi>quo warranto</hi> to be iſſued againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that the validity of its charter might be tried in the Court of King's Bench; and in order to aggravate the charge by collecting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional proofs of mal-adminiſtration, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſome perſons, in whom he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, to repair to Virginia to inſpect the ſtate of the colony, and inquire into the conduct of the company, and of its officers there.</p>
            <p>The law-ſuit in the King's Bench did not hang long in ſuſpenſe. It terminated, as was uſual in that reign, in a deciſion perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the wiſhes of the monarch.

            <p>Some writers, particularly Stith, the moſt intelligent and beſt informed hiſtorian of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, mention the diſſolution of the company as a moſt diſaſtrous event to the colony. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with liberal ſentiments, imbibed in an

age when the principles of liberty were more fully unfolded than under the reign of James, they viewed his violent and arbitrary proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on this occaſion with ſuch indignation, that their abhorrence of the means which he employed to accompliſh his deſign, ſeems to have rendered them incapable of contemplating its effects with diſcernment and candour. There is not perhaps any mode of governing an infant colony leſs friendly to its liberty, than the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of an excluſive corporation, poſſeſſed of all the powers which James had conferred upon the company of adventurers in Virginia. During ſeveral years the coloniſts can hardly be conſidered in any other light than as ſervants to the company, nouriſhed out of its ſtores, bound implicitly to obey its orders, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the moſt rigorous of all forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that of martial law. Even after the native ſpirit of Engliſhmen began to rouſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der oppreſſion, and had extorted from their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors the right of enacting laws for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that community of which they were members, as no act, though approved of by all the branches of the provincial legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was held to be of legal force, until it was ratified by a general court in England, the company ſtill retained the paramount au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in its own hands. Nor was the power of the company more favourable to the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the colony, than to its freedom. A

numerous body of merchants, as long as its operations are purely commercial, may carry them on with diſcernment and ſucceſs. But the mercantile ſpirit ſeems ill adapted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct an enlarged and liberal plan of civil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and colonies have ſeldom grown up to maturity and vigour under its narrow and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted regulations. To the unavoidable defects in adminiſtration which this occaſioned, were added errors ariſing from inexperience. The Engliſh merchants of that age had not thoſe extenſive views which a general commerce opens to ſuch as have the direction of it. When they firſt began to venture out of the beaten track, they groped their way with timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and heſitation. Unacquainted with the climate and ſoil of America, and ignorant of the productions beſt ſuited to them, they ſeem to have had no ſettled plan of improvement, and their ſchemes were continually varying. Their ſyſtem of government was equally fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating. In the courſe of eighteen years ten different perſons preſided over the province as chief governors. No wonder that under ſuch adminiſtration all the efforts to give vigour and ſtability to the colony ſhould prove abortive, or produce only ſlender effects. Theſe efforts, however, when eſtimated according to the ideas of that age, either with reſpect to commerce or to policy, were very conſiderable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with aſtoniſhing perſeverance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:036237_0103_1008A391A78F3668"/>Above an hundred and fifty thouſand pounds were expended in this firſt attempt to plant an Engliſh colony in America;<note n="*" place="bottom">Smith's Travels, p. 42. 167.</note> and more than nine thouſand perſons were ſent out from the mother country to people this new ſettlement. At the diſſolution of the company, the nation, in return for this waſte of treaſure and of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did not receive from Virginia an annual importation of commodities exceeding twenty thouſand pounds in value; and the colony was ſo far from having added ſtrength to the ſtate by an increaſe of population, that, in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and twenty-four, ſcarcely two thouſand perſons ſurvived,<note n="†" place="bottom">Chalmers' Annals, p. 69.</note> a wretched remnant of the numerous emigrants who had flocked thither, with ſanguine expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of a very different fate.</p>
            <p>The company, like all unproſperous ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, fell unpitied. The violent hand with which prerogative had invaded its rights was forgotten, and new proſpects of ſucceſs open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under a form of government exempt from all the defects to which paſt diſaſters were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. The king and the nation concurred with equal ardour in reſolving to encourage the colony. Soon after the final judgment in the Court of King's Bench againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, James appointed a council of twelve
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:036237_0104_1008A39547750308"/>
perſons to take the temporary direction of affairs in Virginia, (Auguſt 26) that he might have leiſure to frame with deliberate conſideration proper regulations for the permanent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the colony.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, xvii. 618, &amp;c.</note> Pleaſed with ſuch an opportunity of exerciſing his talents as a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, he began to turn his attention towards the ſubject; but death prevented him from completing his plan.</p>
            <p>Charles I. on his acceſſion to the throne, (1625, March 27) adopted all his father's maxims with reſpect to the colony in Virginia. He declared it to be a part of the empire an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the crown, and immediately ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to its juriſdiction; he conferred the title of Governor on Sir George Yardely, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, in conjunction with a council of twelve, and a ſecretary, to exerciſe ſupreme authority there, and enjoined them to conform in every point to ſuch inſtructions as from time to time they might receive from him.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. xviii. 72.311.</note> From the tenor of the king's commiſſion, as well as from the known ſpirit of his policy, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that he intended to veſt every power of government, both legiſlative and executive, in the governor and council, without recourſe to the repreſentatives of the people, as poſſeſſing a right to enact laws for the community, or
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:036237_0105_1008A396DFB02AD8"/>
to impoſe taxes upon it. Yardely and his council, who ſeem to have been fit inſtruments for carrying this ſyſtem of arbitrary rule into execution, did not fail to put ſuch a conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the words of their commiſſion as was moſt favourable to their own juriſdiction. During a great part of Charles's reign, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia knew no other law than the will of the ſovereign. Statutes were publiſhed, and taxes impoſed, without once calling the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people to authorize them by their ſanction. At the ſame time that the coloniſts were bereaved of political rights which they deemed eſſential to freemen and citizens, their private property was violently invaded. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was iſſued, by which, under pretexts equally abſurd and frivolous, they were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited from ſelling tobacco to any perſon but certain commiſſioners appointed by the king to purchaſe it on his account;<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, xviii. 19.</note> and they had the cruel mortification to behold the ſovereign, who ſhould have afforded them protection, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs all the profits of their induſtry, by ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only valuable commodity which they had to vend, and retaining the monopoly of it in his own hands. While the ſtaple of the colony in Virginia ſunk in value under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and reſtraints of a monopoly, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in land was rendered inſecure by various

grants of it, which Charles inconſiderately beſtowed upon his favourites. Theſe were not only of ſuch exorbitant extent as to be unfavourable to the progreſs of cultivation; but from inattention, or imperfect acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the geography of the country, their boundaries were ſo inaccurately defined, that large tracts already occupied and planted were often included in them.</p>
            <p>The murmurs and complaints which ſuch a ſyſtem of adminiſtration excited, were aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the rigour with which Sir John Harvey, who ſucceeded Yardely in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the colony,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rymer, xviii. 980.</note> enforced every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Rapacious, unfeeling, and haughty, he added inſolence to oppreſſion, and neither regarded the ſentiments, nor liſtened to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of the people under his command. The coloniſts, far from the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and overawed by authority derived from a royal commiſſion, ſubmitted long to his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and exactions. Their patience was at laſt exhauſted, and in a tranſport of popular rage and indignation, they ſeized their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and ſent him a priſoner to England, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by two of their number, whom they deputed to prefer their accuſations againſt

him to the king. But this attempt to redreſs their own wrongs, by a proceeding ſo ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and violent as is hardly conſiſtent with any idea of regular government, and can be juſtified only in caſes of ſuch urgent neceſſity as rarely occur in civil ſociety, was altogether repugnant to every notion which Charles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with reſpect to the obedience due by ſubjects to their ſovereign. To him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the coloniſts appeared to be not only an uſurpation of his right to judge and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh one of his own officers, but an open and audacious act of rebellion againſt his authority. Without deigning to admit their deputies into his preſence, or to hear one article of their charge againſt Harvey, the king inſtantly ſent him back to his former ſtation, with an ample renewal of all the powers belonging to it. But though Charles deemed this vigorous ſtep ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to aſſert his own authority, and to teſtify his diſpleaſure with thoſe who had preſumed to offer ſuch an inſult to it, he ſeems to have been ſo ſenſible of the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances under which the coloniſts groaned, and of the chief ſource from which they flowed, that ſoon after, he not only removed a gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſo juſtly odious to them, but named as a ſucceſſor Sir William Berkeley, a perſon far ſuperior to Harvey in rank and abilities, and ſtill more diſtinguiſhed by poſſeſſing all the

            <p>Under his government the colony in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia remained, with ſome ſhort intervals of interruption, almoſt forty years, and to his mild and prudent adminiſtration its increaſe and proſperity is in a great meaſure to be aſcribed. It was indebted, however, to the king himſelf for ſuch a reform of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and policy, as gave a different aſpect to the colony, and animated all its operations with new ſpirit. Though the tenor of Sir William Berkeley's commiſſion was the ſame with that of his predeceſſor, he received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions under the great ſeal, by which he was empowered to declare, that in all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, civil as well as eccleſiaſtical, the colony was to be governed according to the laws of England; he was directed to iſſue writs for electing repreſentatives of the people, who, in conjunction with the governor and council, were to form a general aſſembly, and to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs ſupreme legiſlative authority in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; he was ordered to eſtabliſh courts of juſtice, in which all queſtions, whether civil or criminal, were to be decided agreeably to the forms of judicial procedure in the mother country. It is not eaſy to diſcover what were
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:036237_0109_1008A3A3D4769DF0"/>
the motives which induced a monarch tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in adhering to any opinion or ſyſtem which he had once adopted, jealous to exceſs of his own rights, and adverſe on every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to any extenſion of the privileges claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his people, to relinquiſh his original plan of adminiſtration in the colony, and to grant ſuch immunities to his ſubjects ſettled there. From the hiſtorians of Virginia, no leſs ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial than ill-informed, no light can be deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reſpect to this point. It is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that dread of the ſpirit then riſing in Great Britain extorted from Charles conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo favourable to Virginia. After an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of almoſt twelve years, the ſtate of his affairs compelled him to have recourſe to the great council of the nation. There his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would find a juriſdiction independent of the crown, and able to control its authority. There they hoped for legal redreſs of all their grievances. As the coloniſts in Virginia had applied for relief to a former parliament, it might be expected with certainty, that they would lay their caſe before the firſt meeting of an aſſembly, in which they were ſecure of a favourable audience. Charles knew, that if the ſpirit of his adminiſtration in Virginia were to be tried by the maxims of the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it muſt be ſeverely reprehended. He was aware that many meaſures of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his government would be brought
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:036237_0110_1008A3A738F80BA0"/>
under a ſtrict review in parliament; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give mal-contents the advantage of adding a charge of oppreſſion in the remote parts of his dominions to a catalogue of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic grievances, he artfully endeavoured to take the merit of having granted voluntarily to his people in Virginia ſuch privileges as he foreſaw would be extorted from him.</p>
            <p>But though Charles eſtabliſhed the internal government of Virginia on a model ſimilar to that of the Engliſh conſtitution, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on his ſubjects there all the rights of freemen and citizens, he was extremely ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to maintain its connection with the parent ſtate. With this view he inſtructed Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Berkeley ſtrictly to prohibit any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the colony with foreign nations; and in order more certainly to ſecure excluſive poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all the advantages ariſing from the ſale of its productions, he was required to take a bond from the maſter of each veſſel that ſailed from Virginia, to land his cargo in ſome part of the king's dominions in Europe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Chalmers' Annals, p <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Even after monarchy was aboliſhed, after one king had been beheaded, and another driven into exile, the authority of the crown continued to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged (1650) and revered in Virginia. Irritated at this open defiance of its power, the parliament iſſued an ordinance, declaring, that as the ſettlement in Virginia had been made at the coſt and by the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it ought to be ſubordinate to and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon the Engliſh commonwealth, and ſubject to ſuch laws and regulations as are or ſhall be made in parliament; that, inſtead of this dutiful ſubmiſſion, the coloniſts had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the authority of the ſtate, and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly rebelled againſt it; that on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they were denounced notorious traitors, and not only all veſſels belonging to natives of England, but thoſe of foreign nations, were prohibited to enter their ports, or to carry on any commerce with them.</p>

were prompt and vigorous. A powerful ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, with a conſiderable body of land forces, was diſpatched to reduce the Virginians to obedience. After compelling the colonies in Barbadoes and the other iſlands to ſubmit to the commonwealth, the ſquadron entered the Bay of Cheſapeak (1651).

ſtate, and of ſecuring to it the benefit of their increaſing commerce. With this view the parliament framed two laws (1651) one of which expreſsly prohibited all mercantile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between the colonies and foreign ſtates, and the other ordained, that no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Aſia, Africa, or America, ſhould be imported into the dominions of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, but in veſſels belonging to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh owners, or to the people of the colonies ſettled there, and navigated by an Engliſh commander,<note n="*" place="bottom">Scobel's Acts, p. 132. 176.</note> and by crews of which the greater part muſt be Engliſhmen.

Warmly attached to the cauſe for which they had fought and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and animated with all the paſſions natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to men recently engaged in a fierce and long protracted civil war, they, by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the coloniſts, confirmed them in principles of loyalty, and added to their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and indignation under the reſtraints im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on their commerce by their new maſters.

On receiving the firſt account of this event, the joy and exultation of the colony were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and unbounded. Theſe, however, were not of long continuance. Gracious, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>productive profeſſions of eſteem and good-will were the only return made by Charles to loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and ſervices, which in their own eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were ſo diſtinguiſhed that no recompence was beyond what they might claim. If the king's neglect and ingratitude diſappointed all the ſanguine hopes which their vanity had founded on the merit of their paſt conduct, the ſpirit which influenced parliament in its commercial deliberations, opened a proſpect that alarmed them with reſpect to their future ſituation. In framing regulations for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of trade, which, during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of civil war, and amidſt continual fluctuations in government, had met with ſuch obſtruction that it declined in every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Houſe of Commons, inſtead of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the colonies that relief which they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the reſtraints in their commerce im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the commonwealth and Cromwell, not only adopted all their ideas concerning this branch of legiſlation, but extended them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            <p>By theſe ſucceſſive regulations, the plan of ſecuring to England a monopoly of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with its colonies, and of ſhutting up every other channel into which it might be diverted, was perfected and reduced into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſyſtem. On one ſide of the Atlantic, theſe regulations have been extolled as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effort of political ſagacity, and have been conſidered as the great charter of national commerce, to which the preſent ſtate is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for all its opulence and power. On the other, they have been execrated as a code of oppreſſion, more ſuited to the illiberality of mercantile ideas, than to extenſive views of legiſlative wiſdom. Which of theſe opinions is beſt founded, I ſhall examine at large in another part of this work. But in writing the hiſtory of the Engliſh ſettlements in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, it was neceſſary to trace the progreſs of thoſe reſtraining laws with accuracy, as in every ſubſequent tranſaction we may obſerve a

perpetual exertion, on the part of the mother-country, to enforce and extend them; and on the part of the colonies, endeavours no leſs unremitting, to elude or to obſtruct their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Hardly was the act of navigation known in Virginia, and its effects begun to be felt, when the colony remonſtrated againſt it as a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and petitioned earneſtly for relief. But the commercial ideas of Charles and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters coincided ſo perfectly with thoſe of parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, that, inſtead of liſtening with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ear to their applications, they labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſiduouſly to carry the act into ſtrict execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this purpoſe, inſtructions were iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued to the governor, forts were built on the banks of the principal rivers, and ſmall veſſels appointed to cruize on the coaſt. The Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, ſeeing no proſpect of obtaining exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the act, ſet themſelves to evade it, and found means, notwithſtanding the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with which they were watched, of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a conſiderable clandeſtine trade with foreigners, particularly with the Dutch ſettled on Hudſon's River. Emboldened by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſaffection ſpread through the colony, ſome veteran ſoldiers who had ſerved under Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and had been baniſhed to Virginia, (1663) formed a deſign of rendering themſelves maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the country, and of aſſerting its inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:036237_0120_1008A3C38804DB40"/>
on England. This raſh project was diſcovered by one of their aſſociates, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted by the vigorous exertions of Sir William Berkeley. But the ſpirit of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, though repreſſed was not extinguiſhed. Every day ſomething occurred to revive and to nouriſh it. As it is with extreme difficulty that commerce can be turned into a new chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, tobacco, the ſtaple of the colony, ſunk prodigiouſly in value, when they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to ſend it all to one market. It was ſome time before England could furniſh them regularly full aſſortments of thoſe neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, without which the induſtry of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony could not be carried on, or its proſperity ſecured. Encouraged by the ſymptoms of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral languor and deſpondency, which this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining ſtate of the colony occaſioned, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians ſeated towards the heads of the rivers ventured firſt to attack the remote ſettlements, and then to make incurſions into the interior parts of the country. Unexpected as theſe hoſtilities were, from a people who during a long period had lived in friendſhip with the Engliſh, a meaſure taken by the king ſeems to have excited ſtill greater terror among the moſt opulent people in the colony. Charles had imprudently imitated the example of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by granting ſuch large tracts of land in Virginia to ſeveral of his courtiers, as tended to unſettle the diſtribution of property in the

            <p>Such a leader they found in Nathaniel Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, a colonel of militia, who, though he had been ſettled in Virginia only three years, had acquired, by popular manners, an inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating addreſs, and the conſideration derived from having been regularly trained in England to the profeſſion of law, ſuch general eſteem, that he had been admitted into the council, and was regarded as one of the moſt reſpectable perſons in the colony. Bacon was ambitious, eloquent, daring, and prompted either by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt zeal to redreſs the public wrongs, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by hopes of raiſing himſelf to diſtinction and power, he mingled with the mal-contents, and by his bold harangues and confident pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of removing all their grievances, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed them almoſt to madneſs. As the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations committed by the Indians was the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:036237_0122_1008A3C897E36310"/>
calamity moſt ſenſibly felt by the people, he accuſed the governor of having neglected the proper meaſures for repelling the invaſions of the ſavages, and exhorted them to take arms in their own defence, and to exterminate that odious race. Great numbers aſſembled, and choſe Bacon to be their general. He applied to the governor for a commiſſion, confirming this election of the people, and offered to march inſtantly againſt the common enemy. Berkeley, accuſtomed by long poſſeſſion of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme command to high ideas of the reſpect due to his ſtation, conſidered this tumultuary armament as an open inſult to his authority, and ſuſpected that, under ſpecious appearances, Bacon concealed moſt dangerous deſigns. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, however, to give farther provocation to an incenſed multitude, by a direct refuſal of what they demanded, he thought it prudent to negociate, in order to gain time; and it was not until he found all endeavours to ſooth them ineffectual, that he iſſued a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, requiring them, in the king's name, under the pain of being denounced rebels, to diſperſe.</p>
            <p>But Bacon, ſenſible that he had now advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſo far as rendered it impoſſible to recede with honour or ſafety, inſtantly took the only reſolution that remained in his ſituation. At the head of a choſen body of his followers
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:036237_0123_1008A3CAEF107258"/>
he marched rapidly to James-Town, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding the houſe where the governor and council were aſſembled, demanded the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for which he had formerly applied. Berkeley, with the proud indignant ſpirit of a cavalier, diſdaining the requiſitions of a rebel, peremptorily refuſed to comply, and calmly preſented his naked breaſt to the weapons which were pointed againſt it. The council, however, foreſeeing the fatal conſequences of driving an enraged multitude, in whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they were, to the laſt extremities of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, prepared a commiſſion, conſtituting Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con general of all the forces in Virginia, and by their entreaties prevailed on the governor to ſign it. Bacon with his troops retired in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Hardly was the council delivered by his departure from the dread of preſent danger, when, by a tranſition not unuſual in feeble minds, preſumptuous boldneſs ſucceeded to exceſſive fear. The commiſſion granted to Bacon was declared to be null, having been extorted by force; he was proclaimed a rebel, his followers were required to abandon his ſtandard, and the militia ordered to arm and to join the governor.</p>
            <p>Enraged at conduct which he branded with the name of baſe and treacherous, Bacon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of continuing his march towards the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="unknown:036237_0124_1008A3CE74373FA0"/>
with all his forces to James-Town. The governor, unable to reſiſt ſuch a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous body, made his eſcape, and fled acroſs the bay to Acomack on the Eaſtern ſhore. Some of the counſellors accompanied him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, others retired to their own plantations. Upon the flight of Sir William Berkeley, and diſperſion of the council, the frame of civil government in the colony ſeemed to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Bacon became poſſeſſed of ſupreme and uncontrolled power. But as he was ſenſible that his countrymen would not long ſubmit with patience to authority acquired and held merely by force of arms, he endeavoured to found it on a more conſtitutional baſis, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſanction of the people's approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. With this view he called together the moſt conſiderable gentlemen in the colony, and having prevailed on them to bind themſelves by oath to maintain his authority, and to reſiſt every enemy that ſhould oppoſe it, he from that time conſidered his juriſdiction as legally eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Berkeley, meanwhile, having collected ſome forces, made inroads into different parts of the colony, where Bacon's authority was recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized. Several ſharp conflicts happened with various ſucceſs. James-Town was reduced to aſhes, and the beſt cultivated diſtricts in the province were laid waſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſometimes by one
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:036237_0125_1008A3D00B7764F0"/>
party, and ſometimes by the other. But it was not by his own exertions that the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor hoped to terminate the conteſt. He had early tranſmitted an account of the tranſactions in Virginia to the king, and demanded ſuch a body of ſoldiers as would enable him to quell the inſurgents, whom he repreſented as ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated by the reſtraints impoſed on their trade, that they were impatient to ſhake of all dependance on the parent ſtate. Charles, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a commotion no leſs dangerous than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, and ſolicitous to maintain his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over a colony, the value of which was daily increaſing, and more fully underſtood, ſpeedily diſpatched a ſmall ſquadron, with ſuch a number of regular troops as Berkeley had required. Bacon and his followers receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed information of this armament, but were not intimidated at its approach. They boldly determined to oppoſe it with open force, and declared it to be conſiſtent with their duty and allegiance, to treat all who ſhould aid Sir William Berkeley as enemies, until they ſhould have an opportunity of laying their grievances before their ſovereign.<note n="*" place="bottom">Beverley's Hiſt. p. 75, 76.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But while both parties prepared, (1677) with equal animoſity, to involve their country in the horrors of civil war, an event happened,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:036237_0126_1008A3D2A892FA68"/>
which quieted the commotion almoſt as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly as it had been excited. Bacon, when ready to take the field, ſickened and died. None of his followers poſſeſſed ſuch talents, or were ſo much objects of the people's confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as entitled them to aſpire to the ſupreme command. Deſtitute of a leader to conduct and animate them, their ſanguine hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſubſided; mutual diſtruſt accompanied this univerſal deſpondency; all began to wiſh for an accommodation; and after a ſhort negociation with Sir William Berkeley, they laid down their arms, and ſubmitted to his government, on obtaining a promiſe of general pardon.</p>
            <p>Thus terminated an inſurrection, which, in the annals of Virginia, is diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Bacon's rebellion.</hi> During ſeven months this daring leader was maſter of the colony, while the royal governor was ſhut up in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and ill-peopled corner of it. What were the real motives that prompted him to take arms, and to what length he intended to carry his plans of reformation, either in commerce or government, it is not eaſy to diſcover, in the ſcanty materials from which we derive our infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with reſpect to this tranſaction. It is probable, that his conduct, like that of other adventurers in faction, would have been regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted chiefly by events; and accordingly as theſe proved favourable or adverſe, his views and
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:036237_0127_1008A3D59320AEC8"/>
requiſitions would have been extended or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed.</p>
            <p>Sir William Berkeley, as ſoon as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtated in his office, called together the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people, that by their advice and authority public tranquillity and order might be perfectly eſtabliſhed. Though this aſſembly met a few weeks after the death of Bacon, while the memory of reciprocal injuries was ſtill recent, and when the paſſions excited by ſuch a fierce conteſt had but little time to ſubſide, its proceedings were conducted with a moderation ſeldom exerciſed by the ſucceſsful party in a civil war. No man ſuffered capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; a ſmall number were ſubjected to fines; others were declared incapable of holding any office of truſt; and with thoſe exceptions, the promiſe of general indemnity was confirmed by law. Soon after, Berkeley was recalled, and Colonel Jefferys was appointed his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor.</p>
            <p>From that period, to the Revolution in 1688, there is ſcarcely any memorable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the hiſtory of Virginia. A peace was concluded with the Indians. Under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſucceſſive governors, adminiſtration was carried on in the colony with the ſame arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſpirit that diſtinguiſhed the latter years of Charles II. and the precipitate counſels of
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:036237_0128_1008A3D8DA03B2D0"/>
James II. The Virginians, with a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which, in form, reſembled that of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, enjoyed hardly any portion of the liberty which that admirable ſyſtem of policy is framed to ſecure. They were deprived even of the laſt conſolation of the oppreſſed, the power of complaining, by a law which, under ſevere penalties, prohibited them from ſpeaking diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectfully of the governor, or defaming, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by words or writing, the adminiſtration of the colony.<note n="*" place="bottom">Beverley, p. 81.

But notwithſtanding thoſe unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable circumſtances, the colony continued to increaſe. The uſe of tobacco was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come general in Europe; and though it had fallen conſiderably in price, the extent of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand compenſated that diminution, and by giving conſtant employment to the induſtry of the planters diffuſed wealth among them.

            <head>THE HISTORY OF AMERICA. BOOK X.</head>
            <p>WHEN James I. in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix-hundred and ſix, made that magnificent partition, which has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, of a vaſt region in North America, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from the thirty-fourth to the forty-fifth degree of latitude, between two trading companies of his ſubjects, he eſtabliſhed the reſidence of the one in London, and of the other in Plymouth. The former was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to ſettle in the ſouthern, and the latter in the northern part of this territory, then diſtinguiſhed by the general name of Virginia. This arrangement ſeems to have been formed upon the idea of ſome ſpeculative refiner, who
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:036237_0130_1008A3DDAAD95C40"/>
aimed at diffuſing the ſpirit of induſtry, by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeat of one branch of the trade that was now to be opened, on the eaſt coaſt of the iſland, and the other on the weſt. But Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don poſſeſſes ſuch advantages of ſituation, that the commercial wealth and activity of England have always centered in the capital. At the beginning of the laſt century, the ſuperiority of the metropolis in both theſe reſpects was ſo great, that though the powers and privileges conferred by the king on the two trading com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies were preciſely the ſame, the adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ſettled in Plymouth ſell far ſhort of thoſe in London, in the vigour and ſucceſs of their efforts towards accompliſhing the purpoſe of their inſtitution. Though the operations of the Plymouth company were animated by the public-ſpirited zeal of Sir John Popham, chief juſtice of England, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and ſome other gentlemen of the weſt, all its exertions were feeble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.</p>
            <p>The firſt veſſel fitted out by the company (1606) was taken by the Spaniards. In the year one thouſand ſix hundred and ſeven, a feeble ſettlement was made at Sagahadoc; but, on account of the rigour of the climate, was ſoon relinquiſhed, and for ſome time nothing farther was attempted than a few fiſhing voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to Cape Cod, or a pitiful traffic with the
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:036237_0131_1008A3E12E86A118"/>
natives for ſkins and oil. One of the veſſels equipped for this purpoſe was commanded by Captain Smith, whoſe name has been ſo often mentioned with diſtinction in the hiſtory of Virginia. The adventure was proſperous and lucrative (1614.) But his ardent enterpriſing mind could not confine its attention to objects ſo unequal to it as the petty details of a trading voyage. He employed a part of his time in exploring the coaſt, and in delineating its bays and harbours. On his return, he laid a map of it before Prince Charles, and, with the uſual exaggeration of diſcoverers, painted the beauty and excellence of the country in ſuch glowing colours, that the young Prince, in the warmth of admiration, declared, that it ſhould be called New England;<note n="*" place="bottom">Smith's Travels, Book vi. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The favourable accounts of the country by Smith, as well as the ſucceſs of his voyage, ſeem to have encouraged private adventurers to proſecute the trade on the coaſt of New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with greater briſkneſs; but did not inſpire the languiſhing company of Plymouth with ſuch vigour, as to make any new attempt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eſtabliſhing a permanent colony there. Something more than the proſpect of diſtant
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:036237_0132_1008A3E2C2FF6138"/>
gain to themſelves, or of future advantages to their country, was requiſite, in order to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men to abandon the place of their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to migrate to another quarter of the globe, and endure innumerable hardſhips un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an untried climate, and in an uncultivated land, covered with woods, or occupied by fierce and hoſtile tribes of ſavages. But what mere attention to private emolument or to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional utility could not effect, was accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the operation of an higher principle. Religion had gradually excited among a great body of the people, a ſpirit that fitted them remarkably for encountering the dangers, and ſurmounting the obſtacles, which had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rendered abortive the ſchemes of coloniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that part of America allotted to the company of Plymouth. As the various ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements in New England are indebted for their origin to this ſpirit, as in the courſe of our narrative we ſhall diſcern its influence mingling in all their tranſactions, and giving a peculiar tincture to the character of the people, as well as to their inſtitutions, both civil and eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, it becomes neceſſary to trace its riſe and progreſs with attention and accuracy.</p>
            <p>When the ſuperſtitions and corruptions of the Romiſh church prompted different nations of Europe to throw off its yoke, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from its communion, the mode as well
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:036237_0133_1008A3E5764422B8"/>
as degree of their ſeparation was various. Wherever reformation was ſudden, and carried on by the people without authority from their rulers, or in oppoſition to it, the rupture was violent and total. Every part of the ancient fabric was overturned, and a different ſyſtem, not only with reſpect to doctrine, but to church government, and the external rites of worſhip, was eſtabliſhed. Calvin, who, by his abilities, learning, and auſterity of manners, had acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed high reputation and authority in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant churches, was a zealous advocate for this plan of thorough reformation. He exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a model of that pure form of eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical policy, which he approved in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the church of Geneva. The ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of its inſtitutions, and ſtill more their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to thoſe of the Popiſh church, were ſo much admired by all the ſtricter reformers, that it was copied, with ſome ſmall variations, in Scotland, in the Republic of the United Provinces, in the dominions of the Houſe of Brandenburgh, in thoſe of the Elector Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and in the churches of the Hugonots in France.</p>
            <p>But in thoſe countries where the ſteps of departure from the church of Rome were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with greater deliberation, and regulated by the wiſdom or policy of the ſupreme magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, the ſeparation was not ſo wide. Of all
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:036237_0134_1008A3E70ECC0E30"/>
the reformed churches, that of England has deviated leaſt from the ancient inſtitutions. The violent but capricious ſpirit of Henry VIII. who, though he diſclaimed the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, revered the tenets of the Papal ſee, checked innovations in doctrine or worſhip during his reign. When his ſon aſcended the throne, and the Proteſtant religion was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by law, the cautious prudence of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Cranmer moderated the zeal of thoſe who had eſpouſed the new opinions. Though the articles to be recognized as the ſyſtem of national faith, were framed conformably to the doctrines of Calvin, his notions with reſpect to church government and the mode of worſhip were not adopted. As the hierarchy in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was incorporated with the civil policy of the kingdom, and conſtituted a member of the legiſlature, archbiſhops and biſhops, with all the ſubordinate ranks of eccleſiaſtics ſubject to them, were continued according to ancient form, and with the ſame dignity and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The peculiar veſtments in which the clergy performed their ſacred functions, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the name of Jeſus, kneeling at receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the ſign of the Croſs in baptiſm, the uſe of the Ring in marriage, with ſeveral other rites to which long uſage had accuſtomed the people, and which time had rendered venerable, were ſtill retained. But though Parliament enjoined the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:036237_0135_1008A3EAE7D21398"/>
obſervance of theſe ceremonies under very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties,<note n="*" place="bottom">2 and 3 Edw. VI. c. 1.</note> ſeveral of the more zealous clergy entertained ſcruples with reſpect to the lawfulneſs of complying with this injunction; and the vigilance and authority of Cranmer and Ridley, with difficulty, ſaved their infant church from the diſgrace of a ſchiſm on this account.</p>
            <p>On the acceſſion of Mary, the furious zeal with which ſhe perſecuted all who had adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tenets of the Reformers forced many eminent Proteſtants, laymen as well as eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics, to ſeek an aſylum on the continent. Francfort, Geneva, Baſil, and Straſburgh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with affectionate hoſpitality as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers in the cauſe of truth, and the magiſtrates permitted them to aſſemble by themſelves for religious worſhip. The exiles who took up their reſidence in the two former cities mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled their little congregations according to the ideas of Calvin, and, with a ſpirit natural to men in their ſituation, eagerly adopted inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions which appeared to be farther removed from the ſuperſtitions of Popery than thoſe of their own church. They returned to England as ſoon as Elizabeth re-eſtabliſhed the Proteſtant religion, not only with more violent antipathy to the opinions and practices of that church
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:036237_0136_1008A3EE3815F8A0"/>
by which they had been oppreſſed, but with a ſtrong attachment to that mode of worſhip to which they had been for ſome years accuſtomed. As they were received by their countrymen with the veneration due to confeſſors, they exerted all the influence derived from that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in order to obtain ſuch a reformation in the Engliſh ritual, as might bring it nearer to the ſtandard of purity in foreign churches. Some of the queen's moſt confidential miniſters were warmly diſpoſed to co-operate with them in this meaſure. But Elizabeth paid little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the inclinations of the one, or the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the other.

            <p>The advocates for a farther reformation, notwithſtanding this cruel diſappointment of the ſanguine hopes with which they returned to their native country, did not relinquiſh their deſign. They diſſeminated their opinions with great induſtry among the people. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled the purity of foreign churches, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt the ſuperſtitious practices with
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:036237_0138_1008A3F2512E2D98"/>
which religion was defiled in their own church. In vain did the defenders of the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem repreſent that theſe forms and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were, in themſelves, things perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, which, from long uſage, were view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reverence; and, by their impreſſion upon the ſenſes and imagination, tended not only to fix the attention, but to affect the heart, and to warm it with devout and worthy ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Puritans (for by that name ſuch as ſcrupled to comply with what was enjoined by the act of uniformity were diſtinguiſhed) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the rites in queſtion were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, ſuperadded to the ſimple and reaſonable ſervice required in the word of God; that from the exceſſive ſolicitude with which conformity to them was exacted, the multitude muſt conceive ſuch an high opinion of their value and importance, as might induce them to reſt ſatisfied with the mere form and ſhadow of religion, and to imagine that external obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances may compenſate for the want of inward ſanctity; that ceremonies which had been long employed by a ſociety manifeſtly corrupt, to veil its own defects, and to ſeduce and faſcinate mankind, ought now to be rejected as relics of ſuperſtition unworthy of a place in a church which gloried in the name of <hi>Reformed.</hi>

<pb n="143" facs="unknown:036237_0139_1008A3F400225CE0"/>
to the arguments of the contending parties; and it is obvious to which of them, men who had lately beheld the ſuperſtitious ſpirit of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and felt its perſecuting rage, would lend the moſt favourable ear. The deſire of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeparation from the church of Rome ſpread wide through the nation. The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who contended for this, and who refuſed to wear the ſurplice, and other veſtments pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to their order, or to obſerve the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies enjoined by law, were followed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, while the miniſtry of the zealous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for conformity was deſerted, and their perſons often expoſed to inſult. For ſome time the non-conformiſts were connived at; but as their number and boldneſs increaſed, the interpoſition both of ſpiritual and civil autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was deemed neceſſary in order to check their progreſs. To the diſgrace of Chriſtians, the ſacred rights of conſcience and private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as the charity and mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance ſuitable to the mild ſpirit of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they profeſſed, were in that age little underſtood. Not only the idea of tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but even the word itſelf in the ſenſe now affixed to it, was then unknown. Every church claimed a right to employ the hand of power for the protection of truth and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of error. The laws of her kingdom armed Elizabeth with ample authority for this purpoſe, and ſhe was abundantly diſpoſed to
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:036237_0140_1008A3F661782938"/>
exerciſe it with full vigour. Many of the moſt eminent among the Puritan clergy were deprived of their benefices, others were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, ſeveral were fined, and ſome put to death. But perſecution, as uſually happens, inſtead of extinguiſhing, inflamed their zeal to ſuch a height, that the juriſdiction of the ordinary courts of law was deemed inſufficient to ſuppreſs it, and a new tribunal was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed under the title of the <hi>high commiſſion for eccleſiaſtical affairs,</hi> whoſe powers and mode of procedure were hardly leſs odious or leſs hoſtile to the principles of juſtice, than thoſe of the Spaniſh inquiſition. Several attempts were made in the Houſe of Commons to check theſe arbitrary proceedings, and to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the rage of perſecution; but the Queen always impoſed ſilence upon thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to deliver any opinion with reſpect to a matter appertaining ſolely to her prerogative, in a tone as imperious and arrogant as was ever uſed by Henry VIII. in addreſſing his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and ſo tamely obſequious were the guardians of the people's rights, that they not only obeyed thoſe unconſtitutional commands, but conſented to an act, by which every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſhould abſent himſelf from church during a month was ſubjected to puniſhment by fine and impriſonment; and if after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction he did not, within three months, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his erroneous opinions, and conform to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:036237_0141_1008A3F9A6EA5760"/>
the laws, he was then obliged to abjure the realm; but if he either refuſed to comply with this condition, or returned from baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſhould be put to death as a felon without benefit of clergy.<note n="*" place="bottom">35 Eliz. c. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By this iniquitous ſtatute, equally repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ideas of civil and of religious liberty, the Puritans were cut off from any hope of obtaining either reformation in the church or indulgence to themſelves. Exaſperated by this rigorous treatment, their antipathy to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed religion increaſed, and, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs natural to violent paſſions, carried them far beyond what was their original aim. The firſt Puritans did not entertain any ſcruples with reſpect to the lawfulneſs of Epiſcopal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſeem to have been very unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to withdraw from communion with the church of which they were members. But when they were thrown out of her boſom, and conſtrained to hold ſeparate aſſemblies for the worſhip of God, their followers no longer viewed a ſociety by which they were oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reverence or affection. Her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, her diſcipline, her ritual, were examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with minute attention. Every error was pointed out, and every defect magnified. The more boldly any teacher inveighed againſt the corruptions of the church, he was liſtened to with greater approbation; and the farther he
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:036237_0142_1008A3FBF8501F58"/>
urged his diſciples to depart from ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure community, the more eagerly did they follow him. By degrees, ideas of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal policy, altogether repugnant to thoſe of the eſtabliſhed church, gained footing in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The more ſober and learned Puritans inclined to that form which is known by the name of Preſbyterian. Such as were more thoroughly poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however much they might approve the equality of paſtors which that ſyſtem eſtabliſhes, reprobated the authority which it veſts in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious judicatories, deſcending from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regular ſubordination, as inconſiſtent with Chriſtian liberty.</p>
            <p>Theſe wild notions floated for ſome time in the minds of the people, and amuſed them with many ideal ſchemes of eccleſiaſtical policy. At length Robert Brown, (1580) a popular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimer in high eſtimation, reduced them to a ſyſtem, on which he modelled his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. He taught, that the church of England was corrupt and antichriſtian, its miniſters not lawfully ordained, its ordinances and ſacraments invalid; and therefore he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited his people to hold communion with it in any religious function. He maintained, that a ſociety of Chriſtians, uniting together to worſhip God, conſtituted a church, poſſeſſed of complete juriſdiction in the conduct of its
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:036237_0143_1008A3FE7815A698"/>
own affairs, independent of any other ſociety, and unaccountable to any ſuperior; that the prieſthood was neither a diſtinct order in the church, nor conferred an indelible character; but that every man qualified to teach might be ſet apart for that office by the election of the brethren, and by impoſition of their hands; in like manner, by their authority, he might be diſcharged from that function, and reduced to the rank of a private Chriſtian; that every perſon when admitted a member of a church ought to make a public confeſſion of his faith, and give evidence of his being in a ſtate of favour with God; and that all the affairs of a church were to be regulated by the deciſion of the majority of its members.</p>
            <p>This democratical form of government, which aboliſhed all diſtinction of ranks in the church, and conferred an equal portion of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on every individual, accorded ſo perfectly with the levelling genius of fanaticiſm, that it was fondly adopted by many as a complete model of Chriſtian policy. From their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they were denominated Browniſts; and as their tenets were more hoſtile to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed religion than thoſe of other ſeparatiſts, the fierceſt ſtorm of perſecution fell upon their heads. Many of them were fined or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and ſome put to death; and though Brown, with a levity of which there are few
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:036237_0144_1008A40198F9EBC0"/>
examples among enthuſiaſts whoſe vanity has been ſoothed by being recognized as heads of a party, abandoned his diſciples, conformed to the eſtabliſhed religion, and accepted of a benefice in the church, the ſect not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, but continued to ſpread, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong perſons in the middle and lower ranks of life. But as all their motions were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watched, both by the eccleſiaſtical and civil courts, which, as often as they were detected, puniſhed them with the utmoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, a body of them, weary of living in a ſtate of continual danger and alarm, fled to Holland, and ſettled in Leyden, under the care of Mr. John Robinſon, their paſtor. There they reſided for ſeveral years unmoleſted and obſcure. But many of their aged mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers dying, and ſome of the younger marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Dutch families, while their church received no increaſe, either by recruits from England, or by proſelytes gained in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they began to be afraid, that all their high attainments in ſpiritual knowledge would be loſt, and that perfect fabric of policy, which they had erected, would be diſſolved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to oblivion, if they remained longer in a ſtrange land.</p>
            <p>Deeply affected with the proſpect of an event, which to them appeared fatal to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of truth, they thought themſelves called,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:036237_0145_1008A4032BC692D0"/>
in order to prevent it, to remove to ſome other place, where they might profeſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their opinions with greater ſucceſs. America, in which their countrymen were at that time intent on planting colonies, preſented itſelf to their thoughts. They flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with hopes of being permitted, in that remote region, to follow their own ideas in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without diſturbance. The dangers and hardſhips to which all former emigrants to America had deen expoſed, did not deter them. "They were well weaned, (according to their own deſcription) from the delicate milk of their mother country, and enured to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of a ſtrange land. They were knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a ſtrict and ſacred band, by virtue of which they held themſelves obliged to take care of the good of each other, and of the whole. It was not with them, as with other men, whom ſmall things could diſcourage, or ſmall diſcontents cauſe to wiſh themſelves at home again."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon's Hiſt. of Maſſach. p. 4.</note> The firſt object of their ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude (1618) was to ſecure the free exerciſe of their religion. For this purpoſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the king; and though James refuſed to give them any explicit aſſurance of tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſeem to have obtained from him ſome promiſe of his connivance, as long as they continued to demean themſelves quietly.
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:036237_0146_1008A405C4027958"/>
So eager were they to accompliſh their favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſcheme, that, relying on this precarious ſecurity, they began to negociate with the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian company for a tract of land within the limits of their patent. This they eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from a ſociety deſirous of encouraging migration to a vaſt country, of which they had hitherto occupied only a few ſpots.</p>
            <p>After the utmoſt efforts, their preparations fell far ſhort of what was requiſite for begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſettlement of a new colony. A hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty perſons ſailed (1620, Sept. 6.) from England in a ſingle ſhip on this arduous undertaking. The place of their deſtination was Hudſon's River, where they intended to ſettle; but their captain having been bribed, as is ſaid, by the Dutch, who had then form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſcheme which they afterwards accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, of planting a colony there, carried them ſo far towards the north, that the firſt land in America which they made was Cape-Cod. They were now, (Nov. 11) not only beyond the precincts of the territory which had been granted to them, but beyond thoſe of the company from which they derived their right. The ſeaſon, however, was ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and ſickneſs raged ſo violently among men unaccuſtomed to the hardſhips of a long voyage, that it became neceſſary to take up their abode there. After exploring the coaſt,

they choſe for their ſtation, a place now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the province of Maſſachuſetts Bay, to which they gave the name of New Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, probably out of reſpect to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, within whoſe juriſdiction they now found themſelves ſituated.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hubard's Preſ.

            </p>
            <p>No ſeaſon could be more unfavourable to ſettlement than that in which the colony landed. The winter, which, from the predominance of cold in America, is rigorous to a degree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in parallel latitudes of our hemiſphere, was already ſet in; and they were ſlenderly provided with what was requiſite for comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſubſiſtance, under a climate conſiderably more ſevere than that for which they had made preparation. Above one half of them was cut off before the return of ſpring, by diſeaſes, or by famine; the ſurvivors, inſtead of having leiſure to attend to the ſupply of their own wants, were compelled to take arms againſt the ſavages in their neighbourhood. Happily for the Engliſh, a peſtilence, which raged in America the year before they landed, had ſwept off ſo great a number of the natives, that they were quickly repulſed and humbled. The privilege of profeſſing their own opinions, and of being governed by laws of their own framing, afforded conſolation to the coloniſts
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:036237_0148_1008A40B5DB76FE8"/>
amidſt all their dangers and hardſhips. The conſtitution of their church was the ſame with that which they had eſtabliſhed in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Their ſyſtem of civil government was founded on thoſe ideas of the natural equality among men, to which their eccleſiaſtical policy had accuſtomed them. Every free man, who was a member of the church, was admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſupreme legiſlative body. The laws of England were adopted as the baſis of their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudence, though with ſome diverſity in the puniſhments inflicted upon crimes, borrowed from the Moſaic inſtitutions. The executive power was veſted in a governor and ſome aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who were elected annually by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the legiſlative aſſembly.<note n="*" place="bottom">Chalmers' Annals, p. 87.</note> So far their inſtitutions appear to be founded on the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary maxims of human prudence. But it was a favourite opinion with all the enthuſiaſts of that age, that the ſcriptures contained a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſyſtem, not only of ſpiritual inſtruction, but of civil wiſdom and polity; and without attending to the peculiar circumſtances or ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the people whoſe hiſtory is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, they often deduced general rules for their own conduct, from what happened among men in a very different ſtate. Under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this wild notion, the coloniſts of New Plymouth, in imitation of the primitive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,

conſent of its members to recognize the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of laws, and ſubmit to the juriſdiction of magiſtrates framed and choſen by themſelves. In this ſtate it remained an independent, but feeble community, until it was united to its more powerful neighbour, the colony of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts Bay, the origin and progreſs of which I now proceed to relate.</p>
            <p>The original company of Plymouth having done nothing effectual towards eſtabliſhing any permanent ſettlement in America, James I. in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and twenty, iſſued a new charter to the Duke of Lenox, the Marquis of Buckingham, and ſeveral other perſons of diſtinction in his court, by which he conveyed to them a right to a territory in America, ſtill more extenſive than what had been granted to the former patentees, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating them as a body politic, in order to plant colonies there, with powers and juriſdiction ſimilar to thoſe contained in his charters to the companies of South and North Virginia. This ſociety was diſtinguiſhed by the name of the Grand Council of Plymouth for planting and governing New England. What conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of public utility could induce the king to commit ſuch an undertaking to perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſo ill qualified for conducting it, or what proſpect of private advantage prompted them to engage in it, the information we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:036237_0151_1008A4131B3CF238"/>
from contemporary writers does not ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to determine. Certain it is, that the expectations of both were diſappointed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many ſchemes and arrangements, all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the new aſſociates towards coloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation proved unſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>New England muſt have remained unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, if the ſame cauſes which occaſioned the emigration of the Browniſts had not continued to operate. Notwithſtanding the violent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution to which Puritans of every denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were ſtill expoſed, their number and zeal daily increaſed. As they now deſpaired of obtaining in their own country any relaxation of the penal ſtatutes enacted againſt their ſect, many began to turn their eyes towards ſome other place of retreat, where they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their own opinions with impunity. From the tranquillity which their brethren had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto enjoyed in New Plymouth, they hoped to find this deſired aſylum in New England; and by the activity of Mr. White, a non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt miniſter at Dorcheſter, an aſſociation was formed by ſeveral gentlemen who had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed Puritanical notions, in order to conduct a colony thither.

            <p>Of theſe they found, without difficulty, a ſufficient number, chiefly in the capital, and among perſons in the commercial and other induſtrious walks of life, who had openly joined the ſect of the Puritans, or ſecretly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured their opinions.

As it was only from royal authority that ſuch powers could be derived, they appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for theſe; and Charles granted their requeſt, with a facility which appears aſtoniſhing, when we conſider the principles and views of the men who were ſuitors for the favour.</p>

               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:036237_0153_1008A4174AA8BAB0"/>Time has been conſidered as the parent of political wiſdom, but its inſtructions are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ſlowly. Although the experience of above twenty years might have taught the Engliſh the impropriety of committing the government of ſettlements in America, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive corporations reſident in Europe, neither the king nor his ſubjects had profited ſo much by what paſſed before their eyes, as to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their ideas beyond thoſe adopted by James, in his firſt attempts towards coloniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The charter of Charles I. to the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers aſſociated for planting the province of Maſſachuſetts Bay, was perfectly ſimilar to thoſe granted by his father to the two Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian companies and to the council of Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth. The new adventurers were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated as a body politic, and their right to the territory, which they had purchaſed from the council of Plymouth, being confirmed by the king, they were empowered to diſpoſe of the lands, and to govern the people who ſhould ſettle upon them. The firſt governor of the company, and his aſſiſtants, were named by the crown; the right of electing their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors was veſted in the members of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. The executive power was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the governor and aſſiſtants; that of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation to the body of proprietors, who might make ſtatutes and orders for the good of the community, not inconſiſtent with the laws of
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:036237_0154_1008A41A8638B278"/>
England, and inforce the obſervance of them, according to the courſe of other corporations within the realm. Their lands were to be held by the ſame liberal tenure with thoſe granted to the Virginian company. They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſame temporary exemption from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal taxes, and from duties on goods exported or imported; and notwithſtanding their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration to America, they and their deſcendants were declared to be entitled to all the rights of natural-born ſubjects.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon's Collect. of Original Papers, p. 1. &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The manifeſt object of this charter was to confer on the adventurers who undertook to people the territory on Maſſachuſetts Bay, all the corporate rights poſſeſſed by the council of Plymouth, from which they had purchaſed it, and to form them into a public body, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling other great trading companies, which the ſpirit of monarchy had at that time mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied in the kingdom. The king ſeems not to have foreſeen, or to have ſuſpected, the ſecret intentions of thoſe who projected the meaſure; for ſo far was he from alluring emigrants, by any hopes of indulgence with reſpect to their religious ſcruples, or from promiſing any relaxation from the rigour of the penal ſtatutes againſt non-conformiſts, that he expreſsly provides for having the oath
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:036237_0155_1008A41E704FFF08"/>

Hiſt. of N. Engl. i. 124. This he repeats in his Hiſtory of the Puritans, ii. 210; and ſubſequent hiſtorians have copied him implicitly. No permiſſion of that kind, however, is contained in the charter; and ſuch an indulgence would have been inconſiſtent with all the maxims of Charles and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters during the courſe of his reign. At the time when Charles iſſued the charter, the influence of Laud over his councils was at its height, the Puritans were proſecuted with the greateſt ſeverity, and the kingdom was ruled entirely by prerogative. This is not an aera in which one can expect to meet with conceſſions in favour of non-conformiſts from a prince of Charles's character and principles.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever were the intentions of the king (1629) the adventurers kept their own object ſteadily in view. Soon after their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to eſtabliſh a colony were rendered com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete by the royal charter, they fitted out five ſhips for New England; on board of which embarked upwards of three hundred paſſengers, with a view of ſettling there. Theſe were moſtly zealous Puritans, whoſe chief induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to relinquiſh their native land was the hope of enjoying religious liberty, in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try far removed from the ſeat of government and the oppreſſion of eccleſiaſtical courts. Some eminent non-conformiſt miniſters accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them as their ſpiritual inſtructors. On their arrival in New England (June 29) they found the wretched remainder of a ſmall body
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:036237_0156_1008A4200CCABC08"/>
of emigrants, who had left England the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding year, under the conduct of Endicott, a deep enthuſiaſt, whom, prior to their incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the royal charter, the aſſociates had appointed deputy governor. They were ſettled at a place called by the Indians Naunekeag, and to which Endicott, with the fond affectation of fanatics of that age to employ the language and appellations of ſcripture in the affairs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life, had given the name of Salem.</p>
            <p>The emigrants under Endicott, and ſuch as now joined them, coincided perfectly in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious principles. They were Puritans of the ſtricteſt form; and to men of this character the inſtitution of a church was naturally of ſuch intereſting concern as to take place of every other object. In this firſt tranſaction, they diſplayed, at once, the extent of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at which they aimed. Without regard to the ſentiments of that monarch under the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whoſe authority they ſettled in America, and from whom they derived right to act as a body politic, and in contempt of the laws of England, with which the charter required that none of their acts or ordinances ſhould be inconſiſtent, they adopted in their infant church that form of policy which has ſince been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of Independent. They united together (Auguſt 6) in religious ſociety, by a ſolemn covenant with God, and with
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:036237_0157_1008A422DEF12C50"/>
one another, and in ſtrict conformity, as they imagined, to the rules of ſcripture. They elected a paſtor, a teacher, and an elder, whom they ſet apart for their reſpective offices, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the hands of the brethren. All who were that day admitted members of the church, ſignified their aſſent to a confeſſion of faith drawn up by their teacher, and gave an account of the foundation of their own hopes as Chriſtians; and it was declared, that no perſon ſhould hereafter be received into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion until he gave ſatisfaction to the church with reſpect to his faith and ſanctity. The form of public worſhip which they inſtituted was without a liturgy, diſincumbered of every ſuperfluous ceremony, and reduced to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtandard of Calviniſtic ſimplicity.<note n="*" place="bottom">Math.

            <p>It was with the utmoſt complacence that men, paſſionately attached to their own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and who had long been reſtrained from avowing them, employed themſelves in fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this model of a pure church. But, in the firſt moment that they began to taſte of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian liberty themſelves, they forgot that other men had an equal title to enjoy it. Some of their number, retaining an high veneration for the ritual of the Engliſh church, were ſo much offended at the total abolition of it, that they
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:036237_0158_1008A424D8106E50"/>
withdrew from communion with the newly-inſtituted church, and aſſembled ſeparately for the worſhip of God. With an inconſiſtency, of which there are ſuch flagrant inſtances among Chriſtians of every denomination, that it cannot be imputed as a reproach peculiar to any ſect, the very men who had themſelves fled from perſecution became perſecutors; and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in order to enforce their own opinions, to the ſame unhallowed weapons, againſt the employment of which they had lately remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated with ſo much violence. Endicott cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the two chief malcontents before him; and though they were men of note, and among the number of original patentees, he expelled them from the ſociety, and ſent them home in the ſhips which were returning to England.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mather, p. 19.

            <p>Meanwhile the directors of the company in England exerted their utmoſt endeavours in order to reinforce the colony with a numerous body of new ſettlers; and as the intolerant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Laud exacted conformity to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of the church with greater rigour

than ever, the condition of ſuch as had any ſcruples with reſpect to this, became ſo into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, that many accepted of their invitation to a ſecure retreat in New England. Several of theſe were perſons of greater opulence and of better condition than any who had hitherto migrated to that country. But as they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to employ their fortunes, as well as to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their perſons, in eſtabliſhing a permanent colony there, and foreſaw many inconveniences from their ſubjection to laws made without their own conſent, and framed by a ſociety which muſt always be imperfectly acquainted with their ſituation, they inſiſted that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate powers of the company ſhould be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from England to America, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the colony be veſted entirely in thoſe who, by ſettling in the latter country, became members of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon's Coll. of Papers, p. 25.</note> The company had already expended conſiderable ſums in proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſign of their inſtitution, without having received almoſt any return, and had no proſpect of gain, or even of reimburſement, but what was too remote and uncertain to be ſuitable to the ideas of merchants, the moſt numerous claſs of its members.

from an unpromiſing adventure, that, "by general conſent, it was determined, that the charter ſhould be transferred, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſettled in New England."<note n="*" place="bottom">Mather, p. 20.

            <p>In this ſingular tranſaction, to which there is nothing ſimilar in the hiſtory of Engliſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonization, two circumſtances merit particular attention; one is the power of the company to make this transference; the other is the ſilent acquieſcence with which the king permitted it to take place. If the validity of this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the company be tried by the charter which conſtituted it a body politic, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to it all the corporate powers with which it was inveſted, it is evident that it could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſe thoſe powers in any mode differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from what the charter preſcribed, nor ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate them in ſuch a manner, as to convert the juriſdiction of a trading corporation in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land into a provincial government in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. But from the firſt inſtitution of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Maſſachuſetts Bay, its members ſeem to have been animated with a ſpirit of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in civil policy, as well as in religion; and
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:036237_0161_1008A42F1CD7BE48"/>
by the habit of rejecting eſtabliſhed uſages in the one, they were prepared for deviating from them in the other. They had applied for a royal charter, in order to give legal effect to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> operations in England, as acts of a body politic; but the perſons whom they ſent out to America, as ſoon as they landed there, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered themſelves as individuals, united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by voluntary aſſociation, poſſeſſing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right of men who form a ſociety, to adopt what mode of government, and to exact what laws they deemed moſt conducive to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral felicity. Upon this principle of being entitled to judge and to decide for themſelves, they eſtabliſhed their church in Salem, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to the inſtitutions of the church of England, of which the charter ſuppoſed them to be members, and bound of conſequence to conformity with its ritual. Suitably to the ſame ideas, we ſhall obſerve them framing all their future plans of civil and eccleſiaſtical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. The king, though abundantly vigilant in obſerving and checking ſlighter encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on his prerogative, was either ſo much occupied at that time with other cares occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by his fatal breach with his parliament, that he could not attend to the proceedings of the company; or he was ſo much pleaſed with the proſpect of removing a body of turbulent ſubjects to a diſtant country, where they might be uſeful, and could not prove dangerous, that
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:036237_0162_1008A43270ED0640"/>
he was diſpoſed to connive at the irregularity of a meaſure which facilitated their departure.</p>
            <p>Without interruption from the crown, the adventurers proceeded to carry their ſcheme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution. In a general court, John Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp was appointed governor, and Thomas Dudley deputy-governor, and eighteen aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were choſen; in whom, together with the body of freemen who ſhould ſettle in New England (1630) were veſted all the corporate rights of the company. With ſuch zeal and activity did they prepare for emigration, that in the courſe of the enſuing year ſeventeen ſhips ſailed for New England, and aboard of theſe above fifteen hundred perſons, among whom were ſeveral of reſpectable families, and in eaſy circumſtances. On their arrival in New England, many were ſo ill ſatisfied with the ſituation of Salem, that they explored the country in queſt of ſome better ſtation; and ſettling in different places around the Bay, according to their various fancies, laid the foundations of Boſton, Charleſtown, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, Roxborough, and other towns, which have ſince become conſiderable in the province. In each of theſe a church was eſtabliſhed on the ſame model with that of Salem. This, together with the care of making proviſion for their ſubſiſtence during winter, occupied them entirely during ſome months. But in the firſt
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:036237_0163_1008A436CD34BCC0"/>
general court (October 19) their diſpoſition to conſider themſelves as members of an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ſociety, unconfined by the regulations in their charter, began to appear. The electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the governor and deputy governor, the appointment of all other officers, and even the power of making laws, all which were granted by the charter to the freemen, were taken from them, and veſted in the council of aſſiſtants. But the ariſtocratical ſpirit of this reſolution did not accord with the ideas of equality pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent among the people, who had been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed into an approbation of it. Next year (1631) the freemen, whoſe numbers had been greatly augmented by the admiſſion of new members, reſumed their former rights.</p>
            <p>But, at the ſame time, they ventured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from the charter in a matter of greater moment, which deeply affected all the future operations of the colony, and contributed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to form that peculiar character by which the people of New England have been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. A law was paſſed, declaring that none ſhall hereafter be admitted freemen, or be entitled to any ſhare in the government, or be capable of being choſen magiſtrates, or even of ſerving as jurymen, but ſuch as have been received into the church as members.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this reſolution, every perſon who did not hold the favourite opinions concerning the doctrines of religion, the diſcipline of the church, or the rites of worſhip, was at once caſt out of the ſociety, and ſtripped of all the privileges of a citizen. An uncontrolled power of approving or rejecting the claims of thoſe who applied for admiſſion into communion with the church being veſted in the miniſters and leading men of each congregation, the moſt valuable of all civil rights was made to depend on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, with reſpect to qualifications purely ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical. As in examining into theſe, they proceeded not by any known or eſtabliſhed rules, but exerciſed a diſcretionary judgment, the clergy roſe gradually to a degree of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and authority, from which the levelling ſpirit of the independent church policy was calculated to exclude them. As by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination the political condition of every ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen was fixed, all paid court to men poſſeſſed of ſuch an important power, by aſſuming thoſe auſtere and ſanctimonious manners which were known to be the moſt certain recommendation to their favour. In conſequence of this aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, which was acquired chiefly by the wildeſt enthuſiaſts among the clergy, their notions became a ſtandard to which all ſtudied to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and the ſingularities characteriſtic of the Puritans in that age increaſed, of which many remarkable inſtances will occur in the courſe of our narrative.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="unknown:036237_0165_1008A43AF5D19298"/>Though a conſiderable number of planters was cut off by the diſeaſes prevalent in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo imperfectly cultivated by its original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as to be ſtill almoſt one continued foreſt, and ſeveral, diſcouraged by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to which they were expoſed, returned to England (1632) recruits ſufficient to replace them arrived. At the ſame time the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, a diſtemper fatal to the people of the New World, ſwept away ſuch multitudes of the natives that ſome whole tribes diſappeared; and Heaven, by thus evacuating a country in which the Engliſh might ſettle without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, was ſuppoſed to declare its intention that they ſhould occupy it.</p>
            <p>As ſeveral of the vacant Indian ſtations were well choſen, ſuch was the eagerneſs of the Engliſh to take poſſeſſion of them, that their ſettlements became more numerous and more widely diſperſed than ſuited the condition of an infant colony. This led to an innovation which totally altered the nature and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the government. When a general court was to be held in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty-four, the freemen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of attending it in perſon as the charter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, elected repreſentatives in their different diſtricts, authorizing them to appear in their name, with full power to deliberate and decide concerning every point that fell under the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:036237_0166_1008A43C9DCA01D0"/>
of the general court. Whether this meaſure was ſuggeſted by ſome deſigning lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or whether they found it prudent to ſooth the people by complying with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, is uncertain. The repreſentatives were admitted; and conſidered themſelves, in conjunction with the governor and aſſiſtants, as the ſupreme legiſlative aſſembly of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. In aſſertion of their own rights they enacted, that no law ſhould be paſſed, no tax ſhould be impoſed, and no public officer ſhould be appointed, but in the general aſſembly. The pretexts for making this new arrangement were plauſible. The number of freemen was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed; many reſided at a diſtance from the places where the ſupreme courts were held; perſonal attendance became inconvenient; the form of government in their own country had rendered familiar the idea of delegating their rights, and committing the guardianſhip of their liberties, to repreſentatives of their own choice, and the experience of ages had taught them that this important truſt might with ſafety be lodged in their hands. Thus did the company of Maſſachuſetts Bay, in leſs than ſix years from its incorporation by the king, mature and perfect a ſcheme which, I have already obſerved, ſome of its more artful and aſpiring leaders ſeem to have had in view when the aſſociation for peopling New England was firſt formed. The colony muſt henceforward

be conſidered, not as a corporation whoſe powers were defined, and its mode of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure regulated by its charter, but as a ſociety, which, having acquired or aſſumed political liberty, had, by its own voluntary deed, adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſtitution or government framed on the model of that in England.</p>
            <p>But however liberal their ſyſtem of civil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy might be, as their religious opinions were no longer under any reſtraint of authority, the ſpirit of fanaticiſm continued to ſpread, and became every day wilder and more extravagant. Williams, a miniſter of Salem, in high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, having conceived an antipathy to the Croſs of St. George in the ſtandard of England, declaimed againſt it with ſo much vehemence as a relic of ſuperſtition and idolatry, which ought not to be retained among a people ſo pure and ſanctified, that Endicot, one of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the court of aſſiſtants, in a tranſport of zeal, publicly cut out the Croſs from the enſign diſplayed before the governor's gate. This frivolous matter intereſted and divided the colony. Some of the militia ſcrupled to follow colours in which there was a Croſs, leſt they ſhould do honour to an idol; others refuſed to ſerve under a mutilated banner, leſt they ſhould be ſuſpected of having renounced their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the crown of England. After a long controverſy, carried on by both parties with
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:036237_0168_1008A44368D29F60"/>
that heat and zeal which in trivial diſputes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of argument, the conteſt was terminated by a compromiſe. The Croſs was retained in the enſigns of forts and ſhips, but eraſed from the colours of the militia. Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams, on account of this, as well as of ſome other doctrines deemed unſound, was baniſhed out of the colony.<note n="*" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſt. of N.

            <p>The proſperous ſtate of New England was now ſo highly extolled, and the ſimple frame of its eccleſiaſtic policy was ſo much admired by all whoſe affections were eſtranged from the church of England, that crowds of new ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers flocked thither (1635).

His mortified appearance, his demure look, and rigid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, carried even beyond the ſtandard of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs in that ſociety which he joined, ſeemed to indicate a man of high ſpiritual attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, while his abilities and addreſs in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pointed him out as worthy of the higheſt ſtation in the community. With univerſal conſent, and high expectations of advantage from his adminiſtration, he was elected gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in the year (1636) ſubſequent to his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. But as the affairs of an infant colony afforded not objects adequate to the talents of Vane, his buſy pragmatical ſpirit occupied it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with theological ſubtilties and ſpeculations unworthy of his attention. Theſe were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by a woman, whoſe reveries produced ſuch effects, both within the colony and beyond its precincts, that, frivolous as they may now appear, they muſt be mentioned as an occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of importance in its hiſtory.</p>
            <p>It was the cuſtom at that time in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, among the chief men in every congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to meet once a week, in order to repeat the ſermons which they had heard, and to hold religious conference with reſpect to the doctrine contained in them. Mrs. Hutchinſon, whoſe huſband was among the moſt reſpectable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the colony, regretting that perſons of her ſex were excluded from the benefit of thoſe

meetings, aſſembled ſtatedly in her houſe a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of women, who employed themſelves in pious exerciſes ſimilar to thoſe of the men. At firſt ſhe ſatisfied herſelf with repeating what ſhe could recollect of the diſcourſes delivered by their teachers. She began afterwards to add illuſtrations, and at length proceeded to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſome of the clergy as unſound, and to vent opinions and fancies of her own. Theſe were all founded on the ſyſtem which is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Antinomian by divines, and tinged with the deepeſt enthuſiaſm. She taught, that ſanctity of life is no evidence of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of a ſtate of favour with God; and that ſuch as inculcated the neceſſity of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting the reality of our faith by obedience, preached only a covenant of works; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the ſpirit of God dwelt perſonally in good men, and by inward revelations and impreſſions they received the fulleſt diſcoveries of the divine will. The fluency and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with which ſhe delivered theſe notions gained her many admirers and proſelytes, not only among the vulgar, but among the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal inhabitants. The whole colony was inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted and agitated. Vane, whoſe ſagacity and acuteneſs ſeemed to forſake him whenever they were turned towards religion, eſpouſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her wildeſt tenets. Many conferences were held (1637) days of faſting and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation were appointed, a general ſynod was
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:036237_0171_1008A44A52CF3B38"/>
called, and, after diſſentions ſo violent as threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the diſſolution of the colony, Mrs. Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinſon's opinions were condemned as erroneous, and ſhe herſelf baniſhed. Several of her diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples withdrew from the province of their own accord. Vane quitted America in diſguſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamented even by thoſe who had lately admired him; ſome of whom regarded him now as a mere viſionary, and others as one of thoſe dark turbulent ſpirits doomed to embroil every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety into which they enter.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mather, book vii. c. 3.

            <p>However much theſe theological conteſts might diſquiet the colony of Maſſachuſetts Bay, they contributed to the more ſpeedy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of America. When Williams was baniſhed from Salem in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty-four, ſuch was the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of his hearers to a paſtor whoſe piety they revered, that a good number of them vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily accompanied him in his exile. They directed their march towards the ſouth; and having purchaſed from the natives a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tract of land, to which Williams gave the name of Providence, they ſettled there.

iſland in Naraganſet Bay, which acquired the name of Rhode Iſland. Williams remained among them upwards of forty years, reſpected as the father and the guide of the colony which he had planted. His ſpirit differed from that of the Puritans in Maſſachuſetts; it was mild and tolerating; and having ventured himſelf to reject eſtabliſhed opinions, he endeavoured to ſecure the ſame liberty to other men, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, that the exerciſe of private judgment was a natural and ſacred right; that the civil magiſtrate has no compulſive juriſdiction in the concerns of religion; that the puniſhment of any perſon on account of his opinions, was an encroachment on conſcience, and an act of perſecution.<note n="*" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſt. of N. Eng. p. 141.</note> Theſe humane principles he inſtilled into his followers; and all who felt or dreaded oppreſſion in other ſettlements, reſorted to a community in which univerſal toleration was known to be a fundamental maxim. In the plantations of Providence and Rhode Iſland, political union was eſtabliſhed by voluntary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, and the equality of condition among the members, as well as their religious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; their form of government was purely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical, the ſupreme power being lodged in the freemen perſonally aſſembled.

The rivalſhip between Mr. Cotton and Mr. Hooker, two favourite miniſters in the ſettlement of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets Bay, diſpoſed the latter, who was leaſt ſucceſsful in this conteſt for fame and power, to wiſh for ſome ſettlement at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from a competitor by whom his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was eclipſed. A good number of thoſe who had imbibed Mrs. Hutchinſon's noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and were offended at ſuch as combated them, offered to accompany him. Having employed proper perſons to explore the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they pitched upon the weſt ſide of the great river Connecticut as the moſt inviting ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty-ſix, about an hundred perſons, with their wives and families, after a fatiguing march of many days through woods and ſwamps, arrived there, and laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the towns of Hartford, Springfield, and Weatherfield. This ſettlement was attended with peculiar irregularities. Part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict now occupied lay beyond the limits of the territory granted to the colony of Maſſachuſets Bay, and yet the emigrants took a commiſſion from the governor and court of aſſiſtants, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering them to exerciſe juriſdiction in that country. The Dutch from Manhados or New York, having diſcovered the river Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, and eſtabliſhed ſome trading houſes
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:036237_0174_1008A4527422AE00"/>
upon it, had acquired all the right that prior poſſeſſion confers. Lord Say and Sele, and Lord Brooke, the heads of two illuſtrious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, were ſo much alarmed at the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meaſures of Charles I. both in his civil and eccleſiaſtical adminiſtration, that they took a reſolution, not unbecoming young men of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble birth and liberal ſentiments, of retiring to the New World, in order to enjoy ſuch a form of religion as they approved of, and thoſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they deemed eſſential to the well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſociety. They, too, fixed on the banks of the Connecticut as their place of ſettlement, and had taken poſſeſſion, by building a fort at the mouth of the river, which, from their united names, was called Say Brook. The emigrants from Maſſachuſets, without regarding either the defects in their own right or the pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other claimants, kept poſſeſſion, and proceeded with vigour to clear and cultivate the country. By degrees they got rid of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry competitor. The Dutch, recently ſettled in America, and too feeble to engage in a war, peaceably withdrew from Connecticut. Lord Say and Sele, and Lord Brook, made over to the colony whatever title they might have to any lands in that region.

            <p>The hiſtory of the firſt attempts to people the provinces of New Hampſhire and Main, which form the fourth and moſt extenſive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in New England, is obſcure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, by the interfering claims of various proprietors. The company of Plymouth had inconſiderately parcelled out the northern part of the territory contained in its grant among different perſons: Of theſe only Sir Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Gorges and Captain Maſon ſeem to have had any ſerious intention to occupy the lands allotted to them. Their efforts to accompliſh this were meritorious and perſevering, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful. The expence of ſettling colonies in an uncultivated country muſt neceſſarily be great and immediate; the proſpect of a return is often uncertain and always remote. The funds of two private adventurers were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate to ſuch an undertaking. Nor did the planters whom they ſent out poſſeſs that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of enthuſiaſm, which animated their neighbours of Maſſachuſets with vigour, to
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:036237_0176_1008A4580D68ADA0"/>
ſtruggle through all the hardſhips and dangers to which ſociety, in its infancy, is expoſed in a ſavage land. Gorges and Maſon, it is probable, muſt have abandoned their deſign, if, from the ſame motives that ſettlements had been made in Rhode Iſland and Connecticut, coloniſts had not unexpectedly migrated into New Hampſhire and Main. Mr. Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, a miniſter of ſome note, nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to Mrs. Hutchinſon, and one of her moſt fervent admirers and partiſans, had, on this account, been baniſhed from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Maſſachuſetts Bay.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon, p. 70.</note> In queſt of a new ſtation, he took a courſe oppoſite to the other exiles; and advancing towards the north, founded the town of Exeter, on a ſmall river flowing into Piſkataqua Bay. His followers, few in number, but firmly united, were of ſuch rigid principles, that even the churches of Maſſachuſetts did not appear to them ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently pure. From time to time they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome recruits, whom love of novelty, or diſſatisfaction with the eccleſiaſtical inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the other colonies, prompted to join them. Their plantations were widely diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but the country was thinly peopled, and its political ſtate extremely unſettled.

within the limits of their grant. Gorges and Maſon aſſerted the rights conveyed to them as proprietors by their charter. In ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſtricts, the planters, without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pretenſions of either party, governed themſelves by maxims and laws copied from thoſe of their brethren in the adjacent colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon, p. 103, &amp;c. 176.

            <p>By extending their ſettlements, the Engliſh became expoſed to new danger. The tribes of Indians around Maſſachuſetts Bay were feeble and unwarlike; yet from regard to juſtice, as well as motives of prudence, the firſt coloniſts were ſtudious to obtain the conſent of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives before they ventured to occupy any of their lands; and though in ſuch tranſactions the conſideration given was often very inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the value of the territory acquired, it was ſufficient to ſatisfy the demands of the proprietors. The Engliſh took quiet poſſeſſion of the lands thus conveyed to them, and no open hoſtility broke out between them and the ancient poſſeſſors. But the colonies of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Connecticut ſoon found that they were ſurrounded by more powerful and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:036237_0178_1008A45CADFA2FF8"/>
nations. Among theſe the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable were the Naraganſets and Pequods; the former ſeated on the Bay which bears their name, and the latter occupying the territory which ſtretches from the river Pequod along the banks of the Connecticut. The Pequods were a formidable people, who could bring into the field a thouſand warriors, not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in courage to any in the New World. They foreſaw, not only that the extermination of the Indian race muſt be the conſequence of permitting the Engliſh to ſpread over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of America, but that if meaſures were not ſpeedily concerted to prevent it, the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity would be unavoidable. With this view they applied to the Narraganſets, requeſting them to forget ancient animoſities for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to co-operate with them in expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a common enemy who threatened both with deſtruction. They repreſented that, when thoſe ſtrangers firſt landed, the object of their viſit was not ſuſpected, and no proper precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were taken to check their progreſs; that now, by ſending out colonies in one year to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards three different quarters, their intentions were manifeſt, and the people of America muſt abandon their native ſeats to make way for unjuſt intruders.</p>

rivals, and there ſubſiſted between them an hereditary and implacable enmity. Revenge is the darling paſſion of ſavages; in order to ſecure the indulgence of which there is no preſent advantage that they will not ſacrifice, and no future conſequence which they do not totally diſregard. The Naraganſets, inſtead of cloſing with the prudent propoſal of their neighbours, diſcovered their hoſtile intentions to the governor of Maſſachuſetts Bay; and, eager to lay hold on ſuch a favourable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of wreaking their vengeance on their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient foes, entered into an alliance with the Engliſh againſt them. The Pequods, more exaſperated than diſcouraged by the imprudence and treachery of their countrymen, took the field, and carried on the war in the uſual mode of Americans. They ſurpriſed ſtragg]ers, and ſcalped them; they plundered and burnt remote ſettlements; they attacked Fort Say Brook without ſucceſs, though garriſoned only by twenty men; and when the Engliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to act offenſively, they retired to faſtneſſes which they deemed inacceſſible. The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colonies had agreed to unite againſt the common enemy, each furniſhing a quota of men in proportion to its numbers. The troops of Connecticut which lay moſt expoſed to danger were ſoon aſſembled. The march of thoſe from Maſſachuſets, which formed the moſt conſiderable body, was retarded by the
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:036237_0180_1008A462515A0440"/>
moſt ſingular cauſe that ever influenced the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of a military force. When they were muſtered previous to their departure, it was found that ſome of the officers, as well as of the private ſoldiers, were ſtill under a covenant of works; and that the bleſſing of God could not be implored or expected to crown the arms of ſuch unhallowed men with ſucceſs. The alarm was general, and many arrangements neceſſary in order to caſt out the unclean, and to render this little band ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently pure to fight the battles of a people who entertained high ideas of their own ſanctity.<note n="*" place="bottom">Neal, i. 168</note>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile the Connecticut troops, reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a ſmall detachment from Say Brook, found it neceſſary to advance towards the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. They were poſted on a riſing ground, in the middle of a ſwamp towards the head of the river Miſtick, which they had ſurrounded with paliſadoes, the beſt defence that their ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſkill in the art of fortification had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Though they knew that the Engliſh were in motion, yet, with the uſual improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſecurity of ſavages, they took no meaſures either to obſerve their progreſs, or to guard againſt being ſurpriſed themſelves. The enemy (May 20) unperceived, reached the paliſadoes, and if a dog had not given the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:036237_0181_1008A464DAE93C88"/>
alarm by barking, the Indians muſt have been maſſacred without reſiſtance. In a moment, however they ſtarted to arms, and raiſing the war-cry, prepared to repel the aſſailants. But at that early period of their intercourſe with the Europeans, the Americans were little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the uſe of gunpowder, and dreaded its effects extremely. While ſome of the Engliſh galled them with an inceſſant fire through the intervals between the paliſadoes, others forced their way by the entries into the fort, filled only with branches of trees; and ſetting fire to the huts which were covered with reeds, the confuſion and terror quickly became general. Many of the women and children periſhed in the flames; and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, in endeavouring to eſcape, were either ſlain by the Engliſh, or falling into the hands of their Indian allies, who ſurrounded the fort at a diſtance, were reſerved for a more cruel fate. After the junction of the troops from Maſſachuſetts, the Engliſh reſolved to purſue their victory; and hunting the Indians from one place of retreat to another, ſome ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent encounters were hardly leſs fatal to them than the action on the Miſtick. In leſs than three months the tribe of Pequods was extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated: A few miſerable fugitives who took re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge among the neighbouring Indians, being incorporated by them, loſt their name as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct people. In this firſt eſſay of their arms,

the coloniſts of New England ſeem to have been conducted by ſkilful and enterpriſing offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and diſplayed both courage and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as ſoldiers. But they ſtained their laurels by the uſe which they made of victory. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of treating the Pequods as an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent people, who made a gallant effort to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the property, the rights, and the freedom of their nation, they retaliated upon them all the barbarities of American war. Some they maſſacred in cold blood, others they gave up to be tortured by their Indian allies, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number they ſold as ſlaves in Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, the reſt were reduced to ſervitude among themſelves.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon, p. 58, 76, &amp;c.

            <p>But reprehenſible as this conduct of the Engliſh muſt be deemed, their vigorous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in this deciſive campaign filled all the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding tribes of Indians with ſuch an high opinion of their valour, as ſecured a long tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity to all their ſettlements.

World, which hitherto preſented to them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could allure them thither but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from oppreſſion. The number of thoſe emigrants drew the attention of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and appeared ſo formidable, that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was iſſued, prohibiting maſters of ſhips from carrying paſſengers to New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land without ſpecial permiſſion.

by a great body of the people as ſo hoſtile to thoſe rights which they deemed moſt valuable, that in the courſe of the year one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty-eight, above three thouſand perſons embarked for New England, chooſing rather to expoſe themſelves to all the conſequences of diſregarding the royal procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, than to remain longer under oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Exaſperated at this contempt of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Charles had recourſe to a violent but effectual mode of accompliſhing what he had in view. A writ of <hi>quo warranto</hi> was iſſued againſt the corporation of Maſſachuſetts Bay. The coloniſts had conformed ſo little to the terms of their charter, that judgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt them without difficulty. They were found to have forfeited all their rights as a corporation, which of courſe returned to the crown, and Charles began to take meaſures for new modelling the political frame of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and veſting the adminiſtration of its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in other hands. But his plans were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carried into execution. In every corner of his dominions, the ſtorm now began to gather, which ſoon burſt out with ſuch fatal violence, that Charles, during the remainder of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate reign, occupied with domeſtic and more intereſting cares, had not leiſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow any attention upon a remote and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable province.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon, p. 86, 502, &amp;c.

               <pb n="189" facs="unknown:036237_0185_1008A46FBA4C58D0"/>On the meeting of the Long Parliament, ſuch a revolution took place in England, that all the motives for migrating to the New World ceaſed. The maxims of the Puritans with reſpect to the government both of church and ſtate, became predominant in the nation, and were enforced by the hand of power. Their oppreſſors were humbled; that perfect ſyſtem of reformed polity, which had long been the object of their admiration and deſire, was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by law; and amidſt the intrigues and conflicts of an obſtinate civil war, turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and aſpiring ſpirits found ſuch full occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, that they had no inducement to quit a buſy theatre, on which they had riſen to act a moſt conſpicuous part. From the year one thouſand ſix hundred and twenty, when the firſt feeble colony was conducted to New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by the Browniſts, to the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and forty, it has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, that twenty-one thouſand two hundred Britiſh ſubjects had ſettled there. The money expended by various adventurers during that period in fitting out ſhips, in purchaſing ſtock, and tranſporting ſettlers, amounted, on a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate calculation, nearly to two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds;<note n="*" place="bottom">Mather, b. i. ch. 4. p. 17. ch. 5. p. 23. Hutchinſon, p. 193. Chalmers' Annals, p. 165.</note> a vaſt ſum in that age, and which no principles, inferior in force to thoſe wherewith the Puritans were animated, could
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:036237_0186_1008A4725AD8CD80"/>
have perſuaded men to lay out, on the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proſpect of obtaining an eſtabliſhment in a remote uncultivated region, which, from its ſituation and climate, could allure them with no hope but that of finding ſubſiſtence and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying freedom. For ſome years, even ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence was procured with difficulty; and it was towards the cloſe of the period to which our narrative is arrived, before the product of the ſettlement yielded the planters any return for their ſtock. About that time they began to export corn in ſmall quantities to the Weſt Indies, and made ſome feeble attempts to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the fiſhery, and to open the trade in lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which have ſince proved the ſtaple arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of commerce in the colony.* Since the year one thouſand ſix hundred and forty, the number of people with which New England has recruited the population of the parent ſtate, is ſuppoſed at leaſt to equal what may have been drained from it by occaſional migrations thither.</p>
            <p>But though the ſudden change of ſyſtem in Great Britain ſtopt entirely the influx of ſettlers into New England, the principles of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts coincided ſo perfectly with thoſe of the popular leaders in parliament, that they were ſoon diſtinguiſhed by peculiar marks of their
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:036237_0187_1008A47628690820"/>
brotherly affection. By a vote of the Houſe of Commons in the year one thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty-two, the people in all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent plantations of New England were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from payment of any duties, either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goods exported thither, or upon thoſe which they imported into the mother country, until the Houſe ſhall take farther order to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This was afterwards confirmed by the authority of both Houſes. Encouraged by ſuch an extraordinary privilege, induſtry made rapid progreſs in all the diſtricts of New England (1646) and population increaſed along with it. In return for thoſe favours, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts applauded the meaſures of parliament, celebrated its generous efforts to vindicate the rights and liberties of the nation, prayed for the ſucceſs of its arms, and framed regulations in order to prevent any exertion in favour of the king on the other ſide of the Atlantic.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 114.

            <p>Relying on the indulgent partiality with which all their proceedings were viewed by men thus cloſely united with them in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and wiſhes, the people of New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ventured on a meaſure, which not only increaſed their ſecurity and power, but may be regarded as a conſiderable ſtep towards inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.

He endeavoured to rouſe their religious zeal by repreſenting what a fatal blow it would be to the man of ſin, if a colony of the faithful were ſettled in the midſt of his territories in the new world.
