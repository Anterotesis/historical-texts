            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>We may conſider the Duty here required; Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under this Head I would ſpeak briefly to the following Particulars. 1. Who is our Neighbour? 2. What is implied in loving our Neighbour? 3. In loving him as our ſelves?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Who is our Neighbour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. (1.) <hi>Every Man without Diſtinction of Nation, or outward Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Love is not to be confin'd to our Friends and Benefactors, or thoſe of our own Nation, as the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> taught. The carnal <hi>Jews</hi> were ready to imagine that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not included in this Precept. But our great Lord and Lawgiver, in Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Who is my Neighbour?</hi> plainly ſheweth us that every one is our Neighbour, and that we muſt extend our Charity to all, of what Nation ſoever, as we have Opportunity. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.29, —36, 37. <hi>Which now of theſe three, thinkeſt thou, was Neighbour unto him that fell among Thieves? And he ſaid, He that ſhewed Mercy on him. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Go, and do thou likewiſe.</hi> It hath pleaſed GOD of one Blood to make all Nations that dwell upon the Earth. We were all one in <hi>Adam,</hi> who was our firſt Father, and our Head and Repreſentative in the firſt Covenant: He was created in the Image of GOD, and altho' by his firſt Tranſgreſſion we forfeited and loſt that <hi>moral Rectitude</hi> in which the Image of GOD principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, yet ſtill Man retains ſomething of that Image, as he is a Spirit, tho' in Fleſh. And agreeably one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Murther is puniſh'd with Death by the divine Law, we have given, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Whoſe ſheddeth Man's Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood he ſhed; For in the Image
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005056_0005_101692AF44C4F668"/>
of God made he Man.</hi> And then, we were, in the Loins of our Progenitors, preſerved in the <hi>Ark,</hi> when other Families of Renown in the Earth, ſunk under the Weight of GOD's Wrath in the Deluge, and have their Names blotted out from under Heaven: And that in a particular Manner for their Violation of this Command. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.11. <hi>The Earth alſo was corrupt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD; and the Earth was filled with Violence.</hi> And to riſe higher ſtill, the Son of GOD became Man, and has bought a People with his Blood out of every Tongue and Tribe and Nation. We muſt therefore love, and do good to all Men. And one Way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to expreſs our good Will to them that are unknown, and far from us; is by praying for them to that GOD who fills Heaven and Earth. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men.</hi> Thus we ſhould expreſs our Charity for the Jews and Heathen-Gentile Nations, by looking up to GOD for them, that He would be pleaſed to ſend forth his Light and Truth, and ſo give them the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelf, as manifeſted in the Face of JESUS CHRIST. Thus the Pſalmiſt prays to GOD, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 67.2, 3. <hi>That thy Way may be known upon Earth, and thy ſaving Health among all Nations. Let the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Praiſe thee, O GOD; let all the People praiſe thee.</hi> And we muſt take heed we do not attend this Duty whether in public or private, after a formal cuſtomary Manner; but that with holy Fervency we thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our earneſt Deſires of the Advancement of GOD's Glory, and of the Salvation of our Fellow-Creatures. There is a general <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> or Love of Men, which is a Duty that extends to all. We muſt treat Men, tho' ever ſo mean in their outward Condition and Circumſtances, with Humanity; and not like Beaſts. Certainly then, it muſt be a dreadful Violation of this Law for Men to take more Care of their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005056_0006_101692B2DE3EF738"/>
and other Brute Creatures, than of the Souls and Bodies of their Servants, tho' in ever ſo low a Degree of Servitude. And then I may here obſerve that this Law of Love reacheth even to our perſonal Enemies. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 43, 44. <hi>Ye have heard that it bath been ſaid, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine Enemy: But I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi> The Roman Orator and Moraliſt <hi>Tully,</hi> has this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "It is the firſt Duty of Juſtice to hurt no Man, unleſs provoked by Injury.<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſtitiae primum munus eſt, ut ne cui quis noceat, niſi Caceſſitus injuria. <hi>Tullius de Officiis.</hi> P. 10</note> How divinely excellent are the Laws of Christ, and how far do they excel the moſt refined Heathen Morality! Chriſtians are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to do good even to them from whom they ſuffer Evil. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 21. <hi>Be not overcome of Evil, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Evil with Good.</hi> Indeed this doth not require us to love ſuch evil ones with a Love of Complacency, but with a Love of Benevolence. Tho' we are juſtly offended, yet we muſt maintain good Will and a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Diſpoſition towards ſuch, wiſhing well to them, and being ready to do them good as we have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Lord write this Law upon our Hearts!</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Such are our Neighbours in an eſpecial Manner, as ſtand in any peculiar Relation to us, whether natural, civil or religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Neighbour is one that is nigh to us. Agreeably, as ſome Perſons are in a peculiar Senſe near to us, ſo they may in an eſpecial Manner be call'd our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the Senſe of my Text; and there is a peculiar Love which by God's Law we are obliged to exerciſe towards them. Thus Parents ought to love their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſeek the Well-being of their Offspring,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005056_0007_101692B6B2C924F8"/>
with a tender Affection. And <hi>Children</hi> muſt with a dutiful Affection conſult the beſt good of their <hi>Parents,</hi> and labour by their kind and reſpectful Behaviour to be Bleſſings to them. <hi>Brethren and Siſters</hi> muſt labour to be of one Heart, and to dwell together in Unity. It is named as an abominable Iniquity, to be <hi>without natural Affection,</hi> Rom. 1. 31. Such as are united by the <hi>Bonds of Nature</hi> are then under peculiar Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to love one another. The like may be ſaid reſpecting ſuch as are nigh to each other in a <hi>civil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> There ought to be a ſingular Love and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment between <hi>Huſbands and Wives,</hi> who are <hi>one Fleſh</hi> in the neareſt Union by God's Ordinance. How divine is the Example ſet before Huſbands to this Purpoſe in the pure and ardent Love of Christ to his myſtical Body, the Church! <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, love your Wives, even as CHRIST alſo loved the Church.</hi> Thus <hi>Maſters</hi> ought in the Exerciſe of Love to give unto their <hi>Servants</hi> that which is juſt and equal. They ought to perform their Covenant Agreements with Equity and a kind Diſpoſition to do them all the Good they can. And <hi>Servants</hi> muſt be obedient to their Maſters, not with Eye-Service as Men pleaſers, but as the Servants of Christ, doing the Will of God from the Heart; <hi>with good Will doing Service.</hi> Eph. 6.5, —7. Their Service muſt not be meerly of Conſtraint, but from good Will and a Principle of Love to their Maſters. They muſt regard their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Intereſts ſomething as their own, and ſo promote them by their honeſt diligent Labour. Thus there ought to be mutual Affection between <hi>Civil Rulers,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> under their Government. Rulers ought to lay out themſelves in promoting the public Weal. They muſt be the Miniſters of God for good to their People, and uſe their beſt Endeavours that they may be extenſive Bleſſings, as the Light and Rain of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And the People ſhould chearfully return that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005056_0008_101692B841D02068"/>
Honour and Obedience, Tribute and Recompence which are their Due; and do their Part by their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Reſpect and dutiful Deportment to make the Burden Of Government as eaſy to their Rulers as may be. I might go on, and ſay that there is alſo a peculiar Love to be exerciſed towards ſuch as are related to us upon a <hi>religious Account,</hi> and by the Bonds of Grace. <hi>Paſtors</hi> ſhould feed their <hi>Flocks</hi> with tender Care and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being willing to ſpend and be ſpent for them, tho' the more abundantly they love them, the leſs they be loved. And their <hi>People</hi> ſhould highly eſteem them in Love for their Work's ſake. Such as are <hi>united in Church-Fellowſhip</hi> ſhould watch over one another in Love, not for their halting, but ſpiritual Edification; rejoicing in the Proſperity of each other's Souls. Such as are Brethren in Christ ſhould love each other from a pure Heart, fervently. The Saints ſhould in our Eſteem be the excellent ones of the Earth, and we ſhould place our Affection in an eſpecial Manner upon thoſe in whom the Image of God ſhineth with the brighteſt Luſtre. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>To the Saints that are in the Earth, and to the excellent in whom is all my delight.</hi> Our Love muſt be <hi>extenſive,</hi> and as we have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, we <hi>muſt do good to all Men;</hi> but then here it muſt be more <hi>intenſe,</hi> and we muſt accordingly <hi>do good eſpecially to them who are of the Houſhold of Faith,</hi> Gal. 6. 10. And thus I have briefly anſwer'd the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; who is our Neighbour?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What is implied in loving our Neighbour?</hi> Or, <hi>What is this Love?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw <hi>This Love is a gracious Affection, by which we truly deſire, ſeek and rejoice in the Welfare of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and that in Obedience to GOD's Command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>This Love to our Neighbour is a gracious Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005056_0009_101692BAF0F13C60"/>It is not meerly a natural Paſſion. No, this Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be ſanctified by the Holy Spirit of God. <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit is Love,</hi> Gal. 5. 22. Not only Love to God, but alſo to our Neighbour. We muſt be made Partakers of the divine Teaching, that we may obey this Command. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Ye your ſelves are taught of GOD to love one another.</hi> God writes this Law of Love upon the Heart when his People are born again, born of the Spirit. Thus ſays the beloved Diſciple <hi>John,</hi> 1 Ep. 4. 7. <hi>Beloved, let us love one another: For Love is of GOD; and every one that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, is born of GOD.</hi> Alas! by our Fall this Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is dreadfully deprav'd, ſo that Men inordinately love themſelves, and are full of Malice and Envy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Neighbour. We have that Deſcription of the natural Man deſtitute of the Grace of the Goſpel, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Living in Malice and Envy, hateful, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another.</hi> So it was till the Kindneſs and Love of God our Saviour towards Man appear'd, and they <hi>were ſaved by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 4th and 5th Verſes.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This Love is exerciſed in Obedience to GOD's Command.</p>
            <p>God's Commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf.</hi> The Command of our Redeemer, God-Man Mediator is that, <hi>Love one another.</hi> Now he that loveth his Neighbour, hath a ſincere Reſpect to the Divine Command, as the Cauſe, Rule and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Love to his Neighbour. He loveth his Brother becauſe the great Lawgiver requireth it, for the Lord's ſake, who is the chief Good; and with an upright Aim at his Glory, who is the laſt and higheſt End. He loves the Diſciples of Christ upon the Account of their Relation to him, and becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth them to love one another. In a Word, ſuch as truly love their Neighbour, endeavour to regulate
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005056_0010_101692BCE9E81E70"/>
their Love, the inward Affection and outward Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it, by the Rule of GOD'S Word. Whereas, tho' wicked Men may have a ſtrong Affection towards their Children and Friends; yet they have not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Reſpect to GOD's Law as the Reaſon and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Love: But indeed they forget GOD, while they make an Idol of the Creature.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) In the Exerciſe of this Love <hi>we ſincerely deſire the Good and Welfare of our Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we conſider'd the Love of GOD, we menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned our deſiring him above all; for He is infinitely glorious, and altogether lovely; and there's no Room for us ſo much as to wiſh him more excellent and happy than He is in himſelf. But our Neighbour is like our ſelves, a needy imperfect dependent Creature: And therefore we may not deſire him above all, or place our Happineſs in him; but then we muſt deſire his Good: There muſt be a Love of Benevolence, of good Will exerciſed towards him. We muſt be well affected towards him, and heartily wiſh that his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, and more eſpecially that his Soul may proſper. And we muſt be ready as there may be Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to expreſs our Deſires and good Wiſhes in hearty Prayer to GOD for him, eſpecially for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Soul. 3 Joh. 2. <hi>Beloved, I wiſh above all Things that thou mayſt proſper and be in Health, even as thy Soul proſpereth.</hi> This is a genuine Fruit of Love, and will be accepted of GOD, even when we are able, to do but little for our Neighbour. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 22. <hi>The Deſire of a Man is his Kindneſs: and a poor Man is better than a Liar.</hi> A Man may expreſs real Kindneſs in good Deſires: And ſuch as breath out their good Wiſhes for GOD's People in frequent and fervent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are indeed public Bleſſings, tho' ever ſo mean and obſcure in the World. But then we muſt take heed we be not as the <hi>Liar</hi> in the Text but now mentioned,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005056_0011_101692BEACDA19F8"/>
who pretends Love, but will be at no Pains and Coſt to ſhew it by his good Works, when he is well able.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) In the Exerciſe of this Love, <hi>we ſeek our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Good, and avoid whatever would hurt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Joh. 3. 18. <hi>Let us not love in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth.</hi> As true Love deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Good of others, ſo it will incline us to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it, and as we have Ability and Opportunity, to promote it. In the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. among other excellent Characters of Charity or Love, we have that, 5th ver. <hi>Charity ſeeketh not her own.</hi> Not what is for our own Good only; but alſo the Profit and Advantage of others. And therefore he that hath this Grace in due Exerciſe, will obey that Command, 1 Cor. 10. 24. <hi>Let no Man ſeek his own: but every Man another's Wealth.</hi> We muſt ſeek the Wealth of our Neighbour in Trade and Commerce, as well as our Own; and take heed we do not over-reach and defraud him. That muſt be a vicious Self-love indeed which would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs all Advantage and Profit to itſelf. Love will incline Perſons to ſeek the Good of their Neighbours on ſpiritual and temporal Accounts. He that duly exerciſeth this Grace will regard the Soul of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his better part. He will as he hath Opportunity ſeek his Converſion to GOD, knowing that he which converteth a Sinner from the Error of his Way, ſhall ſave a Soul from Death. He will alſo ſeek his Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Holineſs by his Inſtructions, Exhortations, Counſels, and the like, as he is able, and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Circumſtances call for them. If he beholds his Brother fallen into Sin, he will mourn for it. <hi>Charity rejoiceth not in Iniquity.</hi> And inſtead of going about to expoſe him, he will rather ſeek to reſtore him with a Spirit of Meekneſs, by brotherly Admonition and Reproof. Lev. 19. 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thine Heart: Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005056_0012_101692C4F592B0F0"/>
Neighbour, and not ſuffer Sin upon him.</hi> And then the Fruit of Love will be a ſincere Endeavour to promote the outward Good of our Neighbour: Love would incline us to pity him under his Diſtreſſes, and to do what we can to relieve and ſuccour him. <hi>Job</hi> 6. 14. <hi>To him that is afflicted Pity ſhould be ſhewed from his Friend.</hi> If our Neighbour be poor, Love will open our Hearts and Hands to relieve him: In the Exerciſe of this Grace we ſhall <hi>draw out our Soul to the hungry, and ſatisfy the afflicted Soul.</hi> True Love is beneficent and communicative. And then, where there is this lovely Grace in any due Exerciſe, we ſhall carefully avoid whatever would hurt and injure our Neighbour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his Life, his Chaſtity, his Eſtate, good Name, and the like. <hi>Charity thinketh no Evil.</hi> Such will not be forward to entertain evil Surmiſes and hard Tho'ts of their Neighbour; but will rather be ready to put the moſt favourable Conſtruction on their Words and Actions which the Matter will bear. To be ſure then they will not go about as Tale-bearers and Backbiters to ſow Diſcord between Brethren, and privily to wound their Neighbour. Rom. 13. 10. <hi>Love worketh no ill to his Neighbour.</hi> This excellent Grace is pure and peaceable, and will incline us to follow Peace, ſuch as is conſiſtent with Truth and Holineſs. Rom. 12. 18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all Men.</hi> Again, as Charity is not eaſily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; ſo it is early in ſeeking Reconciliation, and doth not meditate Revenge. They obey that Word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 31, 32. <hi>Let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and evil ſpeaking be put far away from you, with all Malice. And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as GOD for CHRIST's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> In a Word, where this Grace rules in the Heart, we ſhall avoid every thing whereby our Brother is offended, or is made weak; and ſhall endeavour ſo to behave in our ſeveral
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005056_0013_101692C6A1AE5468"/>
Places and Relations, that ſuch as are near to us may be the better for us, and none have Reaſon to mourn becauſe we are nigh to them in this or the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) In the Exerciſe of Love <hi>we rejoice in the Good and Welfare of our Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Delight in his Perſon ſo far as he is truly lovely, and according to the Relation we ſtand in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; which is a Duty: But I now mention that which is more general. True Love will incline us to be well affected to our Neighbour, and not allow us to have an evil Eye towards him, becauſe GOD is good to him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>Charity envieth not.</hi> It is true, there are the Remains of Corruption in the beſt, which incline them to luſt unto Envy; but then ſo far as this Grace prevails, it will ſuppreſs theſe evil Motions, and cauſe us to rejoice in the Good of our Neighbour. He that ſincerely loveth his Brother, will obey that Command, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 15. <hi>Rejoice with them that do rejoice.</hi> Such will feel an holy Joy, eſpecially in the ſpiritual Welfare and Proſperity of others. 3 Joh. 4. <hi>I have no greater Joy than to hear that my Children walk in the Truth.</hi> A kind and charitable Spirit takes Pleaſure in the Good of others, and rejoiceth in the Eminency of their Gifts and Graces, in their Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, their Reputation, &amp;c. O that GOD would give, and then increaſe this excellent Spirit in us! Thus the good Things our Neighbour enjoys, will in a Senſe be made our own. Having briefly conſider'd ſome Things in loving our Neighbour; we may further explain this comprehenſive Duty under the next Enquiry, which I now proceed to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What is implied in loving our Neighbour as our ſelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I ſpeak directly to this, I would ſay, <hi>This
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005056_0014_101692C839408650"/>
ſuppoſeth that a regular Self-Love is our Duty.</hi> For this is here brought in as the Rule of our Love to others. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> There is a <hi>vicious Self-love</hi> which is the Root of almoſt all Evil, and Plague of human Society. 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2. <hi>This know alſo, that in the Laſt Days perilous Times ſhall come. For Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt endeavour by all Means to ſubdue this powerful Luſt. We muſt look to JESUS, and lay aſide this Sin which ſo eaſily beſets us; and by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit mortify it: Without this, we ſhall never attend the Duty before us in a right Manner. But then, there is alſo a <hi>regular Self-love,</hi> which muſt be ſought after, and cheriſhed in us; without which we ſhall neither ſeek our own Good, nor the Good of our Neighbour as GOD requireth us. There is a Love and Reverence due to our ſelves, as GOD hath made us capable of glorifying and enjoying him for ever; and ſet us at the Head of this lower Creation. We muſt be clothed with Humility. We muſt <hi>think ſoberly</hi> of our ſelves, and not more highly than is meet; but then we may not ſet light by our ſelves, and deſpiſe our precious Souls, as if but little worth. "We muſt, as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſitor well obſerveth, have a due Regard to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our own Natures, and a due Concern for the Welfare of our own Souls and Bodies." In the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this Love we muſt fly from Sin the worſt of Evils, and take heed we do not deſtroy our own Souls by rejecting the only Saviour, our LORD JESUS CHRIST. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36. <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own Soul; all they that hate me, love Death.</hi> We muſt obſerve that Word, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and trembling. For it is GOD which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure.</hi> We muſt <hi>live ſoberly,</hi> keeping our ſenſitive Appetites and Paſſions under a due Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the Rules of GOD's Word; and thus
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005056_0015_101692CAED2FCF60"/>
poſſeſs our Veſſels in Sanctification and Honour. We muſt take heed to our ſelves, and fly from the hainous Sins of Intemperance, Uncleanneſs and the like; leſt we become viler than the Beaſts that periſh. GOD hath given us our Lives, our Endowments of Body and Mind, our Names and Intereſt in the World, our Callings, our Eſtates, &amp;c. to be improved for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and our Own everlaſting Good: And wo to us if we caſt them away by ſacrificing them to our Luſts. <hi>Self-Murther</hi> is one of the moſt abominable Crimes. The Prodigal that laviſheth away his Eſtate by riotous living, Exceſs in Apparel, Gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will find himſelf deeply in Debt to revenging Juſtice, when GOD ſhall demand an Account of his Stewardſhip. We muſt ſtudy and ſeek our own true Intereſt by thinking on and purſuing the Things which are honeſt, and pure, lovely and of good Report. We muſt by a patient Continuance in Well-doing, ſeek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, that we may obtain eternal Life. If we neglect CHRIST, and his great Salvation, and go on to defile and wound our own Souls till the Day of Grace is finiſhed; we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Wages of our Sin, Eternal Death. And while GOD's Wrath is poured out upon us as Fire which can't be quenched, our own <hi>Conſciences</hi> will in their ſtinging Reflections be to us as the <hi>Worm that never dies.</hi> We muſt then have a tender Regard to our ſelves, take heed to our ſelves, and watch over our own Souls in Love. <hi>Charity muſt begin at home, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not end there.</hi> And indeed if we do not love our ſelves aright, we can't love our Neighbour as we ought to do. For we muſt love our Neighbour as our ſelves. However, when it is ſaid as our ſe1ves. we are not to underſtand it of a <hi>ſtrict Equality</hi> in Degree; but of Love <hi>alike for kind.</hi> As this Particle is alſo uſed to denote Likeneſs, not abſolute Equality. Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed theſe Things, I would ſay in Anſwer to the Enquiry.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005056_0016_101692CEB9B11AA0"/>1. Loving our Neighbour as our ſelves may intend <hi>that we muſt love him in Truth and Sincerity, as we do our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Love to our Neighbour muſt be inward and hearty, and not in Shew and Pretence only. Self love is deeply rooted in our Natures, and as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought into them. Agreeably, this Law of Love muſt be written on our Hearts by the Spirit, and our outward Expreſſions of Love muſt proceed from this inward vital Principle of Grace. It is true, the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is ſaid to <hi>abhor himſelf,</hi> Job 42. 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> as he is ſinful, in which Reſpect he is worſe than nothing: But then he ſhews a ſincere Regard, firſt to the Glory of GOD, and then to his own Well-being, by repenting in Duſt and Aſhes. In like manner our Regard to our Brother's beſt Intereſt muſt be ſincere and hearty. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Let Love be without Diſſimulation.</hi> We may not profeſs Love meerly to ſerve our ſelves of our Neighbour: ſuch baſe Flattery is abominable to the true and faithful GOD. We muſt not act herein as Men pleaſers; but approve our Hearts to GOD in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Seeing ye have purified your Souls in obeying the Truth through the Spirit, unto unfeigned Love of the Brethren; ſee that ye love one another with a true Heart ſervently.</hi> Which brings me to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt love our Neighbour with a ſtrong Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we do our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt love our Neighbour from a pure Heart, and <hi>fervently,</hi> as in the Words but now named. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this Love muſt be ſubordinate to the Love of GOD, which ought to be with all the Heart; above our ſelves, and all other Creatures: But then we ſhould not content our ſelves with the loweſt Degree of Love to our Neighbour. We muſt take heed and beware of Lukewarmneſs in this great Matter of GOD's Law,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005056_0017_101692D1C7F798B8"/>
which we are naturally very prone to. We had need take heed to our ſelves leſt that Evil ſhould prevail, of which our Lord hath forewarned us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 12. <hi>The Love of many ſhall wax cold.</hi> This may refer both to the Love of GOD, and our Neighbour; for indeed they increaſe, or decay together. Our Love to our ſelves is ſtrong; here the Danger is of exceeding: In like manner, our Love to our Neighbour ſhould be in us a lively and active Affection, inclining us to ſeek and promote his Good. We may not ſo engroſs this to our ſelves, as that we ſhould have none, or what is very weak for our Neighbour. Do we earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ſeek after Happineſs our ſelves? We ſhould not be indifferent, but like-minded reſpecting our Neighbour's Welfare, and accordingly endeavour to promote it. In a Word, ſuch ſhould be our Love to our Brother, as that it may incline us to deny our ſelves in ſome leſſer Matters, when his greater Good requires it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 33. <hi>Even as I pleaſe all Men in all Things, not ſeeking mine own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi> We ſhould prefer the ſpiritual Welfare of the Church and People of GOD, before our own temporal Lives. 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the Love of GOD, becauſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> down his Life for us: and we ought to lay down our Lives for the Brethren.</hi> How ſtrong is that Expreſſion of the Love of GOD's People to <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> Pſal 137. 5, 6. <hi>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my right Hand forged her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth; if I prefer not Jeruſalem above my chief Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhould love our Neighbour <hi>ſo as to do to him like as we would be ſhould do to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matth. 7. 12. <hi>Therefore all Things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them: for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> We ſhould as it
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005056_0018_101692D3B18FB2C8"/>
were put our ſelves in our Neighbour's ſtead, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how we could reaſonably deſire to be treated by him reſpecting our Lives, Names, Eſtates, &amp;c. and do to him accordingly. We can't deny that we would have others deal juſtly and fairly with us; we muſt then behave in like manner towards them. We can't deny that we would have others be merciful to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Diſtreſſes; let us then ſhew Mercy to them as the Matter ſhall require. We can't deny that we would have others ſhew us the Reſpect which our Age, or the Places and Relations we ſuſtain, demand of them; we muſt then ſhew the like to them. We can't deny that we deſire others ſhould make ſuitable Allowances to us under our Infirmities, and not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to cenſure us: Let us then do the like to them. This is to love our Neighbour as our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>This is the ſecond Commandment, and it is like unto the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is like unto it. — Theſe Words refer to that which went before. JESUS had ſaid, that to love the LORD our GOD — is the firſt and great Commandment: And then adds, And the ſecond is like unto it, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Here then we may conſider, 1. That this is GOD'S Commandment. 2. It is the ſecond Commandment, and like unto the firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is GOD's Commandment.</p>
            <p>The Love of our Neighbour is a great Duty requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Moral Law, and it is enforced under the Goſpel. Agreeably in different Reſpects it is called both an old, and a new Commandment. 1 <hi>Joh,</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>Brethren, I write no new Commandment unto you, but an old Commandment which ye had from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: The old Commandment is the Word which ye have beard from the beginning. Again, a new Commandment
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005056_0019_101692D65DF95AE8"/>
I write unto you, which Thing is true in him and in you.</hi> This Commandment was from he beginning; it was given to GOD'S ancient People, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not avenge, nor bear any Grudge againſt the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thy People, but thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf: I am the LORD.</hi> And it may alſo be called a new Commandment. Joh. 13. 34. <hi>A new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another.</hi> We have a new and fair Edition of this Law under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, delivered from the corrupt Gloſſes of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees:</hi> It is explain'd under the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Teſtament, and enforc'd by a new and divine Example of our great Lord, who loved us, and gave himſelf for us, and hath made this one peculiar Badge and Character of his true Diſciples, that they love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 35. <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one to another.</hi> But it would be to tranſcribe a conſiderable Part of the New-Teſtament to name all the Texts that relate to this Duty. 1 Joh. 3. 23. <hi>And this is his commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son JESUS CHRIST, and love one another, as he gave us Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This is the ſecond Commandment, and ii is like unto the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the ſecond in Order, and alſo in Dignity; as it comprehends the Duties which reſpect our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. GOD muſt be loved in the firſt and chief Place, and for himſelf: Our Neighbour muſt be loved for His ſake, and in Subordination to him who requires this of us. Accordingly the Duties which nextly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect GOD, are to be ſet before thoſe which nextly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect our Neighbour. We muſt prefer the <hi>religious Worſhip</hi> of GOD to the <hi>civil Reſpect</hi> due to Men. However, there are Inſtances in which by GOD's own

Appointment, ſome leſſer Duties of the firſt Table muſt give Place to ſome principal Duties of the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>I deſired Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</hi> And ſuch is the condeſcending Goodneſs of God to us, that He will have ſome Acts of religious Worſhip omitted for this or that Time, when our Neighbour's Neceſſity requires our preſent Help; rather than that he ſhould ſuffer. e. g. If our Neighbour's Houſe take Fire on the Lord's Day, God will have us ſhew Mercy to him by affording him our needed Help un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſent Difficulty, rather than to attend his public Worſhip for that Time. Behold the tender Mercy of our great Lord and Lawgiver! Surely his Commands are not grievous. But to return. Tho' there be Inequality, yet the ſecond Command is like unto the firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As it is a divine Command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both alike bear the Stamp of the Divine Authority. If we neglect the Duties of the ſecond Table, we not only injure Men; but we alſo affront and offend the glorious God by breaking His Law. And herein doth the great Evil of Sin conſiſt. Agreeably, when <hi>David</hi> had greatly wronged <hi>Uriah</hi> by his Adultery and Murder, he makes that Conſeſſion before God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 4. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this Evil in thy Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Command is very comprehenſive like the firſt.</hi> It contains the Sum and Subſtance of the ſix Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments which reſpect our Duty towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 9. <hi>Owe no Man any thing, but to love one another: For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law. For this, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe Witneſs, Thou ſhalt not covet; and if there be any other Commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:005056_0021_101692DD14AF3638"/>
               <hi>ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Command is in a Senſe founded on the firſt; ſo that neither can be kept in a due Manner, if either be neglected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſuch a cloſe Connection between them, that if one be violated, the other can't be duly obſerved. He that doth not obey the firſt Command, by loving God in Sincerity; will not keep the ſecond, by loving his Neighbour. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 21. <hi>And this Commandment have we from him, that he who loveth GOD, love his Brother alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Love of our Neighbour ſhall never fail; but be for ever perfected in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love to our Neighbour will never fail, no more than Love to God. Indeed every Grace ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Heaven. But then, when Faith and Hope which are ſo eminently uſeful in this State of Trial, ſhall ceaſe as to ſome principal Exerciſe and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the People of God being brought to the open Viſion, and full Enjoyment of Him for ever: I ſay when it is thus, then Love to our Neighbour, like our Love to God, ſhall be perfected for ever as to its higheſt Exerciſe and fulleſt Operation.</p>
            <p>In a Word, In both theſe Commands Love is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and that in Perfection; ſo as to comprehend the whole of Duty which we owe firſt to God, and then to our Neighbour according to His Will. Indeed our Love to God muſt vaſtly exceed, as the Object is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely great and good; but then our Love to our Neighbour here required is commenſurate to all the Duty we owe him. And when this Grace is perfected in Heaven, there will not be the leaſt Complaint of any Defect in relative Duties. All the glorified Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> will be united for ever in perfect Love, without Jar or Diſcord. O

bleſſed Society! Who would not deſire to make one of that moſt happy Communion? And thus we have in ſome imperfect Manner conſidered this comprehenſive Command. I proceed to the</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>Uſe 1. <hi>What hath been ſaid ſhould recommend the Law of GOD to us as moſt excellent, and conſtrain us to adore the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the great Lawgiver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD's Wiſdom and Goodneſs appear in contriving and publiſhing to us ſuch a Compendium and Summary of his Law, in which the whole is in ſome Senſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in one Word, <hi>Love.</hi> Love is the fulfilling of the Law. And how gracious is God in making that to be the Sum of his Law which is ſo excellent in it ſelf, and ſo very uſeful unto us? The Law of God is the Law of Love, and therefore an eaſy Yoke and moſt pleaſant. How delightful is it to love, and be beloved! It is true, this Law of Love is grievous to corrupt Nature; but when Sin the Plague of the Heart is perfectly taken away, and the original Rectitude in which Man was at firſt made, reſtored; then it will be found that our Happineſs conſiſts very much in the Exerciſe of Love. When Love is perfected in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, our Enjoyment will be full. <hi>GOD is Love; and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in GOD, and GOD in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. Let us then delight in the Law of the Lord after the inner Man, and bow our Necks to this eaſy Yoke. The more we live in Love, the more do we live the Life of Heaven upon Earth. And thus have we conſidered the firſt Uſe which relates to both theſe comprehenſive Commands, the Love of God and our Neighbour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence learn how to make a right Judgment whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther we diſcharge our Duty towards our Neighbour, yea or no.</hi>

                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005056_0023_101692E19A380558"/>Doth the outward Performance of our Duty towards our Neighbour flow from an inward Principle of Love? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Though I beſtow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and though I give my Body to be burned, and have not Charity, it proſiteth me nothing.</hi> If we give Alms or the like, to be ſeen of Men, and not from a true Regard to God's Command, and hearty Love to our Neighbour; our good Deeds may make a Noiſe, but then they will vaniſh into Air, and be empty of all ſpiritual Profit reſpecting our own Souls. Whereas the leaſt Service done to our Neighbour from the Exerciſe of true Love, ſhall be graciouſly accepted and rewarded. Even the giving a Cup of cold Water ſhall not loſe its Reward. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>GOD is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, to forget your Work and Labour of Love, which ye have ſhewed toward his Name, in that ye have miniſtred to the Saints, and do miniſter.</hi> Let it be the Labour of Love, and God will remember it according to his rich Grace and Mercy in Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Learn that it muſt be a great Sin to hate our Neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If to love our Neighbour as our ſelves, be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comprehenſive Command, and like to the firſt; then to hate him muſt be a great Sin and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Evil, which virtually Contains in it the Violation of the ſecond Table of the Law. And this the Word of God declareth. 1 Joh. 2. 10, 11. <hi>He that loveth his Brother, abideth in the Light, and there is none Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Stumbling in him. But he that hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is in Darkneſs, and walketh in Darkneſs, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not whither he goeth, becauſe that Darkneſs hath blinded his Eyes.</hi> How ſtrong is the Compariſon! He that loveth his Brother hath that Light in him which will direct him in his Duty towards him; but he that hateth him, is under the Plague of ſpiritual Darkneſs,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005056_0024_101692E44406A3C0"/>
and will wander from the Way of Duty till he is for ever miſerable in the World of outer Darkneſs. And we read, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>He that loveth not his Brother, abideth in Death. Whoſoever hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a Murderer. And ye know that no Murderer hath eternal Life abiding in him.</hi> He is a Murderer in the Temper of his Mind, and therefore is deſtitute of the beginning and firſt Principle of this divine Life. Let us then be ſenſible of the hainous Nature, and great Evil of this Sin; and be excited to fly from it, and cry tO God to ſubdue it in us.</p>

If we love God we ſhall love our Neighbour; for this God requires of us. <hi>This is the Love of GOD, that we keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. And if we truly love our Neighbour, we do alſo love God; for it is in Obedience to his Law, and with an Eye to his Glory. In vain then will Men pretend to be devout and zealous towards God, while they allow themſelves in doing Wrong to their Neighbour in his good Name, Eſtate, or the like.
