            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>DR. Chandler propoſes, at the cloſe of his defence, (p. 266) 'that the debate be reduced within a narrower compaſs, and that nothing that does not immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the merits of the cauſe be offered on either ſide.' Had he made this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, when he undertook to open the plan for an American epiſcopate, ſaying nothing but what directly tended to give it admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind as reaſonable, he would at once have leſſened my labour, and prevented the treſpaſs that has been committed upon the patience of thoſe who have been our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If, in his 'appeal,' in my 'an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer' to it, and in his 'defence' of it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pages are filled with have no more relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to an 'American Epiſcopate,' than the diſpute 'whether Aaron's linnen Ephod was of blue, or a ſea-water-green,' the Doctor very well knows where the blame ought to be laid. No one would have thought it an aſperſion, if he had taken it wholly to himſelf. The limitation he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes though proper at firſt, does not <hi>now</hi> wear ſo equitable an aſpect, at leaſt, as coming from him. He has taken the fulleſt liberty, not
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:011598_0004_0F877A42621AF8E8"/>
only in his 'appeal,' but in his 'vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion' of it; and now he would reſtrain others, keeping them within thoſe bounds he has leaped over, and putting it out of their power to remark upon the greateſt part of what he has been pleaſed to offer. This does not look fair. However, from a juſt ſenſe of that reſpect which is due to the Publick, I ſhall endeavour to make the tryal of their patience as light as may be; ſtill depending ſo far upon their candor, as to ſay what may be neceſſary in juſtice to myſelf, though it ſhould not always imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately relate to the grand point in diſpute.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor further propoſes, "that no invective or abuſe, nothing that ſavors of bigotry or barbarity, be ſuffered to mingle in the debate; but that ingenuous, ſober reaſoning ſhould decide it." He would have made this propoſal with a better grace, if he had more fully exemplified, in his own conduct, what he has here recomended. It is true, his air in writing ſometimes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the appearance of candor and mildneſs; nor is it generally miſbecoming the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or the chriſtian. But will any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that his manner is not too often very like their's who are actuated by a ſpirit of 'bigotry?' Has he no where treated his opponents with 'invective and abuſe?' Are there no inſtances, in which he has had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to evaſive art, rather than ſolid argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Has he never ſubſtituted popular exclamation in the room of good reaſoning?
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:011598_0004_0F877A42621AF8E8"/>
Do we never find him 'diſingenuouſly' en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make others think he has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered powerfully, when he himſelf knew he had ſaid nothing to the purpoſe? Nay, has he never ſo diſhonoured his own character as only to laugh loud, when ſo preſſed as to be unable to make a juſt or ſober reply? The intelligent reader, I doubt not, has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved inſtances in all theſe kinds; and we ſhall have occaſion, in proper time and place, to hold them up to publick view. After all, the propoſal here made is not objected to, ſo far as I am concerned in it. I eſteem it a chriſtian as well as reaſonable rule of conduct, and ſhall accordingly endeavour to govern myſelf by it in what may follow. Should the Doctor think fit to write again, it will be eminently proper in him not to forget to do himſelf, as he propoſes that others ſhould do in this debate. I would adviſe him to bear it habitually on his mind, that Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians as truly as other denominations of chriſtians, may be ſo ſtrongly biaſſed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of their own ſide, as to be equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of perceiving the force of the moſt powerful argument; and that it may, with as much truth, be ſaid of them, that 'in ſeeing they will not ſee,' and 'in hearing they will not underſtand.'</p>
            <p>I SHALL not think it impertinent to ſubjoin here, that it ought not to be looked upon as any fault of mine, if the reader ſhould be detained from the GRAND POINT in diſpute, longer than he might
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:011598_0005_0F877A42E832B1F8"/>
reaſonably expect. I chuſe particularly to mention this, that the Doctor may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his guard for time to come, and not act ſo unfair a part as to endeavour to faſten that blame, in this reſpect, upon others, which he only, in juſtice, is accountable for; as he has put them upon taking notice of what he has ſaid that is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the MAIN SUBJECT, or to paſs it over as impertinent.</p>
            <p>I now go on to offer what I have to ſay in reply to the Doctor's 'defence;' and in the doing of it, I ſhall follow the order in which he has given us his thoughts.</p>

            <head>Reply to Dr. CHANDLER's Introductory Obſervations.</head>
            <p>HE complains bitterly, in this part of his defence, eſpecially of the MANNER, in which he has been oppoſed. As I am not the named perſon againſt whom theſe complaints are made, and feel within my ſelf a conſciouſneſs of not having given any juſt occaſion for them, it would be impertinent in me to remark upon them. The <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Centinel,</hi> who are particularly pointed out, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e evidenced to the world their ability to vindicate themſelves; and, it is probable, the Doctor will hear from them, if they ſhould think it worth while to take notice of the charges he has exhibited againſt them. I would not be taxed with officiouſly going out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my own line to do that which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per buſineſs of others, and for the doing of which they are much better qualified than I can pretend to be.</p>
            <p>NONE of the Doctor's obſervations have any ſpecial reference to me, until we come to the laſt, which he calls "a moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial one," and to which he "requeſts the attention of every reader." I alſo, in my turn, could make a requeſt. It is only this reaſonable one, that the reader, while he attends to the Doctor's "moſt material obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation," would impartially conſider what may be offered, wherein it relates to me, in anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>AFTER a 'dead ſilence,' for a while, as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011598_0006_0F877A44730A7B88"/>
to any 'diſſatisfaction' relative to the plan that had been propoſed, 'it was at length diſcovered (ſays the Doctor) that a number of perſons had entered into a combination to run down the appeal, and vigorouſly to oppoſe, at any rate, the reſidence of Biſhops in America.' The combination he here ſpeaks of, with as poſitive aſſurance as though he himſelf had been an aſſociate, has not, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me into it, the leaſt foundation in truth; but is wholly a phantom of his own imagination. I never heard of a 'ſettled plan of operation,' in which I was to bear a part, and make what, the Doctor ſays, 'may, in ſome ſenſe, be called a regular attack upon the appeal,' till I had this information of it from him. The honeſt truth is, I undertook to anſwer the appeal, becauſe I could hear of no one at New-York, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, or in any part of New-England, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared diſpoſed to engage in this work. Had I then known what the Doctor ſays was 'at length diſcovered,' I ſhould certainly have ſtood by a ſpectator only. As it had been publiſhed, 'that if no objections were offered againſt the propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed american Epiſcopate, it would be taken for granted all parties were ſatisfied,' I was unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>total ſilence</hi> ſhould be conſtrued an argument of <hi>general ſatisfaction,</hi> when I knew nothing was more contrary to the truth; and it was for this ſpecial reaſon that I entred upon an affair, which I ſaid, in the advertiſement to my anſwer, 'would expoſe me to much ill will.' This has been ſhamefully verified ſince by the ſcurrilous treatment I have met with in ſome of the New-York periodical papers, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by my attempting to comply with an epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal deſire publickly made known; although
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011598_0006_0F877A44730A7B88"/>
the <hi>manner</hi> in which it was done has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by ſome as over-mild and candid.</p>
            <p>IN conſequence of the Doctor's imaginary plan of operation, a furious onſet has been made on the harmleſs well-meant appeal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> in 'regular form,' and ſupported by the <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Centinel</hi> in 'week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſkirmiſhes,' in which they were aſſiſted by 'occaſional ſallies of a number of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,' and the whole performed with 'as much ſpirit and warmth as the friends of theſe adventurers could wiſh.' And what was the ſucceſs? Shockingly bad on the ſide of its opponents! For, ſays the Doctor, 'notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their reſolution, alertneſs, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they have been obliged to give up the grand object of the conteſt as above explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.' And here he particularly brings me in as giving up this grand point in diſpute. Says he, 'Dr. Chauncy declares for himſelf and his brethren (p. 180) in the following words; <hi>We deſire no other liberty, than to be left unreſtrained in the exerciſe of our religious principles, in ſo far as we are good members of ſociety. And we are perfectly willing Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians ſhould enjoy this liberty to the full. If they think Biſhops, in their appropriated ſenſe, were conſtituted by</hi> CHRIST, <hi>or his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, we object not a word againſt their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many of them as they pleaſe, if they will be content to have them with</hi> AUTHORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY ALTOGETHER DERIVED FROM CHRIST.' So again, in p. 189, '<hi>It is not</hi> SIMPLY <hi>the exerciſe of any of their religious principles that would give the leaſt uneaſineſs, nor yet the exerciſe of them under as many</hi> PURELY SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITUAL <hi>Biſhops as they would wiſh to have;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011598_0007_0F877A45381FA148"/>
but their having Biſhops under a</hi> STATE E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STABLISHMENT.' Theſe, it is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are my words; but with what truth, or juſtice, the Doctor could ſay, they contain that in them which looks like my 'giving up the main point' in debate, is beſt known to himſelf. He muſt have been ſtrangely inattentive, if he did not perceive, that the Biſhops in his plan, and thoſe I ſpake of, were ESSENTIALLY different, and conſequently that I might oppoſe the former, while I had no objection againſt the latter. What he has here introduced with no ſmall parade, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily affirmed for truth, amounts to no more than a declaration of the ſenſe he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to put upon my words; which ſenſe it may be worthy of notice. I had purpoſely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care to guard againſt, in as explicit a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I well could. The Biſhops I had 'not a word to object to,' the Biſhops that 'would give no uneaſineſs,' were particularly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as having 'AUTHORITY ALTOGETHER FROM CHRIST,' and as being 'PURELY SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITUAL' Biſhops. Theſe, the Doctor could not but know, were, in my apprehenſion, quite different from the Biſhops propoſed in his plan, and that I had largely endeavoured to ſhow wherein they were ſo. And yet, at the very entrance upon his defence, and before he had ſo much as attempted to offer a word in proof that his Biſhops, and thoſe I expreſſed my approbation of, were the SAME, he would prepoſſeſs his readers with the thought, that this was the real truth; and conſequently that I had wrote many ſcores of pages in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that, againſt which 'I had not a word to object.' Is this 'ingenious?' Would not
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011598_0007_0F877A45381FA148"/>
the Doctor have done himſelf more honour, and his cauſe more ſervice, if, in a way of 'ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber reaſoning,' he had endeavoured to make it evident, that I had acted a weak, ridiculous, and inconſiſtent part, before he virtually told the world that I had ſo done. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this boaſted aſſurance, enough was ſaid in the anſwer to the appeal to ſatisfy any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man, that the Biſhops propoſed by Dr. Chandler, and thoſe 'not objected to' by Dr. Chauncy, were as widely different, as this world is from another; and it may hereafter appear, that the aſſigned reaſons for this difference have not been in the leaſt invalidated by any thing the Doctor has offered in his long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured defence. He has indeed very ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily paſſed over this MOST ESSENTIAL part of the diſpute; though more than once called upon to make out the right of Epiſcopalians to ſuch Biſhops as are ſpecified in his publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plan. If he would do juſtice to his own character, and promote the cauſe he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, he muſt not ſubſtitute arbitrary miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruction in the room of ſolid reaſoning, and upon this footing triumphantly aſſure his readers, 'the matter being brought to this iſſue, he might give up all further controverſy.'</p>
            <p>THE Doctor, having ſaid (p. 11) that 'his chief buſineſs was with me,' goes on to 'con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt his own diffidence with my gigantic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.' What gave the occaſion for this? The reader may wonder when I tell him its riſe. The Doctor introduced his appeal by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Publick, 'that he was appointed to this ſervice by the convention of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of New-York, and the Jerſies, with ſome of their brethren from the neighbouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces:'
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011598_0008_0F877A460DC39328"/>
Whereas, I introduced my anſwer to the appeal by ſaying 'that I could not pretend to ſuch diſtinguiſhing honour, but was prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to engage in the cauſe by the deſire of private friends only.' The Doctor ſhrewdly infers herefrom, that he is a man of 'diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,' but that I am a 'giant for confidence;' for no reaſon but becauſe I preſumed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the liſt with one ſo eminently important, as to be ſelected by a venerable body of the Clergy to write an 'appeal to the Publick.' Some of his readers may poſſibly eſteem this incenſe offered to himſelf an illuſtration of his ſingularly modeſt 'diffidence;' but, I am ſure, none of them can account his treatment of me a juſt ſpecimen of that 'ingenious reaſoning' ſtript of all 'abuſe,' which he recommends to others in the management of the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. It would be eaſy, becauſe it would be natural, by comparing the manner of the Doctor's 'coming forward' with mine, to make repriſals, by inverting the order of the contraſt he has brought to view; but the occaſion is too trifling, and I an't diſpoſed to deal in that which may look like returning 'railing for railing.'</p>
            <p>I HAD complained, 'that the arguments in ſupport of the PETITIONS for an American Epiſcopate had been kept ſecret,' and that 'an authentick knowledge of them, though appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, was rejected." To this the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies (p. 12) 'I know nothing of ſuch appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or rejection.' I am diſpoſed to think, he here wrote as he thought. But, if he had taken time for recollection, it is probable he would have called to mind what he might not then have had in actual remembrance. Did he never hear of a formal application made
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011598_0008_0F877A460DC39328"/>
by Dr. Stiles in a letter to the Clerk of the New-York convention, deſiring a copy of their petitions, eſpecially their petition to the King, and of the formal negative put upon this reaſonable requeſt? Did he never hear of any controverſy between the American Whig, and this Clerk of the convention, relative to the petition to the King, wherein he was called upon to put an end to the diſpute by producing the words of the petition, which he refuſed to do? The Doctor muſt be a much greater 'ſtranger in Iſrael' than I took him to be, if he never heard of theſe things. Beſides, I could, were it proper, name one member at leaſt of this convention who was applied to for a copy of the petition to the King, but in vain. Should the Doctor be ignorant of theſe truths, ſurely his ignorance is no proof that they are not ſuch. There might have been the 'applications' and 'rejections' com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, though he knew nothing of them. But, ſays he, 'the complaint is altogether groundleſs; for the plan upon which it was propoſed that Biſhops ſhould be ſent to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and the <hi>arguments</hi> afterwards <hi>made uſe of in ſupport of our petitions,</hi> actually were publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable time before the petitions were ſent.—And afterwards it was voted by our convention, that more particular informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be publiſhed, and the whole matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, for the ſatisfaction of all parties; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which the appeal was drawn up, and publiſhed.' What is all this to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? It is true, ſuch arguments, in ſupport of the plan for American Biſhops, as were thought fit to be publickly uſed, we have been made acquainted with. But the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011598_0009_0F877A469B848A58"/>
is, are theſe the ONLY ones that enforced the petitions that were ſent Home? Will the Doctor venture to ſay, NO OTHERS w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Doctor would have acted a more fair and honourable part, if he had plainly ſaid ſo, and not endeavoured to turn his readers off with diſguiſed amuſement.</p>

            <head>Reply to Dr. CHANDLER's Firſt Section.</head>
            <p>THIS ſection he deſigned as a defence, in part at leaſt, of the 'ſketch of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments' he had brought to view, in his 'ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,' in favour of Epiſcopacy in general. It is a pity he put himſelf to the trouble of giving us this ſketch. I remonſtrated againſt it, in my anſwer, p. 14, and for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The plea, in what he had undertaken, would, by his own confeſſion, 'be equally valid, whether theſe principles were founded right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or wrongly;' and no valuable end could be anſwered by this trouble, unleſs to increaſe the number of his pages, which would DETAIN his readers from attending to the MAIN POINT he propoſed for debate; and needleſsly too, as he gave us only a repetition of arguments that had been before repeated over and over again ſo as to be even nauſeous. He has ſeen fit frankly to acknowledge, defen. p. 77, 'that he was convinced what was ſaid upon the general ſubject, however juſt in itſelf, or proper in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, had been better omitted.' And yet, he has wrote no leſs than ninety-eight pages (more a great deal than one third part of the whole of what he has offered) in ſupport of that, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he was 'convinced' it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if he had ſaid nothing. And what is aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011598_0010_0F877A478FF0D368"/>
not being ſatisfied with barely inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, he has peremptorily declared, p. 77, that his 'adverſaries have eagerly laid hold of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which has been already debated for almoſt 200 years, and will probably be debated for 200 years to come; by this means keeping the PRIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIPAL OBJECT of this controverſy, which is an AMERICAN EPISCOPATE, at a diſtance, and as much as poſſible out of ſight.' Who could have imagined, that one who profeſſes a regard to his own honour and character, could be capable of reflecting blame upon others, not only in an inſtance wherein he himſelf has been groſsly faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but wherein the faultineſs of others, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are at all faulty, is wholly owing to him as its real and only occaſional cauſe? Was not the Doctor the very perſon, who, by his needleſs 'ſketch of arguments' to ſupport Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy in general, 'kept out of ſight the grand object in purſuit?' And did he not hereby render it neceſſary for thoſe who anſwered him to do the like, at leaſt for a while, and until they might, with allowance from him, bring this object into view? He is ſtill inexcuſably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive upon this head; for, ſays he, p. 77, 'the Doctor ſeems to have acted upon this plan, exerting himſelf upon the ſubject of Epiſcopacy as if it was his chief buſineſs in anſwering the appeal; whereas the curioſity of the Public cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to purſue another object.'—I had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed but about 50 pages in 200 upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſubject of Epiſcopacy; and this, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remonſtrated againſt the Doctor's obliging me to take this needleſs trouble, and excuſing myſelf, on this account, to the Public, for poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning, for a while, the conſideration of the grand point in view: And yet, he unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011598_0010_0F877A478FF0D368"/>
brings me in making that my CHIEF BUSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS, which was only a ſmall part of it, and would not indeed have been any part, if he had not unſeaſonably and needleſsly called me to it. The 'other object', which, ſays the Doctor, in the next words, 'the curioſity of the Publick called him to purſue, is an object from which I propoſe to be no longer diverted by an endleſs diſpute concerning Epiſcopacy.' And yet, if the reader can give credit to it, he has ſtill gone on, in contradiction to his own purpoſe, for more than 20 pages; though he had before wrote upon the ſame ſubject more than 70. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, when he calmly reflects upon his injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unfairneſs, not to ſay inconſiſtency with himſelf, as above opened to him, he may be put to the bluſh. It is impoſſible he ſhould think, he has ſhewn himſelf ſo 'ingenuous' as might reaſonably have been expected: Nor will it, after this, appear any thing ſtrange, if we ſhould meet with ſtill more groſs miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor introduced the firſt ſection in his 'appeal' with obſerving, 'that the church of England is epiſcopal, and conſequently holds the neceſſity of Biſhops to govern the church, and to confer eccleſiaſtical orders.' It was ſaid in anſwer, 'that the church of England neither holds, nor is obliged to hold, the DIVINE RIGHT of Biſhops in the appropriated ſenſe, to govern the church, or confer holy orders; and that none of her public offices, or any part of the ſyſtem of her conduct, are founded on this principle.' The Doctor replies, def. p. 16, 'If it be by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue only of the <hi>jus humanum</hi> of Epiſcopacy that Biſhops are neceſſary, ſtill the ends for which they are neceſſary cannot be obtained without
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011598_0011_0F877A484EFB4808"/>
them ſo long as we are ſubject to the authority that requires them.' It is at once eaſy and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſay here, as the authority requiring is by ſuppoſition <hi>meerly human,</hi> no complaints can reaſonably be made by thoſe who could have none to make, if they acknowledged and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured no one but JESUS CHRIST as SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREME HEAD of the chriſtian church.</p>
            <p>BUT the JUS DIVINUM of Epiſcopacy is what the Doctor has all along pleaded for, and it is THIS RIGHT only I ever pretended was not the doctrine of the church of England. And, upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination, in conſequence of what the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has offered, I am abundantly confirmed in the perſuaſion, that this doctrine was never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be delivered as her faith, in any of her public offices; no, not in her 'preface to the book of ordination,' which has the ſtrongeſt aſpect this way. The Doctor thinks the DIVINE RIGHT of Epiſcopacy is clearly and fully aſſerted in this preface. Having cited thoſe words of it he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes make for his purpoſe, which I ſhall throw into the margin, <note n="*" place="bottom">'It is evident to all men diligently reading holy ſcripture, and ancient authors, that, from the apoſtles time, there have been theſe orders of miniſters in CHRIST's church; Biſhops, Prieſts, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. Which offices were evermore had in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend eſtimation, that no man might preſume to execute any of them, except he were firſt called, tried, examined, and known to have ſuch qualities as are requiſite for the ſame; and alſo by public prayer, with impoſition of hands were approved and admitted thereunto by lawful authority. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the intent that theſe orders may be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and reverently uſed and eſteemed in the church of England, no man ſhall be accounted or taken to be a lawful Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon, in the church of England, or ſuffered to execute any of the ſaid functions, except he be called, tried, examined, and admitted thereunto, according to the form hereafter following, or hath had formerly epiſcopal conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ordination.'</note> he obſerves upon them
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011598_0011_0F877A484EFB4808"/>
as follows, 'If the reader will now carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this paſſage, let him ſay, Whether it is eaſy to conceive a more direct, poſitive, and compleat teſtimony in favour of Epiſcopacy, than is here given by the compilers of the <hi>ordinal.</hi> The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the three orders of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, is in this preface fully aſſerted;— the antiquity of this diſtinction is deduced 'from the Apoſtles time;'—the evidence in favour of it is ſaid to be contained 'in holy ſcripture, and ancient authors;'—and the clearneſs of this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is ſuch that it muſt appear 'to all men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently reading the holy ſcripture.' In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this doctrine, 'no man is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lawful <note n="*" place="bottom">I would give notice here, that, after long ſeeking, I was at length helped to a ſight of the OLD ordinal, from the library of the long deceaſed venerable Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather.</hi> Whether it was one of the firſt printed copies, or a reprint from one of theſe, I cannot ſay; becauſe the year in which it was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is not mentioned. But, by its being printed in the Old Engliſh letter, it muſt be of ancient date. At the bottom of the title page are theſe words 'LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON, printed by <hi>Robert Barker</hi> and <hi>John Bill,</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the King's moſt excellent Majeſty. Upon comparing THIS with the PRESENT ordinal I find, that in conformity to the commiſſion granted by King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d to ſeveral Biſhops and other Divines, to review the book of common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the book of the form and manner of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and conſecrating of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, and to prepare ſuch alterations and additions as they thought ſit to offer, that they did accordingly make and prepare a number of alterations and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſome very momentous ones; which were approved by his Majeſty, and eſtabliſhed by act of Parliament in the 14th year of his reign. THIS is the ordinal that has been in uſe ever ſince. I ſhall have occaſion to point out moſt of theſe alterations, in marginal notes, upon what may follow. One very material alteration I ſhall take notice of here. In the OLD ordinal the words, in the preface, are, 'which offices were evermore had in ſuch reverent eſtimation, that no man <hi>by his own private authority</hi> might preſume to execute any of them [the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned offices] except he were firſt called—and alſo by public prayer and impoſition of hands, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and admitted thereunto. And therefore, to the intent that theſe orders ſhould be continued, and reverently uſed and eſteemed in this church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it is requiſite that no man (not being at this preſent, Biſhop, Prieſt, nor Deacon) ſhall execute any of them except he be called, tried, examined, and admitted, according to the form hereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.' In the NEW, they are thus altered, 'which offices were evermore had in ſuch reverend eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>no man might preſume to execute any of them,</hi> except he were firſt called—and alſo by public pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and impoſition of hands were approved and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto <hi>by lawful authority.</hi> And therefore, to the intent—<hi>no man ſhall be accounted, or taken to be, a lawful Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon, in the church of England, or ſuffered to execute any of the ſaid functions,</hi> except he be called, tried, examined, and admitted thereunto according to the form hereafter following, <hi>or hath had formerly epiſcopal conſecration or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>' It is obvious, at firſt ſight, according to the PRESENT ordinal, that no man may be looked upon as a LAWFUL miniſter of the church of England, who has not had epiſcopal ordination; but it it does not appear, that this was the caſe while the OLD or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was in uſe. Certain it is, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned reviewers, King and Parliament, did not think this an indiſputable point: otherwiſe they would not have made an alteration, the principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of which was to put this matter beyond all doubt. It is in fact true, that, under the OLD ordinal, thoſe were admitted to officiate as miniſters in the church of England, who were not epiſcopally ordained: whereas, I ſuppoſe, an inſtance of this kind cannot be produced ſince the 14th of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond.</note> Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon in the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011598_0012_0F877A495D6BBD00"/>
church of England.'—If I ſhould, in my own words, point out the inconcluſiveneſs of the Doctors reaſoning here, he and his friends might
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011598_0012_0F877A495D6BBD00"/>
be diſpoſed to cry out prejudice! obſtinacy! perverſe blindneſs! I ſhall therefore give the proper reply, at leaſt in part, in the language of two famous epiſcopal writers. Biſhop <hi>Hoad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> who has defended Epiſcopacy in a more maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly way than any one I have ever yet met with, in anſwer to Dr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> thus expreſſes himſelf upon this very paſſage in the preface to the book of ordination. <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. his reaſonableneſs of conformity, p. 57, 58.</note> 'You wholly alter the form of that ſentence in the preface to the ordination-office, on which you ground this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and ſeem to me to miſrepreſent the plain deſign and intent of it. For there is ſome difference, I think, between theſe two ſentences, 'Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, are three diſtinct orders in the church, by DIVINE APPOINT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT;' and 'from the Apoſtles times, there have been theſe orders in CHRISt's church, Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons.' The former of theſe is your's; and leads people to think, that the principal intent of this ſentence you ſcruple, was to lay it down for an undoubted truth, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, are three diſtinct
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011598_0013_0F877A49D4CEE780"/>
orders, (in the moſt ſtrict ſenſe of that word, and in oppoſition to thoſe epiſcopal men, who did not approve of that word taken in ſo ſtrict a ſenſe) and that by DIVINE APPOINTMENT. The latter is the ſentence, as it is expreſſed by the church itſelf; and the deſign of it is plainly no more, but to ſignify, that Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, have been in the church from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, diſtinguiſhed from one another by their peculiar offices. But, if you take a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in repreſenting, and underſtanding, every thing in the way which carries moſt difficulty along with it, we cannot help it.' Another champion in the cauſe of the church of England, ſpeaking in reply to this ſame difficulty objected by Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi> againſt miniſterial conformity, obſerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Ollyffe</hi> againſt <hi>Calamy.</hi>
               </note> with reference to the words on which this difficulty is grounded, that they 'ſay nothing of DIVINE RIGHT or APPOINTMENT; but only that, from the Apoſtles times, there have been theſe orders:— from which, the moſt that can be inferred is, that in ſuch churches where there has been need of them, or occaſion for them all, there have been three ſuch ranks of miniſters for the government and inſtruction of CHRIST's church, from the times of the Apoſtles; which yet, by Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s leave, does not prove a DIVINE APPOINTMENT of all,—there having been other things, in the Apoſtles days, which yet for all that are not allowed to be of divine appointment.' <note n="§" place="bottom">It may not improperly be further ſaid, the upper houſe of convocation, no longer than 1702, appear to have been of opinion, that Epiſcopacy, upon the footing of DIVINE APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION, was not the doctrine of the church of England, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that is ſaid in the preface to the ordinal. For, it is obſervable, the lower houſe, this year, in an addreſs to their Lordſhips begged that the declaration they had made, and ſigned, might be entered on their books, the purport of which was, 'that whereas they had been ſcandalouſly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as favourers of Preſbytery, in oppoſition to Epiſcopacy, they now declared, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the ORDER of Biſhops, as SUPERIOR to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, to be of DIVINE APOSTOLICAL INSITUTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON.'—The ſame day they preſented an additional addreſs, ſignifying that whereas this their declaration had given NEW OFFENCE, and that from having been traduced for allowing TOO LITTLE to Epiſcopacy, they were accuſed of ASCRIBING TOO MUCH to it, they begged therefore that their Lordſhips would take the doctrine aforeſaid into their mature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.—<hi>Calamy</hi>'s abridgement, p. 637, 638. It is poſſible, the upper houſe of convocation might be as well acquainted with the preface to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and its true meaning, as Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi>; and yet, they accuſe the lower houſe of aſcribing TOO MUCH to Epiſcopacy, in ſpeaking of the ORDER of Biſhops as SUPERIOR to Preſbyters by DIVINE APOSTOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAL INSTITUTION.</note>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:011598_0013_0F877A49D4CEE780"/>THE Doctor may perceive, by theſe quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from two famous writers in behalf of the church of England, that thoſe who cannot, in the preſent caſe, be taxed with 'prejudices that might influence them to miſrepreſentation,' could diſcern nothing in this 'ordination-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face' that 'ſeemed to have an aſpect' in favour of the DIVINE RIGHT of Epiſcopacy. It is true, it accounts no one a LAWFUL Biſhop, or Prieſt, or Deacon, of the church of England, unleſs admitted to office by LAWFUL authority, in the manner preſcribed. But there is a wide difference between LAWFUL, and DIVINE autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

Does this preface affirm, with the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that the power of <hi>government</hi> and <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are by GOD appropriated to Biſhops, and ſo appopriated to them as that they ought to be exerciſed by no other, and, if they are, that they have no validitv? Let him, if he can, give the leaſt ſhadow of proof, that this idea was intended to be conveyed as the ſenſe of the church of England. Until he is able to do this, it will be a vain thing in him to pretend, that this is the doctrine of the Engliſh church, as held forth in this preface. The plain truth is, the 'book of ordination,' the 'preface' to which we have been conſidering, is formed upon the ſuppoſition, that Preſbyters have the power of <hi>ordination</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with Biſhops; nor can it in any other view be made conſiſtent with itſelf. This, becauſe a matter of importance, even in relation to the grand point in debate, and not commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I will a little dilate upon, and ſhall do it by giving the Public a large extract from Mr. <hi>Ferdinand Shaw</hi>'s 'judgment of the church of England, in point of ordination;' wherein it is ſhewn, that 'ſhe allows a divine inherent right in the Preſbyter's office to ordain.' And I the rather chuſe to exhibit this extract, becauſe it is taken from a pamphlet I lately received from the other ſide the Atlantic, and is, perhaps, the only one in America.</p>
            <p>ONLY, before I proceed, I would take leave juſt to inform the Doctor, that I have tryed the experiment he propoſes, and find, that I can 'honeſtly and conſiſtently ſubſcribe' to this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination preface, with the allowance only of 'explanations' more natural, and 'interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions' leſs ſoftening, than ninety-nine in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are obliged to recur to, before they can,

if they pay any regard to conſcience, ſubſcribe to the thirty-nine articles of the Engliſh church, not to ſay any thing of the book of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer, and other forms to which they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to aſſent and conſent.—To go on,</p>
            <p>SAYS the writer above-mentioned, 'It is very obſervable, that, for above an hundred years after the happy reformation in England, the form of committing to Biſhops and Preſbyters their office and work made no diſtinction at all in the <hi>order</hi>; as is evident to all who have peruſed the FORMER book of ordination. In the ordination of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> the <hi>office</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>take thou authority to execute the office of a Deacon.</hi> This was a diſtinct office, and the perſon was ordained to a diſtinct order in the church. But in the ordination of a Biſhop, or a Preſbyter, it does not appear, by the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that was given them, that they were eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſtinct orders. <note n="*" place="bottom">It appears, on the contrary, that they were eſteemed one and the ſame order. It may to this purpoſe be worthy of ſpecial remark here:—In the OLD ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, previous to the ordination of Prieſts, <hi>Acts</hi> xx. from the 19th to the 24th verſe, was appointed to be read, for the epiſtle; which muſt be eſteemed highly impertinent, if they were not, as EPISCOPOI, to RULE [POIMANEIN] as well as feed the church of GOD. For the goſpel, it is ſaid ſhall be read, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. verſe 18, 19, 20; or elſe <hi>John</hi> xx. from the 19th to 24th verſe, both which paſſages of ſcripture contain the higheſt commiſſion of goſpel-officers; and the laſt of them that power of binding and looſing, which none may preſume to exerciſe, who are not intruſted with the government of the church. The reviewers of the OLD ordinal were clearly and fully ſatisfied of this, and have according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the NEW book of orders, taken away theſe texts from the ordering of Prieſts, and inſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted them as the epiſtles and and goſpels to be read previous to the conſecration of Biſhops.</note> For there was no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

made in the words of ordaining them, that it was for the one, or the other office. In both it was ſaid, 'receive thou the HOLY GHOSt;'—but it was not added (as it is in the PRESENT book of orders) 'for the office and work of a Prieſt, or for the office or work of a Biſhop:<note n="†" place="bottom">In the OLD ordinal, when the Biſhops and the Prieſts preſent lay their hands on the perſon to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Prieſt, the Biſhop is directed to ſay, 'Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the HOLY GHOST: whoſe ſins,' &amp;c —In the NEW, the words he muſt uſe are theſe, 'Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the HOLY GHOST <hi>for the office and work of a Prieſt in the church of GOD now committed to thee by the impoſition of our hands.</hi> Whoſe ſins,' &amp;c.— So alſo in ordering a Biſhop, there is the like alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In the OLD book, the Arch-Biſhop and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops preſent ſhall lay their hands on the elected Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, the Arch-Biſhop ſaying, 'Take the HOLY GHOST, and remember that thou ſtir up the gift', &amp;c.—In the NEW, the words are, 'Receive the HOLY GHOST <hi>for the work and office of a Biſhop in the church of GOD now committed unto thee by the impoſition of our hands, in the name of the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, and of the SON, and of the HOLY GHOST. Amen.</hi> And remember, &amp;c.</note> So that it is plain, there was no real intrinſic difference granted by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-commiſſion to thoſe of the firſt or ſecond order. The powers granted to the one, for ought appears, were granted to the other; for as the commiſſion they received made no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the name or function, ſo neither did it in their authority. Whatever ſpiritual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers the one had given them, to the other were given the ſame. Had Biſhops the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination committed to them, ſo had Preſbyters too, who received the ſame commiſſion by the ſame ſolemnity, in words of the ſame impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and therefore muſt be inveſted with the ſame divine powers.'</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:011598_0015_0F877A4B3A835308"/>And that the church of England conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the ſame mind to this day, I doubt not to make appear from the <hi>preſent</hi> book of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>This, it is true, has been greatly altered by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed reviewers, in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond; and, no doubt, with a direct view to exalt Biſhops, and depreſs Preſbyters. Some of theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations have been already pointed out. There are yet many more. It may not be improper to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice them here. In the OLD book, Prieſts were called, in the exhortation, 'Meſſengers, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Stewards, and PASTORS of the Lord;' but in the NEW, the word PASTORS is deſignedly left out, taking from Prieſts the <hi>paſtoral power,</hi> and making them little or nothing more than Biſhop's Curates.— In the OLD the Biſhop aſked the Prieſt, whether he did think in his heart, that he was truly called, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of GOD, and the order of the church of England, to the <hi>miniſtry</hi> of Prieſthood: in the NEW, it is to the ORDER, as well as miniſtry; making prieſthood an order of itſelf diſtinct from deaconſhip and Epiſcopacy.—In the OLD, the two Biſhops who preſent the elected Biſhop to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, ſay, 'Moſt reverend father in GOD, we preſent unto you this godly and well learned man to be conſecrated a Biſhop:' In the NEW it is, to be ORDAINED as well as conſecrated; intimating here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that he was to be commiſſioned to a new, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and higher office in the church. In the OLD, that part of the litany was read, which ſays, 'that it may pleaſe thee to illuminate all Biſhops, PAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORS, and Miniſters of the 'church with true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.—In the NEW, the words are, 'Give grace, we beſeech thee to all Biſhops, THE PASTORS OF THY CHURCH;'—as though none were PASTORS but Biſhops. And whereas, in the OLD book, the prayer for the Biſhop was, 'that it may pleaſe thee to bleſs this our brother, and ſend thy grace upon him, that he may duly execute the office whereunto he is called to the edifying thy church;—In the NEW it is, 'that he may faithfully ſerve thee in this office to the edifying, and WELL GOVERNING, of thy church.'—</p>
                  <p>It is glaringly evident, from theſe alterations, that the reviewers of the OLD ordinal were much higher in their notions of Epiſcopacy than the firſt reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in whoſe days it was compiled and eſtabliſhed. And it is plain likewiſe, that they were in <hi>Laud</hi>'s ſentiments concerning Epiſcopacy, and intended to make theſe the doctrine of the church of England. But they happily failed herein. Whether this was owing to inattention, or to a non-acceptance of the other alterations, they might have made, either by the King, or Parliament, I cannot ſay. Certain it is, notwithſtanding all the alterations that now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and have been eſtabliſhed, that the power of ORDAINING, which is pretended to be the moſt ES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTIAL one belonging to Biſhops, is ſtill left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, or rather ſtands confirmed in the PRESENT ordinal; as may be ſeen abundantly proved in the above extract from Mr. <hi>Shaw.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> to which every Clergyman is obliged to give his 'unfeigned aſſent and conſent.' This therefore cannot be pretended to be only
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011598_0016_0F877A4CBA2E9B88"/>
the particular opinion of ſome private perſons, but muſt be owned to be the eſtabliſhed doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the church, to which all her ſons are by a moſt ſacred vow bound to conform.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rubrick,</hi> immediately after the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-prayer ſays, 'the Biſhop with the PRIESTS preſent ſhall lay their hands ſeverally upon the head of every one that receiveth the order of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011598_0016_0F877A4CBA2E9B88"/>
prieſthood.' As prieſts are not to ordain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Biſhop, ſo neither is the Biſhop to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain without Prieſts. If the former would be eſteemed invalid, ſo, for ought I can ſee, muſt the latter too: I am ſure, it would be expreſsly contrary to the rules of the church, by which ſome Prieſts are required to be always preſent with, and aſſiſting of the Biſhop in all ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as appears by the <hi>Rubrick</hi> abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, compared with other parts of the office, and Can. 31, 34.</p>
            <p>IT cannot, with any colourable pretence, be ſaid, that the joining of Preſbyters with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in this ſolemn act does only ſignify their witneſſing to, or approbating, the thing done. If thus were all, it might as well be done by the laity who were preſent, or the Deacons; and yet, it is certain, they are not permitted to lay on hands in ordination (as the Prieſts are); though they are permitted to be ſpectators, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, or approvers, as well as they. Beſides, it is evident from the ordination-commiſſion, that the office of Prieſt is conveyed by the Biſhop and Preſbyters JOINTLY. 'Receive the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY GHOST for the office and work of a Prieſt in the church of GOD, now committed unto thee by the impoſition of OUR hands.' From whence it is as plain as words can make it, that prieſtly orders in the church of England are to this very day conferred by the BISHOP AND HIS PRESBYTERS TOGETHER; that the office is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their JOINT AUTHORITY; that the Biſhop ought not to ordain without his Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, any more than without prayer, or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands, which are all made eſſentially neceſſary; yea, that he cannot do it without a very material, but abſolutely unwarrantable,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011598_0017_0F877A4D69CD04F0"/>
alteration of the words in the commiſſion, and perverting the deſign of it, changing the word OUR into MY, and ſaying, 'by the impoſition of MY hands, inſtead of OUR hands; by which variation, how ſmall ſoever it may ſeem, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop would lodge the ſole power of ordaining in himſelf, contrary to the letter and intention of the office, which neceſſarily ſuppoſes, that Preſbyters have the ſame intrinſic power with the Biſhop: otherwiſe it would be no other than a ſolemn piece of mockery to deliver the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the name of the Preſbyters EQUALLY with the Biſhop. For how could they convey pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to others which they had not in themſelves? None certainly ſhould lay on hands at all in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſterial authority, but ſuch to whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it belongs to commit the ſame doctrine to others, which themſelves have received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be teachers of, no more than any ſhould conſecrate the elements in the euchariſt, who were never impowered to adminiſter the ſacrament.</p>
            <p>THERE is not the leaſt appearance of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction by the words in the office, that the granting the commiſſion is only from the Biſhop, and that what the Preſbyters do in conjunction with him is only conſenting to what he does. The church, in the <hi>preface</hi> to the book of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſuppoſes impoſition of hands neceſſary to the conveying the office of the prieſthood. She therein requires PRIESTS, by the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> to lay on hands together with the Biſhop: and, upon the performing of that action, the Biſhop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in expreſs words, 'that the office and work of a Prieſt is committed unto thee by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of OUR hands; which can never be meant, in any proper way of ſpeaking, of the Biſhops
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011598_0017_0F877A4D69CD04F0"/>
hands alone, but include his Preſbyters, who were partners in laying hands with him, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſhare alſo in conveying the power which was by granted by that action, by a right inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in their office; though, by the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution of the country, they are reſtrained from exerciſing it ALONE, as the BISHOP HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF ALSO IS. He may indeed ordain a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con without the concurrence of his Preſbyters, and in this caſe the impoſition of his own hands alone is required: whence it is plain, that the church makes a manifeſt diſtinction betwixt what the Biſhop can do ALONE, and what he cannot do WITHOUT his Preſbyters. She allows him to ordain Deacons by his SOLE power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the office is conferred ONLY by the impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own hands: but when he is to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Prieſts, he muſt then have the concurrence of his Preſbyters with him, and the office is ſaid to be conferred by the impoſition of OUR hands, that is, of Biſhop and Preſbyters CONJUNCTLY. That is done by BOTH TOGETHER, which the church allows not to be done by EITHER SEPARATELY.</p>
            <p>THIS may be illuſtrated from the office of 'conſecrating Biſhops,' which is made exactly to correſpond with that of 'ordering Prieſts,' and therefore muſt be allowed to be a parallel caſe. In this office, conformable to the other, (<hi>mutatis mutandis</hi>) the 'Rubrick', juſt after the ordination-prayer, requires the Arch-Biſhop and Biſhops preſent (of whom there muſt be two at leaſt) to lay their hands upon the elected Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, upon which action the Arch-Biſhop im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pronounces the commiſſion, (as the Biſhop does in the ordination of Prieſts) but declares, 'the office is committed by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of OUR hands;' that is, the epiſcopal func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011598_0018_0F877A4E18E67F18"/>
is conveyed by the impoſition of the hands of the Arch-Biſhop and Biſhops together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom he ought not to conſecrate a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. Now, if a Biſhop can no more ordain a Prieſt without the concurrence of his Preſbyters, than an Arch-Biſhop can conſecrate a Biſhop without the concurrence of his Biſhops; if Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters are required to uſe the 'ſame action' to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Biſhop in the ordination of 'Prieſts,' as Biſhops are with the Arch-Biſhop in the conſecration of a 'Biſhop,' <hi>viz.</hi> impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands; and if the commiſſion granted to 'Prieſts' by the Biſhop and his Preſbyters be in the 'ſame words' with the commiſſion granted to Biſhops by the Arch-Biſhop and his Biſhops, <hi>viz.</hi> 'committed unto thee by the impoſition of OUR hands;' it muſt undeniably follow, that Preſbyters have as much an inherent right in their office (in the opinion of the church of England) for ordaining Prieſts, as Biſhops have in their's for conſecrating Biſhops.'</p>
            <p>IT cannot be pretended, that the Arch-Biſhop ALONE conveys the power, and that the Biſhops who join with him in laying on of hands do it meerly as witneſſes to, or approvers of, his act; becauſe the Arch-Biſhop's power over Biſhops is granted to be meerly eccleſiaſtical, I mean owing to human inſtitution, and not to a divine right.</p>
            <p>LET men make what pretenſions and evaſions they will, it is certain, from the 'book of orders,' and the practice of the church of England, that ſhe allows Preſbyters to ordain in conjunction with their Biſhop, which muſt be underſtood, if words and actions have any determined ſenſe, by virtue of a divine right inherent in their office.</p>
            <p>IF this be not her ſenſe, what an abſurdity
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011598_0018_0F877A4E18E67F18"/>
muſt ſhe be guilty of in ordering their concurrence in the ſign, who have no manner of intereſt or right in the miniſterial conveyance of the thing ſignified by it? Juſt as if it ſhould be ſaid, a Deacon hath power to uſe the words of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Baptiſm, and to apply the proper ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but yet hath not power to baptiſe; or that a Preſbyter may conſecrate the euchariſtical elements, according to CHRIST's inſtitution, and diſtribute them to the People, and yet not have power to adminiſter the LORD's ſupper.</p>
            <p>IF impoſition of hands in ordination be a meer cypher, and empty formality, in Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will it not be concluded, that ſo it is in Biſhops too, and that the laying on of the hands of the one and the other is but a needleſs ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and ſignifies no more to the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of miniſterial authority, than if the hands of meer laymen were impoſed? But, if this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal rite be ſuppoſed to convey the miniſterial commiſſion from the Biſhop, why does it not import the ſame thing from Preſbyters, who are enjoined it by the ſame authority as the Biſhop, and in conjunction with him? Will not every one naturally conclude, that ſince the <hi>action is the ſame,</hi> ſince it is done at <hi>the ſame time,</hi> in the <hi>ſame manner,</hi> with the <hi>ſame words,</hi> and declared by the Biſhop himſelf to be for the <hi>ſame end,</hi> that it conveys the <hi>ſame powers?</hi>' Thus Mr. <hi>Shaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole, if there is no inconſiſtency between the eſtabliſhed <hi>ordinal,</hi> and the <hi>preface</hi> to it, the Biſhops ſpoken of, in the <hi>latter</hi> are not Biſhops in the Doctor's ſenſe, that is, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops who are <hi>divinely</hi> veſted with the <hi>excluſive</hi> right to convey holy orders. For, according to the appointed rule, no man can be ordained a Prieſt without the laying on of the hands of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011598_0019_0F877A4EEAC858C8"/>
Preſbyters as well as of the Biſhop. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining power is lodged, not in the Biſhop ONLY, or EXCLUSIVELY, but in the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and Preſbyters CONJUNCTLY. If Preſbyters cannot ordain by themſelves ALONE, neither can the Biſhop. There muſt be, according to the book, the concurrence of BOTH. It is from hence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the reſtraint laid both upon Biſhops and Preſbyters, as to the exerciſe of their ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, is meerly eccleſiaſtical. The church of England certainly allows an <hi>inherent right</hi> in BOTH to ordain, though ſhe allows neither to exerciſe this right but within certain limitations. And though ſhe accounts none LAWFUL Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Preſbyters but ſuch as have been LAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FULLY admitted to office, ſhe is far from NUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIFYING the orders given by either. She no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where declares ordination by Preſbyters to be invalid, though ſhe eſteems it not LAWFUL. And herein ſhe differs from thoſe few of her high flying ſons, who would make their own uncharitable notions her avowed doctrine.</p>
            <p>WHAT has been above offered in proof, that the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy, according to the Doctor's ſenſe of it, is not contained in the 'pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the book of ordination,' will receive fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtration, if we conſider what were the ſentiments of the firſt reformers, thoſe of them in ſpecial who had a hand in compiling the ordinal.</p>
            <p>I HAD ſaid, from Dr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> (anſw. to the appeal, p. 8) 'that in the year 1537, the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Arch-Deacons, and Clergy of England, in their book intitled, 'the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a chriſtian man,' ſubſcribed with all their hands, and dedicated to the King, expreſsly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, that Prieſts and Biſhops, by GOD's LAW, are ONE and the SAME.' To this the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011598_0019_0F877A4EEAC858C8"/>
(def. p. 22) '<hi>Collier</hi> has given an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of the moſt eſſential parts of this book. In this abſtract there is nothing like what the Doctor would prove from it, but ſomething extremely unlike it.' <hi>Collier</hi>'s ſilence is to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe. Meerly an omiſſion of his, which might have been deſigned to ſerve his own ends, ought to be eſteemed as nothing, when oppoſed to direct poſitive evidence given in the caſe by one of an eſtabliſhed reputation for veracity, eſpecially as he has quoted the very words of the book itſelf. And as to the paſſage in this abſtract, which is 'ſo extremely unlike' to what I had brought to view, it can have this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to thoſe only who are diſordered in their ſight. If there is any 'unlikeneſs,' it muſt be in the following words, which the Doctor has diſtinguiſhed by the manner of printing, 'BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOPS <hi>are authoriſed by our Saviour to</hi> CONTINUE THE SUCCESSION, <hi>and</hi> PERPETUATE THE HI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERARCHY.' But it ought to be remembered, it had been ſaid before, 'Biſhops and Prieſts are one and the ſame thing': and, if ſo, its being ſaid afterwards, 'that Biſhops are authoriſed to continue the ſucceſſion,' conveys preciſely the ſame idea as if it had been ſaid, 'Prieſts are authoriſed' to do this. This paſſage cannot be made at all 'unlike' to the other, unleſs the whole Clergy of the church of England in that day are made to contradict themſelves; for which no reaſon can be aſſigned but that of ſerving a preſent turn.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor allows, that the book intitled, 'a neceſſary erudition for any chriſtian man,' which though 'drawn up by only a committee of the King's nomination,' was yet authoriſed by both houſes of Parliament, prefaced by the King

himſelf, and publiſhed in 1543 by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; I ſay, the Doctor allows (p. 23) that, in this book, it is declared, 'that the ſcripture ſpeaks expreſsly of no more than the two orders of Prieſts and Deacons;' conſequently, Biſhops muſt be, in the apprehenſion of theſe reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of the ſame rank and order with Prieſts, their office the ſame, and the ſuperiority of the one above the other by the ordinance of man, and not of GOD. But, ſays the Doctor, from <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> 'the ERUDITION makes <hi>orders</hi> one of the ſeven ſacraments, and defines it a gift of grace for adminiſtration in the church; that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by conſecration and impoſition of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's hands; that in the beginning of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, this character was given by the Apoſtles.' He then adds, 'how to reconcile theſe paſſages may be difficult; and until this be done, they can prove but little on either ſide.' There is nothing to reconcile in theſe paſſages. If, as theſe reformers ſay, 'the ſcripture makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of only the two orders of Prieſts and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,' Biſhops cannot, in their opinion, be a diſtinct order from Prieſts; conſequently, when they further ſay, 'the gift for adminiſtration in the church is conveyed by conſecration and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Biſhop's hand,' by Biſhop they muſt mean an officer of the ſame rank or order with Prieſts, unleſs they are made fooliſhly, as well as needleſsly, to contradict themſelves, when their words are as capable of a conſiſtent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>IT is evident then, beyond all reaſonable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, from the 'inſtitution' and 'erudition;' that, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, 'Biſhops and Prieſts were one and the ſame order' in the opinion of the church of England. But, ſays
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011598_0020_0F877A4F9E65E7F8"/>
the Doctor, (p. 25) 'at this ſtage of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is no wonder that we meet with ſome crude expreſſions relating to Epiſcopacy.' And again, (p. 24) 'among the doctrines that had not been fully canvaſſed, by <hi>Cranmer</hi> and his friends, muſt be reckoned that of eccleſiaſtical government.' But the plain truth is, the ſentiments of the church of England, relative to Biſhops and Prieſts, were much the ſame in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, as they were in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,; in order to evince which I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (anſ. to app. p. 9) to the 'ſelect aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly called by King <hi>Edward</hi> for the reſolution of ſeveral queſtions relative to the ſettlement of religion.' To which the Doctor replies, 'It was at this time [in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth] and not ten years afterwards, in the reign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Sixth, as Dr. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> following his blind guide, <note n="*" place="bottom">The Dr. would not have diſcovered too much reverence for a celebrated Biſhop of the church of England, if he had here uſed a ſofter epithet. This is not the firſt time he has diſhonored himſelf by ſpeaking too ſlightily of one, who was every way his ſuperior. In a marginal note, (p. 17) he adopts the ſentiments of a puny writer, in one of the New-York peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical papers, concerning this truly great man, by calling the account he gives of his <hi>Irenicum</hi> 'a juſt one.' Says he, 'I do not ſcruple to declare, that I look upon the <hi>Irenicum</hi> to have been a haſty, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, partial account of principles and facts.' If he had poſſeſſed a tolerable ſhare of modeſty, he would not have declared his opinion in ſo harſh and crude a manner concerning a work, which has been read, applauded, and ſo often recurred to, by many of the moſt learned men in Europe. It is to little purpoſe to ſay, 'he wrote it at the age of 24;' or to bring him in ſaying, 'there were many things in it, which if he was to write again, he would not ſay.' It is upon the <hi>known truth</hi> of the <hi>facts</hi> he has related, and the ſolid reaſon that ſupports the <hi>principles</hi> he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that we depend; and not upon the name or authority of the man. Until the book is anſwered, which has never yet been done, and I will venture to ſay never will, it will remain with us in full force. For <hi>facts</hi> are ſtubborn, and <hi>reaſon</hi> is the ſame, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are old or young, or however their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with their intereſt may alter.</note> the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> aſſerts, that theſe

queſtions were given out for diſcuſſion; as is plain from Biſhop <hi>Burnet.</hi>' If this is plain from Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> he is the 'blind guide' to the Doctor, and not the <hi>Irenicum</hi> to me. For, it is obſervable, theſe queſtions with the reſolutions of them, are publiſhed by Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> 'ex M. S. S.

In CRANMER's papers ſome ſingular opinions of his about the nature of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical offices will be found'.— Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> has inſerted (in p. 27) from Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> the other words in the above paſſage I have, for this
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011598_0021_0F877A5110484620"/>
reaſon, omitted quoting, in order to weaken the evidence of <hi>Cranmer</hi>: and yet taking no notice of the former part, he places theſe queſtions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out to be diſcuſſed about <hi>ten years</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from their true date, and in direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>; affirming, at the ſame time, that it was 'plain from him,' that he had fixed the time right. He is able to ſay, whether this was done with deſign, or through inattention. I would candidly attribute it to the latter, however ſtrange it may appear, that he ſhould quote one part of a paſſage, and ſuffer another, he lays ſo great ſtreſs upon, to eſcape his obſervation.</p>
            <p>HE acknowledges (p. 26) that <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the tenth queſtion in theſe words, 'Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts were at one time, and were not two things, but one office in the beginning of CHRIST's religion,' are to be found, as I had quoted them, in the manuſcript publiſhed by <hi>Burnet</hi>; but then adds, 'the reader will not forget the <hi>time</hi> of his giving this anſwer, which was about <hi>ten years</hi> before our preſent offices for ordination were compoſed.' To which I would only ſay, this memento to the reader is the effect of his 'blindly' following a true guide. For it appears from what has been ſaid above, that the very author whoſe authority he relies on ſpeaks of this anſwer of <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s as given, not 'about ten years before the ordinal was compil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,' but in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; and as this book of ordination was publiſhed in the third year of this King's reign, it could be but a very little time before its compoſition; which is the more worthy of ſpecial notice, becauſe, as the Doctor himſelf obſerves '<hi>Cranmer</hi> was the principal perſon concerned in that work.'</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:011598_0022_0F877A511C2D2668"/>HE goes on (p. ibid) 'However ſtrange <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s opinion may appear to have been, there is ſtrong proof that he altered it immediately.' This 'ſtrong proof' follows in theſe words, 'For in the ſame copy of queſtions and reſolutions, Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi>'s anſwer to the eleventh queſtion is; 'I ſuppoſe that a Biſhop hath authority of GOD, as his miniſter, by ſcripture to make a Prieſt; but he ought not to admit any man to be a Prieſt, and conſecrate him, or to appoint him to any miniſtry in the church without the Prince's licence and conſent. And that any other man hath authority to make a Prieſt by ſcripture, I have not read, nor any example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.' To the twelfth queſtion <hi>Leighton</hi> anſwers, 'I ſuppoſe that there is a conſecration required, as by impoſition of hands; for ſo we be taught in the enſamples of the Apoſtles.' Now <hi>Durell,</hi> in his Vindiciae, ſays, 'That, having had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of examining the original manuſcript, he found that Cranmer <hi>gave his conſent to theſe two opinions of</hi> Leighton, ſubſcribing to each <hi>Th: Cantuarienſis.</hi>' It is obſervable, the 'ſtrong proof' that <hi>Cranmer</hi> changed his opinion is reſted upon the evidence of <hi>Durell,</hi> which is really no evidence at all, if Mr. <hi>Boyſe</hi> may be believed, who ſpeaks of him <note n="*" place="bottom">Account of the ancient Epiſcopacy, p. 21.</note> as 'an author too notorious for his many falſhoods and miſtakes in this kind to be depended on.' And the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has unwarily given us ſtrong reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that <hi>Boyſe</hi>'s account of <hi>Durell</hi> is a juſt one. For, ſays he (p. 27) 'Why <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> left out this paſſage is plain; it interfered with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his <hi>Irenicum</hi>: but why <hi>Burnet</hi> omitted it is doubtful.' There can be no doubt in the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011598_0022_0F877A511C2D2668"/>
caſe. If this paſſage was not in the original manuſcript the reaſon of his not inſerting it is at once evident. If it was there, he muſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all controverſy be eſteemed a diſhoneſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher of original manuſcripts; which would, in this caſe, be very extraordinary, as it would have been to his purpoſe to have given us theſe words, and he could have no imaginable tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus unfairly to ſuppreſs them. But ſhould it be ſuppoſed true, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſubſcribed his conſent to the opinion of <hi>Leighton,</hi> as ſignified in the above quoted anſwers to the tenth and twelfth queſtions, it would not argue that he had changed his ſentiments as to this, that 'Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts were not two things, but one office in the beginning of CHRIST's religion.' The only words upon which ſuch a change of opinion can be grounded are theſe, 'I ſuppoſe that a Biſhop hath authority of GOD, as his miniſter, by ſcripture to make a Prieſt—and that any other man hath authority to make a Prieſt by ſcripture I have not read.—But for aught any thing that is here ſaid, Biſhops and Prieſts might, in <hi>Leighton</hi>'s opinion, be one and the ſame order of officers in the church of CHRISt; and nothing appears in any of his other anſwers in contradiction hereto. And as to the words, 'That any other man hath authority to make a Prieſt I have not read,' it is evident that 'by any other man is meant, any other man not veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with clerical authority. The general ſtrain of all the anſwers to this eleventh queſtion plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leads to the thought, that it was intended for the ſettlement of this point, whether the power of making Prieſts was appropriated to the Clergy, ſo as that it might not be exerciſed by meer laymen. It was by no means deſigned
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011598_0023_0F877A51D86EF970"/>
to decide the queſtion, Whether ordination was appropriated to Biſhops in oppoſition to, or excluſion of, Preſbyters? This is put beyond diſpute by the anſwer particularly of the Arch-Biſhop of York to that queſtion, which is this, 'That a Biſhop may make a Prieſt may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from ſcripture—And that ANY OTHER THAN BISHOPS OR PRIESTS may make a Prieſt we neither find in ſcripture, or out of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>THE plain truth is, it does not appear from any one of the anſwers, to any of the propoſed queſtions, that there was a difference in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of theſe Biſhops and Divines as to the ONENESS, or SAMENESS, of the ORDER of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Preſbyters; though they might dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their opinion about the DEGREE in the ſame order. The Arch-Biſhop of York's anſwer to the tenth queſtion, 'Whether Biſhops or Prieſts were firſt,' will convey to us a clear and juſt idea of this; as we find in it ſuch words as theſe, 'the name of a Biſhop is not a name of ORDER but a name of office, ſignifying an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer. And although the inferior Shepherds have alſo care to overſee their flock, yet forasmuch as the Biſhop's charge is alſo to overſee the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherds, the name of overſeers is given to the Biſhops, and not to the other; and as he is in DEGREE higher, ſo in their conſecration we find difference even from the primitive church.' I ſhall yet add; to the 13th queſtion, 'Whether (if it fortuned a chriſtian Prince learned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer certain dominions of infidels, having none but temporal learned men with him) if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the law, that he and they ſhould preach and teach the word of GOD there, or no? and alſo make and conſtitute Prieſts, or no?
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011598_0023_0F877A51D86EF970"/>
I ſay to this 13th queſtion, <hi>Leighton</hi>'s anſwer is, 'I ſuppoſe the affirmative thereof to be true; <hi>quamvis poteſtas clavium refidet praecipue in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia.</hi>' And to the fourteenth queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be forefended by the law (if it ſo fortune that all the Biſhops and Prieſts of a region were dead, and that the word of GOD ſhould remain there unpreached, and the ſacrament of baptiſm and others unminiſtred) that the King of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould make Biſhops and Prieſts to ſupply the ſame or no?' His anſwer is, 'I ſuppoſe the affirmative to be true, in caſe that there cannot Biſhops or PRIESTS be had forth of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries conveniently.' Theſe anſwers are eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from what the Doctor would have given to theſe queſtions, and abſolutely incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the divine right of Epiſcopacy in his ſenſe of it. And yet, theſe ſelected Biſhops and Divines were perfectly unanimous in ſaying, that, in the caſe propoſed, 'learned laymen not only may, but ought to preach and teach GOD's word;' and the greater part of them declare it to be their opinion, that the 'PRINCE, (in this ſame caſe) and his TEMPORAL LEARN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED MEN may make and inſtitute miniſters, or Prieſts.' <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:011598_0024_0F877A5587498638"/>THE Doctor has not yet done with <hi>Cranmer.</hi> (Says he, p. 30) 'After the time of his ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi>'s opinions concerning Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, I find him in no fluctuation of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; but many proofs appear of his ſettled and ſteady belief that Biſhops are ſuperior to Preſbyters by apoſtolical inſtitution.' Enough, I truſt, has been already ſaid to ſhow, that no valid proof has been given, that <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Leighton</hi>'s anſwers; or, if he did, that this was ſufficient to faſten on him a change of ſentiments relative to Epiſcopacy: nor am I yet perſuaded to think, that there are any proofs from which it will appear, that it was ever his 'ſettled belief that Biſhops are ſuperior to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters by apoſtolical inſtitution.' It is a pity the Doctor has not quoted the paſſages in <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s writings, upon which he finds that there was 'no fluctuation in his principles on this head.' He ſpeaks of a '<hi>Catechiſm</hi> he compiled, in which, if we may believe Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> he fully owns the divine inſtitution of Biſhops and Prieſts.' Could a ſight of this catechiſm be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it is probable it might be in our power to refute what is here ſaid from Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>: However this may be, thus much is certain, if we would form a right judgment in this matter, it muſt be from what is ſaid in the catechiſm it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not by implicit faith in the opinion of another, who, perhaps, never ſaw it himſelf. The Doctor likewiſe tells us of a 'ſermon in this catechiſm, or large inſtruction of young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>concerning the authority of the keys,</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> x.13, 14, 15, in which ſermon his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Epiſcopacy and church-government are ſo high, that even the high-flying Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed it at large in his preface to <hi>the divine
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011598_0024_0F877A5587498638"/>
right of Epiſcopacy aſſerted.</hi>' This ſermon is, I conclude, the very one repaired to by Mr. <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in order to prove that <hi>Cranmer</hi> retracted his opinion about Biſhops and Prieſts; to whom Mr. <hi>Boyſe</hi> replies <note n="*" place="bottom">Ancient Epiſcopacy, p. 8.</note> 'the paſſage he has cited in this ſermon no way aſſerts Prieſts and Biſhops to be at the beginning two diſtinct orders.' If the Doctor will bring to view this, or any other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, in this ſermon, or in any other writing of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and from thence point out to us the affirmed change in his ſentiments, we will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſubmit; but until then we ſhall beg leave to think, that he ever adhered to the opinion, 'that Prieſts and Biſhops were at one time, and not two things, but one office in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of CHRIST's religion.</p>
            <p>I HAD ſaid, (anſ. to app. p. 12) from Mr. <hi>J. Owen,</hi> and upon his authority, 'that the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the right of Biſhops to govern and ordain, as being officers in the church ſuperior to Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by divine appointment, was firſt promoted in the church of England by Arch-Biſhop <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d.</hi>' The Doctor takes occaſion from hence to play with the word PROMOTED to make his readers merry. He is utterly at a loſs what to make of it. It is a 'myſterious' word; it contains in it 'ſome ſecret meaning, which he does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend;' it 'muſt be unfolded,' or, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what may be the meaning of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable word, 'he muſt take the liberty to believe, that the national eſtabliſhment of this doctrine again and again, and making it a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle of our reformation, was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething to PROMOTE it.' I aſſure the Doctor I would not have uſed this word, which
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011598_0025_0F877A562178B1F0"/>
appeared to me a harmleſs, well meaning one, could I have foreſeen the ſtrange influence it would have on him. It has certainly very much obſtructed his diſcerning faculty: otherwiſe, it would not have appeared to him, that the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Biſhops to Preſbyters, by divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, was a doctrine that had been 'again and again nationally eſtabliſhed;' much leſs that this was a 'fundamental principle of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.' Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> without all doubt, was the FIRST, I will not ſay that PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOTED this doctrine, leſt a word of ſo profound a meaning ſhould puzzle the Doctor; but he was the FIRST, in oppoſition to any 'national eſtabliſhment,' or its being at all a principle, much leſs 'a fundamental one of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,' that openly aſſerted, and pleaded for this doctrine. Perhaps the Doctor, now I have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a plain word, inſtead of a 'myſterious' one, will be convinced of this by what has been offered to his view: if he is not, I am ſatisfied, the impartial Public will.</p>
            <p>HE goes on, 'if the meaning' of this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible word <hi>promoted</hi> 'be, that none before Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> contended for the ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Biſhops over Preſbyters, by divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in their writings, I muſt ſtill deny it; as I am able to produce abundant evidence to the contrary.' The reader will remember, I brought in Arch Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> as the firſt promoter of Epiſcopacy upon the plan of a divine right, from Mr. <hi>J. Owen,</hi> depending on his authority. Of what great importance is it, whether he was the firſt, ſecond, third, or fourth that contended for this doctrine? And yet, the Doctor has taken up eight or nine pages in endeavouring to prove, that a few others wree before <hi>Laud</hi> in pleading
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011598_0025_0F877A562178B1F0"/>
the divine right of Epiſcopacy. But the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is, he is groſsly miſtaken in the idea he has given of the ſentiments of the men he has named. They were, it is true, Epiſcopalians upon the foot of divine right, in a qualified, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated ſenſe; but not in the ſenſe in which <hi>Laud</hi> and the Doctor, plead for this right. It was not the opinion of any one of them, that the right of Biſhops, by divine appointment, to govern and ordain, was ſuch, as that it could not, as the caſe might require, be altered: and they were clear and full in ſignifying their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents to this purpoſe. I have by me a book, intitled, 'A repreſentation of the government of the church of England, according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Biſhops unto the end of Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi>'s reign,' by <hi>Stephen Lob,</hi> as I find his name inſerted, in the title page, by Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi>; in which are extracts, from all the writers Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> has mentioned, and many more, making it evident, beyond denial, that their notion of Epiſcopacy, upon the <hi>jure divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> plan, was ſo qualified as to be conſiſtent with an intire change in the exerciſe of governing and ordaining power: but it muſt ſuffice, that I may not take up too much room, to bring to view a few of theſe extracts, from only two or three of the moſt illuſtrious of theſe writers; and I have ſelected theſe principally for inſtruction to the Doctor, and to let him and the Public know, that he is HIGHER in his church-principles than the HIGHEST it was in his power to name, when HIGH notions of Epiſcopacy firſt began to be broached.</p>
            <p>HE celebrates Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> as an eminent writer in favour of the divine right of Epiſcopacy; but, whether the Arch-Biſhop's

compared with the evidence we have, that <hi>Bancroft</hi> directly expreſſed his acknowledgment of the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of ordination by Preſbyters. Arch-Biſhop <hi>Spotiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> declares this in ſo many words.

Among the extracts to this purpoſe, the two or three following ones only muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the preſent.</p>
            <p>THE firſt is taken from his ſeventh book, in

theſe words, 'Biſhops, albeit they may avouch with conformity of truth, that their authority hath thus deſcended even from, the very Apoſtles themſelves; yet the ABSOLUTE and EVERLAST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING CONTINUANCE of it they cannot ſay any commandment of the LORD enjoins; and therefore muſt acknowledge, that the church hath power by univerſal conſent, upon urgent cauſe, to TAKE IT AWAY, if thereunto ſhe be conſtrained through the PROUD, TYRANNICAL, AND UNREASONABLE DEALINGS OF HER BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOPS. Therefore, leſt Biſhops ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get themſelves, as if none on earth had AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORITY to touch their ſtates, let them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually bear in mind, that it is rather the <hi>force of cuſtom,</hi> whereby the church, having ſo long found it good to continue under the regiment of her virtuous Biſhops, doth ſtill uphold, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and honor them in that reſpect, than that any ſuch <hi>true and heavenly law</hi> can be ſhewed, by the evidence whereof it may of a truth appear, that the <hi>LORD himſelf hath appointed Preſbyters for ever to be under the regiment of Biſhops in what ſort ſo ever they behave themſelves.</hi>'</p>
            <p>IN the ſame book, he ſays, 'There may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very juſt and ſufficient reaſons to all ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made without a Biſhop.

                  </gap>,</hi> that I might be ſatisfied what his ſentiments were upon this head.</p>
            <p>UNTIL the Doctor ſees fit to profeſs his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to fall in with theſe ſentiments, I ſhall think myſelf at liberty to believe, that <hi>Laud</hi> was the FIRST who promoted Epiſcopacy, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the idea, he, and the very ſmall party he is joined with, entertains concerning it.</p>
            <p>AS, upon the point of <hi>Re-ordination,</hi> he 'does not undertake to contradict me, (to uſe his own words, p. 42) but to place it in a proper point of light,' I ſhall only deſire the reader to take notice of one thing he has omitted, which is of far greater importance than any thing he has offered. It is the act of the thirteenth of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabeth,</hi> which runs thus,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Lob</hi>'s repreſent. of the government of the church of England, p. 59, 60.</note> That every perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the degree of a Biſhop, which doth or ſhall pretend to be a Prieſt or miniſter of GOD's holy word and ſacraments, by reaſon of ANY O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER FORM of inſtitution, conſecration, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, than the FORM NOW USED in the reign of our moſt gracious ſovereign Lady—ſhall— declare his aſſent, and ſubſcribe to all the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this act, <hi>Whittingham</hi> and <hi>Travers,</hi> tho' not ordained according to the FORM THEN IN USE, might notwithſtanding be LAWFUL mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the church of England. I mention this to let the Doctor know, that he was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his declaration, (p. 45) 'that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole reign (that is of Queen <hi>Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>) we are conſidering,—it was an eſtabliſhed law—that no man ſhould be accounted or taken to be a lawful Biſhop, Prieſt, or Deacon, in the church of England, or ſuffered to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any of the ſaid functions, WITHOUT EPIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COPAL ORDINATION.' This is ſaid in direct contradiction to the abovementioned act of the thirteenth of <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi> which continued in force till <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond; when, by another act, 'eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, not in holy orders by EPISCOPAL OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINATION,' was diſabled from 'holding any parſonage whatever, as if he had been natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dead.' <hi>Whitingham</hi> and <hi>Travers</hi> were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore LAWFUL miniſters in the church of England, tho' not EPISCOPALLY ordained; and their holding benefices was not 'by permiſſion thro' the neceſſity of the times,' but in perfect agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the then eſtabliſhed law of the nation.</p>
            <p>I SHALL not think it improper to add here, more eſpecially for the uſe of the Doctor, and his friends, that this act of the thirteenth of <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> is a full proof, that it was not her opinion that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011598_0029_0F877A596FBA5A70"/>
was, by divine appointment, appropriated to Biſhops in diſtinction from Preſbyters, ſo as that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by Preſbyters only was invalid. Had this been her ſentiment, ſhe could not in conſiſtency herewith have given her fiat to this act. Now, let it be particularly remembered, the Doctor has told us, (p. 41) he has 'proved, that the doctrines of the Biſhops and Clergy, in the reign of Queen <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi> muſt have been agreable to the Queen, and to the principal perſons about her court.' If ſo, <hi>Whitgift, Bancroft, Bilſon,</hi> and other epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal writers in this reign, were not for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Biſhops, ſo as to nullify ordination by Preſbyters; nor could they diſown any as LAWFUL miniſters of the church of England MEERLY becauſe they had been ordained by Preſbyters only. The divine right of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the Doctor's ſenſe, could not therefore be the doctrine of the church of England in the reign of Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> (as I have before prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was not in the reigns either of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, or <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth); and to ſay that it could, would be to ſay, that two contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory eſtabliſhments were in force at one and the ſame time.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor now proceeds to ſhow, that there is 'authority in the church of England purely eccleſiaſtical;'—But, as in reply (p. 211) to my third objection to the plan of an American Epiſcopate, he only ſays 'it has been anſwered already, [he muſt mean in this part of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or it is no where endeavoured to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered] I ſhall poſtpone what might have been offered here, until I come to juſtify the force of this objection. Only, I ſhall think it proper to inſert, in this place, a few pertinent words from <hi>Burn,</hi> who is an author the Doctor will
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011598_0029_0F877A596FBA5A70"/>
not ſuſpect to have been wanting in his regard to the church of England. Says he, <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſiaſtical law, vol. 2. under the word ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> 'The truth is, that, after the abolition of the papal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there was no branch of ſovereignty with which the Princes of this realm, for above a century after the reformation, were more delighted than that of being the ſupream head of the church: imagining (as it ſeemeth) that all the power which the Pope claimed and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (ſo far as he was able) was, by the ſtatutes abrogating the papal authority, annexed to the imperial crown of this realm.—The Pope arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to himſelf a juriſdiction ſuperior, not only to his own canon law, but to the municipal laws of kingdoms. And theſe Princes of this realm abovementioned ſeem to have conſidered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as POPES IN THEIR OWN DOMINIONS.'—</p>
            <p>THE Doctor, after he had wrote fifty-eight pages, very pertinently introduces his reader, aſking, 'What is all this to the purpoſe of an American Epiſcopate?' And then as pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwers the queſtion by ſaying, 'I know not.' Why then did he commit ſo groſs a treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs upon the patience of the Public? It is true, he ſaid nothing, in his appeal, 'about the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the reformers upon the points of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, and the King's ſupremacy;' but it is as true, that he ſaid that which contradicted their opinion, and made it neceſſary in anſwering his appeal, to ſet this matter in a juſt light. He has therefore really, though undeſignedly, ſneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at himſelf. If his <hi>ſketch of arguments</hi> 'was to <hi>the purpoſe</hi> of an American Epiſcopate,' it was to <hi>the purpoſe</hi> to make anſwer to it; if it was not
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011598_0030_0F877A5A1987CFF8"/>
to this purpoſe, as is certainly the truth, he knows as well as I, that HE ONLY is the object of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule for giving occaſion to that which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, as not being to the purpoſe of the main point to be diſputed.</p>
            <p>HE now comes to defend his darling doctrine of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion in the line of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. And here he has ſunk much below my expectations; not having offered any one thing that will bear being examined, though in a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory way only.</p>
            <p>I HAD allowed, 'that none have authority in the chriſtian church but thoſe who derive it from CHRIST, either <hi>mediately,</hi> or <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>;' ſuggeſting, that this was 'the opinion of the Coloniſts of whatever denomination:' up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Doctor, taking it for granted that authority, if conveyed <hi>mediately,</hi> muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by <hi>perſonal ſucceſſion,</hi> labours hard to prove a ſelf-evident truth, namely, 'that where a thing is to be conveyed from one perſon to another, not immediately, but by a ſucceſſive communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation through a number of intermediate hands, if any one in the ſucceſſion fails of making the conveyance, the thing evidently ſtops, and paſſes not on to the perſon to whom it is intended'. Who ever diſputed this, which is ſo evident, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re propoſal, that it cannot be made more to by any method of reaſoning whatever? It is a pity the Doctor did not think it proper to prove the <hi>only thing</hi> that here needed proof, <hi>viz.</hi> that authority can be conveyed <hi>mediately</hi> from CHRIST, in no way but by perſonal ſucceſſion. Un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>il he is able to prove this, it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſay, 'if the authority firſt given to A is to paſs on ſucceſſively to B, to C, to D, and to E; ſhould the conveyance ſtop, or be interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011598_0030_0F877A5A1987CFF8"/>
at C, ſo that it paſſes not on to D; in that caſe D does not receive it, and therefore cannot convey it to E, unleſs D is able to give what it has not.' This pompous ſhew of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may delude weak minds, but is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a rope of ſand, unleſs it be firſt proved, that the authority is ſo given, that it can in no <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> way be conveyed, but in ſucceſſion from A to B, and ſo on. We join with the Doctor in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'That no number of men on earth, nor all the Angels in Heaven, can give authority from CHRIST not given to them, or renew this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority if loſt.' And what then? Is it not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the moſt vulgar underſtanding, that the grand point in diſpute is here begged, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be granted, namely, that authority is given by CHRIST to be communicated by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſucceſſion, and that there is no other <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> way in which it can be communicated? The Doctor might have known, as he pretends an acquaintance with <hi>Hooker</hi>'s 'immortal work,' that the church, at leaſt in his opinion, is the <hi>true original ſubject</hi> of all power from CHRIST; and that ſhe may <hi>take it away</hi> even from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, if they are <hi>proud, tyrannical, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable in their dealings,</hi> as GOD knows has too often been the caſe. He accordingly declares, <hi>we are not ſimply, and without exception to urge a lineal deſcent of power from the Apoſtles by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſucceſſion of Biſhops in every effectual ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> has clearly expreſſed, and conciſely proved, our ſentiments upon this head. Says he, in his defence of the reformation, part 4, p. 94, 95,— 'Wherein the ſcripture recommends to the faithful, the taking diligent heed to the preſervation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their faith, and to propogate it to their children, it gives them by that very thing a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent right to make uſe of all proper means in order to that end; and every body knows the miniſtry is one of thoſe means, and therefore the obligation the faithful are under to preſerve and propagate the faith, includes that of CREATING to themſelves Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors when they cannot have them otherwiſe: in ſhort, when the ſcripture teaches that the faithful have a right to chuſe their Paſtors, it teaches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that they have a right to inſtal them into their office in caſe of neceſſity; for that call conſiſting more eſſentially in <hi>election</hi> than in <hi>inſtallation,</hi> which is but a formality, there is no reaſon to believe that GOD would have given the people a right to chuſe their Paſtors, and to have them inſtalled by others, and that he has not given them at the ſame time a power of <hi>inſtalling them themſelves,</hi> when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done otherwiſe, ſince naturally that which we have a right to do by another, we have a right to do by ourſelves.' Nay, even <hi>Dodwell</hi> himſelf, that high-flying Epiſcopalian ſeems to have expreſſed near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame ſentiments, [whether it be, or be not, conſiſtent with the other parts of his ſcheme] in his <hi>ſeparation of churches.</hi> Says he, as he is quoted by Mr. <hi>M. H</hi>'s. enquiry into the nature of ſchiſm, (p. 49,)—'Whenever any perſon is inveſted into the ſupream power, and the ſociety over which he is placed is independant on other ſocieties, ſuch a perſon can never be placed in his power if not by them who muſt after be his ſubjects, unleſs by his predeceſſor, which no ſociety can depend upon for a <hi>conſtant rule of ſucceſſion.</hi>—I am apt to think this muſt have been the way of <hi>making Biſhops</hi> at firſt, how abſolute ſoever I conceive them to be when they are once made.—This ſeems beſt to agree with the <hi>abſoluteneſs of particular churches,</hi> before they had by compact united themſelves under metropolitans and exarchs, into provincial and dioceſan churches; and this ſeems to have been fitted for the frequent perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of thoſe earlier ages, when <hi>every church was able to ſecure its own ſucceſſion,</hi> without depending on the uncertain opportunities of meeting the Biſhops of the whole province: and the alteration of this practice, the giving the Biſhops of the province an intereſt in the choice of every particular Colleague, ſeems not to have been ſo much from <hi>want of power</hi> in the particular churches to do it, as for the ſecurity of compacts that they might be certain of ſuch a colleague as would obſerve them.—It is probable that it was in imitation of the <hi>philoſophers ſucceſſions,</hi> that theſe <hi>eccleſiaſtical ſucceſſions</hi> were framed; and when the philoſophers failed to nominate their own ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, the election was in the ſchools.' My author's remark upon theſe words is, 'If every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church had originally a <hi>power within itſelf</hi> to chuſe and inveſt its Biſhops, and the concurrence of other Biſhops herein was not for want of <hi>power</hi> in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church, but only for ſecuring the agreement of Biſhops among themſelves, we have done with the neceſſity of a continued line of epiſcopal ordination, and there may be true miſſion without it.'</note> which ſucceſſion will be as truly veſted with authority from CHRIST, as if it had been uninterruptedly handed down from the Apoſtles. The Doctor, inſtead of attempting to diſprove theſe tenets, takes it for granted, that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from CHRIST can be conveyed in no <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi>

The Doctor rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, 'This aſſertion militates as forcibly againſt the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion which <hi>the churches in the Colonies certainly believe,</hi> as againſt the epiſcopal.' The <hi>colony-churches</hi> are ſo far 'from certainly believing' what the Doctor would here make them believe, that they care nothing about an uninterrupted line, either of Biſhops or Preſbyters; as they know they have power from CHRIST to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute officers for all the purpoſes of the goſpel-miniſtry, ſhould it ſo happen, that the line of ſucceſſion, in regard of Preſbyters, as well as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, had been interrupted and broken.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor goes on, 'as to the ſucceſſion in the line of Biſhops, I am ſtill of opinion, that it is incumbent on the objectors to prove, that it has been interrupted'. One would naturally be diſpoſed to think, it was incumbent on thoſe, who urge the abſolute neceſſity of the non-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of this line, in order to the validity of goſpel-adminiſtrations, to prove that it has not been interrupted; eſpecially if they are the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators. For myſelf, I am free to own, I ſhould not dare to meddle with the diſpenſation of goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-ordinances, upon the doctrine of an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted line, unleſs I was able, fairly to prove, that I was myſelf in this line without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor here mentions ſome things <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively</hi> in favour of the line's being uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Says he, 'We know, by the beſt hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical evidence, that it has been the univerſal
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011598_0032_0F877A5B9DF16F90"/>
practice of the church, from the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to the preſent hour, to acknowledge none for Biſhops who were not ordained by other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.' It is impoſſible he, or his party, ſhould be poſſeſſed of this knowledge, unleſs in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation only; becauſe it can have exiſtence no where elſe, having no reality as a truth, from the practice of any one chriſtian church for the firſt two hundred years. Throughout this long ſpace, no proof can be given, that 'none were acknowledged for Biſhops, who were not ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Biſhops' in the impleaded ſenſe. If there can, let it be produced. It has never yet been done, and I challenge the Doctor to do it: nor indeed was it ever the 'univerſal practice,' in any age, even to this day, to 'acknowledge none for Biſhops, but thoſe who were ordained by Biſhops,' upon the plan of a DIVINE RIGHT. He goes on, 'the conſecration of Biſhops was a public act—eſteemed to be a matter of ſuch importance that the report of it was immediately carried even to diſtant places—and, in diſputed caſes, it was eaſy to diſcover, whether the perſon was, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, a Biſhop or not; or, ſuppoſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that no one would receive epiſcopal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration from ſuch hands.' I ſhall leave it with common ſenſe to judge, whether this is any other than a ſandy bottom to build one's faith upon, in a matter of ſuch eſſential concern as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruption of this line is made to be. And what the Doctor yet adds is as weak an one. Says he, 'We know from ſcripture, that IF ſuch a ſucceſſion is as neceſſary, as, upon a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative examination, it appears to be, CHRIST has promiſed to preſerve and continue it to the end of the world.' That is, in plain engliſh, if it be ſuppoſed, allowed, and taken for granted,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011598_0033_0F877A5C5C2BD290"/>
that CHRIST has made an uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion neceſſary, he will take care, in virtue of his promiſe, to preſerve and continue it. A nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcovery this! Who, beſides the Doctor, that regards his character, would declare in the face of the world, that he was 'abundantly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with theſe various kinds of evidence,' in an affair eſſentially connected, in his view, with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation, which, when examined, appear to be meer nothing?</p>
            <p>I HAD ſaid, that, to make the very being of a church, and all covenant hopes of ſalvation, to reſt upon ſo precarious a foundation as an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſſion in the line of Biſhops, was to expoſe the religion of CHRIST to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule;—That it would follow upon this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that the public worſhip of the non-epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palian Coloniſts, of all the diſſenters in England, and of all the reformed churches who had no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters but ſuch as were ordained by Preſbyters, would be an affront to CHRIST; and that, at the reformation, if the popiſh Biſhops had ſtuck to their old principles, and diſcontinued the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion by refuſing to ordain any but thoſe of their own communion, it would have been the duty of the laity to have lived without goſpel ordinances till a new commiſſion was ſent from Heaven to give authority to adminiſter them;— And I am greatly confirmed in the propriety and force of theſe objections by what the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has ſaid in anſwer to them. Let the reader compare what we have both offered, and judge for himſelf. And, perhaps, he will not judge differently from Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> in the like caſe; whoſe words are theſe. <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT was further obſerved, in anſwer to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, 'That the worſt of this doctrine of an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſſion is, its being derived through the church of Rome;' concerning which it is declared by the church of England in her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, 'that as at preſent it is, and hath been for nine hundred years, it is <hi>ſo far</hi> from being of the nature of the TRUE CHURCH, that NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THING CAN BE MORE;' beſides which, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly ſpeaks of this church as a FOUL, FIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THY, OLD, WITHERED HARLOT, the FOULEST and FILTHIEST that was EVER SEEN.' What now is the Doctor's reply? He gives it in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he quotes from Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s defence, the whole force of which, ſo far as there is any, lies in theſe words, 'Harlot as ſhe is, ſhe may bring forth children, as well as an honeſt and virtuous matron, and ſometimes children far better than their parent.

            <p>THE Doctor ſays nothing further, in this ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in his own defence, that calls for enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by way of reply.</p>
            <p>THOUGH he had needleſsly introduced an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, in his appeal, from <hi>Chillingſworth</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Epiſcopacy, I thought it proper to take ſome notice of it. What he has offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his defence, is, as I apprehend, very little to the purpoſe. I deſire therefore nothing more, than that the reader would examine what we have both ſaid, and then judge between us.</p>
            <p>HE does not deny, that Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> when he wrote his vindication of the church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, 'believed Biſhops and Preſbyters to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees of the ſame office.' But he adds, 'his ſubſequent writings afford innumerable proofs, that he afterwards believed the doctrine of Epiſcopacy, both by the evidence of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the practice of the primitive church.' When he wrote his vindication, he believed the doctrine of Epiſcopacy in the ſenſe that nineteen in twenty of the members of the church of England believed it then, and believe it now; but that
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011598_0035_0F877A5EEAC01B68"/>
he ever believed it in the Doctor's ſenſe, or that he ever wrote any thing from whence this can be made evident, I ſhall not be perſuaded to think, until I have better proof of it than bare affirmation <note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſtrange the Doctor has given us no proof from any of the 'writings' of Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> as they 'afford innumerable proofs,' that he believed the doctrine of Epiſcopacy, in the impleaded ſenſe. It may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, it was not in his power to do this; and the rather, becauſe the Biſhop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſentiments mentioned in the anſwer to the appeal, when Epiſcopacy was in its zenith, and it might be expected, on that account, that he would have ſpoken as highly of it, as his conſcience would permit. And yet, he is particularly expreſs in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Biſhop and Preſbyter, not <hi>diſtinct orders,</hi> but <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees</hi> only in the ſame office. His words are theſe, which I chooſe to quote, that the reader may ſee in how full and ſtrong a manner he delivers his ſentiments upon this head. Says he, Vind. of the the church of Scotland, p 310, 'I do not alledge a Biſhop to be a diſtinct office from a Preſbyter, but a different degree of the ſame office.'— And again, p. 331, 'I acknowledge Biſhop and Preſbyter to be one and the ſame office, and ſo plead for no new office-bearer in the church. The firſt branch of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is their authority to publiſh the goſpel, to manage the worſhip, and diſpenſe the ſacraments; and this is ALL that is of DIVINE RIGHT in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, in which Biſhops and Preſbyters are equally ſharers: But beſides this, the church claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a power of juriſdiction, of making rules for diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and executing the ſame; all which indeed is ſutable to the common laws of ſocieties, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules of ſcripture, but hath no poſitive warrant from any ſcripture precept.— I herefore, as to the management of this juriſdiction, it is in the church's power to caſt it into what mould ſhe will.'—</note>: nor I ſhall believe, that <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ever departed ſo far from the ſentiments of his
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011598_0035_0F877A5EEAC01B68"/>
               <hi>Irenicum,</hi> as to fall in with the Doctor in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>jure divinino-ſhip</hi> of Biſhops in diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Preſbyters, before I ſee it otherwiſe evidenced than by his naked aſſertion.</p>
            <p>I SHALL take this opportunity to aſſure the Doctor, that I am not aſhamed openly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that I pay 'more deference to <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Rector of Sutton, than to <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dean of St. Paul's, or Biſhop of Worceſter, in the diſpute relative to Epiſcopacy.' He may call this 'par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, abſurd, and prepoſterous:' But it may be, the Public will think with me, that a <hi>rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip,</hi> or <hi>biſhopric</hi> might have ſome influence to enlarge his notions of the power and dignity of Biſhops, though never that I know of, to the height the Doctor would carry them.</p>
            <p>AS to Arch-Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> that known and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated antiquary, it is as evident as a fact of this nature can be, that it was his ſettled opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'That Biſhops and Preſbyters differ only in degree, not in order. What the Doctor has ſaid tends only to diſguiſe, not to invalidate this truth. I never ſaid, or thought, that the Arch-Biſhop eſteemed <hi>ordination</hi> by Preſbyters <hi>regular,</hi> where there were Biſhops by whom it might be obtained. But it is indiſputable, even from the very words omitted by me, in the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's letter to <hi>Bernard,</hi> but cited by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that he accounted <hi>ordination by Preſbyters to be valid in places where Biſhops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be had</hi>; which is eſſentially inconſiſtent with the Doctor's ſcheme. The plain truth is, the Arch-Biſhop neither thought Biſhops were a diſtinct order from Preſbyters, or that ordination was, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment, appropriated to that order. This is, beyond all reaſonable diſpute, evident from his own words, profeſſedly uſed in arguing
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011598_0036_0F877A5F58C70C50"/>
upon this point, as produced by Dr. <hi>Parr</hi> who wrote his life. <note n="*" place="bottom">Appendix to his life, p. 6.</note> They run thus.

            <p>THE Doctor finiſhes this firſt ſection by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, 'That he is more eſtabliſhed than ever in the belief that Epiſcopacy is not only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and catholic, but truly apoſtolical.' But this faith of his, and the publication of it, are to no purpoſe. He made his appeal to the 'impartial Public;' and to this tribunal the diſpute, on both ſides, is ſubmitted.

            <p>THE Doctor has ſeen fit, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, to paſs over almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, this ſection relates to, that was mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; chooſing to detain his readers, from the main point, by calling their attention to that which is of comparatively ſmall importance.</p>
            <p>HE thought it proper, in his appeal, to make a diſtinction 'between the ſeveral things that had been added to the epiſcopal office, and thoſe which originally and eſſentially belong to it.' It was ſaid in reply, 'The queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe and ſuch like appendages to the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal office will be deſtructive of the powers which eſſentially belong to it; but whether they do not unfit the perſons veſted with it for the proper diſcharge of the duties of it? inſomuch that it would be unreaſonable to add ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages, and as much ſo to expect, if they are added, that chriſtian profeſſors ſhould not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it as an intolerable grievance.' The Doctor affects, to be at a loſs to know, who I meant by 'chriſtian profeſſors,' by his crying out 'Profeſſors of what!' I will tell him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011598_0037_0F877A6269003358"/>
of faith in CHRIST, as the one only SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREME HEAD of the church, in oppoſition to all other claims, whether they are made by the POPE, or any chriſtian PRINCES or STATES whatever. He then ſays, 'Whether the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch append<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ges be reaſonable, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, is nothing to me; and, which is much more, it is nothing to the caſe of ſuch an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate as is propoſed for America.' Why then, in the name of wonder, did he ſay any thing about theſe appendages? If it was nothing to him, that is, the cauſe he was defending, and nothing to the caſe of an American Epiſcopate, it was moſt certainly to no purpoſe for him to ſay a word about them.</p>
            <p>IN proſecuting the diſtinct on he had made, he obſerved. 'He who has a ſmall dioceſs has the ſame epiſcopal powers, as he that has a large one; and it matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not as to the validity of the act, whether it be performed by the one or the other.' To which it was anſwered, as he has ſummed up the anſwer, 'It certainly does as to his capacity to ſerve the ends of his office; and there is, in proportion, the ſame incongruity in placing Biſhops at the head of large dioceſſes, as in having an univerſal one.' What now ſays the Doctor to this? His reply is, 'This conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an anſwer to me, and in no other light are we authoriſed to conſider it, amounts to no more than this; that although what I ſaid is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be true, yet ſomething that I did not ſay is entirely falſe. The thing which I did not ſay is, that a Biſhop is as able to ſerve the great ends of his office in a large dioceſs as in a ſmall one.' It is true, he did not ſay this; but it is as true, that it was with propriety, and irreſiſtable
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011598_0037_0F877A6269003358"/>
force that I ſaid it. He knows, or is groſsly ignorant, that we never diſowned the validity of epiſcopal acts, where Biſhops had large dioceſſes. He knows alſo, unleſs he is an utter ſtranger to the non-epiſcopalian ſentiments, that we judge it highly improper, and an intolerable grievance, that Biſhops ſhould be at the head of large dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; becauſe it deſtroys their capacity to ſerve the ends, deſigned by CHRIST in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their office. His only buſineſs therefore was to ſhow, that this appendage did not affect the Biſhop's capacity to anſwer the ends of his appointment. As the 'validity' of epiſcopal acts was never called in queſtion, on account of the largeneſs, or ſmallneſs, of their dioceſſes, his mentioning this appendage was quite impertinent, unleſs with a view to prove, in oppoſition to us, that it would conſiſt with the Biſhops duty; which, it ſhould ſeem, he does think was any part of what he was called to. However, he goes on, 'If I had ſaid this [that a Biſhop is as able to ſerve the ends of his office in a large dioceſs, as a ſmall one,] unleſs the large dioceſs is ſuppoſed to be larger than in any proteſtant country—it would not have been ſo very exceptionable."—Much might be ſaid here, but I ſhall make no other anſwer than this, that when the Doctor underſtands the full meaning of thoſe words of our Saviour, 'My kingdom is not of this world,' and has his mind impreſſed with a juſt ſenſe of the duty incumbent on a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in the church of CHRIST, I have no doubt but he will alter his ſentiments upon this head.</p>
            <p>HE now paſſes on to the trite worn-out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>Aerius</hi> and <hi>Colluthus,</hi> but without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing worthy of detaining us very long.</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>Aerius</hi>; I had ſaid, 'That <hi>Epiphanius</hi>

was the firſt that found fault with him, for his opinion of the parity of Biſhops and Preſbyters.' Upon this the Doctor, that he might make ſome ſhew of learning, egregiouſsly trifles. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing that needs a remark is, his obſerving, 'If an intimation is intended, that <hi>Ephiphanius</hi> was the only perſon that, <hi>at firſt,</hi> conſidered the doctrine of <hi>Aerius</hi> as exceptionable, or that the parity of Biſhops and Preſbyters was generally admitted in the fourth century, the ſuggeſtion is groundleſs. The united voice of antiquity, and even the conceſſions of our moſt conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, prove the contrary with invincible evidence.' This is not the firſt or ſecond time, that the Doctor has diſcovered his little acquaintance with antiquity; though he ſpeaks with poſitive aſſurance, as though he was the moſt learned antiquary. Epiſcopal writers of the firſt figure, ſuch as <hi>Reignolds, Jewel, Bridges,</hi> Biſhop of Oxford, <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Regius Profeſſor of divinity in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge, Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi> and others, would have informed him, had he not read the original authors, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, Auſtin, Ambroſe, Sedulius, Primaſius, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtom, The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>phy act,</hi> were, as to the identity of order upon the footing of divine right, of the ſame opinion with <hi>Aerius,</hi> though they lived much about the ſame time; and, I may add, ſo were <hi>Clement</hi> of Rome, <hi>Polycarp, Juſtin,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived before him. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the leaſt probable, that <hi>Aerius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned CHIEFLY, as the Doctor or ſays, for his opinion concerning the parity of Biſhops and Preſbyters. Had this been the caſe, moſt of his co-temporaries muſt have been condemned likewiſe, as they were chargeable with the ſame monſtrous hereſy. It is far more reaſonable to
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011598_0038_0F877A631805F6A0"/>
think, that he acted in oppoſition to the <hi>then</hi> general practice, exciting, in conſequence of his opinion, diviſions and diſcord; and that this, among other things, was the true reaſon of his condemnation. And this indeed appears to be the purport of the account, the Doctor himſelf has given us from <hi>Moſheim,</hi> the only evidence he has brought to prove, that <hi>Aerius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, not 'meerly or only,' as I had ſaid, but CHIEFLY for his opinion concerning the identity of Biſhops and Preſbyters.</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>Collythus</hi>; he has added an 'extract from the ſynodical epiſtle of the Biſhops of <hi>Egypt, Thebais, Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Pontapolis,</hi> and from a joint letter of the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> both preſerved in the works of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>' But if he had ſeen fit, as he was deſired, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult <hi>Blondel</hi>'s Apologia, or what is ſaid from it in the Irenicum, he would have found a full anſwer to theſe extracts. I ſhall here lay before his view what is ſaid in the Irenicum as a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of <hi>Blondel</hi>'s repreſentation. It is in theſe words,<note n="*" place="bottom">Iren. p. 381, 382.</note> 'Firſt, the pronouncing ſuch an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion null doth not evidence, that they looked on or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination as belonging, of divine right, only to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; for we find, by many inſtances, that act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a bare contempt of eccleſiaſtical canons was ſufficient to degrade any from being Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. Secondly, if <hi>Iſchyrds</hi> had been ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Biſhop, there were circumſtances enough to induce the council to pronounce it null.

            <p>I NOW come, my readers, to hold out to your view, not a 'CURIOSITY,' but a marvellous phenomenon in the 'regions of controverſy.' The Doctor had ſaid, in his appeal, 'No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an ordination by meer Preſbyters can be found in the church for ſeveral ages.' It was offered in reply, 'We ſhould take it kindly to have pointed out to us ſo much as ONE in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, within the long period of an hundred and fifty years from CHRIST, of an ordination by any Biſhop, in any part of the chriſtian world; meaning by a Biſhop, an officer in the church ſuperior to a Preſbyter. I have lately been looking over the extracts I made twenty years ago from the FATHERS OF THE TWO FIRST CENTURIES, and do not find a SINGLE EXAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE of an ordination by Biſhops, in the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated ſenſe, within the time before ſpecified. If the Doctor would preſent us with one [that is from the FATHERS within this time] it would be to me a great favour.' What now is the Doctor's anſwer? It follows in theſe words, 'Behold, reader, a curioſity. This very ſame challenge he made in his <hi>Dudlean</hi> lecture, (p. 70) to which a formal and direct anſwer has been given by Mr. <hi>Leaming.</hi> His words are as follow: I will comply with his (Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s) demand; and I hope he will allow the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my author. I might produce many, but for brevity's ſake ſhall mention but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and that is the ordination of <hi>Titus</hi> by
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011598_0039_0F877A63E570CB08"/>
St. <hi>Paul.</hi> That <hi>Titus</hi> had an epiſcopal ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears from the charge St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. 'For this cauſe left I thee in Crete, that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I HAD APPOINTED THEE' St. <hi>Paul</hi> charged him to 'rebuke with all authority;' and again, 'a man that is an heretic, after the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond admonition, reject.' Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts to <hi>Titus</hi> the whole power of ordaining el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Crete, and of governing them, and all the chriſtians in that Iſland. This authority is clearly expreſſed, and the bounds, in which he was to exerciſe it, diſtinctly marked out. Thus it appears, that this was an <hi>epiſcopal ordination</hi> in our ſenſe of the matter. Our Biſhops claim nothing but the very ſame power that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Titus</hi> over the Iſland of Crete.' Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cited this paſſage from Mr. <hi>Leaming,</hi> he goes on, 'Is not this a fair and full anſwer to the Doctor's demand? Ought he then to be unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, when all that he aſks has been given him?' Unleſs the Doctor [<hi>Chandler</hi>] will allow me to ſuppoſe, that he poſſeſſes underſtanding but in a very low degree, which I would not chuſe to do, I muſt hold myſelf obliged to think, that he KNEW that this was neither a <hi>fair</hi> or <hi>full</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and that I had no reaſon to be ſatisfied with it, as NOTHING that I aſked, inſtead of EVERY THING, had been given me. Was it poſſible one of common diſcernment ſhould not perceive the groſs impertinence of Mr. <hi>Leam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in bringing to view a pretended SCRIPTURE inſtance of epiſcopal ordination, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I deſired, in as plain language as I could ſpeak, was one from the FATHERS of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church. Would the Doctor have thought
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011598_0040_0F877A656616BF68"/>
I had given a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>full</hi> anſwer to that affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, 'There is not an inſtance of ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for ſeveral ages,' if I had only ſaid, 'I might produce many, but for brevity's ſake ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but one inſtance,' and that is the ordination of <hi>Timothy</hi> by the laying on of the hands of the Preſbytery; producing only thoſe arguments that had been uſed an hundred times over to prove, that this was an ordination by Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? I am eſſentially miſtaken in the Doctor, and that convened body which firſt put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on writing, if they would not have laughed at the mention of ſuch an inſtance, in oppoſition to the above affirmation, and treated it with contempt as being altogether trifling. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, 'Is it not very extraordinary, that he (Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>) ſhould ſo roundly repeat the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand without the leaſt notice of Mr. <hi>Leaming</hi>'s anſwer?' The Doctor will not venture to ſay, he had not read the following words of mine concerning Mr. <hi>Leaming,</hi> in the letter prefixed to Mr. <hi>Welles</hi>'s anſwer to him, 'Was I inclined to engage in the epiſcopal controverſy, I ſhould chuſe for my opponent, one that is better able to manage a diſpute, than he appears to me to be.' This is ſufficient to account for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the demand, when ſo fair an occaſion was offered for it. The Doctor will doubtleſs think it ſufficient. And as to my doing this 'without taking the leaſt notice of Mr. <hi>Leam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>'s anſwer,' the plain truth is, I did not eſteem it worthy of the leaſt notice, or that any one elſe would, that had any conſiderable degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual diſcernment. Beſides, the Doctor knows Mr. <hi>Welles</hi> had wrote an anſwer to Mr. <hi>Leaming,</hi> in which he nullified this produced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011598_0040_0F877A656616BF68"/>
and all that was ſaid upon it; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſignifying to him, and to the Public that, the example of epiſcopal ordination wanted, and deſired, was to be ſelected, not from the <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but from one or another of the FATHERS of the two firſt centuries: Notwithſtanding which, the Doctor has carefully avoided a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with my demand; though repeatedly made, and ſo particularly explained as not to be capable of being miſunderſtood. How then could he, without bluſhing, go on, and ſay, 'I have ſometimes met with perſons who would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the arguments of <hi>others</hi> that had been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and the objections of <hi>others</hi> that had been confuted [He is himſelf an eminent inſtance of this] without taking notice of the ſaid anſwers and confutations; but Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> is the firſt man I have found in any of the regions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, that could, without any ſymptoms of perturbation, deal thus with <hi>his own</hi> arguments and objections, after they had been formally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and confuted.'—One cannot help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Doctor found himſelf greatly puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not knowing what to ſay. To give the deſired inſtance was not in his power—To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it was not, would have had an ill aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect on the cauſe he was defending—To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might have leſſened his reputation as the ſelected epiſcopal-champion. The beſt method therefore was to ſay ſomething, though it ſhould not be to the purpoſe; but to do it in the uſe of language that might lead ignorant readers to imagine, that he had effectually done the buſineſs. If the Doctor can give a better account of his conduct, let him do it.</p>
            <p>HE now knows, if he is capable of being made to know, that what I deſire is, an inſtance
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011598_0041_0F877A662FCB1F68"/>
of EPISCOPAL ORDINATION, in the appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſenſe, from ſome or other of the FATHERS within an hundred and fifty years from CHRIST. The demand, he owns 'is fair;' and it is modeſt likewiſe, as ONE INSTANCE ONLY is required, which he may fetch from any part of the then chriſtian world. He is either able to give an inſtance, or he is not. If he is able, let him do it; and I will frankly acknowledge, in the face of the world, that I have been miſtaken: If he is not able, let him as frankly and openly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and not divert his readers with telling them of <hi>curioſities</hi> and <hi>extraordinaries</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of controverſy, which have no exiſtence but as creatures of imagination. I ſhall only add, as I am in ſome ſollicitude for him, leſt he ſhould not be able, meerly of himſelf, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the deſired inſtance, I would adviſe him to call in the aid of the learned convention, of which he is a member; or if they ſhould not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, let him ſeek further help from any of the epiſcopal Clergy on the American Continent. It is really worth his while to be at ſome pains in this matter; for unleſs he produces the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded inſtance of ONE EPISCOPAL ordination, he cannot, with any tolerable face, in time to come, aſk for an example of ordination by PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTERS: Nor may he think he is at all wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we give no credit to his word, ſhould he hereafter ſay, as he has done, (p. 63) That 'we know, by the beſt hiſtorical evidence, that it has been the UNIVERSAL practice of the church, from the TIME OF THE APOSTLES TO THE PRESENT HOUR, TO ACKNOWLEDGE NONE for BISHOPS, WHO WERE NOT ORDAINED BY OTHER BISHOPS.' And for his encouragement I now publicly aſſure him, that I will receive as <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:011598_0041_0F877A662FCB1F68"/>
any inſtance he may be able to bring from the certainly <hi>ſpurious,</hi> or <hi>interpolated,</hi> epiſtles of IGNATIUS, the great oracle of Epiſcopalians.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor now comes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o conſider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> which I had mentioned in proof of ordination by Preſbyters. And he ſays here, in direct oppoſition to as known a truth as is contained in hiſtory, 'That the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were Epiſcopalians; yea, 'ſuch high-flyers that they claimed an uninterrupted ſucceſſion in a line of Biſhops as ſuperior to Preſbyters.' If he had affirmed this of the church of Scotland, it would not have been more diſtant from the truth. Nothing is more evident, than that, among the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> long before they had that name, and from the twelfth century when they were thus denominated, ordination was performed by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Paſtors, or Preſbyters, aſſembled in ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods; as may be ſeen in the account of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Paul Perrin</hi> of Lyons, under the head of diſcipline. Nay, that famous Epiſcopalian, Dr. <hi>Reignolds,</hi> who more than equalled in learning either <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Alix,</hi> peremptorily affirms, in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Sir <hi>Francis Knolls,</hi> that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were of the ſame opinion with <hi>Aerius</hi> as to the identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the order of Biſhops and Preſbyters. The unknown writer of the anſwer to Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> to whom the Doctor is obliged for his account of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> indeed ſays, 'They did affirm, that they had lawful Biſhops, and a lawful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles to this day'—But we all know the equivocal uſe of the name Biſhops; and that it may as well mean officers in the church of the ſame order with Preſbyters, as of a ſuperior order. In the latter ſenſe, the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> never pretended to have
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011598_0042_0F877A66D91BA490"/>
               <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of them from the Apoſtles, as is evident from the general ſtrain of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical hiſtory; in the former, they might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly affirm this. It is moſt probable this author, or the writer he quotes from, confounded the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> with the Bohemians; though it is not true, even in this view, that the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> ſpoken of, would be pleaſing to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. For the epiſcopacy of the Bohemian church was not ſuch an one as he is a ſtickler for. Says the learned <hi>Comenius,</hi> in his ratio diſciplinae fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Bohemorum, (p. 19, 20.) 'It is true, the Bohemians have certain Biſhops, or ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, who are conſpicuous for age and gifts, and choſen by ſuffrages of all the miniſters for the keeping of order, and to ſee that all the reſt do their office. Four, or five, or ſix ſuch have they, as need requires; and each of theſe has his dioceſs. But then the dignity of theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the other miniſters, is not founded in the prerogative of honours and revenues, but in that of labors and cares beyond others. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the canons of the Apoſtles, a Preſbyter and Biſhop are one and the ſame thing; only a Biſhop among them ſignifies an inſpector, or ſuperintendant: And therefore the Biſhops of the unity are in equal honour among themſelves, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that one of them preſides for the ſake of order.'—But I muſt not enlarge here. I may have ſaid too much already.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor concludes this ſection with a few feeble attempts to defend ſome part of what he had ſaid upon the ſubject of confirmation. Three texts he brought to view, in his appeal, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this rite of the church of England. I was particular in taking notice of each of them. To the firſt and third of theſe texts he has not
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011598_0042_0F877A66D91BA490"/>
ſeen fit, no doubt for a very good reaſon, to ſay a word. In anſwer to the ſecond, he complains of being 'accuſed of unfairly quoting a text of ſcripture; a crime (ſays he) which I hold in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence—I am ſorry Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> could think me capable of committing ſuch a flagrant act of impiety.' I have carefully looked over what he has offered to exculpate himſelf from the crime, he ſays, I had charged him with; and ſhall be glad, if the impartial Pubilc find reaſon to be ſatisfied, 'that he did not ſuppreſs the latter part of a text, becauſe if he had given the whole, it would have been at once viſible to the reader, that it would have been nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I will not ſay a word to weaken the effort he has made to clear up his character in this point; but willingly ſuffer it to be ſeen in its full force.</p>
            <p>IF the reader ſhall think it worth while to turn to the anſwer I was particular in making to the two objections againſt <hi>confirmation,</hi> the Doctor endeavoured, in his appeal, to remove out of the way, he may, perhaps, be let into the true reaſon why he paſſed over what was there offered in total ſilence.</p>
            <p>I CONCLUDED what I had to ſay, on the rite of <hi>confirmation,</hi> with an extract from the diſſenting Gentleman againſt Mr. <hi>White.</hi> The Doctor has thought it ſufficient to give us, in anſwer, the reply of Mr. <hi>White.</hi> And I ſhall think it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, in return, only to beg the reader to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this reply of Mr. <hi>White,</hi> with my extract from the diſſenting Gentleman; and if he can bring himſelf to think it worthy of the name of a reply, let him repair to what this ſame diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentleman has ſaid in anſwer to it, in his fifth ſection; more eſpecially that part of it
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:011598_0043_0F877A67A00BC7F8"/>
which is contained in p. 172, 173. He will then need nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urther to convince him, unleſs he is in a diſpoſition not to believe that the ſun ſhines, though he beholds it in its meridian luſtre.</p>
            <p>IT only remains here to aſſure the Doctor, in acknowledgment for his advice, that I have not the opinion of Mr. <hi>White</hi> that he has; eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him no more than a child in compariſon with Mr. <hi>Towgood</hi> And this, I believe, is the real ſentiment of all, in the impartial world, who have had opportunity to read their performances. As to Dr <hi>Grey,</hi> he was u doubtedly an inferior man, in all reſpects, to Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi>; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears to be ſo in his controverſy with him.</p>

Theſe topics of harangue, enlarged on in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, were particularly replyed to in the anſwer to it. The Doctor has ſaid little that is new or material in 'the defence' he has made.

            <p>I HAD ſeen fit to make two previous remarks. The firſt occaſioned by his ſaying, 'none but
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011598_0044_0F877A686E293AF0"/>
Biſhops have a right to govern the church, was to this purpoſe, 'That it was difficult, or rather impoſſible, to conceive how it ſhould be believed, that none but Biſhops have a right to govern the church, while it is believed, at the ſame time, that the King is the ſupreme Governor of it, according to the article [the Doctor] referred to, which declares that he hath the CHIEF POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER, the CHIEF GOVERNMENT in all eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cauſes.'—The only reply is, 'This matter has already been placed in ſo full and clear a light, that to enlarge upon it would be paying but an ill compliment to the reader's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.' I may rather with exact truth ſay, if would be an affront to his underſtanding to ſuppoſe, that he could imagine what had been ſaid, in p. 50 and a few pages onwards, relative to the King's ſupremacy, ſhould have the leaſt tendency to remove away this difficulty, which can be no otherwiſe done, than by making both parts of a moſt apparent contradiction true. It may be worthy of the reader's notice here, I had ſaid, from the ſeveral acts of Parliament, relative to the King's ſupremacy, that he is veſted with ALL POWER to exerciſe ALL MANNER of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical juriſdiction, and that Arch Biſhops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and all other eccleſiaſtical perſons, have NO MANNER of juriſdiction eccleſiaſtical but BY AND UNDER THE KING'S MAJESTY, who hath full power and authority to hear and determine ALL MANNER OF CAUSES ECCLESIASTICAL. To this the Doctor has not thought fit to ſay a word. I had alſo been particular in obſerving, 'That whatever authority the Clergy of the church of England, whether ſuperior or inferior, are veſted with, it is, in all its branches, reſtrained, by the STATE, within certain bounds, beyond
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011598_0044_0F877A686E293AF0"/>
which they have no authority: Inſomuch, that all the Clergy of the Kingdom, with the Biſhops at their head, have no conſtitutional right to make the leaſt deviation.' To all this, and much more of the like import, the Doctor has made no other anſwer, than by referring us to what he had ſaid in ſome preceeding pages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the King's ſupremacy, which is ſaying nothing, becauſe nothing is there attempted to be ſaid in reply to theſe difficulties. It will, I am apt to think, be at once obvious to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, why he did not chuſe to point out to us, how NONE BUT BISHOPS have a right to govern the church, when they are ſo far from being her ONLY Governors, that they are nothing more than SUBORDINATE rulers, and can do nothing in the church but according to the AUTHORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS of the King and his Parliament.</p>
            <p>THE other remark, as the Doctor has repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it, 'relates to the difference betwixt the complaint as made at the head of this ſection, and its appearance in the explanation that follows.' The reader here meets with a notable inſtance of his critical juſtice, and candid fairneſs, in ſo quoting my words as to find occaſion to remark upon them. For I had, in expreſs terms, made the difference between the complaint, and its after-vindication, to conſiſt, not meerly, or only, in what was ſaid 'at the head of this ſection;' but IN THAT PARAGRAPH, SOME WORDS OF WHICH [namely theſe, <hi>none but Biſhops have a right to govern the church</hi>] WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING. This eſſential part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked difference the Doctor has been pleaſed intirely to leave out in quoting my words; and unleſs he had been thus unfair, there would
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011598_0045_0F877A6920C05A88"/>
have been no propriety or pertinency in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply he has made to them: It is wholly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his unaccountably leaving that out, which he ought to have put in. He owns indeed, that he had ſaid, (ap p. 27) 'The American chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, while without Biſhops, muſt be without government;' upon which he ſays, 'If he [Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>] had this general expreſſion in his view' he did wrong in ſaying it was at the head of the ſection.' He is here chargeable with inexcuſable inattention, not to ſay any thing worſe. How otherwiſe could he have made the ſuppoſition, 'if he had this general expreſſion in view,? when, in pointing out the difference between the complaint, and its vindication, it was, in the moſt plain language, directly held out to view? His inſinuating, that 'I did wrong in ſaying it was at the head of, the ſection,' could be intended only to make way for the ſingularly beautiful piece of wit that follows, 'Few of his readers, I believe, would ever think of looking for the <hi>head</hi> of a thing in the <hi>middle</hi> of it.' One would naturally ſuppoſe, from ſo ſtriking a flight of fancy, that 'this general expreſſion' was to be found in the <hi>middle</hi> of the ſection; whereas, it is the very <hi>firſt</hi> thing, after what is briefly ſaid by way of introduction, that we meet with. It is not eaſy to conceive, how the Doctor came to call the <hi>head</hi> of a thing its <hi>middle</hi>; and upon a miſrepreſentation too, which any common reader might rectify upon ocular inſpection.</p>
            <p>HE goes on to ſay, with reference to this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral propoſition, without Biſhops the church of England in America muſt be without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, 'I took notice, that it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a qualified ſenſe: But ſurely there can he no inconſiſtency in this. It is very common,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:011598_0045_0F877A6920C05A88"/>
and agreeable to ſtrict method, firſt to lay down a general propoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, and then to mark out the exceptions and limitations with which it is to be underſtood.' It is neither common, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſtrict method or good ſenſe, to limit a propoſition that is not capable of limitation. The Doctor's propoſition is of this kind. Can there be government with exceptions and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, when all right to exerciſe government is denied, and for want of this right there is wretchedneſs and miſery? The complaint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not have been in abſolute terms, when a limited mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igated meaning only was intended. This is wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I aimed to ſhow in my remark, and principally with a view to give particular diſtinct notice to the reader, that it was in a 'qualified limited ſenſe only,' that I was called to conſider this complaint. It was accordingly in this qualified ſenſe that I did conſider it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of <hi>ordination</hi> as well as <hi>government,</hi> and in perfect conformity to the ſenſe in which the Doctor himſelf endeavoured to vindicate his own complaint. If the reader will only carry this in his mind, when he reads what he has ſaid (p. 101, 102) he will at once perceive, that the whole of it is a meer vain ſhew, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unworthy of any one who pretends to reaſon fairly. We ſhall examine what is here offered.</p>
            <p>SAYS he, 'As to ordination, the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is true without any exception. For without Biſhops, upon the principles of the church of England, there cannot be ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a fingle inſtance.' And what then? Who ever ſaid there could be an inſtance of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ordination without a Biſhop? He is here
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:011598_0046_0F877A69DE451D70"/>
beating the air, having no one living to contend with. He goes on, 'The Doctor [<hi>Chauncy</hi>] diſtinguiſhes; <hi>no ordination, and ordination with inconvenience and charge, are quite different things.</hi>' Who in his ſenſes ever thought, or ſaid other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Inſtead of 'laboring under a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ideas,' my antagoniſt muſt have no ideas but what are different from the ideas of all other perſons, if he can diſpute this. But, ſays he, 'The poſition which he controverts is this, that there can be no ordination in America, without Biſhops in America.' If he here means, that I diſpute whether epiſcopal ordination can be obtained by Americans, unleſs there are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in America; it is neither true, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his own vindication of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; or with my anſwer to it. If the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that I controvert this poſition, that no ordination can be performed by Biſhops in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> unleſs there are Biſhops here, he is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to point out the place in which I diſpute this, or was called upon by him to do ſo: If he cannot, he muſt be looked upon as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing himſelf, by endeavouring to bring me in diſputing as ſelf-evident a truth, as that two and two make four. He goes on, 'In oppoſition to which [the poſition, there can be no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in America without Biſhops in America] he argues, that we may have ordinations in America <hi>with inconvenience and charge</hi> But how can we, without Biſhops, have ordination in America? Why, ſays my very logical opponent, by having them in England.' The Doctor is here illogical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſenſible, that he is ſneering at himſelf. For it was HE that ſpake of <hi>inconvenience, danger,</hi> and <hi>charge,</hi> in having ordinations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s complaint upon the head of ordination. If therefore there is any thing ridiculous in ſaying, 'We may have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations in America by having them in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,' he only muſt bear the ridicule; for he is the only perſon that made this a matter of complaint; and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s more clamarous upon this ſuppoſed grievance than any other.</p>
            <p>AS he never once complained, that epiſcopal ordination could not be obtained; but ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I SHALL not think it improper to add here, notwithſtanding the Doctor, and a few others have made a mighty noiſe about 'having ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in America by having them in England,' and at a vaſt expence, and the hazard of life, there being no other way in which holy orders can be epiſcopally conferred on this ſide the Atlantic; I ſay, notwithſtanding this mighty outery, there are at leaſt two Biſhops now reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Britiſh America, one in the north, the other in the ſouth part of it, from either of which it is reaſonable to think, the epiſcopal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice might be conveyed, with incon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE Doctor will not eſteem it an objection of any weight againſt deriving the epiſcopal office
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:011598_0047_0F877A6AD079AAA8"/>
from the Canadian Biſhop, becauſe he is a PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISH one. For he has expreſsly aſſured us, (p. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) 'That he knows of no reaſon why OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS derived from the PAPISTS ſhould, on that account, be invalid, any more than arguments derived from them ſhould be ſo' And he knows alſo, for he has declared it, 'That the church of Rome, though an OLD HARLOT, even in the opinion of the church of England, may yet bring forth children, harlot as ſhe is, as well as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and virtuous ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the epiſcopal Clergy had been as zealous in their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the Biſhops in America, as they have been elſewhere, they might, without all doubt, have had one from among themſelves veſted with the epiſcopal powers of ordination and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment long before now.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor, in his 'appeal, p. 34, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the <hi>expence</hi> of a voyage to England for ordination; to which the reply was made that is contained in p. 82 of the 'appeal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.' This reply, however candid and juſt, gave occaſion to my being very ſcurrilouſly treated in one of the New-York periodical pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: And Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> himſelf, in his 'ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal defended,' has remarked upon it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner much below the gentleman, not to ſay the chriſtian divine. The reader will bear with me, while I ſet this matter in a clear and full point of light.</p>
            <p>IT was ſaid, in the 'appeal,' p. 34, 35, in order to repreſent the diſadvantage of being obliged to go to England for orders, 'That the expence of this voyage cannot be reckoned at leſs, upon an average, than one hundred pounds ſterling to each perſon. To men of fortune this is an inconſiderable ſum; but men
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011598_0048_0F877A6B577C44A0"/>
of fortune muſt not be expected to devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſervice of the church in America, when the proſpect is ſo diſcouraging, and ſo many diſagreeable circumſtances are known to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The expence muſt therefore gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fall upon ſuch, as having already expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt part of their pittance in their education, will find it extremely hard to raiſe a ſum ſufficient for the purpoſe' Theſe are the Doctor's words, and the whole of them. In reply hereto it was ſaid, 'appeal anſwered, p. 82, 'Anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r reaſon [that is, of the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage attending the affair of ordination] is, the expence of the voyage, which cannot be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned at leſs, upon an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is aggravated by the conſideration 'that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence muſt generally fall upon ſuch, as, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ready expended the greateſt part of their pittance in their education, will find it extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hard to raiſe a ſufficient ſum for the purpoſe.'

               </gap> remember, at the time of writing the account of the Society, publiſhed in 1706, in which they ſay, (p 74) 'All young ſtudents in thoſe parts (meaning the Colonies) who deſire epiſcopal ordination, are invited into England; and their EXPENCES in coming and returning are to be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e' that can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, unleſs abſurdly, but by the Society themſelves; and they can have no juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for complaint, as the money they expend in this way is as properly beſtowed, as in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the miſſionar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es themſelves.' This, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim, is what I ſaid, and all that I ſaid. Who
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:011598_0048_0F877A6B577C44A0"/>
could have imagined, that what is here offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſo candid a manner, without ſo much as an harſh or provoking word, ſhould have been made an handle for the baſe and injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections that have been caſt upon me!—But let us hear what the Doctor has ſaid, in his 'ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal defended.' Having owned, (p 124.) 'That I very candidly ſuppoſed he had never ſeen, or, if he had, did not remember, at the time of writing, the account of the Society, publiſhed in 1706;—he goes on to argue, 'The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made in the 'appeal' is, that the voyage is <hi>expenſive</hi>; the anſwer by Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly contrived to excite the idea, that it is not expenſive.' It is really unaccountable he ſhould be able to move his pen to write thus, when he could not but know, if in ſeeing he would ſee, that my anſwer, in the whole of it, was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſuppoſition that the voyage was attended with <hi>expence</hi>; nor is there a word in it, from whence it can be inferred, that I did not think this to be a certain truth. He proceeds, 'The complaint ſays, the expence, upon an average, is an hundred pounds ſterling to each perſon; the anſwer leads the reader to believe, that it is not a farthing.' He ſhould rather have ſaid, it leads the reader to believe, that it would not be a farthing, if the Society defrayed the charge conformably to the promiſe they publiſhed for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Colony-ſtudents to go to England for orders. And, as they have never revoked this promiſe that we non-epiſcopa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ans know of, (for ſuch revokation is no where contained, that we can find, in the publiſhed accounts of their proceedings) we ought, in honor to them, to ſuppoſe, that they, and not the ſtudents they
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:011598_0049_0F877A6E8BE44408"/>
have invited into England, are at the expence of the voyage, unleſs it is otherwiſe defrayed. He ſays yet further, 'But this is not the worſt of it; the anſwer appears to me to be <hi>artfully</hi> calculated to lead the reader alſo to believe ſomething further—namely, that concerning a plain matter of fact, with regard to which it is impoſſible any Miſſionary can be miſtaken, I publiſhed to the world an abſolute, wilful fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood; a falſhood, which was known to be ſuch, not only by every Miſſionary on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, but by every member of the Society both here and at home, and by every Biſhop in the Kingdom. So that I fear the Doctor really intended to lead his readers to believe me to have been in this matter, both a notorious liar, and abominably ſtupid. I have freely mentioned what I ſtrongly ſuſpect, and what I know to be ſuſpected by many others. If he can exculpate himſelf, I think it greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him to do it: Or if any of his friends can clear him, it is in their power to do him a moſt eſſential ſervice. Nothing leſs, in my opinion, can excuſe him to the world, and to his own conſcience, than proper evidence that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf believes, and has reaſon for believing, that I have actually been guilty of ſuch baſe and abſurd conduct, as his inſinuations manifeſtly imply'—It muſt, I ſhould think, appear to the reader, that the Doctor, inſtead of being 'very candid,' has diſcovered a total want of candor in what he has here ſaid. He expreſsly declares, 'That I had very candidly ſuppoſed, he had not ſeen, or did not remember, the Society's engagement in 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>06; and yet, in direct contradiction to this acknowledged candor, he would lead the reader to think, that it was my intention to
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:011598_0049_0F877A6E8BE44408"/>
repreſent him as an abominably ſtupid liar. It was in truth my real deſign, explicitly as well as candidly ſignified, to guard him againſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any ſuch thought. What other imaginable end could I have had in view? I ſhould have acted the part, not of an 'art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calculator,' but of a weak ſilly perſon, to have made the ſuppoſition, the Doctor himſelf calls a 'very candid one,' if it had been my intention to make the reader believe he was 'a notorious liar,' as having publiſhed a known wilful falſhood. What ſhould lead him 'ſtrongly to ſuſpect' this was my deſign, I am not able to conjecture, unleſs he felt within himſelf a conſciouſneſs of guilt in this matter; which might be the caſe. For though I neither ſaid, nor intended to ſay it before, I ſay it now in plain words, that he did not declare the truth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'impoſſible it was that any Miſſionary ſhould miſtake in ſo plain a matter of fact,' if he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make his readers believe, agreeably to the evident import of his words, 'That the expence of the voyage to England for orders, was, to each perſon,' out of his own pocket, without exception, 'one hundred pounds ſterling.' I am ſure he did not know this to be true, becauſe I know it to be falſe: Nor does any Miſſionary on the Continent know it to be true, becauſe the conſciences of ſome of them will tell them to their faces, that pious donations have wholly, or in great part, defrayed the expence of their going home for holy orders. It is indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in theſe parts, however it may be where the Doctor reſides, for candidates to be much aſſiſted in their voyage: I believe there are thoſe, who have croſſed the Atlantic for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, without being at any epxence of their
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:011598_0050_0F877A6F2AFC3238"/>
own. It does not therefore belong to me, but to the Doctor, to 'exculpate himſelf.' or to get ſome friend to do it for him: Nor otherwiſe can he 'excuſe himſelf to the world, or his own conſcience,' for what he has here publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that is not agreeable to truth. How far he might do this 'wilfully,' or 'ſtupidly' or 'no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly,' or 'abominably,' is beſt known to himſelf; though I am ſo candid as to think, that he did it rather through want of due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which is a fault he is too apt to be betrayed into.</p>
            <p>HE has been pleaſed, in a note, at the bottom of p. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, to inſert the following words, 'The author of a <hi>fictitious</hi> letter from <hi>a member of the Society,</hi> which has been publiſhed in one of the New-York papers has endeavoured to vindicate Doctor <hi>Chauncy</hi> from the charges of falſhood and inſincerity, which had been brought againſt him [in another of theſe papers] on account of his conduct in this affair. But, unleſs he ſhould have the good luck to meet with an abler and fairer advocate, his reputation muſt ſuffer, wherever the caſe ſhall be known.' I cannot help ſaying here, I did not think Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> was ſo little of a Gentleman as to inſinuate to to the Public, from the ſcurrilous writer in <hi>Gaines</hi>'s Gazette, that I was 'chargeable with falſhood in this affair,' and to declare 'my reputation muſt ſuffer, unleſs I met with an abler and fairer advocate, than that member of the ſociety,' who wrote in my vindication.' He knew, as he had eyes to ſee, that this charge of falſhood brought againſt me was grounded upon a <hi>falſe</hi> repreſentation of what I had ſaid— He knew alſo, that neither that writer, or any other, to this day, has ſo much as attempted to
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:011598_0050_0F877A6F2AFC3238"/>
return an anſwer to what was offered by my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate to juſtify me againſt this charge—And he knew further, that, as 'good luck' would have it, 'ſo able and fair an advocate,' as Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> himſelf, has appeared in my vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For he has declared, in expreſs words, (p. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) 'That the Society publiſhed ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invitation, in 1706, I believe to be true.' How then could he endeavour to lead the Public to believe, that it was falſe? Is this conſiſtent with that honeſt fairneſs which might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be expected from one who profeſſes to be a chriſtian Divine.</p>
            <p>IT may deſerve the reader's ſpecial notice, though the Doctor would, from a <hi>fictitous</hi> writer, inſinuate, that I was chargeable with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, he has not ventured, in his own reply, to exhibit ſuch a charge. Inſtead of this, his charge is, that I had artfully endeavoured to make the reader believe, that HE had been guilty of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood. He ſays not a word tending to faſten falſhood upon me; but his zeal is wholly ſpent in throwing blame upon me for leading the Public, as he imagines, to think, that I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repreſent him as 'a notorious wilful liar.' How ſtrangely different is the charge the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has brought againſt me, from that he refers to in the margin? And how unaccountably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent is he with himſelf, in mentioning this latter charge as hurtful to my reputation, when he has himſelf declared it to be falſe? For this is the meaning of his acknowledgment, 'that the Society publiſhed ſuch an invitation, in 1706, I believe to be true.'</p>
            <p>HAVING made this acknowledgment, he goes on to repreſent the 'invitation of the Society' as nothing to my purpoſe. Says he, 'It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

that it was only occaſional.'—Very true; but what was the occaſion? The reader will be beſt able to judge from the invitation itſelf, which I ſhall here inſert at large; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Public may, from what they ſhall ſee with their own eyes, be indiſputably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that I have been treated with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:011598_0051_0F877A7013395748"/>FROM theſe extracts, it appears, with a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian luſtre, that the Society wanted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Colony Miſſionaries, and that this was the OCCASION of their publiſhing their invitation, wherein they PROMISE to defray the EXPENCE of ſuch as ſhall be inclined to go home for holy orders: and this 'invitation' and 'promiſe' were, without all doubt, communicated in the 'letter' that was prepared to be ſent to the EPIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COPAL CLERGY, that they might communicate them to the Colony-ſtudents for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to go home for ordination. And it is obſervable, five or ſix years after the firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the 'account' in which this invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and promiſe are contained, it was agreed and ordered by the Society, that it ſhould be RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRINTED to promote the ſucceſs of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Who now can ſuppoſe, that the printed and reprinted INVITATION and PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISE of the Society ought not to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an obligation lying on them, in point of honour and juſtice, to defray the expence of the voyage to England for orders, unleſs it is made known to them that it has been defrayed ſome other way?</p>
            <p>BUT, ſays the Doctor, before the firſt candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m this Country went home for holy orders, the invitation was recalled, or rather had expired.' He would do well to tell us, how it ſhould expire, if it was not recalled. And let him, if he can, produce its revokation in any account the Society have given of their proceedings. Until he is able to do this, he muſt excuſe us Non-epiſcopalians, if we are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſee, but that the Society is STILL as ſtrongly obliged as ever to make good their PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISE to the Colony-ſtudents, unleſs it may have
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:011598_0052_0F877A719A70BCE0"/>
been vacated in any inſtances by the payment of the expence of the voyage by their epiſcopal friends here. The Doctor may, if he pleaſes, call this invitation of the Society an 'antiquated' one, and compare it to 'one of the Engliſh ſtatutes againſt the <hi>Lollards</hi>;' but it is eaſy to perceive, that he here ſubſtitutes laughter in the room of ſober argument, and for a very good reaſon no doubt. He would juſtify the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as 'antiquated' by ſaying, 'That neither the firſt candidates that went home for holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor any of their ſucceſſors, <hi>ſo far as I can learn,</hi> have received benefit from it.' This, if true, is really ſtrange, and reflects no ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor on the Society. But the Doctor, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, may in time make higher attainments in learning of this kind, than he is at preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, and find that both the 'firſt candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,' and 'ſome of their ſucceſſors' too, have received benefit from this invitation and promiſe of the Society. I am the rather diſpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that this is the truth of the caſe, from that reſpect which is due to ſo venerable a body of men; and aſſure the Doctor, though he
<q>has ſo publicly and boldly aſſerted</q>
the contrary, it has no influence to put me upon 'ſuſpecting my own ignorance' in this matter. For it is no infrequent thing with him to affirm that, both 'publicly and boldly' which he never would have done, had it not been for want of more knowledge.</p>
            <p>HE very juſtly aſſures the Public, (p. 153) That 'I will not allow that the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, in the Colonies, is diſtinguiſhed and ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſed by a want of thoſe religious privileges, which are granted to all other denominations;' and for this very good reaſon, becauſe 'Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:011598_0052_0F877A719A70BCE0"/>
are allowed the ſame liberty with all other perſuaſions, and do, with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from moleſtation, worſhip GOD in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe way they themſelves are pleaſed to chuſe:' Upon which he cries out, 'Can he be ſerious when he ſays this? Or does he mean to inſult us?' I mean to inſult no body; but I ſeriouſly ſpake a real truth. 'Is it the truth, that we have the ſame <hi>liberty</hi> with all other perſuaſions?' I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it is the exact truth. 'Do not they all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their own religious ſyſtems compleatly, and in every part? But can this be predicated of the church of England?' If it cannot, it is not ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any want of liberty, but to their not uſing that liberty which is equally granted to all deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations without diſtinction. 'We complain that we are deſtitute of the power of ordination, and are not allowed to enjoy ſeveral of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our church, which we hold in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and veneration'. The anſwer is ſhort and eaſy. Epiſcopalians are as much allowed, as other denominations, to procure for themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Should it be ſaid, their principles reſtrain them from the procurement of apoſtolic Epiſcopacy in any way but from the King or ſtate, and by being diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all the other Colony-denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: In this caſe, the reply was given in the anſwer to the appeal, in theſe words, 'It is from their principles only that they are hamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with difficulties.' The Doctor, upon this, has diſcovered, as he had often done before, that his peculiar talent is not that of reaſoning. He can perceive no difference between difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſuffered upon principle, in conſequence of the non-beſtowment of diſtinguiſhing favour, and difficulties that are ſuffered for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the arbitrary, tyrannical precepts of men, in violation of the rights of conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, he would make us believe, that difficulties ſuffered, upon principle, through want of a grant of favour, may, with as much pertinency, be complained of, as any of the tortures the Saints of the Moſt High have been harraſſed with, for their adherence to their GOD, from
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:011598_0053_0F877A7238556AD0"/>
the greateſt perſecutors that ever exiſted. I ſhall only ſay here, for once borrowing the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's own polite words, 'This is the weakeſt of all the weak things he has ſaid.'</p>
            <p>IT was obſerved, ap. anſ. p. 130, 131, 'That the Non-epiſcopalian Clergy and Laity, in the town of Boſton, in one week only, ſubſcribed two thouſand pounds ſterling for a fund to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Miſſionaries among the Indian natives, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition there might be an incorporated ſociety among themſelves for conducting and managing this important affair; that an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating act was prepared, and paſſed by the ſeveral branches of the government here, and ſent home for the Royal ſanction, without which it could not continue in force: But that it ſoon met with a negative, by means of which this whole money was loſt, and as much more we had good reaſon to expect would be ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.' This was complained of as a great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And it was then added, 'We ſhould eſteem the hardſhip much greater, if, in any meaſure, it was brought upon us by EPISCOPAL influence. I will not too poſitively ſay it was; but this I will ſay, and in the words of a letter from home.'—The words were inſerted at large. What now ſays the Doctor? Inſtead of taking the leaſt notice of this letter, he mentions it, from one he calls the very ſenſible author of a vindication of the Biſhop of Landaff's ſermon, as 'an utter improbability, that a number of eminently pious men, who have the converſion of the Savages much at heart, would oppoſe ſuch a meaſure for that purpoſe' I am hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry I am obliged to ſay, that this 'num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eminently pious men' have given the Public ſo little reaſon to think, that they have the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:011598_0054_0F877A72E0507600"/>
converſion of the Savages much at heart.' Had this been the real truth, it is impoſſible but they ſhould have done much more than they have ever yet done to promote their converſion. They have made it abundantly evident, that they had at heart the PROPAGATION OF EPIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COPACY, much more than the 'converſion of the Savages;' and, if we may be permitted to judge from their conduct, we ſhall naturally, and almoſt neceſſarily, be obliged to think, they would be in readineſs to oppoſe any plan for the converſion of the Savages, that did not propoſe to convert them by EPISCOPISING them. He ſubjoins, from the ſame very ſenſible author, an extract of a letter, from o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the <hi>moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant</hi> members of the Society to his friend in this Country, in which it is ſaid, 'The plan, as preſented, was liable to ſeveral objections; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that the members were to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table only to themſelves. However, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety made NO OPPOSITION TO IT.' It was not ſaid, the Society, in their character as ſuch, made oppoſition to our incorporating act. It may be true, as this letter declares, that the Society made no oppoſition; but it may be as true, notwithſtanding what is here affirmed, that ſome of its members, and its moſt important ones too, in their private capacity, might oppoſe it with their whole influence. The Doctor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo brings in Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> 'after enquiry upon the ſpot' as ſaying, 'I can affirm upon very good authority, that neither the <hi>Society,</hi> nor any <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> AS SUCH, oppoſed the act of the Boſton aſſembly.'—This may be true, and not inconſiſtent with the account that has been given us by others, who were upon the ſpot as well as Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> and as capable of
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:011598_0054_0F877A72E0507600"/>
making enquiry as he can be ſuppoſed to be. The letter the Doctor has paſſed over in ſilence ſays, 'There is reaſon to think, an account of the incorporating act was ſent to LAMBETH as early as to—The Arch-Biſhop was prejudic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed —Umbrage was taken at the new ſociety— The leaſt attempt to take ſubſcriptions here would have blown up the ſuſpicions of the church, and ſociety, into an open ſlame.' This account we had from one, who, to ſay the leaſt, was under as good advantages, as Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> to know the truth of the affair. And it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s affirmation is deſignedly worded with particular guard and caution. 'Neither the <hi>Society,</hi> nor any Epiſcopalians, AS SUCH, oppoſed the act.' No one ever ſaid, the <hi>Society,</hi> AS SUCH, made oppoſition; though, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what is here affirmed, ſome of its members, and even the Arch-Biſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, its Preſident, might be in the oppoſition: And it may, in like manner, be true, that Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians might uſe their influence againſt the paſſing this act, though they might not do it AS SUCH. His ſaying, 'it was rejected upon po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical and commercial reaſons, when there was not one Biſhop preſent,' may, to weak minds, have a plauſible appearance; but the diſguiſe is thin, and eaſily ſeen through. It was never imagined, had there been EPISCOPAL influence, but that it would be kept out of ſight, in the management of the affair at the board of trade. They muſt been blunderers in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eed, if they could not have aſſigned ſome other reaſons of their conduct, than that they had been applied to by Biſhops, or an Arch-Biſhop, though not in their capacity as members of the Society, or as veſted with the epiſcopal office. The Doctor now
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:011598_0055_0F877A73D17256D0"/>
ſpeaks of my taking no notice of 'ſo clear and full evidence of the Society's innocence, as one of the ſtrange modern phenomena, which admit not of an eaſy ſolution.' It is at once ſolved by only ſaying, it was none of my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take notice of this evidence, until he had produced it; upon which I have made it very plainly to appear, that, inſtead of being 'clear and full evidence,' it is in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eality no evidence at all. The reader will, I believe, think it very extraordinary, in the Doctor, to call me to an account for taking no notice of evidence he had not laid before me, and knew not that I had ever ſeen, while, at the ſame time, he is himſelf chargeable with taking no notice of the letter he had placed before his eyes, containing much ſtronger counter-evidence. I will not account for this, by ſuppoſing 'he wrote in a hurry, and did not give himſelf time for recollection:' A much better reaſon may be aſſigned, namely, his finding himſelf unable to return a juſt anſwer to the contents of ſo material a letter.</p>
            <p>MANY other things, contained in this part of the Doctor's defence are juſtly liable to excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he deſires 'the controverſy may be brought into a narrower compaſs; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I imagine, will think with me, that it would be needleſs to take any further notice of what is here ſaid, as being remote from the GRAND POINT in diſpute.

            <head>Reply to Dr. CHANDLER's Eighth Section.</head>
            <p>THE Doctor comes, in this ſection, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate the objections that had been brought againſt the propoſed plan for an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican-Epiſcopate. And here it might have been expected to find him exerting himſelf <hi>with</hi> the greateſt vigor and ſtrength. But we are greatly diſappointed. He diſcovers leſs ſpirit, and is leſs convincing, in what he has offered upon this MAIN POINT in controverſy, than in any part of his performance. He ſeems indeed to have kept this GRAND OBJECT out of ſight as long as he could, if we may judge from the 198 pages he wrote before he came to it. And it would have been, perhaps, as much to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, if he had wholly paſſed it over in ſilence, unleſs what he has ſaid had carried more weight with it.</p>
            <p>BEFORE he enters upon the conſideration of the objections to the epiſcopal plan for Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, he takes notice of two or three other things, which muſt detain us a while.</p>
            <p>IN the 'appeal anſwered,' in a marginal note at the bottom of p. 133, mention was made of a copy, that had appeared in one of the public news-papers, of the petition that was ſent by a
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:011598_0056_0F877A745C7BE2A8"/>
number of epiſcopal Clergymen to the Univerſity at Cambridge, in which ſome things juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable were pointed out. The Doctor's reply is, 'I can and do aſſure him [Dr. <hi>Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>] that it is fictitious and falſe; and that the Convention ſent home no ſuch addreſs, nor any that contained ſimilar expreſſions with theſe he cenſures.' I alſo can and do aſſure Dr. <hi>Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We might then have judged for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not been put upon yielding implicit faith in his bare word; which though true in his own apprehenſion, might poſſibly be otherwiſe in the view of others. Whatever the Doctor, or the Convention may think, it carries with it no good aſpect, that they ſo reſolutely keep ſecret their petitions, when copies of them have been deſired; putting us off by telling us, they do not contain that in them which we have heard they do, and in ſuch ways that we ſhall believe what we have heard, until we have opportunity to ſee with our own eyes.</p>
            <p>IT was ſaid, ap. anſw. p. 135, 'Some of the moſt reſpectable Epiſcopalians, in theſe parts, for ſobriety, good ſenſe, and a ſteady attachment to the intereſt of the church of England, have declared it to be their opinion, that Biſhops would be of no ſervice here, and that they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they ſhould be ſent.' The Doctor, upon this, affects to be at a loſs to know what 'pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar idea' I intended to convey by the phraſe 'reſpectable Epiſcopalians;' which could not eaſily be accounted for in any other perſon, as I was particular in repreſenting them reſpectable 'for their ſobriety, good ſenſe, and ſteady at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:011598_0056_0F877A745C7BE2A8"/>
to the church of England.' He is much puzled to underſtand the meaning of the 'indefinite word, SOME;' whether I intended by it 'two, or two hundred.' It could not well have been 'impoſſible' for him to have known my meaning, in the uſe of this innocent word, if he had only allowed himſelf to read the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following ſentence. 'And it is to me, as well as to MANY I have converſed with upon this head, EPISCOPALIANS among others, very queſtionable, whether, if the members of the church of England, in theſe northern Colonies, were to give their votes, and to do it without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious CLERICAL influence, they would be found to be on the ſide of an American Epiſcopate.' One might 'poſſibly' have gueſſed at what I meant by the word, SOME, after this explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of myſelf. But the Doctor choſe rather to make a ſhew of being witty, than to argue; though his wit is wholly grounded upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial repreſentation of what I had ſaid. He goes on, 'I queſtion whether there is an Epiſcopalian on the Continent, either of a more or leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable character, including in it ſome degree of attachment to the intereſt of the church, that has objected againſt an Epiſcopate upon the plan of the appeal.'—What he here ſays, put into plain Engliſh, is this; he queſtions whether truth can be ſpoken unleſs by himſelf, and a few others who ſpeak as he would have them. But why does he queſtion, whether any Epiſcopalian has objected to an Epiſcopate upon his plan? The reaſon is, becauſe 'he muſt act a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, inconſiſtent part. For how abſurd is it for a man, who is attached to the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland in America, not to wiſh its ſoundneſs and health?' And here he goes on repeating, in a
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:011598_0057_0F877A7537AA8CA0"/>
way of argument, what he had often urged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in favour of his American Epiſcopate. But what is all this to the point? It is a <hi>fact,</hi> not a <hi>ſpeculative truth,</hi> we are now upon. And the Doctor muſt know, unleſs he is a great ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the world, that <hi>facts</hi> and <hi>ſpeculative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> do not always harmoniſe with each other. Beſides, where is the difficulty in ſuppoſing, that moſt Epiſcopalians on the Continent may have a quite different notion of the plan for an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Epiſcopate, from that the EPISCOPAL CLERGY have of it, who were its ONLY FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERS, and the ONLY PETITIONERS that it might be carried into execution? Might they not be apprehenſive of danger from a plan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by the CLERGY, and ſent home for rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, without their conſent, or being applied to for it? Surely, it is not impoſſible they ſhould think, notwithſtanding all the Doctor has ſaid, that the miſſion of Biſhops into the Colonies would do more hurt than good. This, I know, is, in fact, the opinion of MANY Lay-epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians, and, I believe, of the greater part of them in the New-England Colonies. I ſhall only add here, ſpeculative arguments are no more ſuted to invalidate the truth of this fact, than they would be to prove that there were no Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians on the Continent. For it would be a much eaſier taſk to prove it ſpeculatively abſurd there ſhould be any, than that they ſhould be againſt the propoſed Epiſcopate.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor animadverts upon nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until he comes to p. 138, where he ſays, that 'I objected to their plan becauſe I thought it had been illegally ſettled.' And for aught any thing he has proved to the contrary, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the plan, for this reaſon, ſtands firm and
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:011598_0057_0F877A7537AA8CA0"/>
unſhaken. He ſays, 'I take it for granted, that what has been done by our friends and ſuperiors at home relating to it [the plan] has been done without the King's approbation.' And well I might, as we were told of a ſcheme for the miſſion of Biſhops to the Colonies, ſettled by Clergymen at home, and approbated by Clergymen here, to the <hi>intire n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>glect of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> without whoſe LICENCE, not even the CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOCATION have any right to ſettle ſuch a plan, or ſo much as ATTEMPT to form it. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor allows, 'that the two houſes of Convocation have no authority, without a ROYAL LICENCE, to attempt, enact, promulge, or execute any canon, by whatever name it might be called, which ſhould concern either doctrine or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.' But ſays he, 'This notwithſtanding, the Clergy, even in convocation, are ſtill, in ſeveral <hi>inferior</hi> inſtances, left perfectly free.' It would be ſtrange, if they were not. But how does this prove, that they are 'left perfectly free' in ſuch SUPERIOR inſtances as the ſettlement of a plan for the new modelling the power of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops? The King's ſupremacy, as head of the church, is not more nearly concerned in any ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical affair whatever. He goes on, 'The two houſes of Parliament cannot, without a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al licence attempt, enact, promulge, or execute any ſtatute, more legally than the two houſes of Convocation can enact a canon' This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed very much as it would have been by one who did not underſtand the proper rights of Parliament. If the thing meant is, that the two houſes of Parliament, and the two houſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, are under the ſame conſtitutional reſtraint, he is entirely miſtaken. The two houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are perfectly at liberty, without any Royal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:011598_0058_0F877A75EE1B40D0"/>
not only to ATTEMPT, but actually to form, any ſtatute, plan or canon, in order to its being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, promulged, and executed in conſiſtency with the conſtitution: Whereas the two houſes of Convocation are reſtrained, by the ſtatute of the twenty-fifth of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, called the act of ſubmiſſion, from ſo much as ATTEMPT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING any law, or canon, or whatever other name may be given to it, without LICENCE FIRST GRANTED TO THEM BY THE KING; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in virtue of his licence, agreed on any can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or conſtitution, they are not permitted to PUBLISH it, until it has obtained his confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Burn</hi>'s Eccleſ. law, under the word <hi>Convocation.</hi>
               </note> And if it is accounted inconſiſtent with the King's ſupremacy in eccleſiaſtical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for even the <hi>Convocation</hi> to ATTEMPT to form, ſettle, or publiſh a plan for the regulation of the church, without his GRANTED PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISSION, though, in ſo doing, they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the higheſt regard to 'the public good;' it ought certainly to be eſteemed much more ſo for other Clergymen to do this, eſpecially in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies convened for the purpoſe, not by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the King, but of their own heads: And it makes no alteration in the caſe, whether they are ſuperior or inferior Clergymen, or a mixture of both, unleſs in the degree of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that is hereby reflected on his Majeſty as, under GOD, the ſupream head of the church. They may ſpeak of themſelves as 'conſulting the public happineſs,' and doing it 'with the utmoſt fidelity,' and all 'deference and ſubmiſſion to the wiſdom of government;' but time was, when they would, notwithſtanding ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment on themſelves, have been called 'diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected aſſociations,' and as ſuch been 'ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed;' as has often been the caſe.</p>

               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:011598_0058_0F877A75EE1B40D0"/>THE Doctor takes occaſion here perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to declare, 'That I have pronounced all conſultations of their Biſhops for the intereſt of religion to be, in general, an infringement of the King's ſupremacy, unleſs a licence for that purpoſe is formally granted from the Crown.' He has been ſo wiſe as not to refer to the page in which I ſay this; and until he is pleaſed to do it, I ſhall think myſelf at full liberty to eſteem what he has offered as a groſs miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</p>
            <p>HE ſeems to look upon 'conſultations for the intereſt of religion,' and laying plans for a new regulation of the power of Biſhops, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of diſcipline in the church of England, as meaning one and the ſame thing. But he ought to have known, that NO ROYAL LICENCE is made neceſſary for conſultations to promote the general intereſt of religion; whereas, even the whole body of the Clergy, ſuperior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, are not permitted, though legally aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Convocation, ſo much as to ATTEMPT a plan for new modelling, in any part, the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical conſtitution, without a LICENCE for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally granted herefor by the King. Can it then be ſuppoſed allowable, for a <hi>deputiſed Clergyman</hi> to proclaim it to the world, without the leaſt hint of any GRANTED LICENCE from the King, that ſuch a plan has been 'privately formed and ſettled by ſome ſuperior Clergymen at home, and approbated by the epiſcopal Clergy here,' and in convened bodies for the purpoſe?—He would now ſuggeſt, 'That the King had been conſulted, and given undoubted proofs of his approbation of the meaſure.' Why then was not the plan introduced with particular notice of ſo important a point of deference to the Royal
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:011598_0059_0F877A76AF5B5E08"/>
ſupremacy? Was it more proper to tell the Public, that the epiſcopal Clergy here were agreed in this plan, than that his Majeſty had approbated it? And why is there not now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in form ſome authentic proof of the KING's LICENCE to contrive and publiſh the plan we have had held out to view? This would have been much more ſatisfactory, than barely to inſinuate, or ſay, 'That it had been honoured with the King's approbation.'</p>
            <p>SENSIBLE, I ſuppoſe, of the inſufficiency of all that had before been offered, the Doctor now gives us the following very extraordinary infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Says he, 'The charter granted to the Society for propagating the goſpel, has the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and efficacy of a commiſſion.' For what? Why, 'by this charter, or commiſſion, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are warranted to concert meaſures, and to ſettle plans, for the carrying on the deſign of that incorporation in the moſt effectual manner.'

               </gap>; but was it any part of the deſign of that incorporation to 'ſettle plans' for a new modelled church of England? The Doctor is, I believe, the firſt man that ever dreamed of a 'Royal commiſſion' in the Society's charter, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering its members to contrive ſchemes for governing t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="unknown:011598_0059_0F877A76AF5B5E08"/>
Royal ſupremacy. For it is not meerly a plan for ſending Biſhops to America, that is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent herewith; but a plan that propoſes their miſſion to carry on the buſineſs of eccleſiaſtical government and diſcipline in a manner quite different from that which is enjoined by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the King and Parliament. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed plan, as 'reſumed and digeſted with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar attention;' is of this ſort; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a direct violation of the ſeventy-third can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which enjoins, 'That no Prieſts, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of GOD's word, nor any other perſons ſhall meet together in any private houſe, or elſewhere, to conſult upon any matter, or courſe to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them, or upon their motion, or direction by others, which may any way tend to the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching,</hi> or <hi>depraving</hi> of the doctrine of the church of England, or of the book of common prayer, or of any part of the government or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline now eſtabliſhed in the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, under pain of excommunication <hi>ipſo fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi>' The Doctor ſays here, 'Whoever knows any thing of the hiſtory of the times in which the canon was framed, muſt be ſenſible that it was deſigned againſt a very <hi>different ſort</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from thoſe ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed bodies for the purpoſe, they are chargeable with the very crime this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was deſigned to guard againſt; and it is more aggravated in them, than in 'the different ſort of perſons' it might be ſuppoſed would be liable to condemnation by it. He adds, 'And as it was deſigned againſt a very different ſort of perſons, ſo the words of it <hi>clearly point out
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:011598_0060_0F877A7772574C70"/>
a very different conduct.</hi>' The conduct of the perſons concerned in the forming and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this plan, is as like that pointed out and condemned, in the canon, as words can make it. There has been 'the meeting together of Prieſts and others;'—they have met together 'in private houſes or elſewhere;—and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their meeting was 'to conſult upon a courſe to be taken by them, or upon their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,' in order to affect an alteration 'in ſome part of the <hi>government,</hi> or <hi>diſcipline,</hi> now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the church of England:' which, without all diſpute, is the very fault intended to be teſtified againſt in the canon. There is no way, indeed, in which this eſtabliſhed mode of government in the church of England can be more directly and effectually <hi>impeached,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,</hi> than by practical endeavours to get it changed. And it will not be pretended, that this is not the tendency of the propoſed and publiſhed plan. Whether the 'combinations and conſultations,' to this end, 'are factious,' or not, muſt be determined by the canon itſelf; which certainly ſuppoſes them to be ſo.</p>
            <p>I SAID, in my anſwer to the appeal, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed plan 'is a plan for altering the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline of the church of England in the Colonies.' To which the Doctor replies, 'Does he then believe the canon was intended to ſecure the government and diſcipline of the church of England in the Colonies? Without this intention the propoſal of any alteration in the form of eccleſiaſtical government here can be no violation of the canon.' Why do Colony-epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians glory in being members of the church of England, if there is no church of England here. And if there is, it is as as reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:011598_0060_0F877A7772574C70"/>
the canon was intended to guard its eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed form of government againſt <hi>impeachment</hi> or <hi>depravation</hi> here, as at home. But, ſays the Doctor, 'What is the nature and tendency of the alteration propoſed? Is it to deprave the government of the church of England at home? No; it is in reality to honour it, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring the government of the church here much nearer to her pattern, than it is, or can be, while deſtitute of Biſhops.' One, having no biaſs on his mind, would not think it reflected much honour on the government of the church at home to make alterations and amendments in it, before it is thought fit to be exerciſed here. And the ſuppoſed alteration moſt certainly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves</hi> it, as it reſtrains Biſhops from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that government over the <hi>Laity,</hi> they are entitled to, not only from the grant of the King and Parliament, but, as the Doctor believes, of JESUS CHRIST and his Apoſtles. He goes on, 'Nor is the plan for a different mode of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate for the church of America, any <hi>impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of that under which it exiſts in England.' The propoſing, and endeavouring, an alteration eſſentially carries in it the idea of an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is not poſſible it ſhould be altered without being impeached. What imaginable reaſon can there be for a change in any mode of government, unleſs it be ſuppoſed, inſufficient, imperfect, and not ſutable to be exerciſed, in thoſe reſpects at leaſt, wherein a change is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and endeavoured. And this is the very thing here meant by its being <hi>impeached.</hi> But, ſays the Doctor, 'As to ſuch externals, the church of England has always allowed them to be things that are alterable, and that they ought to be altered, according to the circumſtances and

            <p>THE reader will, perhaps, by this time be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed rather to wonder, than 'laugh,' at the Doctor's 'audaciouſneſs' in making ſo light of the 'fulminations' of an eſtabliſhed canon againſt <hi>impeaching,</hi> or <hi>depraving</hi> the conſtitutional go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and diſcipline of the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.

            <p>THE way being thus prepared, we now come to the GRAND POINT in debate, the propoſed plan for an American Epiſcopate. According to the Doctor's deſire, in his 'appeal to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,' objections were brought againſt this plan. He has endeavoured in his 'ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eal defended,' to take off the force of them. We ſhall impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:011598_0061_0F877A781B7F4E80"/>
examine what he has ſaid upon each ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection diſtinctly.</p>
            <p>OBJECTION I. 'The government and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the church of England, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed American Epiſcopate, is injurious both to the church, and the Biſhops that are to preſide over it.'</p>
            <p>'IT is injurious to the church.' And why? 'Becauſe it is to operate on the Clergy only. The lay-members of the church of England may not be favoured with the benefit of the governing authority of the Biſhops to be ſent.' What ſays the Doctor in reply? He reaſons thus, 'If the Laity are not to be affected by the Biſhops au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they are certainly not to be injured by it; that which does not operate at all, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no effect either injurious, or beneficial. With regard therefore to the exerciſe of diſcipline o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Laity, no benefit is propoſed, and no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is to be feared.' Is this a fit anſwer for the public view? Are not Biſhops appointed, in the ſenſe even of the church of England, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Laity, as truly as the Clergy? Are not the Laity as capable of receiving benefit from Epiſcopal authority, duly exerciſed, as the Clergy? And if they are capable of being bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by the exerciſe of this authority, muſt they not be injured, if a ſtop is put to its operation, in relation to them? Its not being permitted to operate at all, in regard of them, is, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, injurious, and in proportion to the greatneſs of the benefit that is loſt by this non-permiſſion. No one, I believe, before the Doctor ever ſaid, it was not injurious to deprive the Laity of a ſpiritual priviledge they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be entitled to, and by a grant from JESUS CHRIST. And if CHRIST has grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:011598_0062_0F877A78D73A78E0"/>
them this privilege, for their ſpiritual good, what power on earth can juſtly deprive them of it? If ſuperior Clergymen at home, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ones here, ſhould combine together, and project a plan to prevent their being under the governing authority of Biſhops, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly plan away an indubitable privilege they are entitled to as members of the church of England; and, if they are really Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, they muſt look upon ſuch treatment as highly <hi>injurious</hi> and abuſive. The Doctor, in anſwering this part of the objection, has done no great honour to himſelf. He could ſcarce have ſaid any thing that would have more expoſed the weakneſs of what he undertook to defend.</p>
            <p>THE propoſed plan was ſaid to be 'injurious alſo to the Biſhops it would have ſent to the Colonies.' And for this reaſon, 'Becauſe they are, in a meer arbitrary manner, reſtrained in the exerciſe of that authority, which, in the judgment of theſe very planners, properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, both by apoſtolic appointment, and the conſtitution of the church of England.' The Doctor replies, 'If ſuch a reſtraint is not injurious to the church, it will be difficult to prove that it can be injurious to the Biſhops.'— It is not poſſible it ſhould be any other than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the church, as it deprives its Laity of a privilege they are as certainly entitled to as the Clergy, and that might be as advantagious to them. But he ſays further, 'Are we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the authority of Biſhops as ſo much <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate property,</hi> which belongs to them, and every limitation of it as ſo much <hi>damage</hi> ſuſtained by the Biſhops? And yet, unleſs we conſider it under ſome ſuch idea, I ſee not how it can be made out, that any <hi>prudent</hi> reſtraints of their
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:011598_0062_0F877A78D73A78E0"/>
authority can be an injury to them.' Ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration only could have convinced me, that the Doctor was capable of ſinking ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a man of common underſtanding in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning here. Does he not believe, has he not ſtrenuouſly pleaded, that the governing autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Biſhops is derived from JESUS CHRIST himſelf? And if CHRIST has veſted Biſhops with their governing authority, is no <hi>injury</hi> done to them, arbitrarily to reſtrain them in the exerciſe of this authority? If CHRIST has empowered, and commanded Biſhops to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe authority over the Laity, as well as Clergy, ſhall it be deemed no <hi>injury</hi> to be confined in the exerciſe of this authority to the Clergy only? It is amazing, one of the Doctor's character ſhould not be able to ſee, that Biſhops were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of 'ſuſtaining damage' in other ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of being touched in their 'private property!' If he had allowed himſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, he muſt have known, that a good Biſhop would have eſteemed himſelf more highly <hi>injured</hi> by being reſtrained in the juſt exerciſe of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority committed to him by CHRIST, than by ſuffering in his private property.' A <hi>total</hi> reſtraint of authority over the Laity is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a 'prudent one; but it can be ſo, only in regard of political worldly ends to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. I entirely agree with the Doctor in what he adds, 'He that is fond of exerciſing power for the ſake of exerciſing it, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding whether it tends to edification or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, is unworthy of it.' But what he aims at proving by this is beyond me to find out. Surely he will not ſay Biſhops are ſo fond of the deſtructive power here deſcribed, as to make it expedient to reſtraim them from the exerciſe of
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011598_0063_0F877A7A5B93B910"/>
any power at all over the Laity! And unleſs he means this, I ſee not to what end he has made the remark. And, in every conceivable view of it, it holds as ſtrong againſt their having pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Clergy as over the Laity. This is all he has thought fit to ſay in anſwer to the firſt objection. The reader can have no juſt idea of the utter inſufficiency of this reply, unleſs he compares it with the objection, as ſtated and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated in the 'appeal anſwered.'</p>
            <p>OBJECTION II. 'The Biſhops, in this plan, are ſo widely different from the Biſhops of the church of England at home, that it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable they ſhould be deſired, or ſent.' The Doctor ſays, in anſwer, 'The Biſhops, in this plan, are <hi>eſſentially</hi> the ſame with the Biſhops at home, how widely ſoever they may differ in ſome circumſtances.' Can they be <hi>eſſentially</hi> the ſame, if they are <hi>eſſentially</hi> reſtrained in the exerciſe of that authority which is proper to their office, and they have full ſcope to exerciſe at home? And yet, this is the exact truth. It is expreſsly propoſed, that they ſhall have no rule over the Laity; that is, that they ſhall be deprived of one half of that authority, as to its exerciſe, which is <hi>eſſential</hi> to them as Biſhops. He goes on, 'But let them be never ſo different, if ſuch Biſhops as are propoſed are fitter for the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, than ſuch Biſhops as are in England, then it may be reaſonable that they ſhould be both deſired and ſent.' The plain anſwer is, they are not fitter for the Colonies, than for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Country; and it is unreaſonable they ſhould be deſired for, or ſent to, the Colonies, until they are firſt enjoyed at home. It was ſaid in illuſtrating this objection, 'Shall a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive handful of epiſcopal profeſſors, moſt of whom,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:011598_0063_0F877A7A5B93B910"/>
in many of the Colonies, are ſo inſufficient as that they are upheld in Being, with reſpect to their religious denomination, at the charitable expence of a diſtant Society;—ſhall theſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves ſo important as that, for their ſakes, the powers and appendages of Biſhops ſhall be ſo mightily abridged? Surely the whole body of Diſſenters in England, and a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the eſtabliſhed church there, are as well worthy the national attention; and it is as fit, their requeſts, often repeated, ſhould be anſwered. When this is done it will be time, and not before, to expect that this plan ſhould be conſidered, and brought into effect.— To this, and much more of the like import, the Doctor has only ſaid, That he 'had before giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a full and ſufficient anſwer:' But where, he has not told us; nor can I find that he has any where given ſuch an anſwer, or even attempted to do ſo. He has alſo ſilently paſſed over what was argued from the doctrine of <hi>uniformity,</hi> made ſo important a matter in the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; as that it would mar the glory of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to clothe the ſame officers of the ſame church not with the ſame, but widely differing powers; and that there would not, in this caſe, be the appearance of conſiſtent regularity in one and the ſame eccleſiaſtical conſtitution.—This ſilence of the Doctor, in anſwer to objections he openly 'invited objectors to make, that they might be fairly and candidly debated before the tribunal of the Public,' will, I fear, be conſtrued to his diſadvantage, if not to the hurt of the cauſe he is defending.</p>
            <p>HE goes on to the next conſideration, which is, 'That if Biſhops ſhould be ſent to the Colonies, with theſe reſtrained powers, undeſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:011598_0064_0F877A7B18A2BF58"/>
conſequences might be naturally feared, both <hi>here</hi> and at <hi>home.</hi>'</p>
            <p>AN undeſirable conſequence to be feared <hi>here</hi> is, 'That the Biſhops would throw off this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint as ſoon as might be; embracing all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and uſing all likely means, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe appendages to their office they had been deprived of.' This was ſaid, and ſhewn, to be no unreaſonable ſuppoſition. The Doctor replies, 'Was it ever before offered as a reaſon, why exorbitant power ſhould not be limited, (and ſuch the Doctor eſteems to be the power of Biſhops in England) becauſe the perſons cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed would endeavour to throw off the reſtraint as ſoon as may be?' This queſtion, as thus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally put, is quite beſide the caſe. We never objected to the propoſed limitation of the power of Biſhops, as being in itſelf, in its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, unreaſonable and unfit; but to the confinement of it to the Colonies: and for this good reaſon, among others, that it would ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to defeat itſelf. The Biſhops under a reſtraint of their power <hi>here,</hi> would naturally be diſpoſed to throw it off, if the like reſtraint did not take place at <hi>home</hi>; and they would have this plauſible plea to make in their own juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that they aimed at nothing more than was allowed to be reaſonable and proper in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. The plain truth is, if the exorbitant power of Biſhops ought to be reſtrained at all, it is as reaſonable it ſhould be reſtrained at <hi>home</hi> as <hi>here</hi>; and it is a good reaſon, why it ſhould not be reſtrained there, that ſuch an unfair, partial, and unjuſt reſtraint would, in all probability, through the luſt of power, which even Biſhops are not totally delivered from, ſoon come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here. But ſays the Doctor, 'Why are
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:011598_0064_0F877A7B18A2BF58"/>
we to ſuppoſe, that the American Biſhops will be uneaſy under ſuch a limitation of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as the plan expreſſes?' The reaſon is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, namely, becauſe Biſhops have diſcovered, in all paſt ages, that corruption was ſo far unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in them, as to conſiſt with a ſtrong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to enlarge the ſphere of their power, whenever they had any plauſible pretence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for; as they certainly would have in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe. But 'whatever power or privilege, they [the propoſed Biſhops] ſhall once poſſeſs, by virtue of their office, they will continue to hold, as long as they ſhall remain in the office; and as they know the terms before they accept of it, there can be no diſappointment. And why ſhould they be uneaſy, becauſe the Biſhops at home are inveſted with civil authority? The Biſhops at home may as properly be uneaſy and reſtleſs, becauſe they are not, like ſome of their order on the Continent of Europe, ſovereign Princes.' Some Biſhops at home, in times paſt, whatever may be the truth at this day, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy and reſtleſs for want of more honour and power; and, without all doubt, would have uſed any means, could they probably hoped for ſucceſs in the uſe of them, in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as 'ſovereign Princes' as any 'Biſhops on the Continent of Europe.' And no ſecurity can be given us, if the deſired Biſhops ſhould be ſent, and upon the propoſed plan too, that they would not be ſoon ſo 'reſtleſs and uneaſy,' as to affect that very change, in their reſtrained dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and power, which is ſo much feared. The Doctor goes on, 'Perhaps the uneaſineſs of the American Biſhops may be ſuppoſed to ariſe from the reflection, that, deſtitute as they are of civil power, they are Biſhops of the ſame church with
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:011598_0065_0F877A7E8C5F6390"/>
their brethren in England.' And it may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be ſuppoſed, they would be 'uneaſy,' if not at firſt, yet, in a little time, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that they were deprived of that power, it is as reaſonable they ſhould be veſted with, as their brethren of the ſame church, and in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame office, at home. But 'they will not be able to avoid this further reflection, that they are Biſhops of the ſame church in <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> countries, and under <hi>different</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; which eſſentially alter the caſe.' It is not probable they would ever make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, as there would be no juſt reaſon for their ſo doing. It is, in truth, nothing better than a vain pretence. The ſame epiſcopal-mode of church government is as proper for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Country, as the Colonies. Nothing in the ſituation of America, or in the circumſtances of the Country, or of the Epiſcopalians in it, can make it reaſonable, or fit, that the epiſcopal-mode ſhould be 'different' here from what it OUGHT to be at home, unleſs it be ſuppoſed, that the Kingdom of CHRIST is not that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual one he has declared it to be, but a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom whoſe government is founded on worldly policy, and is to be ſupported upon principles of the ſame kind. What but the wiſdom of this world could ever lead any man to think, that the profeſſed diſciples of the ſame LORD, of the ſame religion, and of the ſame ſubjection to the ſame ſpiritual government, ſhould be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently governed, becauſe they happen to live in different places? No conſiderations, but thoſe of this world, can be mentioned, that will juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, as reaſonable, that epiſcopal mode of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment here, which will not render it equally fit in England. Says the Doctor yet farther,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:011598_0065_0F877A7E8C5F6390"/>
'This ſame kind of reaſoning would operate as ſtrongly againſt epiſcopal <hi>Clergymen</hi> in America, as againſt Biſhops. The Clergy of the church of England at home, are, in a great meaſure, ſupported by tythes; therefore, it may be ſaid, if <hi>Clergymen</hi> of the church of England are once admitted in this Country, under whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions and limitations, they will not be eaſy, until they ſhall have ſecured to themſelves the tythes of our eſtates.' The fact here ſuppoſed is, I believe, ſtrictly true, that the Clergy of the church of England will never be '<hi>eaſy</hi> until they have ſecured to themſelves' from our eſtates here, what will be, in ſubſtantial ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the ſame thing with the tythes in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. The Doctor himſelf very obviouſly, however undeſignedly, led us to ſuſpect this in ſome hints he dropped in his appeal; and that is attempting to be done, or actually is done, at home, reſpecting GLEBE-LANDS for the church of England in America, which puts it beyond all doubt. But this notwithſtanding, we object not againſt the admiſſion of epiſcopal Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or even Biſhops, into America, if they have no authority, but that which is 'altogether from CHRIST,' and not from this world.</p>
            <p>AT <hi>home,</hi> it was ſaid, two ill conſequences might be looked for. One was, 'That vaſt numbers there, who have long complained of the too largely extended power claimed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by Biſhops, might think themſelves hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated, that no regard ſhould be paid to their intreaties, while a comparatively few inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable profeſſors of the church of England in America are heard, and an Epiſcopate ſettled for them according to their mind.' To this the Doctor anſwers, 'The reader can hardly avoid
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:011598_0066_0F877A800DDC2FF0"/>
remarking, that here, and in many other places, the Doctor forgets his proper buſineſs and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. His buſineſs is to anſwer the appeal upon the principles of the Diſſenters; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, he frequently endeavours to raiſe difficulties and objections which cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be made, but upon principles oppoſite to his own, and of thoſe whom he repreſents, in this controverſy.' The Doctor has injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally miſplaced this remark. Had he made it under the former objection, it would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more plauſible. As brought in here, it is really a blunder. Surely, Diſſenters at home might, in their proper character as ſuch, complain of hard treatment, ſhould the requeſt be granted to a few comparatively inconſiderable American Epiſcopalians, which, for a long time has been, and ſtill is, denied them; though the requeſt from them is equally reaſonable. It is ſcarce poſſible but that they ſhould feel, and groan under, ſuch partiality. But, upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever principles this, or any others, difficulty is raiſed, it is proper, if a real one, it ſhould be mentioned by way of objection, as objections of all kinds were called for. And the Doctor is now informed, if he needs information, that thoſe he improperly calls <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in this part of the world, are, upon chriſtian principles, in real earneſt that the epiſcopal LAITY may not be impoſed on by their planning Clergy. The former objection, under which the Doctor's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remark would have been more pertinent, was principally made with a view to ſerve them; as there has been a combination of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to carry into execution, ſo far as they were able, a ſcheme they had contrived for their own ſakes, to the intire neglect of them; though
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:011598_0066_0F877A800DDC2FF0"/>
much more worthy of the moſt ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion they could have made for their ſpritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al profit, under the government of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Biſhops. The Doctor goes on, 'It will never be admitted as an objection <hi>coming from the Diſſenters here,</hi> or in England, that many at home will grow more clamorous againſt the preſent power of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the ſettlement of ſuch an Epiſcopate as is propoſed for the Colonies.' What buſineſs had the Doctor with thoſe he calls <hi>Diſſenters here,</hi> when the objected difficulty was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs the propoſed plan might give the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters at home?</hi> Beſides, he ought to have known, there are no <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in any of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies to the northward of Maryland, unleſs <hi>epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> ones. Moreover, it was not mentioned as an objection, that Diſſenters at home would 'grow more clamorous in conſequence of the ſettlement of the propoſed Epiſcopate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>' This he repreſents as my objection, but without any juſt foundation from what I had ſaid. There is a great and wide difference betwixt Diſſenters being 'clamorous againſt the power of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Biſhops,' upon the ſettlement of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Epiſcopate here, and their 'thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hardly treated, that no regard ſhould be paid to their intreaties, while a few compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively inconſiderable Epiſcopalians, in America, are heard, and an Epiſcopate ſettled for them according to their mind.' Theſe were my words, and they contain a juſt reaſon for ſuch ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as naturally ariſe from hard and partial treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which there may be without being at all 'clamorous.' The Doctor has only this to ſay further here, 'Should the objection be made by any who have a right to make it, it is ſufficient
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:011598_0067_0F877A80AD0CE1F8"/>
to refer them to what has been already ſaid to the purpoſe.'—Surely, if he had a right to 'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite objectors to propoſe their objections, that they might be fairly debated before the tribunal of the Public.' they muſt be ſuppoſed, at leaſt by him, to have this right which he ſeems to queſtion. His buſineſs was to point out the impropriety, or inſufficiency, of ſuch objections as any might make, not to ſuggeſt that they had no right to make them. But what is it he had already ſaid, to which he refers us? It is in theſe words, 'That ſuch an Epiſcopate may be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed HERE with eaſe; but it cannot be effected in ENGLAND, without ſubverting an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and making a very viſible alteration in the national conſtitution—a work never to be undertaken but in the greateſt extremity, and, even then, not without a trembling hand.' We have nothing more here than an affirmation of his own opinion; though he knew it was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others equally capable of judging, that he is certainly and groſsly miſtaken.—The propoſed Epiſcopate could not be erected <hi>here</hi> with that 'eaſe' he would inſinuate. It would, without all doubt, be the occaſion of effects ſimilar to thoſe, it would have, were it to be erected at <hi>home</hi>; and they would probably be, in proportion, as great and general. As to its 'ſubverting an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and making a very viſible alteration in the national conſtitution,' he has himſelf given us a full and ſufficient anſwer. For he has told us, (p. 205) That 'as to ſuch externals [as the plan for an American Epiſcopate would propoſe ſhould be altered] the church of England has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways allowed them to be things that are alterable, and that they ought to be altered, according to the circumſtances and opinions of different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:011598_0067_0F877A80AD0CE1F8"/>
or even of the ſame Country in different ages.' Perhaps, he will allow, if he will not the impartial Public will, that the circumſtances and opinions of the preſent age make it as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fit, as they well can do, that theſe AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERABLE EXTERNALS ſhould be ALTERED. And I will venture to ſay, it is, in the preſent day, extremely neceſſary ſuch an alteration ſhould be undertaken. The ſooner the better. And it might, without much difficulty be accompliſhed, if gone upon, not 'with a trembling hand,' but a reſolution of ſpirit becoming men and Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>THE other ill conſequence, as the Doctor has been pleaſed to repreſent it, is, 'That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in England will be jealous, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of their authority was intended'. I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, nor intended to ſay, that any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of their authority was intended, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they 'might eaſily and naturally argue from what was done here to what might, with as much reaſon, be done there:' Upon which account, it was further ſaid, 'It can be ſcarce ſuppoſed, it ſhould eſcape the thought of our Engliſh Biſhops, that the ſettlement of ſuch an Epiſcopate in America, as is propoſed, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for ſuch a change in the power of Biſhops at home, as they would not be very fond of.' To which the reply is, 'I will only remind the Doctor of one circumſtance which he happened to forget; namely, that this very plan has been formed and introduced by thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops themſelves, and conſequently ſhould they be jealous that any invaſion of their power is therein intended, they muſt be jealous that they have intended to invade it themſelves". I can aſſure the Doctor I did not forget, that a few Biſhops at home might have an hand in the formation of this plan; but
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:011598_0068_0F877A8126B48DD8"/>
that they all, or generally, had, I have never yet ſeen reaſon to believe. But if it was the joint contrivance of them all, it would only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue this, that they were inattentive to what might be the reſult of this plan in the natural courſe of its operation; or that they were above fearing conſequences; or, in fine, that they deſigned this plan as only an entering wedge to make way for the creation of more Biſhops, who, in proper time, might be clothed with like dignity and power with themſelves.</p>
            <p>THE impartial public will judge, whether the Doctor has ſucceeded better in his anſwer to this, than the foregoing objection. I could wiſh, for his own ſake, he had acquitted himſelf more like a man of thorough underſtanding, 'that came prepared' to plead for the truth only, and not 'to object at any rate, rather than not to object at all'</p>
            <p>OBJECTION III. 'THE church of England knows no ſuch Biſhops as are ſpecified in this plan, nor can they, in conſiſtency with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, be ſent to the colonies'. As this is an objection eſſentially deſtructive of the propoſed plan, if it exhibits the real truth, it was juſtly expected the Doctor would have been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly careful to demonſtrate that it did not. And yet, to the ſurpriſe of his readers, the whole he has thought fit to offer is contained in theſe words, 'this objection, and all that has been ſaid to ſupport it, has been fully anſwered already'. What muſt the public ſay of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn call for objections to be fairly debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their tribunal, when, upon this call's being complied with, by mentioning, and ſupporting, an eſſentially important objection, he virtually declines debating on it by dogmatically affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:011598_0068_0F877A8126B48DD8"/>
'that it has been fully anſwered already, and all that has been ſaid to ſupport it? And this is the more extraordinary, as he has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the page, or even the part of his book, in which this full and very particular anſwer is to be found. I have carefully looked over the whole he had 'already' wrote, and cannot find any thing that reſembles the anſwer he deſcribes. What he has offered upon the King's ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, page 49, and three or four pages onwards, looks the moſt this way; and this, I conjecture, is what he refers to: But it is far, very far, from being an anſwer to 'all that was ſaid' in ſupport of the preſent objection. This I ſhall now endeavour to make evident to the reader; and may venture, in the doing of it, to engage his attention for a while, without being charged with keeping out of ſight the grand point in controverſy,</p>
            <p>THE plan ſays, 'The Biſhops to be ſent to America ſhall have no authority, but purely of a ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical nature, ſuch as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, and not from the STATE. The objection againſt this plan is, 'The church of England knows no ſuch Biſhops, nor can they, in conſiſtency with its conſtitution, be ſent to the Colonies.' And why? Becauſe the conſtitutional ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the King is ſuch, that there can be no Biſhops without his licence for their election; nor, when elected, and conſecrated, can they exerciſe any authority, not in purely ſpiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but BY and UNDER him, and within the limits that have been pointed out by the STATE. They may not vary a title in any one thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the exerciſe of their authority. How then can their authority be ALTOGETHER from
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:011598_0069_0F877A81E7B321B8"/>
the CHURCH, not from the STATE? If, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with the conſtitution, they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe no authority, as officers in the church of England, but BY and UNDER the King as SUPREME GOVERNOR. and in exact confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the ORDERS of the STATE, how is it poſſible their authority ſhould be 'ſuch as is ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, not at all from the STATE? This, to ordinary underſtandings, looks very like a direct contradiction. In this way of arguing the objection was largely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <p>LET us now ſee, whether what the Doctor has offered upon the King's ſupremacy is 'a full anſwer to all that has been here ſaid.' He has cited the thirty-ſeventh article of the church of England, which contains her doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the King's ſupremacy; he has cited al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Queen's injunctions to which this article refers: But, it is to be particularly obſerved, in his whole arguing upon this point, he attempts to prove no more than this, that 'the church was believed to have certain powers of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nature, which this ſupremacy does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and which our Princes are ſo far from pretending to convey, that all manner of right to exerciſe them, in their own perſons, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in formally and expreſsly diſclaimed.' That this is what he endeavoured to prove, is made indiſputably clear from the manner in which he illuſtrates his argument. Says he, 'Let it be conſidered, that every man is, in ſome ſenſe, a King in his own houſe and family; and no cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman has a right to come into it to perform any eccleſiaſtical offices, to adminiſter baptiſm for inſtance, without his leave and conſent. Upon him it altogether depends, whether the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:011598_0069_0F877A81E7B321B8"/>
Clergyman ſhall have a proper and <hi>lawful</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to perform this office in his family. But is it not evident, that the giving him that authority is a very different thing, from inveſting him with the general-power to adminiſter the ſacraments? In like manner, as a Kingdom may be conſidered as a large family, the King is the political father of this family; and as ſuch is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme over all perſons belonging to it, whether ſpiritual or temporal. And without his conſent or authority, no Biſhop, or eccleſiaſtical perſon, can lawfully officiate within his dominions. But the giving this authority, by commiſſion, or in any other way, does not convey to any man his ſacred character; but always ſuppoſes him to have been previouſly inveſted with it, by virtue of a commiſſion from CHRIST.' What the Doctor has here ſaid, by way of illuſtration, is highly exceptionable, and ſerves little to any other purpoſe than to make it certain, that all he aims at proving is only this, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's ſupremacy, it is from CHRIST, not the King, that the authority of Biſhops, as ſuch, in the church of England, is conveyed to them. It is, with me, beyond all doubt, that his labor upon this head is altogether in vain. The Queen's words, in her injunctions, as quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Doctor, are theſe, 'Her Majeſty nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, nor ever will, challenge any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, other than that was challenged and lately uſed by the ſaid noble Kings of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, which IS, and was of antient time, <hi>due to the imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi>' What now is the authority that was challenged and uſed by theſe noble Kings? It is nothing ſhort of this; that they were veſted with 'ALL POWER
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:011598_0070_0F877A82AF8E9B38"/>
to exerciſe ALL MANNER of juriſdiction; and that Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Arch-Deacons, and other eccleſiaſtical perſons, have NO MANNER of juriſdiction <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> but BY and UNDER the KING's MAJESTY, who hath full power and authority to hear and determine ALL MANNER of cauſes ECCLESIASTICAL, and to reform and correct all vice, ſin, errors, hereſies, enormities, abuſes whatſoever, which, by ANY MANNER of SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY or juriſdictión, ought or may be lawfully reformed. <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Burn</hi>'s eccleſiaſtical law, under the word, <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> wherein the ſeveral acts of Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to this ſubject, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth are cited.</note> Who that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſuch power is veſted in the King, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head of the church, can, at the ſame time, believe, that the authority of Biſhops, in their eccleſiaſtical character, is ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, not from the STATE? If the Doctor ſhould be able to prove this to be within the compaſs of poſſibility, he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a far higher reach of thought than he has ever yet done But we have no need to enlarge here. Should it be ſuppoſed, not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the authority of Biſhops does not flow from the Crown, but from the church, which is the utmoſt the Doctor has endeavoured to prove, it will not follow from hence, that he has anſwered, or ſo much as attempted to anſwer, 'all that is ſaid in ſupport' of the objection in debate. Dare he ſay, that the authority of the clergy of the church of England, whether ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior or inferior, let him derive it from what ſource he pleaſes, can be conſtitutionally exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any one inſtance, but as pointed out by the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:011598_0070_0F877A82AF8E9B38"/>
King and Parliament? Can the whole Clergy of England, with all the power they are veſted with from CHRIST, make the leaſt alteration in the eſtabliſhed form of worſhip, ordination, or government? Is there any one thing, in theſe moſt important religious points, that they can depart or vary from? If now their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as to ITS EXERCISE, is intirely under the direction, reſtraint, and ſovereign controul of the King and Parliament, how groſsly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd muſt it be to propoſe the miſſion of Biſhops, with ſuch authority only, as is ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, and not at all from the STATE? There are no ſuch Biſhops in the church of England, nor can there be till the King is deprived of that ſupremacy, which has been granted to him by acts of Parliament, and the preſent eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nullified, or eſſentially altered. It will not be in the power of the Doctor fully to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer 'all that has been ſaid', until he hás in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligiby informed us, how that authority is ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, and not from the STATE, which can be exerciſed, neither in the affair of worſhip, ordination, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or diſcipline, but BY and UNDER the guidance, controul, and ſovereignly preſcribed order, not of the CHURCH, but of the STATE: This is his proper buſineſs—This he ſhould have undertaken in his reply to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection—And this is ſtill incumbent on him, if he would entertain the leaſt hope, upon juſt grounds, of ſupporting ſo ſtrange a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal as that of the miſſion of ſuch Biſhops to America, as are unknown to the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and cannot be ſent but upon the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or great alteration, of the preſent eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:011598_0071_0F877A836172E1A8"/>I SHALL only add, the objection in debate was enforced by obſerving, 'That this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the STATE, notwithſtanding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired authority ALTOGETHER from the CHURCH, is the true ſource of all the hardſhips and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, on account of the want of Biſhops in America, that have been ſo bitterly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. Did Biſhops of the church of England no more depend on the STATE, than our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters do, the epiſcopal churches here might as well be ſupplied with Biſhops, as our's are with Paſtors,' &amp;c. To all which the Doctor has no where dropped a word, though he has 'fully anſwered all that was ſaid.' It certainly looks as though he did not know what to ſay, or he would have ſaid that which would have had a better tendency to ſerve his cauſe.</p>
            <p>OBJECTION. IV. 'We are in principle, againſt all civil eſtabliſhments in religion; and as we do not deſire any ſuch eſtabliſhment in ſupport of our own religious ſentiments, or practice, we cannot reaſonably be blamed, if we are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to encourage one in favour of the epiſcopal Coloniſts" The Doctor obſerves upon this, 'If by WE, I mean thoſe of the congregational perſuaſion in New-England in general, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection contains an article of intelligence that is to him NEW.' Nothing more follows from hence, than that he is informed of ſomething he did not know before. But though he would affect to be ignorant of a real truth, he is free to declare his faith in an imaginary one, namely, 'That a large majority of the ſeveral perſuaſions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the people called Quakers, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the declarations that have been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt eſtabliſhments in the groſs, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a reſerve in favour of the eſtabliſhment of
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:011598_0071_0F877A836172E1A8"/>
their <hi>own</hi> religion.' Was it to the purpoſe of the preſent argument, I could eaſily, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding 'the hiſtorical accounts, and authentic anecdotes, in the Doctor's poſſeſſion,' make it appear, with a meridian luſtre, 'That the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, in the reign of Queen <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi>' are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly miſrepreſented in what he has here given us 'from <hi>Maddox</hi>'s anſwer to <hi>Neal.</hi>' And he muſt not take it amiſs, if I tell him, that we are not ſurpriſed at his endeavouring to unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the nakedneſs 'of his anceſtors,' as he is a DESERTER from that GREAT CAUSE which brought them over to this then deſolate land: Nor is it beyond what we expected, to find him, and many of the Society's Miſſionaries, who are either <hi>proſelites</hi> themſelves, or the <hi>ſons</hi> of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites,</hi> fired with extraordinary zeal in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating high-church principles. This has all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long been the way, on this ſide the Atlantic, in which converts to the church, eſpecially clerical ones, have endeavoured to give proof of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their converſion.</p>
            <p>HE now comes to the point in debate, and agrees with me, 'That if I, and thoſe of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, do not deſire an eſtabliſhment in ſupport of our religious ſentiments, we cannot be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably blamed, if we are not diſpoſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage one in favour of the epiſcopal Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.' But ſays he, 'What has the caſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious eſtabliſhments to do with the American Epiſcopate, which has been offered to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic?' He knew, or might have known, that the objection ſuppoſed they had a great deal to do with it; and, inſtead of aſking ſuch a needleſs queſtion, he ſhould have evinced, upon the foot of ſolid argument, that they had no connection with, or relation to, each other. But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:011598_0072_0F877A8433BF5468"/>
himſelf with only going on aſking, 'Does this plan propoſe an eſtabliſhment of the church?' It undoubtedly does. 'Will the execution of it imply, or amount to, any ſuch thing?' Yes; or it can never be carried into execution. 'Will the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of Biſhops, who ſhall have no authority, but purely of a ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical nature, ſuch as is derived altogether from the church, and not from the ſtate; [and ſo on to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the plan;] I ſay, will the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch Biſhops as theſe amount to an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment? Nay, can it have any more aſpect againſt the civil or religious privileges of the Coloniſts, than againſt thoſe of the <hi>Crim Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars'?</hi> Surely the Doctor could not but know, before he aſked theſe queſtions, that it was only aſking, whether we thought there was any weight, or force, in the produced objection. How unaccountable therefore is it, that he could imagine, that he had ſaid any thing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by <hi>barely</hi> putting theſe queſtions! They are really nothing more than ſo many ſtrongly expreſſed affirmations: and will he call this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? He propoſed, that every objection ſhould be fairly debated before the tribunal of the Public; but, inſtead of debating upon this, he roundly and repeatedly affirms, by way of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it has no validity in it. His proper work was, to make it clearly evident, by good reaſoning, that the propoſed plan did not imply an eſtabliſhment, and that it could, without one, be carried into effect; the contrary to which will, without all doubt, be found the truth of fact, if ever this plan takes place. If it ſhould, it muſt be by the conſtitution of a new church of England in the Colonies; but how this can be effected without an eſtabliſhment, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:011598_0072_0F877A8433BF5468"/>
to the true idea of this word, no one, unleſs it be the Doctor, can explain. This is what he ought to have done in anſwer to the preſent objection; and until we are thus favoured, we ſhall take the liberty to think, we are perfectly conſiſtent with ourſelves, while we are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to encourage the planned epiſcopal eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, as we deſire no eſtabliſhment of our own mode of religious government, or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor now gives us a curious ſpecimen of his talent at nice, ſtrict, cloſe reaſoning. I had ſaid, 'It does not appear to us, that CHRIST has entruſted the ſtate with a right to make religious eſtabliſhments. If the ſtate in England has this delegated authority, muſt it not be owned, that the ſtate in China, in Turkey, in Spain, muſt have this authority alſo? What ſhould make the difference in the eye of true reaſon? Hath the ſtate in England been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by Heaven by any peculiar grant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſtate in other Countries? If it has, let the grant be produced. If it has not, all ſtates have, in common, the ſame authority. And as they muſt ſeverally be ſuppoſed to exert this authority in eſtabliſhments conformable to their own ſentiments in religion; what can the conſequence be, but infinite damage to the cauſe of GOD, and true religion? And ſuch in fact has been the conſequence of theſe eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in all ages, and in all places'. Some of theſe bad conſequences were then particularly mentioned. Let us now ſee the Doctor's reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to invalidate what was thus offered againſt the <hi>right</hi> of ſtates to make religious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Says he, 'The ſame argument with which the Doctor endeavours to overthrow it
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:011598_0073_0F877A84DDC640E0"/>
[this right of ſtates] is as forcible againſt the <hi>right of private judgment.</hi> This will evidently appear from the following experiment. If a perſon in England has this right, muſt it not be owned that a perſon in China, in Turkey, in Spain, muſt have it alſo', and ſo on, applying what I had offered againſt the <hi>right of ſtates</hi> to make religious eſtabliſhments, to the <hi>right of private judgment</hi>; as though the argument was equally forcible againſt the latter as the former. But ſurely the Doctor does not believe, that the <hi>right of ſtates</hi> to make religious eſtabliſhments is as clearly and indubitably a grant from GOD, as the <hi>right of private judgment</hi>! And if he does not, what doth his arguing prove? The caſes muſt be parallel, or the reaſoning from the one to the other cannot be concluſive. It is allowed, the bad effects that follow from the exerciſe of <hi>private judgment</hi> are no proof, that men have not univerſally a right to judge for themſelves. And why? Becauſe they have this <hi>right</hi> granted to them by GOD himſelf, and we are as ſure of it as that he has granted them any other right whatever. Is the caſe the ſame with reſpect to the <hi>right of ſtates</hi> to make religious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Is not their pretended <hi>right</hi> founded en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on its ſuppoſed connection with the real intereſt of religion? It is therefore a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt this <hi>right,</hi> though none at all againſt the <hi>right of private judgment,</hi> that, inſtead of being advantageous, it has been infinitely hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the cauſe of GOD, and true virtue. The religion of Jeſus, in particular, has ſuffered more from the exerciſe of this pretended right, than from all other cauſes put together; and it is, with me, paſt all doubt, that it will never be reſtored to its primitive purity, ſimplicity,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:011598_0073_0F877A84DDC640E0"/>
and glory, until religious eſtabliſhments are ſo brought down as to be no more. In ſhort, when the Doctor ſhall make it evident, that the <hi>ſtate-right</hi> we are conſidering ſtands upon the ſame bottom, and is as inconteſtably a grant from GOD, as the <hi>right of private judgment,</hi> we ſhall then allow, that the bad conſequences flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the exerciſe of theſe rights are as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible an argument againſt the one as the other, that is, no argument at all; but, until then we ſhall think this arguing altogether below one, who would be eſteemed a gentleman endowed with a good capacity for reaſoning. I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſay, the Doctor ſeems to have no great ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at anſwering objections, or has been unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably careleſs in the doing of it. Inſtead of recommending to the reader what has been wrote againſt <hi>religious eſtabliſhments,</hi> I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him to conſult his own reaſon, and to pay a regard to the dictates of COMMON SENSE, and he need not then fear being led aſide either by 'Biſhop <hi>Warburton</hi>'s alliance between the church and the ſtate, or Dr. <hi>Stebbing</hi>'s eſſay concerning civil government, or Dr. <hi>Roger</hi>'s vindication of the civil eſtabliſhment, or Biſhop <hi>Ellys</hi> on ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual liberty, or a late elegant eſſay on eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments in religion, in anſwer to the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional.'</p>
            <p>OBJECTION V. 'The church of England in the Colonies, in its comparative low ſtate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an Epiſcopate, upon this plan, or any other, needs rather the charitable aſſiſtance of its friends to ſupport its preſent Miniſters, and others that are ſtill wanted.' The reply be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, 'The Doctor forgets that the church of England, in ſeveral of the Colonies, is not in that comparative low ſtate he ſpeaks of; but is
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:011598_0074_0F877A85AB72CD80"/>
able to ſupport, and does ſupport, its Miniſters in general as amply as any ſet of Clergymen are ſupported in the Britiſh dominions.' This I did not forget, though I took no notice of it, for this very good reaſon, becauſe it did not appear, that the church of England in any of theſe Colonies had complained for want of Biſhops, or were diſpoſed to petition for them. The only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers and petitioners are reſidents in the other Colonies, where the church of England is in the comparatively low ſtate that was repreſented. Neither Clergy, nor Laity in the Colonies where epiſcopal Miniſters are ſo 'amply ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,' have made any ſtir, that we know of, about the want of Biſhops, or ſignified their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of their miſſion. But, ſays the Doctor, 'Suppoſing the church throughout the Colonies needed the charitable aſſiſtance of its friends to ſupport its Miniſters, yet this would be no proof that it does not need alſo an Epiſcopate.' If it would be no proof of this, it would fully prove, that the epiſcopal Clergy, in the Colonies, are boundleſs in their deſires of charity. One would think, the amazing ſum that is annually, and charitably, expended in ſupporting Miſſionaries, might ſatisfy the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lurdieſt beggars, without han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering after as much more charity as would be ſufficient for the ſupport of Biſhops. Beſides, they cannot have Biſhops, upon the propoſed plan, unleſs the church of England is, by the <hi>ſtate,</hi> differently conſtituted here from what it is at home.</p>
            <p>I HAD ſaid, 'In North-Carolina, the religious ſtate of things, by all accounts, is deplorably ſad—They have few, very few, Miniſters to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate in goſpel-adminiſtrations. That charity, which might be ſufficient for the maintenance of
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:011598_0074_0F877A85AB72CD80"/>
as many Miſſionaries as would be needful there, would be ſwallowed up by one Biſhop only. And would this tend ſo much to the honour of GOD, and the good of ſouls, as if it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in ſupport of miſſions that are really ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary?' Upon this the Doctor cries out, 'It is ſurprizing to ſee what advantages are claimed by ſome people! How they can make uſe of the ſame argument to different purpoſes! When other ends are to be anſwered, the writers againſt the church can tell us, that the Society have no power to apply their funds to other uſes than were intended by the donors—But now an Epiſcopate is in view, it is thought reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and juſt that the Society ſhould alienate a fund, more ſtrictly appropriated to a particular uſe than any other in their power, (for this may be truly ſaid of the fund for the ſupport of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Biſhops) and expend it upon Miſſionaries to be ſent to Carolina, and other places, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded always, that ſuch places are at a due diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from New-England.' It is not eaſy to conceive, what could give occaſion for this ſtrange remark. Not a word was ſaid of the fund appropriated for the ſupport of American Biſhops, or of the Society's expending one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this fund to other uſes than were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the donors. It was only ſaid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, 'That charity which might be ſufficient for the maintenance of as many Miſſionaries as were wanted would be ſwallowed up by one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop only.' H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Society nothing put into their hands for the ſupport of the goſpel in America, beſides what is appropriated for the ſupport of Biſhops here? And as the fund for the ſupport of American Biſhops is inſufficient, might not the Society, with fidelity to their truſt,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:011598_0075_0F877A865F2995B8"/>
in the Doctor's opinion, make up this deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhould Biſhops be ſent? This, and this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is what I had in view. And as Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were peculiarly wanted in Carolina, and other places, it was ſuppoſed, and I believe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt grounds, that it would be more for the honour of GOD, it ſhould be expended this way, than in ſupporting Biſhops. What the Doctor has here ſaid is therefore quite aliene from what was really intended, nor in the leaſt an anſwer to it. Had he looked within, I can ſcarce think his conſcience would have ſuffered him to inſinuate, that I ſpake of miſſions to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina, becauſe at 'a due diſtance from New-England.' He knows, that the expreſsly nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed object of the Society's care is, the miſſion of Clergymen for the adminiſtration of the word and ſacraments in thoſe Colonies, where there was no proviſion at all, or a mean one, for the publick worſhip of GOD. And he muſt know likewiſe, unleſs he is ſtrangely ignorant, that Carolina is the Colony, if there is any one on the American Continent, where, as we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been told in the ſociety-ſermons, they had ſcarcely any form of public worſhip; where even the LORD's day was hardly diſtinguiſhed from other days, but by greater idleneſs and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and where baptiſm and the LORD's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per were ſcarcely known to be adminiſtred. Why then would he ſuggeſt, that I mentioned Carolina, becauſe 'duly diſtant from New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?' He has not herei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> diſcovered that chriſtian concern for the propagation of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, according to the acknowledged deſign of the Society's charter, which might have been expected from a Miſſionary in virtue of it. He adds, 'As the Society have never acted the part
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:011598_0075_0F877A865F2995B8"/>
of unfaithful ſtewards, in other caſes, we can be under no apprehenſions that they will in this.' I ſay not, that they have acted an unfaithful part; but this I will ſay, it is the real truth of fact, to whatever cauſe it may be owing, that they have employed few Miſſionaries, next to none, in Carolina, where they were moſt needed, and multiplied them where there was little, if any need at all of them; and in ſome places they have ſupported, and are ſtill ſupporting them, where the churches to whom they miniſter are abundantly able, without any aſſiſtance from them, to ſupport the goſpel. And though guarding the Coloniſts againſt, or delivering them from, the deluſions and ſuperſtitions of POPERY, is one eſſential part of the buſineſs of the Society, as pointed out in their charter, they have ſo ſtrangely neglected Canada, which, ever ſince the concluſion of the laſt war, has been a Province in ſubjection to the Britiſh Crown, as to give occaſion for a letter to them, from the Chaplain to the garriſon at Montreal, wherein he ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Abſtract of the proceedings of the Society, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſociety-ſermon preached Feb. 17, 1769, by the Biſhop of Briſtol.</note> 'That the Romiſh Prieſts avail themſelves greatly of the neglected ſtate of the church of England in thoſe parts; perſuading the Canadians, that we have not religion ſo much at heart as they.' Let the impartial Public judge, whether it would not be a much ſtronger argument of the Society's faithfulneſs as ſtewards, to take effectual care that Carolina and Canada have a full ſupply of Miſſionaries, rather than New-England, New-York, the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, or Pennſylvania, where there is no pretence
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:011598_0076_0F877A872AB6D080"/>
of any want of them, but meerly to uphold a different mode of adminiſtration in one and the ſame religion.</p>
            <p>I HAD ſaid, 'As to the Colonies, extending from Pennſylvania to the northermoſt bounds of the Maſſachuſetts-Province, notwithſtanding the pious care of the Society at home, and the vaſt charity they have been annually expending in favour of the church of England, from their firſt incorporation to this day, it has grown but little in compariſon with the other denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of chriſtians, not having got as yet beyond its infant ſtate.' Says the Doctor in reply, 'I conceive he muſt be miſtaken as to the fact. In Pennſylvania, New-Jerſey, and New-York, I will not be poſitive that the church has encreaſed beyond the proportion of other denominations for fifty years paſt—But in the New-England Colonies it appears, from good accounts, that the church has conſiderably increaſed; and that the number of its profeſſors at this day bears a greater proportion to the number of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, than it ever has done before. I may be miſtaken with regard to ſome of the New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland Colonies: But'—. He has hitherto ſpoken cautiouſly, but not like one who appears to have a ſufficient acquaintance with the real truth of fact. Upon the ſtricteſt examination, it would be found, that the increaſe of other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, beyond the increaſe of Epiſcopalians, is greater in New-England, than in New-York, New-Jerſey, or Pennſylvania; and this greater increaſe is rapidly going on in all the Colonies that conſtitute what is called New-England, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Colony of Connecticut, in which there has been the greateſt increaſe of the church of England; but there is nothing 'amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,'
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:011598_0076_0F877A872AB6D080"/>
as the Doctor's epithet is, in this increaſe: Nor had he the leaſt reaſon to go on ſaying, 'I cannot at preſent recollect an example, in any age or country, wherein ſo great a proportion of proſelites has been made to any religion in ſo ſhort a time, as has been made to the church of England in the weſtern diviſion of that populous Colony; unleſs where the power of miracles, or the arm of the Magiſtrate, was exerted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that effect.' Notwithſtanding the hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical mode in which the Doctor here flouriſhes, there are not one tenth part ſo many Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, even in the weſtern diviſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, as there have been ſterling pounds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in order to proſelite them: Nor are there more epiſcopal churches in all the New-England Colonies, than there have been thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of pounds ſterling ſpent to found and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them. And they are, by far the greater part of them, not excepting thoſe in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned 'weſtern diviſion,' in ſo weak and low a ſtate, that there would be no hope of their continued exiſtence, if that charity was withdrawn, which, at firſt, gave being to them, and has all along ſupported them in being: Whereas, the churches of other denominations, without the help of charity from abroad, or the expectation or deſire of any, are become numerous, and continually increaſe in number, beyond what has been known in any age, or place, ſince the firſt ages of chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>I HAD ſpoken of the church of England here, 'as being in its infancy, not able to ſtand upon its own legs, and ſo far from a ſtate of matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as not to make it worth while for a Biſhop to come here.' The Doctor replies, 'infant and feeble as ſhe is, he has allowed that ſhe may

be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>70,000 ſtrong in the Colonies—Now can he poſſibly think, when he allows himſelf time for conſideration, that the church of England in America, containing 270,000 members, in which are included moſt of the governors and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal perſons in the Colonies, is ſo inconſiderable, that it is not worth while for a Biſhop to take the charge of it?' When I ſuppoſed the church of England might contain 270,000, I took into the computation all the Epiſcopalians on the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Continent. But when I ſpake of her as in 'an infant feeble ſtate, not able to ſtand upon her own legs,' my view was (as may be ſeen in the paſſages with which theſe words are connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to her exiſtence in the ſeven Colonies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from Pennſylvania to the utmoſt north-eaſt bounderies of the Maſſachuſetts-Province; in all which, though they contain by far the greateſt number of inhabitants on this Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, there are not more than 26 or 27 thouſand profeſſors of the church of England, who are ſcattered over an extent of 600 miles in length, and more than an 100 in breadth. And 'of theſe, (as was obſerved in my anſwer, pag. 156, to which the Doctor has made no reply) it would be no wrong to the truth, if it ſhould be ſaid, a very conſiderable part went over to the church, not ſo much upon ſober inquiry and real princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as from diſguſt at the pariſh-miniſter, or unhappy prejudices ariſing from the placing a meeting-houſe, or ſome ſuch important difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the towns where they lived.' In this view of the church of England, which is certainly a juſt one, what occaſion is there for Biſhops, at leaſt in theſe parts of America? I had nothing to do with the Colonies to the ſouthward of Pennſylvania. They have neither complained for
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:011598_0077_0F877A87D96B4748"/>
want of Biſhops, or deſired the miſſion of them. When this is the caſe, we ſhall doubtleſs ſay that upon the matter, which is juſt and reaſonable. The above deſcribed ſeven Colonies only, contain the complainers and petitioners; and as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's chief ſolicitude, as well as charity, has been laid out to epiſcopiſe theſe Colonies, they are eminently,if not ſolely, the Colonies for which Biſhops have been ſo earneſtly ſought after. But the church of England muſt make a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable figure in theſe Colonies, before ſhe may hope for ſuch a ſuperior order of men as Biſhops. Will it become their dignity to be ſupported by charity, and to be placed at the head of churches ſo dependant on charity, as that if it is withheld, they muſt, by far the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of them, fall into non-exiſtence? The church (as the Doctor loves to call it—as though there was no other church) muſt wait until it arrives at a ſtate of much greater maturity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be worth while for Biſhops to come here. It is acknowledged the Governor, in moſt of theſe Colonies, is commonly in name, an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian; though ſometimes deſtitute of every thing elſe that looks like religion.—Surely ſuch Governors cannot be ſuppoſed to have much at heart the affair of an Epiſcopate, unleſs they ſhould view it as connected with their worldly intereſt in one ſhape or another. It is quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the truth to ſay, that 'moſt of the principal perſons in the Colonies' are of this perſuaſion, unleſs by principal perſons are meant, thoſe who are appointed to their civil poſts from home. In general there are 50 prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal perſons to one, in the Non-epiſcopal Colonies, who are not members of the church of England, but of churches of other denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="unknown:011598_0078_0F877A895CF4C010"/>THE Doctor now leaves me for a while, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to conſider the objections I had introduced as offered by Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> againſt this plan, in reply to a ſuppoſed high dignitary of the church of England. As it was the profeſſed deſign of the 'appeal' to remove objections againſt the American Epiſcopate, 'the ſuffering theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to lie againſt it, without liſping a word to take off the force of them, 'was mentioned as a failure. The Doctor has excuſed himſelf by ſaying, 'He had not ſeen theſe objections, though he had in vain made inquiry after them.' The excuſe is 'candidly accepted' as a good one. 'But (ſays he) what excuſe can Doctor <hi>Chauncy</hi> make for taking no notice of what was powerfully offered by Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> in anſwer to theſe very objections of Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>?' There is no need of making any excuſe, as, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the invitation given in the 'appeal,' my buſineſs was, not to anſwer objections, but to bring them that they might be anſwered by the Doctor. Now he has adopted what he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines was 'powerfully offered by Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi>' it is become proper I ſhould take notice of it; but, had I done this before, I might have been taxed with officiouſneſs; I ſhould certainly have acted out of character as an objector, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented myſelf in that which ought not to have been expected until now.</p>
            <p>BEFORE the Doctor brings in Mr. <hi>Apthorp,</hi> he ſays a few words, which, I ſuppoſe, he intended ſhould be looked upon as an anſwer to the 'ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient I ſuggeſted to compromiſe matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Epiſcopalians and other denominations in the Colonies;' but as he has ſilently paſſed over what I had largely offered in illuſtration of the propriety and reaſonableneſs of this expedient, I
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:011598_0078_0F877A895CF4C010"/>
have nothing to do here but to deſire the reader to turn to p. 150, 169, 160 of the anſwer to the 'appeal;' and he muſt then be convinced, that the Doctor, under the pretence of ſaying ſomething, has really ſaid nothing.</p>
            <p>NOW comes in Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>'s anſwer to Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>'s objections. This anſwer was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Doctor's death, and the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he made no reply to it was, that neither he, or his friends, thought it worthy of ſuch notice. It was, as they imagined, wrote principally with a view to recommend himſelf to a certain great man, whoſe favour might be advantagious to him. However, if he had been permitted, in the alwiſe government of Heaven, to have lived until this time, he would, doubtleſs, upon this occaſion, have pointed out the utter inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this Gentleman's anſwer to his objections. And though he might have done it to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than I can, divine Providence has put a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bar in the way of the Public's having this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. The reader, while he remembers it is the Doctor's friend that appears in his behalf, will not attribute to him any defect he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the vindication of his objections.</p>
            <p>'THE Doctor, (ſays Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi>) affects to doubt whether the ſcheme propoſed by his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer be not meerly his own, inſtead of being, as is aſſerted, the real and only one that has been in view; and ſays, that if this aſſertion be true, he and others have been miſinformed.' The reply is, 'Let his or their informers ſay on what grounds they have ever affirmed a different one to have been framed; or elſe let them take ſhame to themſelves for inventing falſhoods, or venting imaginations for facts; and let the Doctor ſet a mark on them, and be more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:011598_0079_0F877A8A1AF10C88"/>
whom he believes hereafter.' What was ſaid by the Doctor is here ſet in a very partial and unfair light. Inſtead of properly quoting his words, as he uſed them in a connected courſe of reaſoning, this writer has given them, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſenſe in which he underſtood them, in a diſjoined abſolute form. The writer the Doctor replies to, after he had propoſed a ſcheme for a Colony-Epiſcopate, aſſures us, 'This is the real and only ſcheme that hath been planned for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in America; and whoever hath heard of any other hath been miſinformed through miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take or deſign.' Says the Doctor in anſwer, 'To ſpeak for myſelf, then, I am one of thoſe who have been thus <hi>miſinformed</hi>; and I know of others who have been ſo, in common with me —He ſpeaks of this ſcheme with great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, as if he were at <hi>head-quarters,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew it to be the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>only</hi> one. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, this may be the caſe. But he is not known; nor has he informed us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on what ground or authority he goes in giving this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter. The declaration of an anonymous writer, how confidently ſoever he may expreſs himſelf, is not, ſurely, ſufficient to ſatisfy us, that this is the true ſcheme planned.— It may poſſibly be only his own ſcheme, the ſcheme of a private man; and until it comes with better authority, or in a more authentic way, we may conſider it as an imaginary one.'— Let Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> 'take ſhame to himſelf' for pretending to anſwer an objection, without ſo much as ſaying a word to invalidate ſuch perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſolid reaſoning in ſupport of it. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> himſelf will think, that what is here ſaid is 'powerfully offered;' if he ſhould, without all doubt, the impartial Public will judge otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="unknown:011598_0079_0F877A8A1AF10C88"/>HE goes on to tell us of 'ſucceſſive propoſals for American Biſhops, made at different times, through a long courſe of years, by men of high rank and character in the church; all which agree with what the anſwerer has avered.' He likewiſe gives us at large 'Biſhop <hi>Butler</hi>'s ſcheme, as one 'that might have peculiar weight with the Doctor;' and ſpeaks of it as exactly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to that in the anſwer to his obſervations.' What is all this to the purpoſe? We know, and the Doctor knew, there has long been a deſign to introduce Biſhops into the Colonies, and that plans have been formed to accompliſh this deſign. But ſhould there have been a general agreement in theſe plans, they may be nothing more than the ſchemes of <hi>private men</hi>; and this indeed is the truth of fact. They are not to be looked on as ſchemes ſet forth upon the foot of <hi>proper autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> The planners of them had no ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and whatever they might intend, or pretend, if ever an Epiſcopate is authoritatively ſettled in America, it may be, for aught any or all of them can ſay, upon a plan very different from that which they have propoſed. Mr. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> is pleaſed to ſay of the propoſed plan, 'That it is ſuch a ſimple and beautiful plan of the moſt antient and moderate Epiſcopacy, that it ſhould, not only remove all the Doctor's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, but the ſcruples of every rational and learned Diſſenter againſt that apoſtolic form of government.' Where does this writer find, in any of apoſtolic epiſtles, the model of an epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate without any authority to govern the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity? Let him, if he can, produce a text, in any part of the new-teſtament, wherein <hi>ruling the Clergy, in diſtinction from the Laity,</hi> is made the proper work of Biſhops. He would likewiſe do
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:011598_0080_0F877A8AEACEADE0"/>
what was never done before, if he would point out that part of the chriſtian word, where the Biſhop's dioceſs, in the 'moſt ancient times,' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an hundred miles in breadth, and ſeveral hundred in length. Until he it able to prove, that ſuch was 'the moſt antient Epiſcopacy,' no rational or learned Diſſenter againſt the propoſed plan, will entertain an opinion of it as, in any meaſure, agreeing with the 'apoſtolic form of government.' This Gentleman has not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered here the moſt intimate acquaintance, with either the apoſtolic Epiſcopacy, or that which took place in the moſt antient times.</p>
            <p>HE goes on, 'Suppoſing this to be the real ſcheme, the Doctor owns that it ſets the matter in a leſs exceptionable point of view, than he had ſeen it in before.' Very true; and I am ready to own the ſame thing. But this does not make the ſcheme unexceptionable. He now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, 'The Doctor cannot forbear going fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years back to ridicule ſome harmleſs, though ill choſen, phraſes, in which the ſubſtance of it [the ſcheme] is expreſſed.' As he had occaſion to ſpeak of the Society's abſtract, printed in 1715, in which, among other reaſons for an Epiſcopate in the Colonies, 'the bleſſing all manner of people ſuſceptible of ſuch holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as are made by the impoſition of the Biſhops hands,' is particularly mentioned; it will, I believe, be thought excuſable in him, if he has called this a matter 'ſublime, myſterious and ſacred,' paſſing it over with nothing more than a contemptuous ſneer. But, ſays this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 'He well knows, or eaſily may, that we aſcribe no more efficacy to the laying on of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops hands, then his brethren do to the laying on of Preſbyter's hands.' The Doctor could not
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:011598_0080_0F877A8AEACEADE0"/>
poſſibly know this, becauſe it is not the truth of fact. Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> muſt be very ignorant of the ſentiments of Non-epiſcopalians, if he does not know, that we conceive quite differently of the laying on of Preſbyters hands, from what many, at leaſt, of the church of England do of the laying on of Biſhops hands. Do Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians never ſpeak of an <hi>indelible character</hi> as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Biſhop's hand in ordination? Do they never lead people to think, as if there was an inſtituted connection between the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his hand in confirmation, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment of the Spirit in his gracious influences? Theſe are the falſe and ridiculous notions they deride, not ordination or confirmation, meerly as ſuch, by the laying on of Biſhops hands. And, perhaps, ridicule is the fitteſt way in which ſuch myſteriouſly ſacred matters can be treated. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> or any of his brethren, object to the performance of the offices of ordination or confirmation by perſons of that order, to which Epiſcopalians conceive they are committed.' But, ſays this writer, 'The Doctor thinks we are poſſeſſed ſufficiently of the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our religion, becauſe our young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be confirmed, and Clergymen ordained for us, and properly inſpected afterwards; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they will all go from America to Europe for theſe purpoſes. Can he ſay with a good conſcience, that liberty like this is all he ſhould deſire for himſelf, and his brethren?' And here he is intreated 'to read over ſome words of his anſwerer, to which he has made no reply'. The words are theſe; 'The American Diſſenters from our communion, would think it inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably grievous to have no miniſters, but ſuch as received ordination in England or Ireland; or
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:011598_0081_0F877A8C225B3250"/>
to be witheld from the uſe of any religious rite, which they eſteemed as highly as we do confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; or to have their church deſtitute of a ſuper-intendency, which they conceived to be of apoſtolical inſtitution. I ſhould in ſuch a caſe be a zealous advocate for them, as not yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the full toleration to which they had a right. And ſurely they ought to aſk their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences very ſeriouſly, why they oppoſe our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for ſuch indulgence, as they would claim for themſelves; and whether indeed ſuch oppoſition is not downright perſecution; and that in a matter meerly ſpiritual, without the mixture of any temporal concern'. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Doctor made no reply to theſe words was, not becauſe 'they admit of none,' but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are quite beſide the caſe in diſpute. The American Non-epiſcopalians neither enjoy or deſire to enjoy, any other liberty than to provide ſuch Paſtors, to officiate in ſuch ſervices among them, as they think are agreable to the word of GOD. Such liberty is equally poſſeſſed by Epiſcopalians. If the other denominations more fully and conveniently enjoy the exerciſe of their religion, it is not in the leaſt meaſure owing to their being favoured with greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but to their greater care of themſelves under <hi>that permiſſion,</hi> which is <hi>equally granted</hi> to all denominations. If there is any one <hi>purely ſpiritual</hi> privilege, which Epiſcopalians do not as fully enjoy as any of the other denominations, it is owing to themſelves, and not to any want of liberty in this reſpect. Their liberty is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame with the liberty of the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions. Was it not, I ſhould be as 'zealous an advocate for them,' as this Gentleman could be for us under like circumſtances; as thinking
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:011598_0081_0F877A8C225B3250"/>
that they were hardly uſed. The true reaſon why Epiſcopalians do not AS FULLY enjoy the exerciſe of their religion, as the other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is, not becauſe they are not poſſeſſed of equal liberty, but becauſe they do not make the like full uſe of it. Theſe other denominations would continue until dooms-day without Paſtors to officiate in any religious ſervice among them, if they waited for their miſſion from the <hi>ſtate</hi> at home: Nor would they complain of this as a burden, much leſs an inſupportable one. They are intirely ſatisfied, as they have the grant of liberty to provide for themſelves the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the ſpiritual privileges of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of CHRIST. Epiſcopalians are equally partakers in the ſame granted liberty; and they ſhould be contented herewith, and not complain of it as an inſuperable hardſhip, that the <hi>ſtate at home</hi> does not furniſh them with Biſhops in order to the compleat exerciſe of their religion. Did chriſtian churches in the firſt ages of the goſpel, make ſuch complaints? If they might be permitted to provide ſpiritual officers for the ſpiritual ſervices of chriſtianity, it was all they deſired; and it is all that can reaſonably be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired at this day. And ſuch permiſſion is as compleatly enjoyed by Epiſcopalians, as by any of the other denominations on the Continent.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> proceeds, 'The Doctor, ſtill flying to ridicule in defect of argument, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, how much the Epiſcopalians in America need to be <hi>well ruled</hi> and <hi>governed</hi>—how much the Clergy need to be <hi>united,</hi> and reduced to <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'. The Doctor did not undertake to argue upon theſe things, as is here ſuggeſted. He purpoſely avoided it, leſt he ſhould not 'expreſs himſelf with quite ſo much gravity and ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty'
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:011598_0082_0F877A8C8052AC10"/>
as ſome might think proper. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eaſy to account for this remark upon what the Doctor mentioned in tranſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> only, unleſs it was that occaſion might be here from taken to tell us, 'that the American Clergy are unanimous in their wiſhes to be under the immediate inſpection of Biſhops reſident among them; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence implies quite the contrary to a preſent diſorderly ſtate of that Clergy'. That thoſe among the Clergy, who petitioned for Biſhops are 'unanimous" at leaſt in pretence, in their wiſhes to have them, is not diſputed; but that the whole American Clergy are thus unanimous is far from being a 'known' fact. No evidence has yet been given, that the Clergy, any more than the Laity, in thoſe Colonies which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Epiſcopal, are at all deſirous of being under the 'immediate inſpection of Biſhops'; nor is it thought to be a fact capable of being evidenced. How far this may imply 'a preſent diſorderly ſtate of that Clergy', I leave with this writer to ſay. He adds, with reference to the American epiſcopal Clergy in common, 'they are, perhaps, as faithful to their truſt, and as blameleſs in their manners, as any body of men in the chriſtian miniſtry'. It would give me real and great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, was I as fully ſatisfied of this, as this w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HE now brings in the Doctor ſaying, 'great inconveniences are likely to follow from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Biſhops to America'; and then anſwers, 'He ſays alſo, it is readily owned that our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of what may poſſibly or probably be the conſequences of it, ought not to put us on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing the religious liberty of our fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and chriſtian brethren. Nay, he adds, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we any power to do ſo, if we were
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:011598_0082_0F877A8C8052AC10"/>
               <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and <hi>wicked enough to deſire it</hi>; our charter granting ſuch liberty to <hi>all proteſtants</hi>'. What now is the conſequence of theſe conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? 'Therefore, ſays this writer, Biſhops may, by that charter, ſettle even in New-England'. So purely ſpiritual Biſhops might without it, or in any part of the chriſtian world, in virtue of that liberty wherewith CHRIST has made the profeſſors of his religion free. It follows, 'And if the having Biſhops among them be part of the religious liberty of the Epiſcopalians, as it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently is; the Diſſenters ought not to oppoſe it on account of apprehended conſequenes'. There is a great and wide difference (as has been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved) between purely ſpiritual Biſhops, and ſuch Biſhops as are ſpecified in the propoſed plan. We make no oppoſition to Biſhops that have 'authority altogether from CHRIST, and not the ſtate'. If we oppoſe Biſhops of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpecies, we oppoſe no part of that epiſcopal liberty which is RELIGIOUS; and ſhould great inconveniences be likely to follow from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch Biſhops, oppoſition to their miſſion would, on this account, be highly reaſonable, and not the leaſt infringement on RELIGIOUS liberty.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſays this writer, 'What are the bad conſequences apprehended?' He anſwers, 'Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, the Doctor tells us, are ambitious and unquiet'. In reply whereto he ſays, 'So are Preſbyters, and all ſorts of men too often.' But this proves nothing, unleſs he could have ſaid further, that their ſphere of influence was equally extenſive, in conſequence of which there was equal danger, from their intrieguing with great men at home, or with Governors and principal men here, of carrying into execution ſuch ſchemes as might be greatly hurtful, both in a civil and
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:011598_0083_0F877A8E0A4E5610"/>
religious ſenſe. It follows, 'The Doctor will own that Biſhops are now, and long have been as quiet an order of men as any in the nation.' He will be far from owning this, 'if it be true, as many affirm [theſe are the Doctor's words, p. 64] that <hi>high church tory-principles</hi> are lately <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived</hi> in England, and greatly favoured by ſome, whoſe influence may go far towards bringing them into as much reputation, as they have been in diſgrace ſince the death of Queen <hi>Ann.</hi>'</p>
            <p>THE Doctor had ſaid, 'Let us ſuppoſe, that Biſhops are to be <hi>at firſt</hi> ſent to America with ſuch limited powers [as are mentioned in the propoſed plan,] to reſide in the epiſcopal Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and to have no concern, but with Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians. Have we ſufficient ground to think, that they and their ſucceſſors would, to the day of doom, or for a long time, remain contented with ſuch powers, or under ſuch limitations? In a word, that they would continue ſuch inoffenſive harmleſs creatures as this Gentleman ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.'—To this the reply is, 'Who knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the New-Englandlers will not hang Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Witches again?' It is conceded, no one knows that they will not, ſhould the propoſed miſſion of Biſhops take place; for, in England, where there is no complaint for want of Biſhops, both Quakers and Witches have been hanged in much greater numbers than they ever were here. This writer goes on 'The Clergy of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland are in general friends to religious free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: The people of England, Whigs and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are unfavourable to clerical power; and a far greater danger, than the Doctor's imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary one, is that of their laying aſide all regard to the chriſtian miniſtry, and to chriſtianity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.' The Doctor himſelf, in anſwering a like reply of his Antagoniſt, fully anſwered what is
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:011598_0083_0F877A8E0A4E5610"/>
here ſaid; though this writer, inſtead of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it as he ought, has only repeated, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the ſame thing over again. I have nothing therefore to do here, but to quote the Doctor's own words. Says he, 'All this being t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n for granted, yet may not times alter, and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions change? Who knows what the next reign and adminiſtration may be? or whether attempts towards an oppreſſive enlargement of power, may not be as much encouraged, ae it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they would be frowned on, during the preſent?' Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> ſays further, 'There never was ſo little proſpect, that a ſpirit of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious intolerance would revive here,' that is, in England. I heartily wiſh there was no reaſon to ſuſpect the truth of what is here affirmed. He goes on, 'If it ſhould, it might not extend to New-England—But even ſuppoſing it to reach thither, the effects would be very little by the circumſtance of no Biſhop being already placed in America.'—The Doctor ſhall ſpeak for himſelf here alſo. Says he, 'We are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly much more ſecure againſt ſuch oppreſſion in the abſence of Biſhops, than we ſhould be if they were once fixed here. <hi>Obſta principiis</hi> was never thought an ill maxim by wiſe men,' and ſo on, with pertinency, the beſt part of a page; all which, this writer has been ſo wiſe as to paſs over in ſilence. But, ſays he, 'The whole appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion [of bad conſequences] is groundleſs'. And why? 'The Engliſh Diſſenters, who have ſix and twenty Biſhops eſtabliſhed among them fear no harm from them. Why then ſhould the New-England Diſſenters fear any, if one or two ſhould be eſtabliſhed, with much leſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in one or two neighbouring Provinces?' It is more than this writer knows, that the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:011598_0084_0F877A8E96D07440"/>
at home 'fear no harm:' or ſhould this be true, it is far from being ſo that they ſuffer none. They now are, and ever will be, in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering circumſtances; unleſs the eſtabliſhment of the church of England is diſſolved, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altered from what it is at preſent. And there is nothing felt or feared by Diſſenters at home, but we, in this part of the world, may feel, or have reaſon to fear, ſhould the deſired Biſhops be ſent to the Colonies. The paragraph we have been conſidering is thus concluded, 'So public a declaration as has been made of the model of Epiſcopacy, propoſed to be followed in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, will itſelf be an effectual barrier againſt any undue extenſion of eccleſiaſtical power; of which the Doctor affects to be ſo apprehenſive,' This being a meer naked, unſupported affirmation, nothing more is needful to be ſaid upon it, than only to affirm the direct contrary, that it will not be an effectual barrier, and that the Doctor did not affect to be apprehenſive, but really was ſo, and upon juſt grounds.</p>
            <p>THE Doctor obſerved, 'If Biſhops are ſent to America, they muſt be well ſupported; this is beyond doubt. By whom? or by what means?' And here he largely argued to ſhow it to be highly probable, 'that it would be, if not at firſt, yet in time, by a tax laid on the Colonies to this end.' Among other things, he pertinently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, 'If Biſhops were ſpeedily to be ſent to America, it ſeems not wholly improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from what we hear of the unuſual tenor of ſome late parliamentary acts and bills, for raiſing money on the poor Colonies <hi>without their conſent,</hi> that proviſion might be made for the ſupport of theſe Biſhops, if not of all the church-clergy alſo, in the ſame way.' To
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:011598_0084_0F877A8E96D07440"/>
all which Mr. <hi>Apthorp</hi> is pleaſed to give us the following weighty anſwer, 'If no proper maintenance can be found for them, he needs not be uneaſy at the project of ſending them; and that it is not to be at the expence of the Colonies, he has ſeen in Biſhop <hi>Butler</hi>'s ſcheme, with which the others agree' It is not poſſible any one ſhould have a conception of the pertinency, force, and elegance of the Doctor's objection, as ſet forth at large in his reaſoning upon it, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this curſory, ſlighty, and, I may ſay, trifling anſwer to it.</p>
            <p>AMONG the inconveniences that might reſult from the appointment of Biſhops in America, the Doctor mentioned theſe, 'That, by the increaſe of the epiſcopal party [which might be effected by this appointment, and is doubtleſs one principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it is ſo much deſired] they might get a majority in our houſes of aſſembly; that, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thereof, the church of England might become the eſtabliſhed religion of all theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; that a ſacramental teſt, or ſomething like it, might enſue, to exclude Non-conformiſts from places, preferment, and civil offices, <hi>as in England</hi>; and that taxes might be impoſed on us all in common, for the maintenance of theſe Biſhops, and the epiſcopal Clergy'.—Upon theſe inconveniences the Doctor argued largely, cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and cogently. What now ſays Mr. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp?</hi> In taking notice of this objection, he does as he had all along done before, that is, contents himſelf with nibling at here and there a ſentence which he is pleaſed to pick out, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concerning himſelf with the Doctor's whole reaſoning in connection. Let us take a view of his reply. Says he, 'The Doctor imagines, that appointing Biſhops in America would probably
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:011598_0085_0F877A90766C8A78"/>
increaſe the epiſcopal party there; and then great evils might follow.' What a poor, lame, lank repreſentation is this of what the Doctor had offered! However, let us attend to what follows. 'I cannot diſcern in what other way it can increaſe their party, than by ſupplying them more eaſily with a competent number of miniſters; taking care that theſe miniſters ſhould be diligent and exemplary; and promoting an early ſenſe of piety among their young people, Theſe are no evils.'—The Doctor never liſped a word in complaint of them as ſuch. But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this writer's knowledge of mankind is very ſcanty, if he is capable of 'diſcerning' no other ways, than thoſe he has ſpecified, in which the epiſcopal party might be increaſed. Would the glare of epiſcopal dignity have no influence upon ſome ſort of perſons? Would the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of American Biſhops with thoſe at home, and their power with great men there, have no effect upon the ſons of this world, who might have in view this or the other poſt of honor or profit? A variety of other ways might eaſily be mentioned, wherein the epiſcopal party might be increaſed—But I forbear. He goes on, 'The Doctor indeed ſays, that pretexts might eaſily be found for enlarging the power of theſe Biſhops, and increaſing the number.' The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply is, 'But enlarging their power would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately raiſe a clamour that could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.' Is not this as good a reaſon, at leaſt a very good one, why they ſhould not be ſent at all, unleſs with ſuch powers as are 'altogether from CHRIST, not from the ſtate?' Should they be ſent, would it not raiſe a clamour? And if it could be withſtood, it would not, perhaps, be with ſo much eaſe as ſome may be ready to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:011598_0085_0F877A90766C8A78"/>
But 'if a few Biſhops proved diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more would not be added.' This is more than this Gentleman knows, or has any authority to affirm. Nay, 'though they ſhould prove agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uſeful, more would be ſent only to ſuch Provinces as choſe them.' Perhaps, by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces are meant the comparatively few Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians that live in them; and by their choice of Biſhops, their being contented with having them ſent to them: In this ſenſe, it may be true, 'more Biſhops would be ſent only to ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces as choſe them'; but, in the common and ordinary ſenſe in which theſe words are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, it is not true, that even the firſt propoſed Biſhops would be ſent, or choſen, by any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince on the Continent. It follows, 'In the ſhort ſtay which one of them would chooſe to make in New-England, he would not bring over many perſons to our church. And therefore how terrible things ſoever Epiſcopalians, if they ſhould become the majority, may attempt and perform there, they will be almoſt, if not quite as likely to accompliſh, without a Biſhop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as with ſeeing one now and then.' If Biſhops were ſent, though New-England ſhould not be, at firſt, the place of their reſidence, it would be the <hi>dioceſs</hi> of one of them; and though, when he came upon a viſitation, he might 'chuſe to make but a ſhort ſtay,' he would, by reaſon of his ſuperiority in dignity and influence, be able to effect more 'terrible things' than all the Epiſcopalians put together, ſhould they be the majority. Moſt certainly, he would not be ſuch a Biſhop as is deſired, if this 'majority' would be 'almoſt, if not quite, as likely' to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their ſchemes 'without ever ſeeing him, as with ſeeing him now and then.' This
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:011598_0086_0F877A91268AB300"/>
writer would make us believe, if Epiſcopalians, by becoming the majority, 'had power, there is no reaſon to think they would be oppreſſive; for they are not oppreſſive in the Colonies where they actually have it: Or that they would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, for they could not with any modeſty, or any hope of ſucceſs, ſuch laws againſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, as the Diſſenters have not attempted againſt them.' Is an eſtabliſhment, obliging Diſſenters to pay, in common with Epiſcopalians, towards the ſupport of the church of England, no degree of oppreſſion? Such an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been attempted 'with ſucceſs,' if not with 'modeſty' in one or two of the Colonies, where Epiſcopalians are the majority;—Nay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in New-York, where there are ten to one that are not Epiſcopalians, epiſcopal art and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, if I have not been miſinformed, has ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one County to this ſame kind of oppreſſion. So that, inſtead of there being no reaſon to think there would be ſuch oppreſſive eſtabliſhments in all the Colonies, there is the higheſt reaſon to think this would be the caſe, if Epiſcopalians ſhould become the majority. It is added, if the zeal of the New-England Clergy threatens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> danger, Biſhops would temper it, as they have done in England, inſtead of inflaming it.' It would tend greatly to the eaſe of our minds, if this could be as ſtrongly proved, as it is here affirmed. Biſhops have not been remarkable, in any ages that are paſt, for 'tempering, inſtead of inflaming', a zeal in their Clergy that portended danger.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, it appears, that this writer had no good foundation for his hope, 'that the Doctor would, on conſidering further, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reconcile his Countrymen to the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:011598_0086_0F877A91268AB300"/>
of Biſhops'; that is, ſuch Biſhops as the plan propoſes ſhould be ſent to the Colonies. Far from being in the leaſt diſpoſed to this, he was abundantly confirmed in the reaſonableneſs of what he had wrote to prevent ſuch a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, by the weakneſs of this lame effort to remove away the objections he had made againſt the planned American Epiſcopate.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR <hi>Chandler</hi> now appears again in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſeemingly pleaſed, that the offered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections could, 'within a much ſmaller com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, be anſwered and confuted.' Without all doubt, was he to be the judge, the confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be accounted abſolutely complete; but, it is to be remembered, not he, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Public are the determiners in this caſe: and, poſſibly they may think, the feeble attempt he has made to invalidate theſe objections, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a confirmation, than a confutation of them.</p>
            <p>I COMPLAINED of the Doctor for giving us only a long ſtring of needleſs queſtions, inſtead of good reaſoning, in order to juſtify the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed plan for an American Epiſcopate. This took up one paragraph. In the next, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was, 'What right have they to this Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate? How came they by it'? And here I was explicit and large in endeavouring to ſhow, that they had no ſuch right. What ſays the Doctor? He replies, 'I am unable to account for ſo great a confuſion of ideas as diſcovers it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in theſe two paragraphs.' If the firſt of theſe paragraphs 'diſcovers any confuſion of ideas,' it muſt be a confuſion of them in his own mind, or in his manner of expreſſing them; for it was nothing more than a repetition of his own queſtions, with this application of them, 'Surely he could not imagine, that any man of
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:011598_0087_0F877A91A5536F68"/>
good underſtanding would be otherwiſe moved by them, than to wonder he ſhould only harangue, when it was his buſineſs to argue!' As to the 'confuſion' in the other paragraph, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where diſcovered, unleſs in what he has ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. And, in truth, his arguing here very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſcovers, that his conceptions of it were indiſtinct, or rather that he did not underſtand it; though it was expreſſed as clearly and fully as any thing that was offered on the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. Dr. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> ſays he, 'ſeems very ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to deny that the church of England in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica has any right to the Epiſcopate propoſed; but then he declares himſelf perfectly willing we ſhould have it.' It is impoſſible, if he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in his mind a clear and juſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I had ſaid, that he ſhould affirm 'I had declared myſelf perfectly willing they ſhould have the propoſed Epiſcopate,' unleſs he had uttered a downright falſhood. I challenges him to produce any ſentence in this paragraph, or in any other part of my anſwer, in which this is declared either directly, or even conſequentially. It is indeed a flat contradiction to all that I had ſaid. What he means, in the following words, by my 'chooſing, perhaps, that this Epiſcopate ſhould be granted as a matter of favour, rather than of right,' is beyond me to inveſtigate. I ſaid not a word about 'favour' in this reſpect; but confined myſelf wholly to the matter of 'right.' It muſt therefore be owing to ſome ſtrange 'confuſion in his ideas,' that he ſhould go on, and inquire, 'What need is there of this diſtinction, and to what purpoſe will it ſerve, if it is not to operate againſt us?' This is a 'diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion' intirely of his own framing. It never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into my heart, not is there a word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:011598_0087_0F877A91A5536F68"/>
in this whole paragraph that could lead him to make it. It is to me altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, how he came to think of it. He proceeds, 'Our claim is, that we may be upon an equal footing with the other denominations in America.' I have more than once affirmed, and abundantly proved, in theſe papers, that they are upon this equal footing; and call upon him to prove the contrary. Says he, 'In order to this, [our being upon an equal footing it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that we ſhould be allowed the enjoyment of <hi>our eccleſiaſtical conſtitution</hi> in the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat manner, as it is enjoyed by them.' By '<hi>our eccleſiaſtical conſtitution,</hi>' he muſt mean here the conſtitution of the church of England; but to enjoy this in as compleat a manner, as other denominations enjoy their's, is not to enjoy it agreeably to the propoſed plan, but to the utter ſubverſion of it; as will preſently appear. He goes on, 'of our eccleſiaſtical conſtitution Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops make an eſſential part, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Epiſcopate we cannot enjoy it.' Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they <hi>compleatly</hi> enjoy it with Biſhops, unleſs they have authority over the Laity as well as Clergy; for ſuch authority is an <hi>eſſential</hi> part of the conſtitution. Nay further, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution cannot be <hi>compleatly</hi> enjoyed without <hi>ſpiritual courts,</hi> and the exerciſe of epiſcopal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the <hi>preciſe way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> that has been ſolemnly eſtabliſhed by King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Doctor has here inſenſibly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove a great deal too much, unleſs he intended to give us a remote inſinuation of what might be expected, ſhould the propoſed plan be complied with, namely, that the church of England was not yet in the full and compleat enjoyment of her conſtitution; her enjoyment muſt riſe ſtill much higher. He adds, 'Our
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:011598_0088_0F877A92959A8098"/>
claim is juſtified by the common principles of human nature, of the chriſtian religion, and of civil ſociety' If ſo, the claim is as well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a claim can be. But what proof has he given us that their claim is thus founded? It follows in theſe moſt remarkable words, 'We call it a right becauſe all good writers agree in calling a right thus founded by that name.' What is this to the purpoſe? Who ever queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, whether a claim thus founded might be called a right? His buſineſs was to prove, that their claim, or right, to the propoſed Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate was thus founded, that is, upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he had before ſpecified. But not a word is offered in proof of this. It reſts upon nothing more than his naked affirmation. He ſays yet further, 'For words we do not contend. What we inſiſt upon is this, that the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland is, in all reſpects, fairly entitled to as full a toleration in the Colonies, as other churches in the Colonies enjoy. And it cannot be thus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated unleſs it be ſuffered to EXIST IN ALL ITS PARTS.' If the church of England cannot be FULLY TOLERATED in the Colonies, unleſs it is ſuffered to EXIST IN ALL ITS PARTS, it is at once evident, that we muſt have in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca not only Biſhops, but Deans, Prebends, Arch-Deacons, ſpiritual courts with their Chancellors, and the whole train of officers employed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging that SPIRITUAL authority which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed over both Clergy and Laity: For theſe are PARTS of the conſtituted church of England. It is ſtrange the Doctor, while arguing for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than that limited Epiſcopate he had propoſed, ſhould endeavour to do it upon a plan that would make it reaſonable, that the church of England ſhould exiſt here IN ALL RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPECTS,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:011598_0088_0F877A92959A8098"/>
and IN ALL ITS PARTS, as it does at home. But he ought to know, that in order to this, ſomething more than 'a fair and full toleration' would be neceſſary. There muſt be an ESTABLISHMENT, which he will not allow he ever thought of; as we ſhall ſee preſently. The plain truth is; as it was 'our buſineſs as opponents,' we have ſhewn, that the Colony-Epiſcopalians are treated in preciſely 'the ſame manner' with the other denominations—They are all, without exception, upon the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of liberty, in virtue of the granted tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if Epiſcopalians do not enjoy any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual privileges ſo fully as any of the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, it is not owing, in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to the want of a PERMISSION herefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; for the GRANTED PERMISSION is the ſame to all; making no manner of difference between one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination and another.</p>
            <p>I HAD ſaid, appeal anſwered p. 180, 'If Epiſcopalians think Biſhops, in the appropriated ſenſe, were conſtituted by CHRIST, or his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, we object not a word againſt their having as many of them as they pleaſe, if they will be content to have them with authority ALTOGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER FROM CHRIST. But they both claim and deſire, a great deal more. They want to be diſtinguiſhed 'by having Biſhops upon the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a STATE ESTABLISHMENT'? I then went on to argue ſomewhat largely againſt their having a right to ſuch an eſtabliſhment. The Doctor replies, 'Where did he learn that we want Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops upon ſuch a footing?' and affirms, 'That I could learn it, neither from the appeal, or from any thing that has been publiſhed on the ſide of the church;' yea, he ſolemnly declares, 'I know of no ſuch thing, I have ſeen nothing that has

been written, ſince the reign of Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> either in England or America, in print or in manuſcript, that indicates ſuch a deſire'. He goes on yet farther, and ſays, 'I have met with nothing in converſation with Clergymen or Laymen, in or out of convention, from whence I can learn or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that there is an Epiſcopalian, within the Britiſh dominions, that aims at or expects an Epiſcopate here upon the footing of a ſtate eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment'. The Doctor, when he wrote thus, muſt have had in his thoughts an eſtabliſhment for the ſupport of the epiſcopal Clergy, either ſuperior, or inferior, or both. In this view, an eſtabliſhment was not propoſed in the 'appeal,' nor is it pleaded for in the writings on the ſide of the church that I know of; nor can I ſay, that it was ever mentioned by the convention: Though I am far from thinking it to be a truth, that there is no Clergyman or Layman, in the American Colonies, that does not expect and wiſh, that an eſtabliſhment upon this footing, will be brought into event ſooner or later. I ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about ſuch an eſtabliſhment. But an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and a ſtate one too, muſt take place, or the church of England here can never have the Epiſcopate that has been propoſed and deſired. The Doctor will own, the Epiſcopate that has been planned for the Colonies is widely different from that which exiſts at home. American Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhall have no authority over the Laity;— their ſpiritual courts muſt not be held in this part of the world;—and they themſelves are to be confined in their power within certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed boundaries. How is all this to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed? Muſt there not be the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtate? Can it be effected in any
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:011598_0089_0F877A9420CCED48"/>
other way? And if the ſtate interpoſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Colony Epiſcopate, it muſt be under their patronage, guidance, and controul, as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of its powers. And what is this, in real meaning, but an eſtabliſhment? The church of England, in this caſe, will be diſtinguiſhed from all the other denominations; and, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only tolerated as they are, will be as truly, if not as fully, an eſtabliſhed church here, as it is in Great-Britain. But Colony-Epiſcopalians have no right to be thus diſtinguiſhed; as was abundantly proved in anſwer to the appeal, to which the Doctor has ſaid nothing by way of reply, for no other reaſon, it may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but becauſe he could not. If he had here pointed out, as it was his proper buſineſs to do, the way in which the Epiſcopate propoſed in the appeal, and by the writers on the ſide of the church, could be carried into effect without a <hi>ſtate-eſtabliſhment,</hi> he would have ſaid ſomething to the purpoſe; but, having wiſely avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, we are left to think, the American Epiſcopate they have planned is virtually, and in reality of ſenſe, the ſame thing with a planned epiſcopal eſtabliſhment. It is to us incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, how their deſired Epiſcopate could, in any other way, take place in the Colonies. In vain therefore does he complain, that 'they are abuſed by petulent tongues and abuſive pens for being charged with aiming at a ſtate eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.' We ſhould feel 'remorſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if we did not without heſitation' object againſt the propoſed Epiſcopate for this very reaſon, becauſe, by aiming at it, an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Epiſcopacy in America is equally aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at. The impartial Public are to determine, not Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> whether they are juſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or 'unwarrantably condemned.'</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="unknown:011598_0090_0F877A94D244E910"/>HE ſtill goes on, in his defence, a number of pages; but, as there is ſcarce any thing in them that relates to the <hi>grand point,</hi> and nothing, ſo far as I am able to judge, of ſufficient weight to call for particular notice; if the reader will only compare what he has offered in theſe pages, with the anſwer to the appeal, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly willing, without ſaying a word more, to leave the diſpute to the determination of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judgment. But, at the ſame time, I would aſſure the Doctor, that his 'fear,' leaſt he ſhould have 'ſomewhat broken in upon my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,' is entirely groundleſs. He may fondly imagine, he has 'pleaded the cauſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took' with ſuch ſuperiority of good ſenſe, and ſound reaſoning, as to give me 'diſturbance;' but he has been the occaſion of no other unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to me than that of diſappointment; for he has fallen much below my wiſhes as well as expectations; not having wrote ſo as to give opportunity for a tryal of ſtrength. He has candidly excuſed my inſufficiency, as it was my hard lot to prove, 'that good is evil, and evil good; that darkneſs is light, and light is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which could not be done without 'ſuch a genius and abilities as are not to be found'. I wiſh I could make ſo good an apology for him. His taſk was eaſy. He had only to plead the cauſe of truth; and yet, he has done it with ſo little appearance of ingenuous ſolid arguing, that, I fear, his cauſe will ſuffer in the opinion of all that are capable of diſcernment.</p>
            <p>I INTENDED to have come to a concluſion here, by preſenting to the reader, in one view, the ſum of what has been ſaid on both ſides, that he might the more eaſily make a judgment in the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

room for a matter of much greater importance; the treatment of the Preſbyterian church at New-York, in relation to the charter they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for, both to the government there, and to the King at home. And I the rather chuſe to hold this up to public view, as it is an alarm to all the Colonies on the Continent, giving them ſolemn notice what they may expect, ſhould Epiſcopalians ever come to have the ſuperiority in their influence. Nothing has been offered, in a way of reaſoning, againſt the planned Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Epiſcopate, that carries with it ſuch FEEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING FORCE as the negative to the prayer of this petition, with the reaſons upon which it is grounded.</p>
            <p>THAT the reader may perceive the propriety of my introducing this affair, I would juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind him, that the Doctor, in his appeal, had ſpoken of the 'mildneſs, tenderneſs, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Engliſh Biſhops for a courſe of years paſt;' inſomuch, that they had 'ſcarcely afforded an inſtance of reaſonable complaint, eſpecially to Diſſenters:' In anſwer whereto, he was told of the rejection of the petition of the Presbyterian church at New-York for a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;' which was effected through the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, particularly, of the Biſhop of London, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, without all doubt, by ungenerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations from Epiſcopalians in America.</p>
            <p>As I am not, from perſonal knowledge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this affair any more than the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, what I propoſe is to hand to the Public, in an appendix, the clear, full, and yet conciſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, which has been tranſmitted to me from New-York: previouſly giving this intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the facts, contained in the account to

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>THE true hiſtory of the various applications of the Preſbyterians of the City of New-York for a charter, and of their various diſappointments, is ſuccinctly this.</p>
            <p>A number of Gentlemen purchaſed a lot of ground in 1719, for the erecting of a church to worſhip in, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the mode of the eſtabliſhed perſuaſion in North-Britain. There was not then in this Colony, nor is there to this day, any general proviſion made by law, for the regulation of churches, or for the ſupport of the Miniſters of the goſpel—It is therefore expedient in this Country, for the preſervation of the temporalities of every church, and the maintenance of good order, that the congregation be incorporated—Charters for ſuch purpoſes had been granted to the low Dutch, and epiſcopal churches; and the Colony being peopled from Scotland as well as England, the Scotch founders of the Preſbyterian church in New-York, thought they had reaſon to hope government would not be leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them, than to the Emigrants from South-Britain; and could not imagine that the ſons of the church of Scotland, united to England by act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the ties of allegiance as natural born ſubjects, were not to have equal countenance, with thoſe of the foreign reformed church of the united Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, between which and the church of Scotland, there is no eſſential diſparity, and very little even in point of meer form. With confidence therefore they preſented a petition to Col. <hi>Schyler,</hi> who commanded in chief in 1721, for letters of incorporation. The Epiſcopalians oppoſed the grant, though they were themſelves then juſt emerging from their obſcurity; for, at that time, the low Dutch congregations figured
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:011598_0092_0F877A9625838FB8"/>
as the firſt churches in Town, and are ſtill the moſt numerous, though many of their richeſt families are gone off for the ſake of the language, to the Engliſh churches. When Governor <hi>Burnet</hi> arrived, the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians renewed their attempt, and the veſtry of trinity church their oppoſition. They were heard againſt the petition, and to the ſcandal of the council-board were indulged in their contemptible narrow minded bigotry. The Governor, though favorably inclined to his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was unwilling to proceed without direction from home—He wrote to the board of trade in 1724, and their Lordſhips conſulted Counſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion in the following terms.</p>
            <p>'UPON conſideration of the ſeveral acts of unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that have paſſed in Great-Britain I am of opinion, that they do not extend to New-York, and conſequently an act of toleration is of no uſe in that Province; and therefore, as there is no provincial act for uniformity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the church of England, I am of opinion, that by law ſuch patents of incorporation may be granted as by the petition is deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Weſt,</hi> Aug. 20. 1724.</p>
            <p>No charter could however be obtained, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by ſucceſsleſs ſollicitations, the congregation for the preſervation of their eſtate, veſted it in March 1730, in the general aſſembly of the church of Scotland, who ſtill hold the fee, but have iſſued a declaration continuing the application of it, to the pious uſes, for which it was originally purchaſed.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all oppoſition, the Scotch church flouriſhed under the long and laborious miniſtry of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> who ſettled here in 1727; and when the Lutherans applied for a charter to Lieutenant Governor <hi>Delancy</hi> in 1759, the Preſbyterians made a third application—The Lutherans were encouraged by gentlemen then in the council, who promiſed to be-friend them; and the Preſbyterians by favourable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from the Lieutenant Governor, who had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently declared his abhorrence of the former oppoſition as illegal and unreaſonable; and when the petition was preferred, he received Mr. <hi>Boſtwick,</hi> the then Miniſter, and his Elders and Deacons, politely, and profeſſed
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:011598_0092_0F877A9625838FB8"/>
his readineſs to grant their requeſt, if the Council would concur.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Smith,</hi> ſince one of the Judges, was one of the board, when the petition of the Presbyterians was read, and referred to a committee; but no opportunity was given for a trial of Mr. <hi>Delancey</hi>'s ſincerity: for Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the only Non-epiſcopalian member, was choſen chairman of the Committee, and was unable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon the reſt of the council to meet; and, if he could, would have loſt his own vote by being in the chair.</p>
            <p>OBLIGING the Lutherans at that time, if any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention there really was, would have diſcovered a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality too barefaced; and therefore, while the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians petition was neglected, that of the Lutherans was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ily pretended to be put in a way for obtaining the royal order from home; and thus the council were to be behind the curtain, and avoid popular cenſure.—It ſo happened however, and perhaps by intriegues from this quarter, that the Lords of trade could not ſee it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to adviſe the gratification of their requeſt; and accordingly a letter came from their Lordſhips to Mr. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olden,</hi> which cut off the reaſonable expectations of that ſociety of loyal Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>THE Presbyterians had experienced many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for want of a charter; and though the juſt, and generous adminiſtration of Sir <hi>Henry Moore,</hi> prompted them to make a fourth attempt, yet upon a doubt now ſtarted, whether his commiſſion authoriſed him to grant incorporating patents, and from a want of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his council, it was thought moſt prudent to lay the caſe, of this diſtant diſperſion of the church of Scotland, before his Majeſty—A petition was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly prepared, and tranſmitted with a draft of the charter deſired in March, 1767.</p>
            <p>THE negotiation of this buſineſs was truſted to the late Dr. <hi>Samuel Chandler,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Debert</hi>; but it fell ſolely upon the latter, Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> dying about the time of the arrival of the papers in London. The Earl of Dartmouth, ſo renowned for his catholiciſm, and readineſs to promote the intereſt of our common chriſtianity, then preſided at the board of trade, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011598_0093_0F877A96DAC414D0"/>
fully into an opinion of the reaſonableneſs of the requeſt, and adviſed Mr. <hi>Debert</hi> to put the petition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King's hand, before the co-operation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain friends, whoſe aid was aſked, could be obtained.</p>
            <p>HIS Majeſty was pleaſed to lay the petition before the Lords of the privy council, and to refer it to the board of trade. The Lords Commiſſioners for Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation affairs ſuſpended a report, until they had an anſwer, from Sir <hi>Henry Moore,</hi> to a letter they wrote to him on the 29th of July, 1766.</p>
            <p>THIS letter was accompanied with a copy of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and the draft of the charter—They were all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Governor to his council; and on the 17th of July, 1767, the petitioners offered to attend the call of the board, for the ſupport of their allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by a petition which was that day read in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and left with their clerk, for the uſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.—A few days after Mr. <hi>Horſemanden,</hi> as the oldeſt member of the board, was waited upon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a time to receive a requeſt for this purpoſe, but declined it.</p>
            <p>NO report was delivered until the 15th of April, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the letter from the Lords of trade arrived here on the 4th of November preceding, and there were many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate meetings of the council. I believe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes will prove that the members met every week.— At one of theſe meetings, in the latter end of March, the Chief Juſtice was called out, and in anſwer to an intreaty for a ſpeedy report to the Governor, ſaid with tartneſs '<hi>That the matter need not be puſhed, and that he wiſhed the government had not troubled them with the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>'. A Gentleman took the liberty to ſay, that all the Lords of trade required was to be informed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the allegations were true; to which he replied, '<hi>Of that there is no doubt.</hi>'</p>
            <p>THE report appears, however, by its date, to have been finiſhed about that time. We do not learn, that the committee were waited upon <hi>now</hi> by the veſtry of trinity church, nor was it neceſſary, as their church war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ens were of the council. Mr. Chief Juſtice was one, and Mr. <hi>Reade</hi> the other, and as chairman of the committee had the honour to make their report.
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:011598_0093_0F877A96DAC414D0"/>
That it was not earlier delivered, may be imputed to a deſire to render the petition abortive, or to the then tickliſh ſtate of things, a diſſolution of the aſſembly in purſuance of a ſeptennial act being at hand, and <hi>James Delancey</hi> named as a candidate for the City of New-York, who had two uncles in council, zealous for the public confidence, and intereſted in retarding a report which would naturally give offence; but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's importunity forced them to ſpeak out.—It does not appear that there was a ſingle member diſſenting to this report.</p>
            <p>THE petitioners aſked for a copy on the 20th of April, 1767, but this requeſt was denied, and by this means their adverſaries had frequent opportunity for ex parte repreſentations againſt the meaſure, in a courſe of private correſpondence; which was doubtleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Clergy, and the draftſmen who fabricated the report.</p>
            <p>SIR <hi>Henry Moore</hi> loſt no time in tranſmitting it.— The petitioners (who one would imagine had a right to be heard) were ignorant of its contents, and under all poſſible diſadvantages; nor could give any ſutable directions to their Agent.—Whether the council kept the ſecret from the Epiſcopalians without doors, judge you. The Biſhop of London, notwithſtanding the boaſted moderation of the order, appeared twice to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the petition before the Commiſſioners for trade and Plantations, as thought he grant of the privilege, of ſecuring a houſe ſet apart by Proteſtants, worſhipping according to the uſage in North Britain, was repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the benevolence enjoined by the goſpel of CHRIST: and though Lord <hi>Clare,</hi> whoſe zeal for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the rights of private judgment, may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from a well known event in the hiſtory of his life, was then premier at the board of trade, a report was made to his Majeſty, which ſoon after iſſued in a final rejection of the petition. In this report, the queſtion, Whether his Majeſty, conſiſtently with the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations he was under by his coronation oath, founded on the act of the fifth of Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> entitled, 'an act for ſecuring the church of England as by law eſtabliſhed,' could grant the requeſted charter, being left undecided; the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:011598_0094_0F877A979D266ED0"/>
report was, it would be 'inexpedient, upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of general policy, to give the Preſbyterian church of New-York any other privileges than it is entitled to by the law of toleration.'</p>
            <p>WHATEVER liberties the people of England may think fit to take at this day, in remarking upon the acts of their Sovereign, the Americans conceive themſelves bound to ſpeak on ſuch occaſions, with the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found deference. The light, however, in which his ſervants have thought fit to hold up the requeſt of the Scotch church of New-York, every man may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs conſider and animadvert upon with ſome free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They are anſwerable to the whole world for their conduct; and have proceeded upon a principle, that deſerves the conſideration of all the Colonies. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has contributed more to the acquiſition and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of theſe eſſential parts of the Empire, than the ſeaſonable and well policed aſſurance we have had for free indulgence in matters of religion: And a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirit will be as ruinous to our peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as it is diſgraceful to a Gentleman, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with religion and philoſophy, freedom of enquiry, and human felicity. We have ſeen an A—m-ſ—n of corrupt and diſſolute M-n—rs, mercileſsly graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at our liberties and eſtates; and it is ſome conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our diſappointment in a requeſt friendly to the rights of conſcience, may be attributed to men, whoſe influence at the court of a good King, will probably very ſoon be at an end.</p>
            <p>I ONLY add, that although there have long ſince been petitions preferred <hi>here,</hi> by the French Proteſtants, and the Low Dutch churches of Orange Town, New-Hempſted, Marble Town, Bodcheſter and Wawarſing, nothing final is determined upon them; while it is the uſual practice, to grant charters to the epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal churches without the leaſt heſitation. It is not long, ſince the little congregation at Albany was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with power to hold an immenſe revenue. Another patent is iſſued to provide for Clergymen's widows, by an income of many thouſands per annum; and at this very juncture the Society for propagating the goſpel, though reſtrained from taking real eſtates at home, are aſking for grants of the crown lands here in mortmain for the epiſcopal churches, to the amount
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:011598_0094_0F877A979D266ED0"/>
of thouſands of acres. In ſome inſtances they have been gratified already. Theſe facts are mentioned, to ſhew the ſpirit of the oppoſition to the petitions of the non-epiſcopal churches, who, inſtead of ſoliciting for ample endowments, deſire nothing more than <hi>purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> eſtates, barely ſufficient for the ſupport of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and to juſtify our fears that the preſent ſtruggles of the Miſſionaries and others to introduce Epiſcopacy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to America, originate from ambitious deſigns for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing an o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT was occaſioned by a motion made in the houſe of repreſentatives, in behalf of the Paſtors and Deacons of the church to which I am related, that they might be ſtrengthened in their endeavours to ſecure the payment of an annuity, given to them by will, out of the rents of a valuable farm, to be by them yearly diſpoſed of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for the benefit of a well-diſpoſed, and promiſing, but needy, ſtudent at <hi>Harvard</hi>-College, in Cambridge. It was at once thought, that this was a matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concern; and, accordingly, an act was prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and paſſed by both houſes, (in which, unleſs we ſhould except one or two, there were no epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal members) and readily ſigned by the Governor; taking in all Proteſtant denominations, EPISCOPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIANS by name: And the whole was done of their own m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er motion, under the influence of candor, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a becoming ſenſe of the regard that ought to be paid to the rule of right, without partiality.

made. The act, wherein it is neceſſary it ſhould be recited, is as follows,</p>
            <p>'<hi>WHEREAS many grants and donations have heretofore been made by ſundry well-diſpoſed perſons, in and by ſuch expreſſions and terms as plainly ſhow it was the intent and expectation of ſuch grantors and donors, that their ſeveral grants and donations ſhould take effect ſo as that the eſtates granted ſhould go in ſucceſſion: But doubts have ariſen in what caſes ſuch donations and grants may ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſo as to go in ſucceſſion</hi>:</p>
            <p>For aſcertaining whereof:</p>
            <p>'BE it enacted by the GOVERNOR, COUNCIL, and houſe of REPRESENTATIVES, That the Deacons of all the ſeveral Proteſtant churches, not being epiſcopal churches, and the <hi>Church Wardens</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> churches, are, and ſhall be, deemed ſo far <hi>bodies corporate,</hi> as to take in <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> all grants and donations, whether real or perſonal, made either to their ſeveral churches, the poor of their churches, or to them and their ſucceſſors, and to ſue and defend in all actions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame; and wherever the Miniſters, Elders or Veſtry ſhall in ſuch original grants or donations have been joined with ſuch D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Miniſter or Miniſters of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral proteſtant churches of whatever denomination, are and ſhall be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ons touching the ſame; ſaving that nothing in this act ſhall be conſtrued to make void any final judgment of any court of common law or Judge of probate; ſaving alſo, that no alienation of any lands belonging to churches hereafter made by the Deacons without the conſent of the church or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the church for that purpoſe appointed, or by Church W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rdens without the conſent of the Veſtry, ſhall be ſufficient to paſs the ſame. And that no alienation hereafter made by Miniſters of lands by them held in ſucceſſion ſhall be valid any longer than during
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:011598_0095_0F877A98638A1948"/>
ſuch alienors continuing Miniſters, unleſs ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be Miniſters of particular Towns, Diſtricts, or Precincts, and make ſuch alienation with the conſent of ſuch Towns, Diſtricts, or Precincts, or unleſs ſuch Miniſters ſo aliening be Miniſters of Epiſcopal Churches, and the ſame be done with the conſent of the Veſtry'.—</p>
            <p>HAD <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> at New-York been in the exerciſe of like candor and impartiality with <hi>Non-epiſcopalians</hi> in this Province, their Preſbyterian brethren would have met with no difficulty in obtaining, from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, the charter they deſired: Nor, had they ſent no ungenerous unfriendly repreſentations to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified Clergymen at home, is it in the leaſt probable the KING would have rejected the petition they made to him. As there was no <hi>epiſcopal</hi> oppoſition to the <hi>Maſſachuſetts act,</hi> it readily obtained the KING's <hi>fiat.</hi> And there is no reaſon to think, but he would as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily have granted the <hi>charter</hi> petitioned for, by the New-York Preſbyterians, as it meant preciſely the ſame thing with the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-act,</hi> had not epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palian Yorkers, in council, or out of council, or both, tranſmitted ſuch illiberal accounts, to great men in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as excited their zeal, and urged them on to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to bring this petition to naught.</p>
            <p>IT is to be hoped, the generous candor, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial juſtice, exemplified by the non-epiſcopal Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Province, will have ſome good effect upon Epiſcopalians in the other Colonies. It is powerfully adapted to ſuch a purpoſe; and cannot well fail, if duly conſidered, of putting to ſhame that narrowneſs of ſpirit, that bigotry of ſentiment, and party-partiality, which are inconſiſtent with a freedom in doing to others, as we would they ſhould do to us. It may reaſonably be expected, the noble example of undiſtinguiſhed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and goodneſs, that has been brought to view, will engage the New-York Epiſcopalians, from a ſenſe of honour, friendlineſs, impartiality, and juſtice, heartily to join with the Preſbyterians there in endeavours, that they may be put upon the ſame equitable footing with themſelves, by being favoured with a charter of incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration for the temporalities of their church. Unleſs there ſhould be the diſcovery of ſuch a temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:011598_0096_0F877A9934EAC0C0"/>
in vain it will be to expect, that our fears, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the propoſed American Epiſcopate, ſhould be ſilenced. If Epiſcopalians of inferior ſtation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſmall importance, can, by handing accounts to dignitaries at home, effect ſuch miſchief to the other denominations, what may not be feared from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Biſhops, reſiding in the Colonies!</p>
