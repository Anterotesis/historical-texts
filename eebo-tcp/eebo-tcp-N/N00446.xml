            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But all that I have hitherto said, is no more than an entrance into the History of our <hi>Eliot.</hi> Such an <hi>Enoch</hi> as <hi>he,</hi> must have something more than these things recorded of him; his <hi>Walk with God,</hi> must be more largely laid before the world, as a thing that would bespeak us all to be <hi>Followers</hi> no less than we shall be <hi>Admirers</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>He had not passed many <hi>Turns</hi> in the world, before he knew the meaning of a saving <hi>Turn</hi> from the Vanities of an Unregenerate State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto God in Christ, by a true Repentance; he had the singular happiness and priviledge of an <hi>early Conversion</hi> from the Ways, which <hi>Original Sin</hi> disposes all men unto.

his Bones in our <hi>New-England;</hi> it was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with <hi>him,</hi> that contributed more than a little to the Accomplishment of our <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha,</hi> for that work unto which the most High designed him. His liberal <hi>Education,</hi> having now the Addition of <hi>Religion,</hi> to direct it, and improve it, it gave such a <hi>Biass</hi> to his young Soul, as quickly discovered it self in very signal instances. His first Appearance in the world after his Education in the <hi>University,</hi> was in the too <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>unthankful</hi> but very <hi>necessary</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of a <hi>School-master,</hi> which Employment he discharged with a good fidelity. And as this <hi>first Essay</hi> of his Improvement was no more Disgrace unto <hi>him,</hi> than it was unto the famous <hi>Hieron, Whitaker, Vines,</hi> and others, that they <hi>thus</hi> began to be serviceable; so it rather prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, for the further service, which his mind was now set upon. He was of worthy Mr. <hi>Thomas Wilson'</hi>s mind, that the calling of a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> was the only one wherein a man might be more serviceable to the Church of God, than in that of a <hi>School-master.</hi> Wherefore having De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated himself unto God betimes, he could not Reconcile himself to any lesser way of Serving his Creator and Redeemer, than the Sacred <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi> of the Gospel; but, alas, where should he have Opportunities for the Exercising of it? The <hi>Laudian, Grotian,</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Faction in the Church-of-<hi>England,</hi> in the prosecution of their Grand plot, for the reducing of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:000568_0018_0FA7125DCE6034D0"/>
unto a moderate sort of <hi>Popery,</hi> had pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>this</hi> as one of their cursed methods for it; namely, to <hi>creeple</hi> as fast as they could, all the Learned, Godly, Painful Ministers of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and invent certain <hi>Shiboleths</hi> for the detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the destroying of such men as were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Friends to the Reformation. 'Twas now a time when there were every day multiplied and imposed those unwarrantable <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the Worship of God, by which the Conscience of our considerate <hi>Eliot</hi> counted the <hi>second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> notoriously violated; it was a time, when such memorable Bishops as <hi>Wren,</hi> and <hi>Pierce,</hi> with others of that <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> silenced, censured, and ruined such Ministers as would not Read a <hi>Book for Sports</hi> on the Lords Dayes, or did but use a <hi>Prayer</hi> of their own conceiving before or after Sermon, or did but <hi>Preach</hi> on an Afternoon as well as in a morning, or on a Lect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, or on a Market, or did but explain the <hi>Church-Catechism,</hi> or in any wise discountenance the <hi>old Pagan</hi> Superstitions or <hi>new beastly</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries among their miserable Neighbours. Moreover, 'twas now a time, when some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of those amiable people which had the Nick-name of <hi>Puritans</hi> put upon them, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported themselves, with their whole Families and Interests, into the Desarts of <hi>America,</hi> that they might here peaceably Erect <hi>Congregational Churches,</hi> and therein attend and maintain all the pure Institutions of the Lord Jesus Christ;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000568_0019_0FA7125F9E2C1348"/>
having the encouragement of <hi>Royal Charters,</hi> that they should <hi>never</hi> have any interruption in the Enjoyment of those <hi>precious and pleasant things.</hi> Here was a prospect which quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the devout Soul of our young <hi>Eliot,</hi> unto a Remove into <hi>New-England,</hi> while it was yet a <hi>Land not sown;</hi> he quickly Listed himself among those valiant Souldiers of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, who cheerfully encountred first the Perils of the <hi>Atlantick Ocean,</hi> and then the Fatigues of the <hi>New-English Wilderness,</hi> that they might have an undisturbed Communion with Him in His Appointments here. And thus did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times procure himself the consolation of-having afterwards and for-ever a room in that Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God, <hi>I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, and the Love of thine espousuls, when thou wentest after me into the Wilderness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On his first Arrival to <hi>New-England,</hi> he soon joyned himself unto the Church at <hi>Boston;</hi> 'twas <hi>Church-work</hi> that was his Errand hither. Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> the Pastor of that Church, was gone back into <hi>England,</hi> that he might perfect the Settlement of his Affairs; and in his Absence, young Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> was he that supplied his place. Upon the Return of Mr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> that Church was intending to have made Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue, and their Teacher; but it was thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> had engaged unto a select number of his pious and christian Friends in <hi>England,</hi> that if they should come into these
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000568_0020_0FA7126005F102E8"/>
Parts before he should be in the pastoral Care of any other people, he would give himself to <hi>Them,</hi> and be for <hi>Their</hi> Service. It happened, that these Friends transported themselves hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the year after him; and chose their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation at the Town which they called <hi>Roxbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> A Church being now gathered at this place, he was in a little while <hi>Ordained</hi> unto the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and Ruling of that holy Society.

                  <hi>I prayer,</hi> as being in a manner made up of it. Could the walls of his old <hi>Study</hi> speak, they would even Ravish us with a Relation of the many hundred and thousand fervent <hi>Prayers</hi> which he there poured out before the Lord. He not only made it his dayly practice to <hi>enter into that closet, and shut his Door, and pray to his Father in Secret,</hi> but he would not rarely <hi>set</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part whole <hi>days</hi> for prayer with Fasting, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places before the God of Heaven. <hi>Prayer</hi> solemnized with <hi>Fasting</hi> was indeed so agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto him, that I have sometimes thought he might justly inherit the Name of, <hi>Johannes Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junator,</hi> or, <hi>John the Faster,</hi> which for the like reason was put upon one of the Renowned Ancients. Especially, when there was any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable difficulty before him, he took this way to encounter and overcome it; being of Dr. <hi>Prestons</hi> mind, <hi>That when we would have any great things to be accomplished, the best policy is to work by an Engine which the world sees nothing of.</hi> He could say as the pious <hi>Robert son</hi> did upon his Death-bed, <hi>I thank God, I have loved Faster and Prayer, with all my heart!</hi> If one would have known what that sacred thing, <hi>The spirit of Prayer,</hi> intends, in <hi>him</hi> there might have been seen a most luculent and practical Exposition of it. He kept his heart in a <hi>frame for prayer,</hi> with a marvellous constancy; and was continually provoking all that were about him thereunto.

When he came to an House that he was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with, he could often say, <hi>Come, let us not have a visit without a prayer; let us pray down the Blessing of Heaven on your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before we go.</hi> Especially when he came into a Society of Ministers, before he had sat long with them, they would look to hear him urging, <hi>Brethren, the Lord Jesus takes much notice of what is done and said among his Ministers when they are together; come, let us pray before we part!</hi> And hence also, his whole <hi>Breath</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a sort made up of <hi>ejaculatory prayers,</hi> many scores of which winged Messengers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>HE that will write of <hi>Eliot,</hi> must write of <hi>Charity,</hi> or say nothing. His <hi>Charity</hi> was a Star of the <hi>First Magnitude</hi> in the bright Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation of his Vertues; and the Rays of it were wonderfully various and extensive.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Liberality</hi> to pious Uses, whether publick or private, went much beyond the proportions of his little Estate in the world. Many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Pounds did he freely bestow upon the <hi>poor;</hi> and he would with a very forcible impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity press his Neighbours to joyn with him, in such Beneficences. 'Twas a marvellous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity,</hi> with which he embraced all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Relieving any, that were miserable; &amp; the good people of <hi>Roxbury</hi> doubtless <hi>cannot</hi>

remember (but the <hi>Righteous</hi> God <hi>will!</hi>) how <hi>often,</hi> and with what <hi>Ardors,</hi> with what <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> he became a Beggar to them, for Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions in their Assemblies, to support such needy Objects, as had fallen under his Observation. The poor counted him their <hi>Father,</hi> and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed still unto him, with a filial confidence in their Necessities; and they were more than <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> or <hi>eight,</hi> or indeed than so many <hi>scores,</hi> who received their <hi>portions</hi> of his Bounty. Like that worthy and famous <hi>English</hi> General, he could not perswade himself, <hi>That he held any thing but what he gave away;</hi> but he drove a mighty Trade at such Exercises as he thought would furnish him with <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>after many days</hi> to find the comfort of; and yet after all, he would say like one of the most charitable Souls that ever lived in the World, <hi>That looking over his Accounts, he could no where find the God of Heaven charged a Debtor there.</hi> He did not put off his <hi>Charity,</hi> to be put in his <hi>last Will,</hi> as many who therein shew that their <hi>Charity</hi> is <hi>against their will;</hi> but he was his own <hi>Administrator;</hi> he made his own <hi>Hands</hi> his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors,</hi> and his own <hi>Eyes</hi> his <hi>Overseers.</hi> It has been Remark'd, That <hi>liberal</hi> men are often <hi>long-lived</hi> men; so do they <hi>after many days</hi> find the <hi>Bread</hi> with which they have been willing to keep other men <hi>alive.</hi> The <hi>great age</hi> of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liot was but agreeable to this Remark, &amp; when his Age had unfitted him for almost all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000568_0044_0FA712810EAA2680"/>
and bereaved him of those Gifts &amp; Parts which once he had been Accomplished with, being asked, <hi>How he did?</hi> he would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times answer, <hi>Alas, I have lost every thing; my Understanding leaves me, my Memory fails me, my Utterance fails me; but I thank God, my Charity holds out still; I find</hi> that <hi>rather grows than fails!</hi> And I make no question, That at his Death, his happy Soul was Received, and welcomed, into the <hi>everlasting Habitations,</hi> by many scores got thither before him, of such as his <hi>Charity</hi> had been liberal unto.</p>
               <p>But besides these more <hi>Substantial Expressions</hi> of his <hi>Charity,</hi> hee made the Odours of that <hi>Grace</hi> yet more fragrant unto all that were about him, by that <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

It was an extreme Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to him, that his Wife had attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a considerable skill in <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Chyrurgery,</hi> which enabled her to dispense many safe, good, and useful Medicines, unto the <hi>Poor</hi> that had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for them; and some hundreds of sick &amp; weak and maimed people owed praises to God, for
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000568_0045_0FA712822FE03DA8"/>
for the Benefit, which therein they freely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of her. The good Gentleman, her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would still be casting <hi>Oyl</hi> into the <hi>Flame</hi> of that Charity, wherein she was of her own accord abundantly forward thus to be <hi>doing of good unto all;</hi> and he would urge her to be serviceable into the worst <hi>Enemies</hi> that he had in the world. Never had any man fewer Enemies than he. But once having delivered something in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, which displeased one of his Hearers, the man did passionately abuse him for it, and this both with <hi>Speeches</hi> and with <hi>Writings</hi> that revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him. Yet it happening not long after, that this man gave himself a very dangerous <hi>Wound,</hi> Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> immediately sends his Wife to cure him; who did accordingly. When the man was well he came to thank her; but she took no Rewards; and this <hi>Good man</hi> made him stay and <hi>eat</hi> with him, taking no notice of all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies with which he had loaded him; but by, this Carriage he strangely mollifyed and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Stomach</hi> of his Reviler.</p>
               <p>He was also a great Enemy to all <hi>Contention,</hi> &amp; would ring a loud <hi>Courfeu-Bell</hi> wherever he saw the <hi>Fires</hi> of Animosity. When he heard any Ministers complain, that such and such in their Flocks, were too <hi>difficult</hi> for them, the strain of his Answer still was, <hi>Brother, Compass them!</hi> and <hi>Brother, Learn the meaning of those three little Words, Bear, Forbear, Forgive.</hi> Yea, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations for <hi>Peace,</hi> indeed sometimes almost
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000568_0046_0FA712828DC13998"/>
made him to sacrifice <hi>Right</hi> it self. When there was laid before an Assembly of Ministers, a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Papers, which contained certain matters of Difference and Contention, between some people which our <hi>Eliot</hi> thought should rather unite, with an <hi>Amnesty</hi> upon all their former Quarrels, he (with some limitation of what <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> did upon the like occasion) hastily threw the papers into the Fire before them all, and with a <hi>zeal</hi> for peace, as hot as that <hi>Fire,</hi> said immediately, <hi>Brethren, wonder not at what I have done; I did it on my knees this morning before I came among you.</hi> Such an <hi>excess</hi> (if it were one), flow'd from his Charitable Inclinations to be found among those <hi>Peace-makers</hi> which by following the Exemple of that <hi>Man</hi> who is <hi>our Peace,</hi> come to be called, <hi>The children of God.</hi> Very worthily might he be called an <hi>Ireneus,</hi> as being all for <hi>Peace;</hi> and the Commendation which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> gives unto the Ancient of <hi>that Name,</hi> did belong unto our <hi>Eliot;</hi> he was a <hi>most blessed and a most holy man.</hi> He disliked all sorts of <hi>Bravery;</hi> but yet with an ingenious Note upon the Greek word in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 15. he propounded, <hi>That peace might</hi> brave it <hi>among us.</hi> In short, where-ever he came, it was like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old <hi>John,</hi> with solemn and earnest perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to continual <hi>Apprecations</hi> for and <hi>Benedictions</hi> on those that he met withal; he had, an <hi>Heart</hi> full of good <hi>Wishes</hi> and a <hi>Mouth</hi> full of kind <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> for them.

               <p>He could not comprehend, that this <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi> can arise from any other <hi>Formal cause,</hi> but the Consent, Concurrence, Confederation of those concerned in it; he looked upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto a Church, as not a <hi>Natural,</hi> or a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent,</hi> but a <hi>Voluntary</hi> thing, and so that it is to be entred no otherwise than by an Holy <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> or, as the Scripture speaks, by <hi>giving our selves first unto the Lord, and then one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> He could not think, that <hi>Baptism</hi> alone was to be accounted the <hi>cause,</hi> but rather the <hi>effect,</hi> of Church-member-ship; inasmuch as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dissolution of the Church to which a man belongs, his <hi>Baptism</hi> would not become a Nullity: nor that meet <hi>Profession</hi> would render men <hi>members</hi> of this or that C<hi>hurch;</hi> for then it would be impossible to cut off a corrupt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from that Body Politic: Nor that meet <hi>Co-habitation</hi> would make <hi>Church-members;</hi> for then the vilest infidels would be actually incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated with us.

                  <q>It is matter (said he) of great Thankfulness, that we have <hi>Christ Confessed</hi> in our Churches, by such as we Receive to full Communion there.

It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an Ordinance of wonderful benefit; the Lord planted many <hi>Vineyards</hi> in the first Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of this Countrey, and there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <hi>Noble Vines</hi> in them; it was their <hi>Heavenly-mindedness</hi> which disposed them to this Exercise, and by the upholding of it, the Churches are still filled with <hi>Noble Vines;</hi> it mightily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains purity of Churches.

               <p>There were especially two things, which he was loth to <hi>see,</hi> and yet fear'd he <hi>saw,</hi> falling in the Churches of <hi>New-England.</hi> One was, A thorough Establishment of <hi>Ruling-Elders</hi> in our Churches; which he thought sufficiently warranted by the Apostles mention of, <hi>Elders that Rule well, who yet labour not in Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> He was very desirous to have prudent and gracious men set over our Churches, for the Assistence of their <hi>Pastors,</hi> in the Church acts that concern the <hi>Admission</hi> and <hi>Exclusion</hi> of Members, and the <hi>Inspection</hi> of the Conversation led by the Communicants, and the <hi>Instruction</hi> of their several Families, and the <hi>Visitation</hi> of the Afflicted in the Flock over which they should preside.

               <p>But the mention of a <hi>Synod</hi> brings to mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, which he was Concerned, that we might never want; and that is, a frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of <hi>Needful Synods</hi> in our Churches. For tho' he had a deep and a due care to preserve the <hi>Rights of particular Churches,</hi> yet he thought all the Churches of the Lord Jesus by their <hi>Union</hi> in what they <hi>profess,</hi> in what they <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,</hi> and in what they <hi>enjoy,</hi> so compacted into one <hi>Body Mystical,</hi> as that all the several <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches</hi> every where should <hi>act</hi> with a regard unto the good of the whole, and unto the common <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Counsil</hi> of the Neighbourhood; which cannot be done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by <hi>Letters missive,</hi> like those that passed between <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> in the early dayes of Christianity; but it requires a Convention of the Churches in <hi>Synods,</hi> by their <hi>Delegates</hi> and <hi>Messengers.</hi> He did not count Churches to be so <hi>Independent,</hi> as that they can always discharge their whole Duty, and yet not act in a conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Neighbour-Churches; nor would he be of any Church that will not acknowledge it self <hi>accountable</hi> to rightly composed <hi>Synods,</hi> which may have occasion to enquire into the

circumstances of it; he saw the main <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Business</hi> of Churches might quickly come to be utterly loft, if <hi>Synods</hi> were not often called for the Repairing of Inconveniences, and he was much in contriving for the regular and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated meeting of <hi>such</hi> Assemblies.</p>
               <p>He wish'd for <hi>Councils</hi> to suppress all dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresies or pernicious Opinions that might ever arise among us; for <hi>Councils</hi> to extinguish all dangerous Divisions, &amp; scandalous Contentions which might ever begin to flame in our Borders; for <hi>Councils</hi> to rectify all Male-Administrations in the midst of us, or to Recover any particular Churches out of any Disorders which they may be plung'd into: for <hi>Councils</hi> to enquire into the Love, the Peace, the Holiness maintained by the several Churches; in fine, for <hi>Councils</hi> to send forth fit <hi>Labourers</hi> into those parts of our Lords <hi>Harvest,</hi> which are without the Gospel of God. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held an Apostolical Precept and Pattern for such <hi>Councils;</hi> and when such <hi>Councils</hi> convened in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, by the consent of several Churches concerned in mutual Communion, have Declared, Explained, Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the mind of God from his word unto us, he reckoned a truth so delivered, challenged an Observation from the particular Churches, with a very great <hi>Authority.</hi>

            <p>THe Titles of a <hi>Christian</hi> and of a <hi>Minister,</hi> have rendred our <hi>Eliot</hi> considerable; but there is one memorable Title more, by which he has been signalized unto us.

            <p>I cannot find that any besides the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, first moved him to the blessed Work of <hi>Evangilizing</hi> these perishing Indians; 'twas that Holy Spirit which laid before his mind the <hi>Ideal</hi> of that which is now on the <hi>Seal</hi> of the Massachuset-Colony; <hi>A poor Indian having a Label going from his mouth, with a,</hi> COME OVER AND HELP US.

All the <hi>Religion</hi> they have amounts unto thus much; they beleive, <hi>that</hi> there are many <hi>Gods,</hi> who made and own the several Nations of the world; of which a certain <hi>Great God</hi> in the South-west Regions of Heaven bears the greatest Figure. They believe, <hi>that</hi> every remarkable Creature has a peculiar <hi>God</hi> within it, or about it: there is with them, a <hi>Sun-God,</hi> a <hi>Moon-god,</hi> and the like; and they cannot conceive but that the <hi>fire</hi> must be a kind of a <hi>God,</hi> inasmuch as a <hi>Spark</hi> of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

will soon produce very strange effects. They believe <hi>that</hi> when any good or ill happens to them, there is the favour or the anger of a <hi>God</hi> expressed in it; and hence as in a time of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity they keep a <hi>Dance,</hi> or a day of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ridiculous Devotions to their God, so in a time of Prosperity they likewise have a <hi>Feast,</hi> wherein they also make presents one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Finally, they beleive, <hi>that</hi> their cheef God <hi>Kautantowit,</hi> made a man and woman of a <hi>Stone;</hi> which, upon dislike, he broke to pieces, and made another man and woman of a <hi>Tree,</hi> which were the Fountains of all Mankind; and, <hi>that</hi> we all have in us immortal <hi>Souls,</hi> which, if we were godly, shall go to a splendid Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Kautantowit,</hi> but otherwise, must wander about in a restless Horror for-ever. But if you say to them any thing of a <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> they will reply upon you, <hi>i shall never believe it!</hi> And when they have any weighty undertaking before them, 'tis an usual thing for them to have their Assemblies, wherein af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the usage of some Diabolical <hi>Rites,</hi> a <hi>Devil</hi> appears unto them, to inform them and advise them about their circumstances; and sometimes there are odd Events of their making these Applications to the <hi>Devil.</hi> For instance, 'tis particularly affirmed, That the Indians in their Wars with us, finding a sore inconvenience by our <hi>Dogs,</hi> which would make a sad yelling if in the Night they scented the approaches of them,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:000568_0089_0FA712B8A34DC010"/>
they sacrificed a <hi>Dog</hi> to the Devil; after which no <hi>English</hi> Dog would bark at an Indian for divers months ensuing. This was the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people, which our <hi>Eliot</hi> propounded unto himself, the saving of! And he had a double work incumbent on him; he was to make <hi>Men</hi> of them, ere he could hope to see them <hi>Saints;</hi> they must be <hi>civilized</hi> er'e they could be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianized;</hi> he could not, as <hi>Gregory</hi> once of our Nation, see any thing <hi>Angelical</hi> to bespeak his Labours for their eternal Welfare; all among them was <hi>Diabolical.</hi> To think on Raising a number of these hideous Creatures, unto the <hi>Elevations</hi> of our Holy Religion, must argue more than common or little Sentiments in the Undertaker; but the Faith of an <hi>Eliot</hi> could encounter it!</p>
            <p>I confess, there was one, I cannot call it so much <hi>guess</hi> as <hi>wish,</hi> wherein he was willing a little to indulge himself; and that was, <hi>That our</hi> Indians <hi>are the posterity of the dispersed and rejected</hi> Israelites, <hi>concerning</hi> whom our God has promised that they shall yet <hi>be saved, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer coming to turn away ungodliness from them</hi> He saw the <hi>Indians</hi> using many <hi>Parables</hi> in their Discourses; much given to Anointing of their <hi>Heads;</hi> much delighted in <hi>Dancing,</hi> especially after Victories; computing their Times by <hi>Nights</hi> and <hi>Months;</hi> giving <hi>Dowries</hi> for Wives and causing their Women to <hi>dwell by themselves</hi> at certain seasons, for secret causes; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customing

            <p>The <hi>First step</hi> which he judg'd Necessary now to be taken by him, was to learn the <hi>Indian</hi>-language; for he saw them so stupid and senseless, that they would never do so much as enquire after the Religion of the strangers now come into their Country, much less would they so far imitate us as to leave off their beastly way of living, that they might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of any Spiritual Advantage by us: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we could first address them in a <hi>Language</hi> of their own.

All the Congregations <hi>(h)</hi> of the Converted <hi>Indians</hi> (both the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens</hi> and those in Church Order) every Lords-day meet together; the pastor or Preacher always begins with Prayer, and <hi>without a Form, because from the Heart;</hi> when the Ruler of the Assembly has ended Prayer, the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Indians</hi> Praise God with singing; some of them are excellent Singers: After the Psalm, he that Preaches reads a place of Scripture (one or more verses as he will) and expounds it, gathers Doctrines from it proves them by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Reasons, and infers uses from them after the manner of the <hi>English,</hi> of whom have been taught; then another prayer to God in the Name of Christ concludes the whole Service.

every Lords-day. They observe no <hi>Holy days</hi> but the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> except upon some extraordinary occasion; and then they solemnly set apart whole days, either in giving Thanks or Fasting and Praying with great fervour of mind.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>English</hi> came into these Coasts these barbarous Nations were altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true God; hence it is that in their Prayers and Sermons they use <hi>English</hi> Words and Terms; he that calls upon the most Holy Name of God, says, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God, or <hi>Lord,</hi> and also they have learned and borrowed many other Theological Phrases from us</p>

            <p>It was his wisdom that he began with them upon such principles, as they themselves had already some Notions of; such as that of an <hi>Heaven</hi> for good, and <hi>Hell</hi> for bad people, when they <hi>Dy'd.</hi> It broke his gracious heart within him to see, what Floods of Tears fell from the Eyes of several among these Degenerate Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, at the first Addresses which he made unto them; yea, form the very worst of them all.

            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> that had felt the Impressions of his Ministry, were quickly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the Name of, <hi>Praying Indians;</hi> and these <hi>Praying Indians</hi> as quickly were for a more Decent and English way of Living, and they desired a more Fixed <hi>Cohabitation.</hi> At se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places did they now combine and settle; But the place of Greatest Name among their Towns, is that of <hi>Natick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here 'twas, that in the year 1651. those that had heretofore lived like the <hi>wild Beasts</hi> in the Wilderness, now compacted themselves into a Town; and they first apply'd themselves to the forming of their <hi>Civil Government.</hi> Our <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Court,</hi> not withstanding their exact study to keep these Indians very sensible of their being subject unto the English Empire, yet had allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them their smaller Courts, wherein they might govern their own smaller Cases and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, after their own particular Modes, and might have their <hi>Town-Orders,</hi> if I may call them so, peculiar to themselves. With respect hereunto, Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> on a Solemn <hi>Fast</hi> made a publick <hi>Von, That seeing these Indians were not Prepossessed with any Forms of Government, he would with not them into such a Form, as we had written

in the Word of God, that so they might be a people in all things ruled by the Lord.</hi> Accordingly, he Expounded unto them the eighteenth Chapter of <hi>Exodus;</hi> and then they chose Rulers of <hi>Hundreds,</hi> of <hi>Fifties,</hi> of <hi>Tens;</hi> and therewithal Entred into this Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We are the sons of <hi>Adam;</hi> We and our Forefathers have a long time been Lost in our sins; but now the mercy of the Lord begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to find us out again; therefore the grace of Christ helping us, we do give our-selves and our Children, unto God, to be his people.

Oh Jehovah, Teach us Wisdome; send thy Spirit into our hearts; take us to be thy people, and lett us take thee to be our God.</q>

            <p>Such an opinion about the perfection of the Scripture had he, that he thus expressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon this occasion, <hi>God will being Nations into Distress and perpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

against <hi>Fornication, Drunkenness,</hi> and <hi>Sabbath, breaking,</hi> and other Immoralities; and they next began to <hi>Lament</hi> after the Establishment of a <hi>Church-order</hi> among them, and after the several Ordinances and Priviledges of a <hi>Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> The Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> have usually been very strict, in their Admissions to <hi>Church-Fellowship,</hi> and required very signal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of a <hi>Repenting</hi> and a <hi>Believing</hi> Soul, before they thought men fit subjects to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with, <hi>The Rights of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But the seemed rather to Augment than Abate their usual <hi>Strictness,</hi> when the examination of the <hi>Indians</hi> was to be performed.

from their mouths by able Interpreters, were scanned by the people of God, and found much Acceptance with them.</p>
            <p>I need pass no further Censure upon them, than what is given by my Grand-father, she well-known <hi>Richard Mather,</hi> in an Epistle of his, Published on this occasion; says he, <q>There is so much of Gods work among them, as that I cannot but count it a great evil, yea a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to God and His Goodness, for any to make light of it.

And tho they spoke in a Language, of which many of us understood but little, yet <hi>we</hi> that were present that day, <hi>we</hi> saw and heard them penform the Duties mentioned with such grave and sober Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, with such comely Reverence in their Gesture, and their whole carriage, and with such plenty of Tears trickling down the Cheeks of some of them, as did argue to us that they spake with the Holy Fear of God, and it much affected our Hearts.</q>

            <p>Sometimes the more immediate Hand of God, by cutting off the principal Opposers of the Gospel among the Indians made way for Mr. <hi>Eliot'</hi>s Ministry.

            <p>THe same spirit which acted Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> quickly inspired others elsewhere, to prosecute the work of rescuing the poor Indians out of their worse than <hi>Egyptian</hi>-Darkness, in which <hi>Evil Angels</hi> had been so long preying upon them. One of these was the Godly and Gracious <hi>Richard Bourn,</hi> who soon saw a great effect of his Holy Labours. In the 1666. Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by the Honourable Governour, and several Magistrates and Ministers of <hi>Plymouth</hi>-Colony, procured a vast Assembly at <hi>Mashippaug;</hi> and there a good number of Indians, made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions touching the <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>belief,</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> of their Souls, with such understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and affection as was extreamly grateful to the pious Auditory. Yet such was the strictness of the good people in this Affair, that before they would countenance the advancement of <hi>these Indians</hi> unto <hi>Church-Fellowship,</hi> they orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Confessions to be written and sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Churches in the Colony, for their Approbation; but so approv'd they were, that afterwards, the Messengers of all the Churches giving their <hi>Presence</hi> and <hi>consent,</hi> they became a Church, and chose Mr. <hi>Bourn</hi> to be their Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; who was then by Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>

Ordain'd unto that Office over them. From hence Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> went over to an Island called <hi>Martha'</hi>s <hi>Vineyard,</hi> where God had so succeeded the honest Labours of some, &amp; particularly of the <hi>Mayhew'</hi>s as that a Church was gathered.</p>
            <p>This Church, after <hi>Fasting and Prayer,</hi> chose one <hi>Hiacoomes</hi> to be their Pastor, <hi>John Tockinosh,</hi> an able and a discreet Christian to be their Teacher; <hi>Joshua Mummeecheegs</hi> and <hi>John Nanaso</hi> to be ruling Elders; and these were then Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> thereunto. Distance of Habitation, caused this one Church by mutual agreement afterwards to become <hi>two;</hi> the Pastor and one Ruling Elder taking one part, &amp; the Teacher &amp; one Ruling Elder, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; at <hi>Nantucket</hi> another adjacent Island was another Church of Indians quickly gathered, who chose an Indian, <hi>John Gibs</hi> to be their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.

               <p>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> Sacrificed, and so Worshipped. This was the manner of old time. But what <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> have we <hi>now</hi> to offer? I shall answer by that in Psal. 4. 5. <hi>Offer to God the Sacrifice of Righteousness, and put your Trust in the Lord.</hi> These are the true Spiritual <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which God requireth at <hi>our</hi> hands; the <hi>Sacrifices of Righteousness;</hi> that is, we must look to our hearts and ways, that-they be <hi>Righteous;</hi> and then we shall be acceptable to God when we Worship <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Again, We are <hi>to put our Trust in the Lord.</hi> Who else is there for us to trust in? We must believe in the Word of God; if we doubt of God, or doubt of his Word, our <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are little worth; but if we <hi>trust</hi> stedfastly in God, our <hi>Sacrifices</hi> will be good.</p>
               <p>Once more, what <hi>Sacrifices</hi> must me offer? My Answer is, we must offer such as <hi>Abraham</hi> offered And what a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was that? we are told in Gen- 22. 12. <hi>Now I know that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

dearly beloved, <hi>Son,</hi> and he offered that <hi>Son</hi> to God; and so God said, <hi>I know thou fearest me!</hi> Behold, a Sacrifice in Dead and in Truth! such an one must <hi>we</hi> offer. Only, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not us to Sacrifice our <hi>Sons,</hi> but our <hi>sins;</hi> our dearest <hi>Sins.</hi> God calls us this day to part with all our <hi>Sins,</hi> tho' never so beloved; and we must not with-hold any of them from him.

                  <hi>God smelt a sweet favour in</hi> Noahs <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and so will God receive our Sacrifices, when we Worship him aright. But how did God manifest, his Acceptance of <hi>Noahs</hi> Offering: 'twas by promising to <hi>Drown</hi> the world no more, but give us <hi>Fruitful Seasons.</hi> God has chastised us of late, as if he would utterly <hi>Drown</hi> us; and he has <hi>Drowned</hi> and Spoiled and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd a great deal of our hay, and threatens, to kill our Cattel. 'Tis for this that we <hi>Fast</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> this Day.

            <head>(I) A Comparison between what the New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glanders have done for the Conversion of the Indians, and what has been done elsewhere by the Roman Catholicks.</head>
            <p>IT is to be confessed, That the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> have a <hi>Clergy</hi> so very Numerous, and so little Encumbred, and are Masters of such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Ecclesiastical <hi>Revenues,</hi> as renders it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easy for them to exceed the <hi>Protestants</hi> In their Endeavours to Christianize the Pagan Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages. Nor would I <hi>Reproach,</hi> but rather <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud</hi> their <hi>Industry</hi> in this matter, wishing that we were all touched with an <hi>Emulation</hi> of it.
