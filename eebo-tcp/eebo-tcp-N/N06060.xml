            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THOUGH War be in its Nature and Tendency, a ſore Calamity, and natural Fruit of Man's primitive Rebellion againſt his glorious Creator; and the juſt and holy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of the Univerſe, be in this Way bearing Teſtimony againſt the crying Sins and Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Land, and ſhewing his juſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt an ungrateful and rebellious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Yet, adored he his great Goodneſs, he is intermixing much Mercy with his Judgments; in that he ſtill continues to ſend his Meſſengers to invite us to Repentance; that ſo, in this Way, our final Ruin may be prevented.—Particularly—</p>
            <p>It muſt be looked upon as a real Smile and ſignal Favour of Heaven upon our military En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, that divine Providence calls and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, one and another of his faithful Servants in the Miniſtry, to go forth with, and become Teachers of our Army: Such a one I look upon the Author of the following ſuitable and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe to be; through which he breathes forth Love to his glorious Maſter, and his deareſt Intereſt; as well as a Heart diſpoſed to comply with the Call of Providence, and follow the Lamb whereſoever he leads, as one entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to his Lord's Will.—May Almighty GOD faſten deep theſe parting Counſels, on the Hearts of his dear People; keep them, feed

                  <p>And they all wept ſore, and fell upon <hi>Paul</hi>'s Neck, and kiſſed him: Sorrowing moſt of all for the Words which he ſpake, that they ſhould ſee his Face no more. And they accompanied him to the Ship.—</p>

            <p>SUCH is the State of this World wherein we dwell, and ſuch the Nature of Things here, that we can find nothing certain or permanent, but all Things in a conſtant Fluctuation, and we are preſented with a Scene of uninterrupted Change. —What Being then, endued with rational Powers, and acting like itſelf, can chuſe his Portion here, or vainly expect Happineſs in the Fruition of ſuch changing and uncertain Trifles, as all the Creatures of Time, and Objects of Senſe are?—As we find a conſtant Viciſſitude, every Good in the Creature muſt neceſſarily be uncertain; ſo that what we call our Property To-day, may be in the Poſſeſſion of another To-morrow; and what we have raiſed Expectations of enjoying, may never be ours. The Events of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Moment we ſee, but who can tell what will happen the next? All before us is dark and unknown, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what is diſcovered by divine Revelation, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Promiſe of eternal Truth.—No
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007695_0005_102D9AFFF46E5530"/>
Wonder then, that ſuch as diſcard Revelation, not only become Sceptics, but fully commence a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Atheiſts, in the Iſſue.—We may look back and view thoſe changing Scenes of an all-wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that we have paſs'd through; Peace and War, Sickneſs and Health, Adverſity and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſet the one over againſt the other: But if we look forward to a Space of Futurity, equal to that of our paſt Lives, who can ſay what ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen? Shall not moſt, or all of us, be in the eternal World, where we ſhall ſee no more Changes? Bleſſed ſurely, and happy is he, that watcheth and keepeth his Garments.—</p>
            <p>Friendſhip is one of the ſtricteſt Bonds, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Enjoyments of human Nature; yet by Reaſon of the changeable State of Things, this alſo is Vanity, and a Preparatory to Sorrow; for deareſt Friends muſt part, and the ſtrongeſt Ties of Nature be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; the moſt kind and generous Benefactor, the moſt pleaſant, obliging and agreeable Companion, the moſt ſure and faithful Friend, muſt be removed; <hi>Lover and Friend will be put far from us, and our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance into Darkneſs,</hi> Pſal. 88, 18.</p>
            <p>It is a moſt amiable, as well as eſſential Property of the Chriſtian Religion, that it diſpoſes to Love and Kindneſs. Benevolence truly ſo called, and brotherly Love are peculiar to the real Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus-Chriſt.</hi> Though from Conſtitution, or what is called, natural Temper, ſome may appear to be more amicable, kind and obliging, than others; yet that gracious Diſpoſition, which the Goſpel calls brotherly Love, has ſomething truly divine, in its Nature; and is ſpecifically different from any Thing that meer Nature does, or can produce, in fallen and depraved Humanity; there is ſomething from Heaven rendered viſible in the Object, which ſuitably influences the Subject: The divine Image, or Reſemblance of God's
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007695_0006_102D9B0323711308"/>
moral Perfections in the Former, and an agreeable Temper, or Reliſh for moral Beauty in the Latter, whence Love ariſes in the Subject towards its Objects, from proper and genuine Motives.—</p>
            <p>The Felicity of the heavenly State conſiſts in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love, Freedom from Sin, and the full immediate Fruition of the ever-bleſſed God, who is the Sum and Comprehenſion, of all Glory, Excellency, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Bleſſedneſs; and juſt ſo far as we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to love God here, and one another, upon the ſame Grounds, and from the ſame Motives, as the bleſſed, and perfectly holy Inhabitants of the World of Glory, love God and one another; juſt ſo far are we real Chriſtians, and no farther. Such a divine Temper as this, ſuch a Reliſh for moral Excellency, in the real undiſſembled Diſciples of our bleſſed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, was the Source of all that Grief which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed their Hearts, and Spring of thoſe Rivers of Tears, which flowed from their Eyes, at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Paul, their ſpiritual Father, the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>—</p>
            <p>In the Words of our Text, the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that it was not meerly the Apoſtle's Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a Seaſon, that ſo deeply affected their Hearts, but it was this Expreſſion of his, <hi>That they ſhould ſee his Face no more,</hi> which pierced them to the very Center of their Souls.—The bleſſed Apoſtle went up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> expecting Perſecution, and his Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation met with no Diſappointment; hence the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples greatly fear'd, or rather reaſonably concluded, that they ſhould ſee his Face no more. Now the dark and gloomy Moment was come, wherein they muſt be, in all Probability, for ever deprived of ſo eminent an Inſtrument of their Comfort and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but eſpecially, that by his Departure, they ſhould loſe ſuch a bright Reſemblance of God's moral Perfections, and ſhining Example of every Chriſtian Grace and Virtue, which had in it the Force and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007695_0007_102D9B04D5E3D220"/>
Power of all other Motives, to excite them to Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This, ah! This, was what did rend their Hearts with Grief, and filled their Eyes with Tears.</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole, theſe Words teach us the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing mutual Love of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples, one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another; and eſpecially to their ſpiritual Guides and Teachers: Yet that there is no Relation, in Life, ſo near and dear, but muſt be diſſolved, and a dark de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Hour muſt come; and ſuch is the imperfect State of the moſt ſanctify'd Chriſtian in this Life, that it would be next Door to impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude every Degree of unſuitable Dependence on Miniſters, or inordinate Affections towards them; and no Doubt at Paul's Departure, there was ſome Exceſs, in the Diſciples Mourning.—</p>
            <p>From the Words, in this View of them, we may infer theſe three Propoſitions, as the Subject of the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That there is a very peculiar Love and Affection that ſubſiſts between the true Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That the deareſt Chriſtian Friends ſhould ſo live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and conduct towards one another, as that when they are called to a Seperation, they may depart in Peace.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Love ſo much enters into both the Character and Temper of the true Chriſtian, that the divine Author of this holy Religion makes it the Criterion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and diſcriminating Badge of his guileleſs Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.

How often does he repeat it! How preſſingly inſiſt upon it! And with what powerful Motives does he inculcate it upon the Minds of his Diſciples! <hi>John</hi> xiii, 12.xv, 34.—And how full are the Apoſtolick Writings of the moſt cogent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Incentives to this God-like Principle! 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.9. <hi>But as touching brotherly Love, ye need not that I write unto you, for ye yourſelves are taught of GOD, to love one another.—Let brotherly Love continue—above all Things have fervent Charity.—If we have not Charity, we are Nothing.</hi>—</p>
            <p>One great Deſign of the Goſpel, is, to train Men up, meeten, and qualify them for the Fruitions and Employments of the heavenly State; to beget in them a Reliſh for, and a Temper ſuited to that Kind of Felicity, that Heaven conſiſts in; which is perfect Love, eternal Peace, and univerſal Harmony. No contrary Intereſts, no jarring Luſts, no unruly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or inordinate Affections, ſhall ever enter or ſubſiſt there; but perfect Love will for ever reign.—</p>
            <p>This divine Propenſity is the firſt Principle of all holy living, the very Root of all Conformity to the preceptive Will of God. Our bleſſed Saviour, who <hi>ſpake as never Man ſpake;</hi> and <hi>taught as One having Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> plainly declares, that Love to God and our Neighbour, are the two grand Topicks, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Commands, in which all, both the Law and the Prophets, are comprehended: And the Apoſtle makes Love, as it were, the Comprehenſion of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; when he ſays, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Nor is there any Thing, wherein the Chriſtian can more reſemble the bleſſed God, than in This. Hence he ſays, <hi>He that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, for God is Love.</hi> Love, therefore, is that divine Principle which ſovereign Grace implants in the Soul. The Face

of Things veil'd with any Degree of Darkneſs, may be brightened and illuſtrated by their Oppoſites, and judged by their Contraries: So here,—If we find a malevolent Temper, or Ill-Will towards our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Fellow-Men, eſpecially if it ariſes from thoſe very Motives on which we ought to love them; it is a ſad Sign that we are deſtitute of a gracious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Heart.—All Malice, Strife, Envy and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, are diametrically oppoſite to the true Temper of a real Chriſtian. It is the peculiar Property of the Chriſtian, to have <hi>the ſame Mind,</hi> Temper or Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>in him, which was in</hi> Jeſus-Chriſt. <hi>He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> like minded with <hi>Chriſt; that is,</hi> he loves what <hi>Chriſt</hi> loves, and hates what <hi>Chriſt</hi> hates; upon the ſame Motives. He that is begotten of GOD, and ſo is made truly gracious; ſo far as he is renewed and ſanctified, reſembles his heavenly Father; and in nothing more than in Love. All <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples are in Love with, and bear a Reſemblance of the ſame infinitely amiable Object; therefore it is the Image of God, which the Saint ſees in his Brother; which is the Ground of his brotherly Love and Chriſtian Charity. <hi>He that loveth Him who begets, loveth Him alſo, who is begotten of Him</hi>; and that, on the Account of theſe amiable Qualities, wherein he ſees him to reſemble his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father: The divine Image diſcern'd in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, muſt, and cannot but attract every Heart that loves GOD ſupremely. The ſame Reaſons hold for our Love to the Brethren, as for our Love to GOD; though not in the ſame Degree: GOD is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, and abſolutely amiable in himſelf; and the Saint is derivatively amiable, and therefore to be loved; not for himſelf, but for his Father's Sake, and in Proportion to that Degree of Likeneſs he bears to him.—by the Way—</p>
            <p>Hence we may ſee, how much it concerns ſuch as would be eſteemed as Saints, and held in Charity; to act out and exhibit a divine Temper in all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.

            <p>How can it be but that ſuch an endearing tender Love, ſhould ſubſiſt among all <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples, one towards another; ſeeing they are Children of the ſame Father, Branches of the ſame Family, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Body, fighting under the ſame glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Captain, all engaged in the ſame Intereſt, fed at the ſame Table, led by the ſame Spirit, initiated into the ſame Priviledges, travelling in the ſame Way, running the ſame Race, and Heirs of the ſame Inheritance; nay enrolled Citizens of the ſame new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they all hope, ere long, to meet in one great and general Aſſembly, to take Poſſeſſion, each for himſelf, of a Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, dwell for ever together in Fulneſs of Joy, bow before the Throne, and with all their Hearts and Tongues join in one eternal Song of Praiſe: Aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory and Honour, Thanksgiving, and Bleſſing to God, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.—</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:007695_0011_102D9B0E0D24D288"/>1. That divine Providence may call Them to part, tho' they be continued in Life, and ſo in a State of Probation. This is ſo much our own preſent Caſe, that no other Inſtance need be introduced for Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I am by an all-diſpoſing Providence, called, ſo far as I am capable of judging in the Caſe, to part with my reverend and greatly eſteemed Brethren, my beloved People and dear Family; and were it not that I fear leſt I ſhould be found to counteract infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom in it's providential Conduct; my ſtrong Affections to Thoſe I leave behind, in the various Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Life, muſt have preponderated all other Reaſons, determined my Continuance, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my preſent Deſign. The Scene, which is juſt now opening to me, and the Province I am ready to enter upon, I can moſt freely ſay is what I never have either coveted or ſought after; and as I have not, my dear People, look'd upon your generous and ſelf-denying Conſent to my leaving you, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſerve the publick Intereſt, as any Argument at all of your Want of ſuitable Affections to your Miniſter; but as the genuine Fruit of a truly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and publick Spirit; ſo I hope you will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain my Departure (with your own manifeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) as ariſing from any Want of Love to you, or of real and tender Regard for your Good; for it is the common Cauſe that I am ſtill going to plead, and (as far as I ſhall thro' Grace be enabled) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.—As I do not entertain the leaſt Doubt of your Affections towards me, even far beyond my Deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo I am very conſcious of my own tender Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to you, and hearty Concern for your Proſperity and Welfare in all your Intereſts. Yet how cloſely ſoever we may be knit together in Affection; we muſt part, at leaſt for a Seaſon.—None can ſo well tell, how dear a People are to a faithful Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he himſelf; nor indeed can he ſo well judge of this, as when he is called to part with them: But be the

They will not awaken one ſtupid ſecure Sinner, or ſo much as reſtrain from the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of one Sin; far leſs will they change the Heart of Stone into an Heart of Fleſh, or alter the moral Temper and Diſpoſition of the Soul, without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſing, or the immediate and powerful Agency of the Holy Ghoſt.

I have never taught you that the Law is abated in Proportion as we have loſt our Power; nor have I ever endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gain you over to that God-contemning deiſtical Conceit, that the great God has made the Creature his laſt End, and regards not the Honour and Glory of his adorable Perfections, by far ſo much as he does the Creature's Happineſs; or that no Afflictions or Sufferings are of a penal Nature, but merely correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and purgatorial; and that Such as are obſtinate, and will not be reclaimed here, ſhall, when they die, commence a new State of Probation under more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Diſcipline, until they are brought to a right Temper of Mind, and ſo in the final Reſult all rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Nature ſhall be happy; and herein the ultimate End of the great Creator be fully attained.—All ſuch Stuff, I now take an Opportunity, to bear publick Teſtimony againſt as damnable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt dangerous Hereſy.

But what Effect my Counſels and Warnings have generally had upon Old and Young, I know not; and now perhaps this may be the Caſe, that <hi>Ye ſhall ſee my Face no more:</hi> Let me therefore, fill up our parting Interview with what a beloved Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may juſtly expect from a faithful Steward in the Houſe of God.—Suffer me then, briefly to hint to you the Sins that are moſt prevalent amongſt us, and call loudly for Repentance and Reformation: And finiſh with my beſt Counſel and Advice to you.—

Time will not allow me either to make a methodical Arrangement of common Vices, or open up their Nature and Aggravations; but are not theſe provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evils found amongſt us? Great Contempt of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Grace; Profanation of the Lord's Day; miſpenſe of precious Time; awful Security in Sin, and under Judgments; Neglect of Worſhip, Inſtructions and Government in Families; as well as great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Carele<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>eſs reſpecting publick Worſhip and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; a great Want of brotherly Love, whence ariſe Backbitings, Slanderings, letigious Law-Suits, and unchriſtian Contentions of divers Kinds; Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Chambering and Wantonneſs, Rioting and Drunkenneſs, Pride and Covetouſneſs; with ſundry more that might be named.—My parting Advice therefore, to Old and Young, is to reform and repent of all theſe Abominations; and O! Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, yea even dread a Continuance in a carnal, Chriſtleſs and unrenewed Eſtate.—Bend your Minds to the Things of another World, and labour to keep this World under your Feet.—Get into <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and make thorough Work of Religion; earneſtly cry to the Father of Lights to give you a ſaving Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his dear Son, and an Heart to love Him ſupremely, and one another fervently.—Be conſtant and importunate in ſecret Devotions; give Way to no Temptations; bear hard againſt every Sin.— Maintain religious Conferences, and Seaſons of Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſearch the Scriptures daily; ſtudy the Things that make for Peace, and whereby you may edify one another.—I earneſtly beſpeak your ſervent Prayers to God for me, that I may be faithful to the Truſt repoſed in me, preſerved amidſt all Dangers, and by the Will of God have a ſafe and joyful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto you.—If this is my final Remove,—Let me beſeech you; beware of every One who would bring you <hi>another Goſpel than you have received</hi>; even tho' <hi>it were an Angel from Heaven</hi> receive him not, hear him not, neither bid him <hi>Godſpeed:</hi> But if you

have any Regard to the Intereſt of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> any Love to your own Souls, and the Souls of your dear Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeek One to ſucceed me, who gives all proper Evidence both in Conduct and Preaching, that he has ſaving Acquaintance with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the great Subject of Goſpel-Preaching, and the Life of God in his own Soul. Never, ah! never, my dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, knowingly commit the Guidance of your Souls, and the Souls of Your's to the Blind. I had much rather, you ſhould ſpend the Lord's Day in Prayer, in Reading and Hearing ſound practical and experimental Diſcourſes, that have been publiſhed by godly Divines, than in a cold, formal Round of faſhionable Declamations from this Deſk.—O may a merciful God forbid, this ſhould ever be your ſad Caſe. And ſhould You and I never meet any more, till we meet in the eternal World, let this laſt Advice of a departed Friend abide upon your Minds.— <hi>Finally Brethren I commend you to God and to the Word of his Grace.—Beware leſt after my Departure grievous Wolves enter in among you, not ſparing, but rending and devouring the Flock. And leſt even from among Yourſelves Men ſhould ariſe ſpeaking perverſe Things to draw away Diſciples after them.</hi>—Be perfect, be of <hi>one Mind; live in Love and Peace. And may the God of Peace dwell with you.</hi> To the Youth, ye dear Lambs of this Fold! as I have often heretofore, ſo I now, once more, and perhaps once for all, beſeech you to <hi>flee all youthful Luſts</hi>; betake Yourſelves to a ſerious and religious Life; learn to pray and live to God. If your Parents are faithful you will hear many good Counſels, and improving Inſtructions, as well as be under the daily Influence of pious Examples, beſure hearken to the One, and imitate the Other, and herein comply with the Advice you have repeatedly had from this Deſk; and if I ſhould ſee your Faces no more in this World, let me find none of you, among that wretched Crew on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s left Hand at the laſt Day, leſt all the Pains taken with you, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007695_0022_102D9B29EFF33908"/>
Priviledges enjoy'd by you, enhance your Guilt, and then aggravate your Miſery; and I, who am now your compaſſionate Counſellor, be then a ſwift Witneſs againſt you. But purſue Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ye may be found in Him, and we may rejoice together; that when I ſhall be called for, I may with Pleaſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Lord here am I and the Children which thou haſt given me.</hi>—Which God of his infinite Mercy grant, thro' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to whom be Honour and Glory for ever.
