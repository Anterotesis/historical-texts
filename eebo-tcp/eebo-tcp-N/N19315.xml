            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE life of Dr. WATTS is more inſtructive from the brightneſs of his example than enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining from any variety of incidents. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is partly owing to the nature of his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; partly to a long continued infirmity of body, which obliged him to live retired from the world, and partly to a reſolution which he had taken not to leave behind him any memorials from which a narrative of his life might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled. It was his choice that his character might
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025154_0004_0FCE726B37230550"/>
appear from his <hi>printed</hi> works, and not from any private papers. His friends, to whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the care of publiſhing his books, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly prohibited from making a collection of his letters, which might eaſily have been done ſoon after his death.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The propriety of this prohibition is evidenced by a collection of his <hi>letters</hi> publiſhed in 1779, with other poſthumous works; which, in the opinion of the Monthly Reviewers, "ought rather to have been committed to the flames than ſent to the preſs."</p>
                  <p>Many of them related to a controverſy between him and Mr. THOMAS BRADBURY, a diſſenting miniſter in London. Bradbury was a man of wit and ſpleen. In his merry moments he would laugh at ſome of Watts's hymns; and in his ſplenetic and zealous hours would abuſe his principles and call in queſtion his orthodoxy. Watts acknowledged the ſprightlineſs of his antagoniſt, but thought his wit vain and licentious, and called in queſtion his veracity It was a mere perſonal quarrel of no conſequence to the public.</p>
                  <bibl>Mon. Review, 1779. p. 431.</bibl>
               </note> The materials from which any account of his life can be compoſed are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore few; they exhibit a vigorous mind in a weak body; a character amiable and worthy of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>He was born at Southampton on the 17th of July, 1674, and was the eldeſt of nine children. His father ISAAC WATTS, was a man of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable learning, and was keeper of a boarding ſchool. His parents were eminent for religion, and were ſufferers for conſcience ſake in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution raiſed againſt the nonconformiſts by CHARLES II.</p>
            <p>The uncommon genius of their ſon appeared early. He began to learn Latin at four years old; and made a ſwift progreſs in that and the Greek language, under the care of Mr. PIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HORNE, a clergyman of the eſtabliſhed church, and maſter of the free ſchool at Southampton, to whom the gratitude of his ſcholar afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025154_0005_0FCE723CCF7CF358"/>
a Latin ode. It was written at the age of twenty, and is inſerted among his Lyric Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems.</p>
            <p>He was ſoon taken notice of for the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his wit, as well as for his proficiency in his ſtudies, and a ſubſcription was propoſed for his education at one of the univerſities. But his inclination to take his lot with the diſſenters made him decline this offer; and in the year 1690, at the age of ſixteen, he was ſent to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for academical education, under the care of the Rev. THOMAS ROWE, to whom alſo, he has inſcribed an ode among his Lyric verſes. Some Latin eſſays, ſuppoſed to have been written as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes at this academy, ſhow a degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both philoſophical and theological, to which very few perſons attain by a much longer courſe of ſtudy.</p>
            <p>He was, as he hints in his miſcellanies, a maker of verſes from the age of fifteen to fifty, and in his youth he gave attention to Latin po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry. His verſes to his brother in the <hi>glyconic</hi> meaſure, written at ſeventeen, are remarkably eaſy and elegant. Some of his other odes are deformed by the <hi>Pindaric</hi> folly then prevailing, and are written with ſuch negligence of all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical rules as is without example among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; but his diction, though not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly pure, has ſuch copiouſneſs and ſplendor as ſhows that he was not far from excellence.</p>
            <p>His method of ſtudy was ſometimes to impreſs the contents of books upon his memory by abridging them; at other times to write remarks in the margin and blank leaves; to ſtate his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025154_0006_0FCE726F9C86C7B8"/>
to what he thought exceptionable; to illuſtrate and confirm what appeared juſt, and to inſert his opinion of the whole performance. This method he has recommended to ſtudents in his book of the Improvement of the Mind.</p>
            <p>Having an early impreſſion of the truth and importance of religion on his mind, he was guarded againſt the follies of youth; his conduct whilſt at the academy, was not only ſo inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that his tutor declared he never once had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to reprove him; but it was ſo exemplary as to be frequently propoſed to the other ſtudents for their imitation. Among theſe were JOHN HUGHES, the poet, Dr. JOSIAH HORT, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards archbiſhop of Tuam in Ireland, to whom one of his Lyric pieces is inſcribed, and SAMUEL SAY, a diſſenting clergyman of Weſtminſter, whoſe poems were publiſhed by DUNCOMBE.</p>
            <p>In his nineteenth year (1693) he joined in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the church, of which his tutor was the worthy paſtor. The next year, having fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed his academical courſe, he returned to his father's houſe at Southampton; where he ſpent two years more in ſtudy and devotion, preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his entering on the work of the goſpel min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, to which he was determined to devote his life; and of the importance of which he had a deep ſenſe on his mind. His father treated him with the greateſt tenderneſs, and had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of living to ſee him eminent for literature, and venerable for piety and uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>In 1696 he was invited by the learned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sir JOHN HARTOPP to reſide in his family as a tutor to his ſon. Here he continued four
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025154_0007_0FCE723E8A957900"/>
years, and his behaviour was ſo engaging as to win the affections of the family, and lay a found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for that intimate friendſhip which ſubſiſted between him and his pupil to the day of his death. To this gentleman he dedicated two of his Lyric odes, in one of which he recommends <hi>early riſing,</hi> as a neceſſary means of diligence and uſefulneſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>Whilſt he aſſiſted the ſtudies of his pupil he did not neglect his own; but beſides thoſe branches of ſcience in which he inſtructed him, he diligently ſtudied the ſcriptures in the origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al languages, and the beſt commentators ancient and modern.</p>
            <p>He began to preach on the day which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted the twenty-fourth year of his age (1698) and in the ſame year he was choſen aſſiſtant to Dr. ISAAC CHAUNCY,<note n="†" place="bottom">He was ſon of CHARLES CHAUNCY, Preſident of Harvard College in New-England, where he received his education, and grandfather of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

His public labors met with general acceptance; but were ſoon after interrupted by a threatening ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of five months continuance, which was brought on him by his cloſe application to ſtudy, and his fervor in preaching. This however did not diſcourage him from returning to his work as ſoon as his health was reſtored.</p>
            <p>In January 1701, he received a Call from that church to ſucceed Dr. Chauncy in the paſtoral
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025154_0008_0FCE7271E3C89560"/>
office, of which he ſignified his acceptance on the day that King WILLIAM died. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is particularly noted by Dr. JEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NINGS as an act of chriſtian heroiſm, becauſe of the diſcouraging proſpect which that event gave to men of his profeſſion, and the fears with which it filled the hearts of proteſtant diſſenters at that time, when toleration was ſo inſecurely eſtabliſhed that the exiſtence of it depended on mere caſualty. But he had "ſet his hand to the plough, and would not look back." Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he was ordained on the 18th of March, 1702.</p>
            <p>The joy of his church in their happy ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſoon clouded by a ſecond ſevere illneſs which laid him by for ſometime, and from which he recovered by ſlow degrees. This made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his church to provide an aſſiſtant, and Mr SAMUEL PRICE <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>Though relieved in part of his public labours, his health remained very fluctuating and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for ſeveral years; but as it returned he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his diligence in fulfilling his miniſtry. His congregation was edified by his public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and by his entertaining and profitable converſation in his private viſits. This was a ſeaſon of the beſt health which he ever enjoyed, and during this time he formed a private ſoicety of the younger perſons in his congregation, to which he delivered the ſubſtance of that excellent book which he afterward publiſhed under the title of "A Guide to Prayer."</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:025154_0009_0FCE723FAB1E6808"/>That the utmoſt harmony and affection ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between him and his congregation appears from his own words in the dedication of the firſt volume of his ſermons to them. "I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it, with the greateſt ſincerity, that there is no place, nor company, nor employment, on this ſide heaven, which can give me ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of delight, as when I ſtand miniſtring holy things in the midſt of you." "Your forward kindneſs hath always forbidden my requeſts, nor do I remember that you ever gave me leave to aſk any think for myſelf at your hands, by your conſtant anticipation of all that I could reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſire."</p>
            <p>In the pulpit, though his low ſtature, which very little exceeded five feet, gave him no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of appearance, yet the gravity and propriety of his utterance rendered his diſcourſes ſolemn and affecting. Dr. JOHNSON has ſaid that he once mentioned the reputation which "modeſt FOSTER" had gained by his proper delivery, to his friend HAWKESWORTH, who told him that in the art of pronunciation he was far inferior to Dr. WATTS. Mr. PALMER, in his notes on Johnſon, queſtions the juſtice of this aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Such was his flow of thought, and ſuch the promptitude of his language, that in his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſtage of life, he did not pre-compoſe his common ſermons; but having adjuſted the heads, and ſketched out ſome particulars, he truſted for the reſt to his extemporaneous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>He did not endeavour to aſſiſt his eloquence by any geſticulations; for as no corporeal actions
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025154_0010_0FCE7272AF92F098"/>
have any correſpondence with theological truth, he did not ſee how it could be enforced by them.</p>
            <p>At the concluſion of weighty ſentences, both in preaching and prayer, he gave time, by a ſhort pauſe, for the proper impreſſion. His prayers were direct addreſſes to the Deity, not in florid expreſſions or in long and involved ſentences, but in eaſy language and ſhort periods. They comprehended every proper ſubject, yet with ſuch brevity and pertinency of expreſſion, that, at the concluſion, it was difficult to conceive what more or leſs could have been ſaid on each ſubject.</p>
            <p>He often preſſed on his hearers the duties of ſobriety, juſtice, and charity; but the inward and ſpiritual parts of religion, and the ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between GOD and the ſoul, took up a much larger ſhare of his diſcourſes. He aimed to reſcue theſe exerciſes from the charge of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, and to place them in ſuch a light as might ſhow their perfect conſiſtency with reaſon and common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Though exempt in almoſt every ſenſe of the term from mental infirmity, he was the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual victim of bodily weakneſs; his beſt ſchemes and moſt favourite exerciſes being perpetually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by it. In the month of September, 1712, he was ſeized with a violent fever which ſhook his conſtitution exceedingly, and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſuch a weakneſs of the nerves as made him ſubject to the hypochondria during the remainder of his life. The agitation of his ſpirits during this ſickneſs, the ſtate of his mind, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his recovery, are admirably deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated

in a poetical eſſay which is ſubjoined to theſe memoirs.</p>
            <p>One conſequence of this ſickneſs was, in the opinion of Dr. Watts, a ſufficient compenſation for all the miſeries which he endured. It was the means of introducing him to the family of an excellent perſon, Sir THOMAS ABNEY, alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of London, who, on a moſt generous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, invited him to his houſe whilſt in a low and languiſhing ſtate; where, for <hi>thirty-ſix</hi> years, he was treated with all the tenderneſs of fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

Sir Thomas died in about eight years after the Doctor's coming to reſide in his family; but he continued with his lady and her daughters to the end of his life, and the lady died in a year after him.<note n="*" place="bottom">The laſt branch of this amiable family, ELIZABETH ABNEY, died at Stoke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In that delightful retirement, without any care of his own, he had every thing which could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the enjoyment of life, and favour the purſuit of his ſtudies. He had the privilege of the country air and elegant gardens at Theobalds in Hertfordſhire, twelve miles from London; he ſaw company, or lived recluſe, as beſt ſuited his inclination, and the delicacy of his nervous ſyſtem. It was not till October 1716 that he was able, in any degree, to reſume his public miniſtry; and in the mean time, his aſſiſtant,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025154_0012_0FCE72742AC89F18"/>
Mr. PRICE, was, at his deſire and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, choſen by the church to be his colleague, and was ordained on the 3d of March, 1713. The inviolable friendſhip which ſubſiſted between them is evidenced by a clauſe in the Doctor's will, in which he ſtyles him "his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend and companion in the labours of the miniſtry," and leaves him a legacy "as only a ſmall teſtimony of his great affection for him, on account of his ſervices of love during the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harmonious years of their fellowſhip in the work of the goſpel."</p>
            <p>From the time of his reception into the kind and hoſpitable family of ABNEY, his life was no otherwiſe diverſified than by a ſucceſſion of valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able publications, and his attention to his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial functions when his health permitted.<note n="*" place="bottom">"As faſt as my health increaſes, you may aſſure yourſelves it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to your edification.

            <p>In 1728, the univerſities of Edinburgh and Aberdeen, in a moſt reſpectful manner, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge, conferred on him the degree of Doctor in Divinity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:025154_0013_0FCE72449B6E81B8"/>In the ſpring of 1739, he had a paralytic ſhock which ſeized one ſide, and from which he ſlowly recovered. For ſome time before, and always after this, his letters were dictated by himſelf, but written by an amanuenſis.</p>
            <p>His laſt ſickneſs was rather a decay of nature, worn out with infirmity and labour, than any particular diſtemper. His weakneſs increaſed by degrees, and at length confined him to his chamber and his bed, where gradually ſinking, he at laſt died without pain, on the 25th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1748, in the 75th year of his age.</p>
            <p>Toward the cloſe of life the active and ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powers of his mind failed; yet his confidence in GOD, through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, remained unſhaken. He was heard to ſay, "I bleſs GOD, I can lie down with comfort at night, not being ſolicitous whether I awake in this world or another."—"I ſhould be glad to read more, not to be more confirmed in the truth of the Chriſtian Religion or of its promiſes; for I believe them enough to venture an eternity upon them." When he was almoſt broken down by his infirmities, he obſerved in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with a friend, that "he remembered an aged miniſter who uſed to ſay that the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eminent chriſtians, when they come to die, have only the ſame plain promiſes of the goſpel for their ſupport as the common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. So, ſaid he, I find it. The plain promiſes of the goſpel are my ſupport, and I bleſs GOD that they are plain promiſes, that do not require much labor and pains to underſtand them; for I can do nothing now but look into
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025154_0014_0FCE7275E1CA5848"/>
my bible for ſome promiſe to ſupport me, and live upon that."</p>
            <p>When he found his temper tending to impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and ready to complain, that he could lead only a mere animal life, he would check him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus.—"The buſineſs of a chriſtian is to <hi>bear</hi> the will of GOD as well as to <hi>do</hi> it. If I were in health I could only be doing it; and I may bear it now. The beſt thing in obedience is a regard to the will of GOD; and the way to that is to get our inclinations and averſions as much as poſſible mortified." With ſuch a calm and peaceful mind, and with ſuch a lively hope did this faithful ſervant wiſh for the ſummons, and enter into the joy of his Lord.</p>
            <p>As a man, Dr. Watts was certainly a moſt amiable and excellent character. Could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe cheriſh the laurels which candor and piety have placed on his brow, they would flouriſh with immortal verdure. Pure and undiſſembled <hi>piety</hi> was the ſettled habit of his mind. Though he loved and enjoyed much retirement, yet he did not contract any thing of an affected ſtiffneſs or monkiſh auſterity; but on the contrary, the pleaſure and ſatisfaction which he found in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with GOD in ſolitude, made him the more eaſy and cheerful in his converſe with men.</p>
            <p>His <hi>humility</hi> was like a deep ſhade to ſet off his other virtues, and made them ſhine with a brighter luſtre. Though by his natural temper he was quick in reſentment, yet by his fixed habit he was gentle and inoffenſive. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired habit had no ſmall effect in forming his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025154_0015_0FCE7245B0721980"/>
ſentiments. For he thought he could not be laid too low, as a creature or a ſinner, that he might do honor to the perfections and grace of GOD. From this principle, in a great meaſure, roſe that high eſteem which he had for the chriſtian diſpenſation, ſo apparently calculated to exalt GOD and to humble man. Nor was his humility leſs conſpicuous in his outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior towards others. Hence flowed that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention, humanity and kindneſs, which could not but endear him to all who had the pleaſure of converſing with him, and which rendered him truly venerable in a much higher degree, than all the honors and applauſes which he received from the world.</p>
            <p>In cloſe connection with the grace of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were to be ſeen his <hi>candor</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> for which he was remarkably eminent. The love which he bore to his Saviour induced him cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially to embrace all whom he eſteemed his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine diſciples. No party names, no variety of ſentiments in matters of doubtful diſputation, nor of practice in mode of worſhip, could divide him in affection from ſuch as he had reaſon to hope loved Chriſt in ſincerity. He therefore main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a free and friendly correſpondence with chriſtians of various parties and denominations.<note n="*" place="bottom">In one of his letters to Dr. Colman, after thanking him for his picture, he ſays, "I have put it in a frame that it may hang in the ſame rank with Dr. Increaſe and Dr. Cotton Mather, in the front of my ſtudy.

Though he judged the principles of the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate nonconformiſts moſt favorable to chriſtian liberty, and the rights of conſcience, and their forms of worſhip moſt agreeable to the ſimplicity of the goſpel, yet he had a high veneration for the perſons and writings of many miniſters and chriſtians of the eſtabliſhed church, as many of them had for him and his works.</p>
            <p>In the delineation of his character Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has juſtly obſerved, <note n="†" place="bottom">Lives of the Poets. vol. 111.</note> "ſuch was he as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chriſtian church would rejoice to have adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." To which he afterward ſubjoins. "Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py will be that reader whoſe mind is diſpoſed by his verſes or his proſe to imitate him <hi>in all but his non-conformity,</hi> to copy his benevolence to man and his reverence to GOD."</p>
            <p>This is doubtleſs the higheſt praiſe which it was in the power of ſuch a man as Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to beſtow; being himſelf a pious and zealous member of the epiſcopal communion eſtabliſhed by law in <hi>South</hi> Britain, he thought a conformity to that church eſſential to chriſtian perfection. But to other good men who do not ſee perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro' that medium, the non-conformity of Dr. Watts is ſo far from being a blemiſh in his character, that it is really an evidence of his hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic virtue. Born and educated among the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a time which tried men's ſouls, he had early been taught to ſuffer in the cauſe of truth; and he could not think leſs favorably of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025154_0017_0FCE7248E365CC50"/>
(eſpecially about the time of his ordination) he would have incurred the odium, not only of ſeeking his perſonal ſafety and worldly emolument by deſerting his brethren in a time of danger, but of joining the party who had in their hands the power of oppreſſing them. Such views as theſe his generous ſoul abhorred; and therefore cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced as he was, a conformity to the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, inſtead of adding luſtre to his character would have greatly detracted from it. Firm to his principles, attached to his brethren, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of perſonal danger; he choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of GOD, than to baſk in the ſunſhine of courtly favor and ſtand candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for eccleſiaſtical dignities.</p>
            <p>But his choice was not merely the reſult of prejudice or attachment. He had candidly and thoroughly examined the controverſy, and was perſuaded in his own mind, that a diſſent from the eſtabliſhed church was warrantable and ſafe. His ideas of religious liberty were generous, and his candor toward other men extenſive; but, for himſelf, he preferred the original ſimplicity of goſpel inſtitutions to the ornaments and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of later ages. His ideas on this head can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better explained than in a ſhort and elegant eſſay publiſhed among his poſthumous works, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, "The Diamond Painted," which may be ſeen in the appendix.</p>
            <p>Though Dr. Watts paſſed his whole life in a ſtate of celibacy, yet it is evident, from ſeveral of his poems, particularly thoſe on Queen Mary and Lady Sunderland, that he was far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to female charms; and from his "In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian

               </note> which is the more ungenerous as Watts has, in ſeveral parts of his writings, mentioned Young and his compoſitions with reſpect and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. The late Dr. COLMAN of Boſton, who was intimately acquainted both with Dr. Watts and Miſs Singer, uſed to tell this ſtory; that after long heſitation and delay, Dr. Watts ventured to declare to Miſs Singer his affection for her and to aſk her hand; to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an anſwer which muſt have mortified him extremely; that ſhe had long expected his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, but had on the preceding <hi>day</hi> given her conſent to the ſolicitation of Mr. ROWE.

            <p>Few men have left behind them ſuch purity of character, or ſuch monuments of laborious piety. He has provided inſtruction for all ages; from
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025154_0019_0FCE724B4E7BA440"/>
thoſe who are liſping their firſt leſſons to the profound inquirers into moral philoſophy. He has left neither corporeal nor ſpiritual nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined; he has taught the art of reaſoning and the ſcience of the ſtars. For the benefit of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he condeſcended to lay aſide the ſcholar, the philoſopher and the wit, to write little poems of devotion and ſyſtems of inſtruction adapted to their wants and capacities, from the dawn of reaſon through its gradations of advance in the morning of life. Every man acquainted with the common principles of human action, will look with veneration on the writer who is at one time combating LOCKE, and at another mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a catechiſm for children in their fourth year. A voluntary deſcent from the dignity of ſcience is perhaps the hardeſt leſſon which humility can teach.</p>
            <p>As his mind was capacious, his curioſity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive, and his induſtry continual, his writings are very numerous, and his ſubjects various. His character, as an author, muſt therefore be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the multiplicity and diverſity of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, rather than from any ſingle perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. It would not be ſafe to claim for him the higheſt rank in any ſingle denomination of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary dignity; yet perhaps there was nothing in which he would not have excelled if he had not divided his powers to different purſuits.</p>
            <p>As a <hi>poet,</hi> had he been only a poet, he would have ſtood high among authors of that claſs. His judgment was exact, and he noted beauties and faults with very nice diſcernment. His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination was vigorous and active, and the ſtores
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025154_0020_0FCE727D2D3B4CC8"/>
of knowledge were large by which his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were ſupplied. His ear was well tuned, and his diction was elegant and copious. But his devotional poetry is (in the opinion of Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) unſatisfactory. The paucity of its topics en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces perpetual repetition, and the ſanctity of its matter rejects the ornaments of figurative diction. "It is ſufficient," ſays this critic, "that Watts hath done better than others, what no man has done well."</p>
            <p>The propriety of theſe remarks has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted. "There is no ſubject," ſays Mr. Palmer, "whoſe topics are ſo various as thoſe which religion ſupplies, or which are better adapted to admit of poetical images. Religion comprehends all the perfections and works of the Deity, the wonders of nature and Providence, and the greater wonders of grace and redemption; the incarnation, life, miracles, ſufferings, death and reſurrection of the Son of GOD; the awful ſcenes of mortality, the reſurrection of the dead, the ſolemnity of the future judgment and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as well as the ſublime virtues of piety and benevolence. Theſe general ſubjects, with all their ſubordinates, ſupply an infinite variety of topics, and admit a figurative diction. Witneſs the ſublime compoſures of the ſacred prophets, in which the loftieſt images and boldeſt figures are introduced in almoſt every line."</p>
            <p>His poems on other ſubjects ſeldom riſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than might have been expected from the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a man of letters, and have different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of value as they are more or leſs labored, or as the occaſion was more or leſs favorable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:025154_0021_0FCE724C6A72B300"/>As he writes often without regular meaſures, and too often in blank verſe, the rhymes are not always ſufficiently correſpondent. His lines are commonly ſmooth and eaſy, and his thoughts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly pure. He is at leaſt one of thoſe few poets with whom the young and unlearned may be ſafely pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Of his <hi>philoſophical</hi> works, his logic as well as his geography and aſtronomy, have been received into the univerſities both of Britain and America, and therefore need no further recommendation.

            <p>In his <hi>metaphyſical</hi> diſquiſitions, it was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the late learned Mr. DYER, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the idea of <hi>ſpace</hi> with that of <hi>empty ſpace</hi>; and did not conſider that though ſpace might be without matter, yet matter could not be without ſpace.</p>
            <p>Few books have been peruſed by the judicious with greater pleaſure or are more uſeful than his "Improvement of the Mind;" of which the radical principles may indeed be found in LOCKE's "Conduct of the Underſtanding;" but they are ſo expanded and ramified by Watts as to confer upon him the merit of a work in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree uſeful and pleaſing. Whoever has the care of inſtructing others, may be charged with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience in his duty if this book be not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>controverſial</hi> works, we cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the meekneſs of his oppoſition and the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025154_0022_0FCE727EABFD6DC8"/>
of his cenſures. It was not only in his book, but in his mind, that <hi>orthodoxy</hi> was united with <hi>charity.</hi> When he engaged in controverſy, it was evidently with a view to heal and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile diſputes among chriſtians, rather than to make proſelytes to any party: however any may differ from him in judgment, all muſt allow, that he wrote on ſuch occaſions with a ſpirit of moderation, meekneſs and love, which was truly exemplary. This moderation however expoſed him to the ſeverity of the bigots of oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who are generally diſpoſed to give no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the man who is of no party. Of this Dr. Watts was ſufficiently ſenſible, and it was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently remarked by him, that "a moderate man muſt expect a box on both ears."</p>
            <p>Whatever ſubject he took in hand was, by his inceſſant ſolicitude for ſouls, converted to theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. As piety predominated in his mind, it is diffuſed over all his writings; and it is impoſſible to read a page in his works without learning, or at leaſt wiſhing to be better.</p>
            <p>His own account of his ſermons is this,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dedication of his 1ſt vol. of ſermons to his church.</note> "I have not entertained you with lectures of philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophy inſtead of the goſpel of Chriſt; nor have I affected that eaſy indolence of ſtyle, which is the cold and inſipid pleaſure of men who pretend to politeneſs.

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025154_0023_0FCE7251A3236068"/>
humble ſubſerviency to the promiſed influences of the holy ſpirit. I ever thought it my duty to preſs the conviction with force on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when light was firſt let into the mind. A ſtatue hung round with moral ſentences, or a marble pillar inſcribed with divine truth, may coldly preach to the underſtanding, whilſt devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion freezes at the heart; but the prophets and apoſtles were burning and ſhining lights. They were taught by inſpiration to make the words of truth glitter like ſun-beams, and to operate like a two-edged ſword. The movements of ſacred paſſion may be the ridicule of an age which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to nothing but calm reaſoning. Life and zeal in the miniſtry of the word may be deſpiſed by men of lukewarm and dying religion. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of ſpirit in the ſervice of the Lord, may become the ſcoff and jeſt of the critic and the profane; but this very life and zeal, this ſacred fervency will remain a bright character of a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian preacher, till the names of PAUL and APOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOS periſh from the church, till the bible and the heavens be no more."</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of Dr. Watts's character, as drawn by Dr. Gibbons, is this: "His truth and ſincerity were very conſpicuous. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him which could be ſtyled art and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. He never diſcovered in his behaviour or converſation any thing like a high opinion of himſelf, nor did he ſhew a diſpoſition to traduce or depreciate the characters and abilities of others. In meats and drinks he was very moderate. There was nothing in him which betrayed a penurious temper. He was very rich, but it was in good
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025154_0024_0FCE72804746D2D0"/>
works, for he deſired not to lay up his treaſure on earth, but in heaven.</p>
            <p>"He never diſcovered any thing like a furious zeal or a narrow deciſive ſpirit; but cordially em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced all whom he eſteemed the genuine diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Lord.</p>
            <p>"His ſoul, which glowed with gratitude for the favors he received, was alſo eminent for its friendſhip. He was nobly avaricious of time, and ever watchful to improve it."</p>
            <p>But there was one diſtinguiſhing feature in his character which both Gibbons and Johnſon have entirely paſſed over, and that was his love of truth, and his freedom, impartiality, diligence and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in his inquiries after it. It is indeed a character ſeldom to be met with, though of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar importance in a chriſtian miniſter, and therefore ought to be noticed with particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. In Dr. Watts it was conſpicuous in a very eminent degree.</p>
            <p>"In matters of the chriſtian faith," ſaith he,<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſcellaneous Thoughts, No. XLIX.</note> "I would make the ſcripture my guide and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a calm conference with myſelf in a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the oracles of GOD, in order to a deciſion of the ſenſe and meaning of them, not neglecting the aſſiſtance of pious and learned authors, but converſing very little with the angry and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious. I would with daily importunity addreſs the Father of Lights to ſhine upon his own word, and to diſcover his own meaning. I would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly implore the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation to take the things of Chriſt, and ſhew them to my underſtanding in a moſt convincing light.

My reaſon ſhould be uſed as a neceſſary inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to compare the ſeveral parts of revelation together, to diſcover their mutual explication, as well as to judge whether they run counter to any dictates of natural light. But if an inquiſitive mind overleap the bounds of faith, and give the reins to all our reaſonings on divine themes, in ſo wide and open a field as that of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

               </gap> where they will ſtop. I have made the experiment of this in my own meditations, when I have given my thoughts a looſe and let them rove without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. Sometimes I ſeem to have carried rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with me even to the camp of <hi>Socinus</hi>; but then St. John gives my ſoul a twitch, and St. Paul bears me back again (if I miſtake not his meaning) almoſt to the tents of <hi>John Calvin.</hi> Nor even then do I leave my reaſon behind me. So difficult a thing is it to determine by mere reaſoning, thoſe points which can be learned by ſcripture only."</p>
            <p>In his advice to young ſtudents he cautions them <note n="*" place="bottom">Improvement of the Mind, page 287. 3d edit.</note> againſt "intereſting their warm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious zeal, in thoſe matters which are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evident in themſelves, or which are not fully examined and proved. For this zeal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right or wrong, when it is once engaged, will have a powerful influence to eſtabliſh the mind in thoſe doctrines which are really doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to ſtop up all the avenues of farther light. This will bring upon the ſoul a ſort of ſacred awe and dread of hereſy, with a concern to maintain whatever opinion we have eſpouſed as
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025154_0026_0FCE728514C87328"/>
divine, though perhaps it hath been eſpouſed without any juſt evidence, and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced as falſe and pernicious. We ought to be zealous for the moſt important points of our religion, and to contend earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the ſaints; but we ought not to employ this ſacred fervour of ſpirit in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of any article, till we have ſeen it made out with plain and ſtrong conviction to be a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and important point of faith or practice. Zeal muſt not reign over the powers of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but obey them. Even the moſt ſublime and myſterious doctrines of revelation are not to be believed without a reaſon for it; nor ſhould our pious affections be engaged in defence of them, till we have convincing proof that they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly revealed."</p>
            <p>The man who was capable of giving ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as this, for the inveſtigation of truth, muſt himſelf be ſuppoſed to be a ſincere lover of truth, and a diligent, humble, impartial inquirer after it. It is well known that his conduct agreed with the advice which he gave. Few men have more entirely diveſted themſelves of the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of education, or have diſcovered greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of inquiring and openneſs to conviction, than Dr. Watts. Though not haſty in giving up his early opinions, and very far from affecting a love of novelty in his religious ſentiments, it may truly be ſaid of him, that he ſought for truth as for hidden treaſures. He was willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive light from every quarter, and ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace whatever, upon free inquiry, appeared to be the truth, however contrary to his former ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

or to the prevailing opinion of thoſe in the higheſt reputation for the ſoundneſs of their faith, though expoſed to cenſure from bigots of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or from thoſe perſons whom he moſt eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whoſe good opinion he was moſt ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to preſerve.</p>
            <p>Accordingly it is well known that he did, in various particulars, differ in judgment from thoſe who have complimented themſelves with the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>rational.</hi> He thought for himſelf, and called no man maſter upon earth: And he ſhared the common fate of thoſe who do ſo, by incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the cenſure of ſome of the different parties who would have gloried to have had him of their own.<note n="*" place="bottom">Palmer, p. 40.</note>

            <p>Dr. Watts was a firm and zealous friend to New England, and kept up a correſpondence with ſome of our principal characters, both in the civil and clerical lines. Among theſe were Governors SHUTE and BELCHER, Drs. MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER and COLMAN, Meſſ. PRINCE and FOX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CROFT, Preſidents WILLIAMS, CLAP, and EDWARDS. Almoſt every gentleman who went from this country to England was fond of being recommended and introduced to him, and they always met with a welcome and cordial recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He frequently ſolicited benefactions, and made donations, particularly of books, to the colleges at Cambridge and New-Haven, and to the Indian miſſions on our eaſtern and weſtern
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025154_0029_0FCE72556A91EB30"/>
borders. His memory has always been deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly famous and reſpected here. His pſalms and hymns, his divine ſongs and catechiſms are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in vogue, and have perhaps been more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to aſſiſt the devotion of chriſtians, and the inſtruction of children, than any other writings, except the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>His imitation of the pſalms of David in the language of the New Teſtament, is generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be his capital production in poetry, though it is not particularly noticed by Johnſon, who has criticiſed his poems in general. Thoſe congregations who uſe it, have advantages for evangelical devotion ſuperior to thoſe who adhere to the other verſions. Its local imperfections have been remedied, and its deficiences ſupplied, in an American edition publiſhed by Mr. BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOW, which is now coming into general uſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides the pſalms, Dr. Watts compoſed three books of <hi>hymns and ſpiritual ſongs,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain many ſpecimens of ſublime and devotional poetry, calculated for the edification of chriſtian ſocieties, and recommended by the plainneſs of the compoſition and the ſmoothneſs of the verſe. If in ſome inſtances they may be thought leſs judicious than the pſalms, it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that moſt of them were written when the author was very young, and ſome when he was but a ſchool boy. It is much to be wiſhed that in his mature age he had corrected what was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile, and what he freely acknowledged to be faulty in ſome of theſe early compoſures. The late Mr. HENRY GROVE remarked to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that ſeveral of his hymns laid the ſtreſs of

            <p>It is remarkable that ſo low was the author's expectation with regard to the ſucceſs of this work, that, it is ſaid, he received no more than ten pounds ſterling for the copy.<note n="†" place="bottom">Palmer, p. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be improper in this place to take notice of what has been publiſhed to the world by Mr. BENJAMIN WILLIAMS in the preface to his collection of pſalms. He repreſents Dr. Watts as "a perſon of the moſt exemplary meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humility, perfectly good natured, and of ſuch unconfined charity, that he wiſhed to avoid every word and ſyllable which was likely to give the ſmalleſt offence to ſerious chriſtians of any denomination; and when he found in the latter part of his life, that he had not been ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this reſpect as he had aimed to be, he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for nothing more ardently than ſufficient health and time to reviſe both his pſalms and hymns, in order to render them wholly unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to every chriſtian profeſſor.</p>
            <p>"This account, Mr. Williams obſerves, was received from Dr. Watts himſelf a few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, by Dr. AMORY, and by him giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to one of his pupils, who communicated it to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025154_0031_0FCED97779E0D560"/>
the editor. The editor alſo ſays he had good reaſon to add that "the reviſal ſo fervently wiſhed for, was undertaken and finiſhed, and would moſt certainly have been publiſhed, had not the author's death unhappily prevented."<note n="*" place="bottom">Monthly Review, 178<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As the Lives of Dr. WATTS and Dr. DOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRIDGE are united in this publication, it may not be improper to take notice of the beginning and progreſs of their connexion with each other. Doddridge was about twenty-eight years young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Watts, and had no acquaintance with him till it was introduced in the following manner. Doddridge being a hopeful and riſing young min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter among the diſſenters, was requeſted by a Mr. BENYON, of Shrewſbury, to write his thoughts on the beſt method of conducting the preparatory ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of young gentlemen intended for the miniſtry. When he had juſt finiſhed the work, his friend died, and the treatiſe remained in his own hands.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025154_0032_0FCE72895E65EBE0"/>
Mr. SAUNDERS, of Kettering, happening to ſee it in his ſtudy, borrowed it and ſhewed it to Dr. Watts. He was much pleaſed with the plan, and having made ſome remarks upon it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to ſeveral of his friends. They all joined with him in ſoliciting Doddridge to carry it into execution. This was the beginning of that famous academy in which Doddridge ſhone with the higheſt luſtre as a tutor, and alſo of an intimate friendſhip between him and Dr. Watts.</p>
            <p>It had been for many years one of Dr. Watts's earneſt deſires to compoſe a treatiſe of practical and experimental divinity; but his growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities prevented his executing it. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrongly recommended the matter to Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge as the fitteſt perſon in his acquaintance to perform it in the moſt acceptable manner. It was with much reluctance that he undertook ſuch a work among his other conſtant and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concerns. But Dr. Watts's heart was ſo much ſet on the deſign, and he urged it with ſuch preſſing importunity, that Doddridge could not deny his requeſt, after having been honored with his friendſhip for ſo many years, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving much encouragement and aſſiſtance from him, in ſeveral of his undertakings. When it was finiſhed, Dr. Watts reviſed as much of it as his health would permit, and it was firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1745, unter the title of "The Riſe and Progreſs of Religion in the Soul," with a dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Dr. Watts.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton's Life of Doddridge, chap. III and VII.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The opinion which Dr. Watts had of Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge appears from the following letter which
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025154_0033_0FCE725B99A51BF8"/>
he wrote to Mr. Longueville, miniſter of the Engliſh church at Amſterdam.</p>
            <p>"It is a very agreeable employment to which you call me, and a very ſenſible honor you put upon me when you deſire me to give you my ſentiments of that reverend and learned writer Dr. Doddridge, to be prefixed to a tranſlation of any of his works into the Dutch tongue. I have well known him many years, and have enjoyed a conſtant intimacy and friendſhip with him ever ſince the providence of GOD called him to be a profeſſor of human ſciences, and a teacher of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred theology to young men among us who are trained up for the miniſtry of the goſpel. I have no need to give you a large account of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the ſciences, in which I confeſs him to be greatly my ſuperior; and as to the doctrines of divinity and the goſpel of Chriſt, I know not any man of greater ſkill than himſelf, and hardly ſufficient to be his ſecond. As he hath a moſt exact acquaintance with the things of GOD and our holy religion, ſo far as we are let into them by the light of nature and the revelations of ſcriptures, ſo he hath a moſt happy manner of teaching thoſe who are younger.

               </gap> were any man to whom Providence would ſuffer me to commit a ſecond part of my life and uſefulneſs in the church of Chriſt, Dr. Doddridge ſhould be the man. If you have read that excellent performance of his, intitled, "<hi>The Riſe and Progreſs,</hi>" &amp;c. you will be of my mind. His dedication of it to me is the only thing in the book I could hardly permit myſelf to approve. Beſides all this, he poſſeſſeth a ſpirit of ſo much charity, love, and goodneſs toward his fellow chriſtians, who may fall into ſome leſſer differences of opinion, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a follower of the bleſſed Jeſus, his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and mine.

            <p>So high an eſteem had he of this valuable friend, that by his laſt will he left the care of his manuſcripts, and of republiſhing his printed works, to him, in conjunction with Dr. DAVID JENNINGS. Doddridge died in 1752, and the complete edition of Watts's works in ſix quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to volumes, came out in 1753. Many of his works have ſince been reprinted ſeparately, and it is probable that future editions of them will be called for by the pious and learned of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages.</p>

                  <p>IT was the cuſtom of <hi>David,</hi> as appears by ſeveral of his pſalms, and it was the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Jonah,</hi> kings and prophets, to rehearſe the agonies of their diſtreſs, when they offered to heaven their ſongs of deliverance. They recollected their hours and days of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the workings of their ſoul amidſt their ſharp and grievous ſorrows, to make the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their ſalvation the ſweeter, and ſo kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the zeal of their gratitude to a higher flame. Is it a matter of blame to imitate ſuch exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? Doth not the reaſon hold good in our age, and to all generations? Why ſhould a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> be any more afraid to tell the world of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions or diſtreſſes than a <hi>Jew?</hi> Or why ſhould he be aſhamed to let them know, that amidſt thoſe ſinkings of life and nature, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> were his ſupport? Amidſt all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of my diſtemper, and the tireſome months of it, I thank GOD I never loſt ſight of reaſon or religion, though ſometimes I had much ado to preſerve the machine of animal nature in ſuch order as regularly to exerciſe either the man or the chriſtian, eſpecially when I ſhut my eyes to ſeek ſleep and repoſe, and had not their aid to fence againſt the diſorderly ferments of natural ſpirits. But theſe conflicts are deſcribed in the following lines. Bleſſed be GOD for preſerving and healing mercy!</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOUR grief is great and juſt. It is not in the power of verſe to charm it: Your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts muſt ariſe from a diviner ſpring. My reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your family hath made me a witneſs to the luſtre of Sir THOMAS ABNEY's character, and to the years of your felicity; and I bear a ſenſible ſhare in the ſorrows that are ſhed on his tomb.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>nation</hi> mourns a good man loſt from the midſt of us, a public bleſſing vaniſh'd from the earth. The <hi>city</hi> mourns the loſs of a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent magiſtrate, a ſure friend to virtue, and a guardian to the public peace. The CHURCH of CHRIST mourns a beautiful pillar taken from the ſupport and ornament of the temple. All theſe are public ſorrows; but <hi>your loſs,</hi> MADAM, carries a pain in it, that muſt be unknown to all but ſuch as knew the domeſtic virtues of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who have the honor of your Ladyſhip's acquaintance, can tell whence you derive your daily conſolations; even from that world where
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025154_0052_0FCE72A0233F8F40"/>
your departed relative drinks them at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain head. O may thoſe ſtreams deſcend in full meaſure hourly, and refreſh yourſelf and your mourning houſe!</p>

                        </gap> a verſe to attend theſe few memorials of Sir THOMAS ABNEY's life. His modeſty hath concealed a thouſand things from the world which might have ſtood as witneſſes of his piety and goodneſs, but he thought it ſufficient that his record was on high: yet your unfeigned love follows him to the grave, and would do every thing that might adorn his name and memory. Since you have called me to this piece of ſervice, the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that your Ladyſhip hath laid upon me are ſtrong enough to ſummon up my youthful powers and talents, even when I look upon them as buried and almoſt forgotten.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, MADAM, there are ſome occurrences that can of themſelves rouze the muſe from the deepeſt ſleep. Poeſy is not always under the command of the will. As there have been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions heretofore when I have wiſhed to write, but the imagination has refuſed to attend the wiſh; ſo there are ſeaſons when verſe comes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without a call, and the will might reſiſt in vain. A few ſuch ſeaſons have I met with in the courſe of my life, and ſome of them have found me even in the chambers of death. When I have ſpent days in the midſt of mourning, and the whole ſoul hath been turned to ſorrow, the harp hath ſounded of its own accord, and awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened

all the doleful ſtrings. Such was the hour when your dear and honored brother Mr. THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS GUNSTON departed this life; and ſuch is the preſent providence. Uncommon worth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking our world, ſtrikes all the powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with ſentiments of honor and grief, and the hand and the heart conſent to raiſe a monument of love and ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Accept then, <hi>honored</hi> MADAM, theſe lines of <hi>elegy,</hi> as a ſincere pledge of the greateſt venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which my heart pays to the memory of Sir THOMAS ABNEY. How far ſoever the verſe may fall below the theme, yet now it muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways live, ſince it is joined to theſe <hi>memoirs,</hi> and attached to a character that cannot die. And while ſucceeding ages ſhall read the honors due to the deceaſed, let them know alſo the gratitude I pay to your <hi>Ladyſhip,</hi> for the ſignal benefits of many years conferred on</p>

                  <p>HOW wide and unhappy a miſtake it is when chriſtians endeavour to adorn their <hi>pure divine worſhip</hi> by the mixture of it with <hi>ceremonies</hi> of <hi>human invention.</hi> The ſymbolical ordinanances of the goſpel have a noble ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in them: Their <hi>materials</hi> are <hi>water, bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> three of the moſt neceſſary and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things in human life; and their <hi>myſtic ſenſe</hi> is plain, natural and eaſy.

life and ſtrength. The application of theſe ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols is moſt ſimple, and natural alſo: We are commanded to <hi>waſh</hi> with the water, to <hi>eat</hi> the bread, and to <hi>drink</hi> the wine: moſt proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of our participation of theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of figures and emblems did the all-wiſe GOD think proper to appoint and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his church, when he brake the yoke of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> bondage, and aboliſhed a multitude of rites and ceremonies of his own ancient appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How plain, how natural, how glorious, how divine are theſe two <hi>chriſtian</hi> inſtitutions, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> if ſurveyed and practiſed in their original ſimplicity! but they are debaſed by the addition of any fantaſtic orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>What think ye of all the gaudy trappings and golden finery that is mingled with the <hi>chriſtian</hi> worſhip by the imaginations of men in the church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Are they not like ſo many ſpots and blemiſhes caſt upon a fair jewel by ſome fooliſh painter? Let the colours be never ſo ſprightly and glowing, and the luſtre of the paint never ſo rich, yet if you place them on a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond they are ſpots and blemiſhes ſtill. Is not this a juſt emblem to repreſent all the gay airs, and rich and glittering accoutrements wherewith the church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſurrounded her devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and her public religion?</p>
                  <p>The reformers of our worſhip in the <hi>church of England</hi> were much of this mind, for they boldly paſs this cenſure on many of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> ceremonies, that they <hi>entered into the church by

undiſcreet devotion and zeal without knowledge: They blinded the people, and obſcured the glory of God, and are worthy to be cut away and clean re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected:</hi> That they did <hi>more confound and darken, than declare and ſet forth Chriſt's benefits unto us,</hi> and reduced us again to a <hi>ceremonial law, like that of Moſes,</hi> and to <hi>the bondage of figures and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows:</hi> This is their ſentence and judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning many of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> rites, in the <hi>preface</hi> to the book of <hi>common prayer.</hi> Happy had it been for <hi>Great Britain</hi> if they had thought ſo concerning all of them, ſince they had all the ſame or a worſe original, and they all tend to the ſame unhappy end!

                  <head>No. I. An authentic Account of Dr. <hi>WATTS's</hi> laſt avowed ſentiments concerning the Doctrine of the <hi>TRINITY,</hi> the <hi>DEITY</hi> of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>OF all the controverſies which have been agitated in the chriſtian church, there is ſcarcely any one that has been more conſtantly kept up, or conducted with greater warmth, or with a more intemperate and unchriſtian zeal, than that of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or the Divinity of the Son and Spirit of GOD. It is unneceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the different opinions which have been held on theſe ſubjects, or to mention the names of their authors or principal abettors.</p>
                  <p>It is well known to moſt readers how the Trinitarian controverſy was revived in Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s time, both among the Clergy of the eſtabliſhed church, and the Diſſenting miniſters, and to what height matters were carried by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending parties. Some yet living well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what it might be wiſhed ſhould for ever be forgotten, the animoſities which prevailed at the meetings of the London miniſters at <hi>Salters Hall,</hi> on the buſineſs of Subſcription to a Teſt propoſed for aſcertaining the orthodoxy of thoſe that belonged to that body, with reſpect to theſe points of doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:025154_0075_0FCE72B9109BF018"/>Many of thoſe who had been always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to believe them refuſed to ſubſcribe any Teſt whatever, and of this number was Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> who, though he was in the main in the orthodox faith, and had written in defence of it, did not chooſe to ſet his hand to any human for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularies, which might be the occaſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious diſtinctions and unchriſtian ſeparations among brethren.</p>
                  <p>In this, as well as other diſputable matters, the natural mildneſs of his temper, and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged charity, which was the conſequence of his impartial inveſtigation of ſo difficult a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, led him to act the part of a moderator.</p>
                  <p>In his book entitled <hi>Ort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>

                     </gap>octrine among others, and inſerted an Eſſay to ſhew the room there is for mutual forbearance and candor.</p>
                  <p>This moderation which the Doctor profeſſed and maintained, led ſome party-zealots to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he had departed from the faith, and there were thoſe who ſcrupled not to call him an <hi>Arian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of the matter was, that he no more deſerved this opprobrious name than thoſe who ſtigmatized him with it; tho' it muſt be owned, that his manner of conceiving and explaining ſome things relating to the Trinitarian doctrine was different from that of the generality of thoſe who were called orthodox.</p>
                  <p>In the younger part of life he ſeemed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the doctrine as it had been commonly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and had no objection to the uſual modes of expreſſion in relation to it. But, as it was not
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025154_0076_0FCE72BABB1FB630"/>
his character to take any thing upon truſt, he indulged a freedom of enquiry with reſpect to this ſubject of debate, as well as every other, and the conſequence was, he ſaw reaſon to alter his views concerning it.</p>
                  <p>With what ſeriouſneſs and humility he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted his enquiries, and how earneſtly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know the truth, appears from a piece found among his manuſcripts, entitled <hi>A Solemn Addreſs to the great and ever-bleſſed God,</hi> &amp;c. which is printed in the fourth volume of his works, and of which we ſhall hereafter give a copy at length.</p>
                  <p>It has been confidently aſſerted by ſome Anti-trinitarians, that the Doctor before his death was come over to their party, and that he left ſome papers behind him, containing a recantation of his former ſentiments, which his executors thought it moſt prudent to ſuppreſs. A report of this kind was lately revived, with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome remarkable circumſtances in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it, in the <hi>Monthly Review,</hi> of which we ſhall take ſome diſtinct notice hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Some zealous patrons of the moſt rigid ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, unwilling to have ſo eminent a divine as Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> numbered among the apoſtates from it, have zealouſly maintained ſuch reports as the above to be mere fictions; others have allowed that he might have expreſſed himſelf unguarded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that he had adopted ſome modes of ſpeech inconſiſtent with his former views on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but have endeavoured to exculpate him by urging the decay of his faculties, through age and intenſe application to ſtudy. And others
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025154_0077_0FCE72EDABBDE810"/>
have allowed that he had indeed for a time given into Anti-trinitarian ſentiments, but that before his death he was happily recovered to the right faith. As a proof of the reality of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion one Mr. <hi>Toplady,</hi> in a periodical publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was raſh enough to print a Hymn of the Doctors on the Deity of Chriſt, which he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied bore the evident marks of the infirmities of age. But unhappily for this writer theſe were in reality the infirmities of youth: for this Hymn was actually inſerted in the firſt edition of the <hi>Lyric Poems,</hi> and by the author himſelf left out of the ſubſequent ones. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance Dr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> has particularly mentioned, with a ſevere and juſt cenſure of Mr. <hi>Toplady,</hi> both for his temerity in publiſhing this hymn as the production of the author's old age, and alſo for his groundleſs aſſertions reſpecting the decay of his mental faculties.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> however has taken care to avoid ſaying any thing which might lead to a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with reference to any alteration of Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s ſentiments about the Trinity; which occaſioned ſome unknown writer to addreſs to him a letter in the <hi>Weſtminſter Magazine,</hi> of which it may not be amiſs to inſert a copy, which is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

                        <p>IN your "Memoirs" of the truly great and excellent Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> you certainly did right in attempting to rectify any miſtakes into which
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025154_0078_0FCE72BDABB0F790"/>
the Public had been led, concerning him or his writings, by any erroneous accounts iſſued from the pens of ignorant or evil-deſigning men. I was glad to find that you had ſo well refuted the idle ſtories which have been ſo generally report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and credited concerning the Doctor's "loſs of his intellects" in the latter part of his life, and "his ſtrange chimeras of fancy," which a late Biographer (you ſay Mr. <hi>Toplady)</hi> hath retailed much to his diſadvantage. I was alſo glad that you had expoſed a palpable "miſtake" (if not pious fraud) of the ſame writer reſpecting a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical piece of the Doctor's "on the Sufferings and Glory of CHRIST," as one of the lateſt of his compoſures, p. 313.</p>
                        <p>But I am greatly ſurpriſed to find that you have paſſed over in total ſilence a matter of far greater moment than either of theſe, which the ſame writer mentions, with equal confidence, in the very ſame paper; and for the ſake of which alone this Poem is introduced. "He tells us, "that the Doctor had fallen into erroneous no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with reſpect to the Doctrine of the Trinity —but that GOD had mercy upon him before he left the world, and recovered him to the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox faith:" and as a proof of this he produces the above Hymn, which he ſays, "to the beſt of his knowledge, had never before appeared in print, and which ſeems, from the unfiniſhed ſtate in which he left it, to have been one of the laſt products of his poetical pen." Give me leave, Sir, to ſay, that it appears to me, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of your readers, very extraordinary that you ſhould have thought it worth your while to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert

(and that with ſome degree of ſeverity) upon a chronological error of ſuch ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in itſelf, and to uſe ſo many words to ſatisfy us that the Doctor wrote this piece in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and to account for its being omitted in the later editions of his Poems; and yet that you ſhould not have ſaid "one word" reſpecting "the grand matter of fact" for the ſupport of which this piece is produced, and for which only the lateneſs of its date is aſſerted. From your total ſilence with regard to the fact itſelf, your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who have ſeen Mr. <hi>Toplady</hi>'s account, are not merely left in a ſtate of ſuſpenſe; but, as you have, by proving the early date of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em, removed his only argument that Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> was recovered from his ſuppoſed errors before his death, you have left us to conclude that he died in them: and, moreover, by maintaining "the ſoundneſs of his intellects," you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived his friends and admirers of a plea which has often been "charitably" urged in his favour. Thus have you left the "Sabellians" to triumph, as having the mature judgment, the dying ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the learned, the pious, the impartial <hi>Watts</hi> on their ſide; for his later publications ſeem moſt to favour the "Sabellian" ſcheme.</p>
                        <p>It has been pretty generally reported, that the Doctor left ſome papers to be publiſhed after his death, containing his laſt ſentiments on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which had been the object of his laborious and impartial enquiry through a great part of his life; but his executors thought it moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſuppreſs, if not deſtroy them. The Public have a right to aſk you, Sir, what was
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025154_0080_0FCE72BF2B8816B8"/>
the real matter of fact? You juſtly obſerve, that "perſons who attempt to communicate to the public the memoirs of deceaſed perſons, ought to make themſelves acquainted with their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, dates," &amp;c. And ſurely thoſe who write the lives of eminent Divines, ſhould be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and ready to communicate, what was moſt remarkable concerning their religious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and the reſult of their enquiries after TRUTH: an object, let me ſay, of far greater importance, and more worthy of being known, than the higheſt degree of "poetical" merit. It would not be a mere matter of "curioſity" to know the laſt ſentiments of ſo great and good a man as Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> with regard to the Trinity; but it would have had a very important tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to aſſiſt others in forming their judgment on ſuch a capital article of Chriſtian faith. It would likewiſe tend to remove the prejudices, and abate the cenſures, of many againſt thoſe who cannot aſſent to the popular opinions (or rather the popular "phraſeology") to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (if indeed it be ſo) that even Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who had been under ſtrong and early pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices in their favour, and had written in defence of them, was obliged at length to give them up. As, on the other hand, if it be true (as Mr. <hi>Toplady</hi> affirms) that though this eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine had departed from the Catholic Doctrine for a time, he was reclaimed before he died; the knowledge of it, together with the occaſion of his fall, and the means of his recovery, might be inſtrumental to guard others againſt, and recover them from, the ſame erroneous opinions.</p>

And give me leave to ſay, that candor and juſtice call upon you to declare what you know concerning it.

                  <p>But though it is undeniable that Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> did not continue in the ſame views of the ſubject which he entertained in the early part of his life, there is no deciſive evidence that he materially altered his ſentiments concerning the Trinitarian doctrine within any ſhort ſpace of his death, and it is highly improbable that he ſhould. He had for many years made this point the ſubject of his laborious and impartial ſtudy, and within about two years of his diſſolution he publiſhed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his enquiries, from which it is ſcarcely credible that he ſhould in ſo ſhort a time have greatly deviated.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Watts died Nov. 25, 1748. His book entitled <hi>Uſeful and Important Queſtions concerning Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> is dated 1746. And the ſame year (moſt probably towards the cloſe of it) he printed another work, in which he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtrates and defends his opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon of Chriſt, entitled <hi>The Glory of Chriſt as God-man diſplay'd,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering how many years the Doctor had made this ſubject his ſtudy, how deliberate he was in forming his ſentiments, and how cautious he was of publiſhing them to the world, it ſeems moſt natural to look for his laſt ſentiments on this much diſputed point in theſe two pieces; and the rather as the book which was written againſt him on the <hi>Arian</hi> ſide by Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="unknown:025154_0083_0FCE72F3BA0D38A8"/>
(which might be thought moſt likely to have made him a convert, if he had been one) was printed previous to either of theſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">The title of this work was, <hi>A Sober Appeal to a Turk on an Indian,</hi> concerning the plain ſenſe of ſcripture relating to the Trinity.

                  <p>It is certain theſe pieces contain the laſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic account of his ſentiments, as avowed by himſelf, and therefore till ſome deciſive proof be brought of a ſubſequent recantation, the view which theſe books give of the matter, might juſtly be conſidered as Dr. Watts's laſt thoughts on the ſubject of the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>From theſe it is abundantly evident that he had not given into the <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, for he expreſſes himſelf ſtrongly againſt both, and maintains poſitions inconſiſtent with either. But it muſt at the ſame time be allowed that he evidently appears to have deviated from the moſt commonly received opinions, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son and Spirit of God, though he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the true Divinity of both, which he did upon ſuch grounds as he thought beſt ſecured every thing eſſential to the doctrine and moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually obviated the objections of its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</p>
                  <p>It is true, ſome both among the Orthodox and the Heterodox conſidered him as having in theſe publications given up the point; the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he differed from them in his manner of explaining it, and the latter becauſe he admitted the force of ſome of their objections to it, and freely gave up what he thought untenable, and

perhaps eſpecially becauſe he exerciſed more candour towards them than the defenders of the Trinitarian doctrine had uſually done. But it is exceedingly ſtrange that the friends of orthodoxy ſhould diſown a man as a brother, and conſider him as an apoſtate and an enemy, becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents things in a manner different from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and maintains them on different grounds.

                  <p>It is ſurpriſing that they who lay ſo much ſtreſs upon candour, and are ſo ſevere againſt big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otry, ſhould themſelves act ſo uncandid a part.

firmeſt attachment to orthodoxy; and yet if any of the orthodox ſhew themſelves ready to make ſome abatements, and appear to exerciſe candour towards thoſe of different ſentiments, theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen will have it that they muſt, in their hearts, be on their ſide, and impeach their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in not joining their party; which they are willing to attribute to a ſordid attachment to their ſecular intereſt, or to any thing rather than to a <hi>real moderation in principle,</hi> of which bigots on both ſides ſeem to deny the exiſtence.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Preface</hi> to the firſt of the above pieces we ſhall here tranſcribe at length. It is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. "It cannot be of much importance for the reader to be informed who was the writer of theſe papers: yet if it will be any ſatisfaction, the author himſelf preſumes to ſay, It is one who has ſpent many years of his life in diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into the ſacred doctrines of the goſpel, by a conſtant and laborious ſearch of the holy ſcriptures; nor is he aſhamed to add, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual application to the GOD of all light and grace for the inſtruction of his Holy Spirit, that he might better underſtand the things diſcovered

in his word. He alſo takes the freedom to ſay theſe papers are the product of that part of his life when <hi>his powers of mind and body were in full vigour.</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">This is a ſufficient anſwer to thoſe who would exculpate the Doctor for his deviation from the beaten track by urging the decay of his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> The author has ſometimes been ready to ſuppoſe, that ſeveral of the Queſtions here propoſed may be very uſeful towards the further explaining ſome of thoſe parts of ſcripture which have been leſs ſtudied, eſpecially concerning <hi>God the Father,</hi> and the Divine and human natures of his <hi>Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom to know, to truſt in, and to love, is eternal life: and he thinks he can ſafely appeal to GOD concerning the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty and ſincerity of his own endeavours, to give a faithful anſwer to all theſe enquiries, according to the cleareſt light he could find in the holy ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>"He has one favour to beg of his readers, and that is, that they would not examine any of theſe papers by the mere dictates of their own reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers, for the ſubject is a mere matter of divine revelation; nor that they would take the ſentiments or ſchemes of elder or later writers, whether Schoolmen or Fathers, or Divines of any party, for a perfect teſt of truth and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy in theſe ſacred ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>"Yet he freely and delightfully confeſſes theſe following articles borrowed from the <hi>Athanaſian Creed,</hi> viz.
<q>We believe and confeſs the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of GOD is both GOD and Man; GOD of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father, a Man of the ſubſtance of his mother,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:025154_0087_0FCE72FA86B145A8"/>
                        <hi>born</hi> into the world, perfect GOD and perfect Man; of a reaſonable ſoul, and human fleſh ſubſiſting <hi>together:</hi> Equal to the Father as touching his Godhead, and yet inferior to the Father, as touching his manhood: One, not by converſion of the Godhead into the fleſh, but by taking of the manhood into GOD, <hi>ſo as to become one perſonal agent or</hi> one perſon: and as the reaſonable ſoul and fleſh is one man, ſo GOD and man are one Chriſt, who ſuffered for our ſalvation,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>"Though I freely and cheerfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all this, yet I take no human writings for a teſt of the divinity or truth of my opinions: And I could wiſh all my readers would lay aſide all other teachers, beſides the mere writers of the holy ſcriptures, in ſuch enquiries, where the light of theſe divine truths will alſo ſhine bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, which are not to be known by the mere light of nature, but are entirely to be learned by the revelation of GOD to his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and to his holy apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>"And if this practice be ſincerely purſued, the author humbly hopes theſe papers may find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance among the diligent and honeſt enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after truth, ſo far at leaſt as to have his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing miſtakes pitied and forgiven, and his ſincere endeavours accepted, to make known the ſcriptures to his fellow-chriſtians in thoſe import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant articles that relate to <hi>God the Father</hi> and his <hi>Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> which are of ſo much importance toward our ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>"Yet finally to avoid all objections and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of miſtake, I think it may be proper here
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025154_0088_0FCE72C9578360F0"/>
to take notice, that there have been generally two ways among our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divines allowed to explain the <hi>Filiation</hi> or Sonſhip of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in his Divine nature; the one is, the real and ſupernatural, which is granted to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incomprehenſible, relating chiefly to the <hi>nature</hi> of the Father and the Son; the other is ſcriptural and oeconomical, relating chiefly to their <hi>characters</hi> or <hi>offices</hi> in our ſalvation, which is more eaſy to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>"I muſt acknowledge I incline moſt to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> becauſe this allows the moſt perfect equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, even Oneneſs or <hi>Sameneſs</hi> in the Godhead, whether applied to the <hi>Father</hi> or the <hi>Son,</hi> and thus it maintains the true Godhead itſelf to be underived and ſelf-exiſtent in both; and upon this ſuppoſition I believe the ſecond of theſe writers have been always eſteemed perfectly ſound and orthodox as well as the firſt."</p>
                  <p>In this preface, as there are the ſtriking evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the greateſt humility and candour, as well as the moſt ardent love of truth, ſo the intelligent reader, who is at all verſed in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarian controverſy, will eaſily perceive that Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> differed from the generality of the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, who maintain
<q>that Chriſt as GOD was the Son of the Father, derived from him or begotten by him, and therefore really a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct perſon, or agent from the Father, but nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheleſs equal to him in all perfections;</q>
and that his idea of the Divinity of Chriſt was, "<hi>that the Godhead, the Deity itſelf, perſonally diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the</hi> FATHER, <hi>was united to the man Chriſt Jeſus, in conſequence of which union, or indwelling
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025154_0089_0FCE72FC15881D90"/>
of the Godhead, he became properly God.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi> ſeems to have held the ſame ſentiments, which were lately revived in a controverſy occaſioned by a publication of the late Mr. <hi>Benjamin Fawcell,</hi> entitled <hi>Candid Reflections,</hi> &amp;c.</note> And it is evident from the ſequel of this performance, and from a ſubſequent publication, he conceived this union to have ſubſiſted before the Saviour's appearance in the fleſh, and that <hi>the human ſoul of Chriſt exiſted with the Father from before the foundation of the world</hi>; on which ground he maintains the real deſcent of Chriſt from heaven to earth, and the whole ſcene of his humiliation, which he thought incompatible with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion concerning him.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> the Doctor ſeems not to have held the common notion of his real perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, as diſtinct from the Father, ſuppoſing it to mean the divine power or influence, or GOD himſelf as exerting his influence. But we have now particularly to do with the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the principal ſubject of the publications now under conſideration.</p>
                  <p>It is no part of our deſign to condemn or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Doctor's opinions on this point, but merely to repreſent them, and ſhew wherein they differed from the generality of other orthodox di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and to give a brief view of the arguments by which he ſupported them.</p>
                  <p>In his <hi>Important Queſtions concerning Jeſus the Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> which he propoſes is this—
<q>What is the true meaning of the Name <hi>Son of God,</hi> given to Chriſt in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and eſpecially where the belief of it is made neceſſary to ſalvation?</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="92" facs="unknown:025154_0090_0FCE72CB8ADD0568"/>In § I. he mentions the various ſenſes given to this term by different writers, and obſerves, that the firſt of them is patronized by many, viz.
<q>that it includes an eternal unconceivable gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the perſon of the Son by the perſon of the Father, in the ſameneſs of the Divine eſſence, conſubſtantial, coequal, and coeternal with the Father.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But I am perſuaded (ſays he) this can never be the ſenſe of this name in thoſe ſeveral texts before cited [where believing in the Son of GOD is ſaid to be neceſſary to ſalvation] for (1) If this be never ſo true, yet it is confeſſed to be unconceivable: and I do not think the gracious GOD would put ſuch a difficult teſt upon the faith of young diſciples, poor illiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate men and women.—(2) Nor is this clearly enough revealed for us to make it a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal article in any age, and to damn all who do not receive it.—(3) There have been ſome pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and learned men in ſeveral ages, who have acknowledged Chriſt's true Godhead, and yet have ſuppoſed that the Sonſhip of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred rather to his <hi>human nature,</hi> or to his <hi>office</hi> of <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> than to ſuch an eternal generation. There are ſome ſuch in our age, and I will never pronounce an anathema upon them.</q>

                  <p>After having mentioned ſeveral other ſenſes in which the term <hi>Son of God</hi> is uſed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he ſpeaks of this laſt, as what he believes to be its moſt common acceptation, (p. 16) eſpecially where the belief of it is made neceſſary to ſalvation. Having in § 2, urged ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to confirm this ſenſe, he ſtates ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jections

§ 3, and produces various paſſages from ſcripture in which

                        <hi>John</hi> v.18, 19. When the Jews had made a ſtrange inference, and charged Chriſt with making himſelf equal to GOD, becauſe he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed GOD his Father, he anſwered, <hi>Verily verily I ſay unto you, the Son can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſeeth the Father do,</hi> &amp;c.

The ſenſe of this expreſſion may be learned from <hi>John</hi> viii.38. Though there are ſome expreſſions in that paragraph to (ver. 30.) which ſeem ſuperior to the character of any mere creature, and which would hardly have been applied to Chriſt the man, if not united to Godhead, yet Chriſt conſidered as the Son of GOD is throughout repreſented as dependent on the Father for all, and receiving all from the Father, which is hardly conſiſtent with the idea of ſupreme Godhead, if that were included in Sonſhip.</q>

the language of Godhead, which is ſupreme and independent, and can do all things of itſelf, and by its own will.

All this implies inferiority and dependence. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xv.38. <hi>Then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject to him, that God may be all in all.</hi> This is a character of too much inferiority for Godhead. The argument ſtands thus: If the Son of GOD be true GOD, conſidered as a Son, then he is originally and neceſſarily Lord of all, and it muſt be ſaid it is by his own voluntary condeſcenſion that he is ſo far depreſſed and humbled by the oeconomy as to become the Father's deputy and vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and when that oeconomy ceaſes, he is of courſe exalted to his equality with the Father, and to his eſſential and natural Lordſhip over all. But the repreſentation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is juſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. In many parts of his writings, particularly <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. he ſhews that the Son of GOD is not depreſſed but exalted by the oeconomy to the kingdom. And he tells us in this text that when the Son gives up this oeconomical king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he comes again into ſubjection: <hi>then ſhall the Son himſelf be ſubject to the Father</hi>; which plainly ſhews that, conſidered as a Son, he is naturally ſubject to the Father, and that at the end of this oeconomical exaltation he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his natural ſubjection and ſhall be ſo for ever, when GOD appears <hi>all in all.</hi>

                  <p>The Doctor's <hi>Third</hi> queſtion (which leads to the diſcovery of his opinion concerning the pre-exiſtence of the human ſoul of Chriſt) is this,
<q>Could the Son of GOD properly enter into a Covenant with his Father, to do and ſuffer what was neceſſary to our redemption, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a human ſoul?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>It is granted (ſays he) that the generality of our chriſtian writers believe that it was only the divine nature or Godhead of Chriſt which had an exiſtence before he was conceived of the Virgin Mary, and became incarnate; yet when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they would repreſent the exceeding great love of the Father in ſending his Son into our world, that he might ſuffer and die for us, and deſcribe the tranſcendent love of Chriſt, in coming into the world and ſubmitting to death for our ſakes, they uſually repreſent it in ſuch language as can never agree with his <hi>Divine nature,</hi> in any propriety of ſpeech, but only to
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025154_0094_0FCE72CE943EA9B8"/>
the pre-exiſtent human ſoul of Chriſt, with its deſcent into fleſh and blood, and the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this human ſoul for us. And it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the ſcripture itſelf leads them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch a repreſentation of things—ſo that they are led by the force of truth into ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as are hardly conſiſtent with their own profeſſed opinions.</q>
He here quotes ſome paſſages from Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> and others, which ſpeak of the abaſement of Chriſt, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating change which he paſſed through, which are totally inapplicable to Godhead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Now if we ſuppoſe (ſays he) the human ſoul of Chriſt to have a pre-exiſtent ſtate of joy and glory with the Father before the world was created, theſe expreſſions are great and noble, are juſt and true, and have a happy propriety in them to ſet forth the tranſcendent love of the Father in ſending his Son, and of the Son of God in coming from heaven and leaving the joys and glories of his Father's immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to take on him fleſh and blood, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſhame, ſorrow, pain, anguiſh of fleſh and ſpirit, ſharp agonies and the pangs of death. And this love is exceedingly enhanced while we conſider that this human ſoul of Chriſt was perſonally united to the divine nature, ſo that hereby GOD himſelf becomes manifeſted in the fleſh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But on the other hand, if we ſuppoſe noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the <hi>pure divine nature</hi> of Chriſt to exiſt before his incarnation, then all theſe expreſſions ſeem to have very little juſtice or propriety in them: for the divine nature of Chriſt (how
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:025154_0095_0FCE73056B82EA80"/>
diſtinct ſoever it is ſuppoſed to be from GOD the Father) yet can never leave the Father's boſom, can never diveſt itſelf of any one joy or felicity that it was ever poſſeſſed of; nor could GOD the Father ever diſmiſs the divine nature of his Son from his boſom. Godhead muſt have eternal and complete beatitude and glory, and can never be diſpoſſeſſed of it. Godhead can ſuſtain no real ſorrow or ſufferings.—Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the human nature leave the boſom of the Father if it had no prior exiſtence.— But now if we conceive the ſoul of Chriſt, in its pre-exiſtent ſtate, as <hi>the firſt born of every creature,</hi> to <hi>come forth from the Father</hi> and <hi>come into the world</hi> (John xvi.28.) to part with the glories and joys it poſſeſſed, to dwell in a feeble manſion of fleſh, of pain and ſorrow, and ſuſtain the pangs of a curſed death, &amp;c. this is amazing love indeed; this has a ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſenſible reality in it, and ſhould awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en all the powers of our ſouls to admire and adore both GOD the Father for ſending him, and his Son for conſenting to ſuch abaſement.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There is another and a very remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, wherein our Proteſtant divines, in a very juſt and affecting manner repreſent the COVENANT of REDEMPTION, between the Father and the Son, according to ſcripture, upon the ſuppoſition of the pre-exiſtence of Chriſt's human ſoul: But according to the common or ſcholaſtic explication of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Perſons in the Trinity, we can have no ideas under all their glorious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate repreſentations of this tranſaction.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="unknown:025154_0096_0FCE72D1EEB7DAA8"/>
                     <q>The common or ſcholaſtic explication of the Trinity, which has been long and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally received and been called orthodox, is, That GOD is but one ſimple, infinite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit: Hence it follows, that the divine eſſence, powers, and eſſential properties of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head are numerically the very ſame. That it is the ſame numerical conſciouſneſs, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, will and power, which belongs to the Father, that alſo belongs to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: and that the ſacred three are diſtinguiſhed only by the ſuperadded rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive properties of paternity, filiation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; but their thoughts, ideas, volitions and agencies, according to this hypotheſis, muſt be the very ſame numerical thoughts, &amp;c. in all the three.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctor then proceeds to give an extract from a ſermon of Mr. <hi>Flavel,</hi> which he highly approves, relating to the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which he repreſents
<q>the perſons tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting with each other; the buſineſs tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the quality of the tranſaction as foederal; the Father promiſing to ſupport and reward the Son, the Son promiſing to obey the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's call to ſuffer, &amp;c. and the articles to which they agree, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
He further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that the author repreſents this tranſaction in a way of <hi>Dialogue,</hi> and then remarks thus:
<q>In reading ſuch accounts of ſtipulations and contract between the Father and the Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world, what proper conceptions can we frame, or what clear ideas
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:025154_0097_0FCE730806F4BF18"/>
can we poſſibly have, while we ſuppoſe nothing but Chriſt's <hi>divine nature</hi> tranſacting this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair with the Father, and while we believe the divine eſſence, perfections, and powers, the underſtanding, will, thought, and conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Father and the Son, to be numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally one and the ſame? ſince in the Godhead they are but one and the ſame infinite ſpirit? The mere perſonalities, paternity and filiation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſult and tranſact in a way of contract, propoſal and conſent: [which can only be done by] two diſtinct conſciouſneſſes and wills.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Further, one of theſe beings or perſons cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enanting, ſeems to be inferior to the other, and to be capable of receiving orders, commiſſion, ſupport and recompenſe from the other: But if only the <hi>Deity</hi> of Chriſt exiſted, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and the Father's have but one numerical conſciouſneſs and volition, one power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what need of orders and commiſſions, or of promiſes of ſupport and recompenſe? How can pure Godhead be ſupported or recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?—What poſſible difference can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive between the love of the Father in ſending the Son, and the love of the Son in conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—And how doth this abate our grand ideas of the diſtinct and condeſcending love of our bleſſed Saviour, in his conſent to this covenant, ſince that part of him which really ſuffered, i. e. his inferior nature, had then no exiſtence?</q>

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fourth Queſtion</hi> which the Doctor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes is this:
<q>Is the Godhead of Chriſt, and the Godhead of the Father, one and the ſame?</q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Or, in other words, is the Deity of Chriſt, or the being to whom the humanity of Chriſt is united, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>He anſwers in the affirmative, and proves it by the following arguments.
<q>(1.) If the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature of Chriſt be another diſtinct prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſelf-conſciouſneſs and volition, another diſtinct ſpiritual being, or another ſpirit, this approaches ſo near the doctrine of another GOD, that it is very hard to diſtinguiſh it. For ſo far as our ideas of arithmetic and reaſon can reach, this ſeems to be a plain truth,—If one infinite ſpirit be <hi>one God,</hi> two or three infinite ſpirits muſt be <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Gods.</hi> (2.) The
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:025154_0099_0FCE3837A69F9A90"/>
GOD of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, the GOD of Iſrael, the Almighty, Jehovah, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtyle and title by which GOD the Father was known under the Old Teſtament, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe he often appeared to the Patriarchs; yet it is agreed by all Trinitarians, that it was Jeſus Chriſt that appeared to them and aſſumed theſe titles. (3.) Several paſſages of the Old Teſtament cited by the writers of the New Teſtament, and applied to Chriſt, do evidently refer to the great <hi>one God,</hi> the GOD of Iſrael, whom all before the days of Chriſt muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to mean <hi>God the Father of all.</hi>—Theſe texts are properly applied to Chriſt, if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Godhead of the Father and of Chriſt to be <hi>the ſame,</hi> and THAT THE MAN CHRIST JESUS WAS THE SHEKINAH or HABITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF THE GREAT GOD, intimately and perſonally united to him. In this ſenſe Chriſt was <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> or GOD <hi>with us.</hi>—But the application of theſe texts to Chriſt will ſcarcely prove the Godhead of Chriſt, unleſs it be the ſame with that of the Father. (4.) When Chriſt expreſſes his own Godhead, it is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his <hi>oneneſs with the</hi> FATHER. <hi>I and the</hi> FATHER <hi>are one. He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the</hi> FATHER. <hi>I am in the</hi> FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, <hi>and the</hi> FATHER <hi>in me. The</hi> FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER IN ME <hi>doth the work.</hi> It is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe he would have always uſed theſe modes of ſpeaking, if he himſelf had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Godhead [or if he as man had been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a ſecond perſon in the Godhead and not to the FATHER.] (5.) On this ſuppoſition
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:025154_0100_0FCE38429BB36A58"/>
I do not ſee how the Trinitarians can ſolve the difficulties which ariſe from thoſe ſcriptures where GOD the Father is repreſented as the <hi>only true God,</hi> and under that idea diſtinguiſhed from Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> xvii.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> iv.5, 6. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> xliv.6, 8.xlv.21, 22. (6.) When our Saviour foretold that his diſciples ſhould leave him alone, he adds, (<hi>John</hi> xvi.32.) <hi>And yet I am not alone, becauſe</hi> THE FATHER <hi>is with me.</hi> If his Godhead had been diſtinct from that of the Father, he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the preſence of the <hi>Father</hi> for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; <hi>his own Godhead</hi> would have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>On the whole, whatever unknown diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there may be in the divine nature, to lay a foundation for GOD'S diſcovery of himſelf under three perſonal characters, as the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, yet the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Father ſeems to be the ſame one infinite and eternal Spirit, which under ſome peculiar diſtinction or relation, is united to the Man Chriſt Jeſus; and hereby Jeſus becomes one with GOD, &amp;c. By this means the great and fundamental article of all religion, the UNITY of the true GOD is maintained invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, and thus we moſt effectually preclude all the objections and cavils of the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> writers againſt the doctrine of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, and the Deity of Chriſt, as though this doctrine introduced <hi>more Gods than one</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if we ſuppoſe the Man Jeſus Chriſt, in his ſoul and body, to be both an intellectual and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal SHEKINAH, or habitation of the one

                  <p>From theſe extracts from Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s own writings, it is plain to every intelligent reader, what his ſentiments concerning the Deity of Chriſt were.

At the ſame time it is equally evident, that he had departed from what are generally called the orthodox ſentiments; or rather, perhaps it ſhould be ſaid, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>manner of explaining them</hi>; by which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he himſelf at leaſt thought he maintained genuine orthodoxy to the beſt advantage.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As the pre-exiſtence of Chriſt's ſpirit was the grand point which the Doctor laboured to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, in order to avoid the difficulties of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſcheme, which either makes DEITY <hi>to ſuffer,</hi> or makes the ſuffering Saviour a <hi>mere man,</hi> and thus coincides with Socinianiſm, we ſhall here preſent the reader with a view of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's manner of arguing to prove this point.</p>
                  <p>DISC. III. §. 3. He firſt argues <hi>from vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſiderations of ſomething inferior to Godhead aſcribed to Jeſus Chriſt before and at his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> e. g. I.
<q>Chriſt is repreſented as his Father's meſſenger, miniſter or angel, that was a diſtinct being from his Father, ſent by him to perform ſuch actions and ſervices for his people, long before his Incarnation, ſome of which ſeem too low for the dignity of pure Godhead.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II.
<q>Chriſt when he came into this world, is ſaid to empty and diveſt himſelf of ſome glory which he had before his Incarnation. Now if nothing but his divine nature exiſted before this time, this could not properly empty or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt itſelf of any glory; therefore it muſt be his inferior nature, or his human ſoul which did then exiſt.</q>
Under this head the Doctor conſiders that much diſputed paſſage, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025154_0106_0FCE731898F19EC0"/>
5—7. which he interprets thus.
<q>Here the apoſtle's deſign is to ſet Chriſt forth as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of humility; and this he doth by aggrandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing his former circumſtances, and repreſenting how he emptied himſelf of them, and appeared on earth in a very mean and low eſtate. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> i. e. his human ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in union with his Godhead, was inveſted with a God-like form and glory in all former ages; thus he oftentimes appeared to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs as the Angel of the Lord, and as GOD, or Jehovah, clothed with the divine <hi>Shekinah,</hi> and ſpake and acted like GOD himſelf. This ſeems to be the <hi>form of God</hi> which the apoſtle ſpeaks of. Nor did he <hi>think it any robbery</hi> or preſumption ſo to do, <hi>i. e.</hi> to appear and act AS GOD, ſince he was united to the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and was in that ſenſe <hi>one with God.</hi> Yet <hi>he emptied himſelf,</hi> i. e. he diveſted himſelf of this God-like form or appearance, this divine <hi>Shekinah,</hi> and coming into the fleſh he conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be made <hi>in the likeneſs of</hi> other <hi>men</hi>; nay, he took upon him <hi>the form of a ſervant,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>the form of God.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III.
<q>That very being which came down from heaven, and was ſent of GOD into the world, is repreſented as capable of having a will different from the will of GOD the Father, and therefore it muſt be inferior to Godhead: now this could be no other but the will of his human ſoul.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV.
<q>Chriſt repreſents his own coming into the world, and being ſent either by the Father,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:025154_0107_0FCE7319D21A9CF0"/>
in ſuch a manner as naturally leads one to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he had a real and proper dwelling in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, and in another manner, before he came into the world, and that he then changed his place and company, and manner of life; all which ſeems more agreeable to a human ſpirit than to a divine perſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctor then, § 4. mentions various <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous arguments to prove the ſame doctrine,</hi> e. g.</p>
                  <p n="1">I.
<q>It ſeems needful that the ſoul of Chriſt ſhould be pre-exiſtent, that it might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to give its previous actual conſent to the great and painful undertaking of atonement for our ſins. And indeed this voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his to become incarnate and to ſuffer is plainly repreſented in ſeveral places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> xl.6, 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> x.5, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">II.
<q>The Covenant between GOD the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, for the redemption of mankind, is repreſented in ſcripture as being made from or before the foundation of the world. [Muſt we not then ſuppoſe] that both parties ſhould be preſent, and that this ſhould not be tranſacted merely within the divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence by ſuch perſonalities as have no diſtinct mind and will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The eſſence of GOD is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed to be but one conſcious mind or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Now can one ſingle underſtanding and will make ſuch a covenant?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III.
<q>Chriſt's coming into the world is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expreſſed in ſome corporeal language, ſuch as denotes his taking on him animal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or body, or fleſh, without the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of taking a ſoul.</q>
                  </p>

<q>It is certain, that among the learned of the Jewiſh nation, there was a tradition of the pre-exiſtence of the ſoul of the Meſſiah.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V.
<q>Since it pleaſed the Father to prepare a body for our Lord Jeſus, by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, and by a peculiar manner of conception, that he might be the Son of GOD in a ſuperior ſenſe, with regard to his <hi>fleſh,</hi> ſo it is not unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that the <hi>ſoul</hi> of Chriſt alſo, which was to be united to Godhead, ſhould have this peculiar prerogative, to be derived immediately from GOD, before any creature was made.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">§ 5. Contains <hi>a confirmation of this doctrine by arguments drawn from the various advantages of it.</hi> After a full illuſtration of theſe, he ſums them up thus:
<q>There are many dark and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult texts of ſcripture which have puzzled interpreters in ſeveral ages, and which have hung heavy upon the various ſchemes that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the doctrine of the Deity of Chriſt. Now ſuppoſe there could be one ſingle clue found out, which leads us into ſuch a ſolution of all theſe difficulties, and ſuch an interpretation of theſe ſcriptures, which has the following ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages attending it, <hi>viz.</hi>—Which gives the moſt natural and obvious and literal ſenſe, ſo that every common reader that had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived notions or ſchemes of thought, would readily run into at the very hearing of it:—Which puts learned men to no trouble of figures and metaphors, ſuch as <hi>Prolepſes,</hi> i. e. ſpeaking of things before they are done; or <hi>Catachreſes,</hi> i. e. calling the eternal GOD, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Such is the doctrine of the pre-exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the human ſoul of Chriſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the foregoing extracts it is ſufficiently evident what Dr. Watts's ſentiments were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year or two of his death. The reader, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is not to ſuppoſe, that theſe publications were the effect of any ſudden or recent change in his views of theſe doctrines; for it is well known, that he had many years before publicly avowed ſome peculiarity in his manner of conceiving and of expreſſing himſelf with reſpect to them, ſo as
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:025154_0110_0FCE731F29491398"/>
to expoſe himſelf to the cenſures of the more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Trinitarians as favouring hereſy. In his <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> printed ſo early as the year 1722, he diſcovered his inclination to the <hi>Indwelling Scheme,</hi> on account of which Mr. <hi>T. Bradbury,</hi> in a letter 1725, charged him with making
<q>the Divinity of Chriſt to evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a mere attribute,</q>
and after jeering at his profeſſed love of truth, writes to him thus:
<q>It is pity after you have been more than thirty years a teacher of others, you are yet to learn the firſt principles of the oracles of GOD. Was Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s church to be taught another Jeſus? that the Son and Spirit were only two powers in the divine nature?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctor replied with equal gentleneſs and firmneſs, telling Mr. Bradbury, among other things,
<q>That though the Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be a firſt principle, he never knew that the particular mode of explaining it was ſuch a principle alſo.</q>
With reſpect to the charge of deſtroying a trinity of <hi>perſons,</hi> the Doctor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers thus.
<q>I have often freely declared, and ſtill declare, that I allow the greateſt diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion poſſible between the ſacred three in the divine nature, which does not ariſe to three diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct conſcious minds or ſpirits. Make it as great as you will ſhort of this, and I acquieſce. But then ſince three diſtinct conſcious minds is the true idea of three proper literal perſons, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falls ſhort of this can be but an analogic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perſonality; yet if any man will call this a proper divine perſonality, though it is but ſimilar to human perſonality, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about words and names.</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="113" facs="unknown:025154_0111_0FCE7324129B2B18"/>The Doctor, unmoved by the injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections and fierce oppoſition of ſuch of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who were ſlaves to human ſyſtems, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely purſued his enquiries, and the reſult was, that he ſaw further reaſon to be diſſatisfied with the common modes of explaining the Trinity, and he honeſtly declared his different apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions reſpecting it. In the year 1721, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his <hi>Sermons on various Subjects,</hi> in which there is one entitled, <hi>The Scale of Bleſſedneſs; or bleſſed Saints, bleſſed Saviour, and bleſſed Trinity.</hi> On the review of this diſcourſe in the year 1729, he ſaw occaſion to inſert the following Note, (Edition 6th, vol. i. p. 260.)</p>

Since I have ſearched more ſtudiouſly into this myſtery of late, I have learned more of my own ignorance; ſo that when I ſpeak of theſe <hi>unſearchables,</hi> I abate much of my younger aſſurance; nor do my later thoughts venture ſo far into the particular <hi>modes</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining this ſacred diſtinction in the Godhead. There appears to me good reaſon to doubt, whether there can be three diſtinct and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent principles of conſciouſneſs, and three diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and different wills in the One GOD, the one infinite Spirit. I was afraid to aſſert it in this ſermon heretofore, and I am more afraid to aſſert it now. Reaſon and ſcripture join to teach me, that there can be but one GOD, and this GOD is a Spirit.

                  <p>From the above note it is plain, that Dr. Watts had in ſome reſpects altered his views of the ſubject. But ſome have taken occaſion from thence to propagate an idea, that he had entirely given up the orthodox ſaith; whereas nothing more can be juſtly inferred from it, than that he had ſomewhat altered his judgment with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the manner of expreſſing and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Nor does it appear that he materially changed his ſentiments afterwards. The more he enquired into the matter, the more he was confirmed in his opinion with reſpect to the moſt perfect ſimplicity of the divine nature, or oneneſs of the Godhead, and the pre-exiſtence of the derived nature of Chriſt, and at different times he wrote various Eſſays on theſe ſubjects, which he at length, in the two laſt years of his life, reviſed and put together in the two publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of which we have given an account. From theſe, as it is plain he was not an Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, it is equally ſo that he was not either an Arian or a Socinian. It is poſſible however, though not probable, that he might change his
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025154_0113_0FCE7327A5246C40"/>
ſentiments after the publication of the above pieces. That this was actually the caſe has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been confidently aſſerted by a writer in the <hi>Monthly Review,</hi> who mentions ſome reſpectable perſons as having been well acquainted with the fact. We ſhall therefore produce the whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and ſubjoin ſome remarks upon it.</p>

                     <q>That the Doctor had altered his opinion with reſpect to ſome points of what is called <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> is undeniable. This is a ſubject that <hi>ſome</hi> of his encomiaſts ſhrink from with concealed mortification, and would if poſſible conſign to oblivion, as it cannot be remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without bringing ſome reflection either on the Doctor himſelf, or their own darling cauſe. But it would be in vain to deny a fact known to <hi>many</hi> who were intereſted in making it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. It was well known to Dr. Lardner, and by him communicated to the late excellent Mr. <hi>Merrival,</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> from whoſe mouth the writer of the preſent article immediately received it. Dr. Watts's papers (many of which contained the moſt explicit renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of his former ſentiments with reſpect to the doctrine of the Trinity) were mutilated, and publiſhed in a very imperfect manner. Some were <hi>wholly ſuppreſſed,</hi> and it was with difficulty that Dr. Doddridge could

reſcue from deſtruction a certain curious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reſpecting the Trinitarian controverſy, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed among the poſthumous works, entitled <hi>A Solemn Addreſs to the Deity,</hi> &amp;c. The conduct of ſome of Dr. Watts's friends in this caſe was ſo diſingenuous, that it called forth very loud complaints from thoſe who were acquainted with the ſecret: and it was but a ſhort time before Dr. Doddridge embarked for Liſbon that he complained to Mr. Merrival of unfair conduct both with reſpect to Dr. Watts and himſelf, to whoſe charge, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the late Dr. David Jennings, his papers were entruſted for publication.</q>
                  </p>

                           <q>Theſe papers were written at ſeveral ſeaſons and intervals of leiſure, and on various occaſions ariſing through the greateſt part of my life. Many of them were deſigned to be publiſhed among the <hi>Reliquiae Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniles,</hi> but for ſome reaſon or other, not worth preſent notice, were laid by at that time. Whether I ſhall ever publiſh them I know not, though far the greater part of them have ſtood long corrected among my manuſcripts, nor do I ſuppoſe many of them inferior to thoſe Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays and Remarks of this kind which have before appeared in the world with ſome acceptance.

whole of what theſe gentlemen printed, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "the Solemn Addreſs to the Deity," which it is not denied was printed entire. Some of his papers were indeed "ſuppreſſed," which related to the doctrine of the Trinity, but the charge of "diſingenuity" in this matter is groundleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Doctor had by no means enjo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The publiſhers of his works made no ſecret of their having ſuppreſſed theſe papers, but ſay in the Title to his <hi>Addreſs to the Deity,</hi> which was prefixed to them,
<q>that it was not judged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to publiſh them.</q>
There is no proof that they contained a
<q>renunciation of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſentiments:</q>
a gentleman of veracity who had ſeen them aſſured the writer of this, that they appeared to him to contain nothing new, being only a further illuſtration of his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning the Trinity which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore publiſhed to the world, and therefore it might well be thought by his executors
<q>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to publiſh</q>
any thing more upon the ſubject. That this was the real matter of fact appears to be highly credible, and indeed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, from the piece already referred to, which
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025154_0116_0FCE7331013109D8"/>
it is ſaid "Dr. Doddridge with great difficulty reſcued from deſtruction." This piece is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the ſame complexion with what the Doctor had before publiſhed, and therefore moſt undoubtedly that was the caſe with <hi>the other papers which were ſuppreſſed,</hi> to which this was prefixed.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall here tranſcribe it at length, as the beſt anſwer to the above aſſertions of the <hi>Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reviewer,</hi> and at the ſame time as the moſt deciſive proof what the Doctor's laſt ſentiments were on this much diſputed point of Divinity, as well as a pleaſing evidence of his ſeriouſneſs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and impartiality in his ſearch after truth.</p>

                        </gap>hat the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reports of certain perſons, reſpecting his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the orthodox faith, are without foundation. But I muſt take the liberty to ſay, that in the extracts which you have given from his two laſt publications, you have led your readers to entertain an idea that he was entirely in what has been called of late <hi>The Indwelling-Scheme</hi>; that he did not maintain a diſtinction of perſons in the Godhead, but conceived of GOD, as being only one perſon, who is called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that it was this one perſon who dwelt in the man Chriſt Jeſus, in conſequence of which union Chriſt is GOD. Whereas I think you muſt have found, in examining his writings, that he did not deny a three-fold diſtinction in Deity, and that Chriſt had an exiſtence as GOD, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the union of the human nature to the Godhead. For my own part, though I would by no means condemn you and others, who are
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:025154_0126_0FCE73492C8B03E0"/>
in the Indwelling-ſcheme, as heretics, ſince you mean to ſupport the Deity of Chriſt; and I think your ſentiments widely different from Arianiſm or Socinianiſm; yet I muſt confeſs to you that I do not believe this to be the ſcripture repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of the doctrine. And, though I am clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of opinion that our orthodox writers are not to be juſtified, who ſpeak of the Father, Son, and Spirit as three perſons ſo diſtinct from each other as to be <hi>three beings</hi> (which I cannot vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate from the charge of <hi>Tritheiſm</hi>;) yet I do apprehend that there is a three-fold diſtinction in Deity, which juſtifies the term <hi>three perſons,</hi> and that to each of theſe the eſſential attributes of Deity belong. Herein I cannot but think Dr. Watts's opinion coincided with my own, ſo that he was more orthodox than your view of his ſentiments would lead your authors to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

<q>The Son of GOD is ſpoken of in the New Teſtament as a very glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, who was ſome way begotten of the Father, i. e. <hi>derived</hi> from GOD the Father, Vol. II. p. 452. He is conſtituted near to GOD by an unſpeakable union. What joys, what unknown delights poſſeſs the holy ſoul of the man Jeſus! for he is the neareſt <hi>creature</hi> to the bleſſed GOD; for he is one with Godhead.</q>
                           <bibl>Vol. I. p. 250.</bibl>
                        </note> But that he exiſted with the Father before all worlds; (which you, <hi>with the</hi> SOCINIANS, <hi>deny:</hi>) And that the one GOD, the Being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Father</hi> (with reference to Chriſt the <hi>Son</hi>) was ſo united to him, and ſo dwelt in him, that he became <hi>one with God,</hi> and in conſequence of this union he is properly GOD, ſo that at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation GOD <hi>was manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, he does ſometimes allude to the idea of ſome <hi>unknown diſtinctions</hi> in Deity; but at moſt, I conceive, he only means to ſay, he does not know what diſtinctions the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible nature of Godhead may admit of; nor do I. But I cannot find that it was any article of his <hi>faith</hi> that there <hi>are</hi> ſuch <hi>diſtinctions
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025154_0128_0FCE734C5BE6CE98"/>
in the Godhead</hi> as you ſpeak of; on the contrary he maintains that the perſon, or being, united to the man Chriſt Jeſus, was not a <hi>part of Deity</hi> (for ſo I muſt conceive of it if it was not the <hi>whole Godhead</hi>) or an exiſtence ſeparate from the <hi>Father,</hi> but that it was the <hi>Father himſelf.</hi> So that I cannot think that I have given a partial repreſentation of his ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>And now, my good friend, as I am writing to you on this ſubject, I will embrace the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which you have afforded me for enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>What is meant by that three-fold diſtinction in Deity</hi> which you maintain? I have put this queſtion to many who uſe this phraſeology, but could never get a ſatisfactory anſwer. When I have propoſed my difficulties, I have been told
<q>the ſubject is myſterious, and I muſt not pry too inquiſitively into the deep things of GOD.</q>
Now I am willing to remain ignorant of what GOD has not thought fit to reveal. But ſurely revealed truth, may be underſtood, and it cannot be preſumptuous to ſearch into the meaning of it. However, the enquiry in the preſent caſe is not about the divine nature itſelf, but about a mere human form of ſpeech in reſpect to it. And is there any preſumption in aſking a fellow creature, when he uſes language concerning GOD, which I do not underſtand, <hi>What he means by it?</hi> or in ſtating the objections I have to it? With as much propriety might I charge <hi>him</hi> with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in objecting to any phraſeology <hi>of mine,</hi> or deſiring of me an explication of it. Do you expect or wiſh me, good Sir, to adopt any modes of ſpeech, without having ideas to them? Is
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025154_0129_0FCE734DE467A420"/>
this a ſufficient teſt of a perſon's being orthodox? I have always thought orthodoxy to ſignify, not <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> but <hi>thinking right.</hi> For any thing that appears, I think the ſame of GOD as you do. You ſeem to maintain the <hi>Unity of God</hi> in as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute a ſenſe as myſelf, inaſmuch as you deny GOD to be <hi>three beings.</hi> Wherein then do we differ? Were you to tell me freely what ideas you have when you talk of three diſtinctions in Godhead, poſſibly it might appear that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no more than I do, or I might readily fall into your ſentiments. But till you tell me your <hi>meaning</hi> (which ſurely you can do if you have any) I am incapable of making a compariſon between your ſentiments and my own. At preſent, the mode of expreſſion which you adopt appears to me highly exceptionable.</p>
                     <p>I can form no idea of a three-fold diſtinction in Deity but that of <hi>three beings,</hi> or three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent <hi>parts,</hi> which is equally inconſiſtent with the unity, and would imply diviſibility; which I am ſure you would proteſt againſt. I can eaſily conceive of a diſtinction between the <hi>attributes</hi> of GOD. But do you make the Son and Spirit to be only diſtinct <hi>attributes?</hi> If ſo, with what propriety can they be repreſented, and addreſſed, as <hi>perſons?</hi> or how can they ſuſtain different of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and perform different works? or indeed <hi>any at all?</hi> Beſides, if the attributes of GOD be allowed to be perſonified, it will follow that there are as many perſons in GOD as there are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. If the Wiſdom of GOD be called one perſon, and his Power another, his Holineſs may be as juſtly ſtiled a third, his Goodneſs a fourth,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:025154_0130_0FCE73525E3F1290"/>
&amp;c. The attributes of Deity are only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of his nature. Neither of theſe can be properly called GOD, or ſpoken of as <hi>equal</hi> to GOD, who is <hi>the being</hi> to whom they all belong. Moreover, GOD himſelf you muſt allow to be a <hi>being,</hi> and GOD the <hi>Father</hi> you will admit is a <hi>perſon,</hi> in the proper ſenſe of that term, i. e. an intelligent being: but if the Son and Spirit are only attributes of GOD, then they are not equal to him, and conſequently this notion is contrary to the orthodox faith. If you mean that the one GOD ſuſtains <hi>three Characters</hi> or <hi>Relations,</hi> this is intelligible enough, but then it is not <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi>; it is pure <hi>Sabellianiſm.</hi> Beſides GOD ſuſtains more characters and relations than <hi>three,</hi> conſequently, according to this ſcheme, there are more diſtinctions or perſons.<note n="*" place="bottom">If Chriſt <hi>as God</hi> be a diſtinct perſon from the Father, does it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that there are <hi>two perſons</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt? for he was a perſon <hi>as man.</hi> This I know ſome Trinitarians deny, but it is only to ſerve a turn. Muſt it not be a <hi>perſon</hi> who thinks, ſpeaks, acts, ſuffers, and dies? Are not the perſonal pronouns conſtantly applied to Chriſt as man? Do not you often ſpeak of him as acting and ſuffering <hi>as man?</hi> To me nothing can be plainer than that Chriſt as man was a <hi>perſon</hi>; conſequently, unleſs he be two perſons, he is not <hi>as God</hi> a perſon diſtinct from the hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025154_0131_0FCE7353B18CB910"/>
equally preſumptuous in us to <hi>affirm</hi> any thing concerning GOD which he himſelf has not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed. And it is no argument that <hi>there is</hi> this or that property or diſtinction in the divine nature, merely that the contrary cannot be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved. I beſeech you to think whither this would lead us.</p>
                     <p>Our faith, with reſpect to what GOD is, muſt be founded, <hi>not</hi> on what may be ſuppoſed <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and cannot be proved <hi>falſe,</hi> but on what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation clearly aſſerts to be <hi>true.</hi> And to believe any thing concerning the Deity of which we can give no rational account, or to uſe language reſpecting him without ideas, is ſo far from giving him glory, that it is doing him diſhonour.

                  <p>IN the foregoing papers it was attempted to aſcertain what were the laſt ſentiments of the pious and amiable Dr. WATTS on the ſubject of the Trinity. I there endeavoured to prove that, though the Doctor had in ſome reſpects altered his manner of explaining that doctrine, he had by no means given up the doctrine itſelf; that the reports which had been circulated, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his explicit renunciation of his former ſentiments, in the manuſcripts which he had left behind him for publication, were without found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and that the conduct of his executors, which had been ſeverely reprehended, in the ſuppreſſion of ſome of thoſe papers, was fully vindicable.</p>
                  <p>Since the firſt publication of the preceding work, freſh evidence has ariſen on the ſubject, by which my former ſuppoſition is corroborated; and it appears to be ſo full and deciſive as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be now ſubjoined to this work.</p>
                  <p>In a collection of <hi>Letters to and from Dr. Doddridge,</hi> lately publiſhed by the Rev. <hi>Thomas Stedman,</hi> there are ſeveral written by the late Mr. <hi>Neal,</hi> an eminent Attorney, who was one of Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s executors. In one of theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, written juſt after the Doctor's death, dated
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:025154_0133_0FCE7356C7C8EB80"/>
November 29, 1748, is the following account of his Will and his MSS.—"As I know your high eſteem and veneration for Dr. Watts, who has taken his laſt farewel of the abodes of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,—I could not in friendſhip avoid writing you a line to inform you, that the Doctor has made his brother Enoch and myſelf executors of his Will" which bears date July 23, 1746, and contains the following clauſe:—
<q>And as to my manuſcripts of every kind, I give the ſame to Mr. <hi>David Jennings</hi> and Dr. <hi>Philip Doddridge,</hi> in order that they may publiſh ſuch of them, as I ſhall by any paper or memorandum ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my deſire ſhould be publiſhed; and as to the remainder, either to publiſh or ſuppreſs as they ſhall judge beſt.</q>
Mr. Neal adds—
<q>I queſtion whether there are any left which he has ordered to be publiſhed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the beginning of January following, Mr. <hi>Jennings</hi> wrote to Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi> on the ſame ſubject.—"I have waited from day to day in hope of being able to ſend you a catalogue of Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s manuſcripts—but I find Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> does not chuſe to meddle with them juſt at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. When he does you ſhall have immediate notice. I believe we ſhall not have near ſo much trouble in publiſhing the Doctor's manuſcripts as I expected, when he acquainted me with his deſign of committing them in part to my care, which was three or four years ago; for ſince then he has publiſhed moſt of the MSS he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the preſs, ſo that, as I learn from Mr. Parker,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Watts's Amanuenſis.</note> there is little if any thing more remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Jennings</hi> (who ſoon after this received a Doctor's Diploma) adds the following paſſage: "If I ſhould be engaged in drawing up the Doctor's character, I am much obliged to you for the judicious hints you have furniſhed me with for that purpoſe." Mr. <hi>Jennings</hi> (who had preached and printed a funeral ſermon for Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> in which he had drawn a <hi>character</hi> of him) ſeems here to mean, writing his <hi>Life</hi>; which it appears from another letter in this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection he declined, for want of ſufficient mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.

                  <p>From this view of the contents of Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s MSS the impartial reader might be left to judge how far the reports, of the foregoing tract, are deſerving of credit. It may not, however, be amiſs to remark (1) that none of theſe papers were ordered to be publiſhed: (2) that there is nothing in the titles of any of them from whence it appears, with certainty, that the Doctor had materially altered his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſince the publication of his two laſt pieces, which was within two years of his death. (3) It does not appear that he had written any Treatiſe ſince the time that he made his Will, which was in July, 1746. It may be further obſerved— (4) if the Doctor had in any of his laſt papers made
<q>an explicit renunciation of his former ſentiments concerning the Trinity, &amp;c.</q>
with which he was deſirous the public might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted after his deceaſe, it is incredible that he ſhould not have left an expreſs order that ſuch papers ſhould be publiſhed; in which caſe his friends, with whom he had entruſted them, would doubtleſs have brought them to light.</p>

It is much to be wiſhed that they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe who might deſire to inſpect them, though they ſhould not have been thought worthy of publication. The attentive reader, however, who is acquainted with the Doctor's other pieces, may eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, from the foregoing view of his papers, and the phraſeology therein uſed, that they contained much the ſame explanations of the Deity of Chriſt and the Spirit, with thoſe given in the pieces which he himſelf laſt publiſhed. The ſum of which is, that Chriſt is a divine perſon in conſequence of the in-dwelling of the Father, and that the holy Spirit is GOD, as being the power, or active energy of the Deity.</p>
                  <p>That Dr. Watts was firmly in this laſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that on this ground he aſcribed glory to the Spirit, with the Father and the Son, at the end of his prayers, appears abundantly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from a private croreſpondence carried on between him and the Rev.

                  <p>In the courſe of the above tract, Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi> frequently refers to Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s publications, and quotes the conceſſions which he has made— viz.
<q>that there is in ſcripture no expreſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for addreſſing ſuch worſhip to the Spirit, nor any example of it, and that therefore this ought not to be conſidered as a neceſſary part of chriſtian worſhip; though he thought it lawful, becauſe the Spirit or Power of GOD is truly divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and expedient, becauſe the omiſſion of Doxologies to the Spirit would be
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:025154_0139_0FCE73650AA422E8"/>
highly offenſive to ſerious chriſtians who had been accuſtomed to them, and injurious to their edification.</q>
Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi> endeavours to prove,
<q>that addreſſes to the Spirit, in prayer or praiſe, are unlawful and improper, chiefly becauſe we have no warrant for them in the holy ſcripture, which is our only rule of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that no other conſiderations ought to influence us to the practice.</q>
He further endeavours to prove, that,
<q>according to Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s avowed ſentiment concerning the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as not a real perſon, but the power of the Father, aſcriptions of praiſe to the Spirit are highly unjuſtifiable.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The copy of Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi>'s tract, now in my poſſeſſion, contains Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s remarks upon it in the margin, fairly written with his own hand. The following paſſage is extracted as a ſpecimen.</p>

                              <p>TO repeat in brief my ſenſe of this matter, it ſtands thus. The Spirit of any being, in ſcripture-phraſe, is ſometimes uſed for being itſelf, or it denotes its active and operative power. So an unclean or evil ſpirit is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Luke vii.21. Acts xix.15. Matt. x.1. and is called the ſpirit of an unclean devil, Luke iv.33. So the Spirit of GOD ſometimes means GOD himſelf. And further, as the ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of a man and the ſpirit of a beaſt denote, in ſcripture language, the principle of active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in man and beaſt, why may not the Spirit of GOD have the ſame ſignification?</p>
                              <p>

And though GOD the Father and his Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it be the ſame one true GOD, yet they are ſometimes diſtinguiſhed and ſometimes joined. Iſai. xlviii.16. <hi>The Lord God and his Spirit has ſent me.</hi> Even the attributes of GOD are diſtinguiſhed from him and yet coupled with him in ſcripture. Is it not foretold by <hi>Hoſea</hi> concerning the latter days, that men ſhould <hi>fear the Lord and his Goodneſs.</hi> Hoſ. iii.5. Does not <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſay, <hi>bleſſed be the Glory of the Lord,</hi> Ezek. iii.12. Does not Pſal. cv.4. direct us to <hi>ſeek the Lord and his Strength, ſeek his face evermore?</hi> Are not we called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to truſt in his <hi>Mercy,</hi> as well as in GOD himſelf? Why may we not then praiſe the Lord and his goodneſs, or bleſs the Lord and his ſtrength? &amp;c. Why ſhould theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions "ſound ſo oddly" in the ears of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who read thoſe in their bible ſo nearly like them? And why may we not ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord and his Eternal Spirit?</hi> eſpecially ſuppoſing the Spirit of GOD to be ſomething in GOD of greater diſtinction than a mere at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, and to be often repreſented in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a perſonal manner?</p>

                  <p>The Doctor having read to Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi> his remarks, without giving him a copy of them, Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi> wrote a reply at length, from his memory, which makes nearly two ſheets of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in a ſmall hand, which I have now before me. It is dated April 21, 1738. In this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr. <hi>Tomkins,</hi> with great freedom and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtates his objections to what the Doctor had advanced in favour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Spirit, and endeavours to ſhew, that his motive for it, upon which he lays ſo much ſtreſs, (viz. the avoiding of offence to many ſerious chriſtians) was inſufficient, and that by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this matter, he led them to conceive of his ſentiments concerning the Spirit to be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from what they were, and encouraged them in worſhipping the Spirit as a real perſon diſtinct from the Father.</p>
                  <p>At the cloſe of the letter Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his mind with freedom about Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s Doxologies in his Book of Hymns. I ſhall quote this paſſage for the ſake of gratifying the reader with the Doctor's reply, which will ſerve to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate and confirm what I had before obſerved, with reſpect to a report of the Doctor's having left a corrected copy of his Hymn-book, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for publication.
<q>My chief aim (ſays Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi>) in all I do upon this ſubject is, the reſtoring the chriſtian worſhip to its primitive purity, and freeing it from what I cannot but look upon as an unwarrantable innovation. And for this purpoſe I would make bold to proceed one ſtep farther, and aſk, whether you now approve of what you have ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> in your Book of Hymns; and whether, upon your preſent notion of the Spirit, you can eſteem ſome of thoſe Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies you have given us there, I will not ſay, <hi>as ſome of the nobleſt parts of chriſtian worſhip,</hi> [the Doctor's words] but as proper chriſtian worſhip? And if not, whether you may not think it becoming you, as a lover of truth, and as a chriſtian miniſter, to declare as much
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:025154_0142_0FCE736A4C84DD50"/>
to the world; and not ſuffer ſuch forms of worſhip to be recommended by your name and authority, to the uſe of the chriſtian church in the preſent time and in future generations?</q>

                  <p>In the margin of this long epiſtle of Mr. <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> are contained Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s remarks, which are upwards of twenty. Oppoſite to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his laſt paragraph the Doctor writes thus:
<q>I freely anſwer, I wiſh ſome things were corrected. But the queſtion with me is this: as I wrote them in ſincerity at that time, is it not more for the edification of chriſtians, and the glory of GOD, to let them ſtand, than to ruin the uſefulneſs of the whole book, by correcting them now, and perhaps bring further and falſe ſuſpicions on my preſent opinions? Beſides, I might tell you, that of all the books I have written, that particular copy is not mine. I ſold it for a trifle to Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> near thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ago, and his poſterity make money of it to this day, and I can ſcarce claim a right to make any alteration in the book which would injure the ſale of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It appears that Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> communicated to Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi> his remarks upon his letter, which produced another from him, dated, <hi>Hackney,</hi> July 5, 1738, on which there is only this one marginal note of the Doctor's.
<q>Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi>'s confeſſion of my Doxology to the H. S. to be lawful, yet not neceſſary.</q>
In this letter, which contains nearly a ſheet in ſmall writing, Mr. <hi>Tomkins,</hi> though he grants that the Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy which Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> uſed, was not in itſelf unlawful, ſtrongly objects to the propriety of it,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:025154_0143_0FCE736BAD022010"/>
and to the principle on which the Doctor plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, that of complying with the prejudices of many ſerious people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I do ſtill alſo differ from you as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of offence—nor can I recollect any thing in the practice or directions of the apoſtles that gives the leaſt countenance to ſuch a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
With regard to the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> in the Doctor's Hymns, he adds,
<q>I can by no means approve of your excuſe for letting thoſe Doxologies in your Book of Hymns (which you own you do not now approve of, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per chriſtian worſhip) ſtand recommended by your name and authority, to the uſe of the preſent church and of future generations. May not chriſtians edify by what is ſcriptural in that book, notwithſtanding your renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing or retracting what you now apprehend to be unſcriptural? Or if ſome weak perſons might, by that means, be prevented from reaping the advantage which otherwiſe they might do by your Hymns, will you, for the ſake of that, recommend to the church the making uſe of what you yourſelf judge to be, at beſt, unintelligible ſounds, in their ſolemn acts of worſhip; recommend it to them as <hi>one of the nobleſt parts of chriſtian worſhip?</hi> Let us not do evil that good may come of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After ſaying ſomething on the different opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of different perſons concerning his <hi>Calm En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> he concludes the correſpondence thus.</p>

                  <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
                  <p>ON a review of this publication ſo far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s notion of the Trinity, (which I confeſs it was a leading object with me to bring forward) I can eaſily imagine that ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent readers will be diſſatisfied, and will think his ſcheme liable to equal objections with other ſchemes. I do not apprehend that it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on me to defend it, nor am I ſanguine in my opinion that it is the true one; though I confeſs that in the main it appears to me at preſent to be nearer the truth than that commonly received
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:025154_0145_0FCE737119FAE100"/>
as orthodox, which maintains three <hi>real perſons,</hi> or diſtinct intelligent beings, in the Godhead. If I am miſtaken I ſhould be truly glad to be better informed. <hi>Errare poſſum, Haereticus eſſe nolo.</hi> As I can have no intereſt to ſerve in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any article of ſound doctrine, neither have I any pleaſure in diſſenting from popular opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, or modes of ſpeech. I am fully perſuaded, however, that the mode of explication here brought to view is not ſo eſſentially different from ſome others which have been uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed to be orthodox, as ſome perſons ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. All that I here intend is to offer a few obſervations in proof of this for the ſatisfaction of ſerious chriſtians, who have imbibed an early prejudice in favour of long eſtabliſhed ſyſtems, and certain human modes of ſpeech, and who may be alarmed under a ſuſpicion (which certain perſons of better information have taken pains to promote) that my deſign is, to promote <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm</hi> or <hi>Arianiſm:</hi> terms of reproach which too many (and ſome without underſtanding their meaning) are ever ready to apply to ſuch as ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to think for themſelves, and to adopt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage different from that which human creeds have ſtamped as ſacred, though the moſt remote from the language of the Bible. If ſuch will be attentive in reading, and candid in judging, I hope to convince them, whether they fall in with my mode of explanation or not, that I have <hi>done nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>'s view of the preſent ſubject—
<q>The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, are the one living and true GOD.</q>
To
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:025154_0146_0FCE73731C8EF190"/>
this propoſition I give my ready aſſent. And whoever does ſo, whatever be his peculiar mode of explication, I will maintain has as juſt a claim to the character of ORTHODOX, as they who do it in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> ſenſe. And for any, who adopt that or any other mode of explication, to monopolize ORTHODOXY to themſelves, is a degree of preſumption unbecoming fallible creatures, eſpecially thoſe who allow that the MODE of ſubſiſtence in the Sacred Three is not aſcertained in ſcripture; and, indeed, it is inconſiſtent with the avowed Catholiciſm of the ableſt and beſt writers who are the moſt partial to the general Calviniſtic ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the idea of PERSONAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ITY, as applicable to the Father, Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> differed from many Trinitarians, as he denied (and I think with very ſufficient reaſon)
<q>that there are in Deity three infinite Spirits, or really diſtinct perſons, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of that term, each having a diſtinct intelligence, volition, power, &amp;c.</q>
Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a ſuppoſition inconſiſtent with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per UNITY of the Godhead; which is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs one of the moſt obvious and fundamental doctrines of revelation.</p>
                  <p>But it is to be remembered, that with regard to the definition of <hi>perſonality,</hi> Trinitarians wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ among themſelves. While ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be REAL, others think it only MODAL, or nominal, and others ſomewhat between both. Some of the two latter claſſes have charged the former with <hi>Tritheiſm</hi>; and to me it ſeems dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to clear the <hi>doctrine</hi> from the imputation.
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:025154_0147_0FCE737408B5E778"/>
Nor can I conceive what Tritheiſm is, if this hypotheſis does not come under the deſcription. To aſſert a mere UNITY of ESSENCE or NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE will not obviate the difficulty: for three divine perſons, or beings, though of the ſame nature, or in other words—all of them EXACT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY ALIKE, (which ſeems to be the meaning of the term, and is the popular idea) would be as really three GODS, as three human perſons of the ſame nature, were they in all reſpects alike, would be three men. Such a ſentiment, I think, ought to be zealouſly oppoſed as heretical.</p>
                  <p>I grant, however, ſince they who maintain this doctrine do not ſee the conſequence, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſclaim it, and profeſs to believe in only ONE GOD, whom they worſhip as one infinite being, through one mediator; it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candid and unjuſt to pronounce them <hi>Tritheiſis,</hi> and in my idea it would be ſchiſmatical, for this reaſon alone, to ſeparate from their worſhip and communion. Many ſuch, whom I have known, I venerate as the excellent of the earth. And whatever peculiar modes of ſpeech they may adopt <hi>in controverſy,</hi> their language, and apparent ideas, when engaged in divine <hi>worſhip,</hi> are ſuch, that in uniting with them I literally comply with the apoſtolic injunction, Rom. xv.6. <hi>With one mind and one mouth to glorify God, even the Fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then on the ſame principles I muſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thoſe Trinitarians as violating the laws of chriſtian candour, who upbraid ſuch as hold the ſame general doctrine, with the oppoſite hereſy, and refuſe to hold communion with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:025154_0148_0FCE737576C531C8"/>
on ſuch a controverted matter as that of <hi>perſonality,</hi> they expreſs themſelves differently, and chuſe to adhere to the ſimplicity of ſcripture language. This is particularly unbecoming in thoſe who adopt the <hi>modal ſcheme,</hi> ſince the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them and the followers of <hi>Watts</hi> can be but ſmall.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe who think perſonality in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to be <hi>ſomewhat between a perſon and a mode,</hi> if there be any rational idea included in the term, they who conſider
<q>the <hi>manifeſt Wiſdom,</hi> and the <hi>Active Energy</hi> of Deity, as the WORD and the HOLY GHOST,</q>
may with good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of reaſon be admitted as coming within the ſame deſcription.—And they who talk of <hi>three diſtinctions</hi> in Deity, without any definition of the term, have little reaſon to cenſure ſuch as in fact equally maintain three diſtinctions, but with a determinate meaning.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe who uſe the common Trinitarian language in the SABELLIAN ſenſe (which upon a cloſe enquiry I have found to be the caſe with ſome, and have reaſon to think it ſo with many) they have little reaſon to cry out "hereſy" at the mode of interpretation for which I am here apologizing.</p>
                  <p>That it ſhould, by any, be ſtigmatized with the name either of SOCINIANISM or ARIAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ISM, appears to me peculiarly uncandid and unjuſt. The <hi>Anti-Nicene</hi> Fathers evidently adopted this hypotheſis. And if I underſtand the great reformer <hi>Calvin</hi> aright, he in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conceived of the WORD and SPIRIT of GOD as the WISDOM and POWER of Deity
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:025154_0149_0FCE7377AA53A5C8"/>
PERSONIFIED. The pious Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a like perſonification, and ſeverely reproves thoſe orthodox men who anathematize them that eſpouſe ſuch a mode of explaining the Trinity.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Baxter</hi>'s works, vol. ii. p. 132. Where, though he ſays that he "accounts the doctrine of the Trinity the ſum and kernel of the Chriſtian religion, and the <hi>Athanaſian Creed</hi> the beſt explication of it," he pleads "for the notion of "three eſſential principles," and after illuſtrating the matter by various objects in nature, he obſervs that "the ſcripture often calls Chriſt the <hi>Wiſdom of God,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (<hi>Logos</hi>) is both <hi>Ratio</hi> (reaſon) and <hi>Oratio</hi> (ſpeech). And that ſome think the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers means <hi>Love to God,</hi> &amp;c. He then adds the following paſſage:
<q>Abundance of Heretics have troubled the church with their ſelf-deviſed opinions about the Trinity, and the perſon and nature of Chriſt. And I am loth to ſay, how much many of the <hi>orthodox</hi> have troubled it alſo, with their ſelf-conceited, miſguided, uncharitable zeal, againſt thoſe whom they judged Heretics.—I would adviſe the reader to be none of them that ſhall charge with hereſy all thoſe who ſay that the three perſons are <hi>Deus ſeipſum intelligens. Deus a ſcipſo intellectus, et Deus a ſeipſo amatus</hi> (tho I am not one) nor yet thoſe holy men whom I have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,—and many others, who expreſsly ſay, that <hi>Potentia, Sapientia, et Amor,</hi> (Power, Wiſdom, and Love) are the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</q>
                     </note> Certain it is that <hi>Socinians</hi> reject ſuch kind of language, and diſavow the notion of a Trinity in any form; not now to ſay any thing of the <hi>atonement,</hi> which they univerſally deny, but which thoſe I am defending as ſtrenuouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Arians,</hi> properly ſo called, if I have any idea of their ſentiments, they conſider the <hi>Logos</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> as CREATED BEINGS; which I think, with Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> is an error, moſt manifeſtly repugnant to ſcripture-doctrine.</p>
                  <p>It is true, Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> maintained the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> to have been a created being. But if on that account his followers are juſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with hereſy, I know not who will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt; for I ſuppoſe all will allow that Chriſt was properly MAN, and as ſuch created. Some,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:025154_0150_0FCE737BCC20C838"/>
indeed, maintain that he was a human PERSON, as really as any other man is ſo; and on this ground deny that his <hi>Divinity</hi> was a <hi>real perſon,</hi> diſtinct from that of the Father (for otherwiſe there would be TWO PERSONS in Chriſt;) while others ſtrangely and arbitrarily ſuppoſe (to avoid this laſt abſurdity) that the method of Chriſt was merely a created NATURE. But both allow
<q>the Deity of Chriſt to conſiſt in the union of the Godhead, and the manhood, in the perſon of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> ſo that in him <hi>GOD was manifeſt in the fleſh.</hi>

This general agreement I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as all that is eſſential to true orthodoxy, and a ſufficient bond of union. How much farther chriſtian charity may ſafely extend, it is not my preſent buſineſs to enquire. I will only obſerve, that they who have inveſtigated ſubjects of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal controverſy with the greateſt care and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, will be the moſt ready to confeſs, that there are difficulties on all ſides, where the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has not explicitly decided; and will ſee the greateſt reaſon for diffidence of themſelves, and candour towards one another. Theſe are two principal leſſons which I have learned from the ſtudy of more than thirty years, and theſe I am principally ſolicitous to inculcate upon others. If this publication ſhould in any degree contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to anſwer this end, I ſhall be thankful, even though it ſhould expoſe me to the cenſures of ſome good men to whoſe eſteem I am by no means indifferent, though their charity is much more confined than my own; and whom, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may think or ſay of me, I will love and honour.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE family from which Dr. Doddridge deſcended appears to have been originally ſettled in Devonſhire. No memoirs of it, however, are capable of being traced farther back than to his great grandfather, whoſe name was Richard, and who was an eminent merchant at Barnſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in that county. Of his great grandfather we are not told whether he was a gentleman who lived upon his eſtate, or whether he was of any particular profeſſion. That the family was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, is evinced by its arms; and that it was of ſome conſequence, is apparent from the liberal education, and the reſpectable ſituations, of ſuch of the members of it as have not been conſigned

to oblivion. John Doddridge, brother of the Doctor's great grandfather, was of no ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in the law; paſſed through ſeveral em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent ſtages of it, in the reign of King James the Firſt; received the honour of knighthood; and at length roſe to be one of the Judges of the Court of King's Bench. An account of him will be given below.<note n="*" place="bottom">This John Doddridge, one of the ſons of the Richard Doddridge above mentioned, was born at Barnſtaple, in the year 1555. In 1572 he was entered of Exeter College, Oxford, where he ſtudied four years, after which he was removed to the Middle Temple, London, where he became a great proficient in the law, and a noted counſellor. In the forty-fifth year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, he was Lent Reader of that houſe; and on the twentieth of January 1603-4, he was called to the degree of Serjeant at Law. At the ſame time he had the honour of being appointed Serjeant to Henry Prince of Wales. From this employment he was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the ſucceeding year, to be Sollicitor-General to the King; though his name does not occur, under that capacity, in Mr. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atſon's Political Index. On the twenty-fifth of June, 1607, he was conſtituted his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Principal Serjeant at Law, and was knighted on the fifth of July following. In February 1612-13, he was created Maſter of Arts, at his chambers in Serjeants' Inn, by the Vice Chancellor, the two Proctors, and five other members of the Univerſity of Oxford. This peculiar honor was conferred upon him in gratitude for the great ſervice he had done to the Univerſity, in ſeveral law-ſuits depending between the city of Oxford and the ſaid Univerſity. On the twenty-ſecond of April, 1613, Sir John Doddridge was appointed one of the Judges of the Court of King's Bench, in which office he continued till his death. In this ſtation he appears to have conducted himſelf with great integrity as well as ability. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in April, 1628, he and the other Judges of the court were called upon to aſſign their reaſons in the Houſe of Lords, for having given judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt admitting five gentlemen to bail, who had been impriſoned for refuſing the loan which had lately been demanded by the crown. Sir Nicholas Hyde, Lord Chief Juſtice, Sir John Doddridge, Mr. Juſtice Jones, and Mr. Juſtice Whitlocke, each of them ſpoke upon the occaſion, and made the beſt defence which the nature of the caſe would admit. If they were guilty of a miſtake, which cannot now reaſonably be doubted, they ſeem to have been led into it in the ſincerity of their hearts, from the high notions they entertained of regal power. Sir John Doddridge, in his ſpeech, aſſerts the purity of his own character in the following terms:
<q>It is no more fit for a Judge to decline to give an account of his doings, than for a Chriſtian of his faith. GOD knoweth I have endeavoured always to keep a good conſcience; for a troubled one who can bear? I have now ſat in this court fifteen years, and I ſhould know ſomething. Surely, if I had gone in a mill ſo long, duſt would cleave to my clothes. I am old, and have one foot in the grave; therefore I will look to the better part as near as I can. But <hi>omnia habere in memoria, et in nullo errare, divinum potius eſt quam humanum.</hi>
                  </q>
Sir John Doddridge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life on the thirteenth day of September, 1628, in the ſeventy-third year of his age, and was buried in the ambulatory before the door of the library formerly called Lady Mary's Chapel, in the cathedral church of Exeter. Within that library is a very ſumptuous monument erected to his memory, containing his figure and that of his wife, cut in alabaſter, under a ſtately arch ſupported by marble pillars. This learned Judge, by his happy education, accompanied with excellent natural parts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitted induſtry, became ſo general a ſcholar, that it was ſaid of him, that it was difficult to determine whether he were the better Artiſt, Divine, civil or common Lawyer. Among his other ſtudies, he was a great lover of antiquities, and attained to ſuch an eminence of knowledge and ſkill in that department of literature, that he was regarded as one of the ableſt members of the famous Society of Antiquaries, which may be ſaid to have begun in 1571, but which more particularly flouriſhed from 1590 to 1614. The following works were written by Sir John Doddridge. 1. "The Lawyer's Light, or due Direction for the Study of the Law." London, 1629, quarto. 2. "A complete Parſon, or a Deſcription of Advowſons and Church Livings, delivered in ſeveral Readings, in an Inn of Chancery called the New Inn." Printed 1602, 1603, 1630, quarto. 3. "The Hiſtory of the Ancient and Modern Eſtate of the Principality of Wales, Duchy of Cornwall, and Earldom of Cheſter." 1630, quarto. 4. "The Engliſh Lawyer, a Treatiſe deſcribing a Method for the managing of the Laws of this Land, and expreſſing the beſt Qualities requiſite in the Student, Practiſer, Judges, &amp;c." London, 1631, quarto. 5. "Opinion touching the Antiquity, Power, Order, State, Manner, Perſons, and Proceedings, of the High Courts of Parliament in England." London, 1658, octavo. 6. "A Treatiſe of particular Eſtates." London, 1677, duodecimo. Printed at the end of the fourth edition of William Noy's Works, entitled, "The Ground and Maxims of the Law." 7. "A true Repreſentation of fore-paſſed Parliaments to the View of the preſent Times and Poſterity." This ſtill remains in manuſcript. Sir John Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge alſo enlarged a book called the "Magazine of Honour;" Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, 1642. The ſame book was afterwards publiſhed under his name by the Title of "The Law of Nobility and Peerage;" London, 1657, 1658, octavo. In the Collection of curious Diſcourſes written by eminent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries, are two Diſſertations by our Judge; one of which is on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of the Land of England, and the other on the Office and Duty of Herald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our author's grandfather, whoſe name was John, was educated for the church, in the Univerſity of Oxford, and was poſſeſſed of the rectory of Sheperton, in the county of Middleſex, from which he was ejected on the twenty-fourth of Auguſt, 1662, in conſequence of the act of uniformity. At that time he had ten children unprovided for; notwithſtanding which, he quitted a benefice that was worth two hundred pounds a year, rather than he would violate his conſcience, by ſubmitting to the ſubſcriptions and declarations required, and the uſages impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that act.

            <p>Daniel Doddridge, the Doctor's father, was brought up to trade, and ſettled as an oilman, in the city of London. Being the eldeſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving branch of the family, he was heir at law to the large eſtate of the Judge (about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year) and was often urged by his friends to purſue the recovery of it, but he choſe to decline doing it, from an apprehenſion of the hazard and expenſe that would attend the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. He had a great number of children, all of whom died young, excepting one daughter, and our author. The Doctor was the laſt and twentieth child of his father's marriage. His mother was the daughter of the Reverend Mr. John Bauman, of Prague in Bohemia; who, in conſequence of the troubles which followed the expulſion of Frederic, Elector Palatine, left his native country about the year 1626. Such was his adherence to the Proteſtant religion, that, for the ſake of enjoying the free exerciſe of it, he quitted all his friends, and the poſſeſſion of a conſiderable eſtate. He withdrew, on foot, in the habit of a peaſant, carrying with him nothing but a hundred broad pieces of gold, plaited in a leathern girdle, <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Bauman, the firſt night after he commenced his journey, left his girdle behind him at the inn in which he lay; and not being uſed to ſuch a cincture, he did not miſs it till he came to another inn the next evening. Upon this he immediately went back to his former lodgings, with the united painful apprehenſion of being met by purſuers, and of not having the good fortune to recover his ſubſtance. When he arrived at the inn, he enquired of the chambermaid if ſhe had ſeen a girdle which he had left in his chamber. She informed him that ſhe had ſeen it, but that, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be of no value, ſhe had thrown it away, and could not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect where. After having told her that he had a great value for his old belt, that it would be very uſeful to him in the long journey he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and that he would handſomely reward her for finding it, ſhe ſearched diligently, and at length found it in a hole under the ſtairs, where the family uſed to throw their worn out uſeleſs furniture. The good man received his girdle with great joy, and purſued his journey with thankfulneſs to Providence for the recovery. This event he often ſpoke of to his friends, as an extraordinary and ſeaſonable mercy.<note n="†" place="bottom">

Having ſpent ſome time at Saxe-Gotha, and in other parts of Germany, he came to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in what year is uncertain, with ample teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonials from many of the principal German divines. Being thus ſtrongly recommended, he was made Maſter of the Free School at King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton-upon-Thames, at which place he died, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him one only child, the daughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, then very young.</p>
            <p>Dr. Philip Doddridge was born in London, on the twenty-ſixth of June, 1702. So deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was he, at his birth, of the ſigns of life, that he was thrown aſide as dead. One, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of the attendants, thinking that ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome motion or breath in him, cheriſhed with ſuch aſſiduous care the almoſt expiring flame of exiſtence, that it was happily preſerved, for the benefit of the world. From his infancy young Doddridge had an infirm conſtitution, and a thin conſumptive habit, which rendered both himſelf and his friends apprehenſive that his life would be ſhort. He frequently was accuſtomed therefore, eſpecially on the returns of his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:025154_0157_0FCE738A83310058"/>
to expreſs his wonder and gratitude that his years were ſo long continued. His parents, whoſe character was worthy of their birth and education, brought him up in the early know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of religion. Before he could read, his mother taught him the hiſtory of the Old and New Teſtament, by the aſſiſtance of ſome Dutch tiles in the chimney of the room where they uſually ſat; and accompanied her inſtructions with ſuch wiſe and pious reflections, as made ſtrong and laſting impreſſions upon his heart. His firſt initiation in the learned languages was under Mr. Scott, a miniſter, who kept a private ſchool in London. In 1712, when he was ten years of age, he was removed to Kingſton-upon-Thames, and placed at the ſchool which had been taught by his grandfather Bauman. Here he continued till 1715, and diſtinguiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his piety and his diligent application to literature. On the ſeventeenth of July, in the ſame year, he had the unhappineſs of loſing his father; and he had been deprived of his mother ſometime before. This circumſtance, of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left an orphan, excited in him very ſerious reflections, which, however, were not wholly of a gloomy nature; for he expreſſed a devout, and even a cheerful truſt in the protection of the GOD of Mercies, the univerſal Parent of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>About the time of his father's death, Mr. Doddridge quitted Kingſton, and was removed to a private ſchool at St. Alban's, under the care of a worthy and learned maſter, Mr. Nathaniel Wood. At this town he had not only the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:025154_0158_0FCE738D3A9471D8"/>
of receiving excellent inſtruction, but was peculiarly happy in forming an acquaintance with a gentleman to whom he owed the higheſt obligations, and who behaved to him with the kindneſs of a parent. The gentleman we ſpeak of was Mr. (afterwards Dr.) Samuel Clark, the diſſenting miniſter of the place. What rendered Mr. Clark's regard and protection particularly ſeaſonable, was a calamity that befell Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge with reſpect to his private fortune. By the miſmanagement of the perſon into whoſe hands the care of his affairs had been entruſted after his father's death, he loſt the whole of his ſubſtance. In this melancholy ſituation, he found a ready benefactor in Mr. Clark; and had not Providence raiſed him up ſuch a generous friend, he could not have proceeded in the courſe of his ſtudies.</p>
            <p>During Mr. Doddridge's reſidence at St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban's, he began to keep a diary of his life; from which it appears how diligently he improved his time, and how anxious he was to be daily advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in knowledge, piety, virtue, and uſefulneſs. As he had the chriſtian miniſtry in view, beſides his application to the languages, he read, every morning and evening, portions of ſcripture, with ſome commentary upon them; and it was very ſeldom indeed, that he permitted either his ſchool buſineſs, or any avocations or amuſements, to divert him from this courſe. He recorded the ſubſtance and deſign of the ſermons he heard, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the impreſſions which they made upon him, and particularly noted what was moſt worthy of imitation in the preacher. In theſe
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:025154_0159_0FCE738E2CAAEBD8"/>
important concerns he had the ſingular felicity of enjoying the direction of ſo kind and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a friend as Mr. Clark. Under the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by the encouragement of the ſame gentleman, he was admitted to the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and his own reflections on the occaſion, preſerved in his diary, amply ſhew the ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſpirit in that early part of life:</p>
            <p>In the year 1718, Mr. Doddridge left the ſchool at St. Alban's, and retired for a time, to his ſiſter's houſe,<note n="*" place="bottom">His ſiſter was married to Mr. John Nettleton, a diſſenting miniſter at Ongar, in Eſſex. She was a lady diſtinguiſhed by her good ſenſe and piety, and by the patience and tranquillity with which ſhe bore ſome heavy afflictions. Her brother always behaved to her with the utmoſt tenderneſs; and even while at the academy, and in his firſt ſettlement, generouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed all that he could ſpare out of his ſmall ſtock for her aſſiſtance.<note n="†" place="bottom">

Whilſt he was in this ſtate of ſuſpence, the Duch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of Bedford, who had a regard for his family, hearing of his ſituation and character, and of his warm inclination to ſtudy, made him an offer, that, if he choſe to be educated for the church of England, and would go to either of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, ſhe would ſupport the expenſes of his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and afterwards provide for him, if ſhe ſhould live, till he had taken orders. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal he received with the higheſt gratitude, but declined it in the moſt reſpectful manner, as he could not ſatisfy his conſcience in complying with the terms of miniſterial conformity. In

the diſtreſs of his mind, from an apprehenſion that he ſhould not be able to accompliſh what was ſo near to his heart, he waited upon Dr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Calamy, a divine of great eminence among the diſſenters at that period, and entreated his advice and aſſiſtance towards his being brought up for the miniſtry. But in this application he met with no encouragement. The Doctor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diſſuade him from his deſign, and urged him to betake himſelf to ſome other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Diſheartened by ſo many obſtructions and difficulties, he at length entertained thoughts of entering upon the ſtudy of the law, in which deſign he was encouraged by Mr. Horſeman, a celebrated conveyancer, who recommended him to Mr. Eyre, a counſellor, from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch good propoſals, that he was on the point of complying with them. However, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to his final determination, he devoted one morning ſolemnly to ſeek to GOD for direction; and whilſt he was actually engaged in this pious exerciſe, the poſtman knocked at the door with a letter from Mr. Clark, containing an offer to take him under his care, if he choſe the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try upon Chriſtian principles. With what thankfulneſs he embraced the offer, will appear from his own words in his diary. <q>This, ſays he,
I look upon almoſt as an anſwer from heaven; and, while I live, ſhall always adore ſo ſeaſonable an interpoſition of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. I have ſought GOD's direction in all this matter, and I hope I have had it. My only view in my choice hath been that of more extenſive ſervice; and I beg GOD would

            </p>
            <p>Mr. Doddridge returned to St. Alban's, in conſequence of Mr. Clark's propoſal, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome months at the houſe of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous friend, who directed him in his ſtudies, furniſhed him with proper books, and laboured to cheriſh religious diſpoſitions and views in his heart. In October, 1719, he was placed under the tuition of the Reverend John Jennings, who kept an academy at Kibworth, in Leiceſterſhire, and was a gentleman of great learning, piety, and uſefulneſs. Mr. Jennings was the author of "Two Diſcourſes on Preaching Chriſt, and particular and experimental Preaching," firſt printed in 1723, which were ſo much eſteemed that they were recommended by two Biſhops at their viſitations of their clergy, and tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the German language, by order of Dr. Frank, Profeſſor of Divinity at Hall, in Saxony. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond edition of them appeared in 1736, under the care of Mr. Jennings's brother, Dr. David Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, who was for many years an eminent min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter and tutor in London. Mr. John Jennings publiſhed likewiſe, "A genealogical table of the Kings of England, Scotland, and France, for the ſpace of nine hundred years." Under the tuition of this gentleman, for whom Mr. Doddridge had the higheſt veneration and reſpect, he proſecuted his ſtudies with the greateſt ardour and diligence.

<pb n="164" facs="unknown:025154_0162_0FCE7392A8C86A18"/>
for the farther illuſtration of the ſubjects treated upon, he had in one half year read ſixty books, and about as many more afterwards in the ſame proportion of time. Some of theſe were large volumes, ſuch as Patrick's Commentaries, Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon's Works, and moſt of the ſermons that had been preached at Boyle's Lecture. All the reſt were learned or uſeful treatiſes. Nor was it in a haſty or deſultory manner that theſe books were read by him, but with great attention and cloſe ſtudy. Several of them he abridged; and from others he made extracts, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in his common-place book; and when he found, in any of the works peruſed by him, a remarkable interpretation or illuſtration of a text of ſcripture, he transferred it into his interleaved Teſtament or Bible.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, 12—14.</note>

            <p>It was of eminent advantage to Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge, that, during the whole of his academical courſe, he enjoyed the correſpondence of Mr. Clark. From ſuch of this gentleman's letters as have ſtill been preſerved, it appears that his advices to his young friend, whether regarding his religious or literary improvements, were ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally wiſe and judicious.<note n="†" place="bottom">Letters to and from the Rev. Philip Doddridge, D. D. p. 1—14</note> It was probably in conformity with the exhortations of Mr. Clark, that Mr. Doddridge made it his buſineſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his acquaintance with claſſical learning. The more immediate objects of his attention were the Greek writers. Theſe he not only read with care, but wrote obſervations upon them, for the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of the authors themſelves, or of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:025154_0163_0FCE739640E17AA8"/>
and he ſelected ſuch paſſages as might be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to him in his preparations for the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. His remarks upon Homer, in particular, were ſo numerous, that they would make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable volume.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>4.</note> This part of Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's conduct is juſtly entitled to commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By forming his taſte upon the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of antiquity, to which he added an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the polite writers of his own country, he acquired an eaſe and elegance of ſtile which he would not otherwiſe have attained. His me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was the greater in this reſpect, as few of the diſſenters had hitherto cultivated the graces of compoſition, and perhaps not many of them had excelled even in the perſpicuity and correctneſs of their language. It is deſirable that the cauſe of truth, piety, and virtue, ſhould come recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended with every poſſible advantage.</p>
            <p>While Mr. Doddridge was thus laying up a large ſtore of ſolid and ornamental knowledge, he was equally intent upon cultivating the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the chriſtian character. For this purpoſe he drew up ſome rules for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his temper and conduct, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the beginning of his interleaved New Teſtament, that, by a frequent review of them, they might have the greater influence on the whole of his behaviour. They are very ſtrict; and perhaps more ſtrict than can ordinarily and univerſally be put into practice; but the effect of them was happy on himſelf, and an attention to them might be ſignally uſeful to others, who
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:025154_0164_0FCE73989E588A18"/>
have the ſame views in life.<note n="*" place="bottom">They may be ſeen in Orton's Memoirs, p. 16— 18.</note> In the year 1722, Mr. Jennings removed, with his pupils, from Kibworth to Hinckley, at which place Mr. Doddridge, after having been previouſly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a committee of miniſters, and received an ample teſtimonial to his qualifications, preached his firſt ſermon. This was on the twenty-ſecond of July in that year. As he was but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than twenty years of age, his friend Mr. Clark ſeemed rather apprehenſive that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to preach too ſoon; but he acquieſced in the judgment of his tutor, grounded on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of Mr. Doddridge's abilities.<note n="†" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 20. Doddridge's Letters, p. 7.</note> From his firſt appearance in the pulpit, he was remarkably acceptable in the places where he exerciſed his talents. After continuing to purſue his ſtudies another year, he accepted of an invitation from the congregation of Diſſenters at Kibworth. At the ſame time he had an application from the city of Coventry, to be Aſſiſtant to Mr. Warren. Mr. Clark gave the preference to the laſt offer, for ſeveral judicious reaſons; notwithſtanding which, Mr. Doddridge, upon mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made choice of the former ſituation. His principal motives for ſo doing were his youth, and the opportunity of purſuing his ſtudies with little interruption. It was in June 1723, that he ſettled at Kibworth. As the congregation was ſmall, and he lived in an obſcure village, he could devote almoſt his whole time to the farther acquiſition of knowledge and learning; and this he did with indefatigable zeal. Soon after his
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:025154_0165_0FCE73997A935C80"/>
ſettlement at Kibworth, one of his fellow-pupils having condoled with him, in a letter, on his being buried alive, he returned the following ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſpirited anſwer:
<q>Here I ſtick cloſe to thoſe delightful ſtudies which a favourable Providence has made the buſineſs of my life. One day paſſeth away after another, and I only know that it paſſeth pleaſantly with me. As for the world about me, I have very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with it. I live almoſt like a tortoiſe, ſhut up in its ſhell, almoſt always in the ſame town, the ſame houſe, the ſame chamber. Yet I live like a prince; not indeed in the pomp of greatneſs, but the pride of liberty; maſter of my books, maſter of my time, and, I hope I may add, maſter of myſelf. I can willingly give up the charms of London, the luxury, the company, and the popularity of it, for the ſecret pleaſures of rational employment and ſelf-approbation; retired from applauſe and reproach, from envy and contempt, and the deſtructive baits of avarice and ambition. So that, inſtead of lamenting it as my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, you ſhould congratulate me upon it as my happineſs, that I am confined to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure village; ſeeing it gives me ſo many val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable advantages, to the moſt important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of devotion and philoſophy; and I hope I may add uſefulneſs too.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 20—22. Doddridge's Letters, p. 10, 11.</note>
It is with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar pleaſure that the writer of the preſent nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative has tranſcribed this paſſage; as he thinks that he has reaſon to reflect, with ſome degree of ſatisfaction, that the ſpending of a number of
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:025154_0166_0FCE739AF5C818D0"/>
years in retired ſituations may be favourable to the increaſe of knowledge, and the habits of ſtudy.</p>
            <p>Whilſt Mr. Doddridge lived at Kibworth, and during the earlier years of his miniſtry, he was very exact and careful in his preparations for the pulpit. Both his ſermons and expoſitions were the reſult of deep attention and ſtudy; and they were drawn up with exactneſs of method, and correctneſs and elegance of ſtile. By this means he contracted a habit of delivering his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents uſually with judgment, and always with eaſe and freedom of language, when, afterwards, he was obliged, from the multiplicity of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and engagements, principally to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to extempore ſpeaking. Indeed, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he was called out on particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the period I have now ſpecified was the time in which Mr. Doddridge more eſpecially excelled as a preacher. When I was a ſtudent under him, he uſed frequently, on a Saturday evening, to read in the academy, the ſermons he had made in his younger years; and they were much admired by his pupils, as containing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels for their imitation, far ſuperior to thoſe which he could then have leiſure to give in his uſual Sunday diſcourſes. One thing which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed moſt of us was, that theſe ſermons had leſs of the Calviniſtical dreſs of expreſſion than was adopted by him after his ſettlement at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton.</p>
            <p>Beſides the pains which Mr. Doddridge took to acquaint himſelf with con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>verſial and criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal theology, he was in the continual habit of
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:025154_0167_0FCE739FE1E74688"/>
reading deeply and ſeriouſly the writers of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical divinity. Among theſe, his peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites were Tillotſon, Howe, and Baxter;<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi, ſupra, p. 22.</note> and undoubtedly they are authors from whom the clergy of every denomination may derive the richeſt ſtores of private improvement and public utility. I remember to have heard him ſpeak of Barrow with great energy of commendation. Many of the divines of the latter part of the laſt century (among whom the Church of England claims the larger number) were incomparably excellent for the high ſpirit of devotion, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſentiment, and the energy and copiouſneſs of ſtile; and the neglect of them has been of no advantage to modern times.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of Mr. Doddridge's ſerious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, he did not diſcontinue his regard to polite literature. Having been early acquainted with the French tongue, he was frequent in the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the elegant writers of that nation. He thought that many of them were poſſeſſed of very great genius, and he applauded them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted with the ancients, thoſe prime maſters of eloquence and poetry. Of all their dramatic poets he met with none whom he admired ſo much as Racine. He was charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the pomp, elegance, and harmony of his language, as well as with the majeſty, tenderneſs, and propriety of his ſentiments. His pieces, in general, for the ſtage, he approved, as conducted with a wonderful mixture of grandeur and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, which ſufficiently diſtinguiſh him from the dulneſs of ſome tragedians, and the bombaſt
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:025154_0168_0FCE73A0EC64E9F8"/>
of others. Another of Mr. Doddridge's favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite authors was Fenelon, Archbiſhop of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray. That writer's Reflections upon Eloquence, in particular, he looked upon as one of the moſt judicious performances he had ever ſeen. Mr. Doddridge was not equally an admirer of the French ſermons. Theſe he judged to be far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to thoſe of our Engliſh divines. Bourda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue's, notwithſtanding the high eſtimation they have been held in, appeared to him to be little better than empty harangues. Many of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inais' he eſteemed to be good; but of all which he had then ſeen, he gave the preference to the diſcourſes of Mr. Superville, the Proteſtant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine at Rotterdam. "He eſpecially excels," ſaid Mr. Doddridge, in a letter to an ingenious young friend,
<q>in the beauty of his imagery, deſcriptions, and ſimiles, and ſome of the moſt pathetic expoſtulations I ever ſaw. In ſhort, I believe he is perfectly to your taſte: only there is one thing which will diſpleaſe you as much as it did me; which is, that many of his arguments are very inconcluſive, though gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally as good as high Calviniſm will bear.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters to and from the Rev. Dr. Doddridge, p. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27.</note>
It is certain that Mr. Doddridge was afterwards particularly pleaſed with Saurin's ſermons, and ſtrongly recommended them to his pupils. Whether he was acquainted with Maſſillon is not recollected.</p>
            <p>While Mr. Doddridge was thus ſolicitous to enrich his mind with various knowledge, and to qualify himſelf for appearing with every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the pulpit, he was diligently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:025154_0169_0FCE73A36ECAD220"/>
to the private duties of his ſtation. He would often leave his ſtudy, to viſit and inſtruct the people under his care. In his manner of converſation he was careful to adapt himſelf to the capacities of his congregation, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly of perſons in the lower ranks of life. This object, likewiſe, he ſeriouſly regarded in his public diſcourſes, which, while they were judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and frequently elegant, were, at the ſame time, plain and eaſy to be underſtood. In this happy art he was probably not a little aſſiſted by his intimate acquaintance with the works of the excellent Tillotſon, which, however they may now be neglected by a faſtidious age, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deſerve to be mentioned with honour, as having eminently contributed to the introduction of a rational and uſeful method of preaching in England. How anxious our young divine was, to diſcharge every part of his duty as a chriſtian miniſter, whether in or out of the pulpit, with the greateſt fidelity and zeal, is evident from the copious extracts which Mr. Orton has given from his diary.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 13—32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In October, 1725, Mr. Doddridge removed his abode to Market-Harborough, in doing which he did not diſcontinue his relation to the people at Kibworth. He preached to them as before, excepting on ſacrament days, when his place was ſupplied by Mr. Some of Harborough, who had taken upon him the paſtoral care of the ſmall ſociety at Kibworth, in conjunction with his own. This change in Mr. Doddridge's reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was very advantageous to him, as it gave
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:025154_0170_0FCE73A4D4D75B90"/>
him an opportunity of nearer converſe and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with a gentleman, to whom he had been under early obligations, and who, next to Mr. Clark, was, perhaps, the beſt friend he had ever experienced. Mr. Some was a perſon of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon piety, zeal, prudence, and ſagacity. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he appears to have been the prime ornament among the diſſenting miniſters in that part of the kingdom. For the memory of this excellent man, who died on the twenty-ninth of May, 1737, Mr. Doddridge always maintained the moſt affectionate regard, which he ſtrongly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied on ſeveral occaſions. He publiſhed, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſome years after Mr. Some's deceaſe, a judicious tract that had been written by him on the ſubject of inoculation, for the purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the religious difficulties with which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy minds had been embarraſſed, in reſpect to that practice. In this view the pamphlet has been of very conſiderable utility. I do not find that Mr. Some ever printed more than two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; one in the year 1729, concerning the proper "Methods to be taken by Miniſters for the Revival of Religion;" and another in 1736, preached at the funeral of the Reverend Thomas Saunders of Kettering.<note n="†" place="bottom">Orton, ubi, ſupra, p. 32, 33, 34.

            <p>The abilities and talents of Mr. Doddridge occaſioned him to be ſought for by much more numerous congregations than that in which he firſt ſettled. Even ſo early as in the year 1723, when he had but lately finiſhed his academical ſtudies, he received an invitation to undertake
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:025154_0171_0FCE73A8C90D3AF0"/>
the paſtoral charge of a large ſociety of diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the city of London. But he thought himſelf unequal to ſo great a burden. Beſides this, he was diſcouraged by the unhappy differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which at that time ſubſiſted between the non-conformiſt miniſters of the metropolis and its neighborhood, about ſubſcribing or not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to articles of faith, in the words of human device, as a teſt of orthodoxy. In his anſwer to the gentleman who tranſmitted the invitation to him, he diſplayed the liberality of his own mind; for after mentioning ſome other objections to the propoſal, he added as follows:
<q>I might alſo have been required to ſubſcribe; which I am reſolved never to do. We have no diſputes on that matter in theſe parts. A neighbouring gentleman once endeavoured to introduce a ſubſcription; but it was effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overruled by Mr. Some of Harborough, Mr. Norris of Welford, and Mr. Jennings, my tutor. I ſhall content myſelf here, with being a benevolent well-wiſher to the intereſts of liberty and peace.</q>

            <p>In 1726-7, Mr. Doddridge was recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his friend Mr. Clark to a vacant congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at Hertford; the conſequence of which was, that two perſons were ſent to Kibworth, to hear him. The reſult of this matter, which ſtrongly diſplays the ridiculouſly narrow ſpirit of ſome of the diſſenters at that period, is thus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourouſly related by Mr. Clark in one of his letters.
<q>Not having any other opportunity, I thought it neceſſary to ſend you without
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:025154_0172_0FCE73A9F14F3EC8"/>
delay by the poſt, to complain of your keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your place of worſhip ſuch ſtumbling-blocks and ſuperſtitious cuſtoms, as are very offenſive to your chriſtian brethren. It is no wonder you are thought a legal preacher, when you have the ten commandments paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the walls of your chapel. Beſides, you have a clerk, it ſeems, ſo impertinent as to ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> with an audible voice. O tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora! O mores! that ſuch a rag of popery ſhould ever be tolerated in a congregation of Proteſtant diſſenters; and, to complete all, you, the miniſter, conclude your prayers with a form called the Lord's prayer. Do you know what miſchief you have done? What a blot you have brought upon yourſelf by ſuch offenſive practices? It may be, you are ſurpriſed at what this means. In a few words then, Mr. Chandler of Bedford, being on his return home at Mr. Eccles's, deſired him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my motion to write to Hertford, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend you to them in his name, as a very fit man to be their miniſter. Upon this, two members of that congregation went over the other day to hear you preach. But no ſooner did they come into the place, but they found themſelves diſappointed; and what they heard at the cloſe, confirmed them ſo much in their prejudices, that they thought it needleſs to ſay any thing of their intention to you. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to preach laſt Sunday at Ware, I heard all this there, and afterwards at Hertford. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but pity them for their weakneſs; and do not know but it is happy for you not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:025154_0173_0FCE73AB71DCC928"/>
ſuch odd humours.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Letters to and from the Rev. Dr. Doddridge, p. 14, 15.</note> It was indeed happy for Mr. Doddridge, that he had not to encounter with people of ſuch a rigid and capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpoſition. However, it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that ſome of the diſſenters at Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford had ſenſe enough to be angry that two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould take upon them to judge for the whole ſociety.</p>
            <p>Mr. Doddridge, in the year 1728, received a preſſing invitation from one of the diſſenting congregations at Nottingham, and a few months after, from the other. There were many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that tended to recommend both the invitations. The ſocieties were large and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable, the ſalary conſiderable, the town pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous and flouriſhing, its ſituation delightful, the converſation agreeable, and the proſpect of uſefulneſs very extenſive. Nevertheleſs, after mature deliberation, Mr. Doddridge determined to adhere to the plan of continuing to purſue his ſchemes of improvement in a more private reſidence. In this determination he did not act without conſulting his wiſeſt friends, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for divine direction. In 1729, he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen aſſiſtant to Mr. Some at Harborough; the congregation at that place being deſirous to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his labours more frequently than before: the reſult of which choice was, that he preached there and at Kibworth alternately. At this time of his life, though he was but little more than twenty-ſeven years of age, the fame of his abilities and worth was ſo much ſpread abroad, that his ſettlement among them was ſought for
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:025154_0174_0FCE73AD1F4226C8"/>
by various large ſocieties beſides thoſe already mentioned. But his regard to Mr. Some, his love for the people at Kibworth, and his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to have greater leiſure for ſtudy than he could enjoy in a populous town and extenſive connections, ſtill retained their influence in lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to decline the different propoſals that were made to him for a removal.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi, ſupra. p. 39— 41.</note>
            </p>
            <p>When Mr. Doddridge left the academy, Mr. Jennings, a few weeks before his death, which happened in the prime of his days, on the eighth of July, 1723, earneſtly preſſed his pupil to keep in view the improvement of the courſe he had gone through of academical lectures, and to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that courſe in ſuch a manner as to refer what occurred to him, to the compendiums his tutor had drawn up, that they might be illuſtrated and enriched. Our young divine did not then ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect what was the motive of Mr. Jennings in giving him this advice. But he afterwards was informed, that his tutor had declared it to be his opinion, that if it ſhould pleaſe GOD to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him early in life, Mr. Doddridge was the moſt likely of any of his pupils to purſue the ſchemes which he had formed; and which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, were very far from being complete, as he died about eight years after he had undertaken the conduct of a theological academy. Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Mr. Jennings's advice, Mr. Doddridge, during his ſettlement at Kibworth, reviewed his courſe of lectures with care. About this time, an ingenious young gentleman, Mr. Thomas Benyon, ſon of Dr. Samuel Benyon, a celebrated
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:025154_0175_0FCE73AE6B3AFC70"/>
miniſter and tutor at Shrewſbury, who died in 1708, had entertained thoughts of reviving the ſcheme of his father. Converſing one day with Mr. Doddridge, the diſcourſe turned upon the beſt method of conducting the preparatory ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies of youth intended for the miniſtry. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, Mr. Benyon earneſtly requeſted of his friend, that he would write down his ſentiments upon the ſubject. Mr. Doddridge conſented, and drew up his thoughts in the form of a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which grew into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the work, Mr. Benyon, for whoſe uſe it was deſigned, died, and the treatiſe remained in the writer's own hands. Mr. Saunders of Kettering, happening to ſee it in his ſtudy, deſired to have the peruſal of it; after which he ſhewed it to Dr. Watts, with whom Mr. Doddridge had then no perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. The Doctor, who was much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the plan, made ſome remarks upon it, and communicated it to ſeveral of his friends, who all concurred in opinion, that the perſon who had drawn it up was beſt qualified to carry it into execution. Accordingly, application was made to him for that purpoſe; and Mr. Some was the gentleman principally employed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the affair. He knew that Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge had every important and deſirable qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the inſtruction of youth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he not only propoſed his undertaking it, but preſſed the matter upon him in the ſtrongeſt terms. Nor would he by any means allow the validity of his plea of incapacity, but urged that, ſuppoſing him leſs capable than his friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:025154_0176_0FCE73B2466BFF48"/>
he might improve his time in his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when engaged in ſuch a work with a few pupils, to greater advantage than without them. This was a very proper conſideration: for every man who has ſuſtained the character of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor, if he has diſcharged his duty with a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of attention and fidelity, muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the employment has highly contributed to the accuracy and increaſe of his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Mr. Some had likewiſe, unknown to Mr. Doddridge, obtained from the relations of ſome young men, the promiſe of putting them under his care, by which another objection that might have ariſen was precluded; and Mr. Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders offered his brother to be the firſt pupil of the intended academy. It was with great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and diffidence that Mr. Doddridge hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe ſolicitations. He was deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the importance and difficulty of the undertaking, and devoutly implored the direction and aſſiſtance of the Supreme Being. Whilſt he was ſtill in doubt with regard to his final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, he eſteemed it a kind providence that the diſſenting miniſters in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had agreed to meet at Lutterworth, on the tenth of April, 1729, to ſpend a day in humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prayer for the revival of religion. To this aſſembly Mr. Some propoſed the ſcheme that had been concerted for the eſtabliſhment of an academy at Harborough, under the care of his young friend; and it met with the entire appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the gentlemen preſent. They unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly concurred in their ſentiments of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and uſefulneſs of the deſign, and Mr.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:025154_0177_0FCE73B3AF2E8D60"/>
Doddridge's qualifications for conducting it; and they promiſed him all the aſſiſtance and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement that were in their power. This had great weight in forming his reſolution. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, before the matter was abſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, he thought proper to conſult ſome of his brethren and friends at a diſtance, and eſpecially Mr. Clark; who at firſt heſitated on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and, on account of Mr. Doddridge's admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able talents for the pulpit, ſeemed rather to wiſh that he might have a ſettlement in London. However, he ſoon approved of the ſcheme; as did the reſt of the perſons whoſe advice had been ſolicited. Mr. Doddridge conſented, therefore, to the execution of a plan which, on every ſide, was ſo zealouſly and earneſtly recommended. What much encouraged him to enter upon the office of an academical tutor, was the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his retreat at Harborough; the paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral care of the congregation there, and at Kib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, being fulfilled by Mr. Some; ſo that he had little to do as a miniſter, excepting to make one ſermon a week, which conſidering the vigour and celerity of his mind, was an eaſy taſk.</p>
            <p>Mr. Doddridge having, at length, reſolved to comply with the wiſhes of his friends, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reviewed his plans of Academical Studies, with Dr. Watts's remarks, and correſponded with that eminent divine on the ſubject. He read, likewiſe, every valuable book which he could meet with on the education of youth, and made ſuch extracts as he thought might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the execution of his deſign. Beſides this, he wrote many letters to the miniſters of
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:025154_0178_0FCE73B52B088E48"/>
different denominations, with whom he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, requeſting their advice in his great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. One gentleman whom he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſulted was the Rev. Dr. Samuel Wright, of London, who favoured him with his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at large, eſpecially on the head of divinity lectures. Mr. Clark communicated to him va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tranſcripts from the lectures of Mr. Jones, who had been a tutor of diſtinguiſhed ability and learning, at Tewkſbury in Gloceſterſhire. With all theſe preparations, Mr. Doddridge thought it his wiſdom to make a trial firſt in a private way, with only two or three ſtudents, declining to receive others that offered. At Midſummer, 1729, he opened his academy. The ſubject of his firſt lecture to his pupils was of a religious kind, ſhewing the nature, reaſonableneſs, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, of their acknowledging GOD in their ſtudies. In the ſecond, he gave directions for their behaviour to him, to each other, to the family, and all around them; with proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to excite their attention to a right conduct in theſe reſpects. After this he proceeded to his ordinary courſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 41—47. Doddridge's Letter p. 19, 20.</note> Thus was he led to a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of life which formed the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ſcene of his uſefulneſs. The late Rev. Hugh Farmer, ſo well known among the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters as a moſt excellent preacher, and by the literary world in general for his extenſive learning and valuable publications, was one of Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's earlieſt ſtudents.</p>
            <p>Our young tutor had been employed in his preceptorial capacity but a few months, when
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:025154_0179_0FCE73B926000318"/>
he was directed by Providence to a ſituation of greater uſefulneſs as a chriſtian miniſter. There being a vacancy in the diſſenting congregation at Caſtle-Hill, in Northampton, in conſequence of the removal of Mr. Tingey to London, Mr. Doddridge preached occaſionally to them, as did others of his brethren. In doing this, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were ſo acceptable to the people, that he was invited and ſtrongly urged by them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their paſtor. Some of his friends, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Mr. Some, adviſed his continuance at Harborough. The arguments alledged by them were, that he would have more time to apply to his work as a tutor, than if he had the ſole care of a large ſociety; and that there was another miniſter, who, it was thought, might well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the vacancy, though, perhaps, not in every reſpect equally to the ſatisfaction of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Theſe conſiderations had ſuch weight with him, that he determined to continue in his preſent ſtation. In purſuance of this view of the caſe, Mr. Some went to Northampton, to perſuade the people to wave their application. But when he came there, and ſaw their zeal and affection in the affair, and heard the motives by which they acted, and the circumſtances in which they ſtood, he was, as he expreſſed it, like Saul among the prophets, and immediately wrote to Mr. Doddridge to preſs his acceptance of the invitation. The ſame thing was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged by his friend Mr. Clark. Still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he was averſe, on many accounts, to a change in his ſituation. But, being deſirous of teſtifying his gratitude and regard to the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:025154_0180_0FCE73BAA39F1460"/>
he made them a viſit, on purpoſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in perſon his reaſons for declining their propoſal. Whilſt he was on this viſit, ſeveral events occurred, which ſtrongly tended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon him to alter his reſolution. One or two of them, perhaps, may be deemed, by ſome of thoſe who may read Mr. Orton's account of them, to have a tincture of enthuſiaſtic weakneſs; but there was an argument preſented to him, which muſt be allowed to have had very great weight. Before he returned to Harborough, the young perſons of the ſociety came to him in a body; earneſtly entreated his ſettlement among them; and promiſed to ſubmit to all ſuch meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of inſtruction as he ſhould think proper. This laſt circumſtance was the conſideration that turned the ſcales for his going to Northampton, after they had long hovered in uncertainty.</p>
            <p>On the twenty-fourth of December, 1729, Mr. Doddridge removed, with his academy, from Harborough to Northampton, and in the ſpace of two or three weeks commenced houſekeeping. This important change in his ſituation was not ſuffered to paſs without his entering into a ſevere examination of his own mind, and forming the moſt pious and ſacred reſolutions with reſpect to his conduct, both as a maſter of a family and a miniſter of the goſpel. That he might be the better prepared for the large paſtoral work now devolved upon him, he employed part of the time between his ſettlement and his ordination in reading the beſt treatiſes on the qualifications and duties of the miniſterial office. The books particularly ſtudied by him were Chryſoſtom on
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:025154_0181_0FCE73BBF6D790E8"/>
the Prieſthood, Bowles's Paſtor Evangelicus, Burnet on the Paſtoral Care, and Baxter's Gildas Salvianus. He read, likewiſe, the lives of ſome pious and active miniſters, among which that of the Rev. Mr. Philip Henry afforded him much inſtruction and encouragement. Beſides this, he ſelected, from the works which he peruſed, the moſt important advices, reflections, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and made a collection of thoſe maxims of prudence and diſcretion, an attention to which he thought would be calculated to ſecure eſteem and uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>About two months after Mr. Doddridge's ſettlement at Northampton, he was ſeized with a dangerous illneſs, which gave many painful fears to his friends, leſt a life of ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed excellence, and ſuch promiſing utility, ſhould be ſpeedily cut off. But, through a merciful Providence, he recovered from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and, in due time, his health was complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored. While he was yet in a very weak ſtate, the day arrived, which had been fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his ordination; and it was a day to him of great ſolemnity and importance, and which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed his moſt devout meditations. This event took place on the nineteenth of March, 1729-30. It is but an act of juſtice to record the names of the worthy miniſters who were engaged in ſetting apart for the paſtoral office ſo eminent an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſervice to the church and the world. Mr. Goodrich of Oundle began with prayer and reading the ſcriptures. Mr. Dawſon of Hinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley prayed before ſermon. Then Mr. Watſon of Leiceſter preached a diſcourſe from 1 Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:025154_0182_0FCE73BE8200B5E8"/>
iii.1. "This is a true ſaying, if a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the office of a biſhop, he deſireth a good work." After this, the call of the church was read by Mr. Norris of Welford; and when Mr. Doddridge had declared his acceptance of it, he delivered his confeſſion of faith, which was followed by what is uſually called the ordination prayer. The charge to Mr. Doddridge was given by Mr. Clark of St. Alban's and the exhortation to the people by Mr. Saunders of Kettering; and the whole ſolemnity was concluded with a prayer by Mr. Mattock of Daventry.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 47—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</note> It is rather ſurpriſing that we do not meet with the name of Mr. Some on this occaſion. Some particular incident, now not known, perhaps a ſudden illneſs, might have deprived Mr. Doddridge of the aſſiſtance of ſo valuable and intimate a friend. That the cauſe ſhould not have been mentioned by Mr. Orton in his Memoirs, or by Mr. Doddridge in his Diary, is an omiſſion that could ſcarcely have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>It would carry us beyond the limits that muſt be aſſigned to the preſent narrative, to deſcribe, at large, the diligence, zeal, and fervour, with which Mr. Doddridge diſcharged his paſtoral duty. This matter is fully inſiſted upon by Mr. Orton, to whom we muſt refer for a more minute detail of particulars. However, we ſhall inſiſt upon a few leading circumſtances. Mr. Doddridge's firſt care was to know the eſtate of his flock; for which purpoſe he made diligent enquiry into the members and ſtated hearers of which it conſiſted, and entered in a book their
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:025154_0183_0FCE73C29CF73110"/>
names, families, places of abode, connections and characters. By this he was better enabled to adapt his viſits and advices to their reſpective ſituations, and their religious improvement. With regard to the compoſition of ſermons, his work as a tutor, and the paſtoral inſpection of a very numerous congregation, rendered it next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that his diſcourſes for the pulpit ſhould be ſo exact and accurate as they were in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of his miniſtry. "Nor was it," ſays Mr. Orton,
<q>needful. Having habituated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for ſeveral years, to correct compoſitions, having laid up ſuch a fund of knowledge, eſpecially of the ſcriptures, which was daily increaſing by his ſtudies and lectures, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times only wrote down the heads and leading thoughts of his ſermons, and the principal texts of ſcripture he deſigned to introduce. But he was ſo thoroughly maſter of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and had ſuch a ready utterance and ſo warm a heart, that perhaps few miniſters can compoſe better diſcourſes than he delivered from theſe ſhort hints.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi, ſupra, p. 57, 58.</note> This encomium is, I think, to be admitted with ſome ſlight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of abatement. The ſermons of Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge were different, as he was differently cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced. When he had leiſure to draw out his plan, and the hints of what he propoſed to ſay, to a conſiderable extent, his diſcourſes were often excellent in a high degree. But, at other times, when he could but juſt lay down his ſcheme, with only a very few thoughts under it, his ſermons, eſpecially if he was not in a full
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:025154_0184_0FCE73C430148090"/>
flow of ſpirits, were leſs valuable. Once, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my reſidence with him, a number of pupils complained, through the medium of Mr. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, that, though their revered tutor's academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lectures were admirable, they had not in him a ſufficiently correct model of pulpit compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The conſequence of the information was, that his ſermons became far ſuperior to what they had ſometimes formerly been; for he was the moſt candid of all men to the voice of gentle admonition. When, however, he took the leaſt pains, he was always perſpicuous in his method, and natural and orderly in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of his ſentiments; and hence he furniſhed an example, from which many of the young men educated under him deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſmall benefit in their future labours. I remember a remarkable inſtance of his power in extemporaneous ſpeaking. Akenſide the poet, who in early life was ſettled, for a ſhort time, at Northampton, being viſited by ſome relations from Newcaſtle upon Tyne, who were diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, came with them, unexpectedly, one Sunday morning, to Dr. Doddridge's meeting. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he preached upon was a common orthodox topic, for which he had ſcarcely made any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. But he rouſed his faculties on the occaſion, and ſpoke with ſuch energy, variety, and eloquence, as excited my warmeſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and muſt have impreſſed Dr. Akenſide with a high opinion of his abilities. The ingenious poet and the learned divine were in the habits of conſiderable intimacy while the former reſided at Northampton. A matter of controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:025154_0185_0FCE73C5E7D38E80"/>
them was, how far the ancient heathen philoſophers were acquainted with, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated, the doctrine of immortality. Aken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide contended for the honour of the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and Doddridge for that of the chriſtian revelation. The ſubject was purſued, in expreſs conferences, for two or three evenings; and both the gentlemen exerted their talents, and collected their literature on the different ſides of the queſtion. Dr. Doddridge, who loved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his pupils of whatever he met with which he thought would contribute to their inſtruction and pleaſure, related to us, on the ſucceeding mornings, the arguments that had been produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the reſult of the debate.</p>
            <p>Without entering into a particular detail of many things which might be ſaid of Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge as a preacher, I cannot help taking notice that he was always warm and affectionate in the applications of his ſermons. His ſentiments on this head he has thus expreſſed:
<q>It is indeed unworthy the character of a man and a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, to endeavour to tranſport men's paſſions, while the underſtanding is left uninformed, and the reaſon unconvinced. But, ſo far as is conſiſtent with a proper regard to this lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of our nature, I would ſpeak and write of divine truth with a holy fervency. Nor can I imagine that it would bode well to the intereſt of religion to endeavour to lay all thoſe paſſions aſleep, which ſurely GOD im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in our hearts to ſerve the religions as well as the civil life, and which, after all, will probably be employed to ſome very excellent
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:025154_0186_0FCE73C79B44F500"/>
or very pernicious purpoſes.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 61.</note> This is the language of wiſdom. True eloquence conſiſts in an union of the rational, the forcible and the pathetic; and to addreſs to the affections as well as to the reaſon, of mankind, is the dictate of the ſoundeſt philoſophy. The cold and feeble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions of many diſcourſes from the pulpit, are as diſguſting to a juſt taſte, as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable with regard to religious improvement.</p>
            <p>It muſt not be omitted, that Mr. Doddridge thought it a part of miniſterial prudence to take public notice of remarkable providential occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. He endeavoured, in his ſermons, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce leſſons of wiſdom and piety from import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant tranſactions, affecting the nation, town, or any conſiderable number of his hearers. Nor did he neglect uncommon appearances of nature, or other events, that were the ſubjects of gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al converſation; to which may be added the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year, and eſpecially the mercies of harveſt. From an attention to theſe different circumſtances, his diſcourſes were accompanied with a greater extent of variety and uſefulneſs. He was a friend to funeral ſermons, which, if they be not too frequently exerciſed or convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the purpoſes of adulation, conſtitute an inſtructive and an affecting part of compoſitions for the pulpit. In his manner of ſpeaking he had an earneſtneſs and pathos which tended great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to affect his hearers. By ſome perſons his pronunciation and action were judged to be too ſtrong and vehement; but to thoſe who were acquainted with the vivacity of his temper, and
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:025154_0187_0FCE73CB05E5E728"/>
his uſual mode of converſation, it appeared quite natural and unaffected.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to his conduct, as a miniſter, out of the pulpit, it muſt ſuffice briefly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that he was very exact in the exerciſe of chriſtian diſcipline, and in ſeparating thoſe from the church who were a reproach to their religious profeſſion; that he had a deep concern and affectionate regard for the riſing generation; and that, in the midſt of his numerous duties and engagements, it was matter of ſurpriſe that he could ſpare ſo much time, as he did, for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral viſits. It was a grief to him to find that the children of ſome of his hearers, through the ignorance and poverty of their parents, had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er been taught to read; and therefore he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded his people, in 1738, to concur with him in eſtabliſhing a charity ſchool. In this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent deſign he met with ſo much encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that a foundation was laid for inſtructing and clothing twenty boys, who were put under the care of a pious and ſkilful maſter. The Doctor himſelf often viſited the ſchool and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and exhorted the children; accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his exhortations with affectionate prayers for their improvement and welfare. With ſuch diſtinguiſhed abilities of the mind, and with ſuch excellent virtues of the heart, it will not be deemed ſurpriſing that he poſſeſſed, in a very high degree, the eſteem and love of his congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. In his laſt will he bore this teſtimony to their character,
<q>That he had ſpent the moſt delightful hours of his life in aſſerting the devotions of as ſerious, as grateful, and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:025154_0188_0FCE73CC95795080"/>
a people, as perhaps any miniſter ever had the happineſs to ſerve.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, 62—73.</note> This charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was no doubt generally, and indeed almoſt univerſally, true. Nevertheleſs, he was not without his calls for the exerciſe of patience. There were perſons belonging to his ſociety who were narrow bigots, and weak enthuſiaſts; and theſe ſometimes entruded upon him in a fooliſh and troubleſome manner. He behaved, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to them with a condeſcenſion and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they ſcarcely deſerved, and of which few miniſters of the goſpel would be able to ſet an equally ſtriking example.</p>
            <p>In 1730, Mr. Doddridge entered into the matrimonial relation with Mrs. Mercy Maris, a native of Worceſter, and a lady in whom he found every qualification that could render mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage deſirable. She was, indeed, a religious, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and affectionate companion. Her conſtitution was delicate, and her health, at times precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which often gave her huſband no ſmall cauſe of alarm; but ſhe was happily continued to him through his whole life, and ſurvived him a great number of years.<note n="†" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Mr. Doddridge, in younger life, afforded va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious proofs of a poetical turn, moſt of which are in the poſſeſſion of the preſent biographer. The excellent lines which he wrote on the motto

            <p>Mr. Doddridge had a talent at ſatyrical epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams; an inſtance of which is the following, written on one of his pupils, a weak young man, who thought that he had invented a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of flying to the moon.</p>

            <l>That he ſets out with ſuch an empty head.</l>
            <p>When Mr. Doddridge removed to Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, his academy was only in its infancy; but it ſoon grew into great reputation, and the number of ſtudents increaſed every year. In 1734, he found it neceſſary to have a ſtated aſſiſtant, to whom he aſſigned part of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior pupils, and the ſuperintendence of the whole of them when he happened to be abſent.

He was ſolicitous to maintain the reputation and eſteem of the gentlemen who ſucceſſively ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this character, by his own behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and the reſpect which he required from the ſtudents to them;
<q>and they thought themſelves happy in his friendſhip, and the opportunities they had, by his converſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and example, to improve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while they were aſſiſting in the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra.</note>

In theſe words, which are Mr. Orton's, he ſpoke from his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and every one who acted in the ſame ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity might adopt ſimilar language. Such of them as I have been acquainted with, were very reſpectable for their knowledge; and in the choice of them a particular regard was paid to their ſkill in the Greek and Latin claſſics, as well as to their ability for inſtructing the young men in certain departments of mathematical and philoſophical ſcience. Among Dr. Doddridge's aſſiſtants, beſides Mr. Orton, may be named the late Rev. Dr. Aikin, and the Rev. Mr. James Robertſon, who has been for many years Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of Oriental Literature in the Univerſity of Edinburgh. Dr. Aikin was afterwards, firſt, claſſical, and then theological tutor at Warring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; and perhaps, as a lecturer, he was never exceeded. This is the teſtimony that has been uniformly given of him by all who had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being his pupils. What he was as a parental inſtructor, will be judged of from the excellent and elegant productions of his ſon and daughter, Dr. John Aikin and Mrs. Barbauld.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="unknown:025154_0192_0FCE73D4AE7F0F98"/>Since Dr. Doddridge's office as a tutor was the moſt important ſtation in which he appeared, it is an eſſential part of a life written of him, to relate, ſomewhat minutely, how he conducted himſelf in that capacity. He choſe to have as many pupils as poſſible in his own family, that they might be more immediately under his own eye and government; and latterly, he had a houſe large and commodious enough to contain all of them, two or three excepted. The orders of the ſeminary were ſuch as ſuited ſtudents of a certain age; being a due medium between the rigour of ſchool diſcipline and an unlimited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. It was an eſtabliſhed law, that every pupil ſhould riſe at ſix o'clock in the ſummer, and at ſeven in the winter. Each young man, in his turn, ſuſtained the weekly office of moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, part of whoſe buſineſs was to call up the reſt every morning; and they were to appear in the public room, ſoon after the fixed hour. Thoſe who did not attend were ſubject to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary penalty; but if any repeatedly indulged to a habit of ſloth, they were obliged to prepare an additional academical exerciſe. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the monitor's neglect, which I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect to have happened, was a double fine. Their tutor ſet them an example of diligence by being almoſt univerſally preſent with them at theſe early riſings. After a prayer, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom laſted more than two or three minutes, the young gentlemen retired to their reſpective clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets till the time of family worſhip. That ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was begun by the Doctor with a ſhort pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for the divine preſence and bleſſing. Some
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:025154_0193_0FCE73D62FFF79C0"/>
of the ſtudents then read a chapter of the Old Teſtament from Hebrew into Engliſh, which he critically expounded, and practically improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After this a pſalm was ſung, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a longer prayer than at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. On Sunday mornings ſomething entirely devotional and practical was ſubſtitued in the room of the uſual expoſition. In the evening the worſhip was conducted in the ſame method, with only this difference; that a chapter of the New Teſtament was read by the pupils from Greek into Engliſh, and the ſenior ſtudents pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in rotation. The Doctor, when preſent, which was generally the caſe, expounded the New Teſtament in the ſame manner as he did the Old.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> It would give me pleaſure, if I could ſay, that ſome of the young men never ſlily pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced an Engliſh Bible by the ſide of the Hebrew one. Such of the pupils as were boarded out of the houſe were obliged to attend and take their parts in the domeſtic devotions; and thoſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in or out of the family, who were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, were ſubject to a fine, or, if their abſence was frequent, to public reprehenſion. By the method which Dr. Doddridge purſued, the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents had an opportunity of hearing him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound moſt of the Old Teſtament, and the whole of the New, more than once. The more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent among them took hints of what was deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered. One piece of advice given them by the Doctor was, to get the Old Teſtament, and Wetſtein's Greek Teſtament interleaved, in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in order to write in them the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:025154_0194_0FCE73D7C4325F10"/>
remarks for the illuſtration of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which either occurred in their tutor's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or were derived from their own read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, converſation, and reflections.</p>
            <p>Soon after breakfaſt, Dr. Doddridge proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the diſcharge of his academical duty. The ſeveral claſſes were taken by him in their proper order, and he lectured to each of them about the ſpace of an hour. His aſſiſtant was at the ſame time engaged in a ſimilar manner. Rich's ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand was one of the firſt things which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his pupils to learn, that he might be able to tranſcribe his own lectures, and make extracts from the books they read and conſulted, with greater eaſe and celerity. Indeed, this was a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance from which they might derive great advantage in future life, as the experience of the preſent writer can teſtify. Care was taken, in the firſt year of the young men's courſe, that they ſhould retain and improve that knowledge of Greek and Latin which they had acquired at ſchool. With regard to the Hebrew language, they were either initiated into it, or, if they had learned it before, were carried on to greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. Uſually the attention to claſſical literature was extended through the ſecond year of the courſe. Of late, the diſſenting academies have exerted a far ſuperior zeal with reſpect to this very important object. Whilſt I was one of the tutors at Hoxton, claſſical inſtruction was continued at leaſt for three years; and at the new college, Hackney, it makes a part of the whole courſe. Beſides what was done in a morning, the Greek and Latin lectures, at Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:025154_0195_0FCE73DB99B2F2F0"/>
were read every evening, uſually by the aſſiſtant, though ſometimes by himſelf. If any of the pupils were deficient in the knowledge of the Greek, ſuch of the ſeniors as were ſkilled in that language were appointed to be their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors, at ſeparate hours. Thoſe who choſe it were taught the French tongue. The longer Dr. Doddridge lived, the more was he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the great importance of a learned, as well as a pious education, for the chriſtian miniſtry. Having found that ſome who came under his care were not competently acquainted with the claſſics, he formed a ſcheme for aſſiſting youths, of a promiſing genius and a ſerious temper, in their preparations for academical ſtudies; and he met with good encouragement in the ſcheme from the contributions of many of his friends. As it commenced only two years before his death, much progreſs could not be made in it; but a ſimilar plan has ſince been adopted by Mr. Coward's truſtees, with ſingular utility. Dr. Doddridge was not, in every inſtance, ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the claſſical preparation of the ſtudents received into his ſeminary, as could have been wiſhed. Sometimes he admitted ſerious young men, of perhaps three or four and twenty years of age, who had had very little of that prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who never diſtinguiſhed themſelves, in this reſpect, by their ſubſequent improvement. He thought, however, that they might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in plain country congregations; which was undoubtedly the caſe. Several of them, though not abounding in learning, ſuſtained the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial character with a decent reputation. The
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:025154_0196_0FCE73DCEB6D3BB8"/>
Doctor, I believe, towards the cloſe of his life, was of opinion that he had gone far enough in this matter.</p>
            <p>Other things which were read to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, during the firſt year of their courſe, were ſyſtems of logic, rhetoric, geography, and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſics. The logic was Dr. Watts's, which was very fully purſued. On rhetoric the lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were ſlender and imperfect, being only a ſlight enlargement of a ſmall compendium that had been drawn up by Mr. Jennings. Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy was better taught; but of metaphyſics there was only given at this time a brief epitome, as the great objects it preſents were afterwards more amply conſidered. Under theſe ſeveral heads the pupils were referred to particular paſſages in ſuch authors as treated upon them. This part of the courſe was accompanied with lectures on the principles of geometry and algebra, which, beſides their intrinſic excellence, were happily calculated to form in the young men a fixedneſs of attention, and a habit of rightly diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and properly arranging their conceptions. When theſe branches of ſcience were finiſhed, the ſtudents were introduced to the knowledge of trigonometry, conic-ſections, and celeſtial mechanics; under which laſt term was included a collection of important propoſitions, taken chiefly from Sir Iſaac Newton, and relating eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, though not ſolely, centripetal and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifugal forces. A ſyſtem of natural and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental philoſophy, comprehending mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics, ſtatics, hydroſtatics, optics, pneumatics, and aſtronomy, was likewiſe read, with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:025154_0197_0FCE73DE6C0666A8"/>
to the beſt authors on theſe ſubjects. Muſchenbroek was made uſe of in my time as a text book, and afterwards Rowning. For the particular objects to which they relate, recourſe was had to Clarc on Fluids, and Keill's Aſtronomy. The ſyſtem of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural philoſophy was illuſtrated by a neat and pretty large apparatus. As the pupils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their courſe, ſome other articles were alſo touched upon. Mr. Orton mentions par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly natural and civil hiſtory; but theſe two objects do not fall under my recollection. At moſt, they were ſcarcely enough conſidered to deſerve a diſtinct ſpecification. Such a view was given of the anatomy of the human body as was entitled to applauſe, and well calculated to inſpire the young men with the ſentiments of veneration and love for the ſupreme Artificer. In the latter years of their courſe, a large ſyſtem, drawn by Dr. Doddridge himſelf, was read of Jewiſh antiquities, with references to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal writers on the ſubject; in order to illuſtrate numberleſs paſſages of ſcripture, which could not otherwiſe be ſo well underſtood. In eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hiſtory the Doctor lectured from Lampe's Epitome. On the various ſects and doctrines of the ancient philoſophers he occaſionally gave ſome inſtruction from Buddaeus's Compendium; but this matter was never purſued to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable extent.</p>
            <p>All theſe branches of ſtudy, though of no ſmall conſequence, were, however, ſubordinate to what was the grand object of the attention of the young men, during three years of their courſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="200" facs="unknown:025154_0198_0FCE749E92B513E8"/>
which was Dr. Doddridge's Syſtem of Divinity, in the largeſt ſenſe of the word; including what is moſt material in pneumatology and ethics. In this work were contained, in as few words as perſpicuity would admit, the principal things which had occurred to the author's obſervation, relating to the conſtitution and properties of the human mind, the proofs of the exiſtence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of GOD, the nature of moral virtue, the various parts of it, the means ſubſervient to it, and the ſanctions by which its precepts, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the natural law of the ſupreme Being, are enforced. Under this head the arguments for a future life, deducible from the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, were particularly examined. A ſurvey was added, of what is, and generally has been, the ſtate of virtue in the world; whence a tranſition was eaſy to the neceſſity of a revelation, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to hope for it, and the kind of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with which it might probably be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hence the work proceeded to the actual evidence that may be produced in favour of that revelation which is contained in the ſcriptures. The genuineneſs, credibility, and inſpiration of the ſacred books were then treated upon at large, and vindicated from the moſt material objections that have been urged againſt them by ſceptical writers. This part of Dr. Doddridge's lectures was, perhaps of all others, the moſt important and uſeful. Having laid a firm foundation in ſo ample a ſtatement of the evidences of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he entered into a copious detail of what were, or, at leaſt, what appeared to him to be, the doctrines of ſcripture. In ſo doing, though he
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:025154_0199_0FCE73E02833B7B0"/>
ſtated and maintained his own opinions, which in a conſiderable degree were Calviniſtical, he never aſſumed the character of a dogmatiſt. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the arguments, and referred to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities on both ſides. The ſtudents were left to judge for themſelves; and they did judge for themſelves, with his perfect concurrence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, though no doubt, it was natural for him to be pleaſed when their ſentiments coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided with his own. Where this was not the caſe, it made no alteration in his affection and kind treatment, as the writer of the preſent nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative can gratefully witneſs. What ſeemed moſt evident to Dr. Doddridge on the ſubjects conſidered by him was digeſted into the form of propoſitions, ſome of which were problemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and the chief controverſies relative to each head were thrown into ſcholia. For the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of all of them, a large collection was made of references, in which the ſentiments and reaſonings of the principal authors on the points in queſtion might be ſeen in their own words. It was the buſineſs of the pupils to read and abridge theſe references in the intervals between the lectures. Dr. Doddridge's Syſtem of Divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity was his capital work, as a tutor. Much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was ſpent by him upon it; and he was continually enriching it with his remark on any new pruductions upon the various ſubjects to which it extended. It was tranſcribed by the generality of the ſtudents; and it may be truly obſerved concerning it, that it was well calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to lead them gradually on, from the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to the moſt important and difficult part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of theological knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="unknown:025154_0200_0FCE38362EE69F50"/>Beſides Dr. Doddridge's expoſitions in the family, critical lectures on the New Teſtament were delivered once a week, which the young men were permitted and encouraged to tranſcribe. In theſe were contained his obſervations on the language, meaning, and deſign of the ſacred writings, and the interpretations and criticiſms of the moſt eminent commentators. Many of theſe obſervations occur in his Family Expoſitor. As a ſet of lectures, they never attained to a very full and perfect form.</p>
            <p>Polite literature, if not copiouſly inſiſted upon, was not, however, by any means neglected. No inconſiderable advantage was derived from the Doctor's being himſelf a man of taſte, and a maſter of elegant compoſition. Without much direct inſtruction, the remarks which he occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally and frequently made on the beſt writers, ancient and modern, were of great utility. The ſtudents, too, eſpecially thoſe of a claſſical turn, cheriſhed in each other, by their diſcuſſions and debates, the principles of diſcernment with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the beauties of authors, whether in proſe or verſe.</p>
            <p>In the laſt year of Dr. Doddridge's courſe a ſet of lectures was given on preaching and the paſtoral care. Theſe contained directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the method to be taken by the pupils to fit them for appearing with credit in the pulpit; the character of the chief practical divines and commentators; particular rules for the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſtyle, arrangement, and delivery of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; and inſtructions relating to public prayer, expoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> catechiſing, the adminiſtration of the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:025154_0201_0FCE73E4A207EDE8"/>
ſacraments, and viſiting. To theſe were added many general maxims for their converſation and conduct as miniſters, and a variety of prudential hints for their behaviour in the particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and connections in which they might be placed. A regard to truth obliges me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that in theſe lectures, the Doctor carried his ideas of condeſcenſion to the weakneſs, and accommodation to the prejudices, of mankind, farther than ſome perſons will entirely approve. But in ſo doing he acted, I doubt not, with the moſt upright views, and from a ſincere deſire to be uſeful. His ſentiments on this head had been early ſtated by him in his "Free Thoughts on the moſt probable Means of reviving the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Intereſt."</p>
            <p>
               <q>While the ſtudents, ſays Mr. Orton,
were purſuing theſe important ſtudies, ſome lectures were given them on civil law, the hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phics and mythology of the ancients, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh hiſtory, particularly the hiſtory of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity, and the principles on which a ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aration from the church of England is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
Such lectures might, I doubt not, be occaſionally read; but they made no ſtated and regular part of the academical courſe. None of them, excepting thoſe on nonconformity, were delivered during my reſidence at Northampton. I ſpeak with the greater confidence on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as I was never abſent from a ſingle lecture till the laſt month of my courſe, when I was prevented from attending on two or three Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, in conſequence of having been engaged at a diſtance as an occaſional preacher. The health
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:025154_0202_0FCE73E6E2FE6790"/>
which enabled me, and the diligence that led me to maintain this conſtant attendance, I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reflect upon with thankfulneſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>One day in every week was ſet apart for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic exerciſes; at which times the tranſlations and orations of the junior pupils were read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> the young men as had entered on the ſtudy of pneumatology and ethics, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in their turns theſes on the ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects aſſigned them, which were mutually oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and defended.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Thoſe, ſays Mr. Orton,
who had finiſhed ethics delivered ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies (as they were called, to diſtinguiſh them from ſermons) on the natural and moral perfections of GOD, and the ſeveral branches of moral virtue.</q>
But no ſuch homilies, as diſtinct from orations and theſes, occur to my recollection. Indeed, I am convinced that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction did not take place in my time.</note> The ſenior ſtudents brought analyſes of ſcripture, the ſchemes of ſermons, and afterwards the ſermons themſelves, which they ſubmitted to the Doctor's examination and correction; and in this part of his work he was very exact, careful, and friendly; for he eſteemed his remarks on their diſcourſes more uſeful to the young preachers than any general rules of compoſition which could be offered them by thoſe who were themſelves moſt eminent in the profeſſion.</p>
            <p>It was Dr. Doddridge's care, that his pupils, through the whole ſeries of their ſtudies, might have ſuch a variety of lectures weekly, as, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtracting them, would entertain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their minds. While they were attending and ſtudying objects of the greateſt importance, ſome of ſmaller moment, though beneficial in themſelves, were ſet before them at proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:025154_0203_0FCE73E830F6D210"/>
It was contrived that they ſhould have as much to read, between each lecture, as might keep them well employed; due time being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for neceſſary relaxations, and the reading of practical writers. The habitual peruſal of ſuch writers was recommended by their tutor with peculiar energy, and ſingular propriety; for few things can more effectually contribute to improve the underſtanding and mend the heart, and to fit a young man for miniſterial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and uſefulneſs, than a large acquaintance with that moſt valuable part of literature, the great body of Engliſh ſermons, and of compoſitions which have a ſimilar nature and tendency. Dr. Doddridge often examined what books the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents read, beſides thoſe to which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in their lectures, and directed them to ſuch as were beſt ſuited to their age, character, and intended profeſſion. In this reſpect they were very advantageouſly ſituated, as they enjoyed the uſe of a valuable library, conſiſting of ſeveral thouſand volumes. To this library, under ſome prudent regulations, they had acceſs at all times. As their tutor was ſenſible that a numerous collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of books might be a ſnare, rather than a benefit, to the ſtudents, unleſs they had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced friend to direct them in the choice of them, and in the proper period for their being peruſed, he was particularly ſolicitous that they might have ſuitable advice on the ſubject. With this view, he ſometimes gave to his pupils lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on the books in the library; going over the ſeveral ſhelves in order, and informing them of the character of each work, and its author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="206" facs="unknown:025154_0204_0FCE73E9B44A3B00"/>
ſo far as he was known. His obſervations were not only inſtructive but pleaſant; being often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed with anecdotes of the writers who were mentioned. It may be truly ſaid of the lectures on the library, that they diſplayed the ſurpriſing extent of the Doctor's reading and knowledge, and that they were uſeful in a variety of reſpects. My mind ſtill retains, with advantage and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the impreſſion of many of his remarks.</p>
            <p>Dr. Doddridge's manner of lecturing was well adapted to engage the attention and love of his pupils, and to promote their diligent ſtudy of the ſubjects upon which he treated. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them, when they aſſembled in their reſpective claſſes, an account of the reaſonings, demonſtrations, ſcriptures, or facts conſidered in the former lectures and references; and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and encouraged them to propoſe any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which might ariſe in their own minds, or had occurred in the authors they peruſed. If, at any time, their objections were petulant or impertinent, he patiently heard and mildly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them; for he put on no magiſterial airs, but always addreſſed them with the freedom and tenderneſs of a father. He frequently and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged them not to take their ſyſtem of divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from any man or body of men, but from the <hi>Bible.</hi> It was the <hi>Bible</hi> that he always referred and appealed to, upon every point in queſtion, to which it could be ſuppoſed to give any light. The appearances of bigotry and uncharitableneſs were reſolutely checked by him; and he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to cure thoſe who diſcovered any ſymptoms of this kind, by ſhewing them what might be
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:025154_0205_0FCE73EB2F6865F8"/>
ſaid in ſupport of the principles they diſliked, and diſplaying the great learning and excellent characters of many by whom they were eſpouſed.</p>
            <p>It was Dr. Doddridge's great aim to give his pupils juſt and ſublime views of the chriſtian miniſtry, and to lead them to direct all their ſtudies ſo as to increaſe their abilities and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications for that important office. As he was deſirous that they ſhould be very ſerious preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he was particularly anxious that they might have a deep ſenſe of divine things upon their own minds, and be well acquainted with the workings of the human heart with regard to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concerns; and he recommended to them, in the choice of the ſubjects upon which he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in the manner of treating them, to have an eſpecial view to the edification of the bulk of the people. Nor did he think this inconſiſtent with a due attention to the elegance of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That the ſtudents might be qualified to appear with eſteem and honour in the world, and preſide over politer ſocieties with acceptance, he endeavoured to form them to an agreeable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and behaviour. This the oeconomy and decorum of his own family was well calculated to produce. He obſerved, likewiſe, their way of ſpeaking, inſtructed them in the proper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pronunciation, and labored to prevent their contracting any unnatural tone or geſture. While he delivered his cautions upon theſe heads, ſuch was his humility, that he warned them not to imitate himſelf in an error of this kind, of which he was ſenſible, but which he could not entirely correct.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi, ſupra, p. 76—90.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="unknown:025154_0206_0FCE73ECB8F84250"/>Another method taken by Dr. Doddridge, to qualify his pupils for appearing with early ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the pulpit, muſt not be forgotten. The ſenior ſtudents, before they began to preach, were accuſtomed, on the Sunday evenings, to viſit the neigbouring villages, and to hold pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings for religious worſhip in ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed houſes. It was not uncommon for fifty or ſixty, or perhaps a larger number of people, to aſſemble on theſe occaſions. Two of the young men uſually went together; when a practical ſermon was repeated, and one of them prayed before and the other after it, with proper intervals of ſinging. This cuſtom was eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful, both in exerciſing the talents of the pupils, and in preparing them to appear with greater courage and freedom when they entered upon the miniſtry. Sometimes diſtinguiſhed abilities, when accompanied with timidity and baſhfulneſs, have been greatly obſcured from the want of ſuch preparatory exerciſes. The cuſtom was otherwiſe in no ſmall degree beneficial, as it tended to remove prejudices againſt the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to promote the ends of ſerious religion.</p>
            <p>One proof of Dr. Doddridge's zealous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the improvement of his pupils, was, that he allowed them a free acceſs to him in his own ſtudy, to aſk his advice with regard to any part of their courſe, and to mention to him ſuch difficulties as occurred to them either in their private reading or their lectures. In theſe caſes he treated them with the utmoſt candour and tenderneſs, and pointed out whatever he thought would contribute to their advancement in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:025154_0207_0FCE73F20A0FB2E8"/>
While he was thus ſolicitous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their intellectual acquirements, it was his main care, and what he apprehended to be moſt eſſential to their uſefulneſs, that they might be pious and virtuous men. With this view the ſtricteſt regard was paid to their moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and their behaviour, when not employed in their ſtudies or at lecture, was watchfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. Inquiry was made what houſes they frequented, and what company they kept; and none of the ſtudents were permitted to be from home after ten o'clock at night, under penalty of a conſiderable forfeiture. When any thing was found irregular in their conduct, or there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be a danger of their falling into tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the Doctor privately admoniſhed them in the moſt ſerious and affectionate manner. Nor was he ſatisfied with the external decorum of their behaviour, but was anxious to perceive in them the genuine evidences of real religion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 91—96.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Doddridge "often expreſſed his wiſh," ſays Mr. Orton,
<q>that different places of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation could be provided for perſons intended for the miniſtry and thoſe for other profeſſions; as he thought it would be better ſecurity for the religious character of the former; and ſome indulgencies might be allowed to the others, eſpecially thoſe of rank and fortune; that were not proper for divinity ſtudents, as few of them were likely ever to be affluent in their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 101.</note> Much as I revere the memory of my tutor, and ſincere as the reſpect is which I entertain for his judgment on many points, I do
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:025154_0208_0FCE73F3B502FFC8"/>
not agree with him in this opinion. Perhaps it might be delivered by him at ſeaſons of peculiar difficulty and embarraſſment. It is certain that he did not ſtrictly accord with it in his own practice; for he took young gentlemen of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune into his houſe to the end of his life; and during the whole of my pupilage, which was at a time when his academy was in a very flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, I do not recollect that any of the theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical ſtudents were corrupted by the others. There is no poſſibility of forming any plan of education, with regard to which objections may not be made, and inconveniences ſuggeſted. How many diſſertations and treatiſes have been written concerning the queſtion which is moſt preferable, a private or a public education, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having hitherto brought the world to an uniformity of ſentiment upon the ſubject! Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent minds, as they are differently conſtituted, and as particular difficulties ſtrike them, will view matters of this kind in a diverſity of lights. For my own part, all the knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience which I have been able to obtain with reſpect to the point in debate, have convinced me that conſiderable advantages may, and do, ariſe from the connection of lay-pupils with thoſe who are intended for divinity.</p>
            <p>So great was Dr. Doddridge's reputation as a tutor, that the number of his ſtudents was large, being, one year with another, thirty-four; and the academy was uſually on the increaſe. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the twenty-two years in which he ſuſtained this office, he had about two hundred young men under his care, of whom one hundred and
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:025154_0209_0FCE73F4F61CC880"/>
twenty entered upon the miniſtry, and ſome who were deſigned for it died while under his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Several of his pupils were from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Holland. One perſon, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for orders in the church of England, choſe to ſpend a year or two under his tuition, before he went to the Univerſity. Others, whoſe parents were of that church, were placed in the Doctor's family, and were readily allowed to attend the eſtabliſhed worſhip; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>demy was perfectly catholic. Some young divines from Scotland, who had ſtudied and taken the uſual degrees in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, and who had even begun to preach, came to attend his divinity lectures, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his inſtructions, before they ſettled with pariſhes in their native country.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 102, 103.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the manner in which Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge filled up his difficult and honourable ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a tutor; and from this ſurvey of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which might have been extended farther, and which is in certain reſpects more copiouſly dwelt upon by Mr. Orton, every pious and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious reader will acknowledge the wiſdom and goodneſs of Providence, in raiſing up ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a perſon, and preparing him for ſo large a ſphere of uſefulneſs.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 104.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Orton takes notice that Dr. Doddridge's method of education bears a near reſemblance to other ſeminaries of the like kind, among the Proteſtant Diſſenters.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 74<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> But it is proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, of late years, there has been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:025154_0210_0FCE73F6EA67E560"/>
enlargement of the plan upon which ſeveral of them have been conſtructed. The academy at Warrington was formed on the ſcheme of three independent <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> as they might juſtly be entitled; and when we mention among them (not to name other reſpectable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) ſuch men as Dr. Taylor, Dr. Aikin, Dr. Prieſtley, Dr. Reinhold Forſter, Mr. Gilbert Wakefield, and Dr. Enfield, we need not ſay how ably it was in ſucceſſion ſupplied. The inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution at Hoxton was on the ſame foundation; Dr. Savage, Dr. Rees, and myſelf, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and unſubordinate tutors in theological, mathematical, and philological departments. A ſimilar arrangement takes place at the ſeminary of our congregational brethren in Homerton. The new college at Hackney has gone upon the plan of a ſtill greater number of preceptors. Though the academy heretofore at Daventry, and ſince removed to Northampton, and that at Mancheſter, retain the form of one principal tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, there are two ſeparate aſſiſtants for the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical and claſſical ſtudies.</p>
            <p>May I be permitted to offer a brief ſketch of theological education? A ſolid foundation ought to be laid in a truly grammatical acquaintance with the Latin and Greek tongues; and the higher claſſical writers ſhould be read, more or leſs, through the whole courſe. Hebrew at leaſt, amongſt the Oriental languages, ſhould by no means be neglected. The different branches of mathematical literature, and of natural philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, will demand a ſerious and diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Logic, metaphyſics, univerſal grammar,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:025154_0211_0FCE73FAD8D19F58"/>
rhetoric, criticiſm, chronology, and hiſtory, are objects an acquaintance with which is not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle deſirable. With reſpect to general divinity, including in that term pneumatology and ethics, I cannot help thinking that Dr. Doddridge's courſe of lectures, with proper additions, improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and references to more recent authors, might ſtill be made uſe of with eminent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. As it points out, in order, the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant objects of ſtudy, and the writers on both ſides of the queſtions diſcuſſed, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ng man will know where to apply for future informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Jewiſh antiquities and eccleſiaſtical hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry need ſcarcely to be mentioned, as they cannot be forgotten. If the ſyſtems of the ancient phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſhould be thought to merit much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard during academical ſtudies, ample materials may be collected from Dr. Enfield's late moſt valuable work. A ſeries of lectures on the divine diſpenſations would be peculiarly uſeful. Such a ſet of lectures was begun by Dr. Taylor at Warrington, but he did not live to complete the deſign. His work, ſo far as it was carried, is worthy of approbation, though the diſcourſes are ſometimes rather too declamatory, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not ſufficiently accurate and critical. They have, however, deſervedly found a place in the Biſhop of Landaff's Collection of Theological Tracts. Another thing of conſequence is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of obſervations on the times and occaſions on which the books, eſpecially of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were written, the ancient copies and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the principal commentators. The objects I particularly allude to, are thoſe which
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:025154_0212_0FCE73FC709C6D70"/>
are particularly treated of by Michaelis, Lardner, Jones, and Campbell. In addition to all theſe, a ſet of preaching lectures, more improved than thoſe of Dr. Doddridge, and more adapted to preſent circumſtances, would be an important acquiſition. With the beſt inſtruction, it is not to be expected that all young men ſhould be equally accompliſhed. It will be ſufficient for many that they have a competent ſtock of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, united with ſerious dipoſitions. It is, however, very deſirable that ſome ſhould ſo far riſe above the common rank, as to be able, in their day, to ſupport the honour of revelation againſt the attacks of its enemies, and to appear as defenders of the true chriſtian doctrines. It would not be amiſs, if a few, of ſuperior capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and literature, would, after they quit the ſeminaries of education, ſtudy ſomewhat more ſyſtematically than is frequently done. In that caſe, the diſſenters would not be at a loſs for tutors in peculiar emergencies. If I have aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too great a liberty in ſuggeſting theſe hints, I hope to be forgiven; as I have written not merely from a regard to the honour and benefit of the denomination of chriſtians to which I more immediately belong, but with a view to the general intereſts of religion and learning.</p>
            <p>Since the abilities of Mr. Doddridge were ſuch as called him ſo early in life to the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant office of a theological tutor, it was natural to expect, from the ſame talents, that it would not be long before he appeared in the world as an author. His firſt diſtinct publication, which was in 1730, and printed without his name,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:025154_0213_0FCE73FDF503CAE8"/>
was entitled,
<q>Free Thoughts on the moſt probable Means of reviving the Diſſenting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, occaſioned by the late Enquiry into the Cauſes of its Decay.</q>
The writer of the Enquiry was for a time ſuppoſed to be ſome lay-gentleman; but, in fact, it came from the pen of a young diſſenting miniſter, of the name of Gough, who afterwards conformed to the church; and who, in 1750, publiſhed a volume of ſermons, which have conſiderable merit as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and elegant compoſitions. Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's pamphlet, wherein he materially differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Mr. Gough with regard to the point in queſtion, is a model of that candour and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which remarks may be made on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's writings and opinions. The firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which Mr. Doddridge diſtinguiſhed himſelf as a practical divine was in 1732, when he publiſhed
<q>Sermons on the Education of Children.</q>
Theſe were principally intended for the uſe of his own congregation; and they contain, in a little compaſs, a variety of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant advices and affecting motives, tending to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and animate parents in the diſcharge of ſo momentous a duty. They were accompanied with a recommendatory preface by Mr. Some, and have ſince gone through ſeveral editions. In 1735, Mr. Doddridge's concern for the riſing generation was ſtill farther diſplayed, in "Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to young People;" being ſeven in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and which have met with equal ſucceſs in the world. A diſcourſe was printed by him in the ſame year entitled, "The Care of the Soul urged as the One Thing needful," This was
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:025154_0214_0FCE73FF6B2D8EF0"/>
followed, in 1735-6, by a Sermon on the "Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity and Iniquity of Perſecution for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-Sake, in all its Forms and Degrees." It had been preached, I believe, on the preceding fifth of November, and, when it came from the preſs, was recommended to the public, in a ſhort preface, by Mr. Some, as the beſt he had ever ſeen on the ſubject, in ſo narrow a compaſs. In all reſpects it is indeed an elaborate and excellent diſcourſe, diſplaying with great energy and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance the grand principles of toleration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberty.</p>
            <p>In the year 1736 the two Colleges of the Univerſity of Aberdeen, in Scotland, concurred in conferring upon Mr. Doddridge the degree of Doctor in Divinity; upon which occaſion his pupils thought it a proper piece of reſpect to congratulate him in a body. He was gratified by their compliment, but told them, in anſwer to it,
<q>that their learning, piety, and zeal, would be more to his honour, and give him a thouſand times more pleaſure, than his degree, or any other token of public eſteem.</q>
In the ſame year he publiſhed
<q>Ten Sermons on the Power and Grace of Chriſt,</q>
and
<q>the Evidences of his glorious Goſpel.</q>
The three laſt, on the "Evidences of the Goſpel," were afterwards ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arately printed, at the particular requeſt of one of the firſt dignitaries of the church of England. They contain a very judicious ſummary of ſeveral of the principal arguments in ſupport of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian revelation, and eſpecially of thoſe which prove the genuineneſs and credibility of the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical hiſtory. The author had the great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:025154_0215_0FCE740449A711C0"/>
of knowing that theſe diſcourſes were the means of converting to the belief of our holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion two gentlemen of liberal education and diſtinguiſhed abilities, who had been ſceptical upon this head. One of them, who had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prejudice others againſt the evidences and contents of the goſpel, became a zealous preacher of chriſtianity, as well as a ſhining or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to it in his life and manners.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 98, 112, 117, 118.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Doddridge's next appearance from the preſs was on an occaſion very melancholy and affecting to himſelf and Mrs Doddridge. This was the loſs of his eldeſt daughter, a very amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hopeful child of nearly five years of age. The ſermon which he preached on this event, and which was publiſhed in 1736-7, is entitled, "Submiſſion to Divine Providence on the Death of Children, recommended and enforced." It is an admirable diſcourſe, which diſplays in a very ſtrong and ſtriking light the united piety and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of the author's mind. Few ſuperior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of pathetic eloquence are to be met with in the Engliſh language. In 1737 the Doctor engaged in an ordination ſervice at Wiſbeach St. Peter's, in the Iſle of Ely. The part alloted him was the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was printed under the title of "The Temper and Conduct of the primitive Miniſters of the Goſpel illuſtrated and recommended." Mr. William Johnſton, the gentleman ordained, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards removed to Harborough, and at length ſettled at Tunbridge-Wells, at which place he died, and where he was well known and juſtly reſpected by many conſiderable perſons. He
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:025154_0216_0FCE7405F5AA6F10"/>
was the author of a pronouncing and ſpelling Dictionary, which appeared in 12mo, in 1764, and which was not, in ſome reſpects, without its utility. It is now, I believe, entirely ſuperſeded by the far more elaborate and perfect works of Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Walker. Dr. Doddridge, in 1737-8, was called to officiate at the funeral of an old and worthy friend, the Rev. Mr. John Norris, of Welford in Northamptonſhire, who had been thirty-eight years diſſenting miniſter at that place. The diſcourſe which the Doctor preached, and printed, on the occaſion, is enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled,
<q>Practical Reflections on the Character and Death of Enoch.</q>
On the ninth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1738, a day of faſting and prayer was obſerved at Wellingborough, on account of a dreadful fire which had deſtroyed a conſiderable part of the town; and the ſermon, which was aſſigned to Dr. Doddridge, and was in part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered extempore, was publiſhed, from the beſt recollection he could make of it, at the earneſt requeſt of the hearers.</p>
            <p>In 1739, our author gave to the public the firſt volume, in quarto, of his great work,
<q>The Family Expoſitor; or, a Paraphraſe and Verſion of the New Teſtament: with criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notes, and a practical Improvement of each Section.</q>
This volume contained the former part of the Hiſtory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as recorded in the four Evangeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the order of an harmony, and was uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the world by a very numerous and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable liſt of ſubſcribers. The dedication, which was to her Royal Highneſs the Princeſs
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:025154_0217_0FCE7406E98662E8"/>
of Wales, affords one of the fineſt ſpecimens which Dr. Doddridge has given of his talents in elegant compoſition. If the praiſes ſhould be thought ſufficiently copious, they are, at the ſame time, mixed with important hints of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and nothing appears to be ſaid but what evidently came from the heart. The ſecond volume of the work was publiſhed in 1740, concluding the evangelical hiſtory. During theſe two years, the Doctor printed only one ſermon, which was on the
<q>Neceſſity of a general Reformation in order to a well grounded Hope of Succeſs in War;</q>
and which had been preached by him at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, on the ninth of January, 1739-40, being the day appointed by his Majeſty for public humiliation. It was dedicated to his friend Colonel Gardiner. In 1741, our author was called upon to pay a tribute of reſpect to the memory of a worthy diſſenting min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter in London, the Rev. Mr. John Newman, by delivering an oration at his grave, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards committing it to the preſs. Soon after, he publiſhed
<q>The Scripture Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Grace through Faith, illuſtrated and improved in two Sermons, the ſubſtance of which was preached at Rowell in Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire.</q>
But the principal production of Dr. Doddridge, during this year, was a ſet of "Practical Diſcourſes on Regeneration," which had been delivered on Sunday evenings, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with remarkable diligence, by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of different perſuations, to ſome of whom they were eminetly uſeful. The character given
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:025154_0218_0FCE74086AC81A48"/>
of them by a foreign divine, on their being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Dutch, among other high encomiums, was, that they united orthodoxy with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, zeal with meekneſs, and deep, hidden wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with uncommon clearneſs; that ſimplicity ſhone in them without coldneſs, elegance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out painting, and ſublimity without bombaſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>The publication of theſe diſcourſes was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by that of a ſingle ſermon, entitled,
<q>The Evil and Danger of neglecting the Souls of Men plainly and ſeriouſly repreſented.</q>
It had been preached in October, 1741, at a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miniſters, at Kettering in Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. When publiſhed, which was in Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1741-2, it was dedicated to the aſſociated Proteſtant Diſſenting Miniſters in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, with whom the author had an interview at Denton, in the preceding ſummer, and to whom he had propoſed a ſcheme for the revival of religion, the heads of which are given in the dedication. The only compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from the pulpit which was printed by Dr. Doddridge in 1742, was a Charge, delivered in St. Ives Huntingdonſhire, on the twelfth of Auguſt, at the ordination of Mr. John Jennings, the ſon of the Doctor's former tutor. In the latter end of the ſame year, our author began the publication of the ſole controverſial work in which he could properly ever have been ſaid to have engaged. This was occaſioned by a pamphlet, entitled, "Chriſtianity not founded on argument," which was much ſpoken of at the time of its appearance, and which, under
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:025154_0219_0FCE740D370CDD70"/>
the form of a zeal for orthodoxy, contained a ſevere attack on our holy religion. Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's anſwer was compriſed in three letters, the ſecond and third of which were publiſhed in 1743. In the firſt he ſtated the degree of rational evidence for the divine authority of chriſtianity, to which an illiterate, well diſpoſed perſon may attain. The ſecond was employed in endeavoring to ſhew the reaſonableneſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing a condemnatory ſentence on unbelievers, as a part of the chriſtian revelation. In the third the doctrine of divine influences was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.<note n="*" place="bottom">Doddridge's Letters, p <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </note> Theſe anſwers, which are written with the utmoſt politeneſs and candour, met with a very favourable reception in the world, and the Doctor was thanked for them by ſome men of diſtinguiſhed rank and abilities. The laſt letter in particular was eſteemed by many thinking perſons to contain the beſt illuſtration and the moſt rational and full defence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit upon the human heart, which had hitherto been publiſhed. <note n="†" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The ſucceſs of the deſign was much owing to his exertions. His diſcourſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of it, which was dedicated to the Earl of Halifax, is indeed a moſt excellent one, and was characteriſed by Dr. Oliver, in a letter to the author, as follows:

            <p>Towards the cloſe of the ſame year, Dr. Doddridge became a member of a Philoſophical Society which was formed at Northampton, conſiſting of ſeveral ingenious and reſpectable gentlemen in that town and its neighbourhood. During the courſe of their meetings in 1744, he exhibited two papers, the one on the Doctrine of Pendulums, and the other on the Laws of Communication of Motion, as well in elaſtic as in non-elaſtic bodies. The moſt material pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions relating to both were ſet in ſo plain and eaſy a light in theſe papers, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to permit tranſcripts of them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited among other communications of the gentlemen concerned, ſome of which appear to have been curious and uſeful.<note n="†" place="bottom">Gentleman's Magazine, vol. xvi. p. 475—477</note> Our author's name occurs in the Tranſactions of the Royal Society. Three papers were written and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by him to that ſociety, which, if they were not of the firſt conſequence, ſerve to ſhow the activity of his mind, and his attention to different branches of ſcience.</p>
            <p>The year 1745, was diſtinguiſhed in Dr. Doddridge's life by the appearance of one of the moſt popular and one of the moſt uſeful of his practical works. This was "The Riſe and Progreſs of Religion in the Soul," illuſtrated in a courſe of ſerious addreſſes, ſuited to perſons of every character and circumſtance, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout meditation or prayer added to each chapter.

Dr. Watts had formed a ſimilar deſign; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been prevented from the execution of it by his growing infirmities, he recommended it to our author, as the beſt qualified of all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance for diſcharging it in the manner that would be acceptable and beneficial to the world. It was with ſome reluctance that Dr. Doddridge, amidſt his various other weighty concerns, agreed to comply with the requeſt of his venerable friend; but it was urged with an importunity that he could not reſiſt; and he had afterwards the higheſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to rejoice in his compliance. When the work was finiſhed, Dr. Watts reviſed as much of it as his health would permit. This book was not only well received by the diſſenters, but met with an equal reception, and the warmeſt applauſes, from ſeveral perſons of great emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence for rank, learning, and piety, both clergy and laity, in the eſtabliſhed church.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 119, 120.</note> Dr. Ayſcough, formerly preceptor to the children of Frederic Prince of Wales, ſpeaking of it, ſays,

<q>With our thanks for the favour of your good company, be pleaſed to accept of our moſt hearty acknowledgments for your kind preſent of your excellent piece on the Riſe and Progreſs of Religion in the Soul: a performance which cannot fail of doing much good in the world, as it is judiciouſly contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to engage the attention, and improve the minds of all ſorts of readers; being ſo plain as to be intelligible to the loweſt underſtanding, at the ſame time that it is ſo elegant, as to gratify the higheſt. You may aſſure yourſelf, Sir, that it was not in the power of my moſt preſſing engagements to hinder me from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a work as this, and I hope I am much the better for having done ſo. Nor would it have been kind to my dear Mrs. Hunt, not to have given her an opportunity of peruſing a book, from which I myſelf had received ſo much benefit. I therefore no ſooner laid it out of my own hands, but I put it into her's, where I afterwards oftentimes found it, and cannot eaſily tell you how much ſhe was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by it, nor deſcribe the gratitude ſhe profeſſes to owe to her worthy inſtructor.</q>

with my poor Lord, when an old acquaintance of mine, the Dowager Lady Hyndford, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me to read the Riſe and Progreſs of Religion in the Soul; and I may with truth aſſure you, that I never was ſo deeply affected with any thing I ever met with as with that book; and I could not be eaſy till I had given one to every ſervant in my houſe, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be of a ſerious turn of mind.</q>

This might ſuffice for me to ſay concerning a book that is ſo univerſally admired by thoſe to whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and piety I pay the greateſt reverence; and all perhaps that in prudence I ought to ſay; if I merely conſulted the preſerving that credit you have hitherto been ſo kind as to give to my underſtanding. But as I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerve your friendſhip than gain your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and be eſteemed injudicious than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere, I will venture (ſince you have deſired it) to ſend a remark or two on this perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Your book propoſes to draw a plan of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious diſpoſition, or habit, from its firſt foundation to its higheſt perfection in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate; and to conſider it in its various ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and circumſtances, agreeably to that varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which there is in the circumſtances and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of chriſtians. But is it not a juſt objection to this performance, if there are many chriſtians who are conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:025154_0226_0FCE741F07A46BC0"/>
that the foundation of their religious temper and practice was not laid in thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and that view of things which you there deſcribe? Which I ſuppoſe muſt be the caſe of thoſe who do not in a good degree embrace the Calviniſtical doctrines, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of many that do: for I am inclined to think, that different principles do not more variouſly affect and influence the minds of men, than the ſame principles do different minds, eſpecially young ones, according to the firmneſs or weakneſs of the mind, or as the prevailing turn is ſprightly or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. Conſidering, therefore, the ſtate of the chriſtian church univerſally, may it not be reaſonable to allow a greater variety in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, which divine wiſdom and mercy take, to bring ſinful men to the love and practice of religion? You will obſerve, the objection does not infer, that the method you preſcribe is not the moſt general, or the beſt adapted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and carry on the chriſtian life in the ſoul of man, but whether it be the only one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If I might venture to add another remark, it ſhould be this: whether your rules and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for promoting the chriſtian life do not require more time to be ſpent in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of devotion and in the inſtrumental du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of religion, than is conſiſtent with that attention to the affairs of this life, which is neceſſary for the generality of chriſtians; and whether the propoſing more to be done than can (from a view of the capacities and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of chriſtians in general) be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:025154_0227_0FCE7420847CF4D0"/>
ſhould be done, may not diſcourage ſome not to attempt, and others not to proceed in a courſe of religion? What is fit to be done by ſome perſons, and in ſome ſpecial circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, may not be expected from the greater number of chriſtians: and care ſhould be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, that the heights of piety, to which ſome devout ſouls have ſoared, do not become mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diſcouragement to young chriſtians, or thoſe of an ordinary rank.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not improbable that I, who read over this book with a view and deſire to diſcover and amend my own faults, and not to find any in that, may not have ſufficiently attended to ſome paſſages that may ſhow both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks impertinent; or if there are not ſuch paſſages in this book, I myſelf can point out to ſome in other of your pieces (particularly that on Regeneration, if my memory does not greatly fail me) which guard againſt both theſe objections in very clear and expreſs terms. But whatever be the fate of my remarks, when I venture to attack the accuracy of your compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, I have a ſure and tried retreat in the candour and benevolence of your diſpoſition, which conceals all the weakneſſes of your friends; and, I ſpeak it from my own repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed experience, magnifies any well-intentioned attempt into an act or evidence of conſpicuous wiſdom or virtue.</q>

<q>Many thanks to you for your excellent ſermon on the death of the valiant and worthy Colonel Gardiner.

            <p>Dr. Doddridge's next appearance from the preſs was, likewiſe, in a funeral diſcourſe, which was preached at Northampton, in May, 1746, on occaſion of the death of the Rev. Mr. James Shepherd. Mr. Shepherd was a worthy young miniſter, not quite twenty-two years of age, who died, in conſequence of a ſhort illneſs, ſoon after he had finiſhed his academical ſtudies, and had received an invitation to the paſtoral charge of a diſſenting congregation at Coggeſhall, in Eſſex. Nine ſermons, the whole which he had ever
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:025154_0230_0FCE74279F5583D0"/>
made, were collected together, and printed in a ſmall volume, 1748.</p>
            <p>In 1747, Dr. Doddridge, agreeably to the promiſe he had before made, publiſhed "Some remarkable paſſages in the Life of the Hon. Col. James Gardiner;" a work which has gone thro' various editions. It was the author's deſign, in this work, not merely to perform a tribute of gratitude to the memory of an invaluable friend, but of duty to GOD and his fellow-creatures; as he had a cheerful hope that the narrative would, under the divine bleſſing, be the means of ſpreading a warm and lively ſenſe of religion. Several of the Doctor's literary correſpondents thought highly of the performance. "I own," ſays Mr. Barker,
<q>I was not without my fears, leſt your love to that excellent perſon ſhould have overcharged ſome of your paſſages with panegyric; and the extraordinary manner of his converſion have given ſome occaſion to the preſent age to charge him or you with enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm. But in reading the book I was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſurpriſed and exceedingly pleaſed; and have the ſatisfaction to acquaint you, that your friends here are of opinion that you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what you have undertaken in a moſt excellent manner, and that it is ſuited to do a great deal of good.<note n="†" place="bottom">Letters, ubi ſupra, p. 109, 110.</note>
               </q> Mr. Neal, who wrote to the author before he had read the whole work, expreſſed himſelf in the following terms.
<q>The receipt of Colonel Gardiner's Life calls upon me for a particular acknowledgment. I have yet only had the pleaſure of reading ſome part
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:025154_0231_0FCE742905DFD478"/>
of it; and though I know you would rather ſee me improved by it, than hear me commend it, yet as the latter will, I hope, be no obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the former, I muſt own that, as far as I have gone, I think it is writen in a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and entertaining manner; and I was charmed with the dedication, the concluding period of which is worthy the eloquence and politeneſs of Pliny, and the piety and energy of St. Paul. But I will ſay no more till I have peruſed the whole piece.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 370.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be thought ſomewhat remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the learned Warburton ſhould expreſs the moſt unqualified approbation of the whole work. "I had the favour," ſays this eminent writer,
<q>of your letter, and along with it Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Gardiner's life, which I have juſt read through with very great pleaſure. Nothing can be better or more judicious than the writing part. Many conſiderations made the ſubject of great importance and expediency. The celebration of worthy men who ſacrificed themſelves for the ſervice of their country; the tribute paid to private friendſhip; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, particularly to the ſoldiery, of ſo much virtue and piety, as well as courage and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm; the ſervice done to the ſurvivors of their families, are ſuch important conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as equally concern the writer and the public. I had a thouſand things to remark in it which gave me pleaſure. But I have room but for two or three. The diſtinction you ſettle between piety and enthuſiaſm in the 78th

I entirely agree with your ſentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the extraordinary circumſtance of the good man's converſion. On the whole, the book will do you honour; or what you like better, will be a bleſſing to you by its becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inſtrument of public good.</q>

            <p>The chief obſervation that Mr. Orton makes on the work is, that
<q>the author had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to hear of ſome inſtances in which it had anſwered his deſires and hopes; though many thought, and perhaps juſtly, that he too much indulged the emotions of private friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and affection in the compoſition.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 114.</note> In the truth of this remark I entirely concur. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Gardiner was indeed a man of a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent character; but that character was tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with enthuſiaſm and religious bigotry. His virtues were of the awful kind. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber well that his aſpect was the aſpect of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but this dignity was mixed with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of appearance and manner, which was not prepoſſeſſing to the minds of the ſtudents belonging to the academy at Northampton.

The affection of his eldeſt ſon to his father, had, I know, more of fear united with it than is uſually deſirable in a child towards a parent. Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge undoubtedly went too far, when, in his funeral ſermon for Colonel Gardiner, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately declared, that it was hard for him to ſay where, but in the book of GOD, the Colonel <hi>found his example,</hi> or where he had <hi>left his equal.</hi>

            <p>It is not my deſign to enter ſpecifically into the ſtory of Colonel Gardiner's extraordinary converſion. That the impreſſion made upon his mind was in a dream, is ſufficiently intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the opinion of Dr. Doddridge, though the Colonel himſelf believed it to be a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous viſion. As a dream it may very rationally be accounted for, from the prediſpoſing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. He had received a ſtrictly pious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; he had never rejected the principles, though he had departed from the practice of chriſtianity; he often felt the anguiſh of his courſe of life; he was alone, in the ſolemn ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night; a religious book happened to be opened by him; the dreadful crime in which he was going to engage flaſhed upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Falling aſleep in this agitation of his ſpirits, a dream followed, accommodated to his waking reflections. Nor was he, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the leſs indebted to the goodneſs of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

Providence for the happy and effectual change that was produced in his diſpoſition and conduct. The events which are derived thro' a ſucceſſion of intermediate cauſes, are not leſs the reſult of the adminiſtration of the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than more immediate interpoſitions.

            <p>Two pamphlets were publiſhed, containing remarks on the Life of Colonel Gardiner; one in London, and the other at Edinburgh.

            <p>In the year 1748 appeared the third volume of the
<q>Family Expoſitor, containing the Acts of the Apoſtles, with additional Notes on the Harmony of the Evangeliſts;</q>
and
<q>Two Diſſertations, 1. On Sir Iſaac Newton's Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of the Harmony. 2. On the Inſpiration of the New Teſtament.</q>
This volume is a very valuable part of Dr. Doddridge's great work; being executed with ſingular attention and diligence, and comprehending a large va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of curious and important critical remarks, together with excellent practical obſervations. In ſeveral momentous particulars he differed from Lord Barrington and Dr. Benſon, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incided in opinion with Dr. Lardner. Of this the latter gentleman took the following notice in a letter to our author.
<q>You have happily
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:025154_0235_0FCE743111671400"/>
thrown a great deal of light on the Acts of the Apoſtles. I am particularly obliged to you for the honourable mention you have been pleaſed to make of me upon many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I likewiſe thank you for aſſerting and confirming the opinion that the Jews had not <hi>Jus Gladii</hi> in the time of our Saviour. I am alſo well pleaſed to ſee how clear you keep of the now common opinion about <hi>Proſelytes of the Gate,</hi> and how you ſometimes overthrow it by good reaſons.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters, ubi ſupra, p. 273.</note> In the diſſertation on Sir Iſaac Newton's ſcheme for reducing the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral hiſtories contained in the Evangeliſts to their proper order, Dr. Doddridge ſucceſsfully combats Sir Iſaac's hypotheſis upon the ſubject. But, at the ſame time, he gladly embraced the opportunity of paying him a very fine compliment. "I cannot," ſays the Doctor,
<q>ſet myſelf to this taſk, without feeling the fatigue of it ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly allayed, by the pleaſure with which I reflect on the firm perſuaſion which a perſon of his unequalled ſagacity muſt have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the truth of chriſtianity, in order to his being engaged to take ſuch pains in illuſtrating the ſacred oracles. A pleaſure, which I doubt not every good reader will ſhare with me; eſpecially as (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the beſt information, whether public or private, I could ever get) his firm faith in the divine revelation diſcovered itſelf in the moſt genuine fruits of ſubſtantial virtue and piety; and conſequently gives us the juſteſt reaſon to conclude, that he is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:025154_0236_0FCE743268DC1D10"/>
in the happy effects of it infinitely more than in all the applauſe which his phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical works have procured him; though they have commanded a fame laſting as the world, the true theory of which he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and (in ſpite of all the vain efforts of ignorance, pride, and their offspring bigotry) have arrayed him as it were in the beams of the ſun, and inſcribed his name among the conſtellations of heaven.</q>
Concerning Dr. Doddridge's Diſſertation on the Inſpiration of the Old Teſtament, Warburton pronounced, that it is a well reaſoned and judicious perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>The only ſermon publiſhed by Dr. Doddridge in 1748, was one entitled, "Chriſt's Invitation to thirſty Souls." It had been preached nearly twenty years before at Northampton, and was now printed at the requeſt of a worthy member of the eſtabliſhed church, to whom it had been communicated in the intimacy of friendſhip. Prefixed to it is a dedication, of conſiderable length, to the Rev. James Harvey. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, if I conjecture rightly, did not pleaſe the ſtrong-minded Warburton. "I think," ſays he,
<q>you do not ſet a juſt value on your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when you lend your name or countenance to ſuch weak, but well-meaning rhapſodies as —. This may do well enough with the people; but it is the learned that claim you.
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:025154_0237_0FCE7434AD8A7668"/>
And though the intermixing with works of this caſt <hi>ſober</hi> books of devotion of your own compoſing, becomes your character, and is indeed your duty, yet your charity and love of goodneſs ſuffer you to let yourſelf down in the opinion of thoſe you moſt value, and whoſe high opinion you have fairly gained by works of learning and reaſoning inferior to none. Forgive me this freedom.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 205<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 206.</note> Dr. Hunt thought better, and indeed more juſtly, of the dedication; for he thus expreſſed himſelf, in a letter to the author:
<q>Many thanks to you for your kind preſent of your excellent ſermon. You have done great honour to our brother Harvey in the dedication, which breathes the true ſpirit of chriſtian benevolence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſuch generous and charitable ſentiments as muſt charm every reader that has any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the true intereſts of our moſt holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. I think the account you give of the occaſion of the words (which is ſomething in my way) is perfectly juſt, and the method in which you have explained and carried on the metaphor throughout, is in the higheſt degree beautiful, as well as inſtructive.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 346, 347.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt publication of Dr. Doddridge in 1749 was,
<q>A plain and ſerious Addreſs to a Maſter of a Family on the important Subject of Family Religion.</q>
This was accompanied with two prayers; one, which might be uſed as an introduction to a ſtated courſe of family-prayer, where it had formerly been neglected; and the other, a prayer for a family, to be uſed
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:025154_0238_0FCE7439AF4FD100"/>
either morning or evening, with ſuch variations as might eaſily be underſtood by any who were able to read it. The Doctor, though a diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and himſelf excelling in the variety and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſneſs of more extemporaneous adorations, was not, we ſee, averſe to forms of prayer on proper occaſions. Indeed, he recommends them in his "Addreſs," the ſeriouſneſs, affection, and momentous nature of which entitle it to great attention and regard. The next appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our author from the preſs was in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that had been preached at Northampton on the twenty-fifth of April, 1749; being the day appointed by his Majeſty for a general thankſgiving on account of the peace concluded with France and Spain. It was entitled,
<q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the Conduct of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Series and Concluſion of the late War,</q>
and contains many beautiful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant obſervations, adapted to the circumſtances of the time.</p>
            <p>In 1749-50, Dr. Doddridge preached, at a meeting of miniſters at Creaton in Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſhire, and afterwards publiſhed a ſermon, the title of which is,
<q>Chriſtian Candour and Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity ſtated, illuſtrated, and urged.</q>
This is an admirable diſcourſe, and exhibits a fine tranſcript of the author's own mind, which was fully attuned to the virtue he recommended. It was inſcribed to the Counteſs of Huntingdon, and ſtrongly diſplay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the twentieth of Auguſt, 1750, Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge preached a ſermon at Salter's-Hall, on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the late alarm by the ſecond ſhock of an earthquake, which had happened on the eighth of March preceding. The diſcourſe being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:025154_0240_0FCE743C2F4F6B70"/>
to a very large and attentive auditory, it was earneſtly requeſted that it might be printed; and accordingly it appeared under the title of
<q>The Guilt and Doom of Capernaum ſeriouſly recommended to the Conſideration of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of London.</q>
Both the ſermon and the preface amply ſhow how ſolicitous our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was, with many other good men, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove every event of Divine Providence to the beſt of purpoſes. In the December of the ſame year, he was called upon to pay the laſt tribute of reſpect to the memory of his friend and father, Dr. Clark. That gentleman died on the fourth of the month, and on the ſixteenth Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge preached his funeral ſermon at St. Alban's. The diſcourſe is entitled,
<q>Meditations on the Tears of Jeſus over the Grave of Lazarus;</q>
and the character given of Dr. Clark is as juſt as it is affectionate. It may not be improper to mention, that Dr. Clark was the author of a collection of Scripture Promiſes, which has been very uſeful to many pious chriſtians, and of three excellent Sermons, on the Nature and Cauſes of Irreſolution in Religion, printed in 1742. As a proof of the liberality of his mind, I ſhall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a paſſage from one of his letters, written in 1727, to Mr. Doddridge.
<q>You have ſeen, I ſuppoſe, what the public prints inform us of, relating to the proceedings of the General Aſſembly in Scotland, againſt Mr. Patrick Simpſon. They are going to deprive that church of one of the moſt valuable perſons in it, becauſe he does not think it neceſſary to tie himſelf down exactly to their Shibboleth, nor
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:025154_0241_0FCE743DA9FB0648"/>
oblige himſelf to conform to all the ſcholaſtic ways of ſpeaking, concerning ſome things, about which the ſcripture is ſilent. By what I ſaw and heard of him when in Scotland, he is a much better judge of thoſe matters than the greater part of thoſe who are to judge him. His crime is, that he is diſpoſed to think for himſelf; but yet he is very cautious to avoid giving offence, which I perceive is, by the bigots, interpreted cunning and diſſimulation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>One would think the experience of ſo many ages ſhould be ſufficient to make the world wiſer; and that thoſe who pretend to govern in the church ſhould learn at laſt that their power might be much better exerciſed, than in deſtroying the uſefulneſs of the beſt men in it, merely for nice ſpeculations about unreveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſputable points. Suppoſe a perſon ſhould not ſpeak with exact propriety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of Chriſt's exiſtence, a point ſo much above our reach, if yet he loves him, truſts in him, and ſincerely obeys him, what harm does religion ſuffer by it? But I need not enlarge upon this to you, who are ſo well inſtructed in the unreaſonableneſs of bigotry to a ſet of ſpeculative notions.</q>

            <p>I have now ſpecified the works that were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Dr. Doddridge during his life time, in their chronological order, which has been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected by Mr. Orton, and very much confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the three volumes containing the Doctor's Sermons and religious Tracts. Such of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings as were printed after his deceaſe will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:025154_0242_0FCE74400730D9D0"/>
be mentioned; and, therefore, it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains at preſent to be added, that he was the author of a few ſmall pieces which appeared in other collections. Theſe were, ſome papers, when he was a young man, in "The preſent State of the Republic of Letters;" a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory Preface to a performance, entitled,
<q>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Dialogues for Children;</q>
a biographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Preface to twelve Sermons, by the Rev. Thomas Steffe, a diſſenting miniſter and former pupil, who died in early life, at Taunton in Somerſetſhire; an elaborate account, in
<q>The Hiſtory of the Works of the Learned,</q>
of the ſecond volume of Warburton's divine Legation of Moſes; and an elegant practical Paraphraſe of the laſt Words of David, according to the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal interpretation of Dr. Richard Grey, of Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Northamptonſhire.</p>
            <p>I ought to have taken notice under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per year (1748) that Dr. Doddridge reviſed the "Expoſitory Works" and other remains of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Leighton, and tranſlated his "Latin Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections." Theſe were printed together at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, in two volumes. Though the preparing of theſe volumes for the preſs took up ſome of the Doctor's time for ſeveral months, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of other buſineſs, he was far from repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his labour. The delight and edification which he found in the writings of this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man, were eſteemed by him to be a full equivalent for his pains; ſeparately from all the proſpect of that effect which they might have upon others. He acknowledges in his preface, that he never ſpent a quarter of an hour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewing
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:025154_0243_0FCE7443AFE04190"/>
any of them, without feeling, amidſt the interruption which a critical examination of the copy would naturally give, ſome impreſſions which he wiſhed always to retain. Indeed, he found in them ſuch heart-affecting leſſons of ſimplicity and humility, candour and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and of exalted piety, without the leaſt tincture of enthuſiaſm, as he thought could ſcarcely be equalled any where elſe, excepting in the ſacred Oracles.*</p>
            <p>Dr. Henry Miles, of Tooting, ſpeaking of Archbiſhop Leighton's works, ſaid, in a letter to Dr. Doddridge,
<q>I bleſs GOD I ever met with them. There is a ſpirit in them I never met with in any human writings, nor can I read many lines in them without being affected: though you know all his works are imperfect and inaccurate.</q>† Scotland, in the middle of the laſt century, produced ſome divines, who had imbibed, in a wonderful manner, the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine ſpirit of devotion, and the genuine ſpirit of chriſtianity. The name of Scougal will occur to every one who is tolerably acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either with the hiſtory of theology, or with compoſitions of a practical nature.</p>
            <p>The journey which Dr. Doddridge took to St. Alban's for the purpoſe of preaching Dr. Clark's funeral ſermon, laid the foundation of his own death. In that journey, which, as we have ſeen before, was in December, 1750, he unhappily contracted a cold, that hung upon him during the remainder of the winter. When the ſpring advanced, the diſorder conſiderably abated; but in the ſummer it returned again
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:025154_0244_0FCE74452F9B1688"/>
with great violence. In this ſtate of his health, he was adviſed by his phyſicians and friends to lay aſide his public work for a time, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to the uſe of proper medicines and exerciſe for the removal of his complaint. With the former part of this advice he could not be prevailed upon to comply; for, in his eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be uſeleſs was worſe than death. Whilſt he apprehended that there was no immediate danger, he could not be induced to decline, or even to leſſen, the various ſacred employments in which he ſo much delighted; and he was particularly deſirous to complete the fair tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of his Family Expoſitor. The nearer he approached to his diſſolution, the more plainly was obſerved his continual improvement in a ſpiritual and heavenly temper. Indeed, he ſeemed to have gotten above the world, and to be daily breathing after immortality. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his mind was ardently expreſſed in ſeveral of his letters, and is manifeſt from his will, which was made at this time, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced in the following language:
<q>Whereas it is cuſtomary on theſe occaſions to begin with commending the ſoul into the hands of GOD through Chriſt; I do it, not in mere form, but with ſincerity and joy; eſteeming it my greateſt happineſs, that I am taught and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to do it, by that glorious goſpel, which, having moſt aſſuredly believed, I have ſpent my life in preaching to others; and which I eſteem an infinitely greater treaſure than all my little worldly ſtore, or poſſeſſions ten thouſand times greater than mine.</q>*</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="unknown:025154_0245_0FCE7446E478D290"/>The laſt time that Dr. Doddridge adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord's Supper to his congregation at Northampton, was on the ſecond of June, 1751. In the ſermon which he delivered previouſly to the celebration of the ordinance, and which was from Hebrews xii.23, he expatiated on the illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious and innumerable aſſembly that would meet together in the celeſtial world; and in the concluſion of the whole ſervice, he mentioned, with marks of uncommon pleaſure, the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt over miniſters and churches. He dropped, likewiſe, ſome hints of his approaching deceaſe, and ſpoke with great tenderneſs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his people on the proſpect of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſeparation. After this he ſpent ſome weeks in London, where the hurries and fatigues he went through contributed to increaſe his diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. On his return from the metropolis, which was nearly the middle of July, he determined, notwithſtanding the earneſt entreaties of his friends to the contrary, to addreſs his flock once more from the pulpit. The diſcourſe, which proved in fact to be his farewel ſermon, was from Romans xiv.8, and was well adapted, not only to the ſtate of his congregation, but to that of his pupils, for whoſe future improvement and welfare he was tenderly concerned.</p>
            <p>The laſt public ſervice, in which Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge was ever engaged, was on the eighteenth of July, at the ordination of the Rev. Mr. Adams, at Bewdley, in Worceſterſhire. How unfit he was at this time for taking any part in the duties of the day, was diſplayed in his pale countenance, and in his languid, trembling

voice; but he had promiſed his aſſiſtance, and was unwilling to be abſent or unemployed on the occaſion. From Bewdley he went to Shrewſbury, where he reſided ſeveral weeks, at the houſe of his friend Mr. Orton, for the convenience of air, exerciſe, and an entire receſs from buſineſs and company. By this retirement he ſeemed to be a little recruited. Whilſt he was at Shrewſbury, he received many letters from his friends, expreſſive of their high eſteem and affection for him, and of their deep concern for his dangerous illneſs.* A very pathetic one, written by Mr. Neal, will be found in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection lately publiſhed. Part of what he wrote is as follows:
<q>You may be ſure, we are all greatly affected with the danger that threatens a life ſo univerſally deſirable, and to us ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly endeared: and our invaluable friend <hi>(Mr. Barker)</hi> diſſolved not only us, but great part of his numerous audience, into tears, by a kind of inſpired eloquence, with which he offered up ſtrong pleas and cries, for your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and revival, to him who is able to deliver from death.—My dear friend, I beſeech you not to think of returning to Northampton, even though you ſhould receive all imaginable benefit at Shrewſbury in the enſuing fortnight, till you have viſited Briſtol; and in preparing for that expedition, I conceive no time ſhould be loſt, as the ſeaſon for the waters, as well as of the year, is ſo far advanced. I ſhould tremble for your return to Northampton at preſent, notwithſtanding ſome encouraging

ſymptoms; for a relapſe could hardly fail of being fatal, and in ſuch a circumſtance would be next to certain, conſidering your various engagements, and active temper.</q>
Speaking of the academy, Mr. Neal adds,
<q>Mr. Clark, I am perſuaded, is able to do what is fully ſufficient, and will be very acceptable to the truſtees. And I rejoice in his ability (which I do not at all diſtruſt) to keep the pupils very profitably employed for ſome time; though I ſhould much rather hear the academy was all diſbanded, than that you ſhould read a ſingle lecture between this and Michaelmas. In one word, your whole duty to GOD and man is comprehended in the care of your health.</q>

<q>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham, Neal, and Barker, are too nearly intereſted in that precious life, which now appears in danger of being cut off in the midſt of its days, to hear of its waſte and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without great concern and fervent prayer to GOD.

But now for the wings of faith and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. Let me take thy hand, my dear brother, and walk a turn or two in yonder ſpacious regions. Yes, it is ſo: we read it in the Book of GOD, that word of truth and goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of our ſalvation, that as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. The one ruined his poſterity by ſin; the other raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſeed to immortality.

            <p>Dr. Doddridge was ſo deeply affected with the friendſhip expreſſed in this letter, and the divine conſolations which it adminiſtered, that there was reaſon to be apprehenſive that his tender frame would have ſunk under the emotions of his gratitude and joy.</p>
            <p>In autumn, his phyſicians judged it proper that he ſhould make a trial of the waters of Briſtol; and accordingly he went thither in the month of Auguſt. Upon his arrival at that place, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy clergyman of the eſtabliſhed church, with whom he had only a ſlight acquaintance, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him in the moſt hoſpitable manner and with a fraternal affection, till he could be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odated with ſuitable apartments near the wells; and Dr. Maddox, Biſhop of Worceſter, paid him a friendly viſit, and, in very obliging terms, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to convey him in his chariot, at the ſtated times of drinking the water. Little hope of his deriving benefit from it was given him by the phyſicians at Briſtol; and he received their report of the great hazard of his caſe with a fortitude, reſignation, and cheerfulneſs, which never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him to the laſt, in any place, or on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:025154_0252_0FCE7457E8435F80"/>
Here he met with ſeveral of his friends, who were deſirous to do all in their power to teſtify their regard for him; and offers of ſervice and aſſiſtance were made to him by ſtrangers, and even by perſons who had formerly conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prejudices againſt him. A worthy nobleman intereſted himſelf as kindly about the Doctor's health, as if he had long been his intimate friend. Whilſt Dr. Doddridge was at Briſtol, he was viſited by ſome of the principal people of his congregation, who expreſſed an affection for him not to be deſcribed, and who brought with them aſſurances of the ſame affection from the reſt of his flock, and of their ardent and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prayers for his recovery. This new proof of their regard afforded him great ſatisfaction and refreſhment. He was directed by his phyſicians to ſpeak and write as little as poſſible; but he could not content himſelf without ſometimes ſending letters, in ſhort-hand, to a few choſen friends, expreſſive of the excellent frame of his mind.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 277—281</note>
            </p>
            <p>The health of Dr. Doddridge continuing ſtill more and more to decline, he was adviſed, as the laſt reſort in ſo threatening a diſorder, to remove to a warmer climate for the winter. It was propoſed that he ſhould go to Liſbon. In deliberating upon this ſcheme, his principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it was the great expenſe with which the execution of it would neceſſarily be attended. He doubted whether, with ſo very precarious a hope of its being beneficial to him, he ought to purſue the deſign; when his family, which, in
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:025154_0253_0FCE745BC864CDC0"/>
caſe of his deceaſe, would be but ſlenderly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, would be conſiderably injured by the voyage. "It will," ſays Mr. Orton,
<q>I hope, appear to every conſiderate reader, a glorious circumſtance in the Doctor's life, that it was ſacrificed to the generous, diſintereſted ſervice of his great Maſter, and benevolence to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; that, with the advantage of a genius and qualifications equal to the higheſt advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the eſtabliſhment, and without being chargeable with want of economy, he ſhould find himſelf under the painful neceſſity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the little remainder of his life, by an expenſe diſproportionate to the proviſion made for his family, dear to him as his own life.</q>
There happened to be at Briſtol a clergyman of the church of England, who had not been previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acquainted with Dr. Doddridge, but who behaved to him in the kindeſt and moſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner. In converſation with this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Doctor undeſignedly threw out a hint of the principal reaſon which cauſed him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur about the voyage. The benevolent cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman immediately ſeized the hint, and took an opportunity of expreſſing, before a lady of conſiderable fortune, who was a diſſenter, his eſteem and reſpect for the Doctor, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it gave him, that a perſon who did ſo much honour to chriſtianity in general, and to his own den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>if his conſcience had not prevented, might have been in one of the firſt dignities in their church,</q>

<pb n="256" facs="unknown:025154_0254_0FCE745D44D672F8"/>
from taking a ſtep, on which perhaps his life depended. He added, that, in his opinion, it would be an everlaſting reproach upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters as a body, if thoſe who knew of his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation did not take ſome ſpeedy and vigorous meaſures to remove the difficulty. No ſooner had this gentleman given the hint, and ſet a handſome precedent, than it was cheerfully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; and the generoſity of Dr. Doddridge's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance at Briſtol and in other places, fully equalled his wants and his wiſhes. Mr. Neal was particularly active in the management of the affair, and had the pleaſure of informing the Doctor, that inſtead of ſelling what our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had in the funds, he ſhould be able, through the benevolence of friends, to add ſomething to it, after the expenſe of the voyage was defrayed.</p>
            <p>Whilſt Dr. Doddridge continued at Briſtol, and his journey was in proſpect, many other pleaſing circumſtances occurred, which tended to lighten his affliction. A ſervant, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, of the family where he lodged, offered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to attend him to Liſbon on very reaſonable terms; a propoſal which was the more ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and acceptable, as infirm perſons, who deſigned the ſame voyage, uſually found it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to procure ſuch attendance, even by large offers.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p 281—287</note> Dr. Oliver was at no ſmall pains to prepare every thing for making the journey as comfortable as poſſible; and Mr. Warburton prevailed upon the ſecretary of the Poſt-Office to write to the captain of the packet-boat at Falmouth, to engage him to
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:025154_0255_0FCE745EB13F0288"/>
give Dr. Doddridge the beſt accommodations in his power.<note n="†" place="bottom">Letters, ubi ſupra, p. 264.</note> On the ſeventeenth of September the Doctor left Briſtol, and after a fatiguing journey of ten days, occaſioned partly by the badneſs of the ſeaſon and roads, and partly by his great weakneſs, he arrived at Falmouth. There he was received in the kindeſt manner by Dr. Turner, the phyſician of the place, who gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly entertained him in his houſe, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to the care of his nephew, Dr. Cantley, at Liſbon. During Dr. Doddridge's journey and ſtay at Falmouth; his moſt painful and threatening ſymptoms had been ſuſpended; but, on the night before he ſailed, they returned with greater violence than ever. Mrs. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge, therefore, thought it neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he ſhould either return home, or ſtay a while longer at Falmouth. Having, however, ſome hope from a change of climate, he gave this ſhort anſwer, "The die is caſt, and I chooſe to go."</p>
            <p>The propriety of Dr. Doddridge's voyage to Liſbon has by ſome perſons been doubted; but in this undertaking he acted by the unanimous advice of the moſt competent judges. At Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth much civility was ſhewn him by ſeveral of the inhabitants of the place, to whom his friends had written for that purpoſe, and he parted from them with the utmoſt gratitude and tenderneſs. On Monday the thirtieth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember he went on board the packet; and as the captain of it did not happen to go the voyage, the Doctor had the convenience of his cabin,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:025154_0256_0FCE7460EB8DF6A0"/>
which was no ſmall comfort and advantage to him in his weak condition. Upon the ſailing of the veſſel, the new ſcene which opened upon him, and the ſoft air and freſh breezes of the ſea, had the moſt pleaſing effect on his ſpirits. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">
                  <desc>••••••</desc>
               </gap>neſs was ſeverely felt by Mrs. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge and the ſervant; but happily he himſelf did not ſuffer from it; ſo that he needed their attendance and aſſiſtance leſs than before. He generally ſat, the greateſt part of the day, in an eaſy chair, in the captain's cabin; and his mind was admirably ſuſtained by delightful views of the heavenly world. Such ſacred gratitude and joy appeared in his countenance, as often bro't to the remembrance of his lady the following lines in one of his hymns:
<q>
                  <l>When Death o'er Nature ſhall prevail,</l>
                  <l>And all the powers of language fail,</l>
                  <l>Joy through my ſwimming eyes ſhall break,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>mean</hi> the thanks I cannot ſpeak.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the Bay of Biſcay the veſſel was unhappily becalmed for ſome days; and the weather prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo intenſely hot, that Dr. Doddridge's col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquative ſweats returned, attended with a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that threatened his ſpeedy diſſolution. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, however, ſtill lengthened out the feeble thread of life. When the ſhip came to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired haven, and was waiting for the uſual cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of entrance, the fineneſs of the day, the ſoftneſs of the air, and the delightful proſpects by which he was ſurrounded, gave him a freſh flow of ſtrength and ſpirits. He ſtayed upon
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:025154_0257_0FCE74679643A560"/>
deck about two hours, and derived from it ſuch a ſenſible degree of refreſhment, as to raiſe even a flattering hope of his recovery. On Sunday the thirteenth of October he landed at Liſbon. The next day he wrote to his aſſiſtant at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, giving him a ſhort account of his voyage, of the magnificent appearance which the city made from the ſea, and of what he obſerved in paſſing through the ſtreets. After mentioning his great weakneſs and danger, he added,
<q>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I bleſs GOD, the moſt undiſturbed ſerenity continues in my mind, and my ſtrength holds proportion to my day. I ſtill hope and truſt in GOD, and joyfully acquieſce in all he may do with me. When you ſee my dear friends of the congregation, inform them of my circumſtances, and aſſure them, that I cheerfully ſubmit myſelf to GOD. If I deſire life may be reſtored, it is chiefly that it may be employed in ſerving Chriſt among them; and that I am enabled by faith to look upon death as an enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed; and can cheerfully leave my dear Mrs. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge a widow in a ſtrange land, if ſuch be the appointment of our heavenly Father. I hope I have done my duty, and the Lord do as ſeemeth good in his ſight.</q>

            </p>
            <p>At Liſbon, Dr. Doddridge was kindly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entertained at the houſe of Mr. David King, an Engliſh merchant, whoſe mother was one of the Doctor's congregation, and who had now an opportunity he could never have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but which he gladly embraced, of repaying
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:025154_0258_0FCE74691E8D3E48"/>
the many ſervices that had been done for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations at Northampton. In this worthy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our author found the moſt cordial friendſhip, and every accommodation that could tend to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate his diſorder. Here he happened to meet with Dr. Watts's Treatiſe on the Happineſs of ſeparate Spirits, which, being a work entirely coincident with his own ſentiments, delighted him in a peculiar manner. In reading this book, Dr. Watts's Hymns, and eſpecially the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he employed as much time as his ſtrength would admit. At Liſbon he found a family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to Mrs. Doddridge, as well as other kind friends, who, either from a knowledge of his character, or from having received voluntary let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of recommendation, ſhewed him all the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility in their power, and indeed ſeemed to ſtrive who ſhould moſt excel in diſplaying for him an aſſiduous and tender regard. From their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he derived pleaſure, though it was attended with the painful circumſtance of his not being able to converſe with them as freely as he could have wiſhed to have done. The Rev. Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamſon in particular, then chaplain to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh factory, frequently viſited him, with the temper and behaviour of the gentleman, the chriſtian, and the divine.</p>
            <p>About a week after Dr. Doddridge's arrival, by the advice of his phyſician, Dr. Cantley, who attended him without receiving the uſual fees, he was removed into the country, a few miles from Liſbon. This, however, was productive of no advantage; for the rainy ſeaſon, which in that climate uſually ſets in about the latter end
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:025154_0259_0FCE7469EC70C138"/>
of October, came on with ſuch uncommon vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as not only to preclude any aſſiſtance from air and exerciſe, but to add greatly to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. On the twenty-fourth of October he was ſeized with a colliquative diarrhoea, which ſoon exhauſted his little ſtrength. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, during the ſucceeding night, which ſeemed the laſt of rational life, he preſerved the ſame calmneſs, vigour, and joy of mind, which he had felt and expreſſed through the whole of his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The only pain he had in the thought of dying, was the fear of that grief and diſtreſs which Mrs. Doddridge would ſuffer from his removal. To his children, his congregation, and his friends in general, he deſired to be remembered in the moſt affectionate manner; nor did he forget the family where he lodged, or his own ſervant, in the effuſions of his pious benevolence. Many devout ſentiments and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations were uttered by him; but Mrs. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's heart was too much affected with his approaching change, to be able to recollect them diſtinctly. On the following day he lay in a gentle doſe, in which be continued till an hour before his death. At the laſt ſtruggle he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſtleſs, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ched ſeveral deep ſighs, ſoon after which he obtained his releaſe. This event took place on Saturday the twenty-ſixth of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, old ſtile, about three o'clock in the morning: and though he died in a foreign land, and in a certain ſenſe among ſtrangers, his deceaſe was embalmed with many tears. Not only the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal gentlemen of the factory, but even their ſervants, manifeſted a high ſenſe of Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:025154_0260_0FCE746B6F8BDC18"/>
worth, and of the greatneſs of the public loſs. A circumſtance which afforded much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Mrs. Doddridge, and her Liſbon friends, was, that the Doctor, in his laſt ſcenes, was not moleſted by the officious zeal of any of the prieſts of the church of Rome. Agreeably to the deſire which he had expreſſed before his death, his body was opened, when his lungs were found in ſo ulcerated a ſtate, that it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſurpriſing to the phyſician that his ſpeaking and breathing had not been far more difficult and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him than in fact they were, even to the laſt.</p>
            <p>Dr. Doddridge had frequently expreſſed a wiſh of being buried at his meeting place at Northampton, where his children and ſo many of his congregation and friends were depoſited. However, during his illneſs, he ſpoke of this as a matter quite indifferent to him; and, to avoid increaſing the diſtreſs of his afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, was deſirous of being interred wherever he ſhould die. It was found, upon enquiry, that the removal of the body to England would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a very large expenſe, and therefore it was judged moſt prudent to decline it. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his remains were conveyed to the burying-ground belonging to the Britiſh factory at Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, with as much decency and reſpect as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and the place would admit. The greater part of the gentlemen of the factory at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his funeral; and Mr. Williamſon, on the following Sunday, preached a ſermon, in which he gave him a high and honourable character, founded on what he had heard from many, of his worth, and on what he had himſelf ſeen, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Though Dr. Doddridge's congregation had not the melancholy ſatisfaction of having him interred at his own meeting-houſe, they erected in it a handſome monument to his memory, and made a generous preſent to his widow after her return. The inſcription, which was drawn up by the Doctor's much eſteemed and ingenious friend, Gilbert Weſt, Eſq. was as follows:

She had accompanied her huſband to a foreign land, and had been witneſs to the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful event of his death. Through the goodneſs of GOD ſhe was enabled to preſerve fortitude and ſerenity in the midſt of her deep affliction. What the ſtate of her mind was, is finely repreſented in a letter which ſhe wrote to her children from Liſbon, a few days after the Doctor's deceaſe, and which has lately been printed, for the firſt time, in the Gentleman's Magazine.

                        </opener>
                        <p>How ſhall I addreſs you under this awful and melancholy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence! I would fain ſay ſomething to comfort you. And I hope GOD will enable me to ſay ſomething that may alleviate your deep diſtreſs. I went out in a firm dependence that, if Infinite Wiſdom was pleaſed to call me out to duties and trials as yet unknown, he would grant me thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior aids of ſtrength that would ſupport and keep me from fainting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; perſuaded that there was no diſtreſs or ſorrow, into which he could lead me, under which his gracious and all-ſufficient arm could not ſupport me. He has not diſappointed me, nor ſuffered the heart and eyes directed to him to fail. "GOD all-ſufficient, and my only hope," is my motto: let it be yours. Such, indeed, have I found him; and ſuch, I verily believe, you will find him too in this time of deep diſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>Oh! my dear children, help me to praiſe him! Such ſupports, ſuch conſolations, ſuch comforts, has he granted to the meaneſt of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that my mind, at times, is held in perfect aſtoniſhment, and is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to burſt into ſongs of praiſe under its moſt exquiſite diſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>As to outward comforts, GOD has withheld no good thing from me, but has given me all the aſſiſtance, and all the ſupports, that the tendereſt friendſhip was capable of affording me, and which I think my dear North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton friends could not have exceeded. Their prayers are not loſt. I doubt not but I am reaping the benefit of them, and hope that you will do the ſame.</p>
                        <p>I am returned to good Mr. King's. Be good to poor Mrs. King. It is a debt of gratitude I owe for the great obligations I am under to that worthy family here. Such a ſolicitude of friendſhip was ſurely hardly ever known as I meet with here. I have the offers of friendſhip more than I can employ; and it gives a real concern to many here that they cannot find out a way to ſerve me. Theſe are great honours conferred on the dear deceaſed, and great comforts to me. It is impoſſible to ſay how much theſe mercies are endeared to me, as coming in ſuch an immediate manner from the Divine Hand. To his name be the praiſe and glory of all!</p>
                        <p>And now, my dear children, what ſhall I ſay to you? Ours is no common loſs. I mourn the beſt of huſbands and of friends, removed from this world of ſin and ſorrow to the regions of immortal bliſs and light. What a glory! What a mercy is it that I am enabled with my thoughts to purſue him there! You have loſt the deareſt and beſt of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the guide of your youth! and whoſe pleaſure it would have been to have introduced you into life with great advantages.</p>
                        <p>Our loſs is great indeed! But I really think the loſs the public has ſuſtained is ſtill greater. But GOD can never want inſtruments to carry on his work. Yet, let us be thankful that GOD ever gave us ſuch a friend; that he has continued him ſo long with us. Perhaps, if we had been to have judged, we ſhould have thought that we nor the world could never leſs have ſpared him than at the preſent time. But I ſee the hand of Heaven, the appointment of his wiſe Providence, in every ſtep of this aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpenſation. It is his hand that has put the bitter cup into ours. And what does he now expect from us but a meek, humble, entire ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his will? We know this is our duty. Let us pray for thoſe aids of his Spirit, which can only enable us to attain it. A father of the fatherleſs is GOD in his holy habitation. As ſuch may your eyes be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to him! He will ſupport you. He will comfort you. And that he may, is not only my daily, but hourly prayer.</p>
                        <p>We have never deſerved ſo great a good as that we have loſt. And let us remember, that the beſt reſpect we can pay to his memory is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as far as we can, to follow his example, to cultivate thoſe amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities that rendered him ſo juſtly dear to us, and ſo greatly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the world. Particularly I would recommend this to my dear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>. May I have the joy to ſee him acting the part worthy the relation to ſo amiable and excellent a parent, whoſe memory, I hope, will ever be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſacred to him and to us all! Under GOD, may he be a comfort to me, and a ſupport to the family! Much depends on him. His leſs I think peculiarly great. But I know an all-ſufficient GOD can overrule it as the means of the greateſt good to him.</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible for me to tell you how tenderly my heart feels for you all! how much I long to be with you to comfort and aſſiſt you. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, you are the only inducements I now have left to wiſh for life, that I may do what little is in my power to form and guide your tender years.

In her voyage homeward, and
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:025154_0263_0FCE74722A8F5320"/>
upon her return to her family, ſhe was ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and ſupported beyond what could have been expected. By the circumſtance of Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:025154_0264_0FCE7473CD3CE698"/>
dying abroad ſhe loſt a conſiderable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, which he had provided for her in caſe of widowhood, and to which ſhe would otherwiſe have been entitled. To this conſequence of his voyage, ſhould he die abroad, the Doctor was totally a ſtranger; and it was happy for him that he was never acquainted with it, ſince it muſt have lien with weight upon his ſpirits. The generoſity of his friends was active to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the loſs which Mrs. Doddridge had ſuſtained. A ſubſcription was opened for her, chiefly in London, and, in a great meaſure, under the direction of Mr. Neal, whoſe kind offices to Dr. Doddridge's family were eminent and invariable. In a ſhort time a ſum was raiſed, which was more than equal to the forfeiture of the annuity. Beſides this, Mrs. Doddridge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral other handſome preſents, which were ſent her as ſubſcriptions to the Family Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor, from perſons of rank, both among the clergy and laity of the eſtabliſhed church. The manner in which theſe benefactions were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated heightened their value. They were
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:025154_0265_0FCE747832E5DC88"/>
beſtowed with ſo much delicacy, and reflected ſuch high honour on Dr. Doddridge's memory, that ſhe retained a deep impreſſion of them to the lateſt hour of her life. Another inſtance of regard that was paid her, was, that the diſſenting miniſters in the neighbourhood of Northampton, and the pupils who had begun to preach, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Doctor's congregation, during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and for half a year after his deceaſe, that the ſalary might be continued to his family for that time.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 299, 300.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Doddridge's funeral ſermon was preached by Mr. Orton, who was in every view the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt perſon for that ſervice. On what day it was delivered does not appear from the copy now lying before me. The text was, 1 Cor. xv.54, and the words, "Death is ſwallowed up in victory." In a ſhort time the diſcourſe was publiſhed, and had an extenſive circulation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of "The Chriſtian's Triumph over Death." It has ſince been annexed to the three volumes of the Doctor's Sermons and religious Tracts. Mr. Orton did not enter largely into the character of his revered and beloved friend, having probably then formed the deſign of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his life.</p>
            <p>The muſes were not ſilent on Dr. Doddridge's deceaſe. A poem to his memory was publiſhed by a young gentleman, who, at the time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it, was a pupil at his academy. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was Mr. Henry More, who afterwards ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in Devonſhire, of which county he is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and who is now a diſſenting miniſter at
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:025154_0266_0FCE747ABB215828"/>
Leſkard in Cornwall. By his friends he is known not only to be an ingenious poet, but a ſound ſcholar, eſpecially in Biblical criticiſm. The following lines will afford an agreeable ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of the merit of the poem.</p>

            <p>Dr. Doddridge was not handſome in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. In ſtature he was ſomewhat above the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſize, with a ſtoop in his ſhoulders, and he was very thin and ſlender. But when he was engaged in converſation, or employed in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, there was a remarkable ſprightlineſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity in his countenance and manner, which commanded a general attention.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid p. 301.</note> Mrs. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge ſurvived her huſband nearly forty years, all which time ſhe exhibited an eminent pattern of the Chriſtian virtues. She departed this life at Tewkeſbury, in Gloceſterſhire, where ſhe had long reſided. The Doctor left four children, one ſon, and three daughters. Philip, the ſon, was brought up to the law, and ſettled as an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney at Tewkeſbury, where he died ſeveral years ago. The eldeſt daughter married Mr. Humphreys, an attorney of the ſame place. She and her two ſiſters, who are ſingle, are ſtill liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>It was a happy circumſtance, that, at the time of Dr. Doddridge's illneſs and deceaſe, he had for his aſſiſtant in the Academy Mr. Samuel Clark, the ſon of his friend Dr. Clark. In this gentleman were united wiſdom, knowledge, and an uncommon equanimity and ſteadineſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Indeed, though very young, he was well qualified to have been choſen to ſucceed Dr.
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:025154_0268_0FCE747D829A1B70"/>
Doddridge in the office of principal tutor: but this his modeſty would not have permitted; and, upon the whole, it was undoubtedly proper that a man of more advanced life ſhould be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The perſon elected by Mr. Coward's truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, and who had been recommended by Dr. Doddridge in his will, was the Rev. Mr. (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Dr.) Caleb Aſhworth, of Daventry, to which place the academy was removed in the autumn of 1752. Dr. Aſhworth diſcharged the duties of the truſt with great fidelity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and with an ability that increaſed as he proceeded in his employment. Mr. Clark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as his aſſiſtant for ſeveral years, and, in ſo doing, contributed, in no ſmall degree, to the uſefulneſs and ſucceſs of the inſtitution. Whilſt he was at Daventry he preached and publiſhed a ſermon on occaſion of the earthquake at Liſbon. He afterwards ſettled at the Old Meeting at Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham, where he was highly and juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and eſteemed, not only by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but by all who knew him. On Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the third of December, 1769, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily killed, in the prime of his days, by a fall from his horſe, as he was ſetting out to preach in the neighbourhood.

<pb n="271" facs="unknown:025154_0269_0FCE7481F6955BB0"/>
to make their appearance. Happily he had fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed the whole of the copy, in ſhort hand, a few ſlight notes towards the concluſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and the larger part had been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for the preſs. This was the caſe with all the fourth volume, the preface to which had been written by our author. In 1754 that volume was publiſhed, containing St. Paul's Epiſtle to the Romans, and his firſt and ſecond Epiſtles to the Corinthians.
<q>As far as I know myſelf,</q>
ſays the Doctor,
<q>I have no favourite hypotheſis to ſerve, nor a fondneſs for any unſcriptural phraſes; in which ſo many have, on one ſide, and the other, made the very being of orthodoxy to conſiſt. I have been diſpoſed to let ſcripture carry me along with it, wherever it naturally leads, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than reſolve it ſhould follow me. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of labouring to eſtabliſh any human ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, which has always, I fear, a leaven of imperfection attending it; I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to keep controverſy as much out of ſight as poſſible, and to repreſent what I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe to be the Scripture doctrine, in as ſimple a manner as I could, and diveſted of thoſe particular expreſſions, which ſome, who perhaps are not averſe to the main doctrine it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, are ready to riſe up againſt.</q>
One rule of interpretation laid down by Dr. Doddridge was, when the text and context will bear two meanings, to prefer that which gives the nobleſt and moſt extenſive ſenſe, and might make the paſſage in queſtion moſt univerſally uſeful. Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, however, as this rule may appear, there is
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:025154_0270_0FCE748697C78640"/>
danger, unleſs it be exerciſed with peculiar judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of its being occaſionally productive of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. In fact, the buſineſs of a commentator on ſcripture is to find out the ſingle original ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the language uſed by the ſacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and not to indulge his imagination in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſcope to words beyond what was at firſt ſpecifically intended.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the year 1755, Mr. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton publiſhed a Collection of Dr. Doddridge's hymns. Few of the Doctor's works have been more generally acceptable, the ſixth edition of them having appeared in 1788. Indeed, they are, upon the whole, well calculated to anſwer the purpoſes of chriſtian devotion; and, being all of them founded upon particular texts of ſcripture, cannot fail of being uſeful to miniſters who preach on the ſame texts. With reſpect to poetical merit, if they cannot be placed in a high rank, they have enough of it for the immediate view which they were intended to anſwer. As the author had not ſo good an ear as Dr. Watts, his numbers are not equally flowing and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious. It may be mentioned to his praiſe, that he has not indulged to the extravagancies which Dr. Watts has fallen into, eſpecially in the firſt book of his hymns. I obſerve with pleaſure, that Dr. Doddridge has not taken a ſingle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from the Canticles.</p>
            <p>The two remaining volumes of the Family Expoſitor, being the fifth and ſixth, were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Mr. Orton in 1756. From the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's advertiſement it appears, that Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge had himſelf tranſcribed for the preſs the
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:025154_0271_0FCE7487F4138B00"/>
paraphraſe, improvements, and notes, of the fourth and fifth volumes, and the paraphraſe and improvements of the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, and the two firſt Epiſtles of St. John. The notes on theſe three Epiſtles, together with the paraphraſe, improvements, and notes, on the remaining Epiſtles and the "Revelation," were carefully tranſcribed either by Mr. Orton him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or by ſome of the Doctor's pupils, and the tranſcript was compared ſeveral times with the ſhort-hand copy. An accident which, during the author's life, happened to part of the original manuſcript, deſerves to be recorded. In June, 1750, a fire broke out in his ſtudy, occaſioned by a wax candle's being left on his writing deſk, and conſumed many of his papers, and, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, part of one volume of the ſhort-hand copy of the Family Expoſitor. The light of the fire being, however, providentially diſcovered by an oppoſite neighbour, who gave an immediate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, it was ſpeedily extinguiſhed. When the Doctor was informed of the accident, he ſeemed moſt anxious about the preſervation of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript; and when the flames were quenched, it appeared, to his great joy and ſurpriſe, that only that part of the volume which had been tranſcribed was deſtroyed; that the tranſcript lay in another place out of danger; and that all the untranſcribed pages were perfectly legible, the edges of them only being ſinged.
<q>Being an eye-witneſs,</q>
ſays Mr. Orton,
<q>of the danger and deliverance, I record this account of it,—chiefly as it ſeems to denote a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of Providence in preſerving this work,
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:025154_0272_0FCE748A48878090"/>
and a favourable omen that GOD intends it for extenſive and laſting uſefulneſs.</q>
Thoſe who may not carry their reflections ſo far as Mr. Orton has done, will ſympathize with Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge in the pleaſure which he received in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his manuſcript preſerved.</p>
            <p>Of all our author's writings, the Family Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor is the moſt important and valuable. It is the work in which he took the greateſt pains, and on which his literary reputation principally depends. Many of his notes diſplay a ſagacious and judicious ſpirit of criticiſm, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reflections are of general utility. How well the work has been received by the learned and pious world, is apparent from the continued de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it down to the preſent time; nor is its popularity likely to decreaſe. It is the ſeventh edition which is now called for by the public; not to mention the ſeparate impreſſions of it that have appeared in Scotland and Ireland. In paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a juſt encomium on the Family Expoſitor, it will not be underſtood that there is any deſign of aſſerting that it is a performance which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally exempt from imperfections and errors. Such is not the character of the beſt human productions. Diverſities of ſentiment will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with regard to Dr. Doddridge's interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of particular paſſages, and his criticiſms upon them. Perhaps likewiſe, in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his paraphraſes may be deemed rather too redundant. But no obſervations of this kind are inconſiſtent with allowing to the work the praiſe of its contributing, in a high degree, to chriſtian inſtruction and improvement. The
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:025154_0273_0FCE748FACB5C918"/>
proper inference to be drawn from any miſtakes into which the moſt ſucceſsful illucidations of the ſcriptures have fallen, is, not to depreciate their general merit, but to avoid placing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due confidence on their authority. While we thankfully derive from them the aſſiſtance they are capable of affording us in our enquiries into the meaning of the ſacred oracles, we ſhould freely examine, and impartially judge for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Dr. Doddridge thought it would contribute to the uſefulneſs of his expoſition, to digeſt the hiſtory of the four Evangeliſts into one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeries, or, in other words, to throw it into the order of an harmony. If ſuch an harmony could be effectually and deciſively aſcertained, each ſtory and diſcourſe would be exhibited with all its concurrent circumſtances, as recorded by the ſacred penmen; frequent repetitions would be prevented; and a multitude of ſeeming oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions be ſo evidently reconciled as to ſuperſede many objections. Theſe undoubtedly are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable objects, and the attainment of them is worthy of being ſought for. We are indebted to the exertions of thoſe gentlemen who have laboured in this field of theological literature. Where they have not ſufficiently ſucceeded in the main point, they have, by their reſearches, been enabled to throw a new and beautiful light on many paſſages of the evangelical hiſtorians. That there is no ſmall difficulty in the general ſubject, is manifeſt from the various ſyſtems that have been formed upon it by the ableſt ſcholars, and the moſt judicious critics.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="unknown:025154_0274_0FCE7491D6140DC8"/>One part of Dr. Doddridge's Family Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which muſt have coſt him uncommon pains, was his having every where interwoven the text with the paraphraſe, and carefully diſtinguiſhed the former from the latter by the italic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. By this method it is impoſſible to read the paraphraſe without the text; and every one may immediately ſee, not only the particular clauſe to which any explication anſwers, but alſo what are the words of the original, and what merely the ſenſe of the commentator. Nor was our author content with barely inſerting the old tranſlation, but gave an entire new verſion of the whole Teſtament, the merit and uſefulneſs of which will in many reſpects be acknowledged. This tranſlation was extracted from the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, and publiſhed in 1765, in two volumes, 12mo. with ſome alterations and improvements by the editor, together with an introduction, and a number of very ſhort notes.</p>
            <p>The laſt work of Dr. Doddridge which was given to the public, was his
<q>Courſe of Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on the principal Subjects of Pneumatol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy, Ethics, and Divinity; with References to the moſt conſiderable Authors on each Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</q>
Of the nature and value of theſe lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which appeared in 1763, in one volume, quarto, I have already ſpoken. As another edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may probably ſoon be demanded, it may not be amiſs to ſuggeſt, that it would be extremely uſeful to enlarge the liſt of references, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the names and productions of thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who have treated upon the ſeveral matters in queſtion ſince the Doctor's deceaſe. To a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:025154_0275_0FCE7493594AD698"/>
converſant in the hiſtory of controverſies this would be no very difficult taſk; and it might, in particular, eaſily be executed by any gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who, as a tutor, has made uſe of the lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as a text-book, and who conſequently has been in the habit of referring to ſucceeding au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
            <p>If Providence had continued Dr. Doddridge's life, he would undoubtedly have endeavoured to extend his uſefulneſs by many other publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He intended to print a ſermon to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſome ſacramental meditations. A conſiderable progreſs had been made by him in a "Diſſertation on the Jewiſh Proſelytes," the deſign of which was to defend that opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, which he mentions in ſome of his notes upon the Acts of the Apoſtles. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other work, which he had nearly completed, and in which he diſplayed his critical knowledge of the Hebrew language, was a new Tranſlation of the minor Prophets. Neither the Diſſertation on the Jewiſh Proſelytes, nor the Tranſlation of the minor Prophets, were thought to be left in a ſufficient ſtate of perfection to be given to the world.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 107, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Upon Dr. Doddridge's works in general it would be eaſy to produce a variety of encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums. The applauſes he received were nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and what added to their value was, that they came from men by whom it was an honour
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:025154_0276_0FCE7494A984CCA8"/>
to be applauded. Nor was it by the learned among the diſſenters only that his abilities and writings were held in high eſtimation, but by many illuſtrious ornaments of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. This is abundantly apparent from the collection of letters lately publiſhed. There will be found, together with the praiſes of a Barker, a Miles, a Neal, a Leland, and a Lard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thoſe of a Coſtard, a Warburton, an Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a Newton, a Secker, an Ayſcough, a Grey, a Hunt, a Gilbert Weſt, a Maddox, a Sherlock, a Hildeſley, a Ducheſs of Somerſet, and a Lord Lyttelton. "I have read," ſays Biſhop Secker,
<q>your woks with great ſatisfaction, and, I hope, ſome benefit; and both rejoice and wonder that, in the midſt of your other occupations, you continue able, as I pray GOD you long may, to oblige your fellow chriſtians ſo often and ſo highly from the preſs. Indeed it muſt and ought to be owned in general, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters have done excellently of late years in the ſervice of chriſtianity; and I hope our common welfare will make us chiefly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to our common intereſt, and unite us in a cloſer alliance.</q>
By the way, the Biſhop, in the ſame letter, has gently and properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked Dr. Doddridge for the extravagantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimental ſtrain of his epiſtles.
<q>I return you many thanks for your favourable opinion both of my ſermon and its author, though expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a manner which you would have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, if you had known me better.

he doth not deſerve; and ought not to hear if he did. Let us all endeavour to do what good we can; and give thoſe who ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it faithfully, the comfort of knowing we think they do; but never tempt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to forget we are unprofitable ſervants.</q>

            <p>The reception which Dr. Doddridge's writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings met with abroad deſerves to be ſpecifically noticed. It appears that the moſt conſiderable of them have been tranſlated into foreign lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. His Sermons on Regeneration, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Grace, on the Power and Grace of Chriſt, and his Letter on Family Prayer, have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Dutch tongue. The Memoirs of Colonel Gardiner have appeared in the Dutch, French, and German languages; and the Riſe and Progreſs of Religion in the ſame languages, to which may be added the Daniſh. It is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the tranſlation of the laſt work into French was undertaken by the particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the late Prince and Princeſs of Orange, and a number of the gentry in Holland. A Proteſtant Prince of the empire promiſed to recommend it to thoſe about him; and it was ſubſcribed for by many perſons of quality and rich citizens in Germany and Switzerland. Some learned men undertook to tranſlate the former volumes of the Family Expoſitor into German; but the publication of it was oppoſed by ſeveral of the Lutheran clergy, from an apprehenſion that Dr. Doddridge's interpretation of particular paſſages, and his reflections upon them, might not agree with their eſtabliſhed principles, or
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:025154_0278_0FCE749B732746A0"/>
form of church government. To remove their terrors, the perſons concerned in the tranſlation firſt publiſhed the Sermons on Regeneration in that language; the candour and moderation of which had ſuch an effect in quieting the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the other work was completed.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 123— 124.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the eſtimation in which Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge's writings have been held, and continue to be held, both at home and abroad. It does not, however, hence follow, that his moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere admirers will think themſelves obliged to concur with him in every ſentiment and every expreſſion. Many judicious perſons have wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his devotional treatiſes had been more accommodated to univerſal uſe, by a leſs Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical turn of opinion and language.
<q>I reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it one unhappineſs,</q>
ſays Mr. Jones of Welwyn,
<q>of this excellent man (my much reſpected friend) that, having early imbibed the notions of ſome particular ſyſtems, he could not diſlodge them out of his mind in his age of riper judgment. This hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by others.</q>
Mr. Jones adds, that the Doctor's parts were uncommon, his learning great, his moderation equally ſo, and his life and conduct truly chriſtian.<note n="†" place="bottom">Gentleman's Magazine, vol. liii. p. 103.</note> Upon the whole, whatever diverſity of judgment may be formed on different points, the grand end which Dr. Doddridge had in view, and the generally uſeful tendency of his works, cannot be denied. In every thing which he wrote, his aim was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the great purpoſes of practical religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="unknown:025154_0279_0FCE749D32456668"/>The narrative which has now been given of Dr. Doddridge's life, has diſplayed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal circumſtances that illuſtrate his temper and conduct. Nevertheleſs, I cannot diſmiſs the ſubject without entering into a general view of his character. This I am induced to do, partly as it will afford me an opportunity of mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome things not hitherto noticed, and partly becauſe I have the felicity, in the preſent caſe, of writing from an intimate perſonal knowledge; which is a ſatisfaction that has not frequently occurred in the numerous lives I have had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to lay before the public. The view which I ſhall take of our author will be of his intellectual, and of his religious and moral qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities.</p>
            <p>I do not know that genius can be aſcribed to Dr. Doddridge, taking that word in its higheſt ſignification, as employing either a great inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty in ſcience, or that boldneſs of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination which is productive of original imagery and combinations. In a lower and more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſenſe of the term, he might be ſaid to have been a man of genius; for he had a quick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and a lively fancy. He had a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of mind that enabled him to proceed with celerity and vigour in the acquiſition of knowledge; and that activity of his mental frame, which put it into his power to learn much in a little time, was happily accompanied with an invincible reſolution and perſeverance in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſecution of his ſtudies. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his uncommon application, he might even with moderate abilities have laid up a large
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:025154_0280_0FCE38343B023768"/>
ſtock of various learning; and therefore it is not ſurpriſing that this ſhould be the caſe with him, when it is conſidered that he was endued with a quickneſs of apprehenſion, and a remarkable ſtrength of memory. So extenſive was his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with books, that there were few on the general ſubjects of literature which he had not peruſed with attention; and he could retain and eaſily recollect what in them was moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be remembered. Of ancient knowledge he had a conſiderable ſtore. With regard to the learned languages, if he could not be called a profound linguiſt, he was ſufficiently verſed in them to read the moſt valuable pieces of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with taſte and pleaſure. This is apparent from his paraphraſe and notes on the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which he has frequently illuſtrated the force and beauty of the originals with great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the true ſpirit of criticiſm.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 105—10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Dr. Doddridge was well acquainted with the Greek philoſophers and orators, among the laſt of whom he was particularly devoted to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes. To the poets of Greece he was far from being a ſtranger; but he was not, I think, deeply converſant with its tragedians. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, while I reſided with him, his having read Pindar with much admiration. With the Latin claſſics he was largely acquainted. As became a divine and a theological tutor, he diligently ſtudied the ancient fathers, eſpecially of the three firſt centuries. He paid particular regard to the apologiſts for chriſtianity, and was a great maſter of Origen and Euſebius. Beyond the fourth
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:025154_0281_0FCE749FE7A3B868"/>
century his knowledge of this ſpecies of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not, I believe, widely extend, though it did not wholly ſtop there. With eccleſiaſtical hiſtory he had a large acquaintance, and civil hiſtory engaged no ſmall degree of his attention. To this he applied not only to enrich his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with facts, but to make ſuch reflections upon them, as tended either to promote his inſight into human nature, to exemplify the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence, or to explain and illuſtrate the ſacred writings.</p>
            <p>Though Dr. Doddridge's diſpoſition rather led him to cultivate the more polite than the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſer parts of ſcience, he was far from being a ſtranger to mathematical and philoſophical ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. The ſyſtem of Algebra which he read to his pupils was of his own compoſition. But the favourite object of his application, and that in which his principal excellency lay, was divinity, taking that word in its largeſt ſenſe. Whatever could tend to ſtrengthen the proofs of natural or revealed religion, to aſſiſt our conceptions of the divine Nature, or enable us more perfectly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the doctrines and diſcoveries of ſcripture, he thought deſerving of the moſt attentive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. To the evidences of the Jewiſh and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian revelation he had paid uncommon attention, and how complete a maſter he was of the ſubject is apparent from his lectures. Perhaps there were few men who had more carefully ſtudied the different ſyſtems of theology, or who could point out their ſeveral defects with greater accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and judgment. While he was not one of thoſe who affect to treat with contempt the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:025154_0282_0FCE74A3A4936F10"/>
of the wiſe and the learned who have gone before them, but was always ready to receive whatever light they could afford him, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, without a ſlaviſh regard to human ſchemes, he took the ſacred oracles for his guide, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways referred to them for the proofs of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal ſentiments which he maintained. Upon the whole, I entirely agree with Mr. Orton, that, though others might exceed him in their acquaintance with antiquity, or their ſkill in the languages, he was ſurpaſſed by few in the extent of his learning, and in the variety of uſeful and important knowledge of which he was poſſeſſed.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p 107—110.</note>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe ſtores of information, it was a great advantage to Dr. Doddridge that he had an uncommon facility of ſpeaking and of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He uſed to deſcant, in his lectures, on the ſubjects treated of, with ſurpriſing perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity and freedom; and the ſame perſpicuity and freedom attended him when he took the pen in hand. This was owing to the orderly diſpoſition in which things lay in his mind. As his own ideas on the points he had ſtudied, were clear and diſtinct, ſo his method of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging his thoughts was uncommonly juſt and natural. There are, perhaps, few diſcourſes in our language which excel thoſe which were uſually delivered by our author, either in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy of the diviſions, or the adaptation of the ſentiments to the ſubject diſcuſſed. According to the faſhion that now prevails, he may poſſibly be thought to have ſometimes laid down and recapitulated his ſcheme in too formal a manner.

But if he rather exceeded in this reſpect, his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had the advantage of aſſiſting the memory, and contributing to the inſtruction of his hearers and readers.</p>
            <p>Though Dr. Doddridge's invincible perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſtudy has already been mentioned, I am deſirous of enlarging a little farther upon it. Literary diligence is a matter which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways earneſtly wiſhed to preſs on every young man of liberal education with whom I have had acquaintance. When accompanied with original genius, it is the parent of all that is great and valuable in ſcience; and where there is not much of original genius, provided there be a tolerable capacity, it is endued with the power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing valuable attainments, and of rendering eminent ſervices to the learned world. Of this diligence Dr. Doddridge was a ſtriking example. The ſmalleſt portions of time were precious to him; and he was eager to ſeize every moment, even while he was waiting for dinner, company, or his pupils aſſembling together, that he might make ſome advance in any work in which he was engaged. So ſolicitous was he for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al improvement, that one of his ſtudents gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally read to him when he was ſhaving and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. This was a benefit to the pupils, as he took occaſion to inſtruct them, by remarking on their manner of reading, and pointing out the excellencies and defects, either in ſentiment or language, of the book before them. When he was upon a journey, or on occaſional viſits to his friends, where he ſpent the night, he took his papers with him, and employed at leaſt part of
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:025154_0284_0FCE74A6A90FEAC8"/>
the morning in carrying on ſome one or other of his important deſigns. From the time that he began to write his Family Expoſitor, ſomething was done every day in it towards preparing it for the preſs. To all this it may be added, that his employments as an author and a tutor, never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed his moſt abundant labours as a miniſter and a paſtor.</p>
            <p>But what places Dr. Doddridge's diligence in a ſtill more conſpicuous point of view, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his correſpondence. This alone would have been almoſt ſufficient to have employed the whole time of an ordinary perſon. Beſides his correſpondence with the parents and guardians of his pupils, he had a number of letters to write, in anſwer to queſtions of moment which were propoſed to him by his brethren, and eſpecially by thoſe who had ſtudied under him. Theſe laſt naturally applied to him for advice and direction, under the various difficulties which occurred to them in their reſpective ſituations. Many were the congregations that had recourſe to him for miniſters, or upon other accounts. His judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, likewiſe, was frequently deſired by learned men, concerning critical queſtions, or works which they were preparing for the preſs; and his own publications gave occaſion for enquiries of this nature. Several foreign gentlemen and divines, who had heard of his character, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed his writings, ſought his epiſtolary acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and to correſpond with them in Latin or French, was an object that demanded particular attention. It is, indeed, ſurpriſing to find how many hundred letters were received and anſwer-</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="unknown:025154_0285_0FCE74A85F59B220"/>A very honourable part of Dr. Doddridge's correſpondence was that which he maintained with ſome of the brighteſt ornaments, both among the clergy and laity of the eſtabliſhed church. This is apparent from the Collection of Letters lately publiſhed. We there ſee how much he was eſteemed, and how highly he was thought of, by the firſt religious and literary characters of the age. In the collection referred to, the letters of Warburton make a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed figure, and ſhew that great man in a new and very amiable light. They diſplay not only his learning, but the piety, benevolence, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mind. The ſeverity, or rather the arrogance, with which he treated his literary an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts muſt undoubtedly have afforded too juſt cauſe for leaving an unfavourable impreſſion of him in the eſtimation of the world. But in private life he appears in a far more agreeable point of view. The only time I had ever the honour of being in his company, which was an hour and a half in his own ſtudy, I found him remarkably condeſcending in his manner, and admirably inſtructive and entertaining in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
            <p>Dr. Doddridge's correſpondence was, I think, in ſome inſtances carried to an extent that might have been ſpared; and it is now certain that his friend Mr. Neal was ſo far of the ſame opinion, as to give him a gentle rebuke upon the ſubject.* There were people, whoſe good intentions were ſuperior to their wiſdom, and who had very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle valuable to communicate, that were proud of
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:025154_0286_0FCE74A9E6EFAE90"/>
writing letters to him, and of receiving his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; and ſuch was the eaſineſs of his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he was more profuſe in his returns to their kind affections, than convenience or even a regard to his health would admit. Sometimes he lightened his burden, by making uſe of the pen of his pupils, to whom he dictated his letters, while he himſelf went on with his Family Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor, or any other work in which he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. I was not unfrequently either his aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenſis on theſe occaſions, or read to him while he anſwered his correſpondents.</p>
            <p>I am next to take a ſurvey of Dr. Doddridge in his religious and moral character. And here the prime and leading feature of his ſoul was that of devotion. This was the pervading prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his actions, whether private or public. What Dr. Johnſon has obſerved with regard to Dr. Watts, that as piety predominated in his mind, it was diffuſed over his works; and that whatever he took in hand was, by his inceſſant ſolicitude for ſouls, converted to theology,* may with equal propriety be applied to Dr. Doddridge. The greateſt pains were taken by him to keep up an habitual ſenſe of the Supreme Being; to maintain and increaſe the ardour of religion in his heart; and to furniſh himſelf, by devout ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, for the important labours of his ſtation. Nor was it to his ſecret retirements that his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was limited: it was manifeſted in every part of the day, and appeared in his uſual intercourſe with men. In the little vacancies of time which occur to the buſieſt of mankind, he was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:025154_0287_0FCE74AE4F7A95E0"/>
lifting up his ſoul to GOD. When he lectured on philoſophy, hiſtory, anatomy, or other ſubjects not immediately theological, he would endeavour to graft ſome religious inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon them, that he might raiſe the minds of his pupils to devotion, as well as to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and in his viſits to his people the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian friend and miniſter were united.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 260, 263.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Doddridge entertained a high idea of the efficacy of prayer.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>41.</note> It is a point upon which I would ſpeak with great humility and deference; but I cannot avoid thinking that, in this reſpect, he carried his ſentiments ſomewhat farther than reaſon and truth will warrant. Of the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of prayer, as a natural and juſt tribute to the Deity, as an admirable method of cheriſhing the virtues of the religious life, and as connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the divine approbation and favour, no one, I truſt, can be more truly ſenſible than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. My views of the matter have lately been ſo fully diſplayed, that they cannot be liable to any miſconſtruction.<note n="‡" place="bottom">

                  </gap>
               </note> But ſtill I am obliged to obſerve, that Dr. Doddridge did not, in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, ſufficiently limit his notions of the efficacy of prayer. He appeared to aſcribe to it ſuch an immediate influence upon the Supreme mind, and to expect from it ſuch interpoſitions, as are ſcarcely conſiſtent with the regular order of Providence, and the ſtated courſe of events in the world. If, however, he erred upon this head, he has erred with many wiſe and good
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:025154_0288_0FCE74B0A51C0FA0"/>
men who have gone before him, and by whom he has been ſucceeded. Perhaps Dr. Price and Dr. Ogden may be added to the number.</p>
            <p>The piety of Dr. Doddridge was accompanied with the warmeſt benevolence to his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. No one could more ſtrongly feel that the love of GOD was to be united with love to man. Nor was this a principle that reſted in kind wiſhes and pathetic feelings for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, but was manifeſted in the moſt active exertions for their welfare. No ſcheme of doing good was ever propoſed to him into which he did not enter with ardour. This was apparent from many circumſtances that might copiouſly be enlarged upon, did it comport with my preſent purpoſe. His Sermon for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the County Hoſpital at Northampton has been ſpoken of before; and it may here be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he not only contributed generouſly to that hoſpital, but ſpent much time in ripening the deſign. He often reflected, with great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, on the pains he had taken to eſtabliſh this charity, and on the good effects which it had produced, both in relieving many objects of diſtreſs, and in promoting a ſocial and catholic ſpirit among perſons of different parties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions. It was at his own expenſe that he printed and diſtributed his "Friendly Letter to the Private Soldiers of a Regiment of Foot." During the rebellion of 1745, he was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly zealous in the cauſe of his king and his country, and contributed to the raiſing of a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the command of the earl of Halifax, by his own liberality, as well as by his influence
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:025154_0289_0FCE74B1EB859230"/>
over others. In the caſe of a poor Iriſhman, whom he thought to be unjuſtly condemned for murder, he exerted himſelf in a very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, though without ſucceſs. But the generoſity of his mind was the moſt diſplayed when any ſchemes for propagating religion, and for ſpreading the goſpel among thoſe who were ſtrangers to it, were propoſed. In every thing of this kind he was always ready to take the lead, and was ardent in endeavouring to inſpire his friends with the ſame ſpirit.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 178—181.</note>
            </p>
            <p>No one could be more amiable than Dr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge was in his private virtues and manners. It would be needleſs to enlarge on the tenderneſs of his affections as a huſband, a father, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: nor is it neceſſary to inſiſt upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to his pupils. If he occaſionally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed any one of them by his particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, this did not hinder his behaving to all of them with the kindneſs of a parent; and his regard to them was never abated, excepting from their own fault. In the character of a friend he ſhone with diſtinguiſhed luſtre. Of friendſhip he entertained a ſublime idea, and his heart was admirably fitted for diſcharging all the offices, and reliſhing all the delights, of this endearing connection. It was the happy lot of his life to be honoured with many valuable and faithful friends; and how ſenſible he was of his felicity in this reſpect was diſplayed in every return of gratitude, eſteem, and affection,<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 132.</note> His deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in company was ſtrikingly polite, affable, and agreeable; and in converſation he greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled;
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:025154_0290_0FCE74B3842D61B8"/>
his diſcourſe being at once inſtructive and entertaining, and not unfrequently riſing to the ſplendid.</p>
            <p>The candour of Dr. Doddridge's mind rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his ſentiments of other perſons merit, was carried to the higheſt pitch, and indeed was ſometimes ſo exceſſive as to lead him to form a far better opinion of ſeveral of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance than in fact they deſerved. This fault was gently and pleaſantly touched upon by Mr. Barker, in one of his letters.
<q>But are you aware,</q>
ſays he,
<q>what a creature you are? I love you beyond expreſſion, and admire your abilities, furniture, ſpirits, &amp;c. more than you imagine; and not a man in the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices more in your uſefulneſs than I do; and yet I often make myſelf merry with your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and conduct. You are ſo entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to GOD, to truth, and holineſs, that it is very eaſy to impoſe upon you under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any of theſe. And you are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly made up of civility, candour, and good nature, that a pious enthuſiaſt, or a godly dunce, is welcome to your table, arms, and heart. You are ſo good yourſelf, that you think every body ten times better than they are; ſee merit in the darkneſs of midnight; cannot ſee faults without a noon-day ſun; forgive injuries before they are confeſſed; and confer favours as a reward for affronts.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters, ubi ſupra, p. 139.</note> With ſuch a diſpoſition of mind, it is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing that Dr. Doddridge ſhould frequently be unable to reſiſt the arts of deception: and
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:025154_0291_0FCE74B7F5BF3F30"/>
yet this did not proceed from a general ignorance of the world. He was well acquainted with men and with manners, and could often enter into, and diſcriminate, with no ſmall degree of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, the characters of mankind. But, at the ſame time, ſo ardent were the feelings of his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and ſuch was the ſuavity of his temper, that he could not eaſily perſuade himſelf that any perſons were inſincere, who made a profeſſion of religion and goodneſs. There is a conſiderable difference between a ſpeculative and a practical knowledge of the world. A man may poſſeſs much of the former, and yet, from a certain flexibility and tenderneſs of mind, have little of the latter. In particular inſtances, he may have ſagacity enough to ſuſpect deceit, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to indulge the ſuſpicion, leſt it ſhould lead him to err in his judgment, and be a motive for obſtructing the exertions of his benevolence. Such was the caſe with Dr. Doddridge, and ſuch, alſo, was the caſe with George Lord Lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telton. They would both of them rather have choſen to be miſtaken, than to have loſt an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of contributing to the relief of real diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>In his ſentiments of thoſe who differed from him in religious opinions, Dr. Doddridge exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed great moderation. He never confined truth or goodneſs to one particular ſect; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with the utmoſt candour to the members of the church of England. Of the eſtabliſhed religion of his country he always ſpoke with reſpect; and he never made any petulant objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to its worſhip or diſcipline, or uttered
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:025154_0292_0FCE74B96D9FCF40"/>
againſt it any ſevere or unkind reflections. His correſpondence with various clergymen of the higheſt rank and merit has heretofore been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed. It was deeply lamented by him, that a ſeparation from the eſtabliſhment was, in his apprehenſion, and that of many other good men, rendered ſo neceſſary; and he ſincerely wiſhed and prayed for a greater union among Proteſtants. A like candid and friendly ſpirit he endeavoured to promote among his pupils; and he did it with ſucceſs; for few of them, I believe, can be mentioned, who have not, in this reſpect, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the inſtructions and imitated the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their tutor.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ubi ſupra, p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some time after he had ſet up his academy at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, a proſecution was commenced againſt him in the eccleſiaſtical court, by the inſtigation of ſeveral dignitaries of the church. The ſtep, however, was totally diſapproved of by many other eminent members of the eſtabliſhment. Nevertheleſs, the perſons who had engaged in the buſineſs ſeemed determined to carry it on with vigour; and, as the laws then ſtood, they muſt have ſucceded in their deſign, had not an application been made to King George the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, who received, from ſome gentlemen of rank and influence, ſuch a juſt repreſentation of the Doctor's loyal, peaceable, and moderate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and character, as induced his Majeſty to give an expreſs order for putting a ſtop to the proſecution.<note place="bottom">

               <pb n="295" facs="unknown:025154_0293_0FCE74BB52A19B88"/>That candour of mind which Dr. Doddridge exerciſed towards the members of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed church, was cultivated by him with regard to his diſſenting brethren, of different denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. He was ſolicitous to be upon friendly terms, as far as poſſible, with all of them; and by the generality of them he was held in high eſtimation. If this was not the caſe without exception, it will not appear ſurpriſing to thoſe who reflect upon the diverſities of ſentiment that are found among the diſſenters. There were a few among them who even went ſo far as to charge him with inſincerity. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation they brought againſt him was, that he uſed ſome particular phraſes, in his writings, in a ſenſe different from that in which he himſelf underſtood them, in order to pleaſe a party. A friend having acquainted him with this charge, he anſwered as follows:
<q>My conſcience doth not tell me that I am at all to blame on the head you mention. I write for the public (as I would alſo do in every private correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) as in the preſence of GOD, and in the views of his judgment. I would not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that phantom, popularity, which is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en owing to the very worſt part of a man's character or performances, by any complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beneath the dignity of a chriſtian miniſter; an office, of which I think ſo highly, as to be deeply ſenſible how unworthy I am to bear it. On the other hand, I do indeed deſire to give as little offence as I honeſtly can; and I have high authorities for it: and though I am, and always declare that I am, in my judgment, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:025154_0294_0FCE74C05D140010"/>
againſt the impoſition of human phraſes, yet, as ſome can hardly be avoided on the one hand or the other, I chooſe to adopt and uſe ſome that are ambiguous, in what I take to be a fair ſenſe, though not the only ſenſe they might bear; and by declaring it, to endeavour to fix a good idea to them, rather than abſolutely to declare againſt, or even totally to diſuſe them. Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, wider by far in their ſentiments than I, are indulged in this, and even applauded for it: I have the misfortune (I cannot uſe the word more properly) to be condemned.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 221.</note> Whilſt I have a full conviction of Dr. Doddridge's ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in this matter, I cannot agree with him in opinion. Offenſive expreſſions may juſtly be avoided; but ſurely, ambiguous ones ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſignedly be adopted. The language we uſe, in delivering our views of things, ought to be natural, clear, and capable only of one ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The charge I have mentioned againſt Dr. Doddridge with regard to his writings, has been extended to his preaching. By ſome of his enemies it was aſſerted, that he was a trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the pulpit. The fact, I am ſatisfied, was preciſely as follows. When he preached in different places, he ſo far accommodated himſelf to the diſpoſitions of the people before whom he diſcourſed, as to avoid giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. If a congregation conſiſted of perſons who were of free ſentiments in religion, his ſermon was entirely of a practical nature. On the other hand, in preaching before a Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:025154_0295_0FCE74C49FFB4180"/>
ſociety, it was cuſtomary with him to chooſe what was called an evangelical ſubject. In neither caſe did he deliver any thing that was contrary to his ſincere opinion. His accuſers did not ſufficiently recollect that he was far more devoted to what were deemed the orthodox doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines than they were ready to imagine; and he had an undoubted right to be believed, when he declared, as he has done in the letter before cited.
<q>On the whole, I know aſſuredly, that I have not on any occaſion belied the real ſentiments of my heart.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 222.</note> The perſons who were moſt diſpoſed to find fault with Dr. Doddridge, with reſpect to the point in queſtion, were thoſe who are entitled the rational diſſenters. They could not eaſily perſuade themſelves that a man of ſuch abilities, and general liberality of mind, could entertain very different opinions from their own; and they wiſhed to have him rank more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly among them. It cannot be denied, that in one or two inſtances they had ſome reaſon to complain of his timidity: but, at the ſame time, there were many occaſions on which he behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a very becoming fortitude. Once, I remember, ſome narrow-minded people of his congregation gave him no ſmall trouble on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a gentleman, in communion with the church, who was a profeſſed Arian, and who otherwiſe departed from the common ſtandard of orthodoxy. This gentleman they wiſhed either to be excluded from the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, or to have his attendance upon it prevented. But the Doctor declared, that he
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:025154_0296_0FCE74C5B8EBB378"/>
would ſacrifice his place, and even his life, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than fix any ſuch mark of diſcouragement upon one, who, whatever his doctrinal ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were, appeared to be a real chriſtian. When our author happened to be in company with perſons of rank and fortune, he never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the leaſt tendency to profaneneſs or licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs to paſs unnoticed; but manifeſted his diſlike to them, with the freedom of the divine, accompanied with the politeneſs of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. A correſpondent having charged him with unſoundneſs in one of his publications, his only anſwer was, <hi>Quod ſcripſi, ſcripſi</hi>;<note n="†" place="bottom">Letters to a young Clergyman, p. 103.</note>

            </p>
            <p>How ſincerely Dr. Doddridge deteſted the want of integrity in character, was diſplayed in the following fact. One of his pupils was in the habit of making a jeſt of what is called or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy, and of ridiculing thoſe who adhered to it; and this he continued to do, up to the time in which he began to preach. Then, to the no ſmall ſurpriſe of his intimate acquaintance, it was rumoured, that in the congregations where he had officiated in the neighbourhood of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, he had appeared highly Calviniſtical, and indeed much more ſo than almoſt any other of his fellow-ſtudents. For obvious reaſons he declined ever preaching at Northampton. At length, the affair was brought before the Doctor; and both parts of the charge having been proved by deciſive evidence, the young man was diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Being a perſon of ſome fortune, he was not involved by his diſgrace in any pecuniary diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>

               <pb n="299" facs="unknown:025154_0297_0FCE74C700157818"/>With that impartiality which is the duty of every biographer, I have mentioned, in the courſe of my narrative, the inſtances wherein it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me that the character of Dr. Doddridge was ſhaded with ſome degree of imperfection. The ſame impartiality obliges me to add, that, at times, he had too oftentatious a manner of ſpeaking concerning the multiplicity of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, engagements, and correſpondences; and that he was fonder of applauſe, from every quarter, than was deſirable in one who was ſo juſtly entitled to it, where applauſe was an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. I have often thought that in certain points he had a reſemblance of Cicero. He reſembled him in the love of fame, and in not poſſeſſing what may be called the ſternneſs of fortitude. He reſembled him likewiſe in more eſtimable qualities; in the copiouſneſs, diffuſion, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos of his eloquence; and in the ſenſibilities and tenderneſs of his mind, eſpecially as diſplayed in the loſs of a daughter.</p>
            <p>When all Dr. Doddridge's imperfections are collected together, they will be found to have been very trifling in compariſon with his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies. One or two more of his virtues I ſhall touch upon before I conclude. Few have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the exerciſe of humility, both with relation to GOD and man. With reſpect to GOD, it was apparent in the deepeſt expreſſions of concern for the defects of his improvements and his ſervices; and with regard to man, it was manifeſted in his condeſcenſion to the meaneſt perſons, in his behaviour to his pupils, and in the patience with which he ſubmitted to the words
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:025154_0298_0FCE7556CE8C3A58"/>
of reproof. He was even highly thankful to his friends for pointing out to him what they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be amiſs in his conduct. The language of humility that was uſed by him, though undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſincere, was ſometimes carried to an exceſs. In a letter to Dr. Wood of Norwich, he thus expreſſes himſelf:
<q>Pity me, and pray for me, as you do, in the midſt of ſo many hurries. Oh, my poor, poor attempts of ſervice! They ſhame me continually. My prayers, my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, my lectures, my books (in hand) my letters, all daily ſhame me.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters to and from Dr. Doddridge, p. 307.</note> Nothing can vindicate ſuch humiliating terms from the charge of affectation but the remembrance that the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was written under a peculiar depreſſion of ſpirits, united with that ſtrong ſenſe which Dr. Doddridge always entertained of the ardour, zeal, and diligence, with which the duties of life ought to be performed.</p>
            <p>Among the Doctor's other excellencies, I might inſiſt upon the reſignation, ſerenity, and cheerfulneſs, with which he ſubmitted to the diſtreſſes of the preſent ſtate. One of his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and it was an affliction that called for the exerciſe of his meekneſs and patience, was the unkind treatment which he ſometimes met with from thoſe who owed to him a far different kind of behaviour. Few men leſs deſerved to be evil ſpoken of; but to paſs through the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproach is not the lot of the pureſt virtue. Some of his pupils were angry with him, and ſet themſelves to miſrepreſent his character, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not recommend them to places
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:025154_0299_0FCE3840FB6A1540"/>
they wiſhed for, but for which he conſcientiouſly judged them to be unqualified. His kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to them in other reſpects did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate, in their eſtimation, for the wound he had given to their ſelf-opinion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Orton, ubi ſupra, p. 229</note> This is a difficulty which has been experienced by others, who, from their ſituations among the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are ſuppoſed to have any influence in recommending to vacant congregations. Dr. Doddridge was even aſperſed in the caſe of a guardianſhip, where he had acted with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt probity, friendſhip, and benevolence.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 23<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Whatever was the ill uſuage to which he was expoſed, he ſuſtained it with mildneſs, and was always ready to manifeſt a forgiving temper. Nothing could be farther from his character than a reſentful diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, Dr. Doddridge was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great man, but one of the moſt excellent and uſeful chriſtians, and chriſtian miniſters, that ever exiſted. The impreſſion of his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and amiable virtues will not be effaced from my mind ſo long as it retains any ſenſe of feeling or reflection. So far will be the impreſſion from being loſt upon me, that I ſhall always cheriſh it with the utmoſt ardour; and I eſteem it as no ſmall felicity of my life, that I have been preſerved to give this teſtimony of duty, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and affection, to the memory of my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, my tutor, my friend, and my father.</p>
