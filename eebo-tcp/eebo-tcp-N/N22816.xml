            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CAUSE OF MAN.</head>
            <p>HUMAN nature has been a theme of much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion. Among the ancients, ſome railed at man, and ſome ridiculed his imperfections. Certain modern philoſophers make depravity<note n="*" place="bottom">Critics may remember, that <hi>depravity,</hi> through the whole of this piece, ſignifies ſuch a diſpoſition of heart as wiſhes univerſal diffuſion of wretchedneſs.</note> a part of their creed; and aſſign the moſt elevated ſeat in Paradiſe to thoſe, who feel the moſt perfect contempt for human nature. The catechiſms of theſe ſages inform us, that man is malevolent; that his paſſions hurry him into wretchedneſs; and that his underſtanding is only another name for imperfection. Should individuals offer this for a deſcription of their own minds, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps juſtice might read the character with ſilent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. When 'tis produced as the picture of man, the ſame juſtice commands to wipe the aſperſion from the portrait of our common nature.</p>
            <p>If exalted actions flow from elevated ſentiments, then, to eſtabliſh human dignity, and reaſon man into approbation of himſelf, muſt be among the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements towards virtue.</p>
            <p>Be it, therefore, our taſk, to plead the cauſe of man.</p>
            <p>Let us examine his diſpoſition; conſider the utility of his paſſions; ſurvey the perfection of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and obſerve how far ſurrounding creation ſtands as monumental teſtimony of human greatneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:030139_0003_0FE4A6DC694BAF90"/>From the ſituation of man, we may argue the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of benevolence in his diſpoſition. He was, doubtleſs, formed for happineſs. His deſire of bliſs, and his powers of fruition, evince the truth of this aſſertion. His felicity depends, almoſt entirely, on ſocial intercourſe. Solitary, man is in want, in fear, in diſconſolation. A reciprocation of beneficence alone can make him happy. This he muſt be diſpoſed to perform, or he cannot fulfil the final cauſe of his nature. Man's deſtination for happineſs, and his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dependence, therefore, clearly originate the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of human benevolence.</p>
            <p>Feeling and experience evince the benevolent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of man. A ſight of diſtreſs wounds the heart. A view of joy warms the ſoul with gladneſs. We are pleaſed to remove pain. We rejoice to communicate delight. Theſe things we could not perform without a diſpoſition to diffuſe felicity. This diſpoſition is all we mean by benevolence.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the heart of man malevolent, he muſt then loſe every ſocial ſatisfaction. For who could receive thoſe mutual favours, which none were diſpoſed to beſtow? Man muſt be condemned to ſolitary miſery. Never would he wipe a tear from the eye of ſorrow; never would he pour the balm of conſolation into the boſom of grief. Nay, he would grieve at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of joy. He would eagerly diſſeminate wretchedneſs. Every benefaction of Providence would ſwell the tide of human miſery; and man could never ſmile undiſturbed, while one joyous emotion exiſted, even in the boſom of Deity. Muſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve man endowed with ſuch a diſpoſition? Yes, if we believe him malevolent. But can our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, our feelings, our experience, ſubſcribe to ſuch a creed? No. For neceſſity and ſympathy both evince man benevolent. Nor could he be otherwiſe, unleſs his ſoul were blacker than the dunneſt fiend that fear-diſtempered fancy ever generated in the dark regions of mythology.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:030139_0004_0FE4A6CFF60B0D70"/>Though man ſtands vindicated from the charge of malevolence, yet has calumny blackened his character with other accuſations.</p>
            <p>Human paſſions have often been a mark for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of contumely. Auſterity condemns them, becauſe they are ſometimes irregular. As well might the ſame auſterity curſe the elements of nature, becauſe the thunder, the earthquake, or the hurricane, ſometimes rend an oak, ſplit a mountain, or ſweep a kingdom into the ocean.</p>
            <p>If we impartially look on our own nature, the utility of our paſſions muſt appear.</p>
            <p>Man is, at times, in danger. Danger originates the neceſſity of caution, and caution is ſecured by the paſſion of fear.</p>
            <p>Unreſiſting innocence invites the hand of oppreſſion. To prevent a repetition of injury, omniſcient Deity planted the ſeed of anger in the boſom of man.</p>
            <p>Self love, to ſome the moſt odious of all the paſſions, is ſtill an emanation of benevolence. Like that, it has for its object the diffuſion of felicity. It firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures our own enjoyment. It then offers our boſom to a parent, to a friend, to our country, to the indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate citizens of the world. Thus on ſelf love are grafted philanthropy, patriotiſm, friendſhip, and all the tender growths of domeſtic charity.</p>
            <p>A love of glory is the moſt violent, extenſive and durable, of all the paſſions. For glory, men encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter toil, danger, and death itſelf. No pain, no labour, no toilſome virtue, no arduous heroiſm, can be a price too dear to purchaſe immortal renown. A paſſion which thus diſpoſes men to ſacrifice eaſe, ſafety, and life itſelf, to gain the applauſe of their fellow men, muſt inviolably unite mankind, and lodge in every breaſt a pledge for the ſocial exertions of each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual.</p>
            <p>Let the votaries of apathy decry the paſſions. What can be the felicity, what the virtue, of their paſſionleſs philoſopher? If man were void of ſelf love, would
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030139_0005_0FE4A6E26FE9CEE0"/>
the voice of native want rouze him from the ſleep of indolence? What would ſhield his boſom from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, what would arm his hand with power, if fear did not teach him caution, and anger learn him to reſiſt the aggreſſions of violence? Who would toil for man? who, with a ſmile, would bleed on the altar of eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation, if the God of nature had not with love of glory warmed the boſom of man? Deſtitute of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, man had ſtood, like the marble ſtatue, without a motion; and eternally worn the ſame ſmile or frown which the laſt touch of nature's hand left impreſſed on his countenance.</p>
            <p>Underſtanding claims our next attention. This forms a ſplendid part of human nature. By this man perceives, remembers, reaſons and imagines. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and memory principally ſubſerve the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of reaſon and imagination.</p>
            <p>Guided by reaſon, man has travelled through the abſtruſe regions of the philoſophic world. He has originated rules by which he can direct the ſhip through the pathleſs ocean, and meaſure the comet's flight over the fields of unlimited ſpace. He has eſtabliſhed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and government. He can aggregate the profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of every climate, and every ſeaſon. He can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorate the ſeverity, and remedy the imperfections, of nature herſelf. All theſe things he can perform by the aſſiſtance of reaſon.</p>
            <p>By imagination, man ſeems to verge towards crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power. Aided by this, he can perform all the wonders of ſculpture and painting. He can almoſt make the marble ſpeak. He can almoſt make the brook murmur down the painted landſcape. Often, on the pinions of imagination, he ſoars aloft where the eye has never travelled; where other ſtars glitter on the mantle of night, and a more effulgent ſun lights up the bluſhes of morning. Flying from world to world, he gazes on all the glories of creation: or, lighting on the diſtant margin of the univerſe, darts the eye of fancy over the mighty void, where power
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030139_0006_0FE4A6CCE164CC30"/>
creative never yet has energized, where exiſtence ſtill ſleeps in the wide abyſs of poſſibility. By imagination he can travel back to the ſource of time; converſe with the ſucceſſive generations of men, and kindle into emulation while he ſurveys the monumental tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of ancient art and glory. He can ſail down the ſtream of time until he loſes <q>ſight of ſtars and ſun, by wandering into thoſe retired parts of eternity, when the heavens and the earth ſhall be no more.*</q>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe unequivocal characteriſtics of greatneſs in man, let us adduce the teſtimony of nature herſelf. Surrounding creation ſubſerves the wants and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims the dignity of man. For him day and night viſit the world. For him the ſeaſons walk their ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did round. For him the earth teems with riches, and the heavens ſmile with beneficence.</p>
            <p>All creation is accurately adjuſted to his capacity for bliſs. He taſtes the dainties of feſtivity, breathes the perfumes of morning, revels on the charms of melody, and regales his eye with all the painted beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of viſion. Whatever can pleaſe, whatever can charm, whatever can expand the ſoul with extacy of bliſs, allures and ſolicits his attention. All things beautiful, all things grand, all things ſublime, appear in native lovelineſs, and proffer man the richeſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of fruition.</p>
            <p>Can he then raiſe his feelings too high in the ſcale of ſelf approbation? Can he ſufficiently abhor that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely which perpetually babbles of human depravity? In man, is it not calumny againſt heaven? Is it not pointing the arrow of ingratitude againſt the munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent boſom of a God?</p>
            <p>If man can rejoice in diffuſion of felicity, is he not, like his Creator, benevolent? If his paſſions urge him to embrace the common intereſt of man, are they not uſeful? If his underſtanding guides him down the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of exiſtence, is it not perfect? If ſurrounding creation waits on his wants, does it not, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030139_0007_0FE4A6D866F42EE8"/>
of its Creator, talk aloud of human greatneſs? Do not all theſe ſhining tints brighten on the portrait of man? Yes. He rejoices in munificence; he toils for univerſal felicity; he developes the myſteries of nature; he aggregates the goods of ſpace, of dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and even arreſts the attention of earth and heaven.</p>
            <p>This thought elevates man high on the theatre of exiſtence, and places him full in view of a ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing univerſe. It gives him an important part in the great drama of being. It tells him all intelligence are intereſted in the ſucceſs of his performance.</p>
            <p>Yes, my countrymen, you arreſt the attention of ſhining millions. On you are fixed the eyes of all that bright throng of departed patriots, philoſophers and philanthropiſts, who meaſured their atchievements by the dignity of their nature; and whoſe beatified ſpirits, now leaning from the azure battlements of heaven, allure their followers up the ſhining road to glory. You they hail as their genuine deſcendents; as the patrons of ſcience; as the votaries of virtue; as the candidates of immortal beatitude.</p>

               <p>On this occaſion, ſhould we attempt to narrate the merits of our benefactor, modeſty might raiſe a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of adulation; envy would deduce our panegyric from the partiality of our hearts; while the world would inform us, that the ſcience, knowledge and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthrophy, of the man who has obliged us, are now become a theme of common converſation. We can, therefore, expreſs our gratitude only; and ardently wiſh that others, in purſuit of ſcience, may have the ſame director who has guided our ſteps.</p>
               <p>Yes, if ever our ſouls, in the ſilent moments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, have dared to heave a wiſhing ſigh to heaven for a ſingle favour on ourſelves—often, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his face no more, often ſhall that wiſh be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the health and felicity of him, whom genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions yet unknown ſhall learn to call their benefactor. The world ſhall join in our devotion: a prayer ſo benevolent muſt aſcend grateful to the ear of heaven; and the immortal ſpirit of great MANNING, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate companion of the LAMB, ſhall, with a ſmile of gratulation, behold <hi>you</hi> ſtill the <hi>Father</hi> of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan ſeminary.</p>

as recollection can extend its eye, we behold each of your actions towards us riſing up, like the kindneſs of a parent, and irreſiſtibly charming us into grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. From you we have received the precepts of ſcience. From you we have learned the philoſophy of morals. While the lore of wiſdom has flowed from your tongues, your examples have allured us into love of virtue and religion, or left us wicked beyond the reach of palliation.</p>
               <p>We know your boſoms throb with parental anxiety for our proſperous reception in life. We are aſſured we ſhall have all the favours of your friendſhip, all the bleſſings heaven can beſtow on your prayers.</p>

               <p>I AM unwilling to leave the ſtage at this time, without addreſſing a few words to you. You are ſtill in the career of collegiate acquiſition. Still you enjoy thoſe means of information which are now forever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from us. Pant not with too much eagerneſs for the day of emancipation. On that day, you will think the moments of your collegiate exiſtence have been few.</p>
               <p>College is the world in miniature. There you may learn, not ſcience only, but man himſelf. There you may examine each principle which actuates the human

heart. There you may trace every paſſion from its firſt dawn, involved in the ſhades of kindred emotions, through all its various phaſes, until it blazes out in all the meridian glow of action.</p>
               <p>The votary of that ſcience which does not mend the heart, is, by its influence, tranſmuted into tenfold more a child of reprobation. Keep, therefore, your boſoms alive to all the exquiſite emotions of virtue.</p>
               <p>Suffer not a noble emulation, by eagerneſs of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, to be degenerated into envy. Envy triumphs only in the expiring agonies of merit.</p>
               <p>Beware of that paſſion which throws the dun mantle of ſuſpicion over the white boſom of innocence.</p>
               <p>Liſten not to the whiſper of ſlander. Slander in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves merit in darkneſs; as the black cloud of the north rolls over the brightneſs of heaven.</p>
               <p>My good friends, live without a fault, and you ſhall live without a ſigh, unleſs it be the ſigh of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy.</p>

               <p>OFTEN, on ſimilar occaſions, from this place, the world has heard the pathetic narration of colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate joys that are paſt. I will not pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine why this has been done. This narration may be all reality. It may be a cuſtomary ſtory, told to lure from the eyes of pitying ſpectators the tear of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as a tribute grateful to valedician eloquence. It may be an ingenious artifice, woven to conceal the loathſome viſage of claſſical animoſity.</p>
               <p>Far from me be a wiſh to diſguiſe the truth. Yet,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030139_0012_0FE4A6F00AE72EF8"/>
if we have had enmities, why may we not ceaſe to feel them? Why may not the white hand of charity throw the veil of forgetfulneſs over thoſe parts of our claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical exiſtence, which we cannot recollect without a painful emotion? Never will our boſoms ſoften with a warmer glow of forgiveneſs. Never, perhaps, ſhall we all meet again, till we meet beyond the narrow ſea of time. Let us, therefore, on this day, ſolemnize the funeral of expiring enmity. Let us plant on its tomb the green olive of friendſhip. Let us part as brothers.</p>
               <p>Muſt we then part? Yes, the dark curtain of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is now drawing between us. In a few hours we behold each others faces no more. To-morrow's ſun ſhall ſee us ſcattered over the face of the world. We muſt now reciprocate a laſt adieu before a gazing mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. This taſk is ungrateful. Parting friends, like parting lovers, wiſh to lean on each others boſoms, and ſigh a fond farewell in ſome ſequeſtered ſhade, where no grief-unhallowed eye can violate the tender intercourſe.</p>
               <p>Are not we of that deſcription? Are not we friends? Can it be otherwiſe? Memory is witneſs too faithful. Never, never can he who now addreſſes you, ceaſe to feel the obligations of gratitude. When pale diſeaſe <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſpeaker, while in College, was ſick of a fever.

O my God! with thy tremendous bolt transfix this heart, if ever it ceaſe to glow with joy at the joy of theſe my friends, or to melt with ſorrow at their woes.</p>
               <p>My good brothers, we this day launch out on the billowy ocean of life. A world lies before us. He
