            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN the former part of this Epistle the Apostle hath been confuting that Corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive Doctrine which some false teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had been sowing among the <hi>Galatians</hi> and wherewith they were many of them deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The Corrupt doctrine which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes is this, that Believers were both obliged to, and justified by the works of the Law, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by observing the Ceremonial Law. Having at large Confuted this pernicious Error in this Chapter, he first exhorts them to stand fast in that Evangelical Liberty that Christ had made them free withal <hi>ver. 1.</hi> which he presseth from the momentousness, of it <hi>Christ else would profit them nothing:</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:000375_0003_0FA4FD1FC7464A18"/>
they would be obliged to the keeping of the whole Law, Christ would be of no effect to them, and they would else fall from Grace. In the next place he directs them what course to take to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the further spreading of this so dangerous a Contagion, <hi>namely</hi> to cut off the pertinacious preachers of this damnable doctrine; and he first laid down a general principal which he elsewhere makes use of on the like Occasion, See 1. <hi>Cor. 5. 6.</hi> 'Tis a proverbial &amp; Metaphorical speech that they were all in danger of being infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unless such were <hi>Cut off,</hi> A Sin or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in a Church easily Catcheth and spreadeth, because the Members are all members one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as <hi>Rom. 12.</hi> or all of the same Lump, that there is a spiritual union, nearness, and Conjunction between them by Virtue of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Christ; and thence if they do not purge out such corrupt Leaven, the Defilement is easily diffused with great Celerity and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy over the whole lump. Next he insinuates himselfe by professing his confident perswasion and hope that they would readily be of the same mind with him &amp; put in Practice this his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ver. 10.</hi> to give impartial Judgment upon all that troubled them: So the Apostle calls the proceeding of the Church in order to Censure <hi>I. Cor. 5. 12.</hi> adding <hi>ver. 11.</hi> that himself for the contrary Doctrine to this. (whereby they were troubled, and wherewith they had
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000375_0004_0FA4FD1FEC0CB008"/>
been infected) suffered persecution; thereby Intimating that it was not too heavy a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they who troubled them with this new gospel, should suffer Excomunication; For either he must have bin utterly out in all his sufferings of persecutions, yea &amp; in his persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in preaching otherwise, tho' multitudes stumbled at the Gospel thereby; or else all these corrupt teachers deserved well to be cut off, who preached a way of Salvation contrary to what he had both suffered for the Preaching of; yea and (which was more) given great offence by preaching. Having thus made his way, he tells them <hi>ver. 12.</hi> what he would have done with those that unsetled them in their former orderly walking and believing and professing, even that they should be cut off. But lest any should say, why do you thus write unto us? what have we to do to cut them off? he adds. <hi>ver. 13.</hi> that God had called them to Liberty, <hi>that is</hi> God had called and brought them into such an estate by the Gospel, wherein they had a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of acting according to their place, in and for the cutting off of those that troubled them. Not that private members may cast out their Teachers by any Office-Authority over them, but that they have an interest of liberty and priviledge to act in obedience to Christ and in obedience to their Officers that are sound <hi>2. Cor. 10. 6.</hi> in a way of passing a free &amp; consciencious
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000375_0005_0FA4FD20DD58D910"/>
Judgment on such as are unsound so as to reject them. But because Churches are too apt in the use of this their liberty to fall into abusing of it, he presently gives a needful warning and caution, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that they used not this their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as an occasion to the flesh <hi>i. e.</hi> Take heed not to act and vent their own corruptions, by and in the using of this their liberty: But Churches being so exceeding subject to misuse their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he contents not himself with giving that Caution, But further adds directions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by them, that they may not fall to the abuse of this their Liberty.</p>
            <p>Direct, 1. <hi>Serve one another by love</hi> ver. 13. backed with two arguments,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the large and happy Influence of so doing, all the Law is fulfilled thereby <hi>ver. 14.</hi> It would lead them on to the doing of all the duties required in the Law, wherein he secretly girds at those that would have brought them under the Law again. <hi>q. d.</hi> If you would needs be under the Law, here's an excellent way of being under it to Christ <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> serving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the Evils and Mischief that attended the contrary practice, <hi>ver. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Is ver. 2. <hi>Walk in the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you would not use your liberty as an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the Flesh for the acting and venting of corruption, then <hi>walk in the spirit,</hi> i. e. <hi>in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000375_0006_0FA4FD2161D53D58"/>
of Grace.</hi> This direction the Apostle backs with a four fold argument.</p>
            <p>Argum. 1. So doing <hi>ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.</hi> which he proves from the Contrariety between the flesh and the Spirit <hi>ver. 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arg. 2. So doing it will appear that <hi>ye are not under the Law <hi>ver.</hi> 18.</hi> (being led by the spirit and walking in the spirit are all one in sense) <hi>i. e.</hi> not under the Law to be condemned by it. This the Apostle makes out, &amp; withall explains what he means by the lusts of the Flesh and the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>ver. 19, to 24.</hi> Of the lusts of the flesh, he faith that they are manifest, that they shut out from inheriting the Kingdom of God; and most of those that he names are such as people are most apt to fall into in the use of their foresaid Church-liberty <hi>ver. 20, 21.</hi> the fruits of the spirit that he instanceth in are mostly such as should shine out in Churches using their liberty, and against such he sayes there is no law that shall condemn them, they are not under the condemning power of the Law. Perhaps also the Apostle had his eye on the Circumcision, and Mosaical days and Rites mention'd <hi>Chapt. 4.</hi> which the false Teachers said were of such Necessity, that there was a Law against those that observed them not, therefore faith the Apostle, if you will tye Christians up thus, there are things which, it's past
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000375_0007_0FA4FD240FD02FF0"/>
all question <hi>there is no law against</hi> therefore look to these.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third Argument why they should walk in the Spirit, is because they had crucifyed the the Flesh with the lusts and affections thereof <hi>ver. 24.</hi> and 'tis a very uncomly and incongrous thing for Saints to be led by a crucified thing, and if they be not led by the Spirit, they must and should be led by the flesh.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A fourth Argument for their walking in the Spirit is, because they were alive in or by the Spirit <hi>ver. 25.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. A third Direction that the Apostle gives how Saints may eschew the abusing of their Liberty is that they <hi>should not be desirous of vain glory ver. 26.</hi> if we be, we shall abuse our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as an occasion to the flesh, and use it in such a way as may be a provoking to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this desire of vain glory will put us upon envying one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. The fourth Direction is <hi>Chapt. 6. ver. 1.</hi> &amp; the design of it is to teach Christians in the use of their Liberty to make a difference between the miscariages of men. There are some that are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">

perhaps through weakness they may be by surprizal entangled and catch'd in some carnal and ungospel-like Opinion or practice, yet they are not obstinate or incurable therein. To such, and in such cases, you must walk other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if you would use your liberty and that power which Members have mutually one over another aright. These you must not presently <hi>cut off</hi> but you that are spiritual must with a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekness labour the Restoring of them: thus bearing one anothers burthens, and thus fulfilling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law of Christ as he is the Law-giver of his Church, &amp; hath given them Laws &amp; rules how to carry towards all sorts of offences and offenders in his Churches. <hi>Moral duties</hi> are the Commandments or Laws of God; but Church Rules and ordinances of meer <hi>Institution</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Lawes of Christ, as he is the Head and King and Law-giver of his Church.</p>

and not of bounden duty, at least as to the measure of it, and thence to deal fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; the Holy Ghost backs it with a solemn Caution, telling them that they had to doe with God in his matter, and not with Poor weak contemptible men whom they could wrong at pleasure: Also with a weighty argument that the Lords dispensing of his Grace and spiritual blessings by Ministers teaching, usually holds a proportion with peoples dealing with them in Carnal good things: their souls would thrive less or more, as they dealt with God in this matter of Communicating to his Ministers. This is the scope of <hi>ver. 7. 8.</hi> And lastly upon this occasion of Communicating to their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he adds a brief exhortation to perseverance in well doing in the General <hi>ver. 9.</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their beneficence to others also <hi>ver. 10.</hi> This is the <hi>Analysis</hi> and brief veiw of this latter part of this Epistle; which I confess I have the more insisted on, because it is not so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally observed.</p>

Quest. 1. <hi>What is here meant by the Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Spirit,</hi> in this Chapter is opposed to the <hi>Flesh:</hi> And hence as <hi>Flesh</hi> is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Coruption; So spirit is the principle of Grace. That divine Principle in the hearts of Saints, which is the spring and root of all new Obedience and holy actings in a Saints walk. And it is called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as for other reasons, so because it is the proper inseparable <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ffects of the Holy Spirit dwelling in a believer. And he is said to live in and by the Spirit, because by this principle of Grace in his heart, he is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually alive who by nature was dead <hi>i. e.</hi> alive to God, as <hi>Rom. 6. 11.</hi> Here is also an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition between the life or living of this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the death or crucifying of the flesh, <hi>ver. 24.</hi> which is the principle contrary to it <hi>q. d.</hi> Original sin is crucifyed and therefore you are not alive in and unto sin, but you are alive by the spirit, the Spirit of God dwelling in you hath quickned you to new obedience, or made you alive by creating a principle of Grace in your hearts, and this principle being not curcified (as sin is) but alive in us, we ought to walk in it.</p>
            <p>Quest. 2. <hi>What is meant by walking in the Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. Walking relates to all a Christians wayes and Actions. The Greek phrase here
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000375_0011_0FA4FD28E6EA0940"/>
used is a military word, used of Souldiers being set and marching in <hi>rank and file</hi> orderly, every one keeping his place: so that it extends to all the Acts of a Christians life. And these must be in the spirit, that is in the excercise of his spiritual gracious principles. That this is the sense of the phrase, appears from the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speech used by the Apostle concerning a Believer in his state of Unregeneracy, see <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 7. His former state was to be alive in his lusts opposed to his being now dead through Christ as to the life spoken of before <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and his former practice was a walking in these lusts, <hi>i. e.</hi> a practising, acting, &amp; fulfilling of them, a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the acting and exercise of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> then to be insisted on, is That <hi>'Tis the duty, and should be the care of a Christian to walk in the constant exercise of Grace,</hi> i. e. <hi>In the acting of those gracious principles that he received in his Regeneration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See <hi>ver.</hi> 16. This is that <hi>Living to the Lord</hi> that is required in the <hi>2. Cor.</hi> 5. 15. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 19. And indeed a Christian cannot be said to live any longer than he acts Grace: For tho he may have life in him, yet 'tis no act of life that is of his spiritual life except Grace be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it. As tis no Action of natural life that proceeds not from the union of soul and body
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000375_0012_0FA4FD29A5F41468"/>
together and their mutual clasping on each other so 'tis no act of spiritual life that proceeds not from the souls union with God and clasping about him in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What Grace must a Christian walk in the excercise of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. 1. The General Graces of a Christian that are never out of season nor ever unsuitable; what ever the case and condition of a person be; <hi>e. g.</hi> Faith, Fear, Thankfulness, and Love; Heavenly-mindedness, Watchfulness, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Those particular Graces, that a mans Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Employment, or Gods providence calls for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those which a mans Relation calls for.</hi> For the Grace which the relation of a wife calls for 1. Pet. 3. 2. So for servants <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those which a mans present Condition and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment calls for.</hi> If it be worshiping of God <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Psa.</hi> 5. 7. If it be restoring a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther overtaken with a fault, then exercise and shew forth a spirit of meekness <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those which God's present Providence calleth for,</hi> both particular and General, Inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: When God afflicts we must put on hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness and mourning as our garment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant attire in such a day, <hi>1. Pet.</hi> 5. 5, 6. If God favour, then beautyful garments or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of praise must be worn, <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 1. &amp; 61. 3.</p>
            <p>For the Reasons of this Doctrine, I shall goe no further then this Discourse of the Apostle in this Chapter,</p>
            <p>Reas. <hi>1. It will prevent your using your Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as an occasion to the Flesh, and fulfilling the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000375_0014_0FA4FD2B22485630"/>
Lusts of it.</hi> Of this there is great danger; we are very apt to it, Corruption is even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and active to get the Start of Grace, and be before hand with it if we take not heed; Yet this is a great Evil, thus to abuse God's Favour and our mercies. To prevent it, there is no way like this of a mans walking in the exercise of it Continually.</p>
            <p>Thus 'tis in their allowed delights and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoyments, and also in liberty given by the providence of God from subjection to others, from Temptations, from Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And in liberty given by the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and order of Christ in Church matters. and also Spiritual Liberty given by the Grace of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You shall not fulfil the Lusts of the Flesh.</hi> See <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Flagging in the Exercise of Grace and leting it fall, exposeth to the prev<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Temptations and Corruptions which hence come easily to grow up and get head over us: Hence they not only stir within and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, but Lead us Captive and prevail over us. If <hi>David, Noah, Lot, Peter</hi> had kept up the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Grace, they had not Fallen as they did. The Apostle makes this out, from the Contrariety between Grace and Sin, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. which is such that the exercise of one, keeps down the other: And lusts will mingle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in all we doe, if we walk not in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000375_0015_0FA4FD2C23705F58"/>
Exercise of Grace, then all we doe will become sin: and so be put among our sins for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, not our Obedience for Acceptance.</p>
            <p>Every thing we doe is a fruit of the Spirit or the flesh, and if Grace be not exercised 'tis then a fruit of the Flesh, not the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>Thus men come to fulfil the lusts of the Flesh, when they are doing duties that God calls for; Hence in mens callings, many men are but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the lust of covetousness and Love of the world.</p>
            <p>And in duties of worship, men thus come to be fulfilling a lust of pride and of Hypocrisie, yea of contempt of God, because not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping Him in faith, from Love and with Fear, they either look for Acceptance in it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Christ; or else heed not whether they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> accepted of God or not.</p>
            <p>Reas. <hi>This will clear it up that you are not under the Law but under Grace.</hi> See <hi>ver.</hi> 18. It will clear it up to others: for hereby Grace will shine out in you, and you will shew the vertues of Christ who hath called you. So <hi>Paul</hi> of the Churches of <hi>Macedonia 2. Cor.</hi> 8. 12. and of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 1 Epist. <hi>1. Chapt.</hi> 3, &amp; 4. <hi>ver.</hi> from their works of Faith and Labour of Love Concludeth their Election.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:000375_0016_0FA4FD2D8C1F5908"/>
It will clear it up to your selves in your own Consciences <hi>1. Joh.</hi> 3. 14, 18, 19. Por thus to be lead in the Spirit is a certain Sign of it, because the Law gives not the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>He whose state is to be under the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hath not Grace, and therefore cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise any, therefore if a man exercise Grace 'tis a certain Argument that he is in a New Covenant estate. <hi>Exercising Grace</hi> will Clear up your State, because Grace by Acting grows more and brighter, and thence more discernable: And because in this way the Spirit of God, the spirit of consolation, will reveal your State to you, enable you todiscern it clearly and judge of it certainly to your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Thus God dealt with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22. 12, 15. <hi>Now I know thou fearest meâ€”.</hi> And the Lord again reneweth his Covenant with him, and Confirms it with his Oath, for tho he made it before and gave him also a Seal of it, <hi>Circumcision;</hi> Yet I find not that the Lord Ratified it by his Oath till now. And observe it, that it is not the outward Act of Obedience that yeildeth peace and Assurance, or on which Consc<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nce can give a Testimony of a mans good estate, (for there is no outward Act but a Hypocrite may doe it, <hi>1. Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4.) but it is from the Exercise of grace in that Action, that in Simplicity and in Godly Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000375_0017_0FA4FD2E302D7730"/>
a man hath done it, as <hi>2. Cor.</hi> 1. 12. or that it was done to the Lord, or before the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> speaks <hi>2. Sam.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>And David said to Michal, It was before the Lord &amp;c.</hi> For our joy in every thing we doe, comes in by such a tryal of our own acting, as no other but wee our selves can be able to make thereof <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>But let every man prove his own work, and then he shall have rejoycing in himself alone, and not in another.</hi> And <hi>against such as so walk there is no Law</hi> that can cast and condemn them. For such have one in Heaven that hath satisfied the Law for all their breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of it. Hence exercising Grace is the only way to have the Comfort of Grace.</p>
            <p>Reas. 3. <hi>The flesh is Crucified with the affections and Lusts thereof</hi> ver. 24.</p>
            <p>Not only the principle of sin but all the inward Stirrings of it; whether blown up by Satan or rising up from the secret lustings of sin it self (so I think signifie the two words which the Apostle here useth) have received their death's wound; and thence are (tho not quite dead, yet) in a languishing dying Condition, and sure to dye as one nayled to a Crosse is, tho he be not yet dead. Yea this is by virtue of Christs death and your Communion with him therein, for that the Apostle aimes at, and hath his eye on in this expression that the Flesh
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000375_0018_0FA4FD2FC9C2BFB0"/>
is Crucified. The flesh being crucified it hath less power to stop and hinder the inward act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Grace, and its prevayling to Carry you on in the ways thereof. It was at first crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this end, and is kept Crucified upon the Cross of Christ under the hand of his Spirit and killing power of his death, for this end that you might walk in the Spirit being set at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the prevailing dominion and strength of it.</p>
            <p>Besides, If you be Christ's you have Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the flesh you yourselves have been active in it, applying the death of Christ to that end and fetching virtue from if for the killing of sin in your hearts. And therefore not walking in the Spirit, is a retracting what you have done in this kind, and an undoing of it lnasmuch as 'tis a yeilding and giving way to the flesh to live again and Act you again.</p>
            <p>Reas. 4. <hi>You are alive by the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have grace and that not from yourselves but from the Spirit. You have grace: This is given for Exercise: that is should be drawn forth, and fill your lives and all your actions <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. Grace unless exercised is so far lost: Its use lies in its being used, as it is of all other things. 'Tis below your priviledge and blessed estate not to <hi>walk in the Spirit;</hi> If others does not that are not alive in the Spirit
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000375_0019_0FA50261149A0C40"/>
'tis but like themselves, but for you 'tis unsuitable &amp; most incongrous. This Grace is from and by the Spirit, both first and still maintained. Thankfulness to him obligeth to walk in the Spirit, which is indeed to His praise and Glory.</p>
            <p>USE. 1. For Information.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Great part of a Christians work lyes out of other mens sight. </hi> Indeed the greatest part of it is bosome work: both his watch and his work ly cheifly there where No body else sees. His Exercises are most about such things, Especially the more grown Christian that he is. And he whose great business lyes without doors is either unsound or very low in growth, Even but a Babe in Christ and in Grace.</p>
            <p>Informat. 1. <hi>A true Christians life is not idle life but a busie one. </hi> Especially if a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian indeed; and in any measure serious and sensible: Yea when Grace is gotten and cleared too, that a man sees he hath it, and so his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumnce is setled, yet there he hath his hands full of work, even to see that he fill up his time with Dutyes, and his Dutyes with Grace; for both these are included is <hi>walking in the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inform. 3. <hi>A Christian should doe nothing wherein Grace cannot be exertised.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:000375_0020_0FA5026168608858"/>
For tis his indispensible duty to act Grace in every step of his Walk, therefore he may take no step wherein Grace cannot be exercised. This Rule if attended would afford Direction in many passages that fall before us in this World; Especially such Things as appear not flatly Evil in the Matter and Nature of them.</p>
            <p>If there be any thing wherein you cannot exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise grace, doe it not. True, the Rule holds not always affirmatively, that whatever a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain may Possibly exercise grace in, is therefore Lawful for him. A Godly <hi>Israclite</hi> might possibly Exercise Grace in being present at Sacrifices offered in the High places. <hi>Solomon</hi> if seems did so and therefore the Lord overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the failing and accepted his sincerity. And so (I doubt not) many souls have in keeping <hi>Holy-days</hi> of mens devising, and not of God's appointing or approving: And also in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping God after such modes and Forms as the Lord alloweth not: Especially in former dayes when less Light in these matters was broken out. But is follows not that these things are therefore Lawful because some have exercised Grace therein: Yea the rule holds Negatively, That wherein grace cannot be exercised in not lawful. It is in special useful in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: As for Example; In <hi>Attire</hi> and <hi>dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000375_0021_0FA502622ACCAA40"/>
If you cannot exercise grace in this and thus <hi>tricking up</hi> yourselves, or spending so much time in it, tis then unlawful for you. So in going into Company, and sitting with them, Especially in Publick houses, <hi>Taverns, Coffee houses</hi> &amp;c. Can you exercise grace in so doing? Canst put a respect of obedience to God, yea of love and Thankfulness on it? Canst thou maintain an Awe of him upon thy heart? or does it not rather ever bring a secret defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on thy spirit? If so, tis then unlawful for thee. And indeed, the Rule is general, and holds Concerning all Recreations, Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and universally all Indifferent things, If you cannot exercise grace in them, tho' through your own Infirmity, and much more if it be from the Nature or inseparable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the things themselves, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unlawful unto thee.</p>
            <p>USE. 2. For Examination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Have you walked in the Spirit?</hi> Yea, have you minded it in all the Steps of your walk? or onely minded your keeping your Way, and walking on without regarding whether in the Spirit or no, what grace you acted in every thing. Indeed it is not enough to act some grace in a duty, but you should fill up the duty with grace. <hi>e. g.</hi> Some dutyes are wider than others; a day of Humiliation than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

every day's prayer, &amp; therefore should have more of Godly Sorrow and holy fear act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it: Hence rending the heart <hi>Jocl.</hi> 2. 13. and calling Terrours round about us is the duty of such a day <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 22. to beset and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege our own souls therewith. So in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Faith</hi> should be acted at an higher rate than is always required in hearing the word, because there's a most solemn sealing Transaction between God and us: and because God in these deals with us by the most affecting senses. Hence they are wider Dutyes, &amp; hence require more enlarged actings of Faith. Examine whether you have acted Grace proportionably in all your dutyes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First-Table duties:</hi> Prayer, Hearing, keeping Sabbaths, receiving Sacraments: If no Grace be exercised in these, they have bin utterly lost, God's Name taken in vain, and hence they will never yeild thee any Comfort.</p>

Duties of Civility must have something worthy of God in them See <hi>Ruth.</hi> 2. 4. how their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations savour of God and Grace: verily this Rule extendeth even to these. Nay more, to Church Transactions, your debates and votes there and all your use of the liberty whereto the Lord hath called you, ought to be filled up with exercise of grace. And indeed it is the want of this, that makes Church-Members so often warp from the rule, and act the unsavory pangs and and distempers of their own spirits.</p>

            <p>Christ calls upon <hi>Sardis</hi> Rev. 3. 2, 3. because he had not found their works filled up with the Exercise of grace before God: Before men they seemed beautiful and glorious, but there was a secret emptiness and deadness in them before

the Lord. And for this he threatned them if they repented not to come on them as a Thief in the Night, in an hour when they knew not <hi>i. e.</hi> when they least looked for it, were least provided for, and in worst case to bear it, and with all Circumstances of Aggravation and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: This the Spirit sayth to the Church.</p>
            <p>There is no sin but we should be humbled for it when minded of it in the Word; much more such an one as this, which argues grace is very low and <hi>ready to die,</hi> as tis there sayd to <hi>Sardis</hi> And tis a sin of frequent Incursion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> a sin that we sin often every day, and therefore should be the more humbled for. Though we are apt to make light of such sins, yet the Spirit of God does not, Chirst doth not make light of it to that Church. Other sins that we seldom and hardly fall into, we think it our duty to humble our selves for: But this, and such as this doe us as much hurt, and usually more then such as affect us more with Sorrow and shame. If it seem to want any thing of weight and hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; yet the Frequency of it makes it up, and more then up. We must <hi>remember and loathe our selves for our doings that are not good,</hi> but empty of grace, as well as for those that are Abominations because or the Evil of the matter of them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 31.</p>
            <p>Consider two things to help to affect our
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000375_0025_0FA5026607524098"/>
hearts with shame and sorrow for not exercising grace in every step of our walk.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hereby we break with God and loose our Communion with him: Not our state of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion but the actual exercise and enjoyment of it. If a man should fourty or a 100 times every day loose the exercise of his Reason tho but for half a quarter of an hour or less, tho' he should not loose the Faculty it self, how sad would you account it! much more is this to be lamented, because hereby we loose our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, so far and so long as we do not <hi>walk in the Spirit:</hi> And Communion with him is as much more precious then the use of reason; as Divine &amp; spiritual life is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the life of Reason. In whatever we cease to exercise grace, we do therein turn off from God and break with him, and were it not for Christ and His Mediation we were Lost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whatever we do without Exercising grace in it, savours not to God's tast it finds no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. unless the spices of our graces flow out, none of our fruit is pleasant to Christ's Tast, and if not pleasant to his tast he Presents it not to God for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: Hence nothing wherein no grace is Exercised is put on our account for a reward, but only amongst our sins for pardon or for punishment: he<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> if no grace be exercised, our
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000375_0026_0FA50266B8942180"/>
Salvation is not at all furthered thereby. And how sad is it for a man that hath a Race to run, and work of life and death to get done; to Nod, and stand, and sleep, and fall so often in a day!</p>
            <p>USE. 4. of Exhortation,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walk in the Spirit, exercise grace in every Step you take.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look to it, not only that you doe what is good, but also that in doing of it you act the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of Grace that you have recieved.</p>
            <p>Here Consider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You have acted Corruption in all your ways,</hi> Col. 3. 2. Let the time past suffice us, <hi>1. Pet,</hi> 4. and from very shame and indignation at your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs for you acting of Corruption, be provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to walk in the Spirit for the time to come: For you are much indebted to Christ, you have had much forgiven and therefore should love much.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You must unavoidably in every thing, act Grace or Corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore if you act not Grace, you will act Corruption. These two are the Universal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all our Actions, and doe Flow into every thing we doe: They are seated so near together, and are so Contrary one to the other, perpetually warring each against other, that if one give back never so little, the other will be sure immediately to come on, And
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000375_0027_0FA502676EADD440"/>
And indeed these two contrary principles shall and must lodge in the same soul, yea abide in the very same faculty during this life but the Conquest of the one over the other lyes in the ones prevayling more then the other to fill up your Actings. These two, flesh and Spirit, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Grace, divide between them all our Actions whatever, there being no <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> any more then there is any Action that hath no Rule or Law over it: As there will be either light or darkness in the Air; So there will be either Sin or Grace, Flesh or Spirit filling every Action that is humane, that falls under the Command of the Will.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By the</hi> Exercise of Grace <hi>the soul is kept in an Holy Healthfull and Chearfull frame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lusts warr against the soul, <hi>1. Pet.</hi> 2. 11. and thence the prevayling of them tends to the death of the soul. Grace warrs for the soul, and the acting thereof is the souls strength and health and life. Act grace in one passage, and you will come off from it with the heart in frame and fitted by it for another. Grace acted in our Callings, sits the heart for dutyes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and in dutyes of worship fits the heart for the dutyes of our Calling: Yea, by this meanes the heart will be kept fitt for every Change and cannot be found unprepared. <hi>Lamps burning,</hi> and <hi>Loyns girt</hi> is nothing else but grace in actual exercise: This also puts and keeps the soul in a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000375_0028_0FA502684D3CD310"/>
cheerful and comfortable frame. There is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and sweetness in the exercise of any grace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Comfort in love.</hi> For in the exercise of grace the soul draws near to God, and hath Fellowship with him who is the Fountain of bliss and Comfort. And hence 'tis that your dutyes and wayes are so empty of Comfort, yea indeed nothing but secret bitterness in reflecting on them, because there is no grace exercised in them. Thus 'tis with us in our walking and Callings, we come off from them with a secret sting or trouble on our consciences, tis because grace was not exercised in them. And thus tis in the most sweet and Comfortable dutyes, Receiving the Sacrament, praising God &amp;c. if Grace is not Exercised in them, if they are not performed <hi>in the Spirit</hi> they yeild no Comfort neither afterwards, neither are they sweet in the doing. On the other hand, Duties that seem to be bitter in their proper Nature, <hi>e. g.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and breaking the heart for sin, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing it before God, and Condemning a mans self for it, even these duties are most sweet, and yeild unspeakable comfort if done <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> if grace be exercised in them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Thus exercising Grace will sublimate and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallize every action, turning natural affections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus a mans loving his Wife or Child, or any other Relation or friend, become gracious acts,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000375_0029_0FA50268E456C7B8"/>
and his eating and drinking acts of obedience, and hence are of great account in the eyes of God, Thus, not the meanest smallest act, but it hath a glory and excellency in it if grace be exercised: as <hi>Luther</hi> said, <hi>a poor milk-maid milking, if done in Faith is more glorious then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Conquests &amp; Triumphs of Caesar or Alexander:</hi> And it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear so another day, being recorded and regis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in Heaven for a gracious Acceptance and reward in the day of Christ. Thus a man's eating, drinking, sleeping promotes his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and adds something to his Crown of Glory another day; as well as his Praying, or his Hearing, or his Suffering for CHRIST.</p>
