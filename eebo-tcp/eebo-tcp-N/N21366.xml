            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE following Sermons contain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what I have been preaching, for between eight and nine years laſt paſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> During that time I have frequently ſpoken in publick, on every ſubject in the enſuing collection: And I am not conſcious, that there is any one point of doctrine, on which I am accuſtomed to ſpeak in public, which is not here, incidentally, if not profeſſedly laid before every Chriſtian Reader. Every ſerious man, who peruſes theſe will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee in the cleareſt manner, what thoſe doctrines are which I embrace and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> the eſſentials of true religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:028060_0004_0FD689CB4F7A14F8"/>
2. But I am thoroughly ſenſible, theſe are not propoſed, in ſuch a manner as ſome may expect. Nothing here appears in an elaborate, elegant, or oratorical dreſs. If it had been my deſire or deſign to write thus, my leiſure would not permit. But in truth I at preſent deſigned nothing leſs; for I now write (as I generally ſpeak) <hi>ad populum:</hi> To the bulk of mankind, to thoſe who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reliſh nor underſtand the art of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But who notwithſtanding are compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judges of thoſe truths, which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to preſent and future happineſs. I mention this, that curious readers may ſpare themſelves the labour of ſeeking for what they will not find.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I deſign plain truth for plain people. Therefore of ſet purpoſe I abſtain from all nice and philoſophical ſpeculations, from all perplext and intricate reaſonings; and as far as poſſible, from even the ſhew of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs in ſometimes citing the original ſcriptures. I labour to avoid all words which are not eaſy to be underſtood, all which are not uſed in common life: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd in particular, thoſe kind of technical terms, that ſo frequently occur in bodies of divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thoſe modes of ſpeaking which men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> reading are intimately acquainted with, but which to common people are an unknown
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:028060_0005_0FD689CE0291B700"/>tongue. Yet I am not aſſured, that I do not ſometimes ſlide into them unawares: It is ſo extremely natural to imagine, that a word which is familiar to ourſelves, is ſo to all the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nay, my deſign is, in ſome ſenſe to forget all that ever I have read in my life. I mean to ſpeak, in the general, as if I had never read one author, antient or modern (always excepting the inſpired.) I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that on the one hand, this may be a means of enabling me more clearly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſentiments of my heart, while I ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply follow the chain of my own thoughts, without entangling myſelf with thoſe of other men: And that, on the other, I ſhall come with fewer weights upon my mind, with leſs of prejudice and prepoſſeſſion, either to ſearch for myſelf, or to deliver to others, the naked truths of the goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To candid, reaſonable m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> I am not afraid to lay open what have been the inmoſt thoughts of my heart. I have thought, "I am a creature of a day, paſſing thro' life, as an arrow through the air. I am a Spirit, come from GOD, and returning to GOD: Juſt hovering over the Great Gulph; till a few moments hence, I am no more ſeen: I drop into an unchangeable eternity! I want
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028060_0006_0FD689D5F0394A88"/>to know one thing, the way to Heaven: How to land ſafe on that happy ſhore. GOD himſelf has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ondeſcended to teach the way; for this very end he came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. He hath written it down in a book. O give me that book! At any price give me the book of GOD! I have it; Here is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enough for me. Let me be <hi>Homo unius libri.</hi> Here then I am, far from the buſy ways of men. I ſit down alone: Only GOD is here. In his preſence I open, I read his book; for this end, to find the way to Heaven. Is there a doubt concerning the meaning of what I read? Does any thing appear dark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> intricate? I lift up my heart to the Father of lights. "Lord, is it not thy word, <hi>If any man lack wiſdom, let him aſk of</hi> GOD? Thou <hi>giveſt liberally and upbraideſt not;</hi> Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>If any be willing to do thy will, he ſhall know.</hi> I am willing to do. Let me know thy will." I then ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and conſider parallel paſſages of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>comparing Spiritual things with Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual.</hi> I meditate thereon, with all the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and earneſtneſs of which my mind is capable. If any doubt ſtill remain, I conſult thoſe who are experienced in the things of GOD: And then, the writings whereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, they yet ſpeak. And what I thus learn, that I teach.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="v" facs="unknown:028060_0007_0FD689DAC7420840"/>
6. I have accordingly ſet down in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sermons, what I find in the bible concerning the way to Heaven; with a view to diſtinguiſh this way of GOD, from all thoſe which are the inventions of men. I have endeavoured to deſcribe the true, the ſcriptural, experimental religion, ſo as to omit nothing which is a real part thereof, and to add nothing thereto which is not. And herein it is more eſpecially my deſire, firſt, to guard thoſe who are juſt ſetting their faces toward Heaven, (and who having lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquaintance with the things of GOD, are the more liable to be turned out of the way) from formality, from me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> outſide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which has almoſt driven heart-reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of the world: And ſecondly, To warn thoſe who know the religion of the heart, the faith which worketh by love, left at any time they make void the law thro' faith, and ſo fall back into the ſnare of the Devil.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. By the advice and at the requeſt of ſome of my friends, I have prefixt to the other ſermons contained in this volume, three ſermons of my own and one of my Brother's, preached before the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford.</hi> My deſign requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed ſome diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on thoſe heads. And I preferred theſe before any others, as being a ſtronger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:028060_0008_0FD689DDA8CBCD48"/>than any which can be drawn up now, to thoſe who have frequently aſſerted,— "That we have changed our doctrine of late, and do not preach now, what we did ſome years ago." Any man of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may now judge for himſelf, when he has compared the latter with the former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. But ſome may ſay, I have miſtaken the way myſelf, altho' I take upon me to teach it to others. It is poſſible, many will think this, and it is very probable, that I have. But I truſt, whereinſover I have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, my mind is open to conviction. I ſincerely deſire to be better informed. I ſay to GOD and man, "What I know not, teach thou me!"</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Are you perſuaded, you ſee more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than me? It is not unlikely that you may. Then, treat me, as you would deſire to be treated yourſelf upon a change of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Point me out a better way than I have yet known. Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> me it is ſo, by plain proof of ſcripture. And if I linger in the path I have been accuſtomed to tread, and therefore unwilling to leave, labour with me a little, take me by the hand, and lead me as I am able to bear. But be not diſpleaſed if I entreat you, not to beat me down, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to quicken my pace: I can go but feebly and ſlowly at beſt; then, I ſhould not be
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:028060_0009_0FD689DF1A9A6108"/>able to go at all. May I not requeſt of you further, not to give me hard names, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring me into the right way? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I was ever ſo much in the wrong. I doubt this would not ſet me right. Rather, it would make me run ſo much the farther from you, and ſo get more and more out of the way.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Nay, perhaps, if you are angry, ſo ſhall I be too; and then there will be ſmall hopes of finding the truth. If once anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> (as <hi>Homer</hi> ſomewhere expreſſes it) this ſmoke will ſo dim the eyes of my ſoul, that I ſhall be able to ſee nothing clearly. For GOD'S ſake, if it be poſſible to avoid it, let us not provoke one another to wrath. Let us not kindle in each other this fire of Hell; much leſs, blow it up into a flame. If we could diſcern truth by that dreadful light, would it not be loſs, rather than gain? For how far is love, even with many wrong opinions, to be preferred before truth itſelf without love? We may die without the knowledge of many truths, and yet be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom. But if we die without love, what will knowledge avail? Juſt as much as it avails the Devil and his Angels!</p>

ALL the Bleſſings which GOD hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Man are of his mere Grace, Bounty or Favour: His Free, undeſerved Favour; Favour altogether undeſerved; Man having no claim to the leaſt of his Mercies. It was free Grace that <hi>formed Man of the Duſt of the Ground, and breathed into him a living Soul,</hi> and ſtamped on that Soul the Image of GOD, and <hi>put all Things under his Feet.</hi> The ſame Free Grace continues to us at this Day, Life and Breath, and all Things. For there is nothing we are, or have, or do, which can deſerve the leaſt Thing at GOD'S Hand. <hi>All our Works thou, O</hi> GOD, <hi>haſt wrought in us.</hi> Theſe, therefore, are ſo many more Inſtances of Free Mercy: And whatever Righteouſneſs may be found in Man, this is alſo the Gift of GOD.</p>

                  <p>Now, that we fall not ſhort of the Grace of GOD, it concerns us carefully to enquire,

                  <list>
                     <item>1. And firſt, It is not barely the Faith of a Heathen. Now GOD requireth of a Heathen to believe, <hi>That</hi> GOD <hi>is; that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him:</hi> and that he is to be ſought by <hi>glorifying him as</hi> GOD, <hi>by giving him Thanks</hi> for all Things; and by a careful Practice of Moral Virtue, of Juſtice, Mercy and Truth toward their Fellow Creatures.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028060_0014_0FD689EEE27EAC58"/>of Reward and Puniſhment, and the obligatory Nature of Moral Virtue. For this is barely the Faith of a Heathen.</item>
                     <item>2. Nor, 2dly, Is it the Faith of a Devil, tho' this goes much farther than that of a Heathen. For the Devil believes, not only, that there is a wiſe and powerful GOD, Gracious to reward, and Juſt to puniſh, but alſo, that JESUS is the Son of GOD, the CHRIST, the SAVIOUR of the World. So we find him declaring, in expreſs Terms, <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 34. <hi>I know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy One of</hi> GOD. Nor can we doubt but that unhappy Spirit believes all thoſe Words, which came out of the Mouth of the Holy One; yea, and whatſoever elſe was written by thoſe Holy Men of old; of two of whom he was compelled to give that glorious Teſtimony, <hi>Theſe men are the Servants of the moſt high</hi> GOD, <hi>who ſhew unto you the Way of Salvation.</hi> Thus much then the great Enemy of GOD and Man believes, and trembles in believing, That GOD <hi>was made manifeſt in the Fleſh;</hi> That he will <hi>tread all Enemies under his Feet,</hi> and that <hi>all Scripture was given by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of</hi> GOD. Thus far goeth the Faith of a Devil.</item>
                     <item>3 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Faith through which we are ſaved, in that Senſe of the Word which will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be explained, is not barely that which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves had while CHRIST was yet upon Earth; tho' they ſo believed on him as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>leave all and follow him;</hi> altho' they had then Power to work Miracles, to <hi>heal all manner of Sickneſs, and all Manner of Diſeaſe;</hi> yea, they had then <hi>Power and Authority over all Devils:</hi> And which is beyond all this, were ſent by their Maſter to <hi>preach the Kingdom of</hi> GOD.</item>

4. What Faith is it then through which we are ſaved? It may be anſwered, firſt, in general, It is a Faith in CHRIST; CHRIST, and GOD through CHRIST, are the proper Object of it. Herein therefore, it is ſufficiently, abſolutely, diſtinguiſhed from the Faith either of ancient or modern Heathens. And from the Faith of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, it is fully diſtinguiſhed by this, It is not barely a Speculative, Rational Thing, a cold, lifeleſs Aſſent, a Train of Ideas in the Head; but alſo a Diſpoſition of the Heart. For thus ſaith the Scripture, <hi>With the Heart, Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs.</hi> And, <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe with thy</hi> Heart, <hi>that</hi> GOD <hi>hath raiſed Him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. And herein does it differ from that Faith which the Apoſtles themſelves had while our Lord was on Earth, that it acknowledges the Neceſſity and Merit of his Death, and the Power of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. It acknowledges his death as the only ſufficient Means of redeeming Man from Death Eternal; and his Reſurrection as the Reſtoration of us all to Life and Immortality: Inaſmuch as <hi>he was delivered for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification.</hi> Chriſtian Faith is then, not only an Aſſent to the whole Goſpel of CHRIST, but alſo a full Reliance on the Blood of CHRIST, a Truſt in the Merits of his Life, Death, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; a Recumbency upon him as our atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and our Life; <hi>as given for us,</hi> and <hi>living in us.</hi> It is a ſure Confidence which a Man hath in GOD, that through the Merits of CHRIST, <hi>his</hi> Sins are forgiven, and <hi>he</hi> reconciled to the Favour of GOD; and in conſequence hereof, a cloſing with him, and cleaving to him, as <hi>our Wiſdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="15" facs="unknown:028060_0016_0FD689F4F1398448"/>Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, Redemption,</hi> or in one Word our <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="2">II. What Salvation it is, which is through this Faith, is the ſecond Thing to be conſidered.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. And firſt, Whatſoever elſe it imply, it is a Preſent Salvation. It is ſomething attainable, yea, actually attained on Earth, by thoſe who are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Faith. For thus ſaith the Apoſtle to the Believers at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and in them to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of all Ages, not Ye ſhall be (tho' that alſo is true) but <hi>ye</hi> are <hi>ſaved through Faith.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Ye are ſaved</hi> (to comprize all in one Word) from Sin. This is the Salvation which is through Faith. This is that great Salvation foretold by the Angel, before GOD brought his firſt begotten into the World, <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name</hi> JESUS, <hi>for he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> And neither here, nor in other Parts of Holy Writ, is there any Limitation or Reſtriction. All his People, or, as it is elſewhere expreſſed, all that believe in him, he will ſave from all their Sins; from Original and Actual, Paſt and Preſent Sin, of the Fleſh and of the Spirit. Through Faith that is in him, they are ſaved both from the Guilt and from the Power of it.</item>
                     <item>3. Firſt from the Guilt of all Paſt Sin. For whereas <hi>all the World is guilty before</hi> GOD; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſhould he <hi>be extreme to mark what is done amiſs, there is none that could abide it:</hi> And whereas <hi>by the Law is only the Knowledge of Sin,</hi> but no Deliverance from it; ſo that <hi>by fulfilling the Deeds of the Law, no Fleſh can be juſtified in his Sight: Now the Righteouſneſs of</hi> GOD, <hi>which is by Faith of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>is manifeſted unto all that believe.</hi> Now <hi>they are juſtified freely by
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028060_0017_0FD689F4F7499080"/>his Grace, through the Redemption that is in</hi> JESUS CHRIST. <hi>Him</hi> GOD <hi>hath ſet forth to be a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation through Faith in his Blood; To declare his Righteouſneſs for</hi> (or by) <hi>the Remiſſion of the Sins that are paſt.</hi> Now hath CHRIST <hi>taken away the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> He hath <hi>blotted out the Hand-writing that was againſt us, taking it out of the Way, nailing it to his Croſs. There is therefore no Condemnation now, to them which</hi> believe <hi>in</hi> CHRIST JESUS.</item>
                     <item>4. And being ſaved from Guilt, they are ſaved from Fear. Not indeed from a filial Fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, but from all ſervile Fear, from that <hi>Fear which hath Torment,</hi> from Fear of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from Fear of the Wrath of GOD; whom they now no longer regard as a ſevere Maſter, but as an indulgent Father. <hi>They have not received again the Spirit of Bondage; but the Spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby they cry, Abba, Father: The Spirit it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo bearing Witneſs with their Spirits, that they are the Children of</hi> GOD. They are alſo ſaved from the Fear, tho' not from the Poſſibility, of falling away from the Grace of GOD, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort of the great and precious Promiſes: They are <hi>ſealed with the Holy Spirit of Promiſe, which is the Earneſt of their Inheritance.</hi> (Eph. i. 13.) Thus have they <hi>Peace with</hi> GOD <hi>through our Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST. <hi>They rejoice in Hope of the Glory of</hi> GOD. <hi>And the love of</hi> GOD <hi>is ſhed abroad in their Hearts, through the Holy Ghoſt, which is given unto them.</hi> And hereby they are <hi>perſuaded</hi> (tho' perhaps not all at all Times, nor with the ſame Fulneſs of Perſuaſion) that <hi>neither Death nor Life, nor Things preſent, nor Things to come, nor Heighth nor Depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate them from
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028060_0018_0FD689F659B7B5B0"/>the Love of</hi> GOD <hi>which is in</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>our Lord.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. Again, through this Faith they are ſaved from the Power of Sin, as well as from the Guilt of it. So the Apoſtle declares. <hi>Ye know that he was manifeſted to take away our Sins, and in him is no Sin. Whoſoever abideth in him ſinneth not.</hi> (Chap. iii. 5, &amp;c.) Again, <hi>Little Children, let no Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you.—He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.— Whoſoever believeth is born of</hi> GOD. <hi>And whoſoever is born of</hi> GOD <hi>doth not commit Sin, for his Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him: And he cannot Sin, becauſe he is born of</hi> GOD. Once more, <hi>We know that Whatſoever is born of</hi> God <hi>ſinneth not: But he that is begotten of</hi> God, <hi>keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not,</hi> Chap. v. 18.</item>
                     <item>6. He that is by Faith born of God, ſinneth not,
<list>
                           <item>1. By any habitual Sin: For all habitual Sin, is Sin reigning. But Sin cannot reign in any that believeth. Nor,</item>
                           <item>2. By any wilful Sin, for his Will, while he abideth in the Faith is utterly ſet againſt all Sin, and abhorreth it as deadly Poiſon. Nor,</item>
                           <item>3. By any ſinful Deſire; for he continually deſireth the Holy and Perfect Will of God; and any Tendency to an Unholy Deſire, he by the Grace of God, ſtifleth in the Birth. Nor,</item>
                           <item>4, Doth he ſin by Infirmities, whether in Act, Word, or Thought. For his Infirmities have no Concurrence of his Will; and without This they are not properly Sins. Thus, <hi>He that is born of</hi> God <hi>doth not commit Sin.</hi> And tho' he cannot ſay, <hi>He hath not ſinned,</hi> yet now, <hi>he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>7. This then is the Salvation which is through Faith, even in the preſent World: A Salvation from Sin, and the Conſequences of Sin, both often expreſſed in the Word <hi>Juſtification;</hi> which, taken
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028060_0019_0FD689F7DF9A8BB0"/>in the largeſt Senſe, implies, A Deliverance from Guilt and Puniſhment, by the Atonement of CHRIST actually applied to the Soul of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner now believing on him, and a Deliverance from the whole Body of Sin through CHRIST <hi>formed in his Heart.</hi> So that he who is thus juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or ſaved by Faith, is indeed <hi>born again.</hi> He is <hi>born again of the Spirit</hi> unto a new <hi>Life, which is hid with Chriſt in</hi> God. <hi>He is a new Creature: Old Things are paſt away: All Things in him are become new.</hi> And as a <hi>new-born Babe he gladly receives the</hi>

                        <hi>ſincere Milk of the Word, and grows thereby: Going on in the Might of the Lord his</hi> God, <hi>from Faith to Faith, from Grace to Grace, until at Length he come unto a perfect Man, unto the Meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p n="3">III. The firſt uſual Objection to this is,
<list>
                        <item>1. That to preach Salvation or Juſtification by Faith only, is to preach againſt Holineſs and Good Works. To which a ſhort Anſwer might be given: It would be ſo, if we ſpake, as ſome do, of a Faith which was ſeparate from theſe. But we ſpeak of a Faith which is not ſo, but neceſſarily productive of all Good Works and all Holineſs.</item>
                        <item>2. But it may be of uſe to conſider it more at large: Eſpecially ſince it is no new Objection, but as old as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Time; for even then it was aſked, <hi>Do we not make void the Law through Faith?</hi> We anſwer, firſt, All who preach not Faith, do manifeſtly make void the Law; either directly and groſly by Limitations and Comments, that eat out all the Spirit of the Text: Or indirectly, by not pointing out the only Means whereby it is poſſible to perform it. Whereas, ſecondly, <hi>We eſtabliſh
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028060_0020_0FD689F95AD4D9C8"/>the Law;</hi> both by ſhewing its full Extent, and Spiritual Meaning: And by calling all to that living Way, whereby <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the Law may be fulfilled in them.</hi> Theſe, while they truſt in the Blood of CHRIST alone, uſe all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which he hath appointed, do all the <hi>Good Works which he had before prepared that they ſhould walk therein,</hi> and enjoy and manifeſt all holy and heavenly Tempers, even the ſame <hi>Mind that was in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus.</item>
                        <item>3. But does not preaching this Faith lead Men into Pride? We anſwer, Accidentally it may. Therefore ought every Believer to be earneſtly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, (in the Words of the Great Apoſtle) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Unbelief, the firſt Branches were broken off; and thou ſtandeſt by Faith. Be not high minded, but fear. If</hi> God <hi>ſpared not the Natural Branches, take heed leſt he ſpare not Thee. Behold, therefore, the Goodneſs and Severity of</hi> God! <hi>On them which fell, Severity: But towards thee, Goodneſs: If thou continue in his Goodneſs; otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> And while he continues therein, he will remember thoſe Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and anſwering this very Objection, (<hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 27) <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay; but by the Law of Faith.</hi> If a Man were juſtified by his Works, he would have whereof to glory. But there is no glorying for him, <hi>that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the Ungodly,</hi> (Rom. iv.) To the ſame Effect, are the Words both preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and following the Text, (<hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 4, &amp;c.) God, <hi>who is rich in Mercy,—even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickened us together with</hi> Chriſt, <hi>(by Grace ye are ſaved) — that he might ſlew the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028060_0021_0FD689FADD0B2670"/>towards us through</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>For by Grace ye are ſaved through Faith. And that not of yourſelves.</hi> Of yourſelves cometh neither your Faith nor your Salvation. <hi>It is the Gift of</hi> God; the free, undeſerved Gift, the Faith thro' which ye are ſaved, as well as the Salvation, which he of his own good Pleaſure, his mere Favour, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexes thereto. That ye believe, is one Inſtance of his Grace; that believing ye are ſaved, another. <hi>Not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt.</hi> For all our Works, all our Righteouſneſs, which were before our Believing, merited nothing of God but Condemnation. So far were they from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Faith; which therefore, whenever given, is not <hi>of Works.</hi> Neither is Salvation of the Works we do when we believe. For <hi>it is</hi> then God <hi>that worketh in us.</hi> And therefore, that he giveth us a Reward for what he himſelf worketh, only commendeth the Riches of his Mercy, but leaveth us nothing whereof to glory.</item>

Indeed it may and will; many <hi>will continue in Sin that Grace may abound.</hi> But their Blood is upon their own Head. The Goodneſs of God ought to lead them to Repentance, and ſo it will thoſe who are ſincere of Heart. When they know there is yet Forgiveneſs with him, they will cry aloud that he would blot out their Sins alſo, thro' Faith which is in Jeſus. And if they earneſtly cry, and faint not, if they ſeek him in all the Means he hath appointed, if they refuſe to be comforted till he come, <hi>he will come and will not tarry.</hi> And he can do much Work in a ſhort Time. Many are the Examples in the Acts of the Apoſtles, of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028060_0022_0FD68A029F0EE998"/>God's ſhedding abroad this Faith in Men's Hearts, even like Lightning falling from Heaven.

And ſo it ought; for none can truſt in the Merits of Chriſt, till he has utterly renounced his own. He that <hi>goeth about to eſtabliſh his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive the Righteouſneſs of God.

                  <p n="1">I.) 1. Now, in the being <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian</hi> is implied, firſt Heathen Honeſty. No one, I ſuppoſe, will make any Queſtion of this; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſince by Heathen Honeſty here, I mean, not that which is recommended in the Writings of their Philoſophers only, but ſuch as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Heathens expected of one another, and many of them actually practiſed. By the Rules of this they were taught, that they ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; not to take away their Neighbour's Goods, either by Robbery or Theft: Not to oppreſs the Poor, neither to uſe Extortion toward any: Not to cheat or over-reach either the Poor or Rich, in whatſoever Commerce they had with them:
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028060_0029_0FD68A0DDB80CD50"/>To defraud no Man of his Right, and, if it were poſſible to owe no Man any Thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, the common Heathens allowed, that ſome Regard was to be paid to Truth as well as to Juſtice. And accordingly, they not only held him in Abomination, who was forſworn, who called God to witneſs to a Lie; but him alſo, who was known to be a Slanderer of his Neighbour, who falſely accuſed any Man. And indeed little better did they eſteem wilful Liars of any Sort, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting them the Diſgrace of Human Kind, and the Peſts of Society.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet again, there was a Sort of Love and Aſſiſtance, which they expected one from another. They expected whatever aſſiſtance any one could give another, without Prejudice to himſelf. And this they extended, not only to thoſe little Offices of Humanity, which are performed without any Expenſe or Labour; but likewiſe, to the Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hungry, if they had Food to ſpare, the clothing the Naked, with their own ſuperfluous Raiment; and in general, the giving to any that needed, ſuch Things as they needed not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thus far (in the loweſt Account of it) Heathen Honeſty went, the firſt Thing implied in the being <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II.) 4. A ſecond Thing implied in the being <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian,</hi> is the having a Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, of that Godlineſs which is preſcribed in the Goſpel of Chriſt: The having the <hi>Outſide of a real Chriſtian.</hi> Accordingly, the <hi>Almoſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> does nothing which the Goſpel forbids.

He not only avoids all actual Adultery, Fornication, and Uncleanneſs, but every Word or Look, that either directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly tends thereto: Nay, and all idle Words, abſtaining both from all Detraction, Backbiting, Tale bearing, Evil ſpeaking, and from <hi>all fooliſh Talking and Jeſting,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a kind of Virtue in the Heathen Moraliſt's Account. Briefly from all Converſation that is not <hi>good to the Uſe of edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that conſequently <hi>grieves the Holy Spirit of</hi> God, <hi>whereby we are ſealed to the Day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. He abſtains from <hi>Wine wherein is Exceſs,</hi> from Revelling and Gluttony. He avoids, as much as in him lies, all Strife and Contention, continually endeavouring to live peaceably with all Men. And if he ſuffer wrong, he avengeth not himſelf, neither returns Evil for Evil. He is no Railer, no Brawler, no Scoffer, either at the Faults or Infirmities of his Neighbour. He does not willingly wrong, hurt, or grieve any Man; but in all Things acts and ſpeaks by that plain Rule, <hi>Whatſoever thou wouldſt not be ſhould do unto thee, that do not thou to another.</hi>

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028060_0031_0FD68A10EEED0020"/>Wicked, inſtructs the Ignorant, confirms the Wavering, quickens the Good, and comforts the Afflicted. He labours to awaken thoſe that ſleep, to lead thoſe whom God hath already awakened, to the Fountain opened for Sin and for Uncleanneſs, that they may waſh therein and be clean; and to ſtir up thoſe who are ſaved through Faith, to adorn the Goſpel of Chriſt in all Things.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He that hath the Form of Godlineſs, uſes alſo the Means of Grace, yea, all of them, and at all Opportunities. He conſtantly frequents the Houſe of God; and that not as the Manner of ſome is, who come into the Preſence of the Moſt High, either loaded with Gold and coſtly Apparel, or in all the gaudy Vanity of Dreſs; and either by their unſeaſonable Civilities to each other, or the impertinent Gaiety of their Behaviour, diſclaim all Pretenſions to the Form, as well as to the Power of Godlineſs. Would to God there were none even among ourſelves who fall under the ſame Condemnation: Who come into his Houſe, it may be, gazing about, or with all the Signs of the moſt liſtleſs, careleſs Indifference, tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they may <hi>ſeem</hi> to uſe a Prayer to God for his Bleſſing on what they are entering upon; who during that awful Service, are either aſleep or reclined in the moſt convenient Poſture for it; or, as tho' they ſuppoſed God was aſleep, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one another, or looking round, as utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void of Employment. Neither let theſe be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of the Form of Godlineſs. No; he who has even this, behaves with Seriouſneſs and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in every Part of that ſolemn Service. More eſpecially when he approaches the Table of the Lord, it is not with a light or careleſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. To this if we add, the conſtant Uſe of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Prayer, by thoſe who are Maſters of Families, and the ſetting Times apart for private Addreſſes to God, with a daily Seriouſneſs of Behaviour: He who uniformly practiſes this Outward Religion, has the Form of Godlineſs. There needs but One Thing more in order to his being <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian,</hi> and that is, Sincerity.</p>
                  <p n="3">III.) 9. By Sincerity, I mean, a real, inward Principle of Religion, from whence theſe outward Actions flow. And indeed, if we have not this, we have not Heathen Honeſty; no, not ſo much of it as will anſwer the demand of a <hi>Heathen, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean Poet.</hi> Even this poor Wretch, in his ſober Intervals, is able to teſtify,

                  <p n="1">I.) 1. Firſt, The Love of God. For thus ſaith his Word, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy</hi> God, <hi>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength:</hi> Such a Love of God is this, as engroſſes the whole Heart, as takes up all the Affections, as fills the entire Capacity of the Soul, and employs the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Extent of all its Faculties. He that thus loves the Lord his God, his Spirit continually <hi>rejoiceth in</hi> God <hi>his Saviour.</hi> His <hi>Delight</hi> in <hi>in the Lord, his</hi> Lord and his All, to whom <hi>in every Thing he giveth Thanks. All</hi> his <hi>Deſire is unto</hi> God, <hi>and the Remembrance of his Name.</hi> His Heart is ever crying out, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſide Thee.</hi> Indeed, what can he deſire beſide God? Not the World, or the Things of the World. For he is <hi>crucified to the World, and the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028060_0035_0FD68A1C996CD9A0"/>World crucified to him.</hi> He is crucified to the Deſire of the Fleſh, the Deſire of the Eye, and the Pride of Life. Yea, he is dead to Pride of every Kind: For <hi>Love is not puffed up;</hi> but he that dwelleth in Love <hi>dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> is leſs than nothing in his own Eyes.</p>
                  <p n="2">II.) 2. The Second Thing implied in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>altogether a Chriſtian</hi> is, The Love of our Neighbour. For thus ſaid our Lord in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> If any Man aſk who is my Neighbour, we reply, Every Man in the World; every Child of his, who is <hi>the Father of the Spirits of all Fleſh.</hi> Nor may we in any wiſe except our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or the Enemies of God and their own Souls. But every Chriſtian loveth theſe alſo as himſelf, yea, <hi>as Chriſt loved us.</hi> He that would more fully underſtand what Manner of Love this is, may conſider St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Deſcription of it. It is, <hi>long ſuffering and kind. It envieth not. It is not raſh or haſty in judging. It is not puffed up,</hi> but maketh him that loves, the leaſt, the Servant of all. Love <hi>doth not behave itſelf unſeemly,</hi> but <hi>becometh all Things to all Men.</hi> She <hi>ſeeketh not her own,</hi> but only the Good of others, that they may be ſaved. Love <hi>is not provoked.</hi> It caſteth out Wrath, which he who hath, is not <hi>made perfect in Laws.</hi> It <hi>thinketh no Evil.</hi> It <hi>rejoiceth not in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but rejoiceth in the Truth.</hi> It <hi>cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">III. 3. There is yet one Thing more that may be ſeparately conſidered, tho' it cannot actually be ſeparate from the preceding, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the being <hi>altogether a Chriſtian.</hi> And
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028060_0036_0FD68A1E56FE17D8"/>that is the Ground of All, even Faith. V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Things are ſpoken of this throughout the Oracles of God. <hi>Every one,</hi> ſaith the beloved Diſciple, <hi>that believeth, is born of</hi> God. <hi>To as many us received him, gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> And, <hi>this is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith.</hi> Yea, our Lord himſelf declares, <hi>He that believeth in the Son hath everlaſting Life; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not into Condemnation, but is paſſed from Death unto Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But here let no Man deceive his own Soul. "<note n="*" place="bottom">Homily on the Salvation of Man.</note> It is diligently to be noted, the Faith which bringeth not forth Repentance and Love, and all good Works, is not that right living Faith which is here ſpoken of, but a dead and deviliſh one. For even the Devils believe that Chriſt was born of a Virgin, that he wrought all kinds of Miracles, declaring himſelf very God: That for our Sakes he ſuffered a moſt painful Death, to redeem us from Death everlaſting: That he roſe again the third Day; that he aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſitteth at the Right Hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at the End of the World, ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to judge both the Quick and Dead. Theſe Articles of our Faith the Devils believe, and ſo they believe all that is written in the Old and New Teſtament. And yet for all this Faith, they be but Devils.

                  <p n="6">6.

                     </gap> was inwardly and outwardly ſinleſs and undefiled. He

                     <hi>loved the Lord his God with all his Heart, and with all his Mind and Soul and Strength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Man thus upright and perfect, God give a perfect Law, to which he required full and perfect Obedience. He required full Obedience in every Point, and this to be performed without any Intermiſſion, from the Moment Man became a living Soul, till the Time of his Trial ſhould be ended. No Allowance was made for any fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort. As indeed there was no need of any; Man being altogether equal to the Taſk aſſigned, and thoroughly furniſhed for every good Word and Work.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To the entire Law of Love which was written in his Heart (againſt which perhaps he could not ſin directly) it ſeemed good to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Wiſdom of God, to ſuperadd one poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law: <hi>Thou ſhalt not eat of the Fruit of the Tree that groweth in the midſt of the Garden:</hi> Annexing that Penalty thereto, <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such then was the State of Man in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. By the free, unmerited Love of God, he was holy and happy; he knew, loved, enjoyed God, which is (in Subſtance) Life everlaſting. And in this Life of Love, he was to continue for ever, if he continued to obey God in all Things: But if he diſobeyed in any, he was to forfeit all. <hi>In that Day,</hi> ſaid God, <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Man did diſobey God. He <hi>ate of the Tree, of which God commanded him, ſaying, Thou ſhalt not eat of it.</hi> And in that Day he was condemned, by the righteous Judgment of God. Then alſo the Sentence whereof he was
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028060_0089_0FD68AAAF6EB76A8"/>warned before, began to take Place upon him. For the Moment he taſted that Fruit, he died: His Soul died, was ſeparated from God; ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from whom the Soul has no more Life, than the Body has when ſeparate from the Soul. His Body likewiſe became corruptible and mortal; ſo that Death then took hold on this alſo. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already dead in Spirit, dead to God, dead in Sin, he haſtened on to Death everlaſting; to the Deſtruction both of Body and Soul, in the Fire never to be quenched.</p>

Thus <hi>through the Offence of one,</hi> all are dead, dead to God, dead in Sin, dwelling in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, mortal Body, ſhortly to be diſſolved, and under the Sentence of Death eternal.

                  <p n="8">8. In Conſideration of this, that the Son of God hath <hi>taſted Death for every Man,</hi> God hath now <hi>reconciled the World to himſelf, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting to them their former Treſpaſſes.</hi> And thus, <hi>as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation, even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free Gift came upon all Men unto Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</hi> So that for the Sake of his we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It does by no means imply, that God judges concerning us, contrary to the real Nature of Things: that he eſteems us better than we really are, or believes us righteous, when we are unrighteous. Surely no. The judgment of the all wiſe God, is always according to Truth.

                  <p n="5">5. The plain ſcriptural Notion of Juſtification is Pardon, the Forgiveneſs of Sins. It is that Act of God the Father, whereby for the ſake of the Propitiation made by the Blood of his Son, he <hi>ſheweth forth his Righteouſneſs</hi> (or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) <hi>by the Remiſſion of the Sins that are paſt.</hi> This is the eaſy, natural Account of it given by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> throughout this whole Epiſtle. So he explains it himſelf, more particularly in this, and in the following Chapter. Thus in the next,

He will not condemn him on that account, either in this World or in that which is to come. His Sins, all his paſt Sins, in Thought, Word and Deed, are covered, are blotted out: ſhall not be remembered or mentioned againſt him, any more than if they had not been. God will not inflict on that Sinner what he deſerved to ſuffer, becauſe the Son of his Love hath ſuffered for him. And from the Time we are <hi>accepted through the Beloved, reconciled to</hi> God <hi>through his Blood,</hi> he loves and bleſſes and watches over us for Good, even as if we had never ſinned.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Apoſtle in one Place ſeems to extend the Meaning of the Word much farther; where he ſays, <hi>Not the Hearers of the Low, but the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Law ſhall be juſtified.</hi> Here he appears to refer our Juſtification, to the Sentence of the great Day. And ſo our Lord himſelf unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably doth, when he ſays, <hi>By thy Words thou ſhalt be juſtified:</hi> proving thereby, that <hi>for every idle Word Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the Day of Judgment.</hi> But perhaps we can hardly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

III. 1. But this is the third Thing which was to be conſidered, namely, who are they that are juſtified? And the Apoſtle tells us expreſly, <hi>the Ungodly:</hi> He, that is, God, <hi>juſtifieth the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly:</hi> The Ungodly of every Kind and Degree, and none but the Ungodly. As <hi>they that are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, need no Repentance,</hi> ſo they need no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. It is only Sinners that have any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Pardon: It is Sin alone which admits of being forgiven. Forgiveneſs therefore has an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Reference to Sin, and (in this Reſpect) to nothing elſe. It is our <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> to which the pardoning God is <hi>merciful:</hi> It is our <hi>Iniquity</hi> which he <hi>remembereth no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſeems not to be at all conſidered by thoſe who ſo vehemently contend, that a Man muſt be ſanctified, that is, holy, before he can be juſtified: Eſpecially by ſuch of them as affirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it is not a <hi>Saint</hi> but a <hi>Sinner</hi> that is <hi>forgiven,</hi> and under the Notion of a Sinner. God <hi>juſtifieth</hi> not the Godly, but the <hi>Ungodly:</hi> not thoſe that are holy already, but the Unholy. Upon what Condition he doth this, will be conſidered quickly: But whatever it is, it cannot be Holineſs. To aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert this, is to ſay, the Lamb of God takes

                  <p>The firſt Propoſition is ſelf-evident. And the ſecond, That no Works done before Juſtification, are done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, will appear equally plain and

If we ever imagined this, it was for want of obſerving, that the latter, as well as the former Part of theſe Words, were ſpoken by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that, concerning the Covenant which then was. (<hi>Deut.</hi> xxx. 11, 12, 14.) But it is the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> which God through Chriſt hath eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Men in all Ages, (as well before and under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, as ſince God was manifeſt in the Fleſh) which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here oppoſes to the Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> made with <hi>Adam</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="unknown:028060_0107_0FD62874E2656798"/>while in Paradiſe; but commonly ſuppoſed to be the only Covenant which God had made with Man, particularly by thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of theſe it was that he ſo affectionately ſpeaks, in the Beginning of this Chapter. <hi>My Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they may be ſaved. For I bear them Record, that they have a Zeal for</hi> God, <hi>but not according to Knowledge. For they being ignorant of</hi> God's <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> (of the Juſtification that flows from his mere Grace and Mercy, freely forgiving our Sins through the Son of his Love, through the Redemption which is in Jeſus) <hi>and ſeeking to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> (their own Holineſs, antecedent to Faith, in <hi>him that juſtifieth the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> as the Ground of their Pardon and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) <hi>have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of</hi> God, and conſequently ſeek Death in the Error of their Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They were ignorant, that <hi>Chriſt is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,</hi> that by the Oblation of himſelf once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, he had put an End to the firſt Law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (which indeed was not given by God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> but to <hi>Adam</hi> in his State of Innocence) the ſtrict Tenor whereof, without any Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was; "Do this and live:" And at the ſame time purchaſed for us that better Covenant, "Believe and live;" Believe and thou ſhalt be ſaved; now faved both from the Guilt and Power of Sin, and, of Conſequence, from the Wages of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="4">4. And how many are equally ignorant now, even among thoſe who are called by the Name
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028060_0108_0FD68AD5D4671D30"/>of Chriſt? How many who have now a <hi>Zeal for God,</hi> yet have it not <hi>according to Knowledge:</hi> But are ſtill <hi>ſeeking to eſtabliſh their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> as the Ground of their Pardon and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; and therefore vehemently refuſe, to <hi>ſubmit themſelves unto the Righteouſneſs of</hi> God? Surely my Heart's Deſire, and Prayer to God for you, Brethren, is, that ye may be ſaved. And in order to remove this grand Stumbling-block out of your Way, I will endeavour to ſhew, firſt, What <hi>the Righteouſneſs</hi> is, <hi>which is of the Law,</hi> and what <hi>the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith;</hi> Secondly, The Folly of truſting in <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> and the Wiſdom of <hi>ſubmitting to that which is of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. 1. And, firſt, <hi>The Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, ſaith, the Man which doth theſe Things, ſhall live by them.</hi> Conſtantly and perfectly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all theſe Things to do them, and then thou ſhalt live for ever. This Law or Covenant (uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, The Covenant of <hi>Works</hi>) given by God to Man in Paradiſe, required an Obedience, perfect in all its Parts, entire and wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as the Condition of his eternal Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in the Holineſs and Happineſs wherein he was created.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It required, that Man ſhould fulfil all Righteouſneſs, inward and outward, negative and poſitive: That he ſhould not only abſtain from every idle Word, and avoid every evil Work, but ſhould keep every Affection, every Deſire, every Thought in Obedience to the Will of God. That he ſhould continue holy, as he which had created him was holy, both in Heart
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028060_0109_0FD68ADE2E6CCBD0"/>and in all Manner of Converſation: That he ſhould be pure in Heart, even as God is pure: perfect as his Father in Heaven was perfect: That he ſhould love the Lord his God with all his Heart, with all his Soul, with all his Mind, and with all his Strength: That he ſhould love every Soul which God had made, even as God had loved him: That by this univerſal Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he ſhould <hi>dwell in God</hi> (who is Love) <hi>and</hi> God <hi>in him:</hi> That he ſhould ſerve the Lord his God with all his Strength, and in all Things ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aim at his Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe were the Things which the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law required, that he who did them might live thereby. But it farther required. That this entire Obedience to God, this inward and outward Holineſs, this Conformity both of Heart and Life to his Will, ſhould be perfect in <hi>Degree.</hi> No Abatement, no Allowance could poſſibly be made, for falling ſhort in any Degree, as to any Jot or Tittle either of the outward or the inward Law. If every Commandment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to outward Things was obeyed, yet that was not ſufficient, unleſs every one was obeyed with all the Strength, in the higheſt Meaſure, and moſt perfect Manner. Nor did it anſwer the Demand of this Covenant, to love God with every Power and Faculty, unleſs he were loved with the full Capacity of each, with the whole Poſſibility of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. One Thing more was indiſpenſably required by the Righteouſneſs of the Law, namely, that this univerſal Obedience, this perfect Holineſs both of Heart and Life, ſhould be perfectly unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted alſo, ſhould continue without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028060_0110_0FD68ADFAA016EE8"/>from the Moment wherein God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Man, and breathed into his Noſtrile the Breath of Life, until the Days of his Trial ſhould be ended, and he ſhould be confirmed in Life everlaſting.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Righteouſneſs then which is of the Law, ſpeaketh on this wiſe. "Thou, O Man of God, ſtand faſt in Love, in the Image of God, wherein thou art made. If then wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Life, keep the Commandments, which are now written in thy Heart. Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart. Love as thyſelf every Soul that he hath made. Deſire nothing but God. Aim at God in every Thought, in every Word and Work. Swerve not in one Motion of Body or Soul, from him thy Mark and the Prize of thy high Calling. And let all that is in thee praiſe his holy Name, every Power and Faculty of thy Soul, in every Kind, in every Degree, and at every Moment of thine Exiſtence. <hi>This do, and thou ſhalt live:</hi> Thy Light ſhall ſhine, thy Love ſhall ſlame more and more, till thou art received up into the Houſe of God in the Heavens, to reign with him for ever and ever."</p>

Indeed, ſtrictly ſpeaking, the Covenant of <hi>Grace</hi> doth not requre us, to <hi>do</hi> any thing at all, as abſolutely and indiſpenſably neceſſary in order to our Juſtification: But only, to believe in him, who, for the Sake of his Son, and the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he hath made, <q>juſtifieth the Ungodly that worketh not,</q> and imputes his Faith to him for Righteouſneſs.

                  <p n="9">9. What ſaith then the Covenant of Forgiveneſs, of unmerited Love, of pardoning Mercy? <hi>Believe

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028060_0114_0FD68AEC321E2788"/>God, having the Wrath of God abiding on him, and haſtening through Sin, whereby his Soul is dead, to bodily Death, and Death everlaſting. And to Man in this State, it preſcribes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whereon he may regain the Pearl he has loſt: May recover the Favour, and the Image of God, may retrieve the Life of God in his Soul, and be reſtored to the Knowledge and the Love of God, which is the Beginning of Life eternal.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Again, the Covenant of Works, in order to Man's <hi>Continuance</hi> in the Favour of God, in his Knowledge and Love, in Holineſs and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, required of perfect Man, a <hi>perfect</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted <hi>Obedience,</hi> to every Point of the Law of God. Whereas the Covenant of Grace, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Man's <hi>Recovery,</hi> of the Favour and Life of God, requires only <hi>Faith;</hi> living Faith in him who through God juſtifies him that <hi>obeyed not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Yet again: The Covenant of Works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Children, to <hi>pay the Price themſelves,</hi> in Conſideration of which, they were to receive all the future Bleſſings of God. But in the Covenant of Grace, ſeeing we have nothing to pay, God <hi>frankly forgives us all:</hi> Provided only, that we believe in him, who hath <hi>paid the Frice for us;</hi> who hath given himſelf a <hi>Propitiation for our Sins, for the Sins of the whole World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Thus the firſt Covenant required what is now <hi>afar off</hi> from all the Children of Men; namely, unlinning Obedience, which is far from thoſe who are <hi>conceived and born in Sin.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſecond requires what is nigh at hand; as tho' it ſhould ſay, Thou art Sin! God is Love. Thou by Sin art fallen ſhort of the Glory of
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028060_0115_0FD68AED9E1A4C80"/>God; yet there is Mercy with him. Bring then all thy Sins to the Pardoning God, and they ſhall vaniſh away as a Cloud. If thou wert not ungodly, there would be no room for him to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify thee as ungodly. But now draw near, in full Aſſurance of Faith. He ſpeaketh, and it is done. Fear not, only believe; for even the juſt God <hi>juſtifieth all that believe in Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. 1. Theſe Things conſidered, it will be eaſy to ſhew, as I propoſed to do in the ſecond Place, the Folly of truſting in the <hi>Righteouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> and the Wiſdom of <hi>ſubmitting to the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Folly of thoſe who ſtill truſt, in the <hi>Righteouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> the Terms of which are, Do this and live, may abundantly appear from hence. They ſet out wrong. Their very firſt Step is a fundamental Miſtake. For before they can ever think of claiming any Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the Terms of this Covenant, they muſt ſuppoſe themſelves to be in his State, with whom this Covenant was made. But how vain a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is this? Since it was made with <hi>Adam</hi> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> State of Innocence. How weak therefore muſt that whole Building be, which ſtands on ſuch a Foundation? And how fooliſh are they who thus build on the Sand? Who ſeem never to have conſidered, that the Covenant of Works was not given to Man, when he was dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Sins, but when he was alive to God, when he knew no Sin, but was holy as God is holy: Who forget, that it was never deſign'd for the <hi>Recovery</hi> of the Favour and Life of God once loſt, but only for the <hi>Continuance</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028060_0116_0FD68AF0DF393D88"/>thereof, till it ſhould be compleat in Life everlaſting.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither do they conſider, who are thus <hi>ſeeking to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> what manner of Obedience or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that is, which the Law indiſpenſably requires. It muſt be perfect and entire, in every Point, or it anſwers not the Demand of the Law. But which of you is able to perform ſuch Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Or, conſequently, to live thereby? Who among you fulfils every Jot and Tittle even of the outward Commandments of God? Doing nothing, great or ſmall, which God forbids? Leaving nothing undone which he enjoins? Speaking no <hi>idle Word?</hi> Having your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation always <hi>meet to miniſter Grace to the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</hi> And <hi>whether you eat or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do,</hi> doing <hi>all to the Glory of</hi> God? And how much leſs are you able to fulfil all the inward Commandments of God? Thoſe which require, that every Temper and motion of your Soul ſhould be Holineſs unto the Lord? Are you able, To <hi>love</hi> God <hi>with all your Heart?</hi> To love all Mankind as your own Soul? To <hi>pray without ceaſing? In every Thing to give Thanks?</hi> To have God always before you? And to keep every Affection, Deſire and Thought, in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Law?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You ſhould farther conſider, That the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law requires, not only the obeying every Command of God, negative and poſitive, internal and external, but likewiſe in the perfect Degree. In every inſtance whatever, the Voice of the Law is, Thou ſhalt ſerve the Lord thy God with all thy Strength. It allows no Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028060_0117_0FD68AF0E3A434E0"/>of any Kind. It excuſes no Defect. It condemns every coming ſhort of the full Meaſure of Obedience, and immediately pronounces a Curſe on the Offender. It regards only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable Rules of Juſtice, and ſaith, "I know not to ſhew Mercy."</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Who then can appear before ſuch a Judge, which is <hi>extreme to mark what is done amiſs?</hi> How weak are they who deſire to be tried at the Bar, where <hi>no Fleſh living can be juſtified?</hi> None of the Offspring of <hi>Adam.</hi> For ſuppoſe we did now keep every Commandment with all our Strength: Yet one ſingle Breach which ever was, utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys our whole Claim to Life. If we have ever offended in any one Point, this Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is at an end. For the Law condemns all who do not perform uninterrupted as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience. So that according to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this, for him who hath once finned, in any Degree, <hi>there remaineth only a fearful Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for of fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Is it not then the very Fooliſhneſs of Folly, for fallen Man to ſeek Life by this Righteouſneſs? For Man, who was <hi>ſhapen in Wickedneſs,</hi> and <hi>in Sin did his Mother conceive him:</hi> Man, who is by Nature all <hi>earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh,</hi> altogether <hi>corrupt and abominable:</hi> In whom, till he find Grace, <hi>dwelleth no good Thing;</hi> nay, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of himſelf think one good Thought? Who is indeed all Sin, a mere Lump of Ungodlineſs, and who commits Sin in every Breath he draws; whoſe actual Tranſgreſſions, in Word and Deed, are more in Number than the Hairs of his Head! What Stupidity, what Senſeleſneſs muſt it be
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028060_0118_0FD68AF45DB583B8"/>for ſuch an unclean, guilty, helpleſs Worm as this, to dream of ſeeking Acceptance by <hi>his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> of living by <hi>the Righteouſneſs</hi> which <hi>is of the Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now whatſoever Conſiderations prove the Folly of truſting in the <hi>Righteouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> prove equally the Wiſdom of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>the Righteouſneſs which is of</hi> God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <hi>Faith.</hi> This were eaſy to be ſhewn with regard to each of the preceding Conſiderations. But to wave this, the Wiſdom of the firſt ſtep hereto, the diſclaiming our own Righteouſneſs, plainly appears from hence, That it is acting according to Truth, to the real Nature of Things. For what is it more, than to acknowledge with our Heart as well as Lips, the true State wherein we are? To acknowledge, that we bring with us into the World, a corrupt, ſinful Nature; more corrupt indeed than we can eaſily conceive, or find Words to expreſs? That hereby we are prone to all that is evil, and averſe from all that is good; that we are full of Pride, Self-will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Paſſions, fooliſh Deſires, vile and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affections; Lovers of the World, Lovers of Pleaſure more than Lovers of God? That our Lives have been no better than our Hearts, but many ways ungodly and unholy; inſomuch that our actual Sins, both in Word and Deed, have been as the Stars of Heaven for Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: That on all theſe Accounts, we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity; and deſerve nothing from him, but Indignation and Wrath and Death, the due Wages of Sin? That we cannot by any of our Righteouſneſs, (for indeed, we have none at all)
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028060_0119_0FD68AF573AAF590"/>nor by any of our Works (for they are as the Tree from which they grow) appeaſe the Wrath of God, or avert the Puniſhment we have juſtly deſerved; Yea, that, if left to ourſelves, we ſhall only was worſe and worſe, ſink deeper and deeper into Sin, offend God more and more both with our evil Works, and with the evil Tempers of our carnal Mind, till we fill up the Meaſure of our Iniquities, and bring upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſwiſt Deſtruction? And is not this the very State wherein by Nature we are? To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this then, both with our Heart and Lips, that is, to diſclaim our own Righteouſneſs, <hi>the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> is to act according to the Real Nature of Things, and conſequently is an inſtance of true Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Wiſdom of ſubmitting to <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith,</hi> appears farther from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. That it is the Righteouſneſs of God: I mean here, It is that Method of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, which hath been choſe and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by God himſelf, not only as he is the God of Wiſdom, but as he is the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth, and of every Creature which he hath made. Now as it is not meet for Man to ſay unto God. What doſt thou? As none who is not utterly void of Underſtanding, will contend with one that is mightier than he, with him whoſe Kingdom ruleth over all; ſo it is true Wiſdom, it is a Mark of ſound Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to acquieſce in whatever he hath choſen, to ſay in this, as in all Things, "It is the Lord. Let him do what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eemeth him Good."</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It may be farther conſidered. That it was of mere Grace, of free Love, of undeſerved
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028060_0120_0FD68AF6D6C767D8"/>Mercy, that God hath vouchſafed to ſinful Man, any way of Reconciliation with himſelf, that we were not out away from his Hand, and utterly blotted out of his Remembrance. Therefore whatever Method he is pleaſed to appoint, of his tender Mercy, of his unmerited Goodneſs, whereby his Enemies, who have ſo deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from him, ſo long and obſtinately rebelled againſt him, may ſtill find Favour in his Sight, it is doubtleſs our Wiſdom to accept with all Thankfulneſs.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To mention but one Conſideration more. It is wiſdom to aim at the beſt End by the beſt Means. Now the beſt End which any Creature can purſue, is Happineſs in God. And the beſt End a fallen Creature can purſue is, The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Favour and Image of God. But the beſt, indeed the only Means under Heaven given to Man, whereby he may regain the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, which is better than Life itſelf, or the Image of God, which is the true Life of the Soul, is the ſubmitting to the <hi>Righteouſneſs which is of Faith,</hi> the believing in the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. 1. Whoſoever therefore thou art who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt to be forgiven and reconciled to the Favour of God; Do not ſay in thy Heart, "I muſt <hi>firſt do this;</hi> I muſt <hi>firſt</hi> conquer every Sin; break off every evil Word and Work, and do all Good to all Men: Or, I muſt <hi>firſt</hi> go to Church, receive the Lord's Supper, hear more Sermons, and ſay more Prayers." Alas, my Brother, thou art clean gone out of the Way. Thou art ſtill <hi>ignorant of the Righteouſneſs of</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="unknown:028060_0121_0FD68AF86FE3DF58"/>God, and art <hi>ſeeking to eſtabliſh thy own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> as the Ground of thy Reconciliation. Knoweſt thou not, that thou canſt do nothing but ſin, till thou art reconciled to God? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then doſt thou ſay, I <hi>muſt do this</hi> and this <hi>firſt,</hi> and then I ſhall believe. Nay, but <hi>Firſt Believe.</hi> Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Propitiation for thy Sins. Let this good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <hi>firſt</hi> be laid, and then thou ſhalt do all Things well.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither ſay in thy Heart, "I can't be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted yet, becauſe I am not <hi>good enough.</hi>" Who is <hi>good enough?</hi> Who ever was? To merit Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance at God's Hands! Was ever any Child of <hi>Adam good enough</hi> for this? Or will any, till the Conſummation of all Things? And as for thee, thou art not good at all: There dwelleth in thee no good Thing. And thou never wilt be, till thou believe in Jeſus. Rather thou wilt find thyſelf worſe and worſe. But is there any need of being worſe, in order to be accepted? Art thou not <hi>bad enough</hi> already? Indeed thou art, and that God knoweth. And thou thyſelf canſt not deny it. Then delay not. All Things are now ready. <hi>Ariſe and waſh away thy Sins.</hi> The Fountain is open. Now is the Time, to waſh thee white in the Blood of the Lamb. Now he ſhall <hi>purge</hi> thee as <hi>with Hyſſop, and</hi> thou <hi>ſhalt be clean; he</hi> ſhall <hi>waſh</hi> thee, and thou <hi>ſhalt be whiter than Snow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do not ſay, "But I am not <hi>contrite enough:</hi> I am not <hi>ſenſible enough</hi> of my Sins." I know it. I would to God, thou wert more <hi>ſenſible</hi> of them, more <hi>contrite</hi> a thouſand fold than thou art. But do not ſtay for this. It may be God will make
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028060_0122_0FD68AFDD8BBFC48"/>thee ſo, not before thou believeſt, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. It may be, thou wilt nor weep much, till thou loveſt much, becauſe thou haſt had much forgiven. In the mean time, look unto Jeſus. Behold how he loveth thee! What could he have done more for thee which he hath not done?
<q>
                        <l>"O Lamb of God, was ever Pain,</l>
                        <l>Was ever Love like Thine!"</l>
                     </q>
Look ſteadily upon him, till he looks on thee, and breaks thy hard Heart. Then ſhall thy <hi>Head</hi> be <hi>Waters, and</hi> thy <hi>Eyes Fountains of Tears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor yet do thou ſay, "I muſt <hi>do</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, <hi>before</hi> I come to Chriſt." I grant, ſuppoſing thy Lord ſhould delay his coming, it were meet and right to wait for his appearing, in doing ſo far as thou haſt Power, whatſoever he hath commanded thee. But there is no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for making ſuch a Suppoſition. How know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou that he will delay? Perhaps he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as the Day-ſpring from on High, before the Morning-light. O do not ſet him a Time. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him every Hour. Now, he is nigh! Even at the Door!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And to what End wouldſt thou wait for <hi>more Sincerity, before</hi> thy Sins are blotted out? To make thee more worthy of the Grace of God? Alas, thou art ſtill <hi>eſtabliſhing thy own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> He will have Mercy, not becauſe thou art worthy of it, but becauſe his Compaſſions fail not: Not becauſe thou art righteous; but becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath atoned for thy Sins.</p>
                  <p>Again, if there be any thing good in <hi>Sincerity,</hi> why doſt thou expect it, <hi>before</hi> thou haſt Faith? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028060_0123_0FD68AFF20C68890"/>Faith itſelf is the only Root of whatever is really good and holy.</p>
                  <p>Above all, How long wilt thou forget, That whatſoever thou doſt, or whatſoever thou haſt, before thy Sins are forgiven thee, it avails nothing with God, toward the procuring of thy For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs? Yea, and that it muſt all be caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thy Back, trampled under Foot, made no Account of, or thou wilt never find Favour in God's Sight; becauſe until then thou canſt not aſk it, as a mere Sinner, guilty, loſt, undone, having nothing to plead, nothing to offer to God, but only the Merits of his well-beloved Son, <hi>who loved</hi> thee, <hi>and gave himſelf for</hi> thee.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To conlude. Whoſoever thou art, O Man, who haſt the Sentence of Death in thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who feeleſt thyſelf a condemned Sinner, and haſt the Wrath of God abiding on thee: Unto thee ſaith the Lord, Not, Do this: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obey all my Commands and live: But, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.

Suppoſing theſe to be ever ſo decent and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, ever ſo expreſſive of inward Things: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them ever ſo helpful, not only to the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, whoſe Thought reaches little farther than their Sight; but even to Men of Underſtanding, Men of ſtronger Capacities, as doubtleſs they may ſometimes be: Yea, ſuppoſing them, as in the Caſe of the Jews, to be appointed by God himſelf; yet even during the Period of Time wherein that Appointment remains in Force, True Religion does not principally conſiſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; nay, ſtrictly ſpeaking, not at all. How much more muſt this hold concerning ſuch Rights and Forms, as are only of Human Appointment? The Religion of Chriſt riſes infinitely higher, and lies immenſely deeper than all theſe. Theſe
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028060_0127_0FD68B081B7B9560"/>are good in their Place; juſt ſo far as they are in fact ſubſervient to true Religion. And it were Superſtition to object againſt them, while they are applied only as occaſional Helps to Human Weakneſs. But let no Man carry them farther. Let no Man dream, that they have any intrinſic Worth; or that Religion cannot ſubſiſt without them. This were to make them an Abomination to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Nature of Religion is ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in theſe, in <hi>Forms</hi> of Worſhip, or <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that it does not properly conſiſt in any <hi>outward Actions,</hi> of what Kind ſoever. It is true, a Man cannot have any Religion, who is guilty of vicious, immoral Actions; or who does to others, what he would not they ſhould do to him, if he were in the ſame Circumſtance. And it is alſo true, that he can have no real Religion, who <hi>knows to do good, and doth it not.</hi> Yet may a Man both abſtain from outward Evil, and do Good, and ſtill have no Religion. Yea, two Perſons may do the ſame outward Work, ſuppoſe, Feeding the Hungry, or Cloathing the Naked: And, in the Mean Time, one of theſe may be truly Religious, and the other have no Religion at all: For the one may act from the Love of God, and the other from the Love of Praiſe. So manifeſt it is; that altho' true Religion natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally leads to every good Word and Work, yet the Real Nature thereof lies deeper ſtill, even in <hi>the Hidden Man of the Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. I ſay of <hi>the Heart.</hi> For neither does Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conſiſt in <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> or <hi>Right Opinions;</hi> which altho' they are not properly outward things, and not in the Heart, but the Underſtanding.
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028060_0128_0FD68B0B6936DB88"/>A Man may be orthodox in every Point; he may not only eſpouſe Right Opinions, but zealouſly defend them againſt all Oppoſers: He may think juſtly concerning the Incarnation of our Lord, concerning the ever bleſſed Trinity, and every other Doctrine, contained in the Oracles of God: He may aſſent to all the three Creeds; that called The Apoſtles, the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſian:</hi> And yet 'tis poſſible, he may have no Religion at all, no more than a <hi>Jew, Turk,</hi> or <hi>Pagan.</hi> He may be almoſt as orthodox as — the Devil; (tho' indeed, not altogether. For every Man errs in ſomething; whereas we can't well conceive him to hold any erroneous Opinion) and may all the while be as great a Stranger as he to the Religion of the Heart.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This alone is Religion, truly ſo called: This alone is in the Sight of God of great Price. The Apoſtle ſums it all up in three Particulars, <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Pence, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And firſt, <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> We cannot be at a Loſs concerning this, if we remember the Words of our Lord deſcribing the two grand Branches thereof, or which <hi>hang all the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.

                     <hi>Strength. This is the Firſt and great Commandment,</hi> the firſt and great Branch of Chriſtian Righteouſneſs. Thou ſhalt delight thyſelf in the Lord thy God; thou ſhalt ſeek and find all Happineſs in Him. He ſhall be <hi>thy Shield, and thy exceeding great Reward,</hi> in Time and in Eternity. All thy Bones ſhall ſay, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? And there is

                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. And the Second Commandment is like unto this; the Second great Branch of Chriſtian Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is cloſely and inſeparably connected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, even <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Thou ſhalt love</hi>— Thou ſhalt embrace with the moſt tender good-will, the moſt earneſt and cordial Affection, the moſt inflamed Deſires of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting or removing all Evil, and of procuring for him every poſſible Good—<hi>Thy Neighbour</hi>—that is, not only thy Friend, thy Kinſman, or thy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; not only the Virtuous, the Friendly, him that loves thee, that prevents or returns thy Kindneſs; but every Child of Man, every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Creature, every Soul which God hath made: Not excepting him whom thou never haſt ſeen in the Fleſh, whom thou knoweſt not either by Face or Name: Not excepting him whom thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be evil and unthankful, him that ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfully uſes and perſecutes thee. Him thou ſhalt <hi>love as thyſelf;</hi> with the ſame invariable Thirſt after his Happineſs in every Kind: the ſame unwearied Care to ſkreen him from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might grieve or hurt either his Soul or Body.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now is not this Love <hi>The fulfilling of the Law?</hi> The Sum of all Chriſtian Righteouſneſs?
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028060_0130_0FD68B0FEEDC0478"/>Of all inward Righteouſneſs; for it neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Bowels of Mercies, Humbleneſs of Mind</hi> (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Love is not puffed up) Gentleneſs, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering,</hi> (for Love <hi>is not provoked</hi> but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, hopeth, endureth all Things</hi>) and of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Righteouſneſs; for <hi>Love worketh no Evil to his Neighbour,</hi> either by Word or Deed. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not willingly either hurt or grieve any one. And it is zealous of Good Works.

                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. But true Religion, or a Heart right toward God and Man, implies Happineſs as well as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. For it is not only <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> but alſo <hi>Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> What Peace? <hi>The Peace of</hi> God, which God only can give and the World cannot take away: The Peace which <hi>paſſeth all Underſtanding,</hi> all (barely) rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Conception; being a ſupernatural Senſation, a divine Taſte of <hi>the Powers of the World to come:</hi> Such as the natural Man knoweth not, how wiſe ſoever in the Things of this World: Nor indeed can he know it, in his preſent State, <hi>becauſe it is ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> It is a Peace that baniſhes all Doubt, all painful Uncertainty; the Spirit of God <hi>bearing witneſs with the Spirit</hi> of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that he is <hi>a Child of</hi> God. And it baniſhes Fear, all ſuch Fear as hath Torment; the Fear of the Wrath of God, the Fear of Hell, the Fear of the Devil, and in particular, the Fear of Death: he that hath the Peace of God, <hi>deſiring</hi> (if it were the Will of God) <hi>to depart and to be with Chriſt.</hi>

11. With this Peace of God, wherever it is fixed in the Soul, there is alſo <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> Joy wrought in the Heart by the Holy Ghoſt, by the ever bleſſed Spirit of God.

                     <hi>whoſe Unrighteouſneſs is forgiven, and whoſe Sin is covered.</hi> He it is that inſpires the Chriſtian Soul, with that even, ſolid Joy, which ariſes from the Teſtimony of the Spirit, that he is a Child of God: And that gives him to <hi>rejoice with Joy unſpeakable, in Hope of the Glory of</hi> God: Hope, both of the glorious Image of God, which is in part and ſhall be fully <hi>revealed in him;</hi> and of that Crown of Glory, which fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for him.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. This Holineſs and happineſs joined in one, are ſometimes ſtiled in the inſpired Writings, <hi>the Kingdom of</hi> God, (as by our Lord in the Text) and ſometimes, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> It is termed, <hi>the Kingdom of</hi> God, becauſe it is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Fruit of God's reigning in the Soul.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. 1. This is the Way. Walk ye in it. And firſt, Repent, that is, Know yourſelves. This is the firſt Repentance, previous to Faith; even Conviction, or Self-Knowledge. Awake then thou that ſleepeſt. Know thyſelf to be a Sinner, and what Manner of Sinner thou art. Know that Corruption of thy inmoſt Nature, whereby thou art very far gone from Original Righteouſneſs, whereby <hi>the Fleſh luſteth</hi> always <hi>contrary to the Spirit,</hi> through that <hi>carnal Mind which is Enmity againſt</hi> God, which <hi>is not ſubject to the Law of</hi> God, <hi>neither indeed can be.</hi> Know that thou art corrupted in every Power, in every Faculty of thy Soul; that thou art totally corrupted in every one of theſe, all the Foundations being out of Courſe. The Eyes of thine Underſtanding are darkened, ſo that they cannot diſcern God or the Things of God. The Clouds of Ignorance and Error reſt upon thee, and cover thee with the Shadow of Death. Thou knoweſt nothing yet, as thou oughteſt to know, neither God, nor the World, nor thyſelf. Thy Will is no longer the Will of God, but is utterly perverſe and diſtorted, averſe from all Good, from all which God loves, and prone to all Evil, to every Abomination which God hateth. Thy Affections are alienated from God, and ſcattered abroad over all the Earth. All thy Paſſions, both thy Deſires and Averſions, thy Joys and Sorrows, thy Hopes and Fears, are out of Frame, are either undue in their Degree, or placed on undue Objects. So that there is no Soundneſs in thy Soul; but <hi>from the Crown of the

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such is the inbred Corruption of thy Heart, of thy very inmoſt Nature. And what Manner of Branches canſt thou expect to grow, from ſuch an evil Root? Hence ſprings Unbelief, ever depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the living God: Saying, "Who is the Lord that I ſhould ſerve him? Tuſh! Thou, God, careſt not for it." Hence Independence, affecting to be like the Moſt High; hence Pride, in all its Forms, teaching thee to ſay, "I am rich, and increaſed in Goods, and have need of nothing." From this evil Fountain flow forth the bitter ſtreams of Vanity, Thirſt of Praiſe; Ambition, Covetouſneſs; the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life. From this ariſe Anger, Hatred, Malice, Revenge, Envy, Jealouſy, evil Surmiſings: From this all the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and hurtful Luſts, that now <hi>pierce thee through with many Sorrows,</hi> and if not timely prevented, will at length <hi>drown thy Soul in everlaſting Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And what Fruits can grow on ſuch Branches as theſe? Only ſuch as are bitter and evil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. Of Pride cometh Contention, vain boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeking and receiving Praiſe of Men, and ſo robbing God of that Glory which he cannot give unto another. Of the Luſt of the Fleſh come Gluttony or Drunkenneſs, Luxury or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality: Fornication, Uncleanneſs, variouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing that Body, which was deſigned for a Temple of the Holy Ghoſt: Of Unbelief, every evil Word and Work. But the Time would fail, ſhould'ſt thou reckon up all; all the idle Words
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028060_0135_0FD68B182F857B48"/>thou haſt ſpoken, provoking the Moſt High, grieving the holy One of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> All the evil Works thou haſt done, either wholly evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or at leaſt, not done to the Glory of God. For thy actual Sins are more than thou art able to expreſs, more than the Hairs of thy Head. Who can number the Sands of the Sea, or the Drops of Rain, or thy Iniquities?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And knoweſt thou not that <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death?</hi> Death not only temporal, but eternal. <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die:</hi> For the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.

This is the Sentence, to <hi>be puniſhed</hi> with never-ending Death, <hi>with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</hi> Knoweſt thou not that every Sinner, <gap reason="foreign">

Thou art guilty of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death. It is the juſt Reward of thy Inward and Outward Wickedneſs. It is juſt, that the Sentence ſhould now take place. Doſt thou ſee, doſt thou feel this? Art thou thoroughly convinced, that thou deſerveſt God's Wrath and everlaſting Damnation? Would God do thee no wrong, if he now commanded the Earth to open and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee up? If thou wert now to go down quick into the Pit, into the Fire that never ſhall be quenched? If God hath given thee truly to repent, thou haſt a deep Senſe that theſe Things are ſo; and that it is of his mere Mercy thou art not conſumed, ſwept away from the Face of the Earth.</p>

5. And what wilt thou do to appeaſe the Wrath of God, to atone for all thy Sins, and to eſcape the Puniſhment thou haſt ſo juſtly deſerved? Alas, thou canſt do nothing: Nothing that will in any wiſe make amends to God, for one evil Work, or Word, or Thought. If thou couldſt now do all Things well, if from this very Hour, till thy Soul ſhould return to God, thou couldeſt perform perfect uninterrupted Obedience, even this would not atone for what is paſt. The not increaſing thy Debt would not diſcharge it. It would ſtill remain as great as ever. Yea, the preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Obedience of all the Men upon Earth, and all the Angels in Heaven, would never make Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Juſtice of God for one ſingle Sin. How vain then was the Thought, of aton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thy own Sins by any Thing thou could'ſt do? It coſteth far more to redeem one Soul, than all Mankind is able to pay. So that were there no other Help for a guilty Sinner, without Doubt he muſt have periſhed everlaſtingly.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But ſuppoſe perfect Obedience for the time to come, could atone for the Sins that are paſt, this would profit thee nothing; for thou art not able to perform it; no, not in any one Point. Begin now. Make the Trial. Shake off that outward Sin that ſo eaſily beſetteth thee. Thou canſt not. How then wilt thou change thy Life from all Evil to all Good? Indeed, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be done, unleſs firſt thy Heart be changed. For ſo long as the Tree remains evil, it cannot bring forth good Fruit. But art thou able to change thy own Heart, from all Sin to all Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? To quicken a Soul that is dead in Sin? Dead to God and alive only to the World? No more
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028060_0137_0FD68B1DDEB9EFB0"/>than thou art able to quicken a dead Body, to raiſe to Life him that lieth in the Grave. Yea, thou art not able to quicken thy Soul in any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, no more than to give any Degree of Life to the dead Body. Thou canſt do nothing more or leſs, in this Matter; thou art utterly without Strength. To be deeply ſenſible of this, how helpleſs thou art, as well as how guilty and how ſinful, this is that <hi>Repentance not to be repented of,</hi> which is the Fore-runner of the Kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If to this lively Conviction of thy inward and outward Sins, of thy utter Guiltineſs and Helpleſſneſs, there be added ſuitable Affections, Sorrow of Heart, for having deſpiſed thy own Mercies, Remorſe and Self-condemnation, having the Mouth ſtop'd, aſhamed to lift up thine Eyes to Heaven; Fear of the Wrath of God abiding on thee, of his Curſe hanging over thy Head, and of the fiery Indignation ready to devour thoſe who forget God, and obey not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Earneſt Deſire to eſcape from that Indignation, to ceaſe from evil and learn to do well: Then I ſay unto thee in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of GOD.</hi> One Step more and thou ſhalt enter in. Thou doſt <hi>repent.</hi> Now, <hi>Believe the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>The Goſpel</hi> (that is, good Tidings, good News for guilty, helpleſs Sinners) in the largeſt Senſe of the Word, means, the whole Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to Men by Jeſus Chriſt: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the whole Account of what our Lord did and ſuffered, while he tabernacled among Men. The Subſtance of all is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners.</hi> Or, <hi>GOD ſo loved the

                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. Believe this and the Kingdom of God is thine. By Faith thou attaineſt the Promiſe.

It is not (as ſome have fondly conceived) a bare Aſſent to the Truth of the Bible, of the Articles of our Creed, or of all that is contained in the Old and New Teſtament.

                  <p n="3">III. 1. It remains only, to draw ſome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inferences from the preceeding Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt, If there be <hi>no Condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, and walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit,</hi> on account of their paſt Sin: Then why art thou fearful, O thou of little Faith? Tho' thy Sins were once more in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than the Sand, what is that to thee now thou art in Chriſt Jeſus? <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the Charge of</hi> God's <hi>Elect?

Thou art now <hi>born of the Spirit:</hi> Wilt thou be troubled or afraid of what was done before thou wert horn? Away with thy Fears! Thou art not called to Fear; but to the <hi>Spirit of Love and of a ſound
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028060_0154_0FD68B4D1989C010"/>Mind.</hi> Know thy Calling. Rejoice in God thy Saviour, and give Thanks to God thy Father through him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wilt thou ſay, "But I have again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Sin, ſince I had Redemption through his Blood? And therefore it is, that <hi>I abhor myſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi>" It is meet thou ſhouldſt abhor thyſelf; and it is God who hath wrought thee to this ſelf-ſame Thing. But doſt thou now believe? Hath he again enabled thee to ſay, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth: And the Life which I now live, I live by Faith in the Son of</hi> God? Then that Faith again cancels all that is paſt, and there is no Condemnation to thee. At whatſoever Time thou truly believeſt in the Name of the Son of God, all thy Sins antecedent to that Hour, vaniſh away as the Morning Dew. Now then, <hi>Stand thou faſt in the Liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath made thee free.</hi> He hath once more made thee free from the Power of Sin, as well as from the Guilt and Puniſhment of it. <hi>O be not intangled again with the Yoke of Bondage!</hi> Neither the vile deviliſh Bondage of Sin; of evil Deſires, evil Tempers, or Words or Works, the moſt grievous Yoke on this Side Hell; Nor the Bondage of ſlaviſh tormenting Fear, of Guilt and Self-condemnation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But, Secondly: Do all they which abide <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus, walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit?</hi> Then we cannot but infer, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever now committeth Sin, hath no Part or Lot in this Matter. He is even now condemned by his own Heart. But <hi>if our Heart condemn us,</hi> if our own Conſcience beareth Witneſs that we are guilty, undoubtedly God doth: For <hi>he is greater
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028060_0155_0FD68B503B85C330"/>than our Heart, and knoweth all Things;</hi> ſo that we cannot doceive him, if we can ourſelves. And think not to ſay, "I was juſtified once; my Sins were once forgiven me." I know not that: Neither will I diſpute whether they were or no. Perhaps, at this Diſtance of Time, 'tis next to impoſſible to know with any tolerable Degree of Certainty, whether that was a true, genuine Work of God, or whether thou didſt only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy own Soul. But this I know with the utmoſt Degree of Certainty, <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</hi> Therefore thou art of thy Father the Devil. It cannot be denied: For the Works of thy Father thou doſt. O flatter not thyſelf with vain Hopes. Say not to thy Soul, Peace, Peace! For there is no Peace. Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud! Cry unto God out of the Deep; if haply he may hear thy Voice. Come unto him as at firſt, as wretched and poor, as ſinful, miſerable, blind and naked. And beware thou ſuffer thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thirdly, Is there no Condemnation to them which <hi>walk after the Spirit,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>inward Sin</hi> ſtill remaining, ſo long as they do not give Way thereto; nor by reaſon of <hi>Sin cleaving</hi> to all they do? Then fret not thyſelf becauſe of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, tho' it ſtill remain in thy Heart. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine not, becauſe thou ſtill comeſt ſhort of the glorious Image of God: Nor yet, becauſe Pride, Self-will, or Unbelief, cleave to all thy Words and Works. And be not afraid to know all this Evil of thy Heart, to know thyſelf as alſo thou art known. Yea, deſire of God, that thou mayſt
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:028060_0156_0FD68B5385194470"/>not think of thyſelf more highly than thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to think. Let thy continual Prayer be,

                        <l>"Shew me, as my Soul can bear,</l>
                        <l>The Depth of inbred Sin:</l>
                        <l>All the Unbelief declare,</l>
                        <l>The Pride that lurks within!"</l>
                     </q>
But when he heareth thy Prayer, and unveils thy Heart, when he ſhews thee thoroughly what Spirit thou art of: Then beware that thy Faith fail thee not, that thou ſuffer not thy Shield to be torn from thee. Be abaſed. Be humbled in the Duſt. See thyſelf nothing, leſs than Nothing and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But ſtill, <hi>let not</hi> thy <hi>Heart be troubled, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it be afraid.</hi> Still hold faſt. "<hi>I,</hi> even I, <hi>have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Rightecus.</hi> And as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo is his Love higher than even my Sins."—Therefore God is merciful to thee a Sinner! Such a Sinner as thou art! God is Love; and Chriſt hath died. Therefore the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf loveth thee. Thou art his Child. Therefore he will with-hold from thee no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thing that is good. Is it good, that the whole Body of Sin, which is now crucified in thee, ſhould be deſtroyed?

One who is in the firſt State of Mind, without Fear or Love, is in Scripture termed <hi>a natural Man.</hi> One who is under the Spirit of Bondage and Fear, is ſometimes ſaid to be <hi>under the Law:</hi> (Altho' that Expreſſion more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies One, who is under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, who thinks himſelf obliged to obſerve all the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewiſh Law.</hi>) But one who has exchanged the Spirit of Fear for the Spirit of Love, is properly ſaid, To be <hi>under Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe it highly imports us, to know what Spirit we are of, I ſhall endeavour to point out diſtinctly, Firſt, The State of a <hi>natural Man,</hi> Secondly, That of one who is <hi>under the Law,</hi> and Thirdly, of one who is <hi>under Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. 1. And, Firſt, the State of a <hi>natural Man.</hi> This the Scripture repreſents as a State of Sleep. The Voice of God to him is, <hi>Awake, thou that ſleepeſt.</hi> For his Soul is in a deep Sleep. His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Senſes are not awake: They diſcern neither Spiritual Good nor Evil. The Eyes of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are cloſed; they are ſealed together, and ſee not. Clouds and Darkneſs continually
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028060_0162_0FD68B62E830E8F0"/>reſt upon them; for he lies in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Hence having no Inlets for the Knowledge of Spiritual Things, all the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of his Soul being ſhut up, he is in groſs, ſtupid Ignorance of whatever he is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to know. He is utterly ignorant of God, knowing nothing concerning him as he ought to know. He is totally a Stranger to the Law of God, as to its True, Inward, Spiritual Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He has no Conception of that Evangelical Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord; nor of the Happineſs, which they only find, whoſe <hi>Life is hid with Chriſt in</hi> God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And for this very Reaſon, becauſe he is faſt <hi>aſleep,</hi> he is, in ſome Senſe, at <hi>Reſt.</hi> Becauſe he is <hi>blind,</hi> he is alſo <hi>ſecure:</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Tuſh, there ſhall no Harm happen unto me.</hi> The Darkneſs which covers him on every Side, keeps him in a kind of Peace: (So far as Peace can conſiſt with the Works of the Devil, and with an earthly, deviliſh Mind.) He <hi>ſees</hi> not that he ſtands on the Edge of the Pit; therefore he <hi>fears</hi> it not. He cannot <hi>tremble</hi> at the Danger he does not <hi>know.</hi> He has not underſtanding enough to fear. Why is it that he is in no Dread of God? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is totally ignorant of him: If not <hi>ſaying in his Heart, There is no</hi> God, or that he <hi>ſitteth on the Circle of the Heavens, and humbleth</hi> not <hi>himſelf to behold the Things</hi> which are done on Earth: yet ſatisfying himſelf as well, to all <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean</hi> Intents and Purpoſes, by ſaying, "God is Merciful:" Confounding and ſwallowing up at once, in that unweildly Idea of Mercy, all his Holineſs and Eſſential Hatred of Sin, all his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Wiſdom and Truth. He is in no Dread
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028060_0163_0FD68B645BB2C648"/>of the Vengeance denounced againſt thoſe who obey not the bleſſed Law of God, becauſe he underſtands it not. He imagines the main Point is, To <hi>do thus,</hi> to be <hi>outwardly</hi> blameleſs: And ſees not that it extends to every Temper, Deſire, Thought, Motion of the Heart. Or he fancies, that the Obligation hereto is ceaſed; that Chriſt came to <hi>deſtroy the Law and the Prophets;</hi> to ſave his People, <hi>in,</hi> not <hi>from</hi> their Sins; to bring them to Heaven, without Holineſs. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his own Words, <hi>Not one Jot or Tittle of the Law ſhall paſs away, till all Things are fulfilled:</hi> And, <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord! ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is ſecure, becauſe he is utterly ignorant of himſelf. Hence he talks of "repenting by and by," he does not indeed exactly know when; but ſome time or other before he dies: Taking it for granted, That this is quite in his own Power. For what ſhould hinder his doing it, if he will? If he does but once ſet a Reſolution, no fear but he will make it good.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But this Ignorance never ſo ſtrongly glares, as in thoſe who are termed, <hi>Men of Learning,</hi> If a Natural Man be one of theſe, he can talk at large of his Rational Faculties; of the Freedom of his Will, and the abſolute Neceſſity of ſuch Freedom, in order to conſtitute a Man a Moral Agent. He reads and argues, and proves to a Demonſtration, That every Man may do as he will; may diſpoſe his own Heart to Evil or Good, as it ſeems beſt in his own Eyes. Thus the God of this World ſpreads a double Veil of Blindneſs

                  <p n="5">5. From the ſame Ignorance of himſelf and God there may ſometimes ariſe in the Natural Man, a kind of <hi>Joy,</hi> in congratulating himſelf, upon his own Wiſdom and Goodneſs. And what the World calls Joy, he may often poſſeſs. He may have Pleaſure in various Kinds; either in gratifying the Deſires of the Fleſh, or the Deſire of the Eye, or the Pride of Life: Particularly if he has large Poſſeſſions; if he enjoy an affluent Fortune. Then he may <hi>cloath</hi> himſelf <hi>in Purple and fine Linen, and fare ſumptuouſly every Day.</hi> And <hi>ſo long as</hi> he thus <hi>doth well unto himſelf, Men will</hi> doubtleſs <hi>ſpeak good of</hi> him. They will ſay, He is a happy Man: For indeed this is the Sum of Wordly Happineſs: To dreſs, and viſit, and talk, and eat, and drink, and riſe up to play.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is not ſurpriſing, if one in ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as theſe, dozed with the Opiates of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Sin, ſhould imagine, among his other waking Dreams, That he walks in great <hi>Liberty.</hi> How eaſily may he perſuade himſelf, that he is at Liberty from all <hi>Vulgar Errors,</hi> and from the <hi>Prejudice</hi> of Education, judging exactly right, and keeping clear of all Extremes. "I am free (may he ſay) from all the <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> of weak and narrow Souls: From <hi>Superſtition,</hi> the Diſeaſe of Fools and Cowards, always righteous over much; and from <hi>Bigotry,</hi> continually incident to thoſe who have not a free and generous Way of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." And too ſure it is, That he is altogether free, from the <hi>Wiſdom which cometh from Above,</hi> from Holineſs, from the Religion of the Heart, from the whole Mind which was in Chriſt.</p>

7. For all this Time, he is the Servant of Sin. He commits Sin, more or leſs Day by Day. Yet he is not troubled: He "is in no Bondage;" (as ſome ſpeak) he feels no Condemnation. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf, (even tho' he ſhould profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Chriſtian Revelation is of God?) with, "Man is frail. We are all weak. Every Man has his Infirmity." Perhaps he quotes Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: "Why, does not <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, "Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If at any Time a ſerious Thought fixes upon him, he ſtifles it as ſoon as poſſible, with, "Why ſhould I fear, ſince God is merciful, and Chriſt died for Sinners?" Thus he remains a willing Servant of Sin, content with the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Corruption; inwardly and outwardly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, and ſatisfied therewith; not only not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Sin, but not ſtriving to conquer, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly That Sin, which doth ſo eaſily beſet him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Such is the State of every <hi>Natural Man;</hi> whether he be a groſs, ſcandalous Tranſgreſſor, or a more reputable and decent Sinner, having the Form, tho' not the Power of Godlineſs. But how can ſuch an one be <hi>convinced of Sin?</hi> How is he brought to <hi>repent?</hi> To be <hi>under the Law?</hi> To receive the <hi>Spirit of Bondage unto Fear?</hi> This is the Point which is next to be conſidered.</p>

IV. 1. From this plain account of the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold State of Man, the <hi>Natural,</hi> the <hi>Legal,</hi> and the <hi>Evangelical,</hi> it appears, that it is not ſufficient, to divide Mankind, into Sincere and Inſincere. A Man may be ſincere in any of theſe States; not only when he has the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> but while he has the <hi>Spirit of Bondage unto Fear.</hi> Yea, while he has neither this Fear, nor Love. For undoubtedly there may be ſincere Heathens, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell as ſincere <hi>Jews</hi> or Chriſtians. This Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance then, does by no means prove, that a Man is in a State of Acceptance with God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Examine yourſelves</hi> therefore, not only whether ye are ſincere, <hi>but whether ye be in the Faith.</hi> Examine narrowly; for it imports you much. What is the ruling Principle in your Soul? Is it the Love of God? Is it the Fear of God? Or is it neither one nor the other? Is it not rather, the Love of the World? the Love of Pleaſure? or Gain? of Eaſe, or Reputation? if ſo, you are not come ſo far as a <hi>Jew.</hi> You are but a <hi>Heathen</hi> ſtill. Have you Heaven in your Heart? Have you the Spirit of Adoption, ever crying, <hi>Abba, Father?</hi> Or do you cry unto God, as <hi>out of the Belly of Hell,</hi> overwhelmed with Sorrow and Fear? Or are you a Stranger to this whole Affair, and cannot imagine what I mean? Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, pull off the Maſk. Thou haſt never put on Chriſt. Stand barefaced. Look up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And own before Him that liveth for e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> and ever, thou haſt no Part either among the Sons or Servants of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="unknown:028060_0177_0FD68B8863F903D0"/>
Whoſoever thou art, Doſt thou commit Sin, or doſt thou not? If thou doſt, is it willingly or unwillingly? In either caſe God hath told thee whoſe thou art, <hi>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil.</hi> If thou committeſt it willingly, thou art his Faithful Servant. He will not fail to reward thy Labour. If unwillingly, ſtill thou art his Servant. God deliver thee out of his Hands!</p>
                  <p>Art thou daily fighting againſt all Sin? and daily more than Conqueror? I acknowledge thee for a Child of God. O ſtand faſt in thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liberty. Art thou fighting, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering; ſtriving for the Maſtery, but not able to attain? Then thou art not yet a Believer in Chriſt; but follow on; and thou ſhalt know the Lord. Art thou not fighting at all, but leading an eaſy, indolent, faſhionable Life? O how haſt thou dared to Name the Name of Chriſt? Only to make it a Reproach among the Heathen? Awake thou Sleeper! Call upon thy God: Before the Deep ſwallow thee up.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Perhaps one Reaſon why ſo many think of themſelves more highly than they ought to think, why they do not diſcern what State they are in, is, becauſe theſe ſeveral States of Soul, are often mingled together, and in ſome Meaſure meet, in one and the ſame Perſon. Thus Experience ſhews, that the legal State, or State of Fear, is frequently mixt with the Natural. For few Men are ſo faſt aſleep in Sin, but they are ſometimes, more or leſs awakened. As the Spirit of God does not <hi>wait for the Call of Man,</hi> ſo at ſome times he <hi>will</hi> be heard. He puts them in Fear, ſo that for a Seaſon, at leaſt, the Heathen <hi>know
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028060_0178_0FD68B8B930FBAF0"/>themſelves to be but Men.</hi> They feel the Burthen of Sin, and earneſtly deſire to flee from the Wrath to come. But not long. They ſeldom ſuffer the Arrows of Conviction to go deep into their Souls; but quickly ſtifle the Grace of God, and return to their Wallowing in the Mire.</p>
                  <p>In like Manner, the Evangelical State, or State of Love, is frequently mixt with the Legal. For few of thoſe who have the Spirit of Bondage and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear, remain always without Hope. The wiſe and gracious God rarely ſuffers this; for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membereth that we are but Duſt. And he willeth not that <hi>the Fleſh ſhould fail before him, or the Spirit which he hath made.</hi> Therefore at ſuch Times as he ſeeth Good, he gives a Dawning of Light unto them that ſit in Darkneſs. He cauſes a Part of his Goodneſs to paſs before them, and ſhews he is a God <hi>that heareth the Prayer.</hi> They ſee the Promiſe which is by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, tho' it yet be afar off: And hereby they are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to <hi>run with Patience the Race which is ſet before them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Reaſon why many deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is becauſe they do not conſider, how far a Man may go, and yet be in a Natural, or at beſt a Legal State. A Man may be of a compaſſionate and a benevolent Temper, he may be affable, courteous, generous, friendly; he may have ſome Degree of Meekneſs, Patience, Temperance, and of many other moral Virtues. He may feel many Deſires of ſhaking off all Vice, and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing higher Degrees of Virtue. He may abſtain from much Evil; perhaps from all that is groſly contrary to Juſtice, Mercy or Truth. He may do much Good, may feed the Hungry, cloath the
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028060_0179_0FD68B8CD6C31E30"/>Naked, relieve the Widow and Fatherleſs. He may attend Public Worſhip, uſe Prayer in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, read many Books of Devotion: And yet for all this, he may be a mere Natural Man, knowing neither himſelf nor God; equally a Stranger to the Spirit of Fear and to that of Love; having neither repented nor believed the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe there were added to all this, a deep Conviction of Sin, with much Fear of the Wrath of God; vehement Deſires to eaſt off every Sin, and to fulfil all Righteouſneſs; frequent rejoicing in Hope, and Touches of Love often glancing upon the Soul: Yet neither do theſe prove a Man to be <hi>under Grace,</hi> to have True, Living, Chriſtian Faith, unleſs the Spirit of Adoption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in his Heart, unleſs he can continually cry, Abba, Father!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Beware then, thou who art called by the Name of Chriſt, that thou come not ſhort of the Mark of thy high Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="4">4. It is highly probable, there never were any Children of God, from the Beginning of the World unto this Day, who were farther advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Grace of God, and the Knowledge of
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028060_0186_0FD68B9E1C80A568"/>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, than the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> at the Time when he wrote theſe Words, and the <hi>Fathers in Chriſt</hi> to whom he wrote. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, it is evident, both the Apoſtle himſelf, and all thoſe Pillars in God's Temple, were very far from deſpiſing theſe Marks, of their being the Children of God; and that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them to their own Souls, for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their Faith. Yet all this is no other than rational Evidence; the <hi>Witneſs of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> or Reaſon or Underſtanding. It all reſolves into this: Thoſe who have theſe Marks, they are the Children of God. But we have theſe Marks: Therefore we are Children of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But how does it appear that we have theſe Marks? This is a queſtion which ſtill remains. How does it appear, that we do love God and our Neighbour? And that we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? Obſerve, that the Meaning of the Queſtion is, How does it appear to <hi>ourſelves?</hi> (not to <hi>others.</hi>) I would aſk him then that propoſes this Queſtion, How does it appear to you, That you are alive? And that you are now in Eaſe and not in Pain? Are you not immediately conſcious of it? By the ſame immediate Conſciouſneſs you will know, if your Soul is alive to God: If you are ſaved from the Pain of proud Wrath, and have the Eaſe of a meek and quiet Spirit. By the ſame Means you cannot but perceive, if you love, rejoice, and delight in God. By the ſame, you muſt be directly aſſured, if you love your Neighbour as yourſelf; if you are kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection'd to all Mankind, and full of Gentleneſs and Long-Suffering. And with regard to the Outward Mark of the Children of God, which
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028060_0187_0FD68B9FBA93F8C0"/>is (according to St. <hi>John</hi>) the keeping his Commandments, You undoubtedly know in your own Breaſt, if, by the Grace of God, it belongs to you.

Now this is properly the <hi>Teſtimony of our own Spirit;</hi> even the Teſtimony of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that God hath given us to be holy of Heart, and holy in outward Converſation. It is a Conſciouſneſs of our having received, in and by the Spirit of Adoption, the Tempers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Word of God, as belonging to his adopted Children: Even, a loving Heart toward God and toward all Mankind, hanging with child-like Confidence on God our Father, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but him, caſting all our Care upon him, and embracing every Child of Man, with earneſt tender affection; ſo as to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  <p n="7">7. But what is that Teſtimony of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is ſuper-added to and conjoined with
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:028060_0188_0FD68BA7B85B2F60"/>this? How does he <hi>bear witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of GOD.</hi> It is hard to find Words in the Language of Men, to explain <hi>the deep Things of GOD.</hi> Indeed there are none that will adequately expreſs, what the Children of God experience. But perhaps one might ſay (deſiring any who are taught of God, to correct, to ſoften or Strengthen the Expreſſion.) The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Spirit, is an inward Impreſſion on the Soul, whereby the Spirit of God directly <hi>witneſſes to my Spirit, That I am a Child of GOD;</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt hath loved me, and given himſelf for me: That all my Sins are blotted out, and I, even I, am reconciled to God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That this <hi>Teſtimony of the Spirit of GOD</hi> muſt needs, in the very Nature of Things, be antecedent to the <hi>Teſtimony of our own Spirit,</hi> may appear from this ſingle Conſideration. We muſt be holy of Heart and holy in Life, before we can be conſcious that we are ſo; before we can have <hi>the Teſtimony of our Spirit,</hi> that we are inwardly and outwardly Holy. But we muſt love God, before we can be holy at all; this being the Root of all Holineſs. Now we cannot love God, till we know he loves us. <hi>We love Him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> And we cannot know his Pardoning Love to us, till his Spirit witneſſes it to our Spirit. Since therefore this <hi>Teſtimony of his Spirit</hi> muſt precede the Love of God and all Holineſs, of Conſequence it muſt precede our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conſciouſneſs thereof, or, the <hi>Teſtimony of our Spirit</hi> concerning them.</p>

9. Then, and not till then, when the Spirit of God beareth that Witneſs to our Spirit, "God hath loved thee, and given his own Son to be the Propitiation for thy Sins; the Son of God hath loved thee, and hath waſhed thee from thy Sins in his Blood:" <hi>We love</hi> God, <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> and for his Sake we <hi>love our Brother alſo.</hi> And of this we cannot but be conſcious to ourſelves: We <hi>know the Things that are freely given to us of</hi> God. We know that we love God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And <hi>hereby alſo we know that we are of</hi> God. This is that Teſtimony of our own Spirit; which, ſo long as we continue to love God and keep his Commandments, continues joined with the Teſtimony of God's Spirit, <hi>that we are the Children of</hi> God.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Not that I would, by any means, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by any Thing which has been ſpoken concerning it, to exclude the Operation of the Spirit of God, even from the <hi>Teſtimony of our own Spirit.</hi> In no wiſe. It is he that not only worketh in us every Manner of Thing that is good, but alſo ſhines upon his own Work, and clearly ſhews what he has wrought. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as one great End of our receiving the Spirit, <hi>That we may know the Things which are freely given to us of</hi> God: that he may ſtrengthen the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, touching our <hi>Simplicity and Godly Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> and give us to diſcern in a fuller and ſtronger Light, that we now do the Things which pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Should it ſtill be enquired, How does the Spirit of God, <hi>bear Witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of</hi> God, ſo as to exclude all
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028060_0190_0FD68BAA1BC1C620"/>Doubt, and evince the Reality of our Sonſhip? The anſwer is clear, from what has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above. And firſt, as to the Witneſs of our Spirit. The Soul as intimately and evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, when it loves, delights, and rejoices in God, as when it loves and delights in any Thing on Earth. And it can no more doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it loves, delights and rejoices, or no, than whether it exiſts, or no. If therefore this be juſt Reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>He that now loves God, that delights and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices in him, with an humble Joy, an holy Delight, and an obedient Love, is a Child of God:</p>
                  <p>But I thus love, delight, and rejoice in God;</p>
                  <p>Therefore I am a Child of God: Then a Chriſtian can in no wiſe doubt, of his being a Child of God. Of the Former Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he has as full an Aſſurance, as he has that the Scriptures are of God. And of his thus loving God, he has an Inward Proof, which is nothing ſhort of Self-evidence. Thus the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our own Spirit</hi> is with the moſt intimate Conviction manifeſted to our Hearts; in ſuch a Manner, as beyond all reaſonable Doubt, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Reality of our Sonſhip.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The <hi>Manner</hi> how the Divine Teſtimony is manifeſted to the Heart, I do not take upon me to explain. <hi>Such Knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me; I cannot attain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

How this joint Teſtimony of God's Spirit and our Spirit, may be clearly and ſolidly diſtinguiſhed, from the Preſumption of a natural Mind, and from the Deluſion of the Devil, is the next Thing to be conſidered. And it highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports all who deſire the Salvation of God, to conſider it with the deepeſt Attention, as they would not deceive their own Souls.

And hence, it is in no wiſe ſtrange if one who is vainly puffed up by his fleſhy Mind, when he hears of this Privilege of true Chriſtians, among whom he undoubtedly ranks himſelf, ſhould ſoon work himſelf up into a Perſuaſion, that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready poſſeſt thereof. Such Inſtances now abound in the World, and have abounded in all Ages. How then may the real Teſtimony of the Spirit with our Spirit, be diſtinguiſhed from this damning Preſumption?</p>

<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028060_0193_0FD68BB403CDB1A0"/>of Sins to all of them, who with hearty Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and true Faith return unto him." But he is a Stranger even to this Repentance. He hath never known <hi>a broken and a contrite Heart. The Remembrance of</hi> his <hi>Sins</hi> was never <hi>grievous unto</hi> him, nor <hi>the Burthen of them intolerable.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating thoſe Words, he never meant what he ſaid; he merely paid a Compliment to God. And were it only from the Want of this previous Work of God, he hath too great Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he hath graſped a mere Shadow, and never yet known the real Privilege of the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again, the Scriptures deſcribe the being born of God, which muſt precede the Witneſs that we are his Children, as a vaſt and mighty Change, a Change <hi>from Darkneſs to Light,</hi> as well as <hi>from the Power of Satan unto</hi> God: As a <hi>paſſing from Death unto Life,</hi> a Reſurrection from the Dead. Thus the Apoſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians; You hath he quickened who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> Chap. ii. ver. 1. And again, <hi>When we were dead in Sins, he hath quickened us together with Chriſt; and hath raiſed us up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made us ſit together, in heavenly Places, in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ver. 5.6. But what knoweth he, concerning whom we now ſpeak, of any ſuch Change as this? He is altogether unacquainted with this whole Matter. This is a Language which he does not underſtand. He tells you, "He always was a Chriſtian. He knows no Time when he had need of ſuch a Change." By this alſo, if he give himſelf leave to think, may he know, that he is not born of the Spirit: That he has never yet known God; but has miſtaken the Voice of Nature for the Voice of God.</p>

6. But waving the Conſideration of whatever he has or has not experienced in Time paſt; by the preſent Marks may we eaſily diſtinguiſh a Child of God, from a preſumptuous Self-deceiver. The Scriptures deſcribe that Joy in the Lord which accompanies the Witneſs of his Spirit, as an humble Joy, a Joy that abaſes to the Duſt; that makes a pardon'd Sinner cry out, "I am vile! What am I, or my Father's Houſe?—Now mine Eye ſeeth thee, I abhor myſelf in Duſt and Aſhes!" And wherever Lowlineſs is, there is Meekneſs, Patience, Gentleneſs, Long-ſuffering, There is a ſoft, yielding Spirit; a Mildneſs and Sweetneſs: a Tenderneſs of Soul which Words canno expreſs. But do theſe Fruits attend that <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Teſtimony of the Spirit, in a Preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man? Juſt the Reverſe. The more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he is of the Favour of God, the more is he lifted up. The more does he exalt himſelf; the more haughty and aſſuming is his whole Behaviour. The ſtronger Witneſs he imagines himſelf to have, the more overbearing is he to all around him; the more incapable of receiving any Reproof, the more impatient of Contradiction. Inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more meek, and gentle, and teachable, more <hi>ſwift to hear, and ſlow to ſpeak,</hi> he is more ſlow to hear and ſwift to ſpeak, more unready to learn of any one; more fiery and vehement in his Temper, and eager in his Converſation. Yea, perhaps, there will ſometimes appear a Kind of Fierceneſs in his Air, his Manner of Speaking, his whole Deportment, as if he were juſt going to take the Matter out of God's Hands, and himſelf to <hi>devour the Adverſaries.</hi>

7. Once more. The Scriptures teach, <hi>this is the Love of</hi> God (the ſure Mark thereof) <hi>that we keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> ver. 3. And our Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>he that keepeth my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, he it is that loveth me John</hi> xiv. 21. Love rejoices to obey; to do n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But is this the Character of the preſumptuous Pretender to the Love of God? Nay, but his Love gives him a Liberty to diſobey, to break, not keep, the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. Perhaps when he was in Fear of the Wrath of God, the did labour to do his Will. But now looking on himſelf as <hi>not under the Law,</hi> he thinks he is no longer obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. He is therefore leſs zealous of good Works, leſs careful to abſtain from Evil; leſs watchful over his own Heart, leſs jealous over his Tongue.

<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028060_0196_0FD68BB860C2B030"/>Witneſs to a lie; or teſtify that he is a Child of God, when he is manifeſtly a Child of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Diſcover thyſelf, thou poor Self-deceiver! Thou who art confident of being a Child of God, thou who ſayeſt, "I have the Witneſs in myſelf," and therefore defieſt all thy Enemies. Thou art weighed in the Balance and found wanting; even in the Balance of the Sanctuary. The Word of the Lord hath tried thy Soul, and proved thee to be reprobate Silver. Thou art not lowly of Heart. Therefore thou haſt not received the Spirit of Jeſus unto this Day. Thou art not gentle and meek; therefore thy Joy is nothing worth: It is not Joy in the Lord. Thou doſt not keep his Commandments; therefore thou loveſt him not, neither art thou Partaker of the Holy Ghoſt. It is conſequently, as certain and as evident, as the Oracles of God can make it, his Spirit doth not bear Witneſs with thy Spirit, that thou art a Child of God. O cry unto him that the Seales may fall off thine Eyes, that thou mayeſt know thyſelf as thou art known; that thou mayeſt receive the Sentence of Death in thyſelf, till thou hear the Voice that raiſes the Dead, ſaying, "be of good Cheer: Thy Sins are forgiven; thy Faith hath made thee whole."</p>

And yet doubtleſs the Moment he heard that Voice, he knew it was the Voice of God. But <hi>how</hi> he knew this who is able to explain? Perhaps neither Man nor Angel.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To come yet cloſer. Suppoſe God were now to ſpeak to any Soul, "Thy Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee."

In this I likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, yea and will rejoice, becauſe my Conſcience beareth me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt, by the Light he continually pours in upon it, that I <hi>walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith</hi> I am <hi>called;</hi> that I <hi>abſtain from all Appearance of Evil, fleeing from Sin as from the Face of a Serpent;</hi> that as I have Opportunity, I do all poſſible Good, in every kind, to all Men; that I follow my Lord in all my Steps, and do what is acceptable in his ſight. I rejoice becauſe I both ſee and feel, through the Inſpiration of God's Holy Spirit, that all my Works are wrought in him, yea and that it is he who worketh all my Works in me. I rejoice in ſeeing, thro' the Light of God which ſhines in my Heart, that I have Power to walk in his Ways, and that thro' his Grace, I turn not therefrom, to the Right Hand or to the Left.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Such is the Ground and the Nature of that Joy, whereby a Chriſtian rejoiceth ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And from all this we may eaſily infer, Firſt. That this is not a <hi>natural</hi> Joy. It does
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:028060_0213_0FD68BDDD333BDB0"/>not ariſe from any natural Cauſe: Not from any ſudden Flow of Spirits. This may give a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Start of Joy. But the Chriſtian <hi>rejoiceth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</hi> It cannot be owing to bodily Health or Eaſe; to Strength and Soundneſs of Conſtitution. For it is equally ſtrong in Sickneſs and Pain; yea perhaps far ſtronger than before. Many Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have never experienced any Joy, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that which then ſilled their Soul, when the Body was well nigh worn out with Pain, or conſumed away with pining Sickneſs. Leaſt of all can it be aſcribed to outward Proſperity, to the Favour of Men, or Plenty of worldly Goods. For then chiefly, when their Faith has been tried as with Fire, by all Manner of outward Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have the Children of God rejoiced in him, <hi>whom unſeen they loved,</hi> even <hi>with Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable.</hi> And never ſurely did Men rejoice like thoſe, who were uſed as <hi>the Filth and off ſcouring of the World;</hi> who wandered to and two, being in want of all Things; in Hunger, in Cold, in Nakedneſs: Who <hi>had Trials,</hi> not only <hi>of cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. From the preceding Conſiderations, we may, Secondly, infer, That the Joy of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian does not ariſe from any <hi>Blindneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> from his not being able to diſcern Good from Evil. So far from it, that he was an utter Stranger to this Joy, till the Eyes of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were opened! that he knew it not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had Spiritual Senſes, fitted to diſcern ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Good and Evil. And now the Eye of his
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028060_0214_0FD68BDFC9F41880"/>Soul waxeth not dim. He was never ſo ſharp-ſighted before. He has ſo quick a Perception of the ſmalleſt Things, as is quite amazing to the natural Man. As a Mote is viſible in the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam, ſo to him who is walking in the Light, in the Beams of the uncreated Sun, every Mote of Sin is viſible. Nor does he cloſe the Eyes of his Conſcience any more. That Sleep is departed from him. His Soul is always bread awake; No more Slumber or folding of the Hands to Reſt! He is always ſtanding on the Tower, and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what his Lord will ſay concerning him: And always rejoicing in this very Thing, in <hi>ſeeing him that is inviſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. Neither does the Joy of a Chriſtian ariſe, Thirdly, from any <hi>Dulneſs</hi> or <hi>Callouſneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> A Kind of Joy, it is true, may ariſe from this, in thoſe whoſe <hi>fooliſh Hearts are darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> whoſe Heart is callous, unfeeling, dull of Senſe; and conſequently, without ſpiritual Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Becauſe of their ſenſeleſs, unſeeling Hearts, they may rejoice even in committing Sin: And this they may probably call <hi>Liberty!</hi> Which is indeed more Drunkenneſs of Soul: A fatal Numbneſs of Spirit, the ſtupid Inſenſibility of a ſeared Conſcience. On the contrary, a Chriſtian has the moſt exquiſite Senſibility; ſuch as he could not have conceived before. He never had ſuch a Tenderneſs of Conſcience as he has had, ſince the Love of God has reigned in his Heart. And this alſo is his Glory and Joy; that God hath heard his daily Prayer,

                        <l>"O that my tender Soul might fly</l>

20. To conclude. Chriſtian Joy, is Joy in Obedience: Joy in loving God and keeping his Commandments. And yet not in keeping them, as if we were thereby to fulfil the Terms of the <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> as if by any Works or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of ours, we were to <hi>procure</hi> Pardon and Acceptance with God. Not ſo: We are already pardoned and accepted, thro' the Mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus—Not as if we were by our own Obedience to <hi>procure</hi> Life, Life from the Death of Sin. This alſo we have already thro' the Grace of God. <hi>Us hath he quickened, who were dead in Sin.</hi> And now we are <hi>alive to</hi> God, <hi>thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> But we rejoice in knowing, That <hi>being juſtified thro' his Grace,</hi> we have <hi>not received that Grace of</hi> God <hi>in vain;</hi> That God having freely (not for the Sake of our willing or running, but through the Blood of the Lamb) reconciled us to himſelf, we run in the Strength which he hath given us, the Way of his Commandments. He hath <hi>girded us with Strength unto the War,</hi> and we gladly <hi>fight the good Fight of Faith.</hi> We rejoice, thro' him who liveth in our Hearts by Faith, to <hi>lay hold of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi> This is our Rejoicing: that as our <hi>Father worketh hitherto,</hi> ſo (not by our own Might or Wiſdom, but through the Power of his Spirit freely given in Chriſt Jeſus) we alſo work the Works of God. And may he work in us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is well-pleaſing in his Sight! To whom be the Praiſe for ever and ever!</p>

                     </gap> being agreed, that Chriſt had ordained certain outward Means, for conveying his Grace into the Souls of Men.

                  <p n="2">2. But in Proceſs of time, when <hi>the Love of many waxed cold,</hi> ſome began to miſtake the <hi>Means</hi> for the <hi>End,</hi> and to place Religion, rather in doing thoſe outward Works, than in a Heart renewed after the Image of God. They forgot, that <hi>the End of</hi> every <hi>Commandment is Love, out of a pure Heart, with Faith unfeigned:</hi> The
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:028060_0218_0FD68BE914C60DE0"/>loving the Lord their God with all their Heart, and their Neighbour as themſelves; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purified from Pride, Anger, and evil Deſires, by a <hi>Faith of the Operation of</hi> God.

                     </gap>o the End for which they were ordained. Rather, the Things which ſhould have been for their Health, were to them an Occaſion of falling. They were ſo far from receiving any Bleſſing therein, that they only drew down a Curſe upon their Head: ſo far from growing more heavenly in Heart and Life, that they were twofold more the Children of Hell than before. Others clearly perceiving, that theſe Means did not convey the Grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> God to thoſe Children of the Devil, began from this particular Caſe to draw a General Concluſion, "That they were not Means of conveying the Grace of God."</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet the Number of thoſe who <hi>abuſed</hi> the Ordinances of God, was far greater than of thoſe who <hi>deſpiſed</hi> them, till certain Men aroſe, not only or great underſtanding, (ſometimes joined with conſiderable Learning) but who likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be Men of Love, experimentally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with true, Inward Religion. Some of theſe were burning and ſhining Lights, Perſons famous in their Generations, and ſuch as had

                  <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed, that theſe holy and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Men, intended any more at firſt, than to ſhew that Outward Religion is nothing worth, without the Religion of the Heart: That God <hi>is a Spirit, and they who worſhip him, muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him in Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>it and in Truth:</hi> That therefore external Worſhip is loſt Labour, withou a Heart devoted to God: That the Outward Ordinances of God then profit much, when they advance Inward Holineſs, but when they advance it not, are unprofitable and void, are lighter than Vanity: Yea, that when they are uſed, as it were, <hi>in the Place</hi> of This, they are an utter Abomination to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet it is not ſtrange, if ſome of theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrongly convinced, of that horrid Proſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ordinances of God, which had ſpread itſelf over the whole Church, and well nigh driven True Religion out of the World; in their fervent Zeal for the Glory of God, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Souls; from that fatal Deluſion, ſpake as if Outward Religion were <hi>abſolutely nothing,</hi> as if it had <hi>no</hi> Place in the Religion of Chriſt. It is not ſurprizing at all, if they ſhould not always have expreſſed themſelves with ſufficent Caution. So that unwary Hearers might believe, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all Outward Means, as altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable; and as not deſigned of God to be the Ordinary Channels of conveying his Grace into the Souls of Men.</p>
                  <p>Nay, it is not impoſſible, ſome of theſe holy Men did at length themſelves fall into this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:028060_0220_0FD68BF0F0C2CDA8"/>In particular, thoſe who, not by Choice, but by the Providence of God, were out off from all theſe Ordinances: Perhaps wandering up and down, having no certain Abiding-place, or dwelling in Dens and Caves of the Earth. Theſe experiencing the Grace of God in themſelves, tho' they were deprived of all Outward Means, might infer, that the ſame Grace would be given to them, who of ſet Purpoſe abſtained from them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And Experience ſhews, how eaſily this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpreads, and inſinuates itſelf into the Minds of Men: Eſpecially of thoſe who are thoroughly awakened out of the Sleep of Death, and begin to feel the Weight of their Sins, a Burthen too heavy to be born. Theſe are uſually impatient of their preſent State, and trying every Way to eſcape from it. They are always ready to catch at any new Thing, any new Propoſal of Eaſe or Happineſs. They have probably tried moſt Outward Means, and found no Eaſe in Them: It may be, more and more of Remorſe and Fear, and Sorrow and Condemnation. It is eaſy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to perſuade theſe, That it is better for them to abſtain from all thoſe Means. They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready weary of ſtriving (as it ſeems) in vain, of labouring in the Fire: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="2">II. 1. In the following Diſcourſe, I propoſe to examine at large. Whether there are any Means of Grace?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="unknown:028060_0221_0FD68BF22321BE70"/>
By <hi>Means of Grace</hi> I underſtand, Outward Signs, Words or Actions, ordained of God, and appointed for this End, to be the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels whereby he might convey to Men, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, juſtifying or ſanctifying Grace.</p>
                  <p>I uſe this Expreſſion, "Means of Grace," be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know none better, and becauſe it has been generally uſed in the Chriſtian Church for many Ages: In particular, by our own Church, which directs us to bleſs God, both for the "<hi>Means of Grace</hi> and Hope of Glory;" and teaches us that a Sacrament is "An Outward Sign of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Grace,</hi> and a <hi>Means</hi> whereby we receive the ſame."</p>
                  <p>The Chief of theſe Means are Prayer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſecret, or with the great Congregation; ſearching the Scriptures (which implies Reading, Hearing and meditating thereon) and receiving the Lord's Supper, eating Bread and drinking Wine in Remembrance of him; and theſe we believe to be ordained of God, as the ordinary Channels of conveying his Grace to the Souls of Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But we allow, That the whole Value of the Means depends on their actual Subſervience to the End of Religion; that conſequently all theſe Means, when ſeparate from the End, are leſs than Nothing and Vanity; That if they do not actually conduce to the Knowledge and Love of God, they are not acceptable in his Sight; yea, rather, they are an Abomination before him; a Stink in his Noſtrils; he is weary to bear them, Above all, if they are uſed as a kind of <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> for the Religion they were deſigned to ſubſerve. It is not eaſy to find Words for the
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:028060_0222_0FD68BF40EECB978"/>enormous Folly and Wickedneſs, of thus turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Arms againſt himſelf; of keeping Chriſtianity out of the Heart by thoſe very Means, which were ordained for the bringing it in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We allow likewiſe, that all Outward Means whatever, if ſeparate from the Spirit of God, cannot profit at all, cannot conduce in any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree either to the Knowledge or Love of God. Without Controverſy, the Help that is done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, he doth it himſelf. It is He alone, who by his own Almighty Power, worketh in us what is pleaſing in his Sight. And all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Things, unleſs he work in them and by them, are mere weak and beggarly Elements. Whoſoever therefore imagines, there is any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic <hi>Power,</hi> in any Means whatſoever, does greatly err, not knowing the Scriptures, neither the Power of God. We know that there is no inherent Power, in the Words that are ſpoken in Prayer; in the Letter of Scripture read, the Sound thereof heard, or the Bread and Wine received in the Lord's Supper: But that it is God alone who is the Giver of every good Gift, the Author of all Grace; that the whole Power is of him whereby thro' any of theſe, there is any Bleſſing conveyed to our Soul. We know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that he is able to give the ſame Grace, tho' there were no Means on the Face of the Earth. In this Senſe we may affirm, that "with Regard to God, there is no ſuch Thing as Means:" Seeing he is equally able to work whatſoever pleaſeth him, by Any, or by None at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="239" facs="unknown:028060_0223_0FD68BF5313C4368"/>
4. We allow farther, That the Uſe of all Means whatever, will never atone for one Sin; That it is the Blood of Chriſt alone, whereby any Sinner can be reconciled to God; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other Propitiation for our Sins, no other Fountain for Sin and Uncleanneſs. Every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in Chriſt is deeply convinced, that there is no <hi>Merit,</hi> but in Him: That there is no <hi>Merit</hi> in any of his own Works; not in uttering the Prayer, or ſearching the Scripture, or hearing the Word of God, or eating of that Bread and drinking of that Cup. So that if no more be intended by the Expreſſion ſome have uſed, "Chriſt is the only Means of Grace," than this, That he is the only <hi>Meritorious Cauſe</hi> of it, it cannot be gain-ſaid by any who know the Grace of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet once more. We allow (tho' it is a melancholy Truth) that a large Proportion of thoſe who are called Chriſtians, do to this Day abuſe the Means of Grace, to the Deſtruction of their Souls. This is doubtleſs the Caſe with all thoſe who reſt content, in the Form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without the Power. Either they fondly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, they are Chriſtians already, becauſe they do thus and thus; altho' Chriſt was never yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in their Hearts, nor the Love of God ſhed abroad therein: Or elſe they ſuppoſe, They ſhall infallibly be ſo, barely becauſe they uſe theſe Means: Idly dreaming (tho' perhaps hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious thereof) either that there is ſome Kind of <hi>Power</hi> therein, whereby ſooner or later (they know not when) they ſhall certainly be made Holy: Or that there is a Sort of <hi>Merit</hi> in uſing
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:028060_0224_0FD68BF696987450"/>them, which will ſurely move God to give them Holineſs, or accept them without it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So little do they underſtand that great Foundation of the whole Chriſtian Building, <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved.</hi> Ye are ſaved from your Sins, from the Guilt and Power thereof, ye are reſtored to the Favour and Image of God, not for any Works, <hi>Merits</hi> or Deſervings of yours, but by the free <hi>Grace,</hi> the mere mercy of God, thro' the <hi>Merits</hi> of his well-beloved Son. Ye are thus ſaved, not by any <hi>Power,</hi> Wiſdom or Strength, which is in you, or in any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but merely thro' the Grace or <hi>Power</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, which worketh all in all.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But the main Queſtion remains. We know this Salvation is the Gift and the Work of God. But how (may one ſay, who is convinced he hath it not) may I attain thereto? If you ſay, "Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved:" He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, True; but how ſhall I believe? You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it upon God.—Well. But how am I to wait? In the Means of Grace, or out of them? Am I to wait for the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation, by uſing theſe Means, or by laying them aſide?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It cannot poſſibly be conceived, that the Word of God ſhould give no Direction in ſo important a Point: Or that the Son of God, who came down from Heaven for us Men and for our Salvation, ſhould have left us undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with regard to a Queſtion, wherein our Salvation is ſo nearly concerned.</p>
                  <p>And in Fact, he hath not leſt us undetermined; he hath ſhewn us the Way wherein we ſhould go. We have only to conſult the Oracles of

                  <p n="3">III. 1. According to this, according to the Deciſion of Holy Writ, all who deſire the Grace of God, are to wait for it, in the Means which he hath ordained; in uſing, not in laying them aſide.</p>
                  <p>And firſt: All who deſire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in the Way of <hi>Prayer.</hi> This is the expreſs Direction of our Lord himſelf. In his Sermon upon the Mount, after explaining at large wherein Religion conſiſts, and deſcribing the main Branches of it, he adds, <q>Aſk and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that aſketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened.</q> (<hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 7, 8.) Here we are in the plaineſt Manner directed to aſk, in order to, or as a <hi>Means</hi> of receiving; to ſeek in order to find, the Grace of God, the Pearl of great Price; and to knock, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue aſking and ſeeking, if we would enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That no Doubt might remain, our Lord labours this Point in a more peculiar Manner. He appeals to every Man's own Heart. <q>What Man is there of you, who if his Son aſk Bread, will give him a Stone? Or if he aſk a Fiſh, will he give him a Serpent? If ye then being evil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ow how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven,</q> the Father of Angels and Men, the Father of the
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:028060_0226_0FD68BFF9E908238"/>Spirits of all Fleſh, <hi>give good Things to them that aſk him?</hi> ver. 9, 10, 11. Or, as he expreſſes himſelf on another Occaſion, including all good things in one, <hi>How much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that aſk him? Luke</hi> xi. 13. It ſhould be particularly obſerved here, that the Perſons directed to aſk, had not then received the Holy Spirit. Nevertheleſs our Lord directs them to uſe this Means, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that it ſhould be effectual; that upon aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould receive the Holy Spirit, from him whoſe Mercy is over all his Works.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The abſolute Neceſſity of uſing this Means, if we would receive any Gift from God, yet farther appears from that remarkable Paſſage which immediately precedes theſe Words: <q>And he ſaid unto them</q> (whom he had juſt been teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how to pray) <q>which of you ſhall have a Friend, and ſhall go unto him at Midnight, and ſhall ſay unto him, Friend, lend me three Loaves— and he from within ſhall anſwer, Trouble me not —I cannot riſe and give thee: I ſay unto you, though he will not riſe and give him, becauſe he is his Friend, yet becauſe of his Importunity he will riſe, and give him as many as he needeth. And I ſay unto you, aſk and it ſhall be given you,</q> Luke xi. 5, 7, 8, 9. <q>Though he will not give him, becauſe he is his Friend, yet becauſe of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he will riſe and give him as many as he needeth.</q> How could our bleſſed Lord more plainly declare, That we may receive of God, by this Means, by importunately aſking, what otherwiſe we ſhould not receive at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="243" facs="unknown:028060_0227_0FD68BFFA470ACA0"/>
4. <hi>He ſpake alſo another Parable to this End, that Men ought always to pray, and not to faint,</hi> 'till through this Means they ſhould receive of God, whatſoever Petition they aſked of him. <q>There was in a city a Judge which feared not God, neither regarded Man. And there was a Widow in that City, and ſhe came unto him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Avenge me of my Adverſary. And he would not for a while; but afterwards he ſaid with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Though I fear not God, nor regard Man, yet becauſe this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her, leſt by her continual coming ſhe weary me.</q> Luke xviii 1—4. The Application of this our Lord himſelf hath made. <hi>Hear what the unjuſt Judge ſaith!</hi> Becauſe ſhe continues to aſk, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the will take no Denial, therefore I will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her. <hi>And ſhall not</hi> God <hi>avenge his own Elect, which cry Day and Night unto him? I tell you be will avenge them ſpeedily</hi>—if they <hi>pray and faint not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. A Direction equally full and expreſs, to wait for the Bleſſings of God in private Prayer, together with a poſitive Promiſe, that by this Means we ſhall obtain the Requeſt of our Lips, he hath given us in thoſe well-known Words: <q>Enter into thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy Door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly,</q> Matth. vi. 6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If it be poſſible for any Direction to be more clear, it is that which God hath given us by the Apoſtle, with regard to Prayer of every Kind, public or private, and the Bleſſings annext thereto. <hi>If any of you lack Wiſdom, let him aſk
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:028060_0228_0FD68C01151BC348"/>of</hi> God, <hi>that giveth to all Men liberally,</hi> (if they aſk; otherwiſe <hi>ye have not, becauſe ye aſk not,</hi> Jam. iv. 2.) <hi>and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him,</hi> ch. i. 5.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, "But this is no Direction to Unbelievers; to them who know not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace of God: For the Apoſtle adds, <hi>But let him aſk in Faith:</hi> otherwiſe, <hi>let him not think that he ſhall receive any Thing of the Lord."</hi> I anſwer, The Meaning of the Word <hi>Faith</hi> in this Place is fixed by the Apoſtle himſelf, (as if it were on purpoſe to obviate this Objection) in the Words immediately following: <hi>Let him aſk in Faith, nothing wavering,</hi> nothing <hi>doubting,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Not doubting but God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Prayer, and will fulfil the Deſire of his Heart.</p>
                  <p>The groſs, blaſphemous Abſurdity of ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Faith</hi> in this Place to be taken in the full Chriſtian Meaning, appears hence: It is ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt to direct a Man who knows he hath not this Faith, (which is here termed <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>) to aſk it of God, with a poſitive Promiſe that <hi>it ſhall be given him;</hi> and then immediately to ſubjoin, That it ſhall not be given him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he have it before he aſks for it! But who can bear ſuch a Suppoſition; from this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore, as well as thoſe cited above, we muſt infer, that all who deſire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in the Way of Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Secondly,</hi> All who deſire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in <hi>ſearching the Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Lord's Direction with regard to the Uſe of this Means, is likewiſe plain and clear. <hi>Search
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:028060_0229_0FD68C029A565710"/>the Scriptures,</hi> faith he to the unbelieving <hi>Jews, —for they teſtify of me,</hi> John v. 39. And for this very End did he direct them to ſearch the Scriptures, that they might <hi>believe in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Objection, "That this is not a Command, but only an Aſſertion, that they did ſearch the Scriptures," is ſhameleſly falſe. I deſire thoſe who urge it, to let us know, how a Command can be more clearly expreſſed, than in thoſe Terms, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. It is as peremptory as ſo many Words can make it.</p>
                  <p>And what a Bleſſing from God attends the Uſe of this Means, appears from what is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning the <hi>Bereans;</hi> who after hearing St. <hi>Paul, ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe Things were ſo? Therefore many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;</hi> found the Grace of God, in the Way which he had ordained. <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>It is probable, indeed, that in ſome of thoſe who had <hi>received the Word with all Readineſs of Mind, Faith came</hi> (as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>by hearing,</hi> and was only confirmed by <hi>reading</hi> the Scriptures. But it was obſerved above, that under the general Term of <hi>ſearching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> both Hearing, Reading, and Meditating, are contained.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And that this is a Means whereby God not only gives, but alſo confirms and increaſes true Wiſdom, we learn from the Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy: From a Child thou haſt known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2. Tim. iii. 15. The ſame Truth (namely, that this is the great Means God has ordained for
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:028060_0230_0FD68C0A5D6FA8E8"/>conveying his manifold Grace to Man) is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, in the fulleſt Manner that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in the Words which immediately follow: <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of</hi> God; (conſequently, all Scripture is infallibly true;) <hi>and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs: To the End that the Man of GOD may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works,</hi> ver. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It ſhould be obſerved, that this is ſpoken primarily and directly, of the Scriptures which <hi>Timothy</hi> had <hi>known from a Child;</hi> which muſt have been thoſe of the Old Teſtament, for the New was not then wrote. How far then was St. <hi>Paul</hi> (though he was <hi>not a whit behind the very Chief of the Apoſtles,</hi> not therefore, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, behind any Man now upon Earth) from making light of the Old Teſtament! Behold this, leſt ye one Day <hi>wonder and periſh,</hi> ye who make ſo ſmall Account of one Half of the Oracles of God! Yea, and that Half of which the Holy Ghoſt expreſsly declares, That it is <hi>profitable,</hi> as a Means ordained of God, for this very Thing, <hi>for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in Righteouſneſs: To the End the Man of GOD may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Nor is this proſitable only for the Men of God, for thoſe who walk already in the Light of his Countenance; but alſo for thoſe who are yet in Darkneſs, ſeeking him whom they know not. Thus St. <hi>Peter, We have alſo a more ſure Word of Prophecy:</hi> (Literally, <hi>and we

Let all, therefore, who deſire that Day to dawn upon their Hearts, wait for it in <hi>ſearching the Scriptures.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All who deſire an Increaſe of the Grace of God, are to wait for it in partaking of the Lord's Supper. For this alſo is a Direction himſelf hath given. <q>The ſame Night in which he was betrayed, he took Bread, and brake it, and ſaid, Take, eat:</q> This is my Body (that is, the ſacred Sign of my Body) <q>This do in Remembrance of me. Likewiſe, he took the Cup, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament, or <hi>Covenant,</hi> in my Blood, (the ſacred ſign of that Covenant) this do ye, in Remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lord's Death till he come,</q> 2 Cor. xi. 23, &amp;c. Ye openly exhibit the ſame, by theſe viſible Signs, before God, and Angels, and Men. Ye manifeſt your ſolemn Remembrance of his Death, till he cometh in the Clouds of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Only <hi>let a Man</hi> firſt <hi>examine himſelf,</hi> whether he underſtands the Nature and Deſign of this holy Inſtitution, and whether he really deſire to be himſelf made conformable to the Death of

                  <p>Here then the Direction firſt given by our Lord, is expreſly repeated by the Apoſtle. Let him eat; let him drink: (<gap reason="foreign">

Words not implying a bare Permiſſion only, but a clear explicit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; a Command to all thoſe, either who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready are filled with Peace and Joy in believing, or who can truly ſay, "The Remembrance of our Sins is grievous unto us, the Burden of them is intolerable."</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And that this is alſo an ordinary ſtated Means of receiving the Grace of God, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, which occur in the preceding Chapter. <q>The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion, <hi>or Communication,</hi> of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</q> (1 Cor. x. 16.) Is not the eating of that Bread, and the drinking of that Cup, the outward, viſible Means, whereby God conveys into our Souls all that Spiritual Grace, that Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, which were purchaſed by the Body of Chriſt once broken, and the Blood of Chriſt once ſhed for us? Let all, therefore, who truly deſire the Grace of God, eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="unknown:028060_0233_0FD68C0F68061030"/>wiſe in their own Eyes, have from Time to Time raiſed againſt it. It may be needful to conſider a few of theſe; not becauſe they are of Weight in themſelves, but becauſe they have ſo often been uſed, eſpecially of late Years, to turn the Lame out of the Way; yea, to trouble and ſubvert thoſe who did run well, till Satan appeared as an Angel of Light.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and Chief of theſe is, "You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe theſe Means (as you call them) without <hi>truſting</hi> in them." I pray, where is this written? I expect you ſhould ſhew me plain Scripture for your Aſſertion. Otherwiſe I dare not receive it: Becauſe I am not convinced, that you are wiſer than God.</p>
                  <p>If it really had been as you aſſert, it is certain Chriſt muſt have known it. And if he had known it, he would ſurely have warned us, he would have revealed it long ago. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has not, becauſe there is no Tittle of this in the whole Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, I am as fully aſſured your Aſſertion is falſe, as that this Revelation is of God.</p>
                  <p>"However, leave them off for a ſhort Time, to ſee whether you truſted in them or no." So I am to diſobey God, in order to know, whether I truſt in obeying him! And do you avow this Advice? Do you deliberately teach, to <hi>do Evil that Good may come?</hi> O tremble at the Sentence of God againſt ſuch Teachers! Their <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Nay, if you are troubled, when you leave them off, it is plain, you truſted in them." By no means. If I am troubled when I wilfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey God, it is plain his Spirit is ſtill ſtroving
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:028060_0234_0FD68C161864B0A0"/>with me. But if I am not troubled at wilful Sin, it is plain, I am given up to a reprobate Mind.</p>
                  <p>But what do you mean by "<hi>Truſting</hi> in them?" Looking for the Bleſſing of God therein? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that If I wait in this Way I ſhall attain, what otherwiſe I ſhould not? So I do. And ſo I will, God being my Helper, even to my Life's End.

                  <p n="2">2. It has been, ſecondly, objected, "This is ſeeking Salvation by Works." Do you know the Meaning of the Expreſſion you uſe? What is, "ſeeking Salvation by Works?" In the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it means, either ſeeking to be ſaved by obſerving the ritual Works of the Moſaic Law, or expecting Salvation for the Sake of our own Works, by the Merit of our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But how is either of theſe implied, in my waiting in the Way God has ordained, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that he will meet me there, becauſe he has promiſed ſo to do?</p>

Let us examine the Scriptures to which you refer. The firſt of them, with the Context, runs thus:</p>

                     <q>And when Pharoah drew nigh, the Children of Iſrael lift up their Eyes—and they were ſore afraid. And they ſaid unto Moſes, Becauſe there were no Graves in Egypt, haſt thou taken us away to die in the Wilderneſs? And Moſes ſaid unto the People, Fear ye not: Stand ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of the Lord. And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, ſpeak unto the Children of Iſrael, that they go forward. But lift thou up thy Rod, and ſtretch out thine Hand over the Sea and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it. And the Children of Iſrael ſhall go on dry Ground through the Midſt of the Sea, Exod. xiv, 10, &amp;c.</q>

<pb n="253" facs="unknown:028060_0238_0FD68C22D9061CD8"/>to ſing and to praiſe, the Lord ſet Ambuſhments againſt the Children of Moab, Ammon, and Mount Seir—and every one helped to deſtroy another, 2 Chron. xx. 2, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the Salvation which the Children of <hi>Judah</hi> ſaw. But how does all this prove, that we ought not to wait for the Grace of God, in the Means which he hath ordained?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I ſhall mention but one Objection more, which indeed does not properly belong to this Head. Nevertheleſs, becauſe it has been ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently urged, I may not wholly paſs it by.</p>
                  <p>"Does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt, why are ye ſubject to Ordinances? Col.</hi> ii. 20. Therefore a Chriſtian, one that is <hi>dead with Chriſt,</hi> need not uſe the Ordinances any more."</p>
                  <p>So you ſay, "If I am a Chriſtian, I am not ſubject to the Ordinances of Chriſt!" Surely, by the Abſurdity of this, you muſt ſee at the firſt Glance, that the Ordinances here mentioned can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Ordinances of Chriſt! That they muſt needs be the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ordinances, to which it is certain, a Chriſtian is no longer a Subject.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame undeniably appears from the Words immediately following, <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not</hi>—all evidently referring to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ordinances of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law.</p>
                  <p>So that this Objection is the weakeſt of all. And in Spight of all, that great Truth muſt ſtand unſhaken, That all who deſire the Grace of God, are to wait for it, in the Means which he hath ordained.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. 1. But this being allowed, that all who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Grace of God, are to wait for it in the Means he hath ordained: It may ſtill be enquired,
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:028060_0239_0FD68C23F7FE7900"/>how thoſe Means ſhould be uſed, both as to the <hi>Order,</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of uſing them;</p>
                  <p>With regard to the former, we may obſerve, there is a Kind of Order, wherein God himſelf is generally pleaſed, to uſe theſe Means, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sinner to Salvation. A ſtupid, ſenſeleſs Wretch is going on in his own Way, not having God in all his Thoughts, when God comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him unawares, perhaps by an awakening Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Converſation, perhaps by ſome awful Providence; or it may be by an immediate Stroke of his convincing Spirit, without any outward Means at all. Having now a Deſire to flee from the Wrath to come, he purpoſely goes to <hi>hear,</hi> how it may be done. If he find a Preacher who ſpeaks to the Heart, he is amazed, and begins <hi>ſearching the Scriptures,</hi> whether theſe Things are ſo? The more he <hi>hears</hi> and <hi>reads</hi> the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced he is; and the more he <hi>meditates</hi> thereon, Day and Night. Perhaps he finds ſome other Book, which explains and inforces what he has heard and read in Scripture. And by all theſe Means, the Arrows of Conviction ſink deeper into his Soul. He begins alſo to <hi>talk</hi> of the Things of God, which are ever uppermoſt in his Thoughts: Yea, and to talk with God, to <hi>pray</hi> to him, altho' through Fear and Shame, he ſcarce knows what to ſay. But whether he can ſpeak or no, he cannot but pray, were it only in <hi>Grouns which cannot be uttered.</hi> Yet being in doubt, whether <hi>the high and lofty One that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth Eternity</hi> will regard ſuch a Sinner as him, he wants to pray with thoſe who know God, with the Faithful, in the <hi>Great Congregation.</hi> But here he obſerves others go up to the <hi>Table of
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:028060_0240_0FD68C2610806D20"/>the Lord.</hi> He conſiders, Chriſt has ſaid, "Do this!" How is it, that I do not! I am too great a Sinner. I am not fit. I am not worthy. After ſtruggling with theſe Scruples a while, he breaks through. And thus he continues in God's Way, in hearing, reading, meditating, praying, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Lord's Supper, till God, in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that pleaſes him, ſpeaks to his Heart, <hi>Thy Faith hath ſaved thee! Go in Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By obſerving this Order of God, we may learn what Means to recommend to any particular Soul. If any of theſe will reach a ſtupid care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sinner, it is probably <hi>Hearing</hi> or <hi>Converſation.</hi> To ſuch therefore we might recommend thoſe, if he has ever any Thought about Salvation. To one who begins to feel the Weight of his Sins, not only Hearing the Word of God, but <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it too, and perhaps other <hi>ſerious Books</hi> may be a Means of deeper Conviction. May you not adviſe him alſo, to <hi>meditate</hi> on what he reads, that it may have its full Force upon his Heart? Yea, and to <hi>ſpeak</hi> thereof and not be aſhamed, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly among thoſe who walk in the ſame Path. When Trouble and Heavineſs take hold upon him, ſhould you not then earneſtly exhort him, to pour out his Soul before God! Always to <hi>pray and not to faint?</hi> And when he feels the Worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of his own Prayers, are you not to work together with God, and remind him of going up into <hi>the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> and praying with all them that fear him? But if he does this, the <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Word</hi> of his Lord, will ſoon be brought to his Remembrance: A plain Intimation, that this is the Time, when we ſhould ſecond the Motions of the Bleſſed Spirit. And thus may we lead him
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028060_0241_0FD68C27C1643F38"/>Step by Step, through all the Means which God has ordained; not according to our own Will, but juſt as the Providence and the Spirit of God go before and open the Way.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet as we find no Command in Holy Writ, for any particular Order to be obſerved herein, ſo neither do the Providence and the Spirit of God, adhere to any without Variation: But the Means into which different Men are led, and in which they find the Bleſſing of God, are varied, tranſpoſed and combined together, a thouſand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ways. Yet ſtill our Wiſdom is, to follow the Leadings of his Providence and his Spirit: To be guided herein (more eſpecially as to the Means wherein we ourſelves ſeek the Grace of God) partly by his outward Providence, giving us the Opportunity of uſing ſometimes one Means, ſometimes another: Partly by our Experience, which it is whereby his free Spirit is pleaſed moſt to work in our Heart. And in the mean time, the ſure and general Rule for all who groan for the Salvation of God, is this, Whenever Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſerves, uſe all the Means which God has ordained. For who knows, in which God will meet thee, with the Grace that bringeth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As to the <hi>Manner</hi> of uſing them, whereon indeed it wholly depends, whether they ſhould convey any Grace at all to the Uſer, it behoves us, Firſt, always to retain a lively Senſe, that God is above all Means. Have a Care therefore of limiting the Almighty. He doth whatſoever and whenſoever it pleaſeth him. He can convey his Grace, either in or out of any of the Means which he hath appointed. Perhaps he will. <hi>Who
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:028060_0242_0FD68C28DF4EF808"/>hath known the Mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his Counſellor?</hi> Look then every Moment for his Appearing! Be it at the Hour you are employed in his Ordinances; or before, or after that Hour. Or when you are hindered therefrom. He is not hindered. He is always ready: Always able, always willing to ſave. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Before</hi> you uſe any Means, let it be deeply impreſt on your Soul, "There is no <hi>Power</hi> in this. It is in itſelf a poor, dead, empty Thing: Separate from God; it is a dry Leaf, a Shadow. Neither is there any <hi>Merit</hi> in my uſing this; nothing intrinſically pleaſing to God, nothing whereby I deſerve any Favour at his hands, no, not a Drop of Water to cool my Tongue. But becauſe God bids, therefore I do; becauſe he directs me to wait in his Way, therefore here I wait for his free Mercy, whereof cometh my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>Settle this in your Heart, that the <hi>Opus Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the mere Work done profiteth nothing: That there is no <hi>Power</hi> to ſave, but in the Spirit of God; no <hi>Merit,</hi> but in the Blood of Chriſt: That conſequently, even what God ordains, conveys no Grace to the Soul, if you truſt not in him alone. On the other Hand, he that does truly truſt in him, cannot fall ſhort of the Grace of God, even tho' he were cut off from every Outward Ordinance, tho' he were ſhut up in the Center of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>In</hi> uſing all Means, ſeek God alone. In and through every Outward Thing, look ſingly to the <hi>Power</hi> of his Spirit, and the <hi>Merits</hi> of his Son. Beware you do not ſtick in the
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028060_0243_0FD68C2BDEBBFF08"/>
                     <hi>Work</hi> itſelf; if you do, it is all loſt Labour. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of God can ſatisfy your Soul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eye him, in all, through all, and above all.</p>
                  <p>Remember alſo, to uſe all Means, <hi>as Means:</hi> As ordained, not for their own Sake, but in order to the Renewal of your Soul in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. If therefore they actually tend to this, well. But if not, they are Dung and Droſs. Laſtly, <hi>After</hi> you have uſed any of theſe, take care, how you value yourſelf thereon: How you congratulate yourſelf, as having done ſome great Thing. This is turning all into Poiſon. Think, "If God was not there, what does this avail? Have I not been adding Sin to Sin? How long! O Lord! ſave or I periſh! O lay not this Sin to my Charge!" If God was there, if his Love flowed into your Heart, you have forgot, as it were, the Outward Work. You ſee, you know, you feel, God is All in All. Be abaſed. Sink down before him. Give him all the Praiſe. Let God <hi>in all Things be glorified through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Let <hi>all</hi> your <hi>Bones cry out, My Song ſhall be always of the Loving-kindneſs of the Lord: With my Mouth will I ever be telling of thy Truth, from one Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another!</hi>

In general we may obſerve, it is that habitual Diſpoſition of Soul, which in the Sacred Writings is termed Holineſs, and which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly implies, the being cleanſed from Sin <q>from all Filthineſs both of Fleſh and Spirit,</q> and by Conſequence, the being endued with thoſe Virtues, which were alſo in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the being ſo <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the Image of our Mind,</hi> as to be <hi>perfect, as our Father in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be more particular, Circumciſion of Heart implies, Humility, Faith, Hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Humility, a right Judgment of ourſelves, cleanſes our Minds from thoſe high Conceits of our own Perfections, from that undue Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our own Abilities and Attainments, which are the genuine Fruit of a corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This entirely cuts off that vain Thought, I am <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>have Need of nothing;</hi> and convinces us, that we are by Nature <hi>wretched. and poor, and miſerable, and blind, and naked.</hi> It convinces us, that in our beſt Eſtate, we are of ourſelves all Sin and Vanity; that Confuſion, and Ignorance, and Error, reign over our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that unreaſonable, earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh Paſſions, uſurp Authority over our Will: In a Word, that there is no whole Part in our Soul, that all the Foundations of our Nature are out of Courſe.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. A ſure Effect of our having formed this right Judgment, of the Sinfulneſs and Helpleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Nature, is a Diſregard of that <hi>Honour which cometh of Man,</hi> which is uſually paid to ſome ſuppoſed Excellency in us. He who knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, neither deſires nor values the Applauſe which he knows he deſerves not. It is therefore <hi>a very ſmall Thing with</hi> him, <hi>to be judged by Man's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He has all Reaſon to think, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what it has ſaid either for or againſt him, with what he feels in his own Breaſt, that the World, as well as the God of this World, was <hi>a Liar from the Beginning.</hi> And even as to thoſe who are not of the World, though he would chooſe, if it were the Will of God, that they ſhould account of him as of one deſirous to be ſound a faithful Steward of his Lord's Goods, if haply this might be a Means of enabling him to be of more Uſe to his Fellow-Servants, yet as this is the one End of his wiſhing for their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, ſo he does not at all reſt upon it. For he is aſſured, that whatever God wills, He can never want Inſtruments to perform; ſince He is able, even of theſe Stones, to raiſe up Servants to do his Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This is that Lowlineſs of Mind, which they have learned of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and tread in his Steps. And this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Diſeaſe, whereby they are more

                  <p n="8">8. Such a Faith as this, cannot fail to ſhew evidently the Power of Him that inſpires it, by delivering his Children from the Yoke of Sin, and <hi>purging</hi> their <hi>Conſciences from dead Works:</hi> By ſtrengthening them ſo, that they are no longer conſtrained to <hi>obey Sin in the Deſires thereof;</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>yielding their Members unto</hi> it, <hi>as Inſtruments of Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> they now <hi>yield</hi> themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <hi>unto GOD, as thoſe that are alive from the Dead.</hi>

<pb n="263" facs="unknown:028060_0251_0FD68C402691DEF0"/>that clear and chearful Confidence, that their Heart is upright toward God; that good Aſſurance, that they now do, through his Grace, the Things which are acceptable in his Sight; that they are now in the Path which leadeth to Life, and ſhall, by the Mercy of God, endure therein to the End.

To ſuppoſe this, is to ſuppoſe the Fountain of Holineſs, is directly the Author of Sin: Since he has inſeparably annexed Pleaſure to the Uſe of thoſe Creatures, which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſuſtain the Life he has given us.

II. 1. Thus have I particularly inquired, what that <hi>Circumciſion of Heart</hi> is, which will obtain the Praiſe or God. I am, in the ſecond Place, to mention ſome Reflections, that naturally ariſe from ſuch an Inquiry, as a plain Rule whereby eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man may judge of himſelf, whether he be of the World or of God.</p>
                  <p>And, firſt, it is clear, from what has been ſaid, That no Man has a Title to the Praiſe of God, unleſs his Heart is circumciſed by Humility, unleſs he is little, and baſe, and vile in his own Eyes: unleſs he is deeply convinced of that inbred "Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his Nature, whereby he is very far gone from Original Righteouſneſs," being prone to all Evil, averſe to all Good, corrupt and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; having a <hi>carnal Mind.</hi> which <hi>is Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt GOD, and is not ſubject to the Law of GOD; nor indeed can be:</hi> Unleſs he continually feels in his in moſt Soul, that without the Spirit of God reſting upon him, he can neither think, nor deſire, nor ſpeak, nor act, any Thing good or well-pleaſing in his Sight.</p>
                  <p>No Man, I ſay, has a Title to the Praiſe of God, 'till he feels his Want of God: Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 'till he ſeeketh that <hi>Honour, which cometh of GOD only:</hi> And neither deſires nor purſues that which cometh of Man, unleſs ſo far, only as it tends to this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Truth which naturally follows from what has been ſaid, is, that none ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Honour that cometh of God, unleſs his Heart be circumciſed by Faith; even a <hi>Faith of the Operation of GOD:</hi> unleſs refuſing to be any longer led by his Senſes, Appetites or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or even by that blind Leader of the Blind,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:028060_0256_0FD68C4B5F8F6820"/>ſo idolized by the World, natural Reaſon, he lives and <hi>walks by Faith,</hi> directs every Step, as <hi>ſeeing Him that is inviſible, looks not at the Things that are ſeen, which are temporal, but at the Things that are not ſeen which are eternal;</hi> and governs all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, Deſigns and Thoughts, all his Actions and Converſations, as one who is entered in within the Veil, where <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſits at the Right-hand of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It were to be wiſhed, that they were better acquainted with this Faith, who employ much of their Time and Pains, in laying another Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in grounding Religion, on "the Eternal <hi>Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Things," on "the intrinſick <hi>Excellence</hi> of Virtue," and the <hi>Beauty</hi> of Actions flowing from it: On the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> as they term them, of Good and Evil, and the <hi>Relations</hi> of Beings to each other. Either theſe Accounts of the Grounds of Chriſtian Duty, coincide with the Scriptural, or not. If they do, why are well-meaning Men perplext, and drawn from the weightier Matters of the Law, by a Cloud of Terms, whereby the eaſieſt Truths are explained into Obſcurity. If they are not, then it behoves them to conſider, who is the Author of this New Doctrine: Whether he is likely to be <hi>an Angel from Heaven,</hi> who <hi>preacheth another Goſpel</hi> than that of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Though, if he were, God, not we, hath pronounced his Sentence, <hi>Let him be accurſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Goſpel, as it knows no other Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Good Works than Faith, or of Faith than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo it clearly informs us, we are not his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, while we either deny Him to be the Author, or his Spirit to be the Inſpirer and Perfecter both of our Faith and Works. <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>he is none of his.</hi> He alone can
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:028060_0257_0FD68C4D30AB2EC8"/>quicken thoſe who are dead unto God, can breathe into them the Breath of Chriſtian Life, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, accompany, and follow them with his Grace, as to bring their good Deſires to good Effect. And <hi>as many as are thus led, by the Spirit of</hi> God, <hi>they are the Sons of</hi> God. This is God's ſhort and plain Account of true Religion and Virtue; and <hi>other Foundation can no Man lay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. From what has been ſaid we may, Thirdly, learn, That none is truly <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> unleſs that <hi>Spirit bear Witneſs with his Spirit, that he is a Child of</hi> God: unleſs he ſee the Prize and the Crown before him, and <hi>rejoice in Hope of the Glory of</hi> God: So greatly have they erred, who have taught that in ſerving God, we ought not to have a View to our own Happineſs. Nay, but we are often and expreſsly taught of God, to have Reſpect <hi>unto the Recompence of Reward;</hi> to balance the Toil with the <hi>Joy ſet before us,</hi> theſe <hi>light Afflictions</hi> with that <hi>exceeding Weight of Glory.</hi> Yea, we are <hi>Aliens to the Covenant of Promiſe,</hi> we are <hi>without</hi> God <hi>in the World,</hi> until God <hi>of his abundant Mercy, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten us again, unto a living Hope, of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. But if theſe Things are ſo, 'tis high Time for thoſe Perſons to deal faithfully with their own Souls, who are ſo far from finding in themſelves this joyful Aſſurance, that they fulfil the Terms and ſhall obtain the Promiſes of that Covenant, as to quarrel with the Covenant itſelf, and blaſpheme the Terms of it: To complain, "They are too ſevere, and that no Man ever did, or ſhall live up to them!" What is this, but to reproach God, as if He were an hard Maſter, requiring of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Alas, that Conſequence will by no Means hold.

What think you? Are theſe now the Children of God?

                  <p n="4">4. How indeed, except ye be born again! For ye are now dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins. To ſay then, that ye cannot be born again, That there is no New-birth but in Baptiſm, is to ſeal you all under Damnation, to conſign you to Hell, without Help, without Hope. And perhaps ſome may think this juſt and right. In their Zeal for the Lord of Hoſts, they may ſay, "Yea, cut off the Sinners, the <hi>Amelekites!</hi> Let theſe <hi>Gibeonites</hi> be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed!

Come forth, ye "Saints of the World." ye that are honoured of Men, and ſee who will caſt the firſt Stone at them, at theſe Wretches, not fit to live upon the Earth, theſe common Harlots, Adultevers, Murderers.

Let him now have Power, ſo to believe in thy Name, as to become the Child of God; as to know and feel he hath <hi>Redemption in thy Blood, even the Forgiveneſs of Sins,</hi> and that he <hi>cannot commit Sin, becauſe he is born of</hi> God. Let him be now <hi>begotten again unto a living Hope,</hi> ſo as to <hi>purify himſelf, as Thou art pure!</hi> And <hi>becauſe he is a Son,</hi> let the Spirit of Love and of Glory reſt upon him, cleanſing him <hi>from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> and teaching him to <hi>perfect Holineſs in the Fear of</hi> God!</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p n="1">1. IT has been frequently ſuppoſed, that the being born of God was all one with the being juſtified; that the new birth and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were only different expreſſions, denoting the ſame thing: It being certain on the one hand, that whoever is juſtified, is alſo born of God; and on the other, that whoever is born of God, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo juſtified: Yea, that both theſe gifts of God are given to every believer in one and the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In one point of time his ſins are blotted out, and he is born again of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But though it be alſo wed, that juſtification and the new birth are in point of time inſeparable from each other, yet are they eaſily diſtinguiſhed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> being not the ſame, but things of a widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature. Juſtification implies only a relative, the new birth a real change. God in juſtifying us, does ſomething <hi>for</hi> us: In begetting us again, he does the work <hi>in</hi> us. The former changes our outward relation to God, ſo that of enemies we become children. By the latter our inmoſt ſouls are changed, ſo that of ſinners we become ſaints.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028060_0282_0FD68C8D05FE35D0"/>The one reſtores us to the favour, the other to the image of God. The one is, the taking away the guilt, the other, the taking away the power of ſin. So that although they are joined together in point of time, yet are they of wholly diſtinct natures.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The not diſcerning this, the not obſerving the wide difference there is, between being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and being born again, has occaſioned exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great confuſion of thought, in many who have treated on this ſubject: particularly when they have attempted to explain this great privilege of the children of God; to ſhew how <hi>whoſoever is born of</hi> God, <hi>doth not commit ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. In order to apprehend this clearly, it may be neceſſary, firſt, to conſider what is the proper meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>Whoſoever is born of</hi> God; and, ſecondly, to enquire, in what ſenſe he <hi>doth not commit ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. 1. Firſt, we are to conſider, what is the proper meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>Whoſoever is born of</hi> God. And in general, from all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of holy writ, wherein this expreſſion, the being <hi>born of</hi> God, occurs, we may learn that it implies not barely the being baptized, or any outward change whatever; but a vaſt inward change, a change wrought in the ſoul, by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt: a change in the whole manner of our exiſtence; for from the moment we are <hi>born of</hi> God, we live in quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner than we did before; we are, as it were, in another world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ground and reaſon of the expreſſion, his eaſy to be underſtood. When we under go this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028060_0283_0FD68C8F1A221428"/>great change, we may with much propriety be ſaid <hi>to be born again,</hi> becauſe there is ſo near a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between the circumſtances of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and of the ſpiritual birth: ſo that to conſider the circumſtances of the natural birth, is the moſt eaſy way to underſtand the ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The child which is not yet born, ſubſiſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by the air, as does every thing which has life; but <hi>feels</hi> it not, nor any thing elſe, unleſs in a very dull and imperfect manner. It <hi>hears</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, if at all, the organs of hearing being as yet cloſed up. It <hi>ſees</hi> nothing, having its eyes faſt ſhut, and being ſurrounded with utter darkneſs, There are, it may be, ſome ſaint beginnings of life, when the time of its birth draws nigh; and ſome motion conſequent thereon, whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from a mere maſs of matter. But it has no <hi>ſenſes;</hi> all theſe avenues of the ſoul are hitherto quite ſhut up. Of conſequence, it has ſcarce any intercourſe with this viſible world: nor any knowledge, conception, or idea, of the things that occur therein.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The reaſon why he that is not yet born, is wholly a ſtranger to the viſible world, is, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is afar off. It is very nigh. It ſurrounde him on every ſide. But partly, becauſe he has not thoſe ſenſes, they are not yet opened in his ſoul, whereby alone it is poſſible to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the material world; and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo thick a veil is caſt between, thro' which he can diſcern nothing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But no ſooner is the child born into the world, than he exiſts in a quite different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He now <hi>feels</hi> the air with which he is ſurrounded, and which pours into him from
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028060_0284_0FD68C917A3BD640"/>every ſide, as faſt as he alternately breathes it back, to ſuſtain the flame of life. And hence ſprings a continual increaſe of ſtrength, of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of ſenſation: all the bodily ſenſes being now awakened, and furniſhed with their proper objects.</p>
                  <p>His eyes are now opened to perceive the light, which ſilently flowing in upon them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers not only itſelf, but an inſinite variety of things, with which before he was wholly unacquainted. His ears are uncloſed, and ſounds ruſh in, with endleſs diverſity. Every, ſenſe is employed upon ſuch objects as are peculiarly ſuitable to it. And by theſe inlets, the ſoul having an open intercourſe with the viſible world, acquires more and more knowledge of ſenſible things, of all the things which are under the ſun.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. So it is with him that is born of God. Before that great change is wrought, although he ſubſiſts by him, in whom all that have life <hi>live and move and have their being,</hi> yet he is not <hi>ſenſible</hi> of God; he does not <hi>feel,</hi> he has no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſciouſneſs of his preſence. He does not perceive that divine breath of life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he cannot ſubſiſt a moment. Nor is he ſenſible of any of the things of God. They make no impreſſion upon his ſoul. God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually calling to him from on high, but he heareth not; his ears are ſhut; ſo that <hi>the voice of the charmer</hi> is loſt to him, <hi>charm he n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>r ſo wiſely.</hi> He ſeeth not the things of the ſpirit of God, the eyes of his underſtanding being cloſed, and utter darkneſs covering his whole ſoul, ſurrounding him on every ſide. It is true, he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028060_0285_0FD68C95A24C0780"/>may have ſome ſaint dawnings of life, ſome ſmall beginnings of ſpiritual motion; but as yet he has no ſpiritual ſenſes, capable of diſcerning ſpiritual objects. Conſequently he <hi>diſcerneth not the things of the ſpirit of</hi> God. <hi>He cannot know them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Hence he has ſcarce any knowledge of the inviſible world, as he has ſcarce any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with it. Not that it is afar off. No: he is in the midſt of it: it encompaſſes him round about. The <hi>other world,</hi> as we uſually term it, is not far from every one of us. It is above, and beneath, and on every ſide. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the natural man diſcerneth it not; partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has no ſpiritual ſenſes, whereby alone we can diſcern the things of God; partly, becauſe ſo thick a veil is interpoſed, as he knows not how to penetrate.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But when he is born of God, born of the Spirit, how is the manner of his exiſtence chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? his whole ſoul is now ſenſible of God, and he can ſay by ſure experience, <hi>thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my bed, and about my path;</hi> I feel thee <hi>in all my ways.</hi> Thou <hi>beſetteſt me behind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and layeſt thy hand upon me.</hi> The ſpirit or breath of God is immediately inſpired, breathed into the new-born ſoul. And the ſame breath which comes from, returns to God: as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually received by faith, ſo it is continually rendered back by love, by prayer, an praiſe, and thankſgiving: love and praiſe and prayer being the breath of every ſoul which is truly born of God. And by this new kind of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reſpiration, ſpiritual life is not only ſuſtained, but increaſed day by day; together with ſpiritual
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028060_0286_0FD68C9727002D38"/>ſtrength and motion, and ſenſation. All the ſenſes of the ſoul be now awake, and capable of <hi>diſcerning</hi> ſpiritual <hi>good and evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>The eyes of his underſtanding</hi> are now <hi>open,</hi> and he <hi>ſeeth him that is inviſible.</hi> He ſees what is <hi>the exceeding greatneſs of his power,</hi> and of his love toward them that believe. He ſees that God is merciful to him a ſinner; that he is reconciled through the ſon of his love. He clearly perceives both the pardoning love of God, and all his <hi>exceeding great and precious promiſes.</hi> God <hi>who commandeth the light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſhined,</hi> and doth ſhine, <hi>in</hi> his <hi>heart, to enlighten him with the knowledge of the Glory of</hi> God, <hi>in the face of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. All the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is now paſſed away, and he abides in the light of God's countenance.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. His ears are now opened, and the voice of God no longer calls in vain. He hears and obeys the heavenly calling: He <hi>knows the voice of his ſhepherd.</hi> All his ſpiritual ſenſes being now awakened, he has a clear intercourſe with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible world. And hence he knows more and more of the things which before <hi>it could not enter into his heart to conceive.</hi> He now knows what the peace of God is: what is joy in the Holy Ghoſt: what the love of God which is ſhed abroad in the hearts of them that believe in him thro' <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Thus the veil being removed, which before interrupted the light and voice, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and love of God, he who is born of the ſpirit, <hi>dwelling in love, dwelleth in</hi> God <hi>and</hi> God <hi>in him.</hi>
                  </p>

II. 1. Having conſidered the meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>whoſoever is born of God,</hi> it remains in the ſecond place to enquire, in what ſenſe he <hi>doth not commit ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now one who is ſo born of God as hath been above deſcribed, who continually receives into his ſoul the breath of life from God, the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influence of his Spirit, and continually ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it back: one who thus believes and loves; who by faith perceives the continual actings of God upon his ſpirit; and by a kind of ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, returns the grace he receives in unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love, and praiſe, and prayer; not only <hi>doth not commit ſin</hi> while <hi>he</hi> thus <hi>keepeth himſelf;</hi> but ſo long as this <hi>ſeed remaineth in him,</hi> he <hi>cannot ſin,</hi> becauſe he is born of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By <hi>ſin,</hi> I here underſtand, outward ſin, according to the plain, common acceptation of the word: an actual, voluntary <hi>tranſgreſſion of the law;</hi> of the revealed, written law of God: of any commandment of God, acknowledged to be ſuch, at the time that it is tranſgreſſed. But <hi>whoſoever is born of God,</hi> while he abideth in faith and love, and in the ſpirit of prayer and thankſgiving, not only <hi>doth not,</hi> but <hi>cannot</hi> thus <hi>commit ſin.</hi> So long as he thus believeth in God through Chriſt, and loves him, and is pouring out his heart before him, he cannot vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily tranſgreſs any command of God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſpeaking or acting what he knows God hath forbidden. So long that <hi>ſeed</hi> which <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him,</hi> that loving, praying, thankful faith compels him to refrain from whatſoever he knows to be an abomination in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:028060_0288_0FD68C9B9347FD48"/>
3. But here a difficulty will immediately occur; and one, that to many has appeared inſuperable, and induced them to deny the plain aſſertion of the apoſtle, and give up the privilege of the children of God.</p>
                  <p>It is plain in fact, that thoſe whom we cannot deny to have been truly <hi>born of</hi> God (the ſpirit of God having given us in his word, this infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony concerning them) nevertheleſs not only could, but did commit ſin, even groſs, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſin. They did tranſgreſs the plain, known laws of God, ſpeaking or acting what they knew he had forbidden.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thus <hi>David</hi> was unqueſtionably born of God, or ever he was anointed king over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He knew in whom he had believed; he was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xxiii. 1, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>The</hi> Lord, ſaith he, <hi>is my ſhepherd; therefore can I lack nothing. He ſhall feed me in green paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and lead me forth beſide the waters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> Yea, <hi>though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me.</hi> He was filled with love; ſuch as often conſtrained him to cry out,<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xviii. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>I will love thee, O</hi> Lord, <hi>my</hi> God: <hi>the</hi> Lord <hi>is my ſtony rock, and my defence: the born al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of my ſalvation, and my refuge.</hi> He was a man of prayer, pouring out his ſoul before God, in all circumſtances of life; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in praiſes and thankſgiving;<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. xxxiv. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>thy praiſe,</hi> faith he, <hi>ſhall be ever in my mouth.</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſal. cxviii. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art my</hi> God, <hi>and I will thank thee; thou art my</hi> God <hi>and I will praiſe thee.</hi> And yet ſuch a child of God
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028060_0289_0FD68CA0F9FEE898"/>could and did commit ſin; yea, the horrid ſins of adultery and murder.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And even after the Holy Ghoſt was more largely given, after <hi>life and immortality</hi> were <hi>brought to light by the goſpel,</hi> we want not inſtances of the ſame melancholy kind, which were alſo doubtleſs written for our inſtruction. Thus he who (proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from his<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts iv. 36, 37.</note> 
                     <hi>ſelling</hi> all that he had, and <hi>bringing the price</hi> for the relief of his poor brethren) was <hi>by the apoſtles</hi> themſelves <hi>ſirnamed</hi> Barnabas, that is, <hi>the ſon of conſolation;</hi> who was ſo honoured at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as to be ſelected with <hi>Saul</hi> out of all <hi>the diſciples,</hi> to carry their<note n="†" place="bottom">Ch. xi. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>relief unto the brethren in</hi> Judea: this <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who at his return from <hi>Judea,</hi> was by the peculiar direction of the Holy Ghoſt, ſolemnly<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ch. xiii. 1, 2, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>ſeparated from the</hi> other <hi>prophets and teachers, for the work whereunto God had called him,</hi> even to accompany the great apoſtle among the gentiles, and to be his fellow-labourer in every place; nevertheleſs was afterward ſo<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ch. xv. 35, 38, 39.</note> 
                     <hi>ſharp</hi> in his <hi>contention</hi> with St. <hi>Paul</hi> (becauſe he <hi>thought it not good to take with them</hi> John, in his <hi>viſiting the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> a ſecond time, <hi>who had departed from them from</hi> Pamphylia, <hi>and went not with them to the work</hi>) that he himſelf alſo departed from the work; that he <hi>took</hi> John, <hi>and ſailed unto</hi> Cyprus; forſaking him to whom he had been in ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate a manner joined by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. An inſtance more aſtoniſhing than both theſe is given by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians. When</hi> Peter, the aged, the zealous, the firſt of the apoſtles, one of the three moſt highly favoured by his Lord; <hi>was come to</hi> Antioch, <hi>I withſtood him to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028060_0290_0FD68CA267AE5EF8"/>the face, becauſe he was to be blamed. For before that certain came from</hi> James, <hi>he did eat with the gentiles,</hi> the heathens converted to the chriſtian faith, as having been peculiarly taught of God, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xi. 28.</note> he <hi>ſhould not call any man common or unclean.</hi> But<note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. ii. 11, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>when they were come, he ſeparated himſelf, fearing them which were of the circumciſion. And the other Jews diſſembled likewiſe with him; inſomuch that</hi> Barnabas <hi>alſo was carried away with their diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But when I ſaw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the goſpel, I ſaid unto</hi> Peter <hi>before them all, if thou being a Jew, liveſt after the manner of the gentiles,</hi> not regarding the ceremonial law of <hi>Moſes, why compelleſt thou the gentiles to live as do the Jews?</hi> here is alſo plain, undeniable ſin, committed by one who was undoubtedly <hi>born of God.</hi> But how can this be reconciled with the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of St. <hi>John,</hi> if taken in the obvious literal meaning, that <hi>whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. I anſwer, what has been long obſerved is this: ſo long as <hi>he that is born of God keepeth himſelf</hi> (which he is able to do, by the grace of God) <hi>the wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> But if he keepeth not himſelf, if he abide not in the faith, he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin even as another man.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſy therefore to underſtand, how any of theſe children of God might be moved from his own ſtedfaſtneſs, and yet the great truth of God, declared by the apoſtle, remain ſtedfaſt and unſhaken. He did not <hi>keep himſelf</hi> by that grace of God which was ſufficient for him. He fell, ſtep by ſtep, firſt, into negative, inward ſin, not <hi>ſtirring up the gift of God</hi> which was in him,

                  <p n="8">8. To explain this by a particular inſtance: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was born of God, and ſaw God by faith. He loved God in ſincerity. He could truly ſay, <hi>whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth</hi> (neither perſon, nor thing) <hi>that I deſire in compariſon of thee!</hi> but ſtill there remained in his heart that corruption of nature, which is the ſeed of all evil.</p>

The ſpirit of God did not fail to convince him of this. He doubtleſs heard and knew the warning voice. But he yielded in ſome meaſure to the thought, and the temptation began to prevail over him. Hereby his ſpirit was ſullied; he ſaw God ſtill; but it was more dimly than before. He loved God ſtill; but not in the ſame degree, not with the ſame ſtrength and ardor of affection. Yet God checked him again, though his ſpirit was grieved; and his voice, though fainter and fainter, ſtill whiſpered, "Sin lieth at the door; look unto me, and be thou ſaved." But he would not hear. He looked again, not unto God, but unto the forbidden object, till nature was ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to grace, and kindled luſt in his ſoul.</p>

                  <p n="10">10. To explain this by another inſtance. The apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was full of faith and of the Holy Ghoſt; and hereby keeping himſelf, he had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence toward God and toward man.</p>
                  <p>Walking thus in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, <hi>before that certain came from</hi> James, <hi>he did eat with the gentiles,</hi> knowing that what God had cleanſed, was not common or unclean.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028060_0293_0FD68CA79A66E170"/>
But <hi>when they were come,</hi> a temptation aroſe in his heart, <hi>to fear thoſe of the circumciſion</hi> (the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh converts, who were zealous for circumciſron and the other rites of the Moſaic law) and regard the favour and praiſe of theſe men, more than the praiſe of God.</p>
                  <p>He was warned by the ſpirit that ſin was near. Nevertheleſs he yielded to it in ſome degree, even to ſinful fear of man, and his faith and love were proportionably weakened.</p>
                  <p>God reproved him again for giving place to the devil. Yet he would not hearken to the voice of his ſhepherd; but gave himſelf up to that flaviſh fear, and thereby quenched the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Then God diſappeared, and faith and love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extinct, he committed the outward ſin. <hi>Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not uprightly,</hi> not <hi>according to the truth of the goſpel,</hi> he <hi>ſeparated himſelf</hi> from his chriſtian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and by his evil example, if not advice alſo, <hi>compelled</hi> even <hi>the</hi> Gentiles <hi>to live after the manner of the</hi> Jews; to entangle themſelves again with that <hi>yoke of bondage,</hi> from which <hi>Chriſt had ſet them free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it is unqueſtionably true, that he who is born of God, keeping himſelf, doth not, cannot commit ſin; and yet, if he keepeth not himſelf, he may commit all manner of ſin with greedineſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. 1. From the preceding conſiderations we may learn, firſt, To give a clear and unconteſtible anſwer, to a queſtion which has frequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed many, who were ſincere of heart. Does ſin precede or follow the loſs of faith? "Does a child of God firſt commit ſin, and thereby loſe his faith? Or does he loſe his faith firſt, before he can commit ſin?"</p>

                  <p n="2">2. From what has been ſaid, we may learn, ſecondly, what the life of God in the ſoul of a believer is; wherein it properly conſiſts; and what is immediately and neceſſarily implied therein. It immediately and neceſſarily implies, the continual inſpiration of God's Holy Spirit: God's breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſoul, and the ſoul's breathing back what it firſt receives from God: a continual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God upon the ſoul, and re-action of the ſoul upon God: an unceaſing preſence of God, the loving, pardoning God, manifeſted to the heart, and perceived by faith; and an unceaſing return of love, praiſe, and prayer, offering up all the thoughts of our hearts, all the words of our
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028060_0295_0FD68CAED55F9E60"/>tongues, all the works of our hands, all our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſoul, and ſpirit, to be an holy ſacrifice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And hence we may, thirdly, infer, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of this re-action of the ſoul (whatſoever it be called) in order to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the divine life therein. For it plainly appears, God does not continue to act upon the ſoul, unleſs the ſoul re-acts upon God. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents us indeed with the bleſſings of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He firſt loves us, and manifeſts himſelf unto us. While we are yet afar off, he calls us to himſelf, and ſhines upon our hearts. But if we do not then love him who firſt loved us, if we will not hearken to his voice; if we turn our eye away from him, and will not attend to the light which he pours upon us, his ſpirit will not always ſtrive; he will gradually withdraw, and leave us to the darkneſs of our own hearts. He will not continue to breathe into our ſoul, unleſs our ſoul breathes toward him again; unleſs our love, and prayer, and thankſgiving return to him, a ſacrifice wherewith he is well pleaſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us learn, laſtly, to follow that directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great apoſtle, <hi>Be not high minded, but fear.</hi> Let us fear ſin more than death or hell. Let us have a jealous (tho' not painful) fear, leſt we ſhould lean to our own deceitful hearts. <hi>Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Even he who now ſtandeth faſt in the grace of God, in the <hi>faith</hi> that <hi>overcometh the world,</hi> may nevertheleſs fall into inward ſin, and thereby <hi>make ſhipwreck of his faith.</hi> And how eaſily then will outward ſin regain its dominion over him? Thou therefore, O man of God, watch always; that thou mayeſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028060_0296_0FD68CAFD7D541E0"/>always hear the voice of God. Watch that thou mayeſt pray without ceaſing, at all times and in all places, pouring out thy heart before him. So ſhalt thou always believe, and always love, and never commit ſin.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us obſerve, who it is, that is here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we may <hi>take heed how</hi> we <hi>hear.</hi> It is the Lord of heaven and earth, the Creator of all, who as ſuch, has a right to diſpoſe of all his creatures; the Lord our governor, whoſe kingdom is from everlaſting, and ruleth over all; the great lawgiver, who can well enforce all his laws, being <hi>able to ſave and to deſtroy;</hi> yea, to puniſh with everlaſting deſtruction from his preſence and from the glory of his power. It is the eternal wiſdom of the Father, who knoweth whereof we are made, and underſtands our inmoſt frame; who knows how we ſtand related to God, to one another, to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which God hath made; and conſequently how to adapt every law he preſcribes, to all the circumſtances wherein he hath placed us. It is he who is <hi>loving unto every man, whoſe mercy is over all his works:</hi> The God of love, who having emptied himſelf of his eternal glory, is come forth from his Father, to declare his will to the children of men, and then goeth again to the Father: who is ſent of God <hi>to open the eyes of the blind, to give light to them that fit in darkneſs:</hi> it is the great prophet of the Lord, concerning whom God had ſolemnly declared
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028060_0300_0FD68CB8D240F558"/>long ago,<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xviii. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Whoſoever will not hearken unto my words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of him.</hi> Or, as the apoſtle expreſſes it,<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts iii. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Every ſoul which will not hear that prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from among the people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. And what is it which he is teaching? The Son of God, who came from heaven, is here ſhewing us the way to heaven, to the place which he hath prepared for us, the glory he had before the world began. He is teaching us the true way to life everlaſting, the royal way which leads to the kingdom. And the only true way; for there is none beſides: all other paths lead to deſtruction. From the character of the ſpeaker we are well aſſured, that he hath declared the full and perfect will of God. He hath utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not one tittle too much; nothing more than he had received of the Father. Nor too little; he hath not ſhunned to declare the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God. Much leſs hath he uttered any thing wrong, any thing contrary to the will of him that ſent him. All his words are true, and right, concerning all things, and ſhall ſtand faſt for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>And we may eaſily remark, that in explaining and confirming theſe faithful and true ſayings, he takes care to refute not only the miſtakes of the Scribes and Phariſees which then were, the falſe comments whereby the Jewiſh teachers of that age had perverted the word of God; but all the practical miſtakes, that are inconſiſtent
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028060_0301_0FD68CBE90A36258"/>with ſalvation, which ſhould ever ariſe in the Chriſtian church: all the comments whereby the Chriſtian teachers (ſo called) of any age or nation ſhould pervert the word of God, and teach unwary ſouls to ſeek death in the error of their life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And hence we are naturally led to obſerve, whom it is that he is here teaching? Not the apoſtles alone; if ſo, he had no need to have gone <hi>up into the mountain.</hi> A room in the houſe of Matthew, or any of his diſciples, would have contained the twelve. Nor does it in any wiſe appear, that the <hi>diſciples</hi> who <hi>came unto him,</hi> were the twelve only. O <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine</hi> (or teaching). <hi>For he taught</hi> them (the multitudes) <hi>as one having authority, and not as the ſcribes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor was it only thoſe multitudes who were with him on the mount, to whom he now taught the way of ſalvation; but all the children of men, the whole race of mankind, the children that were yet unborn; all the generations to come even to the end of the world, who ſhould ever hear the words of this life.</p>

5. And this all men allow, with regard to ſome parts of the enſuing diſcourſe. No man, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, denies, that what is ſaid of <hi>poverty of ſpirit,</hi> relates to all mankind. But many have ſuppoſed, that other parts concerned only the apoſtles, or the firſt chriſtians, or the miniſters of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and were never deſigned for the generality of men, who conſequently, have nothing at all to do with them.</p>
                     <p>But may we not juſtly enquire, who told them this? that ſome parts of this diſcourſe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the apoſtles? or the chriſtians of the apoſtolic age? or the miniſters of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> bare aſſertions are not a ſufficient proof, to eſtabliſh a point of ſo great importance. Has then our Lord himſelf taught us, that ſome parts of his diſcourſe, do not concern all mankind? without doubt, had it been ſo, he would have told us; he could not have omitted ſo neceſſary an informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But has he told us ſo? where? in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe itſelf? no: here is not the leaſt intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Has he ſaid ſo elſewhere? in any other of his diſcourſes? not one word ſo much as glanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this way, can we find in any thing he ever ſpoke, either to the multitudes or to his diſciples. Has any of the apoſtles, or other inſpired writers, left ſuch an inſtruction upon record? no ſuch thing. No aſſertion of this kind is to be found in all the oracles of God. Who then are the men who are ſo much wiſer than God? wiſe, ſo far above that is written?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Perhaps they will ſay, "That the reaſon of the thing requires ſuch a reſtriction to be made." If it does, it muſt be on one of theſe
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028060_0303_0FD68CC1144967B8"/>two accounts; becauſe without ſuch a reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the diſcourſe would either be apparently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, or would contradict ſome other ſcripture, But this is not the caſe. It will plainly appear, when we come to examine the ſeveral particulars, that there is no abſurdity at all in applying all which our Lord hath here delivered, to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Neither will it infer any contradiction to any thing elſe he has delivered, nor to any other ſcripture whatever. Nay, it will farther appear, that either all the parts of this diſcourſe are to be applied to men in general; or no part; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are all connected together, all joined as the ſtones in an arch, of which you cannot take one away, without deſtroying the whole fabric.</p>

                     <p>It may not improbably be ſuppoſed, that our Lord, looking on thoſe who were round about him, and obſerving that not many rich were there, but rather the poor of the world, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from thence to make a tranſition from temporal to ſpiritual things. <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaith he (or <hi>happy;</hi> ſo the word ſhould be rendered, both in this and the following verſes) <hi>are the poor in ſpirit.</hi> He does not ſay, they that are <hi>poor</hi> as to <hi>outward circumſtances;</hi> it being not impoſſible that ſome of theſe may be as far from happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a monarch upon his throne: but <hi>the poor in ſpirit,</hi> they who, whatever their outward circumſtances are, have that diſpoſition of heart, which is the firſt ſtep to all real, ſubſtantial happineſs, either in this world or that which is to come.</p>

3. Some have judged, That by the <hi>poor in ſpirit</hi> here, are meant, thoſe who love poverty; thoſe who are free from covetouſneſs; from the love of money; who fear, rather than deſire riches. Perhaps they have been induced ſo to judge, by wholly confining their thought to the very term: or by conſidering that weighty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of St. <hi>Paul, that the love of money is the root of all evil.</hi> And hence many have wholly diveſted themſelves, not only of riches, but of all worldly goods. Hence alſo the vows of voluntary poverty, ſeem to have ariſen in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church: it being ſuppoſed that ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a degree of this fundamental grace, muſt be a large ſtep toward <hi>the kingdom of heaven.</hi>

His meaning can only be, it is the root of very many evils; perhaps of more than any ſingle vice beſides: Secondly, that this ſenſe of the expreſſion, <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> will by no means ſuit our Lord's preſent deſign, which is to lay a general foundation whereon the whole fabric of chriſtianity may be built; a deſign which would be in no wiſe anſwered, by guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt one particular vice: ſo that, if even this were ſuppoſed to be one part of his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it could not poſſibly be the whole: Thirdly, that it cannot be ſuppoſed to be any part of his meaning, unleſs we charge him with manifeſt tautology: ſeeing if <hi>poverty of ſpirit</hi> were only

                     <p>One of theſe can no longer ſay, <hi>I am rich, and increaſed in goods, and have need of nothing:</hi> as now knowing, that he is <hi>wretched, and poor, and miſerable, and blind, and naked.</hi> He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he is ſpiritually poor indeed; having no ſpiritual good abiding in him. <hi>In me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>dwelleth no good thing;</hi> but whatſoever is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and abominable. He has a deep ſenſe of the loathſome leproſy of ſin, which he brought with him from his mother's womb, which overſpreads his whole ſoul, and totally corrupts every power and faculty thereof. He ſees more and more of the evil tempers, which ſpring from that evil root: the pride and haughtineſs of ſpirit, the conſtant bias to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think: the vanity, the thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the eſteem or honour that cometh from men: the hatred or envy, the jealouſy or revenge, the anger, malice, or bitterneſs; the inbred enmity both againſt God and man, which appears in ten thouſand ſhapes: the love of the world, the ſelf-will, the fooliſh and hurtful deſires, which cleave to his inmoſt ſoul. He is conſcious how deeply he has offended by his tongue; if not by profane, immodeſt, untrue, or unkind words, yet by diſcourſe which was not <hi>good, to the uſe

How ſhall he pay him that he oweth? were he from this moment to perform the moſt perfect obedience to every command of God, this would make no amends for a ſingle ſin, for any one act of paſt diſobedience: ſeeing he owes God all the ſervice he is able to perform from this moment to all eternity, could he pay this, it would make no manner of amends, for what he ought to have done before. He ſees himſelf

                     <p>But if God would forgive him all that is paſt, on this one condition, that he ſhould ſin no more, that for the time to come he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and conſtantly obey all his commands: he well knows that this would profit him nothing, being a condition he could never perform. He knows and feels, that he is not able to obey, even the outward commands of God: ſeeing theſe cannot be obeyed, while his heart remains in its natural ſinfulneſs and corruption: In as much as an evil tree, cannot bring forth good fruit. But he cannot cleanſe a ſinful heart, with men this is impoſſible. So that he is utterly at a loſs, even how to begin walking in the path of God's commandments. He knows not how to get one ſtep forward in the way. Incompaſſed with ſin and ſorrow, and fear, and finding no way to eſcape, he can only cry out, Lord <hi>ſave, or I periſh!</hi>

                     <p>He proceeds to ſhew, that they were helpleſs as well as guilty; which is the plain purport of all thoſe expreſſions, <hi>therefore by the deeds of the law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified—but now the righteouſneſs of</hi> God, <hi>which is by faith, of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>without the law is manifeſted—we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a man is juſtified by faith, without the deeds of the law:</hi> expreſſions all tending to the ſame point, even to <hi>hide pride from man:</hi> to humble him to the duſt, without teaching him to reflect upon his humility as a virtue; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire him with that full piercing conviction of his utter ſinfulneſs, guilt and helpleſſneſs, which caſts the ſinner, ſtript of all, loſt and undone, on his ſtrong helper, Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the righteous.</hi>

But they ſee temptation and ſin, which they fondly ſuppoſed were gone never to return, ariſing again, following after them amain, and holding them in on every ſide. It is not ſtrange if their ſoul is now diſquieted within them, and trouble and heavineſs take hold upon them. Nor will their great enemy fail to improve the occaſion, to aſk, "Where is now thy God? where is now the bleſſedneſs whereof thou ſpakeſt? the beginning of the kingdom of heaven? Yea, hath God ſaid, Thy ſins are forgiven thee? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God hath not ſaid it. It was only a dream, a mere deluſion, a creature of thy own imagination. If thy ſins are forgiven, why art thou thus? can a pardoned ſinner be thus unholy?"—And if then, inſtead of immediately crying to God, they reaſon with him that is wiſer than they, they will be in heavineſs indeed, in ſorrow of heart, in anguiſh not to be expreſſed. Nay, even when God ſhines again upon the ſoul, and takes away all doubt of his paſt mercy, ſtill he that is <hi>weak in faith</hi> may be tempted and troubled, on account of what is to come: eſpecially, when inward ſin revives, and thruſts ſore at him that he may fall.

                     <p n="6">6. But altho' this mourning is at an end, is loſt in holy joy, by the return of the comforter, yet is there another, and a bleſſed mourning it is, which abides in the children of God. They ſtill mourn for the ſins and miſeries of mankind: they <hi>weep with them that weep.</hi> They weep for them that weep not for themſelves, for the ſinners againſt their own ſouls. They mourn for the weakneſs and unfaithfulneſs of thoſe, that are in ſome meaſure ſaved from their ſins. <hi>Who is weak and they are not weak? Who is offended and they
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028060_0319_0FD68CE6A6FEB250"/>burn not?</hi> They are grieved for the diſhonour continually done to the Majeſty of heaven and earth. At all times they have an awful ſenſe of this, which brings a deep ſeriouſneſs upon their ſpirit: a ſeriouſneſs which is not a little increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince the eyes of their underſtanding were opened, by their continually ſeeing the vaſt ocean of eternity, without a bottom or a ſhore, which has already ſwallowed up millions of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of men, and is gaping to devour them that yet remain. They ſee here the houſe of God eternal in the heavens; there, hell and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without a covering; and thence feel the importance of every moment, which juſt appears, and is gone for ever.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But all this wiſdom of God is fooliſhneſs with the world. The whole affair of <hi>mourning</hi> and <hi>poverty of ſpirit,</hi> is with them ſtupidity and dulneſs. Nay, it is well if they paſs ſo favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a judgment upon it; if they do not vote it to be mere moping and melancholy, if not down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right lunacy and diſtraction. And it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at all, that this judgment ſhould be paſſed by thoſe who know not God.

See, we are on the point of being daſned in pieces! Another ſtep, and we fall into that huge abyſs. Stop! I will not go on for all the world." When the other, who ſeemed to himſelf at leaſt equally ſharp-ſighted, looked forward and ſaw nothing of all this; what would he think of his companion? But that he

                     <p n="8">8. But let not the children of God, <hi>the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Sion,</hi> be moved by any of theſe things. Ye whoſe eyes are enlightened, be not troubled by thoſe who walk on ſtill in darkneſs. Ye do not walk on in a vain ſhadow: God and eternity are real things.

2. But who are the meek? Not thoſe who grieve at nothing, becauſe they know nothing; who are not diſcompoſed at the evils that occur, becauſe they diſcern not evil from good. Not thoſe who are ſheltered from the ſhocks of life, by a ſtupid inſenſibility; who have either by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or art, the virtue of ſtocks and ſtones, and reſent nothing, becauſe they feel nothing. Brute philoſophers are wholly unconcerned in this matter. Apathy is as far from meekneſs as from humanity. So that one would not eaſily conceive, how any chriſtians of the purer ages, eſpecially any of the fathers of the church, could confound theſe, and miſtake one of the fouleſt errors of heatheniſm, for a branch of true chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nor does chriſtian meekneſs imply, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without zeal for God, any more than it does ignorance or inſenſibility. No; it keeps clear of every extreme, whether in exceſs or defect. It does not deſtroy but balance the affections, which the God of Nature never deſigned ſhould be rooted out by grace, but only brought and kept under due regulations. It poiſes the mind aright. It holds an even ſcale, with regard to anger, and ſorrow, and fear: preſerving the mean in every circumſtance of life, and not declining either to the right-hand or the left.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Meekneſs therefore ſeems properly to relate to ourſelves. But it may be referred either to God or our neighbour. When this due compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of mind has reference to God, it is uſually termed reſignation; a calm acquieſcence in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is his will concerning us, even though it may not be pleaſing to nature; ſaying continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028060_0324_0FD68CEC9628D618"/>
                        <hi>It is the Lord; let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> When we conſider it more ſtrictly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ourſelves, we ſtile it patience or content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. When it is exerted toward other men, then it is mildneſs to the good, and gentleneſs to the evil.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They who are truly meek, can clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what is evil; and they can alſo ſuffer it. They are <hi>ſenſible</hi> of every thing of this kind; but ſtill meekneſs holds the reins. They are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>zealous for the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> but their zeal is always guided by knowledge, and tempered in every thought, and word, and work, with the love of man as well as the love of God. They do not deſire to extinguiſh any of the paſſions, which God has for wiſe ends implanted in their nature. But they have the maſtery of all; they hold them all in ſubjection, and employ them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſubſervience to thoſe ends. And thus even the harſher and more unpleaſing paſſions, are applicable to the nobleſt purpoſes. Even hate, and anger, and fear, when engaged againſt ſin, and regulated by faith, and love, are as walls and bulwarks to the ſoul, ſo that the wicked one cannot approach to hurt it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is evident, this divine temper, is not only to abide, but to increaſe in us day by day. Occaſions of exerciſing, and thereby increaſing it, will never be wanting while we remain upon earth. We <hi>have need of patience, that after</hi> we <hi>have done</hi> and ſuffered <hi>the will of God,</hi> we <hi>may receive the promiſe.</hi> We have need of reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may in all circumſtances ſay, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And we have need of <hi>gentleneſs toward all men;</hi> but eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028060_0325_0FD68CEE1304DDB0"/>the evil and unthankful: otherwiſe we ſhall be overcome of evil, inſtead of overcoming evil with good.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Nor does meekneſs reſtrain only the outward act, as the ſcribes and phariſees taught of old, and the miſerable teachers, who are not taught of God, will not fail to do in all ages. Our Lord guards us againſt this, and ſhews the true extent of it in the following words: <hi>Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not kill; and whoſoever ſhall kill, ſhall be in danger of the judgment,</hi> Ver. 21, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after</hi> this: in order fully to underſtand which expreſſion, we ſhould obſerve, Firſt, That hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt are the ſtrongeſt of all our bodily appetites. In like manner this hunger in the ſoul, this thirſt after the image of God, is the ſtrongeſt of all our ſpirituall appetites, when it is once awakened in the heart: yea, it ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up all the reſt in that one great deſire, to he renewed after the likeneſs of him that created us. We ſhould, ſecondly, obſerve, that from the time we begin to hunger and thirſt, thoſe appetites do not ceaſe but are more and more craving and importunate, till we either eat and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028060_0331_0FD68CFC5395AFE8"/>drink or die. And even ſo, from the time that we begin to hunger and thirſt after the whole mind which was in Chriſt, theſe ſpiritual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites do not ceaſe, but cry after their food with more and more importunity. Nor can they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ceaſe, before they are ſatisfied, while there is any ſpiritual life remaining. We may, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, obſerve, That hunger and thirſt are ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with nothing but meat and drink. If you would give to him that is hungry all the world beſide, all the elegance of apparel, all the trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of ſtate, all the treaſure upon earth, yea thouſands of gold and ſilver: if you would pay him ever ſo much honour, he regards it not; all theſe things are then of no account with him. He would ſtill ſay, theſe are not the things I want; give me food, or elſe I die. The very ſame is the caſe with every ſoul that truly hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and thirſts after righteouſneſs. He can find no comfort in any thing but this; he can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with nothing elſe. Whatever you offer beſides, it is lightly eſteemed; whether it be riches, or honour, or pleaſure, he ſtill ſays, this is not the thing which I want. Give me love or elſe I die!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And it is as impoſſible to ſatisfy ſuch a ſoul, a ſoul that is a-thirſt for God, the living God, with what the world accounts religion, as with what they account happineſs. The religion of the world implies three things; Firſt, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no harm, the abſtaining from outward ſin; at leaſt from ſuch as is ſcandalous, as robbery, theft, common ſwearing, drunkenneſs; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The doing good, the relieving the poor, the being charitable, as it is called: Thirdly, The
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028060_0332_0FD68CFC57D99358"/>uſing the means of grace; at leaſt, the going to church and to the Lord's ſupper. He in whom theſe three marks are found, is termed by the world a religious man. But will this ſatisfy him who hungers after God? No. It is not food for his ſoul. He wants a religion of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler kind, a religion higher and deeper than this. He can no more feed on this poor, ſhallow, formal thing, than he can <hi>fill his belly with the eaſt-wind.</hi> True, he is careful to abſtain from the very appearance of evil: he is zealous of good works. He attends all the ordinances of God. But all this is not what he longs for. This is only the outſide of that religion, which he inſatiably hungers after. The knowledge of God in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>the Life which is hid with</hi> Chriſt <hi>in</hi> God, the being <hi>joined unto the</hi> Lord in <hi>one ſpirit,</hi> the having <hi>fellowſhip with the Father and the Son;</hi> the <hi>walking in the light as</hi> God <hi>is in the light,</hi> the being <hi>purified even as he is pure:</hi> this is the religion, the righteouſneſs he thirſts after.

                     <p>The pure in heart ſee all things full of God.

<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028060_0357_0FD68D33F5E74548"/>Paul</hi> in the titles of his epiſtles, wiſhes <hi>grace and peace</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> or the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> it is as if he had ſaid, "As a fruit of the free, undeſerved love and favour of God, may you enjoy all bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſpiritual and temporal, all the good things which God hath prepared for them that love him."</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence we may eaſily learn, in how wide a ſenſe, the term <hi>peace-makers</hi> is to be underſtood. In its literal meaning it implies, thoſe lovers of God and man, who utterly deteſt and abhor all ſtrife and debate, all variance and contention: and accordingly labour with all their might either to prevent this fire of hell from being kindled, or when it is kindled, from breaking out, or when it is broke out, from ſpreading any farther. They endeavour to calm the ſtormy ſpirits of men, to quiet their turbulent paſſions, to ſoften the minds of contending parties, and, if poſſible, reconcile them to each other. They uſe all innocent arts, and employ all their ſtrength, all the talents which God has given them, as well to preſerve peace, where it is, as to reſtore it, where it is not. It is the joy of then heart, to promote, to confirm, to increaſe mutual good-will among men: but more eſpecially among the children of God, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſtinguiſhed by things of ſmaller importance. That as they have all <hi>one</hi> Lord, <hi>one faith;</hi> as they <hi>are</hi> all <hi>called in one hope of their calling,</hi> ſo they may all <hi>walk worthy of the vocation wherewith they are called: with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to keep the unity of the ſpirit, in the bond of peace.</hi>

4.

He doth good to them all, as he hath opportunity, that is on every poſſible occaſion; <hi>redeeming the time,</hi> in order thereto, <hi>buying up every opportunity,</hi> improving every hour, loſing no moment wherein he may profit another. He does good, not of one particular kind, but good in general: in every poſſible way, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying herein all his talents of every kind; all his powers and faculties of body and ſoul; all his fortune, his intereſt, his reputation; deſiring only, that when his Lord cometh he may ſay, "Well done, good and faithful ſervant!"</p>

                     <p n="3">3. If it be, Secondly, enquired, why they are perſecuted? the anſwer is equally plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. It is <hi>for righteouſneſs ſake;</hi> becauſe they are righteous; becauſe they are <hi>born after the ſpirit;</hi> becauſe they <hi>will live godly in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus; becauſe they <hi>are not of the world.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028060_0362_0FD68D3FD36D9648"/>may be pretended, this is the real cauſe: be their inſirmities more or leſs, ſtill if it were not for this, they would be borne with, and the world would love its own. They are perſecuted, becauſe they are <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> that is, ſay the world, "Boor-ſpirited, mean, daſtardly ſouls, good for nothing, not fit to live in the world!" becauſe they mourn; "They are ſuch dull heavy, lumpiſh creatures, enough to ſink any one's ſpirite that ſees them! they are mere deaths-heads; they kill innocent mirth, and ſpoil company wherever they come:" becauſe they are <hi>meek;</hi> "tame, paſſive fools, juſt fit to be tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon:" becauſe they <hi>hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs;</hi> "A parcel of hot-brained enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, gaping after they know not what, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with rational religion, but running mad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter raptures and inwards feelings:" becauſe they are merciful, lovers of all, lovers of the evil and unthankful: "Encouraging all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; nay, tempting people to do miſchief by impunity: and men who, it is to be feared, have their own religion ſtill to ſeek; very looſe in their-principles:" becauſe they are pure in heart? "Uncharitable creatures! that damn all the world, but thoſe that are of their own ſort! blaſphemous wretches, that pretend to make God a har, to live without ſin!" above all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are peace-makers, becauſe they take all opportunities of doing good to all men. This is the grand reaſon why they have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in all ages, and will be till the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things.</p>
                     <p>"If they would but keep their religion to themſelves, it would be tolerable. But it is this
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028060_0363_0FD68D4363CBE8F0"/>ſpreading their errors, this infecting ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which is not to be endured. They do ſo much miſchief in the world, that they ought to be tolerated no longer. It is true, the men do ſome things well enough; they relieve ſome of the poor. But this too, is only done to gain the more to their party; and ſo, in effect, to do the more miſchief." Thus the men of the world ſincerely think and ſpeak. And the more the kingdom of God prevails, the more the peace-makers are enabled to propagate lowlineſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all other divine tempers; the more miſchief is done, in their account. Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the more are they enraged, againſt the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this, and the more vehemently will they perſecute them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let us, Thirdly, enquire, who are they that perſecute them? St. Paul anſwers, <hi>he that is born after the fleſh;</hi> every one who is not <hi>born of the ſpirit,</hi> or at leaſt, deſirous ſo to be: all that do not, at leaſt, labour to <hi>live godly in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus: all that are not <hi>paſſed from death unto life,</hi> and conſequently cannot <hi>love the brethren: the world,</hi> that is according to our ſaviour's account, <hi>they who know not him that ſent me:</hi> they who know not God, even the loving, pardoning God, by the teaching of his own ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon is plain. The ſpirit which is in the world is directly oppoſite to the ſpirit which is of God. It muſt therefore needs be that thoſe who are of the world, will be oppoſite to thoſe who are of God. There is the utmoſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety between them, in all their opinions, their deſires, deſigns, and tempers. And hitherto

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (were it only on this account) all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of the devil, will perſecute the children of God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Should it be enquired, fourthly, how they will perſecute them? it may be anſwered in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, juſt in that manner and meaſure which the wiſe diſpoſer of all, ſees will be moſt for his glory; will tend moſt to his children's growth in grace, and the enlargement of his own kingdom. There is no one branch of God's government of the world, which is more to be admired than this. His car is never heavy to the threatnings of the perſecutor, or the cry of the perſecuted. His eye is ever open, and his hand ſtretched out, to direct every, the minuteſt circumſtance. When the ſtorm ſhall begin, how high it ſhall riſe, which way it ſhall point its courſe, when and how it ſhall end, are all determined by his uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wiſdom. The ungodly are only a ſword of his: an inſtrument which he uſes, as it pleaſeth him, and which itſelf, when the gracious ends of his providence are anſwered, is caſt into the fire.</p>
                     <p>At ſome rare times, as when chriſtianity was planted firſt, and while it was taking root in the earth; as alſo when the pure doctrine of Chriſt began to be planted again in our nation: God permitted the ſtorm to riſe high, and his children were called to reſiſt unto blood. There was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028060_0365_0FD68D47C2131120"/>reaſon why he ſuffered this with regard to the apoſtles, that their evidence might be the more unexceptionable. But from the annals of the church, we learn another, and a far different reaſon, why he ſuffered the heavy perſecutions which aroſe in the ſecond and third centuries: namely, becauſe the myſtery of iniquity did ſo ſtrongly work, becauſe of the monſtrous corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which even then reigned in the church: theſe God chaſtiſed, and at the ſame time ſtrove to heal, by thoſe ſevere but neceſſary viſitations.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the ſame: obſervation may be made, with regard to the grand perſecution in our own land. God had dealt very graciouſly with out nation; he had poured out various bleſſings upon us. He had given us peace abroad and at home; and a king wiſe and good, beyond his years. And above all, he had cauſed the pure light of his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to ariſe and ſhine amongſt us. But what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn did he find? <hi>be looked for righteouſneſs. But behold a cry!</hi> a cry of oppreſſion and wrong, of ambition and injuſtice, of malice and fraud and covetouſneſs. Yea, the cry of thoſe who even then expired in the flames, entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth. It was then God aroſe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own cauſe, againſt thoſe that held the truth in unrighteouſneſs. Then he ſold them into the hands of their perſecutors, by a judgment mixt with mercy: an affliction to puniſh and yet a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to heal the grievous backſlidings of his people.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But it is ſeldom God ſuffers the ſtorm to riſe ſo high, as torture or death or bonds or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment. Whereas his children are frequently called to endure thoſe lighter kinds of perſecution; they frequently ſuffer the eſtrangement of kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks;
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028060_0366_0FD68D4997BF5C68"/>the loſs of the friends that were as their own ſoul. They find the truth of their Lord's word (concerning the event, though not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his coming) * <hi>Suppoſe ye that I am come to give peace upon earth? I tell you nay; but rather diviſion.</hi> And hence will naturally follow loſs of buſineſs or employment, and conſequently of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But all theſe circumſtances likewiſe are under the wiſe direction of God, who allots to every one what is moſt expedient for him.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But the perſecution which attends all the children of God, is that our Lord deſcribes in the following words, <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you and perſecute you</hi> (ſhall perſecute, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling you) <hi>and ſay all manner of evil againſt you, falſely, for my ſake.</hi> This cannot fail: it is the very badge of our diſcipleſhip: it is one of the ſeals of our calling. It is a ſure portion, entailed on all the children of God: if we have it not, we are baſtards and not ſons. Strait thro' <hi>evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> as well as <hi>good report,</hi> lies the only way to the Kingdom. The meek, ſerious, humble, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous lovers of God and man, are of good report among their brethren; but of evil report with the world, who count and treat them <hi>as the filth and off-ſcouring of all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Indeed ſome have ſuppoſed, that before the fulneſs of the gentiles ſhall come in, the ſcandal of the croſs will ceaſe: that God will cauſe chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to be eſteemed and loved, even by thoſe who are as yet in their ſins. Yea, and ſure it is, that even now, he at ſometimes ſuſpends the contempt as well as the fierceneſs of men: <hi>be makes a man's enemies to be at peace with him</hi> for a ſeaſon,<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xii. 51.</note>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:028060_0367_0FD68D4C54E647E0"/>and gives him favour with his bittereſt perfecutors But ſetting aſide this exempt caſe, <hi>the ſcandal of the croſs is</hi> not yet <hi>ceaſed:</hi> but a man may ſay ſtill, <hi>if I pleaſe men, I am not the ſervant of</hi> Chriſt: let no man therefore regard that pleaſing ſuggeſtion (pleaſing doubtleſs to fleſh and blood) "That bad men only <hi>pretend</hi> to hate and depiſe them that are good, but do indeed love and eſteem them in their hearts." Not ſo: they may employ them ſometimes; but it is for their own profit. They may put confidence in them; for they know their ways are not like other men's. But ſtill they love them not; unleſs ſo far as the ſpirit of God may be ſtriving with them. Our Saviour's words are expreſs: <hi>if ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but becauſe ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> Yea (ſetting aſide what exceptions may be made by the preventing grace or the peculiar providence of God) it hateth them as cordially and ſincerely, as ever it did their maſter.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. It remains only to enquire, how are the children of God to behave, with regard to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? and firſt, they ought not knowingly or deſignedly, to bring it upon themſelves. This is contrary both to the example and advice of our Lord and all his apoſtles; who teach us not only not to ſeck, but to avoid it, as far as we can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring our conſcience; without giving up any part of that righteouſneſs, which we are to prefer before life itſelf.

This inward religion bears the ſhape of God, ſo viſibly impreſſed upon it, that a ſoul muſt be wholly immerſed in fleſh and blood, when he can doubt of its divine original.

If religion therefore were carried no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than this, they could have no doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: they ſhould have no objection againſt purſuing it with the whole ardor of their ſouls.

<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028060_0376_0FD68D616BA101A0"/>ourſelves at all about externals, we ſhould only commune with God in our hearts?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Many eminent men have ſpoken thus; have adviſed us "To ceaſe from all outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;" wholly to withdraw from the world; to leave the body behind us; to abſtract ourſelves from all ſenſible things: to have no concern at all about outward religion, but to "work all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in the will," as the far more excellent way, more perfective of the ſoul, as well as more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It needed not that any ſhould tell our Lord, of this maſter-piece of the wiſdom from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath! this faireſt of all the devices wherewith <hi>ſatan</hi> hath ever perverted the right ways of the Lord.

                     <p n="6">6. But has our Lord been wanting on his part? has he not ſufficently guarded us againſt this pleaſing deluſion? has he not armed us here with armour of proof againſt ſatan <hi>transformed into an angel of light?</hi> yea, verily: he here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, in the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt manner, the active, patient religion he had juſt deſcribed: what can be fuller and plainer than the words he immediately ſubjoins, to what he had ſaid of doing and ſuffering? <hi>ye are the ſalt of the earth.

                     <p>In order fully to explain and enforce theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant words, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, Firſt, that chriſtianity is eſſentially a ſocial religion, and that to turn it into a ſolitary one, is to deſtroy it: Secondly, that to conceal this religion is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as well as utterly contrary to the deſign of its author. I ſhall, Thirdly, anſwer ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; and conclude the whole with a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical application.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. 1. Firſt, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that chriſtianity is eſſentially a ſocial religion; and that to turn it into a ſolitary religion, is indeed to deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p>By chriſtianity I mean, that method of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God, which is here revealed to man by Jeſus Chriſt. When I ſay, this is eſſentially a ſocial religion, I mean not only, that it cannot ſubſiſt ſo well, but that it cannot ſubſiſt at all without ſociety, without living and converſing with other men. And in ſhewing this, I ſhall confine myſelf to thoſe conſiderations, which will ariſe from the very diſcourſe before us. But if this be ſhewn, then doubtleſs to turn this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into a ſolitary one, is to deſtroy it.</p>

                        </gap> we can in any wiſe condemn the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing ſolitude or retirement with ſociety. This is not only allowable, but expedient: nay, it is neceſſary as daily experience ſhews, for every one that either already is, or deſires to be a real chriſtian. It can hardly be that we ſhould ſpend one entire day, in a continued intercourſe with men, without ſuffering loſs in our ſoul, and in ſome meaſure grieving the holy ſpirit of God. We have need daily to retire from the world, at leaſt, morning and evening, to converſe with God, to commune more freely with our Father which is in ſecret. Nor indeed can a man of experience condemn, even longer ſeaſons of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious retirement, ſo they do not imply any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the worldly employ, wherein the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God has placed us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet ſuch retirement muſt not ſwallow up all our time; this would be to deſtroy, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance true religion. For, that the religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by our Lord in the foregoing words, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without ſociety, without our living and converſing with other men, is manifeſt from hence, that ſeveral of the moſt eſſential branches thereof, can have no place, if we have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is no diſpoſition (for inſtance) which is more eſſential to chriſtianity than meekneſs. Now altho' this, as it implies reſignation to God, or patience in pain and ſickneſs, may ſubſiſt in a deſert, in a hermit's cell, in total ſolitude; yet as it implies (which it no leſs neceſſarily does) mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gentleneſs and long-ſuffering, it cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have a being, it has no place under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without an intercourſe with other men.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028060_0379_0FD68D67EF5A7790"/>So that to attempt turning this into a ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtue, is to deſtroy it from the face of the earth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another neceſſary branch of true chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, is peace-making, or doing of good. That this is equally eſſential with any of the other parts of the religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there can be no ſtronger argument to evince (and therefore it would be abſurd to allege any other) than that it is here inſerted in the original plan he has laid down, of the fundamentals of his religion. Therefore to ſet aſide this, is the ſame daring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſait on the authority of our great maſter, as to ſet aſide mercifulneſs, purity of heart, or any other branch of his inſtitution. But this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſet aſide, by all who call us to the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; who recommend entire ſolitude either to the babes, or the young men, or the fathers in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For will any man affirm, that a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary chriſtian (ſo called, tho' it is little leſs than a contradiction in terms) can be a merciful man? that is, one that takes every opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all good to all men? what can be more plain, than that this fundamental branch of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſociety, without our living and converſing with other men?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But is it not expedient however (one might naturally aſk) to converſe only with good men? only with thoſe whom we know to be meek and merciful; holy of heart and holy of life? is it not expedient to refrain from any converſation or intercourſe, with men of the oppoſite charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? men who do not obey, perhaps do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? the

This is the great reaſon why the Providence of God has ſo mingled you together with other men, that whatever grace you have received of God may through you be communicated to others; that every holy temper, and word, and work of yours, may have an influence on them alſo. By this means a check will in ſome meaſure be given to the corruption which is in the world; and a ſmall part, at leaſt, ſaved from the general infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rendered holy and pure before God.</p>

That we may the more diligently labour to ſeaſon all we can, with every holy and heavenly temper, our Lord proceeds to ſhew the deſperate ſtate of thoſe, who do not impart the religion they have received; which indeed they cannot poſſibly fail to do, ſo long as it remains in their own hearts. <hi>If the ſalt hath loſt its ſavour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall it be ſalted?

                     <p n="2">2. Of this plauſible reaſoning of fleſh and blood, our Lord was well aware alſo. And he has given a full anſwer to it in thoſe words, which come now to be conſidered: in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, as I propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do in the ſecond place, that ſo long as true religion abides in our hearts, it is impoſſible to conceal it, as well as abſolutely contrary to the deſign of its great author.</p>
                     <p>And, Firſt, It is impoſſible for any that have it, to conceal the religion of Jeſus Chriſt. This our Lord makes plain beyond all contradiction, by a two-fold compariſon. <hi>Ye are the light of the world. A city ſet upon an hill cannot be hid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ye</hi> chriſtians <hi>are the light of the world,</hi> with regard both to your tempers and actions. Your holineſs makes you as conſpicuous, as the ſun in the midſt of heaven. As ye cannot go out of the world, ſo neither can ye ſtay in it, without appearing to all mankind. Ye may not flee from men, and while ye are among them, it is impoſſible to hide your lowlineſs and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thoſe other diſpoſitions whereby ye aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to be perfect, as your Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is perfect. Love cannot be hid any more than light; and leaſt of all, when it ſhines forth in action; when ye exerciſe yourſelves in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love, in beneficence of every kind. As well may men think to hide a city, as to hide a chriſtian: yea, as well may they conceal a
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028060_0386_0FD68D79B63E8D08"/>city ſet upon a hill, as a holy, zealous, active lover of God and man.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is true, men who love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil, will take all poſſible pains to prove, that the light which is in you is darkneſs. They will ſay evil, all manner of evil, falſely, of the good which is in you: they will lay to your charge that which is fartheſt from your thoughts, which is the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of all you are and all you do. And your patient continuance in well-doing, your meek ſuffering all things for the Lord's ſake, your calm, humble joy in the midſt of perſecution, your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labour to overcome evil with good, will make you ſtill more viſible and conſpicuous than ye were before.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. So impoſſible it is, to keep our religion from being ſeen, unleſs we caſt it away: ſo vain is the thought, of hiding the light, unleſs by putting it out. Sure it is, that a ſecret, unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved religion cannot be the religion of Jeſus Chriſt. Whatever religion can be concealed, is not chriſtianity. If a chriſtian could be hid, he could not be compared to a city ſet upon an hill; to the light of the world, the ſun ſhining from heaven, and ſeen by all the world below. Never therefore let it enter into the heart of him whom God hath renewed in the ſpirit of his mind, to hide that light, to keep his religion to himſelf; eſpecially conſidering it is not only impoſſible to conceal true chriſtianity, but likewiſe abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the deſign of the great author of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This plainly appears from the following words: <hi>neither do men light a candle to put it
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028060_0387_0FD68D7B449CE880"/>under a buſhel.</hi> As if he had ſaid, as men do not light a candle, only to cover and conceal it, ſo neither does God enlighten any ſoul with his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious knowledge and love, to have it covered or concealed, either by prudence, falſely ſo called, or ſhame, or voluntary humility: to have it hid either in a deſert, or in the world; either by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding men, or in converſing with them. <hi>But they put it on a candleſtick, and it giveth light to all that are in the houſe.</hi> In like manner, it is the deſign of God, that every chriſtian ſhould be in an open point of view: that he may give light to all around, that he may viſibly expreſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thus hath God in all ages ſpoken to the world, not only by precept but by example alſo. He hath <hi>not left himſelf without witneſs</hi> in any nation, where the ſound of the goſpel had gone forth, without a few who teſtified his truth, by their lives as well as their words. Theſe have been <hi>as lights ſhining in a dark place.</hi> And from time to time they have been the means of enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening ſome, of preſerving a remnant, a little ſeed, which was <hi>counted unto the</hi> Lord <hi>for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> They have led a few poor ſheep out of the darkneſs of the world, and guided their feet into the way of peace.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. One might imagine, that where both ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the reaſon of things ſpeak ſo clearly and expreſsly, there could not be much advanced on the other ſide, at leaſt, not with any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of truth. But they who imagine thus, know little of the depths of <hi>Satan.</hi> After all that ſcripture and reaſon have ſaid, ſo exceeding plauſible are the pretences for ſolitary religion,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028060_0388_0FD68D7CA7040D68"/>for a chriſtian's going out of the world, or at leaſt hiding himſelf in it, that we need all the wiſdom of God to ſee through the ſnare, and all the power of God to eſcape it: ſo many and ſtrong are the objections which have been brought, againſt being ſocial, open, active chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. 1. To anſwer theſe was the third thing which I propoſed. And, firſt, it has been often objected, that religion does not lie in outward things, but in the heart, the inmoſt ſoul: that it is the union of the ſoul with God, the life of God in the ſoul of man: that outſide religion is nothing worth; ſeeing God <hi>delighteth not in burnt-offerings,</hi> in outward ſervices, but a pure and holy heart is the <hi>ſacrifice he will not deſpiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, it is moſt true, that the root of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion lies in the heart, in the inmoſt ſoul: that this is, the union of the ſoul with God; the life of God in the ſoul of man. But if this root be really in the heart, it cannot but put forth branches. And theſe are, the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of outward obedience, which partake of the ſame nature with the root; and conſequently, are not only marks or ſigns, but ſubſtantial parts of religion.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo true, that bare outſide religion, which has no root in the heart, is nothing worth; that God delighteth not in <hi>ſuch</hi> outward ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, no more than in Jewiſh burnt-offerings, and that a pure and holy heart is a ſacrifice, with which he is always well pleaſed. But he is alſo well pleaſed with all that outward ſervice, which
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028060_0389_0FD68D7E18E73A98"/>ariſes from the heart: with the ſacrifice of our prayers (whether public or private) of our p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ſes and thankſgivings: with the ſacrifice of our goods, humbly devoted to him, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly to his glory: and with that of our bodies, which he peculiarly claims; which the apoſtle <hi>beſeeches</hi> us, <hi>by the mercies of</hi> God, <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto him, a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable to</hi> God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſecond objection, nearly related to this is, that love is all in all: that it is <hi>the fulfilling of the ſaw, the end of the commandment,</hi> of every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God: that all we do and all we ſuffer, if we have not charity, or love, profiteth us nothing: and therefore the apoſtle directs us, <hi>to follow after charity,</hi> and terms this, <hi>the more excellent way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, it is granted, that the love of God and man, ariſing from <hi>faith unfeigned,</hi> is all in all, the fulfilling of the law, the end of every commandment of God. It is true, that without this whatever we do, whatever we ſuffer profits us nothing. But it does not follow, that love is all in ſuch a ſenſe, as to ſupe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cede either faith or good works. It is <hi>the fulfilling of the law,</hi> not by releaſing us from, but by conſtraining us to obey it. It is <hi>the end of the commandment,</hi> as every commandment leads to and centres in it. It is allowed, that whatever we do or ſuffer, without love, profits us nothing. But withal whatever we do or ſuffer in love, though it were only the ſuffering reproach for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cup of cold water in his name, it ſhall in no wiſe loſe its reward.</p>

3. "But does not the apoſtle direct us, to <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after charity?</hi> And does he not term it, <hi>a more excellent way?</hi>"—He does direct us to <hi>follow after charity.</hi> But not after that alone. His words are,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv. 1.</note>

                     <p>In the ſame verſe alſo, wherein he terms this, The way of love, <hi>a more excellent way,</hi> he directs the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to deſire other gifts beſides it: yea, to deſire them earneſtly.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. xii. 31.</note>

Than the gifts of <hi>healing,</hi> of <hi>ſpeaking with tongues,</hi> and of <hi>interpreting,</hi> mentioned in the preceding verſe. But not more excellent than the way of obedience. Of this the apoſtle is not ſpeaking. Neither is he ſpeaking of outward religion at all. So that this text is quite wide of the preſent queſtion.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe the apoſtle had been ſpeaking of outward as well as inward religion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them together: ſuppoſe in the compariſon he had given the preference ever ſo much to the latter: ſuppoſe he had preferred (as he juſtly might) a loving heart, before all outward works whatever: Yet it would not follow, that we were to reject, either one or the other. No; God hath joined them together from the beginning of the world. And let not man put them aſunder.</p>

4. "But God <hi>is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> And is not this enough? Nay, ought we not to employ the whole ſtrength of our mind herein? Does not attending to outward things, clog the ſoul, that it cannot ſoar aloft in holy contemplation? Does it not damp the vigour of our thought? Has it not a natural tendency, to incumber and diſtract the mind? Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have us <hi>to be without carefulneſs,</hi> and to <hi>wait upon the</hi> Lord <hi>without diſtraction.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, God is a Spirit, and they that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth. Yea, and this is enough: we ought to employ the whole ſtrength of our mind therein. But then I would aſk, What is it to worſhip God, a Spirit, in ſpirit and in truth? Why, it is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him with our ſpirit; to worſhip him in that manner, which none but ſpirits are capable of. It is, to believe in him, as a wiſe, juſt, holy Being, of purer eyes than to behold iniquity: and yet merciful, gracious, and long-ſuffering; forgiving iniquity and tranſgreſſion and ſin: caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our ſins behind his back, and accepting us in the beloved. It is, To love him, to delight in him, to deſire him, with all our heart, and mind, and ſoul, and ſtrength: to imitate him we love, by purifying ourſelves, even as he is pure; and to obey him whom we love and in whom we believe, both in thought, and word, and work. Conſequently, one branch of the worſhipping God in ſpirit and in truth, is the keeping his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward commandments. To glorify him therefore with our bodies as well as with our ſpirits, to go
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028060_0392_0FD68D8A51F22978"/>thro' outward work with hearts lifted up to him, to make our daily employment a ſacrifice to God; to buy and ſell, to eat and drink to his glory: this is worſhipping God in ſpirit and in truth, as much as the praying to him in a wilderneſs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But if ſo, then contemplation is only one way of worſhipping God in ſpirit and in truth. Therefore to give ourſelves up entirely to this, would be to deſtroy many branches of ſpiritual worſhip, all equally acceptable to God, and equally profitable, not hurtful, to the ſoul. For it is a great miſtake to ſuppoſe, that an attention to thoſe outward things, whereto the providence of God hath called us, is any clog to a chriſtian, or any hinderance at all to his always ſeeing him that is inviſible. It does not at all damp the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his thought, it does not incumber or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract his mind; it gives him no uneaſy or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful care, who does it all as unto the Lord: who hath learned, whatſoever he doth in word or deed, to do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus: having only one eye of the ſoul, which moves round on outward things, and one immovably fixed on God. Learn what this meaneth, ye poor recluſes, that you may clearly diſcern your own littleneſs of faith. Yea, that you may no longer judge others by yourſelves, go and learn what that meaneth:

We at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on all the ordinances: but we were no better for it; nor indeed any one elſe: nay we were the worſe. For we fancied ourſelves chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for ſo doing, when we knew not what chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity meant."</p>
                     <p>I allow the fact. I allow that you and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more have thus abuſed the ordinances of God: miſtaking the means for the end: ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that the doing theſe, or ſome other outward works, either was the religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or would be accepted in the place of it. But let the abuſe be taken away and the uſe remain. Now uſe all outward things; but uſe them with a conſtant eye to the renewal of your ſoul in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But this is not all. They affirm, "Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience likewiſe ſhews, that the trying to do good is but loſt labour: what does it avail to feed or cloath men's bodies, if they are juſt dropping into everlaſting fire? and what good can any man do to their ſouls? if theſe are changed, God doth it himſelf. Beſides, all men are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good, at leaſt deſirous ſo to be, or obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately evil. Now the former have no need of us. Let them aſk help of God, and it ſhall be
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028060_0394_0FD68D8E93644F48"/>given them. And the latter will receive no help from us. Nay, and our Lord forbids, to <hi>caſt our pearls before ſwine.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, 1. Whether they will finally be loſt or ſaved, you are expreſsly commanded to feed the hungry and cloath the naked. If you can, and do not, whatever becomes of them, you ſhall go away into everlaſting fire. 2. Though it is God only changes hearts, yet he generally doth it by man. It is our part to do all that in us lies, as diligently as if we could change them ourſelves, and then to leave the event to him. 3. God in anſwer to their prayers, builds up his children by each other in every good gift; nouriſhing and ſtrengthening the whole <hi>body, by that which every joint ſupplieth.</hi> So that <hi>the eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee;</hi> no, nor even <hi>the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</hi> Laſtly, how are you aſſured, that the perſons before you are dogs or ſwine? judge them not, until you have tried. <hi>How knoweſt thou, O man, but thou mayeſt gain thy brother?</hi> but thou mayeſt under God, ſave his ſoul from death? when he ſpurns thy love and blaſphemes the good word, then it is time to give him up to God.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. "We have tried. We have laboured to reform ſinners. And what did it avail? on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we could make no impreſſion at all: and if ſome were changed for a while, yet their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was but as the morning dew; and they were ſoon as bad, nay, worſe than ever. So that we only hurt them—and ourſelves too; for our minds were hurried and diſcompoſed; perhaps filled with anger inſtead of love. Therefore
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028060_0395_0FD68D944D67F220"/>we had better have kept our religion to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."</p>
                     <p>It is very poſſible this fact alſo may be true: that you have tried to do good and have not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; yea, that thoſe who ſeemed reformed, relapſed into ſin, and their laſt ſtate was worſe than the firſt. And what marvel? is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant above his maſter? but how often did he ſtrive to ſave ſinners: and they would not hear: or when they had followed him a while, they turned back as a dog to his vomit. But he did not therefore deſiſt from ſtriving to do good: no more ſhould you, whatever your ſucceſs be. It is your part, to do as you are commanded: the event is in the hand of God. You are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for this: leave it to him, who orders all things well. <hi>In the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening withold not thy hand; for thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not whether ſhall proſper,</hi> Eccleſ. ix. 6.</p>
                     <p>"But the trial hurries and frets your own ſoul." Perhaps it did ſo for this very reaſon, becauſe you thought you was accountable for the event, which no man is, nor indeed can be. Or perhaps, becauſe you was off your guard; you was not watchful ever your own ſpirit. But this is no reaſon for diſobeying God. Try again; but try more warily than before. Do good (as you forgive) <hi>not ſeven times only; but until ſeventy times ſeven.</hi> Only be wiſer by experience: at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it every time more cautiouſly than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Be more humbled before God, more deeply convinced, that of yourſelf you can do nothing. Be more jealous over your own ſpirit:
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028060_0396_0FD68D9753B2D4D8"/>more gentle and watchful unto prayer. Thus <hi>caſt your bread upon the waters, and you ſhall find it again after many days.</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028060_0405_0FD68DAC33A53100"/>themſelves greatly) that "no part of the law was to paſs away, till <hi>all the law</hi> was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but it has been fulfilled by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now muſt paſs, for the goſpel to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed." Not ſo; the word <hi>all</hi> does not mean all the law, but all things in the univerſe; as neither has the term <hi>fulfilled,</hi> any reference to the law, but to all things in heaven and earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From all this we may learn, that there is no contrariety at all, between the law and the goſpel; that there is no need for the law to paſs away, in order to the eſtabliſhing the goſpel. Indeed neither of them ſupercedes the other, but they agree perfectly well together. Yea, the very ſame words, conſidered in different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, are parts both of the law and of the goſpel: if they are conſidered as commandments, they are parts of the law; if as promiſes, of the goſpel. Thus, <hi>thou ſhalt love the</hi> Lord <hi>thy</hi> God <hi>with all thy heart,</hi> when conſidered as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is a branch of the law; when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as a promiſe, is an eſſential part of the goſpel: the goſpel being no other than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the law, propoſed by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Accordingly poverty of ſpirit, purity of heart, and whatever elſe is enjoined in the holy law of God, are no other, when viewed in a goſpel light, than ſo many great and precious promiſes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is therefore the cloſeſt connexion that can be conceived, between the law and the goſpel. On the one hand, the law continually makes way for, and points us to the goſpel: on the other, the goſpel continually leads us to a
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028060_0406_0FD68DAE1530F128"/>more exact fulfilling of the law. The law, for inſtance, requires us to love God, to love our neighbour, to be meek, humble or holy: we feel that we are not ſufficient for theſe things; yea, that <hi>with man this is impoſſible.</hi> But we ſee a promiſe of God, to give us that love, and to make us humble, meek and holy. We lay hold of this goſpel, of theſe glad tidings; it is done unto us according to our faith: and <hi>the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the law is fulfilled in us,</hi> through faith which is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may yet farther obſerve, that every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in holy writ, is only a covered promiſe. For by that ſolemn declaration, <hi>this is the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant I will make after thoſe days, ſaith the</hi> Lord, <hi>I will put my laws in your minds, and write them in your hearts,</hi> God hath engaged to give whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he commands. Does he command us then to <hi>pray without ceaſing?</hi> to <hi>rejoice evermore?</hi> to be <hi>holy as he is holy?</hi> it is enough. He will work in us this very thing. It ſhall be unto us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But if theſe things are ſo, we cannot be at a loſs, what to think of thoſe who in all ages of the church, have undertaken to change or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede ſome commands of God, as they profeſſed, by the peculiar direction of his Spirit. <hi>Chriſt</hi> has here given us an infallible rule, whereby to judge of all ſuch pretenſions. Chriſtianity, as it includes the whole moral law of God, both by way of injunction and of promiſe, if we will hear him, is deſigned of God, to be the laſt of all his diſpenſations. There is no other to come after this. This is to endure till the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things. Of conſequence all ſuch
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028060_0407_0FD68DAFF34F1608"/>new revelations, are of Satan and not of God; and all pretences to another more perfect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, fall to the ground of courſe. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhall paſs away: But</hi> this <hi>word ſhall not paſs away:</hi>

                     <p>Who, what are they, that make "The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law," a character of reproach? do they not ſee on whom the reproach muſt fall? on whoſe head it muſt light at laſt? whoſoever on this ground deſpiſeth us, deſpiſeth him that ſent us.

So that no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is made for one darling luſt; no reſerve for one idol; no excuſe for refraining from all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and only giving way to one boſom ſin. What God demands is, an entire obedience; we are to have an eye to all his commandments: otherwiſe we loſe all the labour we take in keeping ſome, and our poor ſouls for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>One of theſe leaſt,</hi> or one of the leaſt of theſe <hi>commandments.</hi>—Here is another excuſe cut off, whereby many, who cannot deceive God, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deceive their own ſouls. "This ſin, ſaith the ſinner, is it not a little one? will not the Lord ſpare me in this thing? ſurely he will not be extreme to mark this, ſince I do not offend in the greater matters of the law." Vain hope! ſpeaking after the manner of men, we may term theſe great and thoſe little commandments. But in reality, they are not ſo. If we uſe propriety of ſpeech, there is no ſuch thing as a little ſin: every ſin being a tranſgreſſion of the holy and perfect law, and an affront of the great majeſty of heaven.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>And ſhall teach men ſo</hi>—In ſome ſenſe it may be ſaid, that whoſoever openly breaks any commandment, teaches others to do the ſame: for example ſpeaks, and many times louder than
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028060_0409_0FD68DB355093160"/>precept. In this ſenſe it is apparent every open drunkard, is a teacher of drunkenneſs: every ſabbath-breaker is conſtantly teaching his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to profane the day of the Lord. But this is not all; an habitual breaker of the law, is ſeldom content to ſtop here. He generally teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es other men to do ſo too, by word as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: eſpecially when he hardens his neck, and hateth to be reproved. Such a ſinner ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences an advocate for ſin: he defends what he is reſolved not to forſake. He excuſes the ſin which he will not leave, and thus directly teaches every ſin which he commits.</p>

5. Theſe are of ſeveral ſorts. Of the firſt ſort are they, who live in ſome wilful, habitual ſin. Now if an ordinary ſinner teaches by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how much more a ſinful miniſter? Even if he does not attempt to defend, excuſe or extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his ſin. If he does, he is a murderer indeed, yea, the murderer-general of his congregation. He peoples the regions of death. He is the choic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inſtrument of the prince of darkneſs. When he goes hence, <hi>hell from beneath is moved to meet him at his coming.</hi> Nor can he ſink into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, without dragging a multitude after him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Next to theſe are the good-natured, good ſort of men: who live an eaſy, harmleſs life, neither troubling themſelves with outward ſin, nor with inward holineſs: men who are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neither one way nor the other; neither for religion nor irreligion: who are very regular both in public and private; but do not pretend to be any ſtricter than their neighbours. A miniſter of this kind breaks, not one, or a few only of the leaſt commandments of God; but all the great and weighty branches of his law, which relate to the power of godlineſs: And all that require us to <hi>paſs the time of our ſojourning in fear,</hi> to <hi>work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling;</hi> to have our <hi>loins always girt and our lights burning;</hi> to ſtrive or <hi>agonize to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</hi> And he <hi>teaches men ſo,</hi> by the whole form of his life, and the general tenor of his preaching; which uniformly tends to ſooth thoſe in their pleaſing dream, who imagine themſelves chriſtians and are not; to perſuade all who attend upon his miniſtry, to ſleep on and take their reſt. No

                     <p n="7">7. But above all theſe, in the higheſt rank of the enemies of the goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are they who openly and explicitly <hi>judge the law</hi> itſelf, and <hi>ſpeak evil of the law:</hi> Who teach men to break (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to diſſolve, to looſe, to untie the obligation of) not one only, whether of the leaſt, or of the greateſt, but all the commandments at a ſtroke: who teach, without any cover, in ſo many words, "What did our Lord do with the law? He abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it." "There is but one duty, which is that of believing." "All commands are unfit for our times." "From any demand of the law no man is obliged now to go one ſtep, to give away one farthing, to eat or omit one morſel." This is indeed carrying matters with a high hand. This is withſtanding our Lord to the face, and telling him, That he underſtood not how to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the meſſage on which he was ſent. O Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge! Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do!</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The moſt ſurpriſing of all the circumſtances, that attend this ſtrong deluſion, is that they who are given up to it really believe, that they honour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by overthrowing his law, and that they are magnifying his office, while they are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his doctrine! Yea, they honour him juſt as <hi>Judas</hi> did, when he <hi>ſaid, Hail, Maſter, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</hi> And he may as juſtly ſay, to every one of them, <hi>Betrayeſt thou the ſon of Man with a kiſs?</hi> It is no other than betraying him with a kiſs, to talk of his blood and take away his crown: to
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:028060_0412_0FD68DBB5BCB6310"/>ſet light by any part of his law, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of advancing his goſpel. Nor indeed can any one eſcape this charge, who preaches faith in any ſuch manner as, either directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, tends to ſet aſide any branch of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: who preaches Chriſt ſo as to diſannull or weaken, in any wiſe, the leaſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God.</p>

It is impoſſible indeed to have too high an eſteem for <hi>the faith of</hi> God's <hi>elect.</hi> And we muſt all declare, <hi>by grace ye are ſaved through faith:—Not of works leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> We muſt cry aloud to every penitent ſinner, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the</hi> Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> But at the ſame time we muſt take care to let all men know, we eſteem no faith but that <hi>which worketh by love:</hi> and that we are not <hi>ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith,</hi> unleſs ſo far as we are delivered from the power as well as the guilt of ſin.

They were only diſtinguiſhed from others, by greater ſtrictneſs of life, by more exactneſs of converſation. For they were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the law in the minuteſt points; paying tithes of mint, aniſe and cummin.

It is as if he had ſaid, I do not ſuffer myſelf to be carried away by that great torrent, cuſtom. I live not by cuſtom, but by reaſon; not by the examples of men, but by the word of God. <hi>I am not an extortioner, not unjuſt, not an adulterer:</hi> however common theſe ſins are, even among thoſe who are called the people of God: (extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in particular, a kind of legal injuſtice; not puniſhable by any human law, the making gain of another's ignorance or neceſſity, having filled every corner of the land) <hi>nor even as this publican;</hi> not guilty of any open or preſumptuous ſin; not an outward ſinner; but a fair, honeſt man, of blameleſs life and converſation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>I faſt twice in the week.</hi> There is more implied in this, than we may at firſt be ſenſible of. All the ſtricter phariſees obſerved the weekly
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028060_0416_0FD68DC565F09DB0"/>faſts; namely, every <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday.</hi> On the former day, they faſted in memory of Moſes receiving on that day (as their tradition taught) the two tables of ſtone written by the finger of God: on the latter, in memory of his caſting them out of his hand, when he ſaw the people dancing round the golden calf. On theſe days, they took no ſuſtenance at all till three in the afternoon; the hour at which they began to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up the evening ſacrifice in the temple. Till that hour it was their cuſtom to remain in the temple, in ſome of the corners, apartments or courts thereof; that they might be ready to aſſiſt at all the ſacrifices, and to join in all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic prayers. The time between, they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to employ, partly in private addreſſes to God, partly in ſearching the ſcriptures, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law and the prophets, and in meditating thereon. Thus much is implied in, <hi>I faſt twice in the week,</hi> the ſecond branch of the righteouſneſs of a phariſee.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs.</hi> This the phariſees did with the utmoſt exactneſs. They would not except the moſt inconſiderable thing, no, not mint, aniſe and cummin. They would not keep back the leaſt part of what they believed properly to belong to God; but gave a full tenth of their whole ſubſtance yearly, and of all their increaſe, whatſoever it was.</p>
                     <p>Yea, the ſtricter phariſees (as has been often obſerved, by thoſe who are verſed in the ancient Jewiſh writings) not content with giving one tenth of their ſubſtance to God, in his prieſts and levites, gave another tenth to God in the poor, and that continually.

                     <p n="6">6. This was <hi>the righteouſneſs of the ſcribes and phariſees:</hi> a righteouſneſs, which in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, went far beyond the conception which many have been accuſtomed to entertain concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.

And theſe are they whom our Lord ſo ſeverely condemns, ſo ſharply reproves on many occaſions. But we muſt not ſuppoſe, becauſe many phariſees were hypocrites, therefore all were ſo. Nor indeed is hypocriſy by any means eſſential to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a phariſee. This is not the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mark of their ſect. It is rather this (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Lord's account) <hi>they truſted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others.</hi> This is their genuine badge. But the phariſee of this kind cannot be a hypocrite. He muſt be, in the common ſenſe, ſincere: otherwiſe he could not <hi>truſt in himſelf that he is righteous.</hi> The man who was here commending himſelf to God, unqueſtionably thought himſelf righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Conſequently, he was no hypocrite: he
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028060_0418_0FD68DCA3371A1C8"/>was not conſcious to himſelf of any inſincerity. He now ſpoke to God juſt what he thought, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     <p>But the example of St. Paul, were there no other, is ſufficient, to put this out of all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He could not only ſay, when he was a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xxiv. 16.</note>

He was no more an hypocrite when he perſecuted the church, than when he preached the faith which once he perſecuted. Let this then be added to <hi>the righteouſneſs of the ſcribes and phariſees,</hi> a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere belief that they are righteous, and in all things <hi>doing</hi> God <hi>ſervice.</hi>

                     <p>But, to come cloſer. Can we uſe his firſt plea with God, which is in ſubſtance, "I do no harm. I live in no outward ſin; I do nothing, for which my own heart condemns me." Do you not? are you ſure of that? do you live in no practiſe, for which your own heart condemns you? if you are not an adulterer, if you are not unchaſte, either in word or deed, are you not unjuſt? the grand meaſure of juſtice, as well as of mercy, is, do unto others as thou wouldſt they ſhould do unto thee. Do you walk by this rule? do you never do unto any what you would not they ſhould do unto you? nay, are you not groſsly unjuſt? are you not an extortioner? do you not make a gain of any one's ignorance or neceſſity? neither in buying nor ſelling? ſuppoſe you are engaged in trade, do you demand, do you receive no more than the real value of what you ſell? do you demand, do you receive no more of the ignorant than of the knowing; of a little child, than of an experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced trader? if you do, why does not your heart condemn you? you are a barefaced extortioner. Do you demand no more than the uſual price of the goods, of any who is in preſſing want? who muſt have, and that without delay the things which you only can furniſh him with? if you do, this alſo is flat extortion.

(So our church clearly and peremptorily enjoins all her members to do: to obſerve all theſe, as well as the vigils and the forty days of lent, as "days of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or abſtinence.") Do you faſt twice in the year? I am afraid, ſome among us cannot plead even this!—Do you neglect no opportunity of attending and partaking of the chriſtian ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? How many are they, who call themſelves chriſtians, and yet are utterly regardleſs of it? Yea, do not eat of that bread, or drink of that cup, for months, perhaps years together? Do you every day, either hear the ſcriptures, or read them and meditate thereon? Do you join in prayer with the great congregation, daily, if you have opportunity?

<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028060_0422_0FD68DD46052EED0"/>to diſpenſe with others of equal importance. Thus they were extremely punctual in keeping the fourth commandment; they would not even <hi>rub an ear of corn</hi> on the ſabbath day: but not at all in keeping the third, making little account of light, or even falſe ſwearing. So that their righteouſneſs was partial: whereas the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a real chriſtian is univerſal. He does not obſerve one, or ſome parts of the law of God, and neglect the reſt; but keeps all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, loves them all, values them above gold or precious ſtones.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It may be indeed, that ſome of the ſcribes and phariſees, endeavoured to keep all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and conſequently were, as touching the righteouſneſs of the law, that is, according to the letter of it, blameleſs. But ſtill the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of a chriſtian exceeds all this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſcribe or phariſee, by fulfilling the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as well as the letter of the law, by inward as well as outward obedience. In this, in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of it, it admits of no compariſon. This is the point which our Lord has ſo largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in the whole tenor of this diſcourſe. Their righteouſneſs was external only; chriſtian right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs is in the inner man. The phariſee <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the outſide of the cup and the platter;</hi> the chriſtian is clean within. The phariſee labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſent God with a good life; the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian with a holy heart. The one ſhook off the leaves, perhaps the fruits of ſin; the other <hi>lays the ax to the root:</hi> as not being content with the outward form of godlineſs, how exact ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, unleſs the life, the ſpirit, the power of God unto ſalvation, be felt in the inmoſt ſoul.</p>

                        <pb n="156" facs="unknown:028060_0423_0FD68DD6719CFD20"/>
Thus, to do no harm, to do good, to attend the ordinances of God (the righteouſneſs of a phariſee) are all external: whereas, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, poverty of ſpirit, mourning, meekneſs, hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, the love of our neighbour, and purity of heart (the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of a chriſtian) are all internal. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven peace-making (or doing good) and ſuffering for righteouſneſs ſake, ſtand intitled to the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings annexed to them, only as they imply theſe inward diſpoſitions, as they ſpring from, exerciſe and confirm them. So that whereas the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the ſcribes and phariſees was external only, it may be ſaid, in ſome ſenſe, that the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs of a chriſtian is internal only: all his actions and ſufferings being as nothing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being eſtimated before God only by the tempers from which they ſpring.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Whoſoever therefore thou art, who bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the holy and venerable name of a chriſtian, ſee, firſt, that thy righteouſneſs fall not ſhort of the righteouſneſs of the ſcribes and phariſees. Be <hi>not</hi> thou <hi>as other men are.</hi> Dare to ſtand alone, to be</p>
                     <p>"Againſt example, ſingularly good!" If thou <hi>follow a multitude</hi> at all, it muſt be, <hi>to do evil.</hi> Let not cuſtom or faſhion be thy guide, but reaſon and religion.

Indeed if thou canſt ſave the ſoul of another, do: but at leaſt, ſave one, thy own. Walk not in the path of death, becauſe it is broad, and many walk therein. Nay, by this very token thou mayeſt know it. Is the way wherein thou now walkeſt, a broad,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028060_0424_0FD68DD754207740"/>well-frequented, faſhionable way? then it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly leads to deſtruction. O be not thou "damned for company:" ceaſe from evil; fly from ſin as from the face of a ſerpent.

                     <p>Secondly, Let not thy righteouſneſs fall ſhort of theirs, with regard to the ordinances of God. If thy labour or bodily ſtrength will not allow of thy faſting <hi>twice in the week,</hi> however, deal faithfully with thy own ſoul, and faſt as often as thy ſtrength will permit. Omit no public, no private opportunity, of pouring out thy ſoul in prayer. Neglect no occaſion of eating that bread and drinking that cup, which is the communion of the body and blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Be diligent in ſearching the ſcriptures; read as thou mayeſt, and meditate therein day and night. Rejoice to embrace every opportunity, of hearing <hi>the word of reconciliation</hi> declared by <hi>the ambaſſadors of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>the ſtewards of the myſteries of</hi> God. In uſing all the means of grace, in a conſtant and careful attendance on every ordinance of God, live up to (at leaſt, till thou canſt go beyond) <hi>the righteouſneſs of the ſcribes and phariſees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Fall not ſhort of a phariſee in doing good. Give alms of all thou doſt poſſeſs. Is any hungry? feed him. Is he athirſt? give him drink. Naked? cover him with a garment. If thou haſt this world's goods, do not limit thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028060_0425_0FD68DD92C56D868"/>to a ſcanty proportion. Be merciful to the uttermoſt of thy power. Why not, even as this phariſee? now <hi>make thyſelf friends,</hi> while the time is, <hi>of the mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that when</hi> thou <hi>faileſt,</hi> when this earthly tabernacle is diſſolved, they <hi>may receive thee into everlaſting habitations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. But reſt not here. Let thy <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the ſcribes and pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.</hi> Be not thou content, to <hi>keep the whole law, and offend in one point.

Thou canſt do all things through Chriſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening thee, though without him thou canſt do nothing.</p>
                     <p>Above all, let thy righteouſneſs exceed theirs in the purity and ſpirituality of it. What is the moſt exact form of religion to thee? the moſt perfect outſide righteouſneſs? go thou higher and deeper than all this.

<pb n="165" facs="unknown:028060_0430_0FD68DE4D80BE628"/>of ſoul, which conſtitute real chriſtianity: the inward tempers contained in that holineſs, <hi>without</hi> which <hi>no man ſhall ſee the</hi> Lord; the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which, when flowing from their proper fountain, from a living faith in God through Chriſt Jeſus, are intrinſically and eſſentially good, and acceptable to God. He proceeds to ſhew in this chapter, how all our actions likewiſe, even thoſe that are indifferent in their own nature, may be made holy and good and acceptable to God, by a pure and holy intention. Whatever is done without this, he largely declares, is of no value before God. Whereas whatever outward works are thus conſecrated to God, they are in his ſight of great price.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The neceſſity of this purity of intention, he ſhews firſt, with regard to thoſe, which are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accounted religious actions, and indeed are ſuch, when performed with a right intention. Some of theſe are commonly termed works of piety; the reſt, works of charity or mercy. Of the latter ſort, he particularly names almigiving; of the former, prayer and faſting. But the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections given for theſe are equally to be applied to every work, whether of charity or mercy.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. 1. And firſt, with regard to works of mercy. <hi>Take heed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that ye do not your alms before men, to be ſeen of them. Otherwiſe ye have no reward of your Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

The feeding the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, the cloathing the naked, the entertaining or aſſiſting the ſtranger, the viſiting thoſe that are ſick or in priſon, the comforting the afflicted; the inſtructing the ignorant, the reproving the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the exhorting and encouraging the well-doer; and if there be any other work of mercy, it is equally included in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> our alms before men, to be ſeen of them.</hi> The thing which is here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, is not, barely the doing good in the ſight of men: this circumſtance alone, that others ſee what we do, makes the action neither worſe nor better: but the doing it before men, <hi>to be ſeen of them;</hi> with this view, from this intention only. I ſay, from <hi>this intention only;</hi> for this may, in ſome caſes, be a part of our intention; we may deſign that ſome of our actions ſhould be ſeen, and yet they may be acceptable to God. We may intend, that our <hi>light</hi> ſhould <hi>ſhine before men,</hi> when our conſcience bears us witneſs, in the Holy Ghoſt, that our ultimate end in deſigning they ſhould <hi>ſee our good works,</hi> is, <hi>that they may glorify our Father which is in heaven.</hi> But take heed that ye do not the leaſt thing with a view to your own glory. Take heed, that a regard to the praiſe of men, have no place at all in your works of mercy. If ye ſeek your own glory, if you have any deſign to gain the honour that cometh of men, whatever is done with this view is nothing worth; it is not done unto the Lord;
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028060_0432_0FD68DEBF111A540"/>he accepteth it not; <hi>ye have no reward</hi> for this <hi>of your Father which is in heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Therefore when thou doſt thine alms, do not ſound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do, in the ſynagogues and in the ſtreets, that they may have praiſe of men.</hi> The word <hi>ſynagogue</hi> does not here mean, a place of worſhip, but any place of public reſort, ſuch as the market-place or exchange. It was a common thing among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were men of large fortunes, particularly among the phariſees, to cauſe a trumpet to be ſounded before them in the moſt public parts of the city, when they were about to give any conſiderable alms. The pretended reaſon for this was, To call the poor together to receive it: but the real deſign, that they might have praiſe of men. But be not thou like unto them. Do not thou cauſe a trumpet to be founded before thee. Uſe no oſtentation in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good. Aim at the honour which cometh of God only. <hi>They</hi> who ſeek the praiſe of men, <hi>have their reward.</hi> They ſhall have no praiſe of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>But when thou doeſt alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</hi> This is a proverbial expreſſion, the meaning of which is, Do it in as ſecret a manner as is poſſible: as ſecret as is conſiſtent with the doing it at all; (for it muſt not be left undone: omit no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing good, whether ſecretly or openly) and with the doing it in the moſt effectual manner. For here is alſo an exception to be made. When you are fully perſuaded in your own mind, that by your not concealing the good which is done,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028060_0433_0FD68DED131B2CA0"/>either you will yourſelf be enabled, or others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to do the more good, then you may not conceal it: then let your light appear, and <hi>ſhine to all that are in the houſe.</hi> But unleſs where the glory of God and the good of mankind oblige you to the contrary, act in as private and unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a manner, as the nature of the thing will admit: <hi>That thy alms may be in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, he ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> Perhaps in the preſent world; many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this ſtand recorded in all ages: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly in the world to come, before the general aſſembly of men and angels.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. 1. From works of charity or mercy, our Lord proceeds to thoſe which are termed works of piety. <hi>And when thou prayeſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou ſhalt not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to pray ſtanding in the ſynagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, that they may be ſeen of men. Thou ſhalt not be as the hypocrites are.</hi> Hypocriſy then, or inſincerity, is the firſt thing we are to guard againſt in prayer. Beware not to ſpeak what thou doſt not mean. Prayer is, the lifting up of the heart to God: all words of prayer without this are mere hypocriſy. Whenever therefore thou at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteſt to pray, ſee that it be thy one deſign, to commune with God, to lift up thy heart to him, to pour out thy ſoul before him. Not <hi>as the hypocrites,</hi> who <hi>love,</hi> or are wont, <hi>to pray ſtanding in the ſynagogues,</hi> the exchange or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-places, <hi>and in the corners of the ſtreets,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the moſt people are, <hi>that they may be ſeen of men:</hi> this was the ſole deſign, the motive and end, of the prayers which they there repeated.
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:028060_0434_0FD68DEE997BA2C8"/>
                        <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, they have their reward.</hi> They are to expect none from your Father which is in heaven.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But it is not only, the having an eye to the praiſe of men, which cuts us off from any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven; which leaves us no room to expect the bleſſing of God, upon our works whether of piety or mercy. Purity of intention is equally deſtroyed by a view to any temporal reward whatever. If we repeat our prayers, if we attend the public worſhip of God, if we relieve the poor, with a view to gain or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, it is not a whit more acceptable to God, than if it were done with a view to praiſe. Any temporal view, any motive whatever on this ſide eternity, any deſign but that of promoting the glory of God, and the happineſs of men, for God's ſake, makes every action, however fair it may appear to men, an abomination unto the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>But when thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut the door, pray to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in ſecret.</hi> There is a time, when thou art openly to glorify God, to pray and praiſe him in the great congregation. But when thou deſireſt more largely and more particularly to make thy requeſts known unto God, whether it be in the evening or in the morning or at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>enter into thy cloſet and ſhut the door.</hi> Uſe all the privacy thou canſt. (Only leave it not undone, whether thou haſt any cloſet, any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy or no. Pray to God if it be poſſible, when none ſeeth but he: but if otherwiſe, pray to God.) Thus <hi>pray to thy Father which is in ſecret;</hi> pour out all thy heart before him. <hi>And thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:028060_0435_0FD68DF01C8D5768"/>which ſeeth in ſecret, he ſhall reward thee openly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>But when ye pray,</hi> even in ſecret, <hi>uſe not vain repetitions, as the heathen do.</hi> M <gap reason="foreign">

Say not the ſame thing over and over again; think not the fruit of your prayers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the length of them: like the heathens; for <hi>they think they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The thing here reproved, is not ſimply the length, no more than the ſhortneſs of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: but, firſt, length without meaning; the ſpeaking much, and meaning little or nothing: the uſing (not all repetitions; for our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf prayed thrice, repeating the ſame words; but) vain repetitions, as the heathens did, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the names of their gods over and over: as they do among chriſtians (vulgarly ſo called) and not among the papiſts only, who ſay over and over the ſame ſtring of prayers, without ever feeling what they ſpeak: Secondly, the thinking to be heard for our much ſpeaking, the fancying God meaſures prayers by their length, and is beſt pleaſed with thoſe which contain the moſt words, which ſound the longeſt in his ears. Theſe are ſuch inſtances of ſuperſtition and ſolly, as all who are named by the name of Chriſt, ſhould leave to the heathens, to them on whom the glorious light of the goſpel hath never ſhined.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Be not ye therefore like unto them.</hi> Ye who have taſted of the grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus, are throughly convinced, <hi>your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye aſk him.</hi> So that the

                     <p n="3">III. 1. After having taught the true nature and ends of prayer, our Lord ſubjoins an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it: even that divine form of prayer, which ſeems in this place to be pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We may obſerve in general concerning this divine prayer. Firſt, That it contains all we can reaſonably or innocently pray for. There is nothing which we can aſk without offending him, which is not included either directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly in this comprehenſive form: Secondly, That it contains all we can reaſonably or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently deſire; whatever is for the glory of God, whatever is needful or proſitable not only for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for every creature in heaven and earth. And indeed our prayers are the proper teſt of our deſires; nothing being ſit to have a place in our deſires, which is not ſit to have a
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028060_0437_0FD68DF616017FC8"/>place in our prayers; what we may not pray for, neither ſhould we deſire: Thirdly, That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all our duty to God and man; whatſoever things are pure and holy, whatſoever God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of the children of men, whatſoever is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in his ſight, whatſoever it is whereby we may profit our neighbour, being expreſſed or implied therein.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It conſiſts of three parts, the preface, the petitions, and the doxology or concluſion. The preface, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven,</hi> lays a general foundation for prayer; compriſing what we muſt firſt know of God, before we can pray, in confidence of being heard. It likewiſe points out to us all thoſe tempers, with which we are to approach to God, which are moſt eſſentially requiſite, if we deſire either our prayers or our lives ſhould find acceptance with him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>"Our Father."</hi> If he is a Father, then he is good, then he is loving to his children. And here is the firſt and great reaſon for prayer. God is willing to bleſs, let us aſk for a bleſſing. <hi>"Our Father,"</hi>—Our Creator; the Author of our being; he who raiſed us from the duſt of the earth, who breathed into us the breath of life, and we became living ſouls. But if he made us, let us aſk and he will not with-hold any good thing from the work of his own hands. <hi>"Our Father"</hi>—Our preſerver; who day by day ſuſtains the life he has given: of whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing love, we now and every moment receive life and breath and all things.

                     <p>For this alſo we pray in thoſe words, <hi>Thy kingdom come:</hi> we pray for the coming of his everlaſting kingdom, the kingdom of glory in heaven, which is the continuation and perfection of the kingdom of grace on earth. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this, as well as the preceding petition, is offered up for the whole intelligent creation, who are all intereſted in this grand event, the ſinal renovation of all things, by God's putting an end to miſery and ſin, to infirmity and death, for the righteous; taking all things into his own hands, and ſetting up the kingdom which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth throughout all ages.</p>
                     <p>Exactly anſwerable to this, are thoſe awful words, in the prayer, at the burial of the dead; "Beſeeching thee, that it may pleaſe thee of thy gracious goodneſs, ſhortly to accompliſh the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thine elect, and to haſten thy kingdom: that we with all thoſe that are departed, in the true faith of thy holy name, may have our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conſummation and bliſs, both in body and ſoul, in thy everlaſting glory."</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</hi> This is the neceſſary and immediate conſequence, wherever the kingdom of God is come: where
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028060_0443_0FD68E016286FD40"/>ever God dwells in the ſoul by faith, and Chriſt reigns in the heart by love.</p>
                     <p>It is probable, many, perhaps the generality of men, at the firſt view of theſe words, are apt to imagine they are only an expreſſion of, or petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for reſignation; for a readineſs to ſuffer the will of God, whatſoever it be concerning us. And this is unqueſtionably a divine and excellent temper, a moſt precious gift of God. But this is not what we pray for in this petition, at leaſt not in the chief and primary ſenſe of it. We pray, not ſo much for a paſſive, as for an active conformity to the will of God, in ſaying, <hi>Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How is it done by the angels of God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? thoſe who now circle his throne rejoicing? they do it <hi>willingly;</hi> they love his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and gladly hearken to his words. It is their meat and drink to do his will; it is their higheſt glory and joy. They do it <hi>continually;</hi> there is no interruption in their willing ſervice. They reſt not day nor night, but employ every hour (ſpeaking after the manner of men; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our meaſures of duration, days and nights and hours, have no place in eternity) in fulfilling his commands, in executing his deſigns, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the counſel of his will. And they do it <hi>perfectly.</hi> No ſin, no defect belongs to angelic minds. It is true; <hi>the ſtars are not pure in his ſight,</hi> even the morning-ſtars that ſing together before him. <hi>In his ſight,</hi> that is in compariſon of him, the very angels are not pure. But this does not imply, that they are not pure <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Doubtleſs they are; they are without
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028060_0444_0FD68E052C03E9F0"/>ſpot and blameleſs. They are altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his will, and perfectly obedient in all things.</p>
                     <p>If we view this in another light, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the angels of God in heaven, do <hi>all</hi> the will of God. And they do nothing elſe, nothing but what they are abſolutely aſſured is his will Again, they do all the will of God, <hi>as</hi> he will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in the manner which pleaſes him, and no other. Yea, and they do this, only <hi>becauſe</hi> it is his will; for this and no other reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. When therefore we pray, that the <hi>will of</hi> God may <hi>be done on earth as it is in heaven,</hi> the meaning is, that all the inhabitants of the earth, even the whole race of mankind, may do the will of their Father which is in heaven, as <hi>willingly</hi> as the holy angels: that theſe may do it <hi>continually</hi> even as they, without any interruption of their willing ſervice: yea, and that they may do it <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly;</hi> that <hi>the</hi> God <hi>of peace, through the blood of the everlaſting covenant, may make them perfect in every good work to do his will, and work in them all which is well-pleaſing in his ſight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In other words, we pray, that we and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, may do the whole will of God in all things: and nothing elſe, not the leaſt thing but what is the holy and acceptable will of God. We pray that we may do the whole will of God <hi>as</hi> he willeth, in the manner that pleaſes him: and laſtly, that we may do it, <hi>becauſe</hi> it is his will: that this may be the ſole reaſon and ground, the whole and only motive of whatſoever we think, or whatſoever we ſpeak or do.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Our daily bread.</hi> The word we render <hi>daily</hi> has been differently explained by different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators. But the moſt plain and natural ſenſe of it ſeems to be this, which is retained in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all tranſlations, as well ancient as modern: what is ſufficient for this day; and ſo for each day, as it ſucceeds.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Give us.</hi> For we claim nothing of right, but only of free mercy. We deſerve not the air we breathe, the earth that bears, or the ſun
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028060_0446_0FD68E08117C70C0"/>that ſhines upon us. All our deſert, we own, is hell But God loves us freely. Therefore we aſk him to <hi>give,</hi> what we can no more <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> for ourſelves, than we can <hi>merit</hi> it at his hands.</p>
                     <p>Not that either the goodneſs or the power of God is a reaſon for us to ſtand idle. It is his will, that we ſhould uſe all diligence in all things, that we ſhould employ our utmoſt endeavours, as much as if our ſucceſs were the natural effect of our own wiſdom and ſtrength. And then, as though we had done nothing, we are to depend on him, the giver of every good and perfect gift.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This day.</hi> For we are to take no thought for the morrow. For this very end has our wiſe Creator divided life into theſe little por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of time, ſo clearly ſeparated from each other: that we might look on every day, as a freſh gift of God, another life, which we may devote to his glory; and that every evening may be as the cloſe of life, beyond which we are to ſee nothing but eternity.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>And forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> As nothing but ſin can hinder the bounty of God from flowing forth upon every creature, ſo this petition na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follows the former; that all hinderances being removed, we may the more clearly truſt in the God of love, for every manner of thing which is good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Our treſpaſſes.</hi> The word properly ſignifies <hi>our debts.</hi> Thus our ſins are frequently repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in ſcripture: every ſin laying us under a freſh debt to God; to whom we already owe,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028060_0447_0FD68E0B1009DD90"/>as it were, ten thouſand talents. What then can we anſwer when he ſhall ſay, <hi>Pay me that thou oweſt?</hi> We are utterly inſolvent: we have nothing to pay: we have waſted all our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Therefore if he deal with us according to the rigour of his law, if he exact what he juſtly may, he muſt command us to be <hi>bound hand and foot, and delivered over to the tormentors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed we are already bound hand and foot, by the chains of our own ſins. Theſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with regard to ourſelves, are chains of iron and fetters of braſs. They are wounds wherewith the world, the fleſh and the devil, have gaſhed and mangled us all over. They are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that drink up our blood and ſpirits, that bring us down to the chambers of the grave. But conſidered as they are here, with regard to God, they are debts immenſe and numberleſs. Well therefore, ſeeing we have nothing to pay, may we cry unto him, that he would <hi>frankly forgive</hi> us all.</p>
                     <p>The word tranſlated <hi>forgive,</hi> implies either to forgive a debt, or to unlooſe a chain. And if we attain the former, the latter follows of courſe; if our debts are forgiven, the chains fall off our hands. As ſoon as ever, through the free grace of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we <hi>receive forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> we receive likewiſe <hi>a lot among thoſe which are ſanctified, by faith which is in</hi> him. Sin has loſt its power: it has no dominion over thoſe, who <hi>are under grace,</hi> that is, in favour with God. As <hi>there is now no condemnation for them that are in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, ſo they are freed from ſin as well as from guilt. <hi>The righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028060_0448_0FD68E111F9501B8"/>in them,</hi> and they <hi>walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>As we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi> In theſe words our Lord clearly declares, both on what condition, and in what degree or manner we may look to be forgiven of God. All our treſpaſſes and ſins are forgiven us, <hi>if</hi> we forgive, and <hi>as</hi> we forgive others. This is a point of the utmoſt importance. And our bleſſed Lord is ſo jealous, leſt at any time we ſhould let it ſlip out of our thoughts, that he not only inſerts it in the body of his prayer, but preſently after repeats it twice over.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 14, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi> Secondly, God forgives us, <hi>as</hi> we forgive others. So that if any malice or bitterneſs, if any taint of unkindneſs or anger remains, if we do not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fully, and from the heart, forgive all men their treſpaſſes, we ſo far cut ſhort the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own. God cannot clearly and fully forgive us. He may ſhew us ſome degree of mercy. But we will not ſuffer him to blot out all our ſins, and forgive all our iniquities.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, while we do not from our hearts, forgive our neighbour his treſpaſſes, what manner of prayer are we offering to God, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we utter theſe words? we are indeed ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God at open defiance: we are daring him to do his worſt. Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028060_0449_0FD68E129E4D9950"/>forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us! that is in plain terms, "Do not thou forgive us at all: we deſire no favour at thy hands. We pray, that thou wilt keep our ſins in remembrance, and that thy wrath may abide upon us." But can you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly offer ſuch a prayer to God? and hath he not yet caſt you quick into hell? O tempt him no longer! now, even now, by his grace, forgive as you would be forgiven! now have compaſſion on thy fellow-ſervant, as God hath had and will have pity on thee.</p>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p n="1">1. IT has been the endeavour of Satan from the beginning of the world, to put aſunder what God had joined together; to ſeparate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from outward religion, to ſet one of theſe at variance with the other. And herein he has met with no ſmall ſucceſs, among thoſe who were <hi>ignorant of his devices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many in all ages, having a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, have been ſtrictly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the <hi>righteouſneſs of the law,</hi> the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of outward duties, but in the mean time wholly regardleſs of inward righteouſneſs, <hi>the righteouſneſs which is of</hi> God <hi>by faith.</hi> And many
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028060_0457_0FD68E272F0AF418"/>have run into the oppoſite extreme, diſregarding all outward duties, perhaps even <hi>ſpeaking evil of the law and judging the law,</hi> ſo far as it enjoins the performance of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is by this very device of Satan, that faith and works have been ſo often ſet at variance with each other. And many who had a real zeal for God, have for a time fallen into the ſnare on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand. Some have magnified faith to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter excluſion of good works, not only from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of our juſtification (for we know that man is <hi>juſtified freely by the redemption which is in</hi> Jeſus) but from being the neceſſary fruit of it, yea, from having any place in the religion of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Others, eager to avoid this dangerous miſtake, have run as much too far the contrary way; and either maintained, That good works were the cauſe, at leaſt the previous condition of juſtification; or ſpoken of them as if they were all in all, the whole religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the ſame manner have the end and the means of religion, been ſet at variance with each other. Some well-meaning men, have ſeemed to place all religion, in attending the prayers of the church, in receiving the Lord's ſupper, in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſermons, and reading books of piety: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting mean-time the end of all theſe, the love of God and their neighbour. And this very thing has confirmed others in the neglect, if not contempt of the ordinances of God; ſo wretchedly abuſed to undermine and overthrow the very end they were deſigned to eſtabliſh.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But of all the means of grace there is ſcarce any, concerning which men have run
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028060_0458_0FD68E295EC624B0"/>into greater extremes, than that of which our Lord ſpeaks in the above-mentioned words, I mean, religious faſting. How have ſome exalted this beyond all ſcripture and reaſon? and others utterly diſregarded it? as it were, revenging themſelves, by undervaluing, as much as the former had overvalued it. Thoſe have ſpoken of it, as if it were all in all; if not the end itſelf, yet infallibly connected with it: theſe, as if it were juſt nothing, as if it were a fruitleſs labour, which had no relation at all thereto. Whereas it is certain the truth lies between them both. It is not all; nor yet is it nothing. It is not the end, but it is a precious means thereto; a means which God himſelf has ordained; and in which therefore, when it is duly uſed, he will ſurely give us his bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>In order to ſet this in the cleareſt light, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, Firſt, what is the nature of faſting, and what the ſeveral ſorts and degrees thereof: Secondly, what are the reaſons, grounds and ends of it: Thirdly, how we may anſwer the moſt plauſible objections againſt it: and Fourthly, in what manner it ſhould be performed.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. 1. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, Firſt, what is the nature of faſting, and what the ſeveral ſorts and degrees thereof. As to the nature of it, all the inſpired writers, both in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the New, take the word, to faſt, in one ſingle ſenſe, for not to eat, to abſtain from food. This is ſo clear, that it would be labour loſt to quote the words of <hi>David, Nehemiah, Iſaiah,</hi> and the prophets which followed, or of
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028060_0459_0FD68E2A99AC5B70"/>our Lord and his apoſtles; all agreeing in this, that, to faſt, is not to eat for a time preſcribed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To this other circumſtances were uſually joined by them of old, which had no neceſſary connexion with it. Such were the neglect of their apparel, the laying aſide thoſe ornaments which they were accuſtomed to wear: the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on mourning, the ſtrewing aſhes upon their head, or wearing ſackcloth next their ſkin. But we find little mention made in the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of any of theſe indifferent circumſtances. Nor does it appear that any ſtreſs was laid upon them, by the chriſtians of the purer ages; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome penitents might voluntarily uſe them, as outward ſigns of inward humiliation. Much leſs did the apoſtles or the chriſtians cotemporary with them, beat or tear their own fleſh. Such <hi>diſcipline</hi> as this was not unbecoming the prieſts or worſhippers of <hi>Baal.</hi> The gods of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were but devils; and it was doubtleſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to their devil-god, when his prieſts<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings xviii. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>cried aloud, and cut themſelves after this manner, till the blood guſhed out upon them:</hi> but it cannot be pleaſing to Him, nor become his followers, who <hi>came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. As to the degrees or meaſures of faſting, we have inſtances of ſome who have faſted ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days together. So Moſes, Elijah and our bleſſed Lord, being indued with ſupernatural ſtrength for that purpoſe, are recorded to have faſted without intermiſſion, <hi>forty days and forty nights.</hi> But the time of faſting more frequently mentioned in ſcripture, is, one day, from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028060_0460_0FD68E2C153ED7C0"/>till evening. And this was the faſt commonly obſerved among the ancient chriſtians. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide theſe, they had alſo their half-faſts (<hi>ſemije<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junia,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſtiles them) on the fourth and ſixth days of the week (Wedneſday and Friday) throughout the year: on which they took no ſuſtenance till three in the afternoon, the time when they returned from the public ſervice.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Nearly related to this, is what our church ſeems peculiarly to mean by the term <hi>abſtinence:</hi> which may be uſed when we cannot faſt entirely by reaſon of ſickneſs or hodily weakneſs. This is, the eating little; the abſtaining in part; the taking a ſmaller quantity of food than uſual. I do not remember any ſcriptural inſtance of this. But neither can I condemn it. For the ſcripture does not: it may have its uſe, and receive a bleſſing from God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The loweſt kind of faſting, if it can be called by that name, is the abſtaining from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant food. Of this we have ſeveral inſtances in ſcripture beſides that of Daniel and his brethren: who from a peculiar conſideration, namely, that they might<note n="*" place="bottom">Dan, iv. 5, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>not defile themſelves with the portion of the kings meat,</hi> nor <hi>with the wine which he drank</hi> (<hi>a daily proviſion</hi> of which <hi>the king had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them</hi>) <hi>requeſted</hi> and obtained of <hi>the prince of the eunuchs, pulſe to eat and water to drink.</hi> Perhaps from a miſtaken imitation of this, might ſpring the very ancient cuſtom, of abſtaining from fleſh and wine during ſuch times as were ſet a-part for faſting and abſtinence. If it did not rather ariſe from a ſuppoſition that

                     <p>And in like manner, particular perſons, who take heed unto their ways, and deſire to walk humbly and cloſely with God, will find frequent occaſion for private ſeaſons of thus afflicting their ſouls, before their Father which is in ſecret.

                     <p n="2">II. 1. I proceed, to ſhew, in the ſecond place, what are the grounds, the reaſons and ends of faſting.</p>
                     <p>And, firſt, men who are under ſtrong emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mind, who are affected with any vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſion, ſuch as ſorrow or fear, are often ſwallowed up therein, and even <hi>forget to eat their bread.</hi> At ſuch ſeaſons they have little regard for food, not even what is needful to ſuſtain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; much leſs for any delicacy or variety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And thus <hi>David and all the men that were with him,</hi> when they heard that <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were fled from the battle, and that many of the people were fallen and dead, and</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> Jonathan <hi>his ſon were dead alſo;</hi>

                        <hi>mourned and wept and faſted until even for</hi> Saul <hi>and</hi> Jonathan, <hi>and for the houſe of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
                     <p>Nay, many times they whoſe minds are deeply engaged, and impatient of any interruption, and even loath their needful food, as diverting their thoughts, from what they deſire ſhould engroſs their whole attention. Even as Saul, when on the occaſion mentioned before, he had <hi>fallen all along upon the earth and there was no ſtrength in him,</hi> yet <hi>ſaid, I will not eat,</hi> till <hi>his ſervants, together with the woman compelled him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Here then is the natural ground of faſting. One who is under deep affliction, overwhelmed with ſorrow for ſin, and a ſtrong apprehenſion of the wrath of God, would without any rule, without knowing or conſidering, whether it were a command of God or not, <hi>forget to eat his bread,</hi> abſtain not only from pleaſant, but even from needful food. Like St. Paul, who after he was

                        <hi>led into</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>was three days without ſight, and neither did eat nor drink,</hi> Acts ix. 9.</p>
                     <p>Yea, when the ſtorm roſe high, when <hi>an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible dread overwhelmed</hi> one who had long been without God in the world; his ſoul would <hi>loath all manner of meat;</hi> it would be unpleaſing and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to him.

                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>How ſtrongly is this expreſſed by our church, in the firſt part of the homily on faſting?</p>
                     <p>"When men feel in themſelves the heavy burthen of ſin, ſee damnation to be the reward of it, and behold with the eye of their mind the horror of hell; they tremble, they quake, and are inwardly touched with ſorrowfulneſs of heart, and cannot but accuſe themſelves and open their grief unto almighty God, and call unto him for mercy. This being done ſeriouſly, their mind is ſo occupied (taken up) partly with ſorrow and heavineſs, partly with an earneſt deſire to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from this danger of hell and damnation, that all deſire of meat and drink is laid apart, and loathſomeneſs (or loathing) of all worldly things and pleaſure cometh in place. So that nothing then liketh them more than to weep, to lament, to mourn, and both with words and behaviour of body to ſhow themſelves weary of life."</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another reaſon or ground of faſting is this. Many of thoſe who now fear God, are deeply ſenſible how often they have ſinned againſt him, by the abuſe of theſe lawful things. They know, how much they have ſinned by exceſs of food; how long they have tranſgreſſed the holy law of
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:028060_0465_0FD62897E03671D8"/>God, with regard to temperance, if not ſobriety too: how they have indulged their ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, perhaps to the impairing even their bodily health; certainly to the no ſmall hurt of their ſoul. For hereby they continually fed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed that ſprightly folly, that airineſs of mind, that levity of temper, that gay inattention to things of the deepeſt concern, that giddineſs and careleſſneſs of ſpirit, which were no other than drunkenneſs of ſoul, which ſtupified all their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt faculties, no leſs than exceſs of wine or ſtrong drink. To remove therefore the effect, they remove the cauſe: They keep at a diſtance from all exceſs. They abſtain, as far as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from what had well nigh plunged them in everlaſting perdition. They often wholly refrain; always take care to be ſparing and temperate in all things.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They likewiſe well remember, how fulneſs of bread, increaſed not only careleſſeſs and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſpirit, but alſo fooliſh and unholy deſires, yea, unclean and vile affections. And this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience puts beyond all doubt. Even a genteel; regular ſenſuality, is continually ſenſualizing the ſoul, and ſinking it into a level with the beaſts that periſh. It cannot be expreſſed what an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect variety and delicacy of food have on the mind as well as the body; making it juſt ripe for every pleaſure of ſenſe, as ſoon as opportunity ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite. Therefore on this ground alſo e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>y wiſe man will refrain his foul, and keep it low; will wean it more and more from all thoſe indulgences of the inferior appetites, which naturally tend to chain it down to earth, and to pollute as well as debaſe it. Here is another perpetual reaſon for
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028060_0466_0FD68E35D5CE2358"/>faſting: to remove the food of luſt and ſenſuality, to withdraw the incentives of fooliſh and hurtful deſires, of vile and vain affections.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Perhaps we need not altogether omit (altho' I know not if we ſhould do well, to lay any great ſtreſs upon it) another reaſon for faſting, which ſome good men have largely inſiſted on: namely, the puniſhing themſelves for having abuſed the good gifts of God, by ſometimes wholly refraining from them: thus exerciſing a kind of holy revenge upon themſelves, for their paſt folly and ingratitude, in turning the things which ſhould have been for their health, into an occaſion of falling. They ſuppoſe <hi>David</hi> to have had an eye to this when he ſaid, <hi>I wept and chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,</hi> or puniſhed <hi>my ſoul with faſting:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he mentions <hi>what revenge</hi> godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row occaſioned in the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. A fifth, and more weighty reaſon for faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is, That it is an help to prayer: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, when we ſet apart larger portions of time for private prayer. Then eſpecially it is, that God is often pleaſed to lift up the ſouls of his ſervants above all the things of earth, and ſometimes to wrap them up, as it were, into the third heavens. And it is chiefly, as it is an help to prayer, that it has ſo frequently been found a means in the hand of God, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and increaſing not one virtue, not chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity only (as ſome have idly imagined, without any ground, either from ſcripture, reaſon or experience) but alſo ſeriouſneſs of ſpirit, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, ſenſibility, and tenderneſs of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; deadneſs to the world, and conſequently
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:028060_0467_0FD68E36F9294530"/>the love of God and every holy and heavenly affection.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Not that there is any natural or neceſſary connexion, between faſting, and the bleſſings God conveys thereby. But he will have mercy <hi>as</hi> he will have mercy: he will convey whatſoever ſeemeth him good, by whatſoever means he is pleaſed to appoint. And he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ing his wrath, and obtaining whatever bleſſings we from time to time ſtand in need of.</p>
                     <p>How powerful a means this is, to avert the wrath of God, we may learn from the remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtance of <hi>Ahab. There was none like</hi> him, <hi>who did ſell himſelf;</hi> wholly give himſelf up, like a ſlave bought with money, <hi>to work wickedneſs.</hi> Yet whenever he <hi>rent his cloaths and put ſackcloth upon his fleſh, and faſted, and went ſoftly: The word of the</hi> Lord <hi>came to</hi> Elijah, <hi>ſaying, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>It was for this end, to avert the wrath of God, that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſought God, <hi>with faſting and ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> This appears from the whole tenor of his prayer, particularly from the ſolemn concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. <hi>O</hi> Lord, <hi>according to all thy righteouſneſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> (or mercies) <hi>let thy anger be turned away from thy holy mountain—Hear the prayer of thy ſervant, and cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy ſanctuary that is deſolate.—O</hi> Lord, <hi>hear! O</hi> Lord, <hi>forgive: O</hi> Lord, <hi>hearken and do, for thine own ſake,</hi> Dan. ix. 3, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. But it is not only from the people of God that we learn, when his anger is moved, to ſeek
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028060_0468_0FD68E3817AADE50"/>him by faſting and prayer; but even from the heathens. When Jonah had declared, <hi>yet forty days and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed, the people of</hi> Nineveh <hi>proclaimed a faſt, and put on ſackcloth From the greateſt of them unto the leaſt.

                     <p n="10">10. In like manner, the apoſtles always joined faſting with prayer, when they deſired the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God on any important undertaking. Thus we read, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. <hi>There were in the church that was at</hi> Antioch <hi>certain prophets and teachers—As they miniſtered to the</hi> Lord <hi>and faſted</hi> (doubtleſs for direction in this very affair) <hi>the Holy Ghoſt ſaid, ſeparate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had</hi> (a ſecond time) <hi>faſted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they ſent them away,</hi> ver. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>Thus alſo Paul and Barnabas themſelves, as we read in the following chapter, when they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to</hi> Lyſtra, Iconium <hi>and</hi> Antioch, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the ſouls of the diſciples;</hi> and <hi>when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had

                     <p>Yea, that bleſſings are to be obtained in the uſe of this means, which are no otherwiſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, our Lord expreſsly declares in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his diſciples, aſking,<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xvii. 19, &amp;c.</note>

                     <p n="11">11. Theſe were the appointed means. For it was not merely by the light of reaſon, or of natural conſcience (as it is called) that the people of God have been in all ages directed, to uſe faſting as a means to theſe ends. But they have been from time to time taught it of God himſelf, by clear and open revelations of his will.

But above all theſe we have a peculiar reaſon for being in faſtings often, namely, the command of him by whoſe name we are called. He does not indeed in this place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly enjoin, either faſting, giving of alms or prayer. But his directions how to faſt, to give alms, and to pray, are of the ſame force with ſuch injunctions. For the commanding us, to do any thing <hi>that,</hi> is an unqueſtionable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to do that thing; ſeeing it is impoſſible to perform it thus, if it be not performed at all. Conſequently, the ſaying, give alms, pray, faſt in ſuch a manner, is a clear command to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028060_0472_0FD68E3FB14F7190"/>all thoſe duties: as well as to perform them in that manner, which ſhall in no wiſe loſe its reward.</p>
                     <p>And this is a ſtill farther motive and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, to the performance of this duty; even the promiſe which our Lord has graciouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the due diſcharge of it: <hi>Thy Father, which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> Such are the plain grounds, reaſons and ends of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſuch our encouragement to perſevere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, notwithſtanding abundance of objections which men, wiſer than their Lord, have been continually raiſing againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. 1. The moſt plauſible of theſe I come now to conſider. And, Firſt, It has been frequently ſaid, "Let a chriſtian faſt from ſin, and not from food: this is what God requires at his hands." So he does: but he requires the other alſo. Therefore this ought to be done, and that not left undone.</p>
                     <p>View your argument in its full dimenſions; and your will eaſily judge of the ſtrength of it.</p>
                     <p>"If a chriſtian ought to abſtain from ſin, then he ought not to abſtain from food:</p>
                     <p>But a chriſtian ought to abſtain from ſin:</p>
                     <p>Therefore he ought not to abſtain from food."</p>
                     <p>That a chriſtian ought to abſtain from ſin, is moſt true. But does it follow from hence, that he ought not to abſtain from food? Yea, let him do both the one and the other. Let him, by the grace of God, always abſtain from ſin; and let him often abſtain from food; for ſuch reaſons and
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028060_0473_0FD68E41148426C8"/>ends as experience and ſcripture plainly ſhew to be anſwered thereby.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. "But is it not better (as it has, Secondly, been objected) to abſtain from pride and vanity, from fooliſh and hurtful deſires, from peeviſhneſs, and anger, and diſcontent, than from food?" Without queſtion it is. But here again we have need to remind you of our Lord's words, <hi>theſe things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi> And indeed the latter is only in order to the former; it is a means to that great end. We abſtain from food with this view, that by the grace of God, conveyed into our ſouls, through this outward means, in conjunction with all the other channels of his grace which he hath appointed, we may be enabled to abſtain from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſion and temper, which is not pleaſing in his ſight. We refrain from the one, that being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with power from on high, we may be able to refrain from the other, ſo that your argument proves juſt the contrary to what you deſigned. It proves, that we ought to faſt. For if we ought to abſtain from evil tempers and deſires, then we ought thus to abſtain from food: ſince theſe little inſtances of ſelf-denial are the ways God hath choſe, wherein to beſtow that great ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. "But we do not find it ſo in fact: (this is a third objection.) We have faſted much and often. But what did it avail? we were not a whit better: we found no bleſſing therein. Nay, we have found it an hinderance rather than an help. Inſtead of preventing anger, for inſtance,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028060_0474_0FD68E429ECAEF40"/>or fretfulneſs, it has been a means of increaſing them to ſuch a height, that we could neither bear others nor ourſelves." This may very poſſibly be the caſe. It is poſſible, either to faſt or pray, in ſuch a manner, as to make you much worſe than before; more unhappy, and more unholy. Yet the fault does not lie in the means itſelf; but in the manner of uſing it. Uſe it ſtill, but uſe it in a different manner. Do what God commands as he commands it, and then doubtleſs his promiſe ſhall not fail; his bleſſing ſhall be with-held no longer: but <hi>when thou faſteſt in ſecret, he that ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. "But is it not mere ſuperſtition (ſo it has been, Fourthly, objected) to imagine that God regards ſuch little things as theſe?" if you ſay it is, you condemn all the generation of God's children. But will you ſay, theſe were all weak, ſuperſtitious men? can you be ſo hardy as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, both of Moſes and Joſhua, of Samuel and David, of Jehoſhaphat, Ezra, Nehemiah, and all the prophets? Yea, of a greater than all, the Son of God himſelf? it is certain, both our Maſter, and all theſe his ſervants, did imagine, that faſting is not a little thing, and that he who is higher than the higheſt doth regard it. Of the ſame judgment, it is plain, were all the apoſtles, after they were <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt and with wiſdom.</hi> When they had <hi>the unction of the Holy One, teaching</hi> them <hi>all things,</hi> they ſtill <hi>approved themſelves the miniſters of</hi> God, <hi>by faſtings,</hi> as well as <hi>by the armour of righteouſneſs on the right hand, and on the left.</hi> After <hi>the Bridegroom was
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028060_0475_0FD68E441444F700"/>taken from them, then did they faſt in thoſe days.</hi> Nor would they attempt any thing (as we have ſeen above) wherein the glory of God was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned, ſuch as the ſending forth labourers into the harveſt, without ſolemn faſting as well as prayer.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. "But if faſting be indeed of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and attended with ſuch a bleſſing, is it not beſt, ſay ſome, Fifthly, to faſt always? not to do it now and then, but to keep a continual faſt? to uſe as much abſtinence at all times, as our bodily ſtrength will bear?" let none be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from doing this. By all means uſe as little and plain food, exerciſe as much ſelf-denial herein at all times, as your bodily ſtrength will bear. And this may conduce, by the bleſſing of God, to ſeveral of the great ends above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. It may be a conſiderable help not only to chaſtity, but alſo to heavenly-mindedneſs; to the weaning your affections from things below, and ſetting them on things above. But this is not faſting, ſcriptural faſting: it is never termed ſo in all the Bible. It in ſome meaſure anſwers ſome of the ends hereof but ſtill it is another thing. Practiſe it by all means; but not ſo as thereby to ſet aſide a command of God, and an inſtituted means of averting his judgment, and obtaining the bleſſings of his children.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Uſe continually then as much abſtinence as you pleaſe; which taken thus, is no other than chriſtian temperance. But this need not at all interfere with your obſerving ſolemn times of faſting and prayer. For inſtance; your habitual
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028060_0476_0FD68E4832DB2658"/>abſtinence or temperance, would not prevent your faſting in ſecret, if you was ſuddenly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with huge ſorrow and remorſe, and with horrible fear and diſmay. Such a ſituation of mind would almoſt conſtrain you to faſt: you would loath your dainty food: you would ſcarce endure even to take ſuch ſupplies, as were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the body, till God lifted-you up-<hi>out of the horrible pit, and ſet your feet upon a rock, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered your goings.</hi> The ſame would be the caſe if you was in agony of deſire vehemently wreſtling with God for his bleſſing. You would need none to inſtruct you, not to eat bread, till you had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the requeſt of your lips.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Again had you been at Nineveh, when it was proclaimed throughout the city, <hi>Let neither man nor beaſt, herd nor flock taſte any thing: let them not feed or drink water, but let them cry might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily unto</hi> God: would your continual faſt have been any reaſon for not bearing part in that general humiliation? doubtleſs it would not. You would have been as much concerned as any other, not to taſte food on that day.</p>
                     <p>No more would abſtinence, or the obſerving a continual faſt, have excuſed any of the children of Iſrael, from faſting on the tenth day of the ſeventh month, the great annual day of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>Let us beware of mocking God, of turning our faſt as well as our prayer into an abomination unto the Lord, by the mixture of any temporal view, particularly, by ſeeking the praiſe of men.

As the one guides all the motions of the body, ſo does the other thoſe of the ſoul. This eye of the ſoul is then ſaid to be ſingle, when it looks at one thing only; when we have no other deſign, but to <hi>know</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>whom he hath ſent:</hi> to know him with ſuitable affections, loving him as he hath loved us: to pleaſe God in all things: to ſerve God (as we love him) with all our heart and mind and ſoul and ſtrength: and to enjoy God in all and above all things, in time and in eternity.</p>

While thou ſeekeſt God in all things, thou ſhalt find him in all, the fountain of all holineſs, continually filling thee with his own likeneſs, with juſtice, mercy and truth. While thou lookeſt unto Jeſus and him alone, thou ſhalt be filled with the mind that was in him. Thy ſoul ſhall be renewed day by day, after the image of him that created it. If the eye of thy mind be not removed from him, if thou endureſt <hi>ſeeing him that is inviſible,</hi> and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing elſe in heaven or earth, then as thou beholdeſt the glory of the Lord, <hi>thou ſhall be transformed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, by the</hi> ſpirit <hi>of the</hi> Lord.</p>
                     <p>And it is alſo matter of daily experience, that <hi>by grace we are</hi> thus ſaved <hi>through faith.</hi> It is by faith that the eye of the mind is opened, to ſee the light of the glorious love of God.

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body ſhall be full of darkneſs. If thine eye be evil:</hi> we ſee there is no medium between a ſingle and an evil eye.

                     <p>With regard to moſt of the commandments of God, whether relating to the heart or life, the heathens of Africa or America ſtand much on a level, with thoſe that are called chriſtians. The chriſtians obſerve them (a few only being except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) very near as much as the heathens. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: the generality of the natives of England, commonly called chriſtians, are as ſober and as temperate, as the generality of the heathens, near the Cape of Good Hope. And ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>he Dutch or French chriſtians, are as humble and as chaſte, as the Choctaw or Cherokee-Indians. It is not eaſy to ſay, when we compare the bulk of the nations in <hi>Europe</hi> with thoſe in <hi>America,</hi> whether
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:028060_0491_0FD68E6F0EB1EEB0"/>the ſuperiority lies on the one ſide or the other. At leaſt the <hi>American</hi> has not much the advantage. But we cannot affirm this, with regard to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand now before us. Here the heathen has far the pre-eminence. He deſires and ſeeks nothing more than plain food to eat, and plain raiment to put on. And he ſeeks this only from day to day. He reſerves, he lays up nothing; unleſs it be, as much corn at one ſeaſon of the year, as he will need before that ſeaſon returns. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, therefore, the heathens, though they know it not, do conſtantly and punctually obſerve. They <hi>lay up for themſelves no treaſures upon earth;</hi> no ſtores of purple or ſine linen, of gold or ſilver, which either <hi>moth or ruſt may corrupt,</hi> or <hi>thieves break through and ſteal.</hi> But how do the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans obſerve, what they profeſs to receive as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the moſt high God? not at all; not in any degree; no more than if no ſuch command had ever been given to man. Even the <hi>good chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> as they are accounted by others as well as themſelves, pay no manner of regard thereto. It might as well be ſtill hid in its original <hi>Greek,</hi> for any notice they take of it. In what chriſtian ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do you find one man of five hundred, who makes the leaſt ſcruple, of laying up juſt as much treaſure as he can? of increaſing his goods juſt as far as he is able? there are indeed thoſe who would not do this unjuſtly; there are many who will neither rob nor ſteal; and ſome, who will not defraud their neighbour; nay, who will not gain, either by his ignorance or neceſſity. But this is quite another point. Even theſe do not ſcruple the thing but the manner of it. They do not
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028060_0492_0FD68E73AC46C720"/>ſcruple the <hi>laying up treaſures upon earth;</hi> but the laying them up by diſhoneſty. They do not ſtart at diſobeying Chriſt, but at a breach of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then morality. So that even theſe honeſt men do no more obey this command, than a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman or a houſe-breaker. Nay, they never deſigned to obey it. From their youth up, it never entered into their thoughts. They were bred up by their chriſtian parents, maſters and friends, without any inſtruction at all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: unleſs it were this, to break it as ſoon, and as much as they could, and to continue break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to their lives end.</p>

                     <p>We are not forbidden in this command, Firſt, <hi>to provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men,</hi> to
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:028060_0493_0FD68E74E6DCA390"/>provide wherewith we may <hi>render unto all their due,</hi> whatſoever they can juſtly demand of us. So far from it, that we are taught of God, to <hi>owe no man any thing.</hi> We ought therefore to uſe all diligence in our calling, in order to owe no man any thing: this being no other than a plain law of common juſtice, which our Lord came <hi>not to deſtroy, but to fulfil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither, Secondly, does he here forbid the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for ourſelves, ſuch things as are needful for the body; a ſufficiency of plain, wholeſome food to eat, and clean raiment to put on. Yea, it is our duty, ſo far as God puts it into our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to provide theſe things alſo; to the end we may <hi>eat our own bread,</hi> and be <hi>burdenſome to no man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor yet are we forbidden, Thirdly, to provide for our children, and for thoſe of our own houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. This alſo it is our duty to do, even upon principles of heathen morality. Every man ought to provide the plain neceſſaries of life, both for his own wife and children; and to put them into a capacity of providing theſe for themſelves, when he is gone hence and is no more ſeen. I ſay, of providing <hi>theſe,</hi> the plain neceſſaries of life, not delicacies, not ſuperfluities: and that by their <hi>diligent labour;</hi> for it is no man's duty to furniſh them any more than himſelf, with the means either of luxury or idleneſs. But if any man provide not thus far for his own children (as well as for <hi>the widows of his own houſe;</hi> of whom primarily St. Paul is ſpeaking, in thoſe well known words to Timothy:) <hi>he hath</hi> practically <hi>denied the faith, and is worſe than an infidel,</hi> or heathen.</p>

Laſtly, We are not forbidden in theſe words, to lay up from time to time, what is needful for the carrying on our worldly but neſs, in ſuch a meaſure and degree, as is ſufficient to anſwer the foregoing purpoſes: in ſuch a meaſure, as firſt, to owe no man any thing; ſecondly, to procure for ourſelves the neceſſaries of life; and thirdly, to furniſh thoſe of our own houſe with them while we live, and with the means of procuring them when we are gone to God.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. We may now clearly diſcern (unleſs we are unwilling to diſcern it) what that is which is forbidden here. It is, The deſignedly procuring more of this world's goods, than will anſwer the foregoing purpoſes: the labouring after a larger meaſure of worldly ſubſtance, a larger increaſe of gold and ſilver; the laying up any more than theſe ends require, is what is here expreſsly and abſolutely forbidden. If the words have any meaning at all, it muſt be this; for they are capable of no other. Conſequently, whoever he is, that owing no man any thing, and having food and raiment for himſelf and his houſehold, together with a ſufficiency to carry on his worldly buſineſs, ſo far as anſwers theſe reaſonable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: whoſoever, I ſay, being already in theſe circumſtances, ſeeks a ſtill larger portion on earth, he lives in an open habitual denial of the Lord that bought him.

                     <p>How pernicious to your own ſoul the latter of theſe is, has been excellently ſhewn by a late writer.

                     <p>"As wit and fine parts cannot be only trifled away, but will expoſe thoſe that have them to greater follies: ſo money cannot be only trifled away, but if it is not uſed according to reaſon and religion, will make people live a more ſilly and extravagant life, than they would have done without it: if therefore you dont ſpend your money in doing good to others, you muſt ſpend it to the hurt of yourſelf. You act like one that refuſes the cordial to his ſick friend, which he cannot drink himſelf without inflaming his blood. For this is the caſe of ſuperfluous money; if you give it to thoſe who want it, it is a cordial. If you ſpend it upon yourſelf in ſomething that you do not want, it only inflames and diſorders your mind."</p>

"In uſing riches where they have no real uſe, nor we any real want, we only uſe them to our great hurt, in creating unreaſonable deſires, in nouriſhing ill tempers, in indulging fooliſh paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſupporting a vain turn of mind. For high eating and drinking, fine cloaths and fine houſes, ſtate and equipage, gay pleaſures and diverſions, do all of them naturally hurt and diſorder our heart.

They are contrary to that ſobriety and piety of heart, which reliſhes divine things. They are ſo many weights upon our mind, that make us leſs able and leſs inclined to raiſe our thoughts and affections to things above."</p>
                     <p>"So that money thus ſpent is not merely waſted or loſt, but it is ſpent to bad purpoſes and miſerable effects; to the corruption and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our hearts, to the making us unable to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſublime doctrines of the goſpel.

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame judgment is paſt by the unerring ſpirit of God, and indeed by all, the eyes of whoſe underſtanding he hath opened, to diſcern the things of God, upon theſe poor chriſtians, commonly ſo called. If we ſpeak according to the truth and real nature of things, <hi>they fear not the</hi> Lord, <hi>neither do they ſerve him.</hi> For they do not <hi>after the covenant the</hi> Lord <hi>hath made with them; neither after the law and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he hath commanded them,</hi> ſaying, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve. <hi>They ſerve other gods</hi> unto this day.

                     <p n="3">3. How vain is it for any man to aim at this? To attempt the ſerving of two maſters.

Therefore, whatſoever the wiſe men of the world may ſuppoſe, <hi>Ye cannot ſerve</hi> God <hi>and mammon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Mammon</hi> was the name of one of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then gods, who was ſuppoſed to preſide over riches. It is here underſtood of riches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; gold and ſilver, or in general, money: and by a common figure of ſpeech, of all that may be purchaſed thereby; ſuch as eaſe, honour, and ſenſual pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>But what are we here to underſtand, by <hi>ſerving</hi> God? and what, by <hi>ſerving mammon?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We cannot <hi>ſerve</hi> God, unleſs we believe in him. This is the only true foundation of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. Therefore, the believing in God, as <hi>reconciling the world to himſelf</hi> through Chriſt Jeſus, the believing in him, as a loving, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning God, is the firſt great branch of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                     <p>And, thus to believe in God implies, to <hi>truſt</hi> in him as our ſtrength, without whom we can do nothing, who every moment endues us with power from on high, without which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe him: as our help, our only help in time of trouble, who compaſſeth us about with ſongs of deliverance: as our ſhield, our defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the lifter up of our head above all our enemies that are round about us.</p>
                     <p>It implies, to truſt in God as our happineſs; as the centre of ſpirits, the only reſt of our ſouls; the only good who is adequate to all
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028060_0517_0FD68EB3D4AAD138"/>our capacities, and ſufficient to ſatisfy all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires he hath given us.</p>
                     <p>It implies (what is nearly allied to the other) to truſt in God, as our end; to have an eye to him in all things; to uſe all things only as means of enjoying him: whereſoever we are, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we do, to ſee him that is inviſible, looking on us well-pleaſed, and refer all things to him in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Thus to believe, is the firſt thing we are to underſtand by <hi>ſerving</hi> God. The ſecond is, to love him.</p>
                     <p>Now, to love God in the manner the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcribes, in the manner God himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, and by requiring engages to work in us, is to love him as the one God; that is, <hi>with all our heart and with all our ſoul, and with all our mind, and with all our ſtrength:</hi> it is, to deſire God alone for his own ſake; and nothing elſe, but with reference to him: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in God; to delight in the Lord; not only to ſeek but find happineſs in him: to enjoy God as the chiefeſt among ten thouſand; to reſt in him, as our God and our all. In a word, to have ſuch a poſſeſſion of God, as makes us always happy.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. A third thing we are to underſtand by <hi>ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> God, is, to reſemble or imitate him.</p>

                     <p>We here ſpeak, of imitating or reſembling him in the ſpirit of our minds. For here the true chriſtian imitation of God begins. God
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:028060_0518_0FD68EB5515F8668"/>is a ſpirit; and they that imitate or reſemble him, muſt do it in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
                     <p>Now God is love. Therefore they who reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him in the ſpirit of their minds, are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the ſame image. They are merciful, even as he is merciful. Their ſoul is all love. They are kind, benevolent, compaſſionate, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted: and that not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward. Yea, they are, like him, loving unto every man, and their mercy extends to all his works.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. One thing more we are to underſtand by <hi>ſerving</hi> God, and that is, the obeying him; the glorifying him with our bodies, as well as with our ſpirits; the keeping his outward command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the zealouſly doing whatever he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, the carefully avoiding whatever he hath forbidden: the performing all the ordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, with a ſingle eye and a pure heart; offering them all in holy, fervent love, as ſacrifices to God, through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Let us conſider now, what we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, on the other hand, by <hi>ſerving mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> And firſt, it implies, the truſting in rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in money, or the things purchaſeable thereby, as our ſtrength, the means whereby we ſhall perform, whatever cauſe we have in hand: the truſting in them as our help, by which we look to be comforted in, or delivered out of trouble.</p>
                     <p>It implies, the truſting in the world for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; the ſuppoſing that <hi>a man's life conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> (the comfort of his life) <hi>in the abundance of
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:028060_0519_0FD68EBD28644948"/>the things which he poſſeſſeth:</hi> the looking for reſt, in the things that are ſeen; for content in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward plenty; the expecting that ſatisfaction in the things of the world, which can never be ſound out of God.</p>
                     <p>And if we do this, we cannot but make the world our end; the ultimate end, if not of all, at leaſt of many of our undertakings, many of our actions and deſigns: in which we ſhall aim only at an increaſe of wealth, at the obtaining plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or praiſe; at the gaining a larger meaſure of temporal things, without any reference to things eternal.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>ſerving mammon</hi> implies, Secondly, Loving the world; deſiring it for its own ſake; the placing our joy in the things thereof, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our hearts upon them; the ſeeking (what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is impoſſible we ſhould find) our happineſs therein; the reſting with the whole weight of our ſouls upon the ſtaff of this broken reed; although daily experience ſhews it cannot ſupport, but will only <hi>enter into our hand and pierce it.</hi>

                     <p>It is good and acceptable to God, that we ſhould ſo take thought concerning whatever we have in hand, as to have a clear comprehenſion of what we are about to do, and to plan our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs before we enter upon it.

He forbids only that care, which poiſons the bleſſings of to-day, by fear of what may be to-morrow; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy the preſent plenty, through apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of future want.

21. Perhaps the well obſerving this may give light to ſome other ſcriptures, which we have not always ſo clearly underſtood. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> concerning the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaith, <hi>They being ignorant of</hi> God's <hi>righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the righteouſneſs of</hi> God. They were <hi>ignorant of</hi> God's <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> not only of the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> imputed to every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, whereby all his ſins are blotted out, and he is reconciled to the favour of God: But (which ſeems here to be more immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) they were ignorant of that inward righteouſneſs, of that holineſs of heart, which is with the utmoſt propriety termed God's <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> as being borh his own free gift through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his own work, by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſpirit. And becauſe they were ignorant of this, they <hi>went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs.</hi> They laboured to eſtabliſh that outſide righteouſneſs, which might very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be termed <hi>their own.</hi> For neither was it wrought by the ſpirit of God, nor was it owned or accepted of him. They might work this them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by their own natural ſtrength: and when they had done, it was a ſtink in his noſtrils. And yet truſting in this, they would <hi>not ſubmit themſelves unto the righteouſneſs</hi> of God. Yea, they hardened themſelves againſt that faith whereby alone it was poſſible to attain it. <hi>For</hi> Chriſt <hi>is the end of the law, for righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth.

<pb n="271" facs="unknown:028060_0530_0FD68EDD950A3EE8"/>In ſeeking the peace and the love of God, you ſhall not only find what you more immediately ſeek, even the kingdom that cannot be moved; but alſo what you ſeek not, not at all for us own ſake, but only in reference to the other. You ſhall find in your way to the kingdom all outward things, ſo far as they are expedient for you: this care God hath taken upon himſelf: Caſt you all your care upon him. He knoweth your wants; and whatſoever is lacking, he will not fail to ſupply.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>Therefore take no thought for the morrow.</hi> Not only, take ye no thought, how to lay up treaſures on earth, how to increaſe in worldly ſubſtance; take no thought how to procure more food than you can eat, or more raiment than you can put on; or more money than is required from day to day, for the plain, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable purpoſes of life: but take no uneaſy thought even concerning thoſe things which are abſolutely needful for the body. Do not trouble yourſelf now, with thinking what you ſhall do, at a ſeaſon which is yet afar off. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that ſeaſon will never come: or it will be no concern of yours: before then you will have paſſed through all the waves, and be landed in eternity. All thoſe diſtant views do not belong to you, who are but a creature of a day. Nay, what have you to do with the <hi>morrow,</hi> more ſtrictly ſpeaking? Why ſhould you perplex your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without need? God provides for you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day what is needful to ſuſtain the life which he hath given you.

25. Above all, do not make the care of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, a pretence for neglecting preſent duty. This is the moſt fatal way of <hi>taking thought for the morrow.</hi> And how common is it among men? Many, if we exhort them to keep a conſcience void of offence, to abſtain from what they are convinced is evil, do not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to reply, "How then muſt we live? Muſt we not take care of ourſelves and of our families?" And this they imagine to be a ſufficient reaſon, for continuing in known, wilful ſin. They ſay, and perhaps think, they would ſerve God now; were it not that they ſhould by and by loſe their bread. They would prepare for eternity; but they are afraid of wanting the neceſſaries of life. So they ſerve the devil for a morſel of bread; they ruſh into hell, for fear of want; they throw away their poor ſouls, leſt they ſhould ſome time or other fall ſhort of what is needful for their bodies.</p>
                     <p>It is not ſtrange that they who thus take the matter out of God's hand, ſhould be ſo often diſappointed of the very things they ſeek; that while they throw away heaven, to ſecure the things of earth, they loſe the one, but do not gain the other. The jealous God, in the wiſe courſe of his providence, frequently ſuffers this. So that they who will not caſt their care on God, who taking thought for temporal things, have little concern for things eternal, loſe the very portion which they have choſen. There is a viſible blaſt on all their undertakings: Whatſoever they do, it doth not proſper. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that after they have forſaken God for the world, they loſe what they ſought, as well
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:028060_0532_0FD68EE417667A80"/>as what they ſought not. They fall ſhort of the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs; nor yet are other things added unto them.</p>

It is poſſible to <hi>take thought</hi> in a wrong manner, even with regard to ſpiritual things; to be ſo careful about what may be by and by, as to neglect what is now required at our hands. How inſenſibly do we ſlide into this, if we are not continually watching unto prayer? how eaſily are we carried away, in a kind of waking dream, projecting diſtant ſchemes, and drawing fine ſcenes in our own imagination! we think, what good we will do, when we are in ſuch a place, or when ſuch a time is come! how uſeful we will be, how plenteous in good works, when we are eaſier in our circumſtances? how earneſtly we will ſerve God, when once ſuch an hinderance is out of the way.</p>
                     <p>Or, perhaps, you are now in heavineſs of ſoul: God, as it were, hides his face from you. You ſee little of the light of his countenance; you cannot taſte his redeeming love. In ſuch a temper of mind, how natural is it to ſay. "O how I will praiſe God, when the light of his countenance ſhall be again lifted up upon my ſoul? how will I exhort others to praiſe him, when his love is again ſhed abroad in my heart? then I will do thus and thus: I will ſpeak for God in all places: I will not be aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt. Then I will redeem the time. I will uſe to the uttermoſt every talent I have received." Do not believe thyſelf. Thou wilt not do it then, unleſs thou doſt it now. <hi>He
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:028060_0533_0FD68EE554ADEA30"/>that is faithful in that which is little,</hi> of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever kind it be, whether it be worldly ſubſtance, or the fear or love of God, <hi>will be faithful in that which is much.</hi> But if thou now hideſt one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the earth, thou wilt then hide five: that is, if ever they are given; but there is ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect they ever will. Indeed <hi>unto him that hath,</hi> that is, uſes what he hath, <hi>ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundantly. But from him that hath not,</hi> that is, uſes not the grace which he hath already received, whether in a larger or ſmaller degree, <hi>ſhall be taken away even that which he hath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="27">27. And <hi>take no thought</hi> for the temptations of to-morrow. This alſo is a dangerous ſnare. Think not, "When ſuch a temptation comes, what ſhall I do, how ſhall I ſtand? I feel, I have not power to reſiſt: I am not able to conquer that enemy." Moſt true: you have not now the power which you do not now ſtand in need of. You are not able at <hi>this time</hi> to conquer that enemy; and at <hi>this time</hi> he does not aſſault you. With the grace you have now, you could not withſtand the temptations which you have not. But when the temptation comes, the grace will come. In greater trials you will have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtrength. When ſufferings abound, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of God will in the ſame proportion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound alſo. So that in every ſituation, the grace of God will be ſufficient for you. He doth not ſuffer you <hi>to be tempted</hi> to-day, <hi>above that ye are able to bear.</hi> And <hi>in every temptation he will make a way to eſcape.

                     <p n="1">1. OUR bleſſed Lord, having now finiſhed his main deſign, having firſt, delivered the ſum of true religion, carefully guarded againſt thoſe gloſſes of men, whereby they would make the word of God of none effect: and having, next, laid down rules touching that right inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we are to preſerve in all our outward actions: now proceeds to point out the main hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances of this religion, and concludes all with a ſuitable application.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the fifth chapter our great teacher has fully deſcribed inward religion in its various branches. He has there laid before us thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:028060_0538_0FD68EF16AE49740"/>of ſoul, which conſtitute real chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; the tempers contained in that holineſs, <hi>without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which when flowing from their proper fountain, from a living faith in God through Chriſt Jeſus, are intrinſically and eſſentially good, and acceptable to God. In the ſixth he has ſhewn, how all our actions likewiſe, even thoſe that are indifferent in their own nature, may be made holy and good, and acceptable to God, by a pure and holy intention. Whatever is done without this, he declares is of no value with God: whereas whatever outward works are thus conſecrated to God, are in his ſight of great price.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the former part of this chapter he points out the moſt common and moſt fatal hinderances of this holineſs. In the latter, he exhorts us by various motives, to break through all, and ſecure that prize of our high calling.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The firſt hinderance he cautions us againſt is judging. <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi> Judge not others, that ye be not judged of the Lord, that ye bring not vengeance on your own heads. <hi>For with what judgment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged, and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again:</hi> a plain and equitable rule, whereby God permits you to determine for yourſelves, in what manner he ſhall deal with you in the judgment of the great day.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is no ſtation of life, nor any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time, from the hour of our firſt repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing the goſpel, till we are made perfect in love, wherein this caution is not needful for every child of God. For occaſions
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:028060_0539_0FD68EF2D5C93988"/>of judging can never be wanting. And the temptations to it are innumerable: many where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſo artfully diſguiſed, that we fall into the ſin, before we ſuſpect any danger. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable are the miſchiefs produced hereby; always to him that judges another: thus wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own ſoul, and expoſing himſelf to the righteous judgment of God: and frequently to thoſe who are judged, whoſe hands hang down, who are weakened and hindered in their courſe, if not wholly turned out of the way, and cauſed to draw back even to perdition. Yea, how often, when this <hi>root of bitterneſs ſprings up,</hi> are <hi>many defiled thereby:</hi> by reaſon whereof the way of truth itſelf is evil ſpoken of, and that worthy name blaſphemed whereby we are called.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Yet it does not appear, that our Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned this caution, only or chiefly for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: but rather for the children of the world, for the men who know not God. Theſe cannot but hear of thoſe, who are not of the world, who ſollow after the religion above-deſcribed: who endeavour to be humble, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, gentle, merciful and pure in heart; who earneſtly deſire ſuch meaſures of theſe holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as they have not yet attained: and wait for them in doing all good to all men, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſuffering evil.

<pb n="283" facs="unknown:028060_0540_0FD68EF4FB473F48"/>Chriſt? why, in order to provide an excuſe for themſelves, they condemn thoſe whom they ought to imitate. They ſpend their time in finding out their neighbour's faults, inſtead of amending their own.

                     <p n="7">7.

Above all, with what ſupine careleſſneſs and indifference art thou dancing over the mouth of hell? and how then, with what grace, with what decency or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, <hi>wilt thou ſay to thy brother, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye,</hi> the exceſs of zeal for God, the extreme ſelf-denial, the too great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engagement from worldly cares and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the deſire to be day and night in prayer, or hearing the words of eternal life? <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a beam is in thine own eye!</hi> not a mote, like one of theſe. <hi>Thou hypocrite!</hi> who pretendeſt to care for others and haſt no care for thy own ſoul! who maketh a ſhow of zeal for the cauſe of God, when in truth thou neither loveſt nor feareſt him! <hi>firſt caſt out the beam out of thine own eye.</hi> Caſt out the beam of impenitence.
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:028060_0541_0FD68EF5CFDE1688"/>Know thyſelf. See and feel thyſelf a ſinner. Feel, that thy inward parts are very wickedneſs, that thou art altogether corrupt and abominable, and that the wrath of God abideth on thee. Caſt out the beam of pride. Abhor thyſelf. Sink down as in duſt and aſhes. Be more and more little and mean, and baſe and vile in thine own eyes. Caſt out the beam of ſelf-will. Learn what that meaneth, <hi>if any man will come after me, let him renounce himſelf.</hi> Deny thyſelf and take up thy croſs daily. Let thy whole ſoul cry out, <hi>I came down from heaven</hi> (for ſo thou didſt, thou never-dying ſpirit, whether thou knoweſt it or no) <hi>not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> Caſt out the beam of love of the world. Love not the world, neither the things of the world. Be thou crucified unto the world, and the world crucified unto thee. Only uſe the world, but <hi>enjoy</hi> God. Seek all thy happineſs in him. Above all, caſt out the grand beam, that ſupine careleſſneſs and indifference. Deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that <hi>one thing is needful,</hi> the one thing which thou haſt ſcarce ever thought of. Know and feel, that thou art a poor, vile, guilty worm, quivering over the great gulph! what art thou? a ſinner born to die: a leaf driven before the wind: a vapour ready to vaniſh away: juſt appearing, and then ſcattered into air, to be no more ſeen! ſee this, <hi>and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</hi> Then, if thou haſt leiſure from the concerns of thy own ſoul, thou ſhalt know how to correct thy brother alſo.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But what is properly the meaning of this word, <hi>judge not?</hi> what is the <hi>judging</hi> which is
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:028060_0542_0FD68EFB893F85F0"/>here forbidden? it is not the ſame as evil-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although it is frequently joined therewith. Evil-ſpeaking is, the relating any thing that is evil, concerning an abſent perſon: whereas judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may indifferently refer, either to the abſent or the preſent. Neither does it neceſſarily imply the ſpeaking at all, but only the <hi>thinking evil</hi> of another. Not, that all kind of thinking evil of others, is that judging which our Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns. If I ſee one commit robbery or murder, or hear him blaſpheme the name of God, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refrain from thinking ill of the robber or murderer. Yet this is not evil judging: there is no ſin in this, nor any thing contrary to tender affection.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The thinking of another, in a manner that is contrary to love, is that judging which is here condemned, and this may be of various kinds. For, firſt, we may think another to blame when he is not. We may lay to his charge (at leaſt in our own mind) the things of which he is not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the words which he has never ſpoke, or the actions which he has never done. Or we may think his manner of acting was wrong, although in reality it was not. And even where nothing can juſtly be blamed, either in the thing itſelf, or in the manner of doing it, we may ſuppoſe, his intention was not good, and ſo condemn him on that ground; at the ſame time that he who ſearches the heart, ſees his ſimplicity and godly ſincerity.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. But we may not only fall into the ſin of judging, by condemning the innocent, but alſo, ſecondly, by condemning the guilty, in a higher degree than he deſerves. This ſpecies of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:028060_0543_0FD68EFCA4833E88"/>is likewiſe an offence againſt juſtice as well as mercy: and yet ſuch an offence as nothing can ſecure us from, but the ſtrongeſt and tendereſt affection. Without this, we readily ſuppoſe one who is acknowledged to be in fault, to be more in fault than he really is. We undervalue whatever good is found in him. Nay, we are not eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe, that any thing good can remain in him, in whom we have found any thing that is evil.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. All this ſhews a manifeſt want of that love, which <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Thinketh no evil:</hi> which never draws an unjuſt or unkind conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from any premiſes whatſoever. Love will not infer, from a perſon's falling once into an act of open ſin, that he is accuſtomed ſo to do, that he is habitually guilty of it. And if he was habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guilty once, love does not conclude, he is ſo ſtill: much leſs, that if he is now guilty of this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is guilty of other ſins alſo. Theſe evil reaſonings all pertain to that ſinful judging, which our Lord here guards us againſt: and which we are in the higheſt degree concerned to avoid, if we love either God or our own ſouls.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. But ſuppoſing we do not condemn the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, neither the guilty any farther than they deſerve: ſtill we may not be altogether clear of the ſnare. For there is a third ſort of ſinful judging, which is the condemning any perſon at all where there is not a ſufficient evidence. And be the facts we ſuppoſe ever ſo true, yet that does not acquit us. For they ought not to have been ſuppoſed but proved, and till they were, we ought to have formed no judgment, I ſay, till
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:028060_0544_0FD68EFE6B39A0C8"/>they were: for neither are we excuſed, although the facts admit of ever ſo ſtrong proof, unleſs that proof be produced before we paſs ſentence, and compared with the evidence on the other ſide. Nor can we be excuſed, if ever we paſs a full ſentence, before the accuſed has ſpoken for himſelf. Even a jew might teach us this, as a mere leſſon of juſtice abſtracted from mercy and brotherly love. <hi>Doth our law,</hi> ſays Nicodemus, <hi>Judge any man before it hear him and know what he doth? John.</hi> xvii. 51. Yea, a heathen could reply, when the chief of the jewiſh nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have judgment againſt his priſoner, <hi>it is not the manner of the Romans to</hi> judge <hi>any man before he that is accuſed have the accuſers face to face, and have licence to anſwer for himſelf, concerning the crime laid againſt him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. Indeed we could not eaſily fall into ſinful <hi>judging,</hi> were we only to obſerve that rule, which<note n="*" place="bottom">Seneca.</note> another of thoſe heathen <hi>Romans</hi> affirms to have been the meaſure of his own practice. "I am ſo far, ſays he, from lightly believing every man's, or any man's evidence againſt another, that I do not eaſily or immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a man's evidence againſt himſelf. I always allow him ſecond thoughts, and many times council too." Go thou who art called a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and do likewiſe, leſt the heathen riſe and condemn thee in that day.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. But how rarely ſhould we condemn or judge one another, at leaſt, how ſoon would that evil be remedied, were we to walk by that clear and expreſs rule, which our Lord himſelf has taught us? <hi>If thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee</hi>
                        <pb n="288" facs="unknown:028060_0545_0FD68F0083CD6B50"/>(or if thou hear, or believe that he hath) <hi>go and tell him of his fault, between him and thee alone.</hi> This is the firſt ſtep thou art to take. <hi>But if he will not hear, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſtabliſhed.</hi> This is the ſecond ſtep. <hi>If he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church;</hi> either to the overſeers thereof, or to the whole congregation. Thou haſt then done thy part. Then think of it no more, but commend the whole to God.</p>

Be not weary or faint in your mind. Preſs on to the mark. Take no denial. Let him not go until he bleſs you. And the door of mercy, of holineſs, of heaven <hi>ſhall be opened unto you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. It is in compaſſion to the hardneſs of our hearts, ſo unready to believe the goodneſs of God, that our Lord is pleaſed to enlarge upon this head, and to repeat and confirm what he hath ſpoken. <hi>For every one,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that aſketh, receiveth:</hi> ſo that none need come ſhort of the bleſſing: <hi>and he that ſeeketh,</hi> even every one that ſeeketh, <hi>findeth,</hi> the love and the image of God: <hi>and to him that knocketh,</hi> to every one that knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the gate of righteouſneſs ſhall be opened. So that here is no room for any to be diſcouraged, as though they might aſk or ſeek or knock in vain. Only remember, <hi>always to pray,</hi> to ſeek, to knock <hi>and not to be faint</hi> And then the promiſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſure. It is firm as the pillars of heaven. Yea, more firm; for heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but his word ſhall not paſs away.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. To cut off every pretence for unbelief, our bleſſed Lord, in the following verſes, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:028060_0550_0FD68F0B9DE1EED0"/>yet farther what he had ſaid, by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to what paſſes in our own breaſts. <hi>What man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is there of</hi> you, <hi>who, if his ſon aſk bread, will he give him a ſtone?</hi> will even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection permit you to refuſe the reaſonable requeſt of one you love? <hi>or if he aſk a fiſh, will he give him a ſerpent?</hi> will he give him hurtful, inſtead of profitable things? ſo that even from what you feel and do yourſelves, you may receive the fulleſt aſſurance, as, on the one hand, that no ill effect can poſſibly attend your aſking, ſo on the other, that it will be attended with that good effect, a full ſupply of all your wants. For <hi>if ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father which is in heaven,</hi> who is pure, unmixed, eſſential good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>give good things to them that aſk him?</hi> or, (as he expreſſes it on another occaſion) <hi>give the Holy Ghoſt to them that aſk him?</hi> In him are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all good things; all wiſdom, peace, joy, love: the whole treaſure of holineſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: all that God hath prepared for them that love him.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. But that your prayer may have its full weight with God, ſee that ye be in charity with all men. For otherwiſe, it is more likely to bring a curſe than a bleſſing on your own head: nor can you expect, to receive any bleſſing from God, while you have not charity towards your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Therefore let this hinderance be removed without delay. Confirm your love towards one another and towards all men. And love them, not in word only, but in deed and in truth. <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would, that
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:028060_0551_0FD68F0DB047D530"/>men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo unto them: for this is the have and the prophets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="22">22. This is that royal law, that golden rule of mercy as well as juſtice, which even the heathen emperor cauſed to be written over the gate of his palace: a rule, which many believe to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally engraved on the mind of every one that comes into the world. And thus much is certain, that it commends itſelf, as ſoon as heard, to every man's conſcience and underſtanding: inſomuch that no man can knowingly offend againſt it, without carrying his condemnation in his own breaſt.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. <hi>This is the law and the prophets.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is written in that law which God of old revealed to mankind; and whatſoever precepts God has given by <hi>his holy prophets, which have been ſince the world began,</hi> they are all ſummed up in theſe few words, they are all contained in this ſhort direction. And this rightly underſtood comprizes the whole of that religion, which our Lord came to eſtabliſh upon earth.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. It may be underſtood, either in a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or negative ſenſe. If underſtood in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative ſenſe, the meaning is, "Whatever ye would not that men ſhould do to you, do not ye unto them." Here is a plain rule, always ready at hand, always eaſy to be applied. In all caſes relating to your neighbour, make this caſe your own. Suppoſe the circumſtances to be changed, and yourſelf to be juſt as he is now. And then beware that you indulge no temper or thought, that no word paſs out of your lips, that you take no ſtop which you ſhould have condemned
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:028060_0552_0FD68F0E942954C8"/>in him, upon ſuch a change of circumſtances. If underſtood in a direct and poſitive ſenſe, the plain meaning of it is, "Whatſoever you could reaſonably deſire of him, ſuppoſing yourſelf to be in his circumſtance, that do, to the uttermoſt of your power, to every child of man."</p>
                     <p n="25">25. To apply this in one or two obvious inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is clear to every man's own conſcience, we would not that others ſhould <hi>judge</hi> us, ſhould cauſeleſsly or lightly think evil of us. Much leſs would we that any ſhould ſpeak evil of us, ſhould publiſh our real faults or infirmities. Apply this to yourſelf. Do not unto another what you would not he ſhould do unto you; and you will never more <hi>judge</hi> your neighbour, never cauſeleſsly or lightly think evil of any one. Much leſs will you ſpeak evil: You will never mention even the real fault of an abſent perſon, unleſs ſo far as you are convinced, it is abſolutely needful, for the good of other ſouls.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Again: We would that all men ſhould love and eſteem us, and behave towards us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to juſtice, mercy and truth. And we may reaſonably deſire, that they ſhould do us all the good they can do, without injuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Yea, that in outward things (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the known rule) their ſuperfluities ſhould give way to our conveniencies, their convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to our neceſſities, and their neceſſities to our extremities. Now then let us walk by the ſame rule: Let us do unto all, as we would they ſhould do to us. Let us love and honour all men. Let juſtice, mercy and truth govern all our minds and actions. Let our ſuperfluities give way to our neighbour's conveniencies: (and who then will
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:028060_0553_0FD68F106E4D7C30"/>have any ſuperfluities left?) Our conveniencies to our neighbour's neceſſities, our neceſſities to his extremities.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. This is pure and genuine morality. This do and thou ſhalt live. <hi>As many as walk by this rule, peace be to them, and mercy:</hi> for they are the <hi>Iſrael of</hi> God. But then be it obſerved, none can walk by this rule (nor ever did from the beginning of the world) none can love his neighbour as himſelf, unleſs he firſt love God. And none can love God, unleſs he believe in Chriſt, unleſs he have redemption thro' his blood, and the ſpirit of God bearing witneſs with his ſpirit, that he is a child of God. Faith therefore is ſtill the root of all, of preſent as well as future ſalvation. Still we muſt ſay to every ſinner, Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Thou ſhalt be ſaved now, that thou mayſt be ſaved for ever; ſaved on earth, that thou mayſt be ſaved in heaven Believe in him and thy faith will work by love. Thou wilt love the Lord thy God, becauſe he hath loved thee: Thou wilt love thy neighbour as thyſelf. And then it will be thy glory and joy, to exert and increaſe this love, not barely by abſtaining from what is contrary thereto, from every unkind thought, word and action, but by ſhewing all that kindneſs to every man, which thou wouldſt he ſhould ſhew unto thee.</p>
