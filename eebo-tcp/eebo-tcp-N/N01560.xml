            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Decay of Family Piety is an awful Symptom of the Dying State of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion among a People: And if ever GOD ſhews Mercy to a Degenerate Land, He will pour out His Spirit upon Families, and thereby give a Glorious Reſurrection to Religion in them.</p>
            <p>THAT there is a Scandalous Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in this Day of Apoſtacy, in all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Parts of that Service, which GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of Heads of Families with their Houſes, is too notorious to be Denyed,
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:001854_0004_0FB91CC0C2F76258"/>and too reproachful to Chriſtianity, not to be Lamented, with the moſt ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſentments of Soul, by all, that have the Glory of CHRIST, and the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Souls at Heart.</p>
            <p>THIS flows not from Mens Ignorance of their Duty; but from their reſolved obſtinacy, and willfull Inconſideration, which hinders them from a juſt ſenſe of their many Obligations hereto.</p>
            <p>THERE are indeed ſome, who call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who pretend they ſee no Warrant or Obligation to <hi>Family-Prayer,</hi> which is a Principal part of that Service, we owe to GOD with our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: They therefore Demand an Expreſs Precept for Divine Worſhip in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: And with this they hope to juſtify their Criminal Neglect of this Duty. But aſſuredly whatever trifling Pleas any may make to ſilence the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Conſcience; yet few or none
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:001854_0005_0FB91CC196B5D7C0"/>in their cool and ſerious Thoughts, can think them ſufficient to acquit them from Guilt at the Bar of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> much leſs at the Tribunal of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, ſince there are ſuch, as ſeem to doubt of their Obligations to this Eſſential Part of Family-Religion; I ſhall Offer a few Hints, which may Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and Aſſiſt their Powers of Thought and Reflection to a ſight of the Equity and Reaſonableneſs, the Expediency and Neceſſity of Family Worſhip.</p>
            <p>HERE it may be Obſerved that the Obligation to this Duty, is Originally Founded in the Law and Light of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and not on Poſitive <hi>Inſtitution:</hi> And by Conſequence, the leſs need to require an Expreſs Direction for it in <hi>Revelation.</hi> Yet we are not without plain Intimations of it in Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and Precepts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:001854_0006_0FB91CC563076840"/>
AGREEABLE hereto we find Solemn Acts of Worſhip attended in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; In <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we find him Pitching his Tent, there we ſee him <hi>Erecting an Altar</hi> of Worſhip: And there appear Evident Indications that this was <hi>Job</hi>'s, <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s, and <hi>David</hi>'s Practiſe. And moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, this was intended in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; Act. 10.2. <hi>He feared GOD,</hi> i. e. Worſhipped Him <hi>with all his Houſe.</hi> In many Places of the New-Teſtament we have this Duty pointed at. We are Commanded to <hi>Pray with all Prayer,</hi> Eph. 6 18. Which certainly includes Family-Prayer. And when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had lay'd down the Duties of the ſeveral Members of a Family, he then Exhorts them <hi>as One to continue in Prayer,</hi> Col. 4.2. And <hi>to Pray together.</hi> verſe 3. as that Place might be more juſtly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. This ſort of Prayer the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to have his Eye upon, in that Admonition, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. But we need
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:001854_0007_0FB91CC6D859FE58"/>not inſiſt on theſe; ſince this is an Act of Natural Worſhip, and not purely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted; and as ſuch approves it ſelf to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſon and Conſcience of Men.</p>
            <p>HENCE, all Nations, who were ſo juſt as to acknowledge a <hi>GOD</hi> and a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> have conſpired in the Practiſe hereof. The Heathen under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Light of Nature Erected their <hi>Family-Altars,</hi> and Offered Daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in their Houſes.</p>
            <p>AND if the Foundation of Divine Worſhip in General be conſidered, it will ſtrongly Enforce the Practiſe of Family-Devotion. The Fundamental Reaſons of Divine Worſhip flow from the Nature of GOD, and that ſtate of abſolute Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and neceſſary Subjection that Man ſtands in to ſuch a Glorious Being. The Relation that reaſonable Creatures ſtand in to the Bleſſed GOD, a Being of Infinite Excellency and Perfection, as He is their
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:001854_0008_0FB91CC856785990"/>Creator, Preſerver and Benefactor, their Owner, Lord and Lawgiver; does Infer an immutable Obligation to pay this Divine Homage and Worſhip. Now will not our Obligations, for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, be as ſtrong to pay GOD the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>Family-Worſhip?</hi> Sure we are, That GOD is the Founder, Father, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, and Owner of <hi>Families:</hi> By His Care and Providence our Houſes are Built, our Families Subſiſt, Grow and Flouriſh. What then more juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than to Worſhip Him as the GOD of our Families, and the Fountain of all their Bleſſings? And by Solemn Joynt-Prayer in our Houſes religiouſly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge His Propriety in, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us and our Houſes; and our Dependance on and Subjection to Him. This certainly is one way to give GOD the Honour due to His Name. Family Prayer is on this account GOD's Right; and to with-hold it will be found Groſs Injuſtice, and Black Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:001854_0009_0FB91CCA9B296E20"/>
IT is acknowledged by all, that the more Publick the Honour we pay to GOD, the greater it is: Now <hi>Family-Worſhip</hi> is more Honourable to GOD on this account, than <hi>Solitary:</hi> And ſince we are bound to Worſhip GOD in the beſt manner we can, we muſt conclude our Family-Sacrifices muſt not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, The Neceſſity and Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Family-Prayer will be Evident if we Conſider, That this Religious Practiſe has a neceſſary and direct Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote all other Holy, and Religious Intentions in a Family. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Heads of Families themſelves are awed to a greater Circumſpection and Care in their walk before their Houſes: And it has a bleſſed Tendency to beget and cheriſh an awful Senſe of GOD in the Hearts of the whole Family; and to Awaken them to a juſt concern for their Souls: This tends to give Life and Force to all the Solemn Counſels, Inſtructions
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:001854_0010_0FB91CCEACE40120"/>and Admonitions given by Parents and Maſters in the Name of GOD to thoſe under their Charge. And in theſe reſpects Family-Worſhip muſt be accounted what is Good, and what the Lord requires of us.</p>
            <p>IN a Word, I can't ſee what juſt claim a Family, as ſuch a Society, has to the Character of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Religious</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, if <hi>Family-Prayer</hi> and Worſhip be wholly neglected.</p>
            <p>IF after all, any will indulge themſelves in the neglect of this Duty; and pleaſe themſelves that they are not under Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation hereto: I would take Liberty to Leave Two or Three Enquiries with them to be reſolved.</p>
            <p>DO you really believe GOD is as well pleaſed with, and as much honoured by your Omiſſion of Family-Prayer, as He would be by a Religious Performance of it?</p>
            <p>DO you apprehend that you have done all in your power for the Good of the Souls of your Family; while you neglect to Pray with them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:001854_0011_0FB91CCFD6F096D0"/>
DARE you adviſe your Children, when they come to ſettle in Houſes of their own, to follow your Example, and live in the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Prayer in their Families?</p>
            <p>IN a Word, Are you willing that Death ſhould overtake you, while you live in the Omiſſion of this part of Worſhip? Can you ſay, upon mature Deliberation, that you expect as much Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in a Dying Hour, from a Reflection on the <hi>Neglect,</hi> as on the Conſcientious <hi>Diſcharge</hi> hereof? Let Conſcience An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: and be Obſequious to it's Voice. And then I doubt not this Neglected Duty would be Revived; and Family-Sacrifices daily offer'd to GOD, <hi>i. e.</hi> Morning and Evening: Thus was the daily Sacrifice under the Law offer'd Morning and Evening. And if daily Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Wants and Mercies do Challenge daily Supplications and Thankſgivings from particular Perſons: by a Parity of Reaſon, The Wants and Mercies of a
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:001854_0012_0FB91CD1567F2F90"/>Family, which are daily and continual, do require daily Addreſſes from them in Conſort. And nothing can be more Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Beautiful, nor more agreeable to the Ends of ſuch a Duty, than for all the Members of a Family to Unite with one Mouth and Heart to <hi>ſhew forth the Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kindneſs of the LORD in the Morning: however that he, we Evening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND nothing can be more Worthy the Thought and Care of CHRIST's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who are called to Watch for Souls, and muſt give an Account of them, than with great Frequency, and all poſſible Importunity, to Inculcate this great Duty upon their Charge.</p>
            <p>NOW this Principal part of Family-Religion, together with all other Acts and Inſtances thereof, is recommended to us in the following Solid, and Judicious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes: which are every way adapted to Revive the Power of Godlineſs in our Houſes.</p>

            <p>AND, as I do heartily bleſs <hi>GOD,</hi> who directed the Thoughts of His Servant to this Subject, and aſſiſted him in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations hereon; ſo cannot but joyn with him in Recommending the Serious Peruſal of them to all Heads of Families; but more eſpecially to thoſe under our Joynt Paſtoral Care: And do hope, by the Preſence and Bleſſing of CHRIST with theſe Labours of my Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, more of the Beauty of Holineſs may
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:001854_0014_0FB91CD51681D358"/>be ſeen, and more of the Gracious Preſence of GOD enjoy'd in our Houſes.</p>
            <p>LET us therefore in Fidelity to the Truſt GOD has committed to us; and which ere-long we muſt give an Account of before the Bar of CHRIST; and in Compaſſion to the Souls of our Children and Servants, which we have undertaken the Charge of, Let us, I ſay, Entertain and Practiſe the Counſels of Wiſdom here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us: Let us uſe our utmoſt Endeavours that we and our Houſes may Serve the LORD with a perfect Heart and a willing Mind. In this way we may hope to be found of our Judge in Peace, and have our part in the Glories and Satisfactions of the Reſurrection-World. For which holy Purpoſes the following Sermons are with Fervency Recommended to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit of Grace.</p>

            <p>It's uncertain who was the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of this Part of Sacred Writ: Some Conjecture that <hi>Joſhua</hi> Wrote it himſelf: however that be, we
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001854_0016_0FB91CDA5924BCB0"/>know it was Written of him, and is a very notable and entertaining Hiſtory of the wonderful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of GOD towards His People, and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, under his Adminiſtration. It acquaints us how GOD brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> with an high hand, and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched arm, dividing the Waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> delivering into their hands the Kings of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites,</hi> their Lands, and Cities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>JOSHUA</hi> was an eminent Type of CHRIST both in Name and Office. His Name beſpeaks, him to be a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and is the ſame with <hi>Jeſus</hi> only <hi>Joſhua</hi> retains the <hi>Hebrew; Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> termination. Agreeably He is call'd <hi>Jeſus</hi> by the Seventy; and alſo in the New-Teſtament. And indeed JESUS is the True JOSHUA, the <hi>Saviour</hi> of GOD's <hi>Iſrael;</hi> He is the <hi>Captain of our Salvation, and was given to be a Leader and Commander to the People,</hi> to Lead them to thoſe glorious Manſions prepared for them in the <hi>Heavenly Canaan. Moſes</hi> did not lead <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan;</hi> for the Law made nothing Perfect; but <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, and therein he was a Type of Chriſt, who hath His Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe <hi>He Saves His People from their Sins;</hi> Subdues their Enemies for them, and conducts them to their Everlaſting Reſt.</p>
            <p>BUT to return, In this Chapter wherein is our Text, we have an account of ſome of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Things which <hi>Joſhua</hi> did juſt before his Death. Great were the Pains which he took to Eſtabliſh GOD's Ancient People in His true Faith and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>FOR this End, (1) <hi>Joſhua</hi> aſſembled all the Tribes at <hi>Sichem.</hi> (2) He put them in mind of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001854_0017_0FB91CDBD859F2A0"/>the wonderful Favours which GOD had ſhown to their Fathers, and themſelves. (3) He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd the Narrative which he had given of GOD's Wonderful and Miraculous Appearances for them, in a Word of Exhortation, and a ſolemn Charge, to Fear and Serve the LORD. (4) He call'd upon them to determine, and chooſe whom they would Serve; and makes a ſolemn Proteſtation for himſelf, and Family, that they would Serve the LORD. (5) He renew'd the Covenant of the LORD with the People, Wrote theſe Words in the Book of the Law, and ſet up a great Stone as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of this Covenant-Tranſaction, and as a Witneſs of their Engagements to be the LORD's.</p>
            <p>THE Words of our Text contain the Call which <hi>Joſua</hi> gives the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to chooſe and determine whom they would Serve, and the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Proteſtation which He makes for Himſelf, and Houſhold, that they would Serve the LORD.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I Name the DOCTRINE intended Principally to be inſiſted on, I ſhall mention ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Doctrinal Obſervations from theſe Words, and as they ſtand related to the Context.</p>
            <p>Obſer. I. <hi>THEY that would Serve the LORD; muſt Renounce Obedience to Satan, the World, and their Luſts; and must Reſolve to be for GOD, and for no other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſer. II. <hi>IF we would Engage in the Service of GOD; We muſt do it Deliberately, and of Choice.</hi>

Obſer. IV. <hi>ALTHOUGH the Genernlity of a Profeſſing People ſhould forſake the LORD, and Serve other gods: Yet we ſhould reſolutely Adhere to Him, and continue Stedfaſt in His Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſer. I. <hi>THEY that would Serve the LORD; they muſt Renounce Obedience to Satan, the World, and their Luſts: and muſt Reſolve to be for GOD, and for no other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR Saviour hath Aſſur'd us, that <hi>No man can Serve Two Maſters:</hi> for either he will hate the One, and love the Other; or elſe he will hold to the One, and deſpiſe the Other, <hi>Ye cannot Serve GOD and Mammon,</hi> Mat. 6.24. We cannot Serve GOD and our Luſts; GOD, and this Sinful World: for they are Contrary, as Light and Darkneſs. The Truth of this doctrinal Propoſition will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, as Written with a Sun-beam, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>WE Wave but ONE Supream LORD, the Eternal GOD.</hi> Indeed, it is inconſiſtent with the Nature of the Thing, and implys the greateſt Contradiction, that there ſhould be Two Supream Infinite Beings eſſentially diſtinct. GOD is One: Deut. 6.4. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, The LORD our God is One LORD.</hi> He who is Omniſcient tells us, that He knows not any beſides Himſelf, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.8. There are Three Perſons in the Godhead, The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt: But then theſe <hi>Three</hi> are Eſſentially <hi>One;</hi> One in the ſame Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Eſſence, and all the Eſſential Glories of it. Accordingly, the bleſſed GOD can brook no Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; He muſt be Lov'd with <hi>all</hi> the Heart; and nothing elſe muſt be lov'd at all, but in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001854_0019_0FB91CE09397BB58"/>to Him. He muſt be Obey'd without Limitation, and Served with all our Powers. And therefore if we would Serve the LORD; we muſt deny Obedience to <hi>Satan,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and our <hi>Luſts;</hi> and by the Grace of God, bring every proud Thought and Imagination, into Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to His Will. If GOD Rule in our hearts, and be enthroned there; the government of Satan, and Luſt, and the World, muſt be pulled down.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>THE Laws whereby the bleſſed GOD Governs His People, are directly contrary to the law of Sin, and the corrupt rules and maxims of a Sinful World.</hi> For the Law of GOD is holy; and the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holy, and juſt, and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. And therefore while the Mind is under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and influence of Sin, and Satan, who rules in the hearts of the Children of Diſobedience; it's Enmity againſt GOD, is not ſubject to His Law, nor indeed can be. For it's impoſſible to live in Obedience to the Law of GOD, and the law of Sin, at the ſame time: for their Commands are Contrary; ſo that if we Obey One, in that very article we diſobey the Other. Certainly then, if we would Serve the LORD; we muſt forſake Sin, and the World, and ſay with them: Iſai. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet 'tis to be fear'd, there are not a few who are guilty of this Folly. They can't bear to be divorced from their beloved Luſts; but hold faſt their Iniquities, and refuſe to let them go. There are not a few that ſet up an idol of Jealouſly in their hearts; prefer the Pleaſures, or Profits, or Honours of this World before the bleſſed GOD; and yet preſume that they are the Servants of the LORD, and upon good Terms with Him: now this is moſt Unreaſonable and Contradictory.

But let us now go to GOD, fall down at His Feet, and Cry to Him to pull down the ſtrong Holds of Satan; and to ſet up His Kingdom in our hearts. Let us be earneſt with Him to deliver us from the Cruel Tyranny of our Luſts, which ſeek the Ruine of our Immortal Souls; and that He would Vindicate us into the Liberty of the Sons of GOD, and make us the LORD's Freemen.

But the All ſeeing GOD cannot be thus impos'd upon. So that if we would Serve Him to any good Purpoſe, we muſt be Hearty and in Earneſt, and not think to deceive GOD with a ſhew of Piety, and an External Form of Godlineſs.

When Iniquity abounds, and the love of many waxeth Cold; We muſt ſtrive that our Zeal for GOD, and the fervour of our Spirit, be thereby invigorated and increaſed as by an holy Antiperiſtaſis. The Conſideration of this ſhould inflame us with ardent deſires to do much for GOD, and to abound in every good Work. This ſhould the rather make us Reſolve, that tho' Multitudes forſake CHRIST, yet will not we; and this not with carnal Confidence; but with humble Truſt and Dependence on GOD. We muſt remember that there is no Authority in the Voice of the <hi>Many</hi> or the <hi>Mighty</hi> to legitimat Vice. Tho' hand join in hand the Sinner ſhall not go Unpuniſhed.

THIS is the way to teſtify our Fidelity to GOD, and to obtain diſtinguiſhing Marks of His favour. A Friend is tryed in a Day of Adverſity; and ſo is a Man's Fidelity to GOD, in an hour of ſuch Temptation. In this way we ſhall give a Seaſonable Teſtimony for GOD, and ſet to our Seal to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Truth of Religion. This alſo is the way to obtain the peculiar Marks of GOD's Favour: Ezek. 9.4, 5. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto him, go through the midſt of the City, through the midſt of Jeruſalem, and ſet a mark upon the Fore-heads of the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midſt thereof. And to the others he ſaid in mine hearing, go ye after him through the City, and ſmite,</hi> — They that diſtinguiſh themſelves by their Fidelity in GOD's Service in times of abounding iniquity, will have encouraging grounds of hope that GOD will remember them in Mercy when He brings Evil upon a degenerate People, and take them into the ſecret Chambers of His Protection until the Indignation be over-paſt. Moreover, a few thus Spirited may be Inſtrumental to Reform a backſliding People, and to Save them from Ruine. Such will ſtand in the Gap, and may by the Grace of GOD, be employed to make up the breach, and to keep off impending Judgment from a People. Had there been Ten Righteous Perſons found in <hi>Sodom,</hi> GOD would have ſpared the Place for their ſake.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine principally to be inſiſted on, is this,</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>IT is our indiſpenſible Duty to Reſolve, in the ſtrength of GOD's Grace, That we will Serve the LORD; And the Heads of Families ſhould not only Serve GOD themſelves, but alſo take care that their Houſes joyn with them in Serving the LORD.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THIS is fairly implyed in our Text. For here we have <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Reſolution reſpecting himſelf, <hi>But as for me</hi> — It nearly concerns every One of us to ſay, <hi>I will Serve the LORD.</hi> We have not all of us the Charge of a Family committed to us; but we are all of us obliged to take up this holy Reſolution for our Selves, that we will Serve the LORD. And unleſs we give up our Selves to the LORD, there will be little Probability that we ſhall labour to engage Others in His Service. Here then in the firſt Place, we may Conſider this great Duty as incumbent upon each, and every One of us Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality.</p>
            <p>Firſt, WE are to Enquire, What's imply'd in Serving the LORD?</p>
            <p>Secondly, WHAT Obligations we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly under to the Performance of this Duty? The Firſt of theſe is very Large and Comprehenſive, and includes all that Duty and Obedience which we owe to GOD. To Serve GOD implies that we Own and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Him for our Supream LORD and Maſter, that we yield Obedience to Him in all things. We muſt ſubject our Underſtanding, Will, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001854_0031_0FB91CF857F9A260"/>Affections, and all our Powers unto GOD; to be Guided and Governed by Him. If we would be the Servants of GOD, we muſt no longer walk in the way of our own Heart, and ſight of our own Eyes; but muſt conform to the Will of GOD reveal'd in His Holy Word, making the Law of GOD the Rule of our Lives and Actions. Rom. 6.16. <hi>His Servants you are to whom you Obey.</hi> In this manner we muſt Honour and Reverence GOD. Mal. 1.6. <hi>A Son honoureth his Father, and a Servant his Master,</hi> by Obedience. Serving the LORD intends, that we look to Him for Direction in our Work. Act. 9.6. <hi>LORD, what wilt thou have me to do!</hi> And then, it intends, that we do all with an Eye to GOD's Glory. Servants are Oblig'd to ſeek their Maſters Profit in what they do. And if we would approve our ſelves the Faithful Servants of GOD, we muſt not ſeek our own Glory, but the Glory of GOD. Rom. 14.7, 8. <hi>For none of us liveth to himſelf, and no Man dreth to himſelf</hi> — We muſt Study how we may ſpend our Time, and lay out our ſelves ſo as ſhall be moſt for GOD's Honour, and for the Advancement of the Intereſt of His Kingdom. We muſt take cure to Engage with all our Heart and Strength in the more immediate Service of GOD; and ſee that we keep our Secular Affairs in a due Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It might have been ſaid, that our Obedience to GOD muſt be Free and Unconſtrained, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and Univerſal, Conſtant and Uniform.

            <p>THE Great GOD is the Author of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; He formed Man at firſt out of the Duſt of the Earth, and breath'd into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life. Rev. 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthy, O LORD, to receive Glory &amp; Honour &amp; Power: for Thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created.</hi> Now, as our Creator, GOD is our Lord Proprietor, and juſtly Challengeth an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Right and Title to our Perſons, and all our Services. Rom. 11.36. <hi>Of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things.</hi> And certainly, ſeeing we are of the LORD as the Primary Efficient of our Being; we are under the ſtrongeſt Bonds to Serve Him. There's no need of our Signing <hi>Indentures,</hi> in order to GOD's Claiming a Right to us, and our Services: for the Law of our <hi>Creation</hi> binds us in indiſſoluble Bonds to be the LORD's Servants. Pſal. 95.6, 7. <hi>O come, let us worſhip &amp; how down; let us kneel before the LORD our MAKER. For He is Our GOD, and we are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of His Paſture, and the Sheep of His Hand.</hi> GOD's Hand hath formed and faſhion'd us; given us Life and Being: and therefore we muſt devote our ſelves unto Him. It is He that hath made us, and that hath made us Creatures capable of Knowing, Obeying, and Submitting to His Will.

O what Potent Obligations are they then under to Serve the LORD, who tho' the Heir and Lord of all, yet became a Servant, that He might Save them? He hath Bought them with His own Precious Blood, delivered them from the Slavery of Sin and Satan. O let theſe Ranſomed of the LORD being delivered out of the hands of their Enemies, Serve their Glorious Redeemer and Saviour. For this End GOD rais'd up a Horn of Salvation in the Houſe of His Servant <hi>David,</hi> that we being delivered from the hands of our Enemies, might Serve Him without fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before Him, all the days of our Life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.69, — 74, 75.

It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a great Honour to ſtand before Princes, and to be taken into their Service: How much greater Honour is it to Serve that GOD, who is KING of Kings, and LORD of Lords? The Angels are GOD's Miniſtring Spirits, and look upon it as their higheſt Honour to bow before
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001854_0037_0FB91D01574B64E8"/>His Throne, and fulfil His Pleaſure. CHRIST aſſures us, Joh. 12.26 — <hi>If any man ſerve Me, him will my Father honour.</hi> Again, The ſervice of Sin is a cruel Bondage; the yoke of Satan is an <hi>Iron</hi> yoke. He makes His Vaſſals to ſerve with <hi>Rigour.</hi> But the Yoke of CHRIST is <hi>Eaſy,</hi> and His Commands are <hi>not Grievous.</hi> A peaceful Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of Mind is to be enjoy'd in the Service of GOD. <hi>The ways of Wiſdom are ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are Peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17.</p>
            <p>(6.) <hi>THE Service of GOD is always attended with a Glorious Recompence of Reward.</hi> They that Serve the LORD Faithfully, ſhall receive a Crown of Life and Glory, which fadeth not away; when they reſt from their Labours, they ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Maſters Joy, and be for ever with the LORD, in whoſe Preſence is fulneſs of Joy, at whoſe Right Hand are Pleaſures for Evermore. Joh. 12.26. <hi>If any man ſerve Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there ſhall alſo my Servant be.</hi> Moreover it is a great Encouragement to us to Serve the LORD, in that He is both able and willing to afford us all needful Aſſiſtance. He's always preſent with us to direct and ſtrengthen as, and help us to hold out to the End; ſo that <hi>our labour is not in vain in the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE, I. <hi>HENCE we I carn, that the Service of GOD is a moſt Reaſonable Service.</hi> Thus it is called, Rom. 12.1. — <hi>Which is your Reaſonable Service.</hi> It is thus, not only becauſe it muſt be perform'd <hi>Intelligently,</hi> in the Exerciſe of our Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Powers: But alſo becauſe there is the higheſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> for our Engaging in this Service. To Preſent our ſelves to GOD, to Conſecrate and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001854_0038_0FB91D02D66A20F0"/>Dedicate all our Powers to Him; is the moſt Reaſonable Thing in the World. It is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Prudence, a good Underſtanding have they that Serve the LORD. Such act like Men that underſtand themſelves, the Relation they ſtand in to GOD, and their own trueſt Intereſt. This is moſt juſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quitable. To alienate our ſelves from GOD our Rightful LORD and Owner; is moſt unequal, unreaſonable, and monſtrous. They that do thus, break the Rules of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Violate the moſt Sacred Bonds: They are more vile than the Beaſts that periſh; more Brutiſh than the Ox and Aſs. Remember this, and ſhew your ſelves Men, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 46.8.</p>
            <p>USE, II. <hi>LET what hath been ſaid prevail with us to Reſolve that we will Serve the LORD.</hi> Let One and All of us ſay, As for us we will Serve the LORD. And O that this Holy and Happy Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution were fixed and confirmed in each one of us! O that we might now be perſwaded, to give up our ſelves to the LORD thro' CHRIST by the SPIRIT! We can't Serve a better Maſter, a more Gracious and Bountiful LORD. Why then are we ſo backward to Bind our ſelves? Why ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give GOD His own? What! Are we unwilling? Have we the Face to ſay, that we will not be the LORD's? That we will not Serve the LORD our Maker, the LORD who is able to Deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell, the LORD who alone can make us Happy? <hi>Be aſtoniſhed O ye Heavens, and be horribly afraid</hi> at ſuch Impiety, ſuch Stupidity! GOD doth now invite you to Liſt in His Service, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth you to Preſent your ſelves unto Him. Do not then reject ſo Reaſonable a Requeſt,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001854_0039_0FB91D06CED70AB0"/>which is back'd with the Divine Authority; but now, without delay, joyn your ſelves to the LORD. We had need be ſpeedy in this Work; for we can't tell how ſoon our Day of Grace may be at an end. Let us then go to GOD this very Day, and be Earneſt with Him to take Poſſeſſion of us by His Spirit: Let us cry to Him to Sanctify us, that we may become <hi>Veſſels of honour meet for our Maſters uſe.</hi> Fall down before GOD, and Pray to Him, that for CHRIST's ſake He would receive you into His Family and Service, and keep you Faithful to Him even to the Death. If we do thus devote our ſelves to GOD, and Reſolve to be for Him and for no other; then will He advance us to the Dignity and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Children, and we ſhall become Heirs; Heirs of GOD, and Joynt-Heirs with CHRIST. I Conclude with thoſe Words, Mal. 3.16, 17. <hi>Then they that feared the LORD, ſpake often one to another, and the LORD bearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon His Name. And they ſhall be Mine, ſaith the LORD of Hoſts, in that day when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him.</hi>

            <p>WHAT are the Duties incumbent on ſuch as have the Charge of Families? How ſhould they uſe their Indeavours, that Religion and the Power of Godlineſs may be kept alive, maintained and encreaſed in their Houſes? For Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>THE Heads of Families ſhould take care to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Houſes, and to Teach them the good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tege of the LORD, His Mind &amp; Will.</hi> They ſhould look to it that their Children and Servants be taught to know the LORD, and what it is He requires of them, that ſo they may Serve Him. Without Knowlege the Heart can't be good. Men are naturally alienated from the Life of Godlineſs, by reaſon of the ignorance and blindneſs of their Hearts. If Maſters of Families would Serve the LORD themſelves, and have their Houſes joyn with them in this Excellent Service, they muſt diligently uſe the means of getting Knowlege themſelves, and ſee to it that ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Charge, be inſtructed in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Myſteries of Religion. They ſhould do what they can to teach them GOD's Statutes, and His Judgments, and take care that all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and proper helps be procured for this End. Adult Perſons can't be the Diſciples of CHRIST, and Serve GOD acceptably, unleſs they underſtand their Duty, and what the Service of the LORD is. For it is, as we have already heard, a <hi>Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> Service. More particularly,</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001854_0041_0FB91D0996F889F8"/>
(1) <hi>THE Heads of Families ſhould take care that their Children and Servants be taught to Read.</hi> The Sight is one of the Senſes of Learning and Diſcipline. We obtain a great part of our Knowledge, and Acquaintance with things, by the help of our Eyes. And therefore if they have not opportunity and leiſure themſelves to teach them to Read, they ſhould ſend them to School to be taught. It's a ſhame for Heads of Families to begrutch the Coſt and Expence which they may be at in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We ſhould take Pains with our Children and Servants, even the Meaneſt of them, and ſhould be willing to Reward the Endeavours of others for their Inſtruction. And when they have Learned to Read, we ſhould be ready to furniſh them with Bibles, and Catechiſms, and other good Books, according to their ſeveral Capacities, that they may ſee with their <hi>own</hi> Eyes the Great and Important Truths of Religion, and by Reading acquaint themſelves with them.</p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>THEY ſhould take care to Catechiſe their Children and Servants.</hi> This is a Great and Excellent Means of Inſtruction, eſpecially for Younger Perſons, and it would be both Honourable and Profitable for Perſons of Riper Years to be Exerciſed and Improved in it. Certainly then Maſters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies muſt take care that their Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Learn ſome good <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> they ſhould ſee that they commit it to Memory, and alſo endeavour to make them underſtand it, that they may know the Meaning of what they Learn, and not Anſwer meerly by Rote, and like Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots; but with Knowlege and Underſtanding. Now for this End we ſhould ſtudiouſly endeavour to ſuit
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001854_0042_0FB91D0B1647DB80"/>and accommodate our ſelves to their Capacities. There muſt be <hi>Milk</hi> for Babes, who are <hi>unſkilful in the Word of Righteouſneſs;</hi> and <hi>Meat</hi> for thoſe that are of Riper Years, and who <hi>by reaſon of uſe have their Senſes more exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil.</hi> If we would feed Children with Knowlege and Underſtanding, there muſt be <hi>Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept,</hi> here a little, and there a little. We ſhould endeavour that the tender Minds of our Young Ones may be ſeaſon'd with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of GOD, and Religion; with matter for Good and Pious Thoughts; that by the Bleſſing of GOD the Imaginations of the thoughts of their Hearts may not be Evil. The Minds of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are in a great meaſure <hi>Tabula raſa,</hi> as clean white Paper. And we ſhould uſe our Endeavours that the Laws of GOD may be written on their Hearts, and that the Truths of the Goſpel may be impreſs'd on their Minds in their Early Years. Childhood and Youth are vanity. Their Corrupt Nature makes them very prone to receive hurtful Impreſſions from the Evil Examples which they ſee ſet before them, and the Wicked Prophane Speeches they hear. O be you careful to do what you can to infuſe good Principles, the Saving and Purifying Truths of the Pure and Holy Law of GOD, as an Antidote againſt this Infection! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the Great Duties of Remembring their Creator in the Days of their Youth, of Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing His Dreadful Name, of keeping the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Holy, of Honouring and Obeying their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, of Speaking the Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to do this, that if they are Tempted to the Vices which are contrary to theſe Duties, they may be able to ſay, they have been better Taught. GOD's Ancient People were expreſsly Commanded
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001854_0043_0FB91D0C967CBE90"/>to teach their Children His Commandments: Deut. 6.6, 7. <hi>And theſe words which I command thee this day ſhall be in thine heart. And thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> Now certainly the Miſtreſſes of Families might be very Serviceable in this matter. You are very converſant with your Children, O endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be frequently inſtilling into them ſome Divine Truth; to teach them their Duty, and to preſs upon them the performance of it! I might have ſaid that as Parents ſhould be careful to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and Catechiſe their Children and Servants; ſo they ſhould alſo take Care that they attend the more Publick Opportunities of being Catechiz'd.</p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>THEY ſhould back and enforce their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions with ſolemn Warnings and Exhortations.</hi> We ſhould labour to make a cloſe application of the Truths we teach them, unto their Conſciences; that by the Grace of GOD, they may ſink deep into their Hearts, and govern their Lives. As we ſhould acquaint them with the Obligations they lye under to be the LORD's; ſo we ſhould call upon them, earneſtly to chooſe the LORD JEHOVAH for their GOD. As we ſhould Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to them the Terms of the Covenant of Grace; ſo we ſhould Exhort them to give up themſelves unto the LORD in that Covenant. As we muſt inform them of their Original Sin and Corruption; That they are by Nature <hi>Dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath;</hi> So we muſt Warn them to <hi>fly the Wrath to come,</hi> and to make haſte to <hi>lay hold of that Hope which is ſet before them.</hi> As we muſt Endeavour to Inſtruct them in the Knowlege of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001854_0044_0FB91D0F16BC1D38"/>our LORD JESUS CHRIST, His Perſon, and Offices: So we ſhould call upon them to receive CHRIST as offer'd to them in the Goſpel. Thus we ſhould Inſtruct, Exhort, and Warn thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Care. And here let us remember, and ſeriouſly Conſider, That thoſe Servants who are in the loweſt degree of Servitude, muſt not be neglected; They have Immortal Souls to Save or Loſe, as well as others; They have the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Wants and Diſeaſes, which others naturally labour of. And they are capable of being made <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto GOD,</hi> as well as others; and of becoming the adopted Children of GOD by Faith in CHRIST. <hi>Of a truth GOD is no Reſpecter of Perſons; but in every Nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteouſneſs is accepted with Him,</hi> Act. 10.34, 35. And thus we have Conſider'd the firſt Particular, That the Heads of Families muſt take care to Teach their Houſes the Knowledge of GOD, His Mind and Will. It's true, it's not in our power to give them Grace, GOD alone is able to ſhine into their hearts with the light of the glorious Goſpel in the face of JESUS CHRIST, ſo as <hi>to turn them from darkneſs unto light; and from the power of Satan unto GOD.</hi> However, we are oblig'd to wait upon GOD in the uſe of theſe Means, if we would Serve GOD with our Houſes.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>THE Heads of Families muſt take care that the Worſhip of GOD be kept up, and maintain'd in them.</hi> This they muſt do, if they would Serve the LORD in conjunction with their Houſes. In this way they muſt uſe their Endeavours that their Houſes may be <hi>Bethels,</hi> Houſes of GOD, Houſes devoted to His more immediate Service; That they be Temples Conſecrated to the Worſhip of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001854_0045_0FB91D10594E0ED0"/>GOD. Every Family is a diſtinct Society, and as ſuch, they ought to Worſhip GOD together, and the Heads of Families ſhould lead herein.</p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>IT is their Duty to Pray with their Families.</hi> They ſhould offer up the Sacrifice of <hi>Prayer</hi> to GOD in their Families Morning and Evening. Their Prayer ſhould be Set before the LORD <hi>as Incenſe, and the lifting up of their hands as the Evening Sacrifice,</hi> agreeable to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. Our Houſes muſt be Houſes of <hi>Prayer,</hi> or we can't Serve GOD acceptably in them. This is one thing implyed in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Reſolution, that he would Worſhip GOD in his Family by <hi>Prayer,</hi> and that they ſhould offer up their united Requeſts and Petitions at the Throne of Grace. The Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>David</hi>'s bleſſing his Houſhold, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20. It is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>He bleſſed the People in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> And, v. 20. <hi>Then David returned to bleſs his Houſhold.</hi> Men <hi>bleſs</hi> others, by <hi>Praying</hi> for GOD's Bleſſing upon them. And thus, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, <hi>David</hi> bleſſed his Family, by <hi>Praying</hi> with, and for them. In the Morning and Infancy of the Church, Families were Churches; ſuch was <hi>Adam</hi>'s, ſuch <hi>Noah</hi>'s. There are Family-Wants; and therefore Maſters of Families ſhould together with their Houſes, make known their Requeſts to GOD, for the Supply of them: There are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Duties to be performed; and therefore they ſhould join together with their Houſes in Praying to GOD for Strength and Grace to do them Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, to Diſcharge them to His Glory, and their own Comfort. They receive many Family-Mercies, and therefore it becomes them to join together in Bleſſing and Praiſing that GOD who is the Author of all our Mercies, <hi>the Father of Lights,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001854_0046_0FB91D11D63351B0"/>from whom cometh down every good and perfect giving.</hi> Furthermore, there are many Family-Sins, which ſhould be Confeſs'd and Bewail'd; certainly then, it is the Duty of the Heads of Families to make known their Requeſts unto GOD, <hi>by Prayer and Supplication, with Thankſgiving.</hi> They muſt attend upon this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Daily, engage in it with great Seriouſneſs. They muſt look to it, that thoſe who are under their Care and Inſpection, give due Attendance at the Times for Prayer; and chooſe the moſt Convenient Seaſons for the Diſcharge of this Duty. They ſhould ſtudy ſo to order their Secular Affairs, that they may not interfere with, or crowd out this neceſſary Duty, but that they may have due and ſuitable Time for the Diſcharge of it. Fervent Prayer is an Excellent Mean to keep true Piety Alive and Flouriſhing; and it is a conſiderable and eſſential Part of that Homage which we owe to the Bleſſed GOD. And therefore, if this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be neglected, we do not Serve the LORD with our Houſes as we are bound to do.</p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>THEY ſhould Read the Scriptures with their Families.</hi> As we muſt <hi>Speak</hi> to GOD and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly call upon Him by Prayer, ſo we ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively <hi>Hear</hi> what GOD the LORD hath to ſay unto us. It's therefore very Proper to join with Prayer the Reading a Portion of the Word of GOD in the Family. This is a Part of Divine Worſhip, and it ought to be a Part of our Daily Worſhip in our Houſes. We read, 2 Tim. 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of GOD, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs.</hi> We have in theſe Oracles of GOD the Rules laid down according to which we muſt Walk, if we would
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001854_0047_0FB91D13563EE2A0"/>have our Ways pleaſe the LORD, and Serve Him Acceptably. Here we are Taught what our Duty is, and to whom we muſt go for Strength to Perform it. I might here ſay, that if ſome Practical Expoſition were made uſe of, it would be of good Advantage.</p>
            <p>TO theſe Particulars it might be added, That the <hi>Singing of Pſalms</hi> is a Pleaſant and Profitable Exerciſe, which ſhould be attended, where there's Ability to Perform it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here take occaſion to ſay that the Heads of Families ſhould Worſhip GOD in Secret; and they muſt call upon all under their Care to do ſo too, and allow them convenient time for Secret Duties. Each Member of the Family come to years of Diſcretion, muſt Worſhip GOD apart, as well as in conjunction with the Family. Our Saviour commands, Mat. 6.6. <hi>But thou when thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret,</hi> — It ſhould be their care that ſuch as are well-diſpoſed in their Families, may not have juſt reaſon to complain that they are not allow'd time to Pray, and Read the Word of GOD in Secret. Our Servants are not ſo <hi>ours,</hi> but they are the LORD's ſtill, and GOD expects that part of their time be daily devoted to His more immediate Service; ſo that if we refuſe to grant convenient time for ſuch Duties, we rob GOD of His due.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>HEADS of Families ſhould take care that their Families do Sanctify the LORD's-Day, and keep it Holy.</hi> If they would have their Families Serve the LORD, they muſt do ſo. In the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001854_0048_0FB91D14D86BCCF0"/>it is expreſly ſaid, Exod. 20.10. <hi>Thou ſhalt not do any work, thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thy man-ſervant, nor thy maid-ſervant, nor thy cattel, nor thy ſtranger that is within thy gates.</hi> Maſters of Families ſhould ſee to it, that their Children and Servants Reſt from their Worldly buſineſs, and Employment, on the LORD's-Day, and ſpend that Time in the Publick and Private Exerciſes of GOD's Worſhip; except ſo much as is to be taken up in the works of Neceſſity, and Mercy. They ſhould ſee to it that their Houſes be ſet in Order, and that their Secular and Worldly Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs be Seaſonably laid aſide; that ſo they and their Houſes may keep the Sabbath as a Day of Holy <hi>Reſt</hi> unto the LORD. Thus they muſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> the Sabbath Day, to keep it Holy. Very Solemn are the Precepts and Exhortations recorded, Jer. 17.20, 21, 22. <hi>Hear ye the word of the LORD, — Thus ſaith the LORD, Take heed to your ſelves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath-Day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jeruſalem. Neither carry forth a burden out of your houſes on the Sabbath-Day, neither do ye any work; but hallow ye the Sabbath-Day.</hi> They muſt ſee that they do not <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Allow</hi> their Servants to <hi>Work</hi> on the LORD's-Day. And it is their Duty alſo to uſe their Authority to Reſtrain them from <hi>Play</hi> and vanity; yea, from ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations</hi> as may be Lawful on other days. The governours of Families ſhould take care that they with their Houſes attend upon the Publick Worſhip of GOD on the LORD's-Day. As they ſhould take care that they attend the Duties of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Worſhip in the Family: ſo they ſhould provide that none under their Roof do needleſly abſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Houſe of GOD, and forfake the Aſſembling of themſelves together to Worſhip
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001854_0049_0FB91D16F26A4000"/>GOD with the Congregation of His People. If Heads of Families allow their Children or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to tarry at home, when they ought to go to the Publick Aſſembly; they do not do what in them lyes to make their Houſholds Serve the LORD. It is Scandalous for Children or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be ſuffered to abſent themſelves from the Publick Worſhip of GOD, when Neceſſity doth not require it. And if ſuch as have the Charge of Families would take up Joſhua's Reſolution, they muſt exert their Authority to oblige them to wait upon GOD in His Houſe, and ſee that their behaviour there be decent and reverent; and not profane and ludicrous.</p>
            <p>USE. <hi>THOSE of us that are Maſters of Families have cauſe to be Humbled for our Defects and Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comings in this great Duty; that we have been no more careful to engage our Houſholds in Serving the LORD.</hi> Who of us can ſay that we have not been wanting in this Matter? In many things all of us have offended, and fallen ſhort of our Duty. We have not been ſo careful to walk in our Houſes with a perfect Heart as we ought to have been; to dwell with our Families as Men of Knowlege. Our Lips have not preſerved Knowledge, and communicated it ſo much as they ought to have done. We have not been ſo fervent and frequent in our Exhortations and Warnings as we ought to have been. And muſt we not confeſs that we have been remiſs in maintaining Family-Worſhip, in the Life and Power of it. Alas, have we not been Formal and Indifferent in Praying in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and Reading the Word of GOD to them? Have we not been negligent in our Obſervation of the LORD's-Day? Have not the Cares, and

               </gap> out Family-Religion? Certainly, the beſt of us have reaſon to be humbled before the LORD upon this Account, and to ſay as, Pſal. 130.3. <hi>If thou LORD ſhouldſt mark iniquities; O LORD, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> Let us then lye down in the Duſt, and abaſe our ſelves before the LORD for our Family-Sins. Let us Cry to Him to Sprinkle our Houſes with the Blood of the True Paſcal Lamb, which taketh away the Sin of the World.</p>
            <p>AND let us now be Exhorted to be active and diligent in Reforming what has been amiſs; and to be more zealous in promoting the Exerciſe of Family-Religion for the future. Let us now Renew and Strengthen this holy Reſolution, <hi>As for us, and our houſes, We will Serve the LORD.</hi> Let us reſolve with <hi>David</hi> in that Pſalm, which as one obſerves, may be called the Houſholder's Pſalm, 101.2. <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way; O when wilt thou come unto me?

O let it be our Care that they may be Fed, not only with <hi>Bread,</hi> but alſo with Spiritual <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding.

Let us take care to offer up fervent Prayers for, and with our Families. Let our houſes be more than ever Houſes of Prayer.

Yet I ſay, It's moſt certain that GOD doth inveſt them with power and authority over their Families by an immutable, and unchangable Law: The Fifth Commandment expreſsly ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> Children are Commanded to Obey their Parents; Servants, their Maſters: Eph. 6.1, &amp; 5. <hi>Children Obey your Parents in the Lord; for this is right.</hi> 5. v. <hi>Servants, be obedient to them that are your Maſters according to the fleſh, with fear and trembling, in ſingleneſs of your heart, as unto Chriſt.</hi> The light and law of Nature taught the Heathen, that every <hi>Man ſhould hear Rule in his own Houſe.</hi> Now ſeeing GOD hath clothed Heads of Families with Power, they ought to improve their Power for the countenancing, and encouraging Religion and the Fear of GOD in their Houſes. For as they derive their Authority from GOD; ſo they ſhould employ it to His Honour and Glory. They ſhould in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <hi>be a Terror to evil doers, and a Praiſe to them that do well.</hi> Thus they ought to back and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their Inſtructions and Exhortations, by their Authority; and ſee that they maintain Family-Diſcipline in their Houſes. GOD gives that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Character and Encomium of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Gen. 18.19. <hi>For I know him, that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the LORD, to do Justice and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He hath ſpoken of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY ſhould not only <hi>Teach</hi> and Inſtruct; but alſo <hi>Command</hi> their Houſhold to Serve the LORD, as being Perſons in Authority. Maſters of Families ſhould Charge thoſe under their Care, their Children and Servants to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.

To abſtain from Play, and Idleneſs on the Lords Day. To Keep good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Family, by duely attending on Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Worſhip. They ſhould alſo Command them to avoid Vicious and Profane Company, and to keep themſelves from ſuch Places where there is danger of their being corrupted in their Manners. We ſhould as there is need of it, Command them to beware of every thing that hath a Tendency to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch them. Maſters of Families ſhould uſe their endeavours, that Evil Cuſtoms may not get Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and prevail among us.

And therefore Maſters of Families when they ſee their Children or Servants Tempted to Sin, and in Danger of running into any Exceſs; They ſhould lay their Commands upon them to keep themſelves from the accurſed thing, which GOD's Soul hateth, and their Souls ſhould abhor. When they ſee them in Danger, they ſhould Authoritatively declare to them, that ſuch and ſuch things as are contrary to the Mind and Will of GOD, are alſo diſpleaſing to them; and that if they do them, it muſt be upon their Peril.</p>

AGAIN, Heads of Families ſhould uſe their Authority to Reprove their Children and Servants for their Sins and Follies, and to Correct them, if need be. As they ought to Command them to abſtain from Sin; ſo alſo to Reprove and Correct them for their Sins, as need requires. They have power to affix a Penalty as a Sanction to their Commands, and to put it in Execution, in caſe of Diſobedience. In this way they ought to bear their Teſtimony againſt the iniquities of their Children and Servants, as the matter may require. <hi>Eli</hi> is articled againſt in the Word of GOD, and threatned for his negligence herein, 1 Sam. 3.13. <hi>For I have told him, that I will judge his Houſe for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: becauſe his ſons made themſelves vile, and he restrained them not.</hi> Heads of Families don't do what in them lies to reſtrain and ſuppreſs Vice in their Houſes, if they are not careful to Chaſtiſe and Puniſh their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants when found guilty. Its their Duty in this way to improve their Power for that GOD who hath given it them; and ſo to <hi>put away iniquity far from their Tabernacles.</hi> They muſt have no Fellowſhip with any unfruitful work of Darkneſs, which they ſee any in their Families chargeable with: but ſhould Diſcountenance it, Reprove it, Frown upon it; that ſo if they have any that will not be ſubject to the Laws of GOD for Conſcience ſake, and a holy Fear of His Wrath; that yet they may by the Bleſſing of GOD, be reſtrained from the Open Violation of His Laws, for fear of preſent Puniſhment: Prov. 13.24. <hi>He that ſpareth his rod, hateth his ſon: but he that loveth him, chaſtneth him betimes.</hi> It's true, Heads of Families ſhould beware of abuſing their power; they ſhould take heed to themſelves that

            <p>AND then, as it is the Duty of Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to uſe their Power to diſcountenance Vice; ſo alſo to encourage Virtue and true Piety in their Families. They muſt be a <hi>Praiſe</hi> and Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them that do well; as well as a <hi>Terror</hi> to evil doers. Such as are Heads of Families ſhould improve their Influence and Authority to countenance their Children and Servants, and all under their Roof in that which is Pious and Honeſt, and of good Report. <hi>GOD's Countenance beholds the Upright</hi> with delight and complacency; And they muſt be imitators of GOD herein; they ſhould give ſuch as fear the LORD, ſome peculiar marks and teſtimonies of their Favour: and ſhew them, that they are well pleaſed to ſee them take care to Serve GOD, and to walk worthy of the LORD. As they ſhould endeavour to help ſuch forward in the Service of GOD, by their Inſtructions; ſo alſo to uſe their Authority to protect and ſtrengthen them in the Service of our common LORD; and not ſuffer any <hi>to harm them,</hi> to reproach or ſcoff at them, <hi>becauſe they are followers of that which is good.</hi> Thus if Heads of Families would Serve the LORD with their Houſes, they muſt uſe the Authority GOD hath given them, to incourage true Piety; and to ſuppreſs Vice; That ſo by the bleſſing of GOD, their Houſes may be the Habitations of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that wickedneſs may not dwell with them.</p>

            <p>ITS the Duty of Heads of Families to look to it that all under their care be employed in ſome <hi>Buſineſs;</hi> and that they be not ſuffered to ſpend their time in Idleneſs and Vanity. We muſt not let them be all the Day Idle: For <hi>Idleneſs</hi> is in it ſelf a great Sin, and is the cauſe of many other ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. When Perſons are Idle, Satan will find work for them to do. Certainly then, If we would Serve the LORD with our Houſes, we muſt ſee that ours be employ'd in ſome Buſineſs, according to their ſeveral Capacities.</p>
            <p>AND then we ſhould ſee that their Buſineſs be <hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Lawful.</hi> We muſt beware that we do not ſeek a Maintenance for our Selves, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies by unjuſt Practices.

               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:001854_0065_0FB91D315690F658"/>
               <hi>Behold, I will do a thing in Iſrael, at which both the Ears of every one that heareth it ſhall tingle. In that day, I will perform againſt Eli, all things which I have ſpoken concerning his Houſe: when I begin I will alſo make an end. For I have told him, that I will judge his Houſe for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not. And therefore I have Sworn unto the Houſe of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's Houſe ſhall not be purged with Sacrifice nor Offering for ever.</hi> If Maſters do not take care to keep up the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD in their Houſes; to command their Children and Servants to keep GOD's Statutes; they may expect that the Curſe of GOD will enter into their Houſes, and ſooner or later, conſume them and their Families. We read of <hi>a Flying Roll,</hi> Zech. 5.1. And then its ſaid, <hi>This is the Curſe that goeth forth over the face of the whole Earth,</hi> ver. 3, 4. <hi>I will bring it forth, ſaith the LORD of Hoſts, and it ſhall enter into the Houſe of the Thief, and into the Houſe of him that Sweareth falſely by my Name: and it ſhall remain in the midſt of his Houſe, and ſhall conſume it, with the Timber thereof, and the Stones thereof.</hi> Now we rob GOD of His due all the while we take no care to Serve the LORD our ſelves, and to uſe our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that our Houſes may joyn with us in Serving the LORD. If we neglect to maintain the Worſhip of GOD in our Houſes, we rob Him of the Offerings of Prayer and Praiſe, which are His due. We rob Him of His Glory while we indulge abominable Iniquities in our Houſes. Now this is the way to have the Curſe of GOD ſpoken of in this Text, lie upon us, and upon ours. Such as live like Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in their Houſes, have reaſon to fear that
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001854_0066_0FB91D32D6612810"/>Curſe ſhould fall upon them, Pſal. 79.6. <hi>Pour out thy wrath upon the Heathen that have not know thee, and upon the Kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name.</hi> Sometimes the Houſes <hi>of the wicked are ſafe from fear, neither is the rod of GOD upon them,</hi> Job 21.9. They are carnally ſecure, and proſper upon Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Accounts. But then this is one of the moſt dreadful Judgments, to be ſuffered to go on in Sin without the Checks and Reſtraints of GOD's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Spiritual Plagues are the worſt of Plagues. Certainly then the Maſters of Families are oblig'd to uſe their endeavours that their Houſes may Serve the LORD, as they would hope to preſerve them from the blaſting Curſe of a Jealous GOD. And then if Maſters are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in their Duty, and do not bear Teſtimony againſt Sin in their Families; they will pull down an heavy load of Guilt on themſelves, and day themſelves open to the Righteous Diſpleaſure and Fiery Indignation of GOD. If our Children or Servants periſh through our Criminal negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; if we take no care for their Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs; their Blood will be required at our Hands. And if we die without Repentance they will riſe up in Judgment againſt us, in the Great and Terrible Day of the LORD, when we and they muſt ſtand before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST to give an account of the things done in the body, and to receive our final Sentence. And O how terrible will it be to have our Children accuſe us then, and ſay, You were cruel to our Immortal Souls, and never had any true regard to our Spiritual Welfare: You were more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to teach us the vain Faſhions, and evil Cuſtoms of the World; Than to inſtruct us in the Principles of Religion, and to uſe your endeavours that we
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001854_0067_0FB91D3457AF1858"/>might be brought to the Saving knowledge of GOD in CHRIST: You were more Solicitous to have us adorned with thoſe accompliſhments which might recommend us to the eſteem of the World; Than to have us adorned with the Graces of the Spirit, and with the Beauties and Glories of the inward Man; you allowed us to Serve divers Luſts and Pleaſures; but never call'd upon us Seriouſly, to Serve the LORD our Maker. You were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to get Eſtates for us, and that we ſhould make a figure in the World; Than to obtain the Bleſſings of the New Covenant for us. O how ſhall we be able to lift up our heads at the Great Day, If our Children ſhould accuſe us after this manner! Alas! We ſhall not be able to ſtand in the Judgment, but ſhall call to the Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall on us, and hide us from the wrath of GOD and the Lamb. Certainly then, it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily concerns Heads of Families to give diligence that their Children and Servants, and all under their Care may be brought to Acknowlege GOD as their GOD, and to Serve Him. We muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by the Grace of GOD, to do our duty in this Matter, as we would hope to give up our account with joy, and not with grief.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>THIS is the way to obtain the gracious Preſence of GOD with us in our Houſes, and to have His Bleſſing upon us.</hi> If we take Care to Serve GOD in our Houſes, then He will come down and be in the midſt of us, to bleſs us. If we in this way open the doors of our Houſes, and give the bleſſed GOD admittance? He will come in, and make His Abode with us. <hi>Lift up your heads O ye Gates, and be ye lift up ye everlaſting doors, and the King of Glory ſhall come in.</hi> CHRIST doth as it were knock

Should not Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies make all needful Preparation for His Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, by Purging their Houſes from Sin, and by maintaining the Worſhip of GOD in them. The Preſence of the Glorious GOD will be an abundant Recompence for all the care and pains we can take to receive and entertain Him. We read, Rev. 22.12. <hi>And behold, I come quckly; and my Reward is with me.</hi> — This is true with reſpect to CHRIST's approaches to His People in this Life, when He manifeſts His Gracious Preſence with them, and paſſeth before them in acts of eſpecial Kindneſs and Favour. When He comes into our Hearts, or into our Houſes to dwell with us: He will not come empty-handed; No, But He will bring Spiritual and Heavenly Bleſſings with Him; The Bleſſings of the Upper and the Nether Springs. If we and our Houſes Serve the LORD, then will GOD Bleſs us, Delight in us, and Rejoyce over us to do us good. Prov. 3.33. <hi>The Curſe of the LORD is in the houſe of the wicked: but he bleſſeth the habitation of the juſt.</hi> Now its the Bleſſing of GOD that Buildeth the Houſe, that Eſtabliſheth it, that Enricheth it. O how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, how joyfully might we live, had we more of the Preſence of GOD with us, and more of the Divine Bleſſing upon us? They will have light in their Dwellings, who have the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> dwelling with them. They ſhall ſee the want of no good thing, of nothing which Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Wiſdom ſhall ſee needful and proper for them, who receive GOD into their Hearts and Houſes; That GOD, <hi>from whom cometh down every good and perfect giving.</hi> O how comfortable, how deſirable is it, to have that GOD keep Houſe with us,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001854_0069_0FB91D375700C758"/>who is the GOD of Peace, the GOD of Order, the GOD of Love? This would ſweeten the Troubles we meet with in the Fleſh; leſſen and lighten the Burthens and Difficulties of our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome Pilgrimage. GOD will protect and defend ſuch Houſes; and the ſecret of His Preſence ſhall be as a Pavilion to them. Pſal. 91.10. <hi>There ſhall no Evil befal thee, neither ſhall any Plague come nigh thy Dwelling.</hi> Nothing but what GOD will Over-rule for good; they ſhall have Health in their Habitations, if GOD ſeeth it beſt. However He will viſit ſuch as Serve Him, when in Sickneſs, and make their Beds for them in the time of their Languiſhing. He will Crown them with His Favour, and Command a Bleſſing on their Outward Enjoyments. 2 Sam. 6.11, 12. <hi>And the Ark of the Lord continued in the Houſe of Obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doth GOD <hi>preſerve our going out, and coming in,</hi> in the Day Time, when Man goeth forth to his Labour? Doth He make our Buſineſs to Proſper?

And though it be not required that we ſhould be very long in Craving a Bleſſing, or Returning Thanks; yet certainly it becomes us to do it with Reverence and with hearts devoutly affected with the Mercies of GOD; and not with a trifling Air, as if we were Praying to, or Bleſſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="5">
               <hi>THIS is the beſt way you can take to keep up and maintain your Authority in your Families.</hi> Thus to Honour GOD by Serving Him in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, is the beſt way to ſecure to your ſelves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Obedience. If your Children and Servants ſee that you improve your Power for GOD; this will probably beget in them reverence and eſteem. If Maſters of Families are careful to Command their Houſhold to fear the LORD, and keep His Commandments; This will give Force and Authority to thoſe Commands which more immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect themſelves: For the Law of GOD doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Children to obey their Parents; Servants, their Maſters. The Word of GOD ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth Relative Duties as a Vital and Eſſential Part of pure Religion. And therefore the more we promote true Religion in our Houſes; the more this flouriſheth and grows: By ſo much the more will Heads of Families he likely to Maintain their Authority, and to receive thoſe acknowledgements, that Duty &amp; Obedience in their Houſes, which is owing to them. Their Piety will give them an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory. There's a Majeſty in
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001854_0072_0FB91D3D66EEDBA0"/>true Piety which commands Reſpect. But if Maſters and Miſtreſſes are Vicious and Profane themſelves, and take no care to promote the Service of GOD in their Families; they may expect to be lightly eſteemed. If they do thus diſhonour GOD, He may be provok'd to <hi>pour Contempt</hi> upon them, and to lay their honour in the duſt. 1 Sam. 2.30 — <hi>Them that honour Me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe Me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> How often hath the Authority and Government of Heads of Families been forfeited and loſt by not being improv'd for the Glory and Honour of GOD? And that Threatning hath been fulfilled. Iſai. 24.2. <hi>And it ſhall be — as with the Servant, ſo with his Maſter; as with the Maid, ſo with her Mistreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>TO promote Religion and the Service of GOD in our Families, will be most Comfortable and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for Us and Ours.</hi> Heads of Families can't take a better courſe to promote the trueſt welfare of their Houſes, than by taking Care to Serve the LORD in them. This will be both pleaſant and profitable: For the more there is of Religion in the Family, the more comfort we ſhall be likely to have in our ſeveral Relations. The Word of GOD teacheth us how to diſcharge the Duties of our ſeveral Relations; and that's neceſſary in order to our Enjoying true Comfort in them.</p>
            <p>THE more there is of true Religion in a Family, The more there will be of true Comfort and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the <hi>Conjugal Relation.</hi> If Husbands and Wives <hi>walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Law blameleſs,</hi> there will be a Mutual love and endearment between them; and the Commands of GOD reſpecting their Mutual Duties will not be grievous; but eaſy, pleaſant, and delightful, as far as the Grace of GOD governs them. The more
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001854_0073_0FB91D3F9793DF98"/>they <hi>dwell as heirs together of the Grace of Life;</hi> the more true Satisfaction will they enjoy: This will ſweeten to them the Troubles they meet with, and make their burthens lighter, while each one doth his part, and bears his part, <hi>forbearing one another in love,</hi> in Obedience to GOD's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, The more careful Heads of Families are to Serve the LORD with their Houſes, The more Comfort they will be likely to have in their <hi>Children.</hi> If we teach our Children the good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the LORD, and uſe our utmoſt endeavours that they may be made <hi>Wiſe to Salvation;</hi> then we may hope to have joy in them in this Life, and that which is to come. <hi>A wiſe Son maketh a glad Father,</hi> Prov. 15.20. The Love of Parents to their Children is a very Conſtant, and a very ſtrong Paſſion. How greatly then muſt they rejoyce (if they underſtand their own intereſt, and the intereſt of their Children) <hi>To ſee their Children walking in the Truth.</hi> What a Satisfaction muſt it be to them to behold the Image of GOD ſhining in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren! And how great Bleſſings and Comforts will ſuch Children be to their Parents! The more they fear GOD, and keep His Commandments; the more dutiful, the more helpful will they be; the more will they be the Staff and Solace of their Age. On the other hand, <hi>A fooliſh Son</hi> (and wickedneſs is the worſt Folly) <hi>is a grief to his Father, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs to her that bare him,</hi> Prov. 17 25. The more your Children love GOD, the more they obey His Commands; the more will they love one another, the cloſer will their Union be, which is their ſtrength and glory. How pleaſant is it both for Parents and Children, when they dwell together in Unity: Pſal. 133.1, 2. <hi>Behold, how good and how pleaſant it is, for
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001854_0074_0FB91D4116810068"/>Brethren to dwell together in Unity. It's like the precious oyntment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aarons beard, that went down to the ſkirts of his garments.</hi> Like a ſweet perfume, it will afford delight, and chear the Spirits. Great Eſtates and. Poſſeſſions will not make your Children happy; No, No, If they have not the ſaving knowledge of GOD in CHRIST; If they do not chooſe GOD for their Portion: their Worldly enjoyments will be fuel for their Luſts; They will prove Snares and Temptations to them, eſtrange them from GOD, and ſo ſet them at a greater diſtance from true Bleſſedneſs; and plunge them into the deeper abyſs of Miſery.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, The more Careful they are in this kind, the more likely will Maſters of Families be to enjoy Comfort in <hi>their Servants.</hi> If our Servants become the Faithful Servants of GOD; they will then be Faithful and Diligent in Serving <hi>us.</hi> If Servants Fear the <hi>LORD,</hi> they will be Obedient to their <hi>Maſters; Not with Eye-ſervice as Men-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, but as the Servants of Chriſt, doing the will of GOD from the Heart.</hi> Were Maſters more careful to Teach their Servants to know the LORD, as well as to underſtand their Particular Trade; they would probably, not have ſo much reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Unfaithful diſobedient Servants, as now they have. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Philemon</hi> concerning his Servant <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in his bonds, ſays, Philemon 10, 11. verſes. <hi>I beſeech thee for my Son Oneſimus whom I have begotten in my bonds: which in time paſt was to thee unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but now profitable to thee, and to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as Religion will be comfortable and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the Heads of Families, and their Houſes, In that it obligeth every One to the Duty of their
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001854_0075_0FB91D429646CA10"/>reſpective Relations, and ſo tends to keep Peace in the Family, and to make the Members of it mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bleſſings each to other <hi>while they live together:</hi> So alſo it wou'd afford ſtrong conſolation to Maſters <hi>when the Relation between them and their Families, or any parts of them, ſhall be diſſolved.</hi> We are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Change, and many are the Changes which paſs over us in this paſſing World. And in a little time Death will break the Bands whereby we are united, and Diſſolve the Relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husbands and their Wives; Parents and their Children; Maſters and their Servants. Now in hours of ſuch Changes, it will be very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, if we can look back, and ſay, While we Lived together we took care to Serve the LORD together. This will be Comfortable to us, when our Children or Servants do remove from us, and become the Heads of diſtinct Families: This will be Comfortable to us, when our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Servants ſhall be taken from us by Death. It is no new and uncommon thing for Parents that live to Old Age, to ſurvive their Children. And they have the Sorrow many times of Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children that are grown up. Now it will afford them Light and Comfort in ſuch a dark Hour, if they can ſay that they Devoted ſuch Children unto GOD; That they Pray'd for them, and Pray'd with them; that they Educated them for GOD. This will be a Comfort to them when GOD calls for His Children which were given, or rather lent unto them. This will alſo be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to us when <hi>our own time to Die</hi> ſhall Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; when the Hour ſhall draw nigh, in which we muſt be carried out of our Houſes, to the ſilent Grave. O how Comfortable will it be, if, when the Voice of GOD's Providence ſays to us, as
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001854_0076_0FB91D451F35A790"/>2 King. 20.1. <hi>Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, and not live.</hi> I ſay, If then we can Appeal to GOD as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> v. 3. <hi>I beſeech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> This will ſtrengthen our Hearts when we come to bid an Eternal Farewel to our Houſes; and the Places which now know us, ſhall know us no more. If we Serve GOD with our Houſes in Sincerity, then we may in a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hour Bleſs them in the Name of the LORD, with a well grounded hope that the Eternal JEHOVAH will continue to Dwell in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and delight to Bleſs them, when we are gathered to our Fathers. Then we may commit our near Relations unto GOD with an humble Confidence that He who is the EVERLASTING FATHER, will be <hi>the Father of our Fatherleſs Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the Husband of our Widows.</hi> Then we may leave our Children with GOD, hoping in Him that <hi>He will take them up,</hi> and take a Fatherly Care of them, when we are Dead and gone. If we can ſay, While we were with them in the World, we us'd our endeavours to keep them in the Fear and Service of GOD: we may then Pray in Faith that GOD would preſerve them from <hi>the Evils,</hi> when we are not. In a Word, Thus to Serve GOD with our Houſes, will be very Comfortable to us at the Great Day, when our Judge ſhall Demand of us, What have you done with, What have you done for your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants which I gave you? O what Divine Pleaſure and Satisfaction will it be, if we ſo Serve GOD here with our Houſes, that we may come to Rejoyce together in the Day of CHRIST's Appearing. What a joyous Crown of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001854_0077_0FB91D465638E378"/>Glory will our Children be to us, if we ſhall be able in that Day to ſay, <hi>Lo here we are, and the Children Thou haſt given us!</hi> But whatever the Event be; yet if we by the Grace of GOD, do our Duty in Sincerity, we ſhall give up our Account with Joy.</p>
            <p>TO Conclude, Let us conſider the many Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations we are under, to Serve the LORD with our Houſes; how much it is both our Intereſt and Duty ſo to do. And then, reſolve by the Help of GOD, That <hi>as for us and our Houſes, we will Serve the Lord.</hi> Let us conſider Seriouſly, that the Care and Charge of Families, is in a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar manner committed to the Heads of them. O let us not then dare to Betray this Truſt! Wo to us if we do. Let us awfully conſider, that if we take no Care to Serve the LORD with our Houſes, the Iniquity of our Houſes will be laid to our Charge (as we have heard) and we, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, ſhall be expos'd to the Wrath and Curſe of GOD. O that this Conſideration might awaken us to Serve the Lord with <hi>Reverence and Godly Fear,</hi> in our Houſes. O that we might be effectually perſwaded by the Terrors of the LORD, to Serve GOD our ſelves, and to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Children and Servants to join with us in this Excellent Service; to Warn and to Reprove them for their Sins, and uſe our Endeavours to Reclaim them, that ſo their Blood may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at our Hands, in the Great Day of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Let us Remember, that this is the way to engage the Preſence of GOD with us, and to obtain His Bleſſing. And let Love to our ſelves, and our Children, quicken us in this way to ſeek after the Preſence and Bleſſing of GOD, without
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001854_0078_0FB91D4A165529C0"/>which our outward Enjoyments will be turned into Curſes. Have we any regular Self-Love? Have we any true Affection to our Families? Have we any Bowels of Compaſſion Yearning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Children, which are our ſelves multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied? O then, let us ſhow and manifeſt our Love, by uſing our utmoſt Endeavours to ſecure the Preſence and Bleſſing of God, with our ſelves; with our Wives, who are our ſelves; with our Children; with our Servants. This will be the beſt and moſt evident Teſtimony of our hearty Love to them.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Let us conſider how Comfortable and Profitable it will be for us, and our Houſes to Serve the LORD. And let us now ſeek after Comfort in our ſeveral Relations in this way. It may be we have been Extravagant in our Expectations, too ready to promiſe our ſelves great Pleaſure and Satisfaction other ways, and upon other Accounts; but have been Diſappointed (as Men generally are, when their Expectations from the Creature are Carnal and Senſual) and have found little elſe but Vanity, and Vexation of Spirit. Let us then Reflect on our Folly, and Repent of it. And now let us ſeek for Comfort, by Serving GOD our ſelves, and by taking care to Engage our Relations to join with us in Serving the LORD. In this we ſhall find ſolid Pleaſure, durable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. If we join together Heartily in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the LORD; we ſhall then have real Joy in our Relations, ſuch Joy as Death it ſelf ſhall not be able to Bereave us of. And now, <hi>O that we were Wiſe, and underſtood this;</hi> that we could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider where our true Intereſt lies, and the Intereſt of our Families; that it might be well with us and ours for Ever.</p>

               </gap>o Poſterity. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then Heads of Families are ſtrongly oblig'd to teach their Children and Servants GOD's Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and His Judgments, and to Call upon them earneſtly to Serve the LORD. This is the way to have our Children made the Bleſſings and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Places where they dwell; and have them ſtand up for GOD, and maintain His Worſhip when we are dead and laid in our Graves. Whereas if Family-Inſtruction be neglected, if Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Diſcipline be not kept up, and that with a peculiar regard to the advancement of true Piety, and for the diſcountenancing of Vice: We ſhall have dreadful reaſon to fear that there will ariſe a Generation not knowing the LORD, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Obey His Commandments. Undoubtedly then, Heads of Families are under Indiſpenſible Obligations to Inſtruct their Children, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to Serve the LORD. For in this way they will do excellent Service to the Publick, and lend a helping hand towards the building of GOD's Temple among us. If we would hope to have our Churches grow and encreaſe with the Increaſings of GOD; we muſt keep up Family Religion, that ſo our Houſes may be Nurſeries of true Piety, wherein our Young Ones may grow up, thrive and flouriſh; and as they grow in Stature, increaſe in true Wiſdom and Knowledge; that they may when grown up to Maturity; be as Trees of Righteouſneſs Planted <hi>in the Courts of our GOD,</hi> that bring forth their fruit in due Seaſon. And indeed, Heads of Families are in a peculiar manner oblig'd to this Duty from the Privileges which they and their Children are admitted to in the Churches of CHRIST. Our Children are
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001854_0081_0FB91D50D65E68F0"/>generally Baptiſed. Now when Parents do enter into Covenant with GOD, and when they offer their Children to GOD in Baptiſm, they bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under engagements to bring up their Children <hi>in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD;</hi> to Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them for that GOD whoſe Name is call'd upon them, and to whom they are devoted when they receive this initiating Seal of the Covenant. When therefore we neglect this Duty, we are guilty of lying to the LORD, and are Perjured in His Covenant. O that we were awaken'd to conſider the Vows of the LORD which are upon us, more Seriouſly, more Solemnly! It is to be feared, It is much to be feared, that many who ſeek this Privilege for their Children, looking upon it as an honorary Badge, which it is diſgraceful to want: I ſay that many forget the peculiar bonds and obligations they are under to Serve the LORD themſelves, and to take care that their Children be conſecrated to His Service. And then, unleſs Heads of Families take care that ſuch as are under their Government be Inſtructed; the Publick Diſpenſations of the Word and Ordinances will be likely to be loſt upon them. If they are not taught the Principles and firſt Rudiments of the Chriſtian Religion, nor acquainted with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truths and Myſteries of it, it can't be expected that the Word Preached ſhould profit them. For want of this, ſays One, <q>When we ſpeak never ſo plainly of the things pertaining to the kingdom of GOD, to the moſt we do but ſpeak Parables.</q> Unleſs our Children and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001854_0082_0FB91D52565B86A8"/>deep into their Hearts, if they have not a place in their Underſtandings. We ſee then that the Growth and Proſperity of the Churches of CHRIST do very ſtrongly oblige Heads of Families to teach ſuch as are under their Care, to Fear and Serve the LORD. And if Heads of Families would ſeriouſly ſet about this good Work of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Reformation, this would have an happy Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, by the Bleſſing of GOD, to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ds us a loud call and Incitation to Serve the LORD with our Houſes.</hi> Let us then receive the word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation which our Text and Doctrine give us, and comply with it. Let us firſt give up our <hi>Selves</hi> to the LORD; and then take care to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate our <hi>Houſes</hi> to His Service. What hath been ſaid under the Second Head concerning the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:001854_0090_0FB91D645691A620"/>which Heads of Families are under to Serve the LORD with their Houſes, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as Motives to enforce this Duty. Give me leave to add One or Two Hints, by way of Counſel and Direction.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>HAVE an Eye to this in your firſt Settlement, and begin to Serve the LORD with your Houſe, as ſoon as the Providence of GOD makes you the Head of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi> Let it be your Care and Endeavour to ſeek ſuch to dwell with you, as will heartily joyn with you in Serving the LORD; and will counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance True Religion in your Family. And when you are Settled in a Family, Let your firſt and chief Care be to Sanctify your Houſe, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate it to be a Temple for the Bleſſed GOD to dwell in; to be an Houſe of Prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in He ſhall be Worſhipped. Don't plead, that you are Afraid or Aſhamed to be Prieſt to your Family in this regard, and to lead in the Worſhip of GOD: But break through the Diſcouragements which lye in your way, with Chriſtian Courage and Reſolution. Delays in this Matter are very Dangerous. The longer we neglect to Serve the LORD in our Houſes, the more will our Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to live without GOD in our Houſes, grow and prevail upon us.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>LET us Watch against every Thing that would hinder us from Serving the LORD with our Houſes.</hi> Guard againſt Contentions and Diviſions; and ſee that you Prudently follow the Things which make for Peace. It can't be expected, that a Family ſhould be united in Serving the LORD, while the Houſe is Divided againſt it ſelf. Take care then to improve your Influence and Authority to keep
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:001854_0091_0FB91D65D69CA2A0"/>Peace in your Houſes; and beware of doing any Thing to Sow the Seeds of Diſcord and Contention.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, Shun Wicked and Profane Company. If you chooſe the Open Enemies of GOD and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for your Companions; If Perſons of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Lives, and Diſſolute Manners frequent your Houſes with Freedom: This will put a Damp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Family-Religion; and you and your Houſes will be in eminent Danger of learning their ways. If therefore you would Serve the LORD with your Houſes, you muſt ſay with him, Pſal. 6.8. <hi>Depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity.</hi> On the other Hand, You muſt ſeek the Fellowſhip and Acquaintance of ſuch as Serve the LORD with their Houſes, and will be ready to Encourage, Strengthen and Confirm you in this Excellent Service. It would be very Beautiful, very Profitable, if ſuch Houſes as are Houſholds of Faith, would cultivate an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Acquaintance, and Endearing Friendſhip each with other. And that, among other Things, for this very End, that they might ſtrengthen each other in Family-Piety, by their Amicable Union, and by their Communion in Offices of Kindneſs and Love.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>ENDEAVOUR ſo to Order your Secular Affairs, that they may not interfere with, or crowd out the Worſhip and Service of GOD.</hi> Every Thing is Beautiful in it's Seaſon; and that Buſineſs which is done <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably,</hi> is moſt likely to be <hi>well</hi> done. There is a Time when it's our Duty to be Worſhipping GOD in Secret: There is a Time when it is our Duty to be Worſhipping GOD in our Families: There is alſo a Time when it's our Duty to be Diligently Employ'd in our Particular Callings.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001854_0092_0FB91D675625FBA0"/>Now we muſt ſtudy ſo to Order our Affairs with Wiſdom and Diſcretion, that Religious Duties may have their proper <hi>Time</hi> allow'd them, and be attended upon in the moſt convenient Seaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>STUDY to make the Exerciſes of Religion as Eaſy, Pleaſant and Profitable as you can.</hi> Endeavour to draw your Children and Servants to joyn with you in Serving the LORD, by <hi>the Cords of a Man, and the Bands of Love.</hi> Countenance and Cheriſh what you ſee of Good in them; and let them ſee that you are <hi>Pleaſed,</hi> when they endeavour to <hi>Pleaſe</hi> and Serve the LORD. Let not your Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be Tedious, through the Length of them; but rather often Repeated and Inculcated. Let not your Diſcipline be exceſſively rigorous. Let your Family-Prayers be rather Fervent and Frequent, than very Long. Thus Endeavour to make your Religious Exerciſes as Eaſy, Pleaſant and Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as you can. It is true, GOD alone can give Perſons a Spiritual Reliſh for Divine Things; However, we muſt employ our Care and Diligence, not to Prejudice them againſt the Ways of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We muſt Labour, and be very Diligent in the Buſineſs of Religion: But ſhould Prudently endeavour, not to make it unneceſſarily Burdenſome to our ſelves or others.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>POUR out your Souls to GOD in Secret Prayer, for a Bleſſing on your Endeavours to Maintain and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Fear and Service of GOD in your Houſes.</hi> GOD alone can Crown your Endeavours with the deſired Succeſs, and make them Effectual to ſet up, and Eſtabliſh His Kingdom in your Houſes. You can't teach your Children or Servants to Know GOD Savingly; you can't Write the Laws of GOD
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:001854_0093_0FB91D6B17CEE8E0"/>on their Hearts. Unleſs GOD pour out His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon them, they will continue <hi>in the Gall of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and Bond of Iniquity;</hi> for all what you are able to do. <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is Celebrated in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his Care, to Command his Houſhold to keep GOD's Statutes, had a Mocking <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in his Family. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Profane <hi>Eſau; David,</hi> the Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter GOD's own Heart, a Wicked <hi>Abſalom.</hi> See then that you not only Pray <hi>with</hi> your Families; but alſo that you Pray to GOD in Secret <hi>for</hi> them; That GOD would make every One a Living Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for Him to dwell in; that He would pour His Spirit on your Seed, and His Bleſſing on your Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. You can't teach Men the Saving Knowlege of the Myſteries of Godlineſs, as you may teach them your Particular Calling. The Bleſſing of GOD's Common Providence is ſufficient for the latter; but the Influence of His Eſpecial Grace is neceſſary to Effect the former. Take Care then to Wreſtle with GOD in Secret Prayer as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, when he and his Houſhold were greatly Diſtreſſed, for Fear of his Brother <hi>Eſau.</hi> Then you may hope to Prevail with GOD to Command a Bleſſing on your Diligent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to Serve the LORD with your Houſes.</p>
               <p>THUS we have in an imperfect manner, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſome of the Duties which Maſters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies muſt Carefully attend unto, if they would Serve the LORD with their Houſes: As alſo ſome of the Obligations which they are under to Diſcharge theſe Duties; And have made ſome brief Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What Remains now, but that we Cry to GOD for His Holy Spirit, to make a Saving and Powerful Application of theſe Truths to our Souls; to put theſe Laws and Commands in our Inward Parts, and to Write them in our Hearts: That we
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:001854_0094_0FB91D6C97B64060"/>may be the <hi>Epiſtle of Chriſt, written not with Ink, but by the Spirit of the Living GOD.</hi> And that this Word of GOD may be in our Hearts, as Seed ſown in good Ground, bringing forth Fruit to Life Eternal. Let us now each of us be prevailed with to give up our ſelves to the LORD, to Obey and Serve Him for Ever. And the LORD grant, that Heads of Families may be perſwaded Seriouſly to Conſider how much they are Obliged to Maintain and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Service of GOD in their Houſes! O that all were brought to Subſcribe to <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Reſolution and Engagement, and to ſay, one and another of us, <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the LORD.</hi> If we be only the Hearers of the Word, it will be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>of Death unto Death,</hi> and Aggravate our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in the Day of Judgment. For our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath told us, Luk. 12.47. <hi>And that Servant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> But if we be not only the Hearers, but alſo the Doers of the Word; we ſhall be bleſſed in our Deed. For if we walk before GOD with a perfect Heart, and Serve Him Faithfully in our Houſes: Then GOD will dwell with us here; and we ſhall dwell with Him for ever. And when we ſhall leave our Houſes on Earth, we <hi>ſhall have a Building of GOD an Houſe not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi>
