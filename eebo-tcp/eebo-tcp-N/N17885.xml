            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE following Letters have long lain by the author in a ſtate of neglect; indeed of uncertainty whether the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them would do any credit to himſelf, or ſervice to the world. Nor does he think, that he ſhould ever have preſumed to expoſe them before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable tribunal of the public, unleſs animated by the name of the very exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and amiable perſonage, to whom they are addreſſed.</p>
                  <p>If they deſerve no fame, they ought, however, in his opinion, to be branded with no malignant or invidious cenſure, as their intention is really to ſerve the faireſt and moſt amiable part of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; to rouſe young ladies from a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant or inſipid life, into one of uſefulneſs, and laudable exertion—to recall them
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:023176_0004_0FBDE28C9CE95248"/>from viſionary novels and romances into ſolid reading and reflection—and from the criminal abſurdities of faſhion, to the ſimplicity of nature and the dignity of virtue.

                  <p>THE encouragement of every thing virtuous and laudable has been a diſtinguiſhing character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of your reign; and if licentiouſneſs and vice have infeſted the kingdom, it is not becauſe they have received any countenance from your ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign authority, or even wanted its moſt ſalutary reſtraints and pointed oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>To your own ſex, in particular, you have exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited a moſt inſtructive and animating example.— You have taught them by a ſilent, but impreſſive
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:023176_0007_0FBDE290EB14B790"/>language, to depend more for real influence and eſteem, on the mild, the ſoft, and the attractive graces, than on all the periſhable appendages of greatneſs, illuſtrious birth, political interference, or even the dazzling ſplendours of a throne.</p>
                  <p>In an age, when artificial gaieties have almoſt baniſhed the ſweeter pleaſures of ſimplicity and nature you have diſplayed as great a fondneſs, as the neceſſary avocations of royalty would permit, for domeſtic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>rement. Faſhionable mothers might have derived a leſſon from your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Your royal breaſt has appeared to vibrate with a more exquiſite delight, to the careſſes of a tender offspring, in the ſhades of Windſor, than it ever received from crowded levees, or the ſuperb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt brilliance of a court.</p>
                  <p>In a period of falſe refinement, when conjugal fidelity has not appeared a favourite virtue, your Majeſty has been a model of as delicate an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ever graced the pureſt ages of antiquity, or occurs in the voluminous annals of the world. And in an era of faſtidious affluence, when Criſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity has been undermined by the ſubtilty of ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſtill more diſgraced by the lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and irregularities of its profeſſors; when its grand bulwark, the chriſtian ſabbath, has been dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly attacked, particularly amongſt the higher ranks of people, by many kinds of licentious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, you have done every thing in co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with our beloved Monarch, to ſtop the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the evil, that could reſult from virtuous precepts, or the unſullied luſtre of example.</p>

                     <pb n="xi" facs="unknown:023176_0008_0FBDE2926644D448"/>
Amidſt this <hi>general</hi> aſſemblage of virtues, there is one point, however, in which your Majeſty's character ſhines forth with <hi>peculiar</hi> luſtre, and will command the grateful veneration of the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant poſterity. It is that, which is particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced in this work, and ſo cloſely interwoven with the moſt eſſential intereſt of ſociety—female education. This, your Majeſty is allowed to have ſtudied with greater earneſtneſs than any woman throughout your domi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ions; I may add, with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſs. Your royal daughters are a daily <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> comment on the excellence of your inſtructions, and are infinitely more celebrated for the graces of their hearts, the elegance of their manners, and the improvement of their underſtanding, than the magnificence of their family, or the ſplendour of their birth.</p>
                  <p>I cannot, therefore, but be deeply ſenſible of the high honour, that was conferred on me, when your Majeſty condeſcended to look into this work in manuſcript, and give me the unreſerved privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of inſcribing it to your protection; and I would take a reſpectful leave of your Majeſty with uttering an earneſt wiſh, which, elevated as you are, muſt come near the heart—that the daughters you have cultivated with ſuch a tender aſſiduity, may long continue (what they <hi>are,</hi>) the ornament of their ſex—of their kingdom—of Europe—the prop, when ſhe wants it, of their declining parent; your conſolers in that awful moment, when even Majeſty muſt be duſt, and your companions in that heaven, where the virtues will remain, though ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and greatneſs and diſtinctions are forgotten!</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>THOUGH I myſelf have ſuſtained an heavy loſs by the death of your excellent mother, who lived ſo much in my friendſhip and eſteem, and by her letters and ſociety had conferred upon me ſome of the ſweeteſt pleaſures in human life, yet you alas! are the principal ſufferer by this afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpenſation. It would give me the ſincereſt pleaſure, if I knew how to alleviate your grief, or afford you a ſingle moment's conſolation.</p>
                     <p>I need not preſs on you the doctrines of religion. You have, doubtleſs, conſidered who it is, that has deprived you of this invaluable parent; a God of infinite wiſdom, who never ſtrikes, but at the ſitteſt moment; a God of equal goodneſs, who without the ſtrongeſt reaſons, would not afflict,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:023176_0011_0FBDE297AF216248"/>and a being of unbounded power, who is abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly able to make up your loſs, and open to you a thouſand ſources of comfort.</p>
                     <p>Chriſtianity ſhould exclude all <hi>unreaſonable</hi> ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. If we believe that our friends are dead in God; we know that this life is only a vapour; that our ſeparation is but for a moment, and that we ſhall ſoon be reſtored to them in a world, where life is without pain, and where friendſhip is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</p>
                     <p>Though you are, in the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, an orphan, yet the number of friends, to whom you are ſo juſtly dear, will render your ſituation neither ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, nor defenceleſs. The ſenſible, the elegant and the good will think themſelves honoured by your acquaintance. They will give you credit for inheriting all the amiable qualities of a mother, who was revered, as far as known, whilſt nature has ſo ſtrongly imprinted, on your face, the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of her features.</p>
                     <p>The ſcene is ſtill freſh upon my memory, when, in her laſt moments, ſhe ſo ſtrongly recommended you to my protection. And though ſhe paid a compliment to my abilities, which only a partial friendſhip could have excited, ſhe did nothing more than ſtrict juſtice to the warmth of my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall really think myſelf complimented by your correſpondence. If you will call me father or brother, you will give an unuſual luſtre to my name. This fond heart ſhall vibrate to your wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and your happineſs: and, if you will occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally viſit my little cot, it ſhall put on all its lovelieſt charms, and ſmile in all its gayeſt attire, to receive ſo dear and ſo amiable a ſtranger. The roſes of my humble garden ſhall, if poſſible, be doubly

                     <p>We ſhall reap, I am aſſured, <hi>mutual</hi> benefits by this acquaintance. If I am able to communicate to you any little knowledge, you will more than repay it by that eaſe, delicacy, refinement, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and expanſion, which the mind never effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually feels, but in the friendſhip of a ſenſible and an intereſting woman. Such a friendſhip is the richeſt cordial of life. Either of the ſexes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, are never what they ſhould be. Like the beſt figures, <hi>mutilated,</hi> they appear to diſadvantage. Unnatural expedients may be tried to ſupply its place. Buſineſs, ambition, an <hi>over-ſtrained</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or peculiar ſituations may lead us to deny ourſelves ſo ſweet a pleaſure; but, in fact, all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man projects and ſucceſſes are <hi>inſipid</hi> without it. They are roſeleſs thorns, a winter without a ſpring. Pleaſures have not their reliſh, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row wants a boſom to recline on. Our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have not their proper ſoftneſs; our morals their purity, and our ſouls feel an uncomfortable void.</p>
                     <p>They, who talk degradingly of women, do not know the value of the treaſure they deſpiſe. They have not ſufficient taſte to reliſh their excellencies, or purity enough to court their acquaintance. They have taken the portrait of <hi>abandoned</hi> women, and they think the features applicable to all.</p>
                     <p>The ſofter ſex, it is certain, are exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by their education. If they were, what they <hi>ſhould</hi> be, they are thoſe lights in the picture of human life, that are intended to cheer all its dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and its ſhades.</p>

                     <p>THE education of women is unfortunately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected rather to ſuch accompliſhments, as will enable them to make a noiſe and ſparkle in the world, than to thoſe qualities, which might enſure their comfort here, and happineſs hereafter. Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchools conſult but little thoſe domeſtic qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifications, which are confeſſedly the higheſt point of uſefulneſs in your ſex, and ſtill leſs that ſolid piety and virtue, which alone, to an intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can be the ſource of any real, heart-felt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Though religion is indiſpenſably neceſſary to <hi>both</hi> ſexes, and in every poſſible character and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet a woman ſeems, more puculiarly, to need its enlivening ſupports, whilſt her frame muſt be confeſſed to be admirably calculated for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all the tender and devout affections.</p>
                     <p>The timidity, ariſing from the natural weakneſs and delicacy of your frame; the numerous diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to which you are liable; that exquiſite ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which in many of you, vibrate to the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt touch of joy or ſorrow; the tremulous anxiety you have for friends, children, a family, which nothing can relieve, but a ſenſe of their being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of God; the ſedentarineſs of your life, naturally followed with low ſpirits or <hi>ennui,</hi> whilſt we are ſeeking health and pleaſure in the field; and the many, lonely hours, which in almoſt every ſituation, are likely to be your lot, will expoſe you to a number of <hi>peculiar</hi> ſorrows,

                        </gap>a, that you become marriageable, the ſphere of your anxieties and afflictions will be enlarged. The generality of men are far from act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſuch ſtrict principles of honour and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in their connexions with you, as they would rigidly obſerve, in matters of a much more trivial importance. Some delight in ſporting with your niceſt ſenſibilities, and afterwards expoſing with an <hi>illiberal</hi> triumph, the fondneſs of a credulous and unſuſpecting heart; others, from faſhion merely, and to be called men of gallantry, will ſay a thouſand civil things, and ſhew as many prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, with no other view, than to amuſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or acquire a fantaſtic, viſionary honour. A third ſort of men (yes it is poſſible that there ſhould be <hi>male</hi> coquettes!) will do and ſay every thing to inſpire you with fondneſs, and get poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your heart, whithout proceeding to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, which nature has intended to come from <hi>us,</hi> and which the delicacy of your ſex, whatever you may <hi>ſuffer,</hi> will not permit you to demand. Others, without any particular deſigns upon you, or improper attentions, (for attachments ſpring up <hi>inſenſibly,</hi> and are as poſſible in one ſex. as the other,) may be too agreeable for your ſafety and repoſe, and leave you to a ſilent, heartfelt concern, which will prey <hi>doubly</hi> in proportion to its <hi>conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> —or even when the indiſſoluble knot of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is tied, and you have reſigned every thing, till it comes to your name and perſon, it may be to a man of <hi>mere</hi> integrity, who knows nothing of thoſe many, little, tender attentions, which involve ſo great a ſhare of a woman's happineſs—it may
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023176_0015_0FBDE29E3662E5B8"/>be to a perſon of great <hi>ambition,</hi> who has neither leiſure nor inclination for ſoft domeſtic ſcenes—it may be to a faſhionable <hi>Inſipid,</hi> who, for the ſake of flirting with ſome elegant fair, and giving your <hi>jealouſy</hi> the wildeſt range, leaves <hi>your</hi> charms and the endearments of his <hi>children</hi> to periſh in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect—nay ſtakes, perhaps, his very <hi>laſt</hi> thouſand on the uncertainty of game, when the unhappy throw may conſign both you and your helpleſs babes to poverty and ruin—or it may be to a perſon of a peeviſh, ill-natured, ſaturnine caſt, <hi>artfully</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, till he had you in poſſeſſion, which no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions can alter, no charms can ſweeten, and no vivacity can cheer. Under theſe, or indeed any <hi>other</hi> diſtreſſes, religion is the only true and unfail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſource, and its hopes and proſpects, the only ſolid baſis of conſolation. In your many, <hi>ſolitary</hi> moments, what can afford the mind ſo ſovereign a relief, as the exerciſe of devotion to an all-preſent God? and, when domeſtic ſorrows cluſter upon you, which you cannot reveal to any friend on <hi>earth,</hi> what method have you left, but to pour them into the boſom of your father in <hi>heaven,</hi> who is confeſſedly the friend of the friendleſs, always willing to hear their cries, and always able to protect.</p>
                     <p>The period, my dear girl, I truſt, is diſtant, when ſuch afflictions ſhall attack your glowing ſenſibility.

                     <p>Is it not then a certain concluſion, that he creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, as well as all <hi>inferior</hi> animals for happineſs? On <hi>this</hi> you may depend, as much as you can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>certainty</hi> of your exiſtence, and that he is

                     <p>Open the <hi>ſacred book,</hi> and, from beginning to end, it will confirm this opinion, and exalt your ideas of the divine perfections. <q>I delight in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing loving-kindneſs, ſaith the Lord.—The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over, all his works. If he clothes the graſs of the field, which, to-day, is, and to-morrow is caſt into the oven, how much more ſhall he clothe you, O ye of little faith?</q> 
                        <hi>That</hi> religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is built on <hi>wrong</hi> notions, or a <hi>melancholy</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that fills us with <hi>imaginary</hi> terrors. All na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture breathes a language of hope and mercy. And <hi>nature</hi> is the meſſenger of God.</p>
                     <p>It is true there is <hi>evil</hi> in the world, as well as good; there are marks of <hi>judgment,</hi> as well as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. There are hurricanes, as well as fanning breezes; <hi>noxious</hi> are intermixed with uſeful ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; <hi>poiſonous</hi> and ſalutary herbs grow <hi>beſide</hi> each other, and roſes have their thorns. There are wars and rumours of wars; there are earthquakes, that deſolate <hi>whole</hi> countries; a thouſand forms of diſeaſe; a thouſand modifications of ſorrow, anxiety, death. If he, who ſits at the helm, be ſo gracious, whence all this diſorder? If his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power be combined with equal wiſdom and goodneſs, why did he not prevent it?</p>
                     <p>If men were not to be free agents, the <hi>total</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſin and evil ſeems an <hi>impoſſibility.</hi> Moral <hi>liberty</hi> could not conſiſt with a <hi>mechanical,</hi> forced obedience; and if we had <hi>not</hi> been free, the idea of puniſhments or rewards, of an heaven or an hell, would be the greateſt of all poſſible abſurdities. So that the queſtion <hi>ultimately</hi> amounts to this,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023176_0024_0FBDE2AB2DFBFCE8"/>whether it was proper for the Almighty to create ſuch a world at all? Had we not better reſerve the propriety of this conduct to be diſputed with him, at his great tribunal? <hi>There,</hi> I doubt not, we ſhall be amply convinced, that the creation was a work of infinite <hi>mercy,</hi> as well as power, and that a greater degree of <hi>happineſs,</hi> than miſery has ariſen from it. There too, when we are able to diſcern with <hi>glorified</hi> eyes, the whole chain of cauſes and effects, from the beginning, to the end, of time; the dependence of one link of being on another, and of worlds, on worlds; this evil we now complain of, may become a means of exalting our ideas of the attributes of the Almighty; and we ſhall bluſh at ourſelves for even having queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his goodneſs for a moment, or encouraged a reaſoning pride, ſo ill becoming creatures, whoſe days are few, whoſe ſtrength is weakneſs, whoſe wiſdom folly; and who, in the preſent <hi>immure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of their underſtanding, ſcarcely know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a blade of graſs, or of the very pebbles, on which they tread.</p>
                     <p>This queſtion concerning the <hi>origin</hi> of evil has puzzled the whole tribe of reaſoners and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, from the creation, to the preſent moment. The ſcripture alone has ſolved the enigma to our ſatisfaction. This deranged ſtate of things is the providential puniſhment of guilt, but at the ſame time, contrived in mercy, as a ſalutary regimen, and as a mode of purifying fallen creatures for the innocence and happineſs of a better world. It is a <hi>chao;,</hi> fitted to our <hi>preſent</hi> conſtitution, and will refine, as <hi>we</hi> do, into its primitive beauty and ſplendour. <q>There ſhall then be new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023176_0025_0FBDE2ACAC79C5D0"/>The wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard lie down with the kid, when the earth is full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſeas.</q> Reſignation, in the mean time, has a balm for ſuffering, and the faith of a chriſtian <q>looketh to a better country, with foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſpeculations apart, if you draw nigh to the Almighty, he will draw nigh to you; if you ſeek his favor and friendſhip, all things ſhall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for your good.

                        <salute>MY DEAR GIRL,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>DEVOTION, conſidered ſimply in itſelf, is an intercourſe betwixt us and God; betwixt the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023176_0026_0FBDE2AE5D630A70"/>ſelf-exiſtent, inconceivable ſpirit, which formed and preſerves the univerſe, and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſpirit, with which, for awful reaſons, he has animated a portion of <hi>matter</hi> upon earth, that we call man. It is a ſilent act, in which the ſoul diveſts itſelf of <hi>outward</hi> things, flies into heaven, and pours forth all its wants, wiſhes, hopes, fears, guilt or pleaſures, into the boſom of an <hi>almighty</hi> friend.</p>
                     <p>Though this devotion, in its firſt ſtages, may be a weariſome or <hi>inſipid</hi> exerciſe, yet this ariſes mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the depravity of nature, and of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. A little <hi>habit</hi> will overcome this reluctance. When you have fairly entered on your journey, <q>the ways of this wiſdom will be ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and all its paths, peace.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>True devotion, doubtleſs, requires a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of <hi>abſtraction</hi> from the world. Hence <hi>modern</hi> chriſtians treat it, as a <hi>viſion.</hi> Hence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>modern</hi> writers have little of its unction. But it glows in the ſcriptures. It warms us in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It burned in an Auſtin, and in many other of thoſe perſecuted martyrs, who now are with God.</p>
                     <p>That we <hi>hear</hi> little of it, is not wonderful. It makes no noiſe in the circles of the learned or of the elegant. Under an heap of worldly cares, we <hi>ſmother</hi> the lovely infant, and will not let it breathe. Vanity, ambition, pleaſure, avarice, quench the celeſtial fire. And theſe alas! are too much the god of <hi>mortals!</hi> Ever ſince the world began, writers have been amuſing us only with <hi>ſhadows</hi> of this piety, inſtead of giving us its <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> Superſtition has placed it in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ceremonies, auſterities, pilgrimages, <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:023176_0027_0FBDE2AFB01DA468"/>an auguſt temple, or ſplendid imagery, which had little connexion with ſentiment or ſpirit. Enthuſiaſm has ſwelled with <hi>unnatural</hi> conceptions, and obtruded a <hi>ſpurious</hi> offspring on the world, inſtead of this engaging child of reaſon and truth; whilſt the lukewarm have reſted in a few out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties, which have had no vigour, and, as they ſprung not from the heart, never entered the temple of the moſt High.</p>
                     <p>Real piety is of a very different, and of a much more <hi>animated,</hi> nature. It looks up to God, ſees, hears, feels him, in every event, in every viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in all places, in all ſeaſons, and upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. It is theory, vivified by experience. It is faith, <hi>ſubſtantiated</hi> by <hi>mental</hi> enjoyment. It is heaven, tranſplanted into the human boſom. It is the radiance of the Divinity, warming and incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling man. It is <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe, gratified by <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> ſenſations. Without <hi>this,</hi> all <hi>ceremonies</hi> are inefficacious. Books, prayers, ſacraments and meditations are but a body, without a ſoul, or a ſtatue, without animation.</p>
                     <p>That man is <hi>capable</hi> of ſuch an intercourſe with his maker, there are many <hi>living</hi> witneſſes to prove. Without having recourſe to the viſions of fanatics, or the dreams of enthuſiaſts, it may be proved to ſpring from natural and <hi>philoſophical</hi> cauſes. God is a ſpirit; ſo is the mind. <hi>Bodies</hi> can have intercourſe; ſo can <hi>ſouls.</hi> When minds are in an <hi>aſſimilating</hi> ſtate of purity, they have union with their Maker. This was the bliſs of <hi>paradiſe;</hi> ſin interrupted, and holineſs muſt reſtore it. To a ſoul, thus diſpoſed, the creator commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates himſelf, in a manner, which is as inſenſible to the natural eye, as the falling of dews, but not
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023176_0028_0FBDE2B12DFA1C70"/>leſs refreſhing to its ſecret powers, than <hi>that</hi> is to vegetation.</p>
                     <p>The primitive ſaints are deſcribing this, when they ſpeak of their tranſports. David felt it, when he longed for God, as the heart panteth after the water brooks. St. Paul knew it, when he gloried in his tribulations. It was <hi>embodied</hi> in him, when he was carried up into the third heavens, and heard things, impoſſible to be uttered. St. Stephen was filled with it, when he ſaw the heavens open, and prayed for his murderers. By it, martyrs were ſupported, when they were ſtoned, and ſawn aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And till we feel it in <hi>ourſelves,</hi> we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fully know, how gracious the Lord is.</p>
                     <p>If you can acquire this ſpiritual <hi>abſtraction,</hi> you will, at once, have made your fortune for eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It will be of little moment, what is your lot on earth, or what the diſtinguiſhing viciſſitudes of your life. Proſperity or adverſity, health or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, honor or diſgrace, a cottage or a crown, will all be ſo many inſtruments of glory. The whole creation will become a <hi>temple.</hi> Every event and every object will lead your mind to God, and in his greatneſs and perfections, you will inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly loſe the littleneſs, the glare and tinſel of all human things.</p>
                     <p>If I wiſhed only to ſet off your <hi>perſon</hi> to the greateſt advantage, I would recommend this true <hi>ſublime</hi> of religion. It gives a pleaſing ſerenity to the countenance, and a cheerfulneſs to the ſpirits beyond the reach of art, or the power of affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It communicates a real tranſport to the mind, which diſſipation mimics only for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a ſweetneſs to the diſpoſition, and a <hi>luſtre</hi> to the manners, which all the airs of modern po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023176_0029_0FBDE2B2B0B56410"/>ſtudy but in vain. Eaſy in yourſelf, it will make you in perfect good humour with the world, and when you are diffuſing happineſs around you, <q>you will only be dealing out the broken fragments, that remain after you have eaten.</q>

                     <p>Public worſhip and the ſacraments are the grand <hi>outwork</hi> of piety. They are the <hi>doors,</hi> by which we enter the ſanctuary of God.

Whoever pretends to be <hi>above</hi> theſe forms, is the <hi>fanatic,</hi> who might as well tell us, that his animal life can be ſupported without food; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſpiſes them, is the Infidel, that does every thing in his power, to root out the remembrance of God from the earth, and violate the deareſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of mankind.

                     <p>ANOTHER excellent method of inkindling piety, is <hi>reading the ſcriptures.</hi> A chriſtian, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſhould have this ſacred book, ever folded in his breaſt. There is a richneſs and a comfort in it, that nothing elſe can equal. Every word is big with inſtruction; every ſentence is divine. It is a mine, perpetually opening; the deeper we
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023176_0031_0FBDE2B5B049C930"/>dig, the richer is the ore. It is a feaſt, adapted to <hi>every</hi> taſte; the moſt exalted underſtanding muſt admire, and the <hi>loweſt</hi> cannot fail to comprehend, its inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>If people only read for the ſake of <hi>entertainment,</hi> where can they find a book equal to the Bible? What other production, either ancient or modern, has ſuch ſtriking paſſages of the pathetic and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, the vehement and impaſſioned? Where are there ſuch lofty images, ſuch grand conceptions, or ſuch pictureſque and animated deſcriptions, as in the pſalms? There is ſcarcely a perſon in the world, to whoſe caſe ſome of them are not adapted, nor a ſorrow which they cannot ſooth. In one part, plaintive, affecting, penitential; in another full of triumph and exultation, ennobling elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; here deſcribing the immenſity, majeſty, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence and omnipreſence of God; there the littleneſs of the world, and the vanity of man; whoever can read them without emotion, muſt be pronounced void both of piety and taſte.</p>
                     <p>The prophets are the true <hi>ſublime</hi> of holy reading. The bold images, metaphors, alluſions and deſcriptions, with which they abound, have been the admiration of the moſt accompliſhed ſcholars, orators and critics in the world. The proverbs of Solomon and the book of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus are an excellent ſyſtem for the government of private life, as well as a fund of ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction! They have all the <hi>marrow</hi> of our <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> ſyſtems of good breeding, without any of their <hi>poiſon.</hi> The ſacred ſtories of the ſcripture are related with amazing ſimplicity and pathos; the parables are beautifully pointed and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and the epiſtles of St. Paul are a model
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023176_0032_0FBDE2B73582B718"/>of the ſublimeſt and moſt energetic eloquence, that can be found in any age, or in any language.</p>
                     <p>When the immortal Locke and Newton had dived into every <hi>other</hi> kind of knowledge, they ſat down to contemplate the vanity and poverty of all, in the richneſs of the ſcriptures. The famous Bacon, an oracle of learning, in his day, and the wonder of all ſucceeding ages, confeſſed them to be the ſource of all <hi>real wiſdom.</hi> The il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Selden, on his death-bed, aſſured arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Uſher, that the <hi>whole</hi> of his immenſe library could not give him half the comfort, which he derived from one <hi>ſingle</hi> ſentence of the inſpired writings; and Addiſon, whoſe name muſt be ever dear to every friend of religion and virtue, ſpent no little time in collecting together, and arranging into one common point of view, the united evidences of the chriſtian religion.</p>
                     <p>The primitive chriſtians uſed to read this book, on their knees.

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023176_0033_0FBDE2B8AE0BA0D0"/>teſtimony to the truth of revelation; as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the circumſtances, manners, and anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes of a peculiar, choſen people, whoſe hiſtory, rebellion, captivity and diſperſion are interwoven with the whole ſyſtem of chriſtianity, you will read them with a greater reliſh, and more godly edification.</p>
                     <p>Jeſus Chriſt is the foundation of the apoſtles and prophets; all the incidents you read, point to him, as their origin, and as their end; <q>the great corner ſtone in Zion; the lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The bondage of the children of Iſrael in Egypt, is an image of <hi>our</hi> captivity to ſin and their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, of our redemption through the blood of Chriſt; their journeying through the wilderneſs, is a ſtrong picture of our weariſome paſſage through this vale of tears. Moſes is the Saviour, making waters of comfort guſh from the ſtony rock; the manna is the food of his word, and the waters are the graces of his holy ſpirit; the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and affecting hiſtory of Joſeph is an emblem of that better perſonage, who was envied, hated, perſecuted and murdered by his brethren, for the general ſalvation: Abraham is a ſtriking image of the Almighty, offering up his only ſon, and all the <hi>ceremonies</hi> of the law point to that true <hi>blood</hi> of ſprinkling, which alone can take away the ſins of the world. Thus is <hi>every</hi> page holy; thus do you tread, every moment, on conſecrated ground, and thus every word, when <hi>properly</hi> underſtood, is ſpirit and is life.</p>
                     <p>But of <hi>all</hi> the ſcriptures, the goſpels are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt edifying and inſtructive. They are plain, forcible, ſpiritual; they come from the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023176_0034_0FBDE2BA2F5C92A0"/>very mouth of holineſs and wiſdom, and do not admit of any wrong conſtructions or doubtful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations. If there was only the fifth chapter of St. Matthew's goſpel extant, we ſhould have an incomparable abridgement of chriſtianity, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to direct our faith, to animate our practice, and flaſh confuſion on that hoſt of writers, who have built ſo many ſtrong and dangerous opinions on the pretended baſis of revelation.</p>
                     <p>Commentators may ſerve to explain an eaſtern cuſtom, ceremony, alluſion or mode of expreſſion, but I cannot in general, recommend them, at leaſt to young people. They embarraſs more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than they direct; they have often perplexed, what, in itſelf, was clear, and darkened, where they affected to illuminate. The ſayings of our Lord are ſo very obvious, as to need little or no explanation. They are a precious wine, which the profane wiſdom of ſcholars and philoſophers has mixed with water. If men had only ſtudied them with earneſtneſs, inſtead of their own intereſts, prejudices and paſſions, we ſhould never have been diſtracted with ſo many ſyſtems of error and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</p>
                     <p>Do not read much, at a time. Meditation is the ſtomach, which digeſts this food; you ſhould <hi>reflect</hi> many hours, for reading <hi>one.</hi> And there is ſuch a condenſed richneſs in the ſcriptures, that one ſingle verſe will often ſuggeſt an ample fund for ſerious contemplation.</p>
                     <p>Every moment, that you peruſe this book, conſider yourſelf as in the immediate preſence of your Maker. Fancy that you heard him, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the commandments, in all the thunder and lightning of the mount. Remember that, though
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023176_0035_0FBDE2BBAF9C2028"/>heaven and earth fail, one jot or one tittle ſhall, in no wiſe, paſs from the law, till all be fulfilled. Conſider what a number of holy men have ſealed the truth of this teſtimony with their blood. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine yourſelf by the promiſes and threatenings, as you go along, and do not forget to bleſs God, upon your knees, that he has given you ſuch a lamp for your feet, and ſuch a light to your paths.</p>
                     <p>Without this ſacred volume, the world would have been, at this very moment, conſiderably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlightened; worſhipping ſtocks or ſtones, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps offering human blood, and tormenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with burdenſome ceremonies, that had no manner of connection with the heart; immerſed in ſorrows, which they could not have eaſed, and perplexed with a thouſand, gloomy enigmas, which they never could have ſolved. The light, which ſuperficial ſceptics vaunt, as that of <hi>nature</hi> or phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, or, in a great degree, derived from the ſcriptures. The arguments, which they level againſt chriſtianity, have been ſuggeſted by the light of chriſtianity itſelf.</p>

                     <p>THOUGH I have reprobated <hi>prolix</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, there are, however, ſeveral little books, which will illuſtrate and enliven the ſacred writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and enable you to read them with greater
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023176_0036_0FBDE2BD5D72DD38"/>pleaſure and advantage. Melmoth, on the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ſublime of ſcripture, falls under this deſcription. He will ſuggeſt ſome ſtriking paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which before may have eſcaped your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                     <p>The Comteſſe le Genlis is intitled to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of all young people. She is poſſeſſed of an elegant taſte, a ſplendid ſtyle, and a very enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed underſtanding. She has thrown into a dramatic form, ſeveral of the hiſtorical parts of the Bible; and though the chaſtity of an Engliſh taſte is not eaſily reconciled to ſeriouſneſs "in ſo queſtionable a ſhape," her ingenuity ſparkles through the whole performance, and has given it a pathos, an <hi>intereſt</hi> and a brilliancy, that will both improve your heart, and delight your imagination.</p>
                     <p>I ſcarcely know a woman, that deſerves ſo much from the community at large, as Mrs. Trimmer. Her ſacred Hiſtory is a well known, uſeful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: her unwearied labours for the ſervice of the poor, in her <hi>Family Magazine,</hi> and her act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive patronage of Sunday Schools, beſpeak an heart, that is warm with benevolence, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of no <hi>ordinary</hi> ſize. The pride of philoſophy and profound learning may, perhaps look <hi>down</hi> on ſuch attempts, as beneath their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. But how can talents be ſo uſefully, or ſo amiably employed, as when ſtripped of their gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy plumage, they condeſcend to inſtruct, to bleſs and reform the meaneſt of mankind. <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> reaſonings are for the <hi>learned few,</hi> and often miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead <hi>them;</hi> theſe <hi>practical</hi> labours conſult the good of <hi>millions,</hi> and will continue to edify, when all ſuch cobweb ſyſtems are totally demoliſhed, and their authors conſigned to the oblivion, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>

There is not, perhaps, a better method of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcripture to advantage, than that uſed by the good biſhop Wilſon, in his <hi>Sacra Privata.</hi> He ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects a few, detached verſes, and, in his natural and eaſy ſtyle, raiſes upon <hi>each,</hi> a train of reflexions, which muſt inkindle and animate the devotion of every reader.</p>
                     <p>Doddridges paraphraſe on the new teſtament may be juſtly recommended for its zeal, piety, earneſtneſs and animation. Nor does it want the embelliſhments of a lively fancy, or of an eaſy and unadorned language. But, like moſt diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his time, he was a pupil of the Calviniſtic ſchool; and though I ſhall never be a convert to his ſyſtem, I cannot but approve the <hi>general</hi> air and ſpirit of his writings. There are few things or characters in life, any more than authors, that are formed to command an unreſerved admiration. The moſt delightful landſkip has its ſhades. The moſt animated countenance has frequently <hi>ſome</hi> feature imperfect, or diſtorted. There will be <hi>accidental</hi> heats and fluſhes on the moſt delicate complexion.</p>

                     <p>As a public ſyſtem of devocion, that of our church is excellent. How ſimple and energetic is the language! How rich and beautifully <hi>varied,</hi> are the collects!

                     <p>Two <hi>capital</hi> traits will ſtrike you in our liturgy; the great ſtreſs, laid upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and the continual interceſſion for the bleſſings of the <hi>body ſpirit.</hi> Theſe are, indeed, the grand loſſon to be learned from it, as well as from the ſcriptures.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023176_0039_0FBDE2C1AF7B8868"/>They are the <hi>pillars</hi> of the church; the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of the chriſtian ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>Without the atonement of Chriſt, criminals as we are, there never could have been any hope of mercy; without the aſſiſtance and graces of the ſpirit, we could not have been purified for the manſions of glory. If Chriſt has been called the fun of righteouſneſs, the holy ſpirit is the air, which purifies and invigorates the whole moral world, and preſerves it from ſtagnation and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>Meditate frequently on theſe ſufferings of Chriſt, till you abhor every ſin, that produced them; and in order to be enriched with all graces and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, pray daily and fervently for this holy ſpirit. The good Biſhop Kenn has a few words, in one of his hymns, which wonderfully epitomize out peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and our wants:</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOUR ſacred reading needs not to be wholly confined to the ſcriptures. A few, other ſerious
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023176_0040_0FBDE2C3381DFF50"/>books will aſſiſt your piety, as well as ſerve to <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate</hi> and confirm the ſcriptures themſelves.</p>
                     <p>I cannot, in this reſpect, ſo much recommend <hi>modern</hi> ſermons, as ſome little practical treatiſes of piety. Engliſh diſcourſes in general, by a ftrange, ſcholaſtic miſmanagement, are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently addreſſed to the <hi>heart.</hi> Either they are learned diſquiſitions, on ſome <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſubject, more calculated to diſplay abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than to edify; or they are ſpruce, moral eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays with little more of <hi>chriſtianity</hi> in them, than might be gleaned from the works of Plato or Epic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus. They want that ſimplicity, fire, energy, animation, that boldneſs of images, appeal to the conſcience, and that pictureſque diſplay of heaven and hell, which give ſuch an unction to the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of St. Paul, and of the fathers. They do not thunder and lighten at the ſinner: they do not carry us by a whirlwind, into heaven, and ſhew us thrones and ſceptres; they convince, but they do not animate; they <hi>glitter,</hi> but they do not <hi>warm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ancient divines have more fire and matter. They ſtudied the ſcriptures, more than <hi>human</hi> ſyſtems. "They were filled with the ſpirit;" they were men of watchfulneſs and prayers. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſpirit of criticiſm or of philoſophy, falſely ſo called, makes <hi>us</hi> cold and languid. In pervading many learned or ſplendid pages, the heart is often left devoid of one, pious emotion.</p>
                     <p>Many ſermons, no doubt, are to be excepted from this cenſure. Thoſe of Archbiſhop Secker contain a fund of ſolid matter, piety and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the <hi>ſtyle</hi> is rather ſingular and uncouth. The marble is rich, but it is unpoliſhed, There
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023176_0041_0FBDE2C4ACE70690"/>is ſuch a thing, as an elegant ſimplicity. Seeker had a ſimplicity without this elegance.</p>
                     <p>Few prelates, however, have deſerved ſo well from the church, or poſterity. The metropolitan, though placed in the boſom of a court, had neither pride, indolence, nor adulation. His vigilance was extraordinary; his labours unremitting, and his crofier but an imperfect emblem of the real paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral zeal, "which eat up his ſoul." The preſent biſhop of London has all the ſimplicity of his illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious patron, tiſſued with that elegance, which the archbiſhop wanted. His ſermous have been <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally</hi> read; they are written on a truly evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical plan; and their object is not merely to <hi>amuſe,</hi> but to inſtruct and edify.</p>

                     <p>EVERY perſon ſhould read the diſcourſes of Sherlock, who wiſhes to ſee the grand doctrines of chriſtianity properly illuſtrated, and inforced with equal energy of argument and language. Sherlock is one of the few, <hi>original</hi> writers of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.

                     <p>Ogden's Sermons have very great, original me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Perhaps I <hi>miſcalled</hi> them; they are, more properly, ſketches on ſacred ſubjects; on the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental articles of the chriſtian faith. There is more vigour, and energy and conviction in one page of this writer, than in whole volumes of ſome others, who have received a much more general applauſe.</p>
                     <p>The doctor ſeems particularly to have ſtudied conciſeneſs, and his <hi>miniature</hi> plan ſometimes leaves the features of his pieces indiſtinct.

                     <p>THE late, unfortunate Dr. Dodd owed, I ſhould conceive, his great popularity to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his voice, perſon, manner, geſture and addreſs. For indeed his compoſitions have not intrinſic merit enough to have challenged any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary applauſe.</p>
                     <p>Weak, flimſy, ſuperficial in his arguments, and rather plauſible, than energetic in his language, it muſt have been only the <hi>popularity</hi> of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the new vein of <hi>pathetic,</hi> which he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his fortunate congenial ſituation at the Magdalen, and in a metropolis, which, under the management of ſuch advantages, procured him his extenſive, <hi>temporary</hi> reputation.</p>
                     <p>But alas! his popularity was very dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed! It was built on the ruins of his innocence and virtue. Happy, if he had lived and died in obſcurity, or been an humble curate in ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered village, where jeſſamines had claſped round his unenvied manſion, with unenlightened ruſtics only for his aſſociates! Admiration would not then have dazzled his eyes. His vanity could not have ſought thoſe <hi>unequal</hi> connexions, which he afterwards found himſelf unable to ſupport, nor expenſive pleaſures led him to an action, which wounded religion in its very vitals, and brought ſo much diſgrace on his ſacred profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>He might, then, like many other excellent men, have "fallen aſleep," amidſt the tender offices of bewailing friends; and grateful villagers,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023176_0045_0FBDE2CAADDE66B0"/>would have wetted his monument with tears of heart-felt gratitude and eſteem. He is now a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, riſing high in the boſom of the ocean, which ſays to the wary mariner, <q>beware of rocks and quickſands.</q> It has been ſaid, that Dodd, in the beginning of his ſacred office, was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pious. What is the concluſion? Hear it from compaſſion. Bathed in tears. ſhe lifts up her voice, and cries aloud, <q>Let him who thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</q>

                     <p>Faringdon's Sermons have very ſingular merit. It is but ſeldom that ſo much vivacity finds its way into this ſpecies of writing.

                     <p>The fingular merit of this little book is obvious from its tranſlation into almoſt all languages. Ganganelli aſcribes it, with pride, to an <hi>Italian</hi> author. But, whatever country gave it birth, it is filled with a ſacred unction, and "the wiſdom which cometh from above." Read a chapter of it every day, and you will never want a fund of chriſtian meditations.</p>
                     <p>There is more true piety and information, couched in reflexions on the ſeven Days of the Week, by Mrs. Talbot, than you will ſometimes

She is long ſince dead; but her little book will live in the hearts of the pious, when time has tarniſhed all the luſtre of more ſounding names.</p>
                     <p>I have always thought, that little, ſhort trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of this kind have done the moſt extenſive good.

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:023176_0051_0FBDE2D3AED44030"/>Thoughts had likewiſe the misfortune to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, by an early death, of ſeveral of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, from whoſe tender offices and ſoothing attentions, he might naturally have expected, in the evening of a <hi>gloomy</hi> life, to have received <hi>ſome</hi> conſolation. His poems, therefore, have much the ſtrain of elegy, and his piety is breathed in ſighs. But his Night Thoughts have awakened many into ſeriouſneſs, and you muſt take them, as you do all <hi>other,</hi> human things, with their good and their bad.

                     <p>THE meditations of St. Auſtin are admirable, but have ſuffered not a little from the tranſlation. It is, I ſtill repeat it, in theſe <hi>old</hi> books, that we chiefly find the true ſpirit of piety. Has it evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, like ſome <hi>mineral</hi> waters, by a long preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Or is it that we would be men of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and criticiſm, rather than divines? A <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> theologian plays about the <hi>head,</hi> but ſcarcely warms the <hi>heart;</hi> an <hi>ancient</hi> writer carries us, by an irreſiſtible impulſe, into heaven, and fills us with all the raptures of devotion.</p>
                     <p>The difference will be very forcibly illuſtrated by the different conſtruction of ancient and modern churches. The wide magnificence, the luminous darkneſs, the mouldering wells and long drawn aile of gothic ſtructures inſpire us with a pleaſing melancholy, thoughtfulneſs and devotion; whilſt the glaring light, artificial ornaments, primneſs and convenience of our <hi>modern</hi> ſynagogues fill us only with little, <hi>worldly</hi> ideas of elegance and taſte.</p>
                     <p>Beveridge's private thoughts and reſolutions rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerve a place in your collection. They are not animated or elegant, but they are pious and uſeful. He is one of thoſe hoſpitable friends, that gives us a very comfortable and rich repaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremony or oſtentation.</p>
                     <p>Taylor is the Shakeſpeare of divinity. The fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of his invention, the force of his arguments, the richneſs of his images and the copiouſneſs of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023176_0053_0FBDE2D72D8F19E8"/>his ſtyle are not often to be paralleled in the works of ancient or modern writers. His holy living and dying is a <hi>chef d'oeuvre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do not remember to have received more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and improvement from any book, that I have read for ſome time paſt, than from the two firſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of Ganganelli's Letters. Beſides being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſee ſuch a generous mode of thinking in the ſovereign pontiff, ſo much vivacity in a <hi>monk,</hi> tempered with ſo great a ſhare of unaffected piety, I was quite charmed with the ſimplicity of his ſtyle, the beauty of his metaphors, and that ſpirit of philanthropy, which pervades the whole, and does, all along, more honour to his heart, than his eaſy periods, to his underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>There is ſomething in the climate of Italy, which wonderfully heats and ſublimes the imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. It is the garden of Europe, and its writers breathe that agreeable perfume with which it is ſcented. Ganganelli's deſcription of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is particularly ſplendid. His ſtatues breathe. His torrents abſolutely murmur on the ear. His cliffs have an impending horror on the fancy, and his gardens waft upon us aromatic ſmells. I would ſtill gladly hope, notwithſtanding all that has been advanced to the contrary, that theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters really came from this diſtinguiſhed perſon. I am not willing to give up the idea, that liberality of ſentiment has extended itſelf even to the papal throne.</p>

                     <p>YOU would obſerve from the complexion of my laſt letter, that I have recommended writers of very different ſects, and from various denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of chriſtians. The truth is, I have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>tendency,</hi> and not their name or party. I do not want to make you a methodiſt, a diſſenter, a myſtic, a papiſt, a fanatic, an enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt, or any thing but a real chriſtian. I ſhould wiſh to diveſt your mind of every ſpecies of bigotry, and convince you, that real piety <hi>has</hi> exiſted under <hi>every</hi> communion.</p>
                     <p>When your judgment is more matured, you ſhould examine authors of all different perſuaſions, as the Grecian artiſt did women, when he wiſhed to paint his Venus of Medici. He ſelected from every one he ſaw, that <hi>particular</hi> limb or feature, in which they, <hi>ſeparately,</hi> excelled. From one, he borrowed the moſt beautiful eye; from another, an hand; from a third, a boſom, &amp;c. Theſe, by a wonderful effort of genius, he combined into a perfect whole.</p>
                     <p>All ſyſtems, like all human figures, have their defects; but they have, likewiſe, their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Collect theſe, diſtinct charms, and work them up in the crucible of your heart, till they produce "the very beauty of holineſs" in your life and converſation.</p>

Above all, look through all books and forms and ordinances, up to your God. Cheriſh, by every method, a ſpirit of devotion. Set the Lord always before you. Conſider him, as the <hi>ſoul</hi> of the world, the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. Think, act, live, as in his preſence, and do every thing to his glory. Begin, continue and end every day, as in his ſight, and every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as under his direction. Remember that all things on earth are but a ſhadow; that time is tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling down the ſyſtem of the univerſe, and that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion only</hi> can riſe upon the ruins, by the labours it has inſcribed to Eternity and God.</p>

                     <p>THOUGH it may appear to be dealing with you in dry, abſtracted ſubjects above your age, yet I do think it neceſſary, that you ſhould underſtand the grounds, on which your faith is built, or the teſtimony, which confirms the truth of chriſtianity, and of the ſcriptures. You will thus be preſerved from an uncomfortable fluctuation of opinions, and guarded from the falſe inſinuations of thoſe, that lie in wait to deceive.</p>
                     <p>I believe, indeed, we very falſely eſtimate the period, at which the talents of women begin to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023176_0056_0FBDE2DB2E529CB0"/>open, as well as the degree of their extent and comprehenſion, and ſuperciliouſly withhold from you, that ſolid information which, alone in <hi>either</hi> ſex, can be the true foundation of a rational, a ſteady and conſiſtent conduct.</p>
                     <p>This reſtimony in favour of revelation, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, for the ſake of order, into two kinds, <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external.</hi> The internal is that, which ariſes from the nature and excellency of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts <hi>themſelves,</hi> and from the writers having had no <hi>private</hi> or ſiniſter views to anſwer, but conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the <hi>general</hi> good and edification of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>firſt</hi> mark of authenticity is fixed on every page of the ſcriptures. The laws of Chriſt are of ſuch a nature, as no man would have framed, who wiſhed to avail himſelf of the paſſions, prejudices and intereſts of mankind; for they preſcribe, on the other hand, an univerſal humility, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſelf-denial; exhibit, in the ſtrongeſt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, the emptineſs of riches, and the vanity of ambition, and have no other view, but to elevate the affections, regenerate the heart, and put all men on looking beyond the tranſient concerns of this life, to the happineſs of another. What elſe could happen to the original promulgers of theſe laws, but that, which <hi>actually</hi> did, violence and perſecution?</p>
                     <p>Our bleſſed Lord poſitively declared, that his kingdom was not of this world. He ſought none of its diſtinctions, and he feceived none, unleſs, by a ſtrange perverſion of ideas, we place them in the poverty of a manger, or the tortures of his croſs. His <hi>apoſtles</hi> were inflamed with the very ſame, <hi>diſintereſted</hi> zeal. They willingly reſigned
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023176_0057_0FBDE2DCAE13BEF0"/>lucrative employments at the call of their maſter; they cheerfully abandoned weeping friends; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the moſt hazardous voyages and travels; had no reſt day or night, were carried before kings and governors of the earth, "and even hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all men for his name's ſake."</p>
                     <p>Read the account of their labours, perſecution, baniſhment, death; peruſe the hiſtory of all the martyrs, written with their blood, and tell me, whether their zeal muſt not have come from <hi>heaven,</hi> or what could ever have inſpired it, but a ſincere conviction of duty, "a faith, which looked to a city with foundations, whoſe builder and maker was God."</p>

                     <p>THINK, my dear girl, for yourſelf. Are there any marks of ſecular wiſdom or policy or impoſture, in the conduct of the primitive apoſtles and chriſtians? Examine the hiſtory of the whole world, as it relates to religion, and where <hi>elſe</hi> will you diſcover any portion of the ſame, diſintereſted ſpirit, which actuated theſe original publiſhers of the goſpel?</p>
                     <p>The Roman Emperor inſtituted a ſacred code to work upon the conſciences, and to keep the minds of a ſavage and a barbarous people in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to <hi>government.</hi> Zoroaſter, Lycurgus, Solon, all celebrated in their day, and certainly
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023176_0058_0FBDE2DE2F285F58"/>men of extraordinary talents, had more a view to <hi>policy,</hi> than any <hi>moral</hi> intereſts, in their reſpective ſyſtems of legiſlation. Mahomet availed himſelf of the narrow, <hi>ſenſual</hi> views, and paſſions of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and of the particular complexion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions of his times, merely to be the ſole, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive monarch of an extenſive empire, and procure a little fading honor and diſtinction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The kingdom of all <hi>theſe</hi> men was certainly of <hi>this</hi> world,</q> and their laws, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, were repugnant to right reaſon, and the beſt and deareſt intereſts of their fellow creatures. Of Chriſt, his very <hi>enemies</hi> ſaid, "never man ſpake, like this man;" his injunctions had but <hi>one</hi> aſpect—to <hi>univerſul</hi> happineſs, and one, ſimple method to it—univerſal <hi>reformation.</hi> The angels that announced him, at his firſt appearance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed "peace on earth, and good-will towards men."</p>
                     <p>Nor is the wonderful <hi>progreſs</hi> of this religion, in ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> a ſpace of time, over all Aſia, and a great part of Europe, indeed over almoſt the <hi>whole</hi> of the, <hi>then,</hi> known world, the leaſt convincing proof of its divine original. Conſider the <hi>miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries</hi>—illiterate fiſhermen and mechanics, and you muſt conclude, either that they were endowed with <hi>ſupernatural</hi> gifts and aſſiſtance, or that their wonderful <hi>ſucceſs</hi> was even a greater <hi>miracle,</hi> than the endowment, you diſpute.</p>
                     <p>On this ſubject, permit me to recommend to your ſerious peruſal, Soame Jenyn's Internal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Chriſtian Religion. He is, on the whole, a fanciful writer; but this is an excellent, little book, that has done much good, and comes with greater force, to every boſom, as he was
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023176_0059_0FBDE2DFEC571300"/>once, according to his own candid confeſſion, in the number of thoſe, who diſputed the ſacred truths of revelation. You will receive great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and improvement, likewiſe, from Addiſon's Evidences of Chriſtianity, arranged and collected into one volume, and from a late, ſimilar produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the celebrated Dr. Beattie.</p>
                     <p>Every <hi>word</hi> of the ſcriptures, indeed, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any candid or thoughtful perſon, that they come from God. The paſſions, pride vices and intereſts of mankind have induced not a few to ſet up for ſceptics. "Much learning has made them mad," or a little has rendered them <hi>frivolous</hi> and conceited. They have ſought only to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves by uncommon opinions; they have been <hi>dupes</hi> to their own <hi>fancied</hi> penetration; they have attempted to graſp the immenſity of the Deity, in arms of <hi>fleſh,</hi> or have ſhrunk into ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, as a refuge from their vices.</p>
                     <p>Hear what the ſcripture ſaith, <q>Every one, that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved. Except ye become as little children, (humble, docile, tractable,) ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and ſeck not the honour, which cometh of God only!</q>

                     <p>THE <hi>external</hi> teſtimony, in favour of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, ariſes from prophecy, miracles, and the correſponding evidence of hiſtory. And theſe
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023176_0060_0FBDE2E13068DE38"/>ſeem to include all the <hi>probable</hi> methods, which heaven could employ for the converſion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p>The whole ſacred book of the Old Teſtament is, from beginning to end, a clear prediction of the Meſſiah. One of the prophets has foretold the preciſe year, in which this "righteous branch" ſhould make his appearance. And this event, you know, <hi>has</hi> taken place to the comfort of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world.</p>
                     <p>Others have predicted the deſtruction of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Babylon, Tyre, the diſperſion and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Jews, &amp;c. long before they happened;— and all proſane hiſtory, which has been written ſince their time, will inform you, that theſe aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul judgments were wonderfully accompliſhed, in their proper ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>The Revelation contains <hi>darker</hi> hints of ſome events, that are viſibly, though <hi>gradually</hi> fulfilling, at this moment. But as I can only <hi>glance</hi> at the ſubject, you will ſee it treated in ſuch a manner, as to confirm your faith and exait your devotion, in the late Biſhop of Briſtol (Dr. Newton's) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on the Prophecies.</p>
                     <p>The miracles of our Saviour and of his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate apoſtles meet you in every page of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired book; and in <hi>profane</hi> hiſtory, you will learn from thoſe, who were avowed <hi>enemies</hi> to the cauſe, that, at a particular period of time, there <hi>did</hi> exiſt ſuch a ſacred perſonage, as Jeſus Chriſt, who wrought miracles, healed the ſick, and raiſed the dead; ſuch a ſect, as that of Chriſtians, who met to receive the ſacrament, who bound themſelves by <hi>this</hi> oath, to commit no iniquity, practiſed a wonderful innocence and auſterity of manners, and,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023176_0061_0FBDE2E2B0014A98"/>beyond all example, loved one another. You will ſee likewiſe, in the ſame pages, a full deſcription of their manners, morals, ceremonies and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtitutions.</p>
                     <p>The lapſe of time, moreover, to us, who live in theſe <hi>later</hi> times, has given an <hi>additional</hi> force to the evidences, in favour of revelation. The ingenious author of the Spectator, in his day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the particular caſe of the Jews, their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, diſperſion, vagabond, unſettled ſtate, &amp;c. as a ſtanding and inconteſtable <hi>miracle,</hi> in ſupport of the ſacred writings. They <hi>ſtill</hi> continue (what is there ſo circumſtantially foretold,) unable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with any people, and loaded with the hatred and abhorrence of all. The teſtimony, therefore, from <hi>their</hi> hiſtory is proportionably more illuſtrated and confirmed.</p>
                     <p>The deſtruction of the Romiſh church, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, is palpably predicted in the ſcriptures. And, if we may judge from ſtrong appearances, is daily approaching. The great and general diffuſion of knowledge; the conſequent progreſs of religious toleration, and that diſperſion of the miſts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice from all eyes, produced by the genial rays of a meridian ſun, muſt, in time, effect the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of all tyranny and ſuperſtition: whilſt the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, employed in deſtroying monaſteries, and encouraging population, appears an inſtrument in the hand of Providence, for accelerating the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of this auſpicious moment. The late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberment, moreover, of territory from the Holy See; the contentions, in which the ſovereign pontiff has been involved by thoſe monarchs, who <hi>once</hi> trembled at his frown; and the mere <hi>external</hi> deference only, which is paid to his authority,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023176_0062_0FBDE2E42EEF2300"/>prove that his throne is tottering from its baſe, and, like all other human things, approaching to its diſſolution. Thus is our holy religion founded on a rock, againſt which the winds and waves of infidelity beat in vain. Proud men may reaſon, and wicked men pretend to doubt, but <q>the very gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</q>

                     <p>WONDER not at the diverſity of opinions in religion.

                     <p>The hiſtory of the church, from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the preſent, is an hiſtory of theſe diffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. So ſoon as Chriſt and his apoſtles diſappean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, men mixed <q>tares of human opinion with this good ſeed of the word.</q> Even two of theſe apoſtles had a ſharp contention, and the ſpirit has never vaniſhed from their ſucceſſors.</p>
                     <p>There has been the ſame faſhion in religions opinions, as in common things. Particular notions
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023176_0063_0FBDE2E5AC8EEBE0"/>have been abetted, laid aſide, reſumed and diſmiſſed again, under different names and leaders, exactly like the varying modes of dreſs, furniture or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this the leaſt impeachment of our holy religion. The truth of that, like the God, whence it comes, is the "ſame yeſterday, to-day and for ever." It is reſerved, as the privilege of a more glorious era, that all men ſhall be of one <q>heart and of one ſoul and keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all <hi>human</hi> ſyſtems of faith, there muſt be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Where error is <hi>involuntary,</hi> and ſprings from no <hi>criminal</hi> paſſions, but only from a weakneſs or <hi>miſdirection</hi> of judgment, the Almighty, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth chiefly at the heart, doubtleſs will forgive.

                     <p>The chriſtian blood, which has ſtained ſo many ages of the church, has flowed from the moſt <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant</hi> and ſelfiſh paſſions.

                        <hi>Pagan</hi> are thoſe who are wholly unenlightened with revelation, and worſhip <hi>idols,</hi> inſtead of the true God. Theſe idols have been various, as the caprices or imaginations of the people amongſt whom they are found; ſometimes fictitious beings, ſuch as Jupiter, Apollo, Mercury, Mars, Juno, Venus, Minerva, &amp;c. ſometimes, good qualities perſonified; Faith, Hope, Victory, Concord; ſometimes animals, as Serpents, Crocodiles, &amp;c. or even vegetables; as Leek, Onion, Garlic. Theſe laſt were objects of adoration amongſt the Egyptians.</p>
                     <p>Before the appearance of Chriſt, almoſt the whole world was covered with paganiſm. All the learning and politeneſs of Athens and of Rome could not diſpel this ignorance.

                     <p>MAHOMETANS are ſo called from being followers of the great impoſtor, Mahomet. This extraordinary man was born at Mecca, in Arabia, about the middle of the ſixth century; and, in his fortieth year, after ſome time previouſly ſpent in the ſilence, retirement and auſterity of a cave, preſumed to ſtile himſelf, <hi>the Apoſtle of God;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have received from heaven, a new and a <hi>laſt</hi> revelation, which was to illuſtrate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, what had been miſtaken or perverted, in the <hi>chriſtian,</hi> by the lapſe of time or the ſophiſtry of men.

                     <p>DISSENTER is a <hi>vague</hi> word, which, in its full latitude, may be applied to <hi>all,</hi> who differ from the eſtabliſhed religion. <hi>Originally,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it meant only one kind of people, <hi>then</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the name of preſbyterians, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſſented from the <hi>diſcipline</hi> and <hi>polity,</hi> than the <hi>opinions,</hi> of the church. Theſe, in general, embraced the <hi>ſentiments</hi> of Calvin, relating to foreknowledge, divine decrees, irreſiſtible grace, predeſtination, reprobation, &amp;c. They diſclaimed epiſcopacy, and their government was veſted in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:023176_0072_0FBDE2F3300BF8F8"/>preſbyters and ſynods. The word <hi>preſbyter,</hi> means an elder, and <hi>ſynod,</hi> an eccleſiaſtical council or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>preſent</hi> race of diſſenters may be ſtrictly ſubdivided into two claſſes; thoſe who ſtill retain the doctrines of Calvin, and his mode of diſcipline, and call themſelves, from their form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Independants;</hi> and ſuch as aſſume the more ſpecious title of proteſtant diſſenters. The firſt are extremely rigid and puritanical in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deportment; but they do not breathe all the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of piety, not are their annals unſtained with inſtances of intolerance and perſecution.— Their <hi>leader</hi> was a furious and unrelenting bigot. His murder of the poor honeſt Servetus will be an eternal ſtigma on his memory, and throw a dark ſhade over his pretended virtues.</p>
                     <p>Indeed how can people, with <hi>ſuch</hi> ſentiments, act otherwiſe? If <hi>their</hi> God be only merciful to a <hi>few,</hi> elect, how ſhould <hi>they</hi> think of a <hi>general</hi> benevolence? If <hi>he</hi> can be cruel to ſo many <hi>millions</hi> of creatures, where is the harm of imitating <hi>his</hi> example, or <hi>exterminating thouſands?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do not know that the latter kind of diſſenters have any <hi>ſettled</hi> code of faith. <q>Every miniſter has a pſalm of his own, has a doctrine, has an interpretation,</q> ſo that very <hi>oppoſite</hi> ſentiments may be conſiſtently delivered by different perſons, in the ſame pulpit. They value themſelves high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with whatever juſtice, on their learning, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and liberality. Far from being actuated with any blind or <hi>enthuſiaſtic</hi> zeal, they ſeem to <hi>worſhip</hi> reaſon, as their guide, and ſacrilegiouſly exalt it, almoſt on the <hi>ruins</hi> of revelation. <hi>Their</hi> danger is of falling into ſcepticiſm, the moſt alarming and

                        <hi>incurable</hi> of all ſpiritual diſorders. They are ſaid, in general, to diſbelieve the doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of the atonement, and divinity of Chriſt, and unite with the Calviniſts, in <hi>one</hi> ſentiment, at leaſt—that of abhorring epiſcopacy, and of conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering the eſtabliſhed church, as a ſyſtem, raiſed by <hi>prieſtcraft,</hi> and ſupported by <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi>

                     <p>THE methodiſts are <hi>comparatively</hi> a new ſect, and ſprung up about ſixty years ago, under the auſpices of John Weſley, and George Whitfield, then ſtudents at Oxford. They received their name, from affecting to live by a ſtricter regimen and <hi>method,</hi> than other people.</p>
                     <p>They have been long divided into two claſſes according to the different principles, eſpouſed by their leaders. The firſt follow the opinions of Arminius, under the guidance of Weſley, who is <hi>ſtill</hi> a very venerable looking patriarch, at their head; and the other, believing divine decrees, foreknowledge, reprobation and election, are more ſtrictly members of the kirk, (only that they do not admit its diſcipline) having long ſince loſt their <hi>original</hi> director.<note n="*" place="bottom">George Whitfield. Both before and ſince his death, the Counteſs of Huntingdon has been a perſon of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence among this latter claſs of Methodiſts.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do not know, that the methodiſts, (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they, who follow Weſley,) are diſſenters
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023176_0074_0FBDE2F62DBD9C28"/>from the eſtabliſhment, further than in having ſeparate meetings to inkindle and inſpirit the zeal of their followers; a circumſtance, which they conceive to be much neglected by the <hi>regular</hi> cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. They are baptized with <hi>us;</hi> attend our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and ſacrament; admire our liturgy; and only blame us for our lukewarmneſs and want of ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and animation. This cenſure, it is true, comes but with a very ill grace from ſuch a people; but, I fear, we cannot eaſily refute it.</p>
                     <p>They had <hi>originally</hi> a great ſhare of <hi>enthuſiaſm.</hi>— But it is greatly ſoftened by the indulgence they have received, and mellowed down by time. They are no longer, a new; they are no longer a <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted</hi> ſect.</p>
                     <p>The journals of Weſley, written in the infancy of his career, are a ſtrange medley of goodneſs and enthuſiaſm. The old man has lived long enough to have ſeen his error. That glow of imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is conſiderably abated, which miſtook ſhadows for ſubſtance, and made fiction paſs for truth.</p>
                     <p>The great error amongſt this people, is their employing ſuch low, illiterate men as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors, and fancying them under the <hi>immediate</hi> guidance of divine inſpiration—preaching up the neceſſity of <hi>inſtantaneous</hi> converſion and juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a ſort of <hi>miracle</hi>—making faith to conſiſt in a <hi>full aſſurance</hi> of ſalvation, and denouncing dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt thoſe, who have it not in this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent degree—and laſtly, in ſuppoſing this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to depend on certain, <hi>inward extraordinary</hi> impulſes, rather than the ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſentiments lead many <hi>artful</hi> people into a wicked pretence of feelings and aſſurances, which they <hi>have not;</hi> others of <hi>warm imagination</hi>

                     <p>The Saviour, doubtleſs, can forgive ſins to <hi>whom,</hi> and at <hi>whatever moment,</hi> he pleaſes. A thief, upon the croſs, was a <hi>miracle</hi> of his mercy; but this is not the <hi>ordinary</hi> method of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; there are, undoubtedly, thouſands of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent people, who paſs through the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a full <hi>aſſurance</hi> of faith; and the ſpiritual life, like that of animals or vegetables, is <hi>generally</hi> progreſſive. We grow imperceptibly "from ſtrength to ſtrength," and, though the peace of God may be diffuſed through our conſciences, we <hi>dare</hi> not ſay, "that we have already attained."</p>
                     <p>The methodiſts were, <hi>once,</hi> extremely laviſh in their cenſures of others; but juſtice obliges me to confeſs, that they are now in general, an harmleſs, inoffenſive and pious people. If they be <hi>gloomy,</hi> it is their <hi>own</hi> misfortune; if they go mourning all their days, <hi>theirs</hi> is the ſorrow; the world in general, is too diſſipated and unreflecting.</p>
                     <p>As to their leader, he is doubtleſs a prodigy.— Whatever be the merit or demerit of his opinions, his indefatigable labours, activity, pilgrimages, zeal, and reſolution challenge our amazement. An old man of nearly ninety riſing conſtantly at four o'clock in the depth of winter, preaching <hi>frequently,</hi> on the ſame day, journeying from place to place, <q>and from one people to another kindom;</q> himſelf the biſhop, ſecretary, judge, governor of his people, the main ſpring of ſuch a vaſt, and <hi>complicated</hi> machine, is a phenomenon, that will vaniſh from our earthly horizon, when he ceaſes to exiſt. His opinions, it is ſaid, do not
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023176_0076_0FBDE2F9EC738C10"/>injure his <hi>cheerfulneſs.</hi> Time has planted few wrinkles on his forehead, though it has covered his head with ſnow.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the religious zeal, which works wonders in his favour, and the deference natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid to the <hi>firſt founder</hi> of a ſect, particularly when poſſeſſed of any genius or learning, yet his <hi>peaceful</hi> government of ſo numerous a people, for ſuch a length of time, is a proof of extraordinary talents and addreſs. Whenever he dies, his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will dwindle. They will not eaſily agree about a ſucceſſor. No ſucceſſor can have ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed a ſovereignty, or poſſeſs ſo unmoleſted a throne. They will ſeparate from the church; and the ſeparation will be fatal. It will be the loſs of union, conſequence and power. The <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public</hi> will probably be divided in its councils, and have leſs diſpatch and energy in the execution.</p>

                     <p>THE Moravians, or the <hi>brethren,</hi> are a ſpecies of proteſtants, who, in the fifteenth century, threw off the deſpotic yoke of Rome, animated by the zealous exhortations and heroic example of John Muſs<note n="*" place="bottom">John Muſs and Jerom of Prague, ſuffered martyrdom at Prague, in the year 1414.</note> Count Zinzendorff was a very eminent leader of this ſect, and, for his ſignal ſervices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, has been diſtinguiſhed by the name of Papa<note n="†" place="bottom">This was rather an appellation, which very naturally was uſed in the familiar circle of his family.

                     <p>They have more than once paſſed through the fiery ordeal of perſecution. Their religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, however, are ſound and orthodox. At a period, when great clamours were raiſed againſt them, Potter, the then learned Archbiſhop of
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023176_0079_0FBDE2FE6C494F90"/>Canterbury, pronounced them a proteſtant, epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal community, as they retained no doctrines that were repugnant to the articles of the church of England; and the pious biſhop of Sodor and Man (Wilſon) was created an honorary preſident of (what is called) the reformed <hi>Tropus,</hi> in the <hi>Unitas fratrum,</hi> (the unity of the brethren.)</p>
                     <p>Their diſcipline and mode of government are very ſingular. They form within themſelves a religious community, independent of every other, and extending to all their brethren throughout the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The morals and chaſtity of their <hi>women</hi> are guarded with a very peculiar vigilance; they are not permitted to ſtep without the walls of their aſylum, unaccompanied by a ſuperintendent of their own ſex<note n="†" place="bottom">The author's aſſertion is to be underſtood only of the growing youth of the ſex, who are not of age.</note>: when any of them, or the brethren

                     <p>There are many ſcattered ſocieties of Moravians in England, but they appear to be a declining ſect.

Sometimes they are called quietiſts, becauſe they maintain, that the ſoul ſhould be in a ſtill, <hi>quiet,</hi> paſſive ſtate, undiſtracted with noiſe and cares, and almoſt ſuperior to ſenſe or matter, in order to receive this divine illumination.— Their ſtation, in the thermometer of different, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders, in that of lighter elements, carried by ſuperior ſubtilty into the air, whilſt others, compoſed of groſſer matter, adhere, by an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible neceſſity, to the earth, till death diſſolves the union betwixt ſoul and body.</p>
                     <p>The myſtic theology ſeems to be the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of <hi>Plato,</hi> refined and grafted upon a Chriſtian ſtock; the <hi>quixotiſm</hi> of religion, which affects to attain in <hi>life,</hi> what the ſcriptures have taught us to expect only after <hi>death;</hi> an intimate knowledge of the Almighty, viſions, revelations, almoſt <hi>intuition!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the myſtics would reaſon for a moment, (but people, under the guidance of immediate illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are far above the <hi>vulgar</hi> ſhackles of <hi>reaſon,</hi>) they would ſee that ſuch a ſubtile, metaphyſical ſyſtem is poorly fitted for the reception of mankind

They would know, that their opinions muſt create an indifference, or a fancied <hi>ſuperiority</hi> to thoſe eſtabliſhed ordinances, which are the very baſis of all religion, and that if <hi>all</hi> men were governed by their paſſive <hi>quietude,</hi> there would be none to encounter with the vices and diſorders of a mixed, heterogenous ſtate.— Chriſtians would "ceaſe to be the light of the world, or the ſalt of the earth;" there would be none to ſtem, by powerful, <hi>turbid</hi> eloquence the ragings of iniquity, or let the luſtre of their example ſhine before men."</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Lord</hi>'s piety was not of this kind. It ſought not the indulgence of recluſe contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <p>THE myſtic theology boaſts ſome great names. Madame de Guion was a warm eſpouſer of it in France; a woman of great faſhion and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, remarkable for the goodneſs of her heart, and the regularity of her conduct, but of a capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unſettled temper, and liable to the ſeductions of a warm imagination.</p>
                     <p>The opinions of this lady made a great noiſe in that country, about the year 1687. They were confuted, ſome time afterwards, by the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Boſſuet. The great and good Fenelon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her vindication; but his book was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Pope Innocent the twelfth.</p>
                     <p>The Teutonic philoſopher (Jacob Behemen,) was a kind of father to this ſect, and publiſhed a book, which contains a ſyſtem of the moſt abſurd and incoherent reveries, that perhaps ever gained an admiſſion into the world. It is a ſpecies of moral chymiſtry, and occult philoſophy, a bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering explanation, and a cloudy light, which I will venture to ſay, that neither Sir Iſaac Newton, nor Mr. Locke, with all their clearneſs of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could have been able to underſtand.</p>
                     <p>Law, who wrote the Serious Call (a nonjuror of Northamptonſhire), was an abettor of theſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines; a man of very exemplary life, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating talents; but it was an honour, reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the late Baron Swedenborg to carry them to their very height of perfection<note n="†" place="bottom">Thoſe who embrace the tenets of Baron Swedenborg, have very lately begun to form themſelves into a ſeparate connexion, under the name of the New Jeruſalem Church.</note>.

                        <hi>his,</hi> all other writings, on the ſubject, are but the morning contraſted with the perfect day. He tells us <hi>confidently</hi> of his unreſtrained communications with the ſpiritual world, viſions, revelations; he gives to every portion of ſcripture, a natural, a ſpiritual, and a celeſtial ſenſe; he deſcribes to us the very form, and furniture, and apparatus of heaven; he retails to the reader his converſations with <hi>angels;</hi> he deſcribes the condition of Jews, Mahometans, Chriſtians, of the Engliſh, French, Dutch, of clergymen of every denomination, lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c. in another world; he has a key to unlock all the hitherto impenetrable ſecrets of futurity, and already, whilſt in the body, "knows even as he is known."</p>
                     <p>What is the inference? When <hi>imagination</hi> is permitted to uſurp the place of <hi>reaſon,</hi> fanaticiſm becomes a chriſtian duty, and enthuſiaſm the more <hi>credible,</hi> in proportion as it exceeds all bounds of <hi>credibility.</hi>

                     <p>What can induce men of <hi>ſenſe</hi> to hearken to theſe dreams? Early prejudices, confined reading, ſingular acquaintance, a recluſe life, a gloomy. ſpeculative, abſtracted turn of mind, and aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, for a long time, particular, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>incongruous,</hi> ideas.</p>
                     <p>This will account for <hi>any</hi> reveries. It accounts for <hi>inſanity.</hi> And men, from this cauſe, may, in a <hi>particular</hi> inſtance (ſuppoſe religion), be inſane, though in all <hi>other</hi> reſpects, their minds are ever ſo enlightened, or ever ſo expanſive.</p>
                     <p>It muſt, however, be ſaid in favour of the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, that their principles inculcate in the ſtrongeſt manner, the neceſſity of ſpiritual holineſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; that their lives in general, are
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023176_0086_0FBDE30923ECF1F8"/>unblemiſhed and exemplary. They are a quiet, retired people, who let the world go as it <hi>will,</hi> as to riches or promotions; who enjoy indeed, in a paſſive <hi>ſuperiority,</hi> thoſe tumults of the crowd, as higher ſpirits may <hi>condeſcend</hi> to look down, with a pitying ſmile, on the toils of mortals; and who deny themſelves all the gayer pleaſures, in order to reliſh, in a ſublimer degree, all the raptures of devotion.</p>
                     <p>If the opinions of the quietiſts ſpring from ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pride, it is more than they ſuſpect; for they preach up the deepeſt ſelf-abaſement, anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, and poverty of ſpirit; they almoſt ſtarve the <hi>animal</hi> part of their nature, to nurſe the <hi>angelic,</hi> and half <hi>live</hi> on meditation.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch people have errors, they ſhould be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a gentle hand. If they are miſled, it is in <hi>amiable</hi> company. There is not a much more lovely name than that of Fenelon. Few men have poſſeſſed ſuch a ſweetneſs of piety.</p>
                     <p>I have but one wiſh for them, myſelf, or any other ſect, and it is a wiſh of charity; that what is wrong in <hi>any of us,</hi> may be done away, becauſe I long to meet them all in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

The term, at preſent, is indiſcriminately applied to all, who, in any degree, embrace this opinion.</p>

                     <p>THE Deiſts are ſo called, perhaps, from the Latin word, <hi>Deus,</hi> a God; becauſe they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only the exiſtence of a God, profeſs no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form or ſyſtem of religion, and only follow the law and light of nature. Of theſe, however, there are many <hi>degrees,</hi> from the moderate ones, who believe revelation in a certain, <hi>qualified</hi> ſenſe,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:023176_0088_0FBDE30BF399E278"/>to thoſe, who abſolutely diſavow it in <hi>all.</hi> The firſt who figured or wrote, in this country, was Baron Herbert of Cherbury.</p>
                     <p>Deiſm is <hi>generally</hi> embraced, either by men of a cold, phlegmatic, philoſophical caſt, who are indiſpoſed to believe any thing, for which they have not abſolute demonſtration, or by thoſe, who, having never thought or reaſoned, conſider it as a mark of wit and talents, to ſet up for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers.</p>
                     <p>The firſt deſerve an anſwer, and it is eaſy. All <hi>nature</hi> is full of myſteries, as well as revelation; the union of ſoul and body is a <hi>miracle;</hi> the infinite diviſibility of matter, and the idea of an <hi>eternal</hi> duration are abſolutely incomprehenſible; nothing can be more ſo, than the neceſſary <hi>ſelf-exiſtence</hi> of God. The latter are better anſwered with irony. Their infidelity is a faſhionable <hi>livery.</hi> When deiſm is not in vogue amongſt the gay cireles, they will ſoon put it off, and diſavow their ever having worn ſo abſolete a garb.</p>
                     <p>A third claſs of deiſts may be ſaid to ſpring up from the ſuperſtitions of Rome. Great men, who live in catholic countries, are diſguſted with their bigotry, and are apt to think religion in <hi>general</hi> only an <hi>impoſition</hi> on the credulity of mankind. Was not this the caſe with all that ſplendid group, Rouſſeau, Voltaire, the Abbe de Raynal, and Helvetius, who wrote a famous treatiſe <hi>de l' Eſprit?</hi> Genius hates ſhackles, and ſhackles are the <hi>peculiar</hi> manufacture of Rome.</p>
                     <p>A fourth claſs of deiſts are continually produced by the love of fame, venting itſelf in paradoxes, and ſingular opinions to make a noiſe; by an averſion to the ſtrictneſs of goſpel morality, and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:023176_0089_0FBDE30D6D0D4788"/>by criminal paſſions, which endeavour to hide their guilt in the ſhades of unbelief. Some of theſe have commenced authors, and endeavoured to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalize their errors by the preſs.

Whilſt we are in <hi>this</hi> world, enemies will mix theſe <hi>tares</hi> with the good ſeed of the goſpel. We muſt wait till <hi>harveſt,</hi> to ſee the final ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>The deiſts are the greateſt enemies, of all others, to true religion. Their pride and ſcepticiſm ſtop up every avenue, by which divine grace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction ſhould be conveyed to the ſoul. Nature, with <hi>them,</hi> is only a <hi>neceſſary</hi> ſyſtem of cauſes and effects. Creation roſe into its preſent ſplendour, by a kind of <hi>fatality.</hi> Thunders roar, lightnings flaſh, volcanos vomit, tempeſts rage, ſeas overflow, millions periſh, and kingdoms are deſolated, only by a train of <hi>ſtated,</hi> inevitable cauſes. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a <hi>firſt</hi> efficient mover, and think not of the providence, which, at a certain moment, and for the wiſeſt, <hi>moral</hi> cauſes, predeſtined ſuch events.</p>
                     <p>Few of theſe men have <hi>died</hi> in peace. Their fortitude has deſerted them, when they wanted its ſupport. Their philoſophy has vaniſhed, as their ſtrength has abated.

                     <p>TRAVELLERS, that have made (what is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) the grand tour, felicitate themſelves on their return to England, and pronounce it the happieſt country in the world. And ſuch it certainly is, if not in beauty and deliciouſneſs of climate, yet in that abſolute <hi>ſecurity</hi> of property it enjoys above all other nations, and that <hi>liberty,</hi> which endears eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>If you have made proper obſervations on the different, religious ſects, that have paſſed in review before us, you will feel much the ſame ſentiment, when you compare them with your own church.— You will be the <hi>moral</hi> traveller returned from more unpleaſant ſcenes, to taſte the bleſſings of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and dignity at home. Nor is this idea, I hope, the effect of prejudice, but ſprings from ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and conviction.</p>
                     <p>The Church of England<note n="*" place="bottom">The Church of England, together with the eſtabliſhed Church of Ireland, forms only one of the three leading diviſions of the Proteſtants. <hi>Lutheraniſm</hi> is the eſtabliſhed religion in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Livonia, and a conſiderable part of Germany; and <hi>Calviniſm</hi> or <hi>Preſbyter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023176_0091_0FBDE3106BDEF118"/>offend the delicacy of the ſublimeſt underſtanding. It aims not at the <hi>total</hi> abſtraction of diſſenters, nor affects the ſuperſtitious forms and ceremonies of the Church of Rome. Its piety has a rational, ſedate, compoſed air, and is uniformly grave and decent without pretending to the flights, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and the viſions of ſome, <hi>modern</hi> fanatics.</p>
                     <p>The ſacraments are not ridiculouſly multiplied, nor has <hi>human</hi> policy inveated them. They are but two in number, baptiſm and the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; both poſitively enjoined by Chriſt, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ſuppoſed to have any further merit, than as they lead to purity of heart and conduct. The <hi>liturgy</hi> has been admired by the greateſt men; the miniſters of this church are, in general, an ornament to their ſacred profeſſion, and perhaps, on the whole, men of as great learning, candour, piety and moderation, as are to be found under any communion. That there were no <hi>exceptions,</hi> would be a <hi>miracle.</hi> There was a Judas amongſt twelve apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>After all the <hi>fine-ſpun</hi> theories of liberty, every ſociety muſt have a mode of government; and that government ſuppoſes power to be lodged <hi>ſome where</hi> for the general good. That of the Church of England is veſted in biſhops; no one will diſpute the <hi>antiquity,</hi> or perhaps uſefulneſs of the order, whatever he may object to its temporal diſtinctions. St. Paul appointed biſhops in the primitive church.</p>
                     <p>Much abuſe is often levelled againſt the ſacred bench. But the ſhafts come from <hi>envy,</hi> and are pointed by religious prejudice and reſentment. It is, in fact, their <hi>temporal</hi> emoluments, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke this ungenerous kind of perſecution. But if they muſt attend <hi>parliament,</hi> they have indeed no
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:023176_0092_0FBDE312486BB748"/>
                        <hi>ſuper-abundant</hi> proviſion. Whilſt it is thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to have a <hi>national</hi> church, the intereſts of it, as connected with the ſtate, muſt frequently be a ſubject of parliamentary diſcuſſion; and it would be very extraordinary indeed, if they, who are moſt <hi>immediately</hi> concerned ſhould not have the liberty of giving their opinion and <hi>votes</hi> on the occaſion. Whatever <hi>equal</hi> right, from education or abilities, the biſhops may poſſeſs, along with the <hi>temporal</hi> peers of the realm, to deliver their ſentiments on any <hi>other</hi> ſubject, they exerciſe it very <hi>rarely,</hi> and with great <hi>diſcretion.</hi> Their hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours too, it ſhould be obſerved, uſually come late in life, and the hope of attaining them, at ſome <hi>diſtant</hi> period, is doubtleſs, amongſt the younger clergy, a ſtrong incentive to emulation.</p>
                     <p>But prejudice apart, the biſhops, in general, perform their ſacred duties with great decorum, and the preſent bench can boaſt the names of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral who, without the aid of purple, would be an ornament to human nature.</p>
                     <p>To ſuppoſe the Church of England without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, would be ſuppoſing it not an <hi>human</hi> eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But innovation in religious ſyſtems, is a <hi>dangerous</hi> experiment Projects of a reformation in our liturgy and articles have come from very ſuſpicious quarters, and worn no very prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſing appearance.

<pb n="84" facs="unknown:023176_0093_0FBDE3136D06E2D0"/>very great attachment to the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of our holy faith.</p>
                     <p>We might, perhaps, borrow from <hi>ſectaries,</hi> without any inconvenience, a little more <hi>zeal,</hi> fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and animation. If our <hi>internal</hi> diſcipline, like theirs, was more rigidly inforced, and if, like them, we had a few more conferences with our people, and an opportunity of keeping the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy from the altar, we ſhould be ſo much nearer the model of perfection.</p>
                     <p>But alas! the <hi>great</hi> evil amongſt us, is a want of <hi>encouragement.</hi> The church, at any rate, has but a ſmall pittance. A learned prelate<note n="*" place="bottom">The B—p of L—d—ff.</note> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that, if all its dignities, (biſhopricks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,) were annulled, and their produce thrown into one common, equalizing fund, for the <hi>general</hi> ſupport, the amount of annual ſalary, to every <hi>individual</hi> would not exceed £. 120, or at moſt, £. 150.</p>
                     <p>Under ſuch circumſtances, who can be very animated? Or what energy can attend the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our profeſſion in the eyes of a world, that ſuperciliouſly appreciates the characters of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more by their temporal poſſeſſions, than by the graces of their heart, or the ſublimity of their underſtanding. To a perſon of any refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſenſibility, houſes without conveniences, and children, without proviſion, are but a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy portion! If <hi>merchants</hi> or <hi>lawyers</hi> had no better proſpects, what would be <hi>their</hi> exertions? And yet under all this heavy load of embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what great and good men do our annals boaſt?</p>

But neither thoſe viſionaries nor this philoſopher have been able to change the nature of things; to take from nerves, their ſenſibility; from the world, its inſolence, from education, its delicacy, or from poverty, its ſtings.</p>

                     <p>BOOKS and rules of all kinds are the <hi>theory</hi> of religion, and can have no further uſe, than as they lead to <hi>practice.</hi> We have <hi>then</hi> profited by ſyſtems and opinions, when our life is a continual <hi>comment</hi> on what we have read, and we make the light of our example ſhine before men.</p>
                     <p>Chriſtianity has but two, capital features; love to God, evidenced in acts of piety; and good will towards man, exemplified in all the poſſibilities of doing good. As devotion, however neceſſary, can bring no profit to our Maker, any more than a little taper can add to the ſplendors of the ſun, the ſcriptures have laid the greateſt ſtreſs on charity to our <hi>fellow-creatures.</hi> This is called the <q>end
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023176_0095_0FBDE3166C4A6100"/>of the commandment;</q> it is the <hi>embodying</hi> of our piety; and the world could not ſubſiſt without it. Human life is full of woe. Charity is the <hi>angel,</hi> that binds up the ſores of our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, heals the broken in heart, clothes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and feeds the hungry. The poor are made the repreſentatives of Chriſt; whatever we give to <hi>them</hi> is, in ſcripture language, beſtowed on the <hi>Saviour.</hi> Moth and ruſt corrupt the treaſures we hoard up, but this is placed in thoſe funds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which never fail.</p>
                     <p>The Saviour has ſaid, that <q>it is more bleſſed to give than to receive.</q> And the pleaſures, which ſpring from charity, prove its origin to be divine. What value has an heap of money, or what conſcious dignity do we derive from it, if it is not employed in giving comfort to the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and protection to the diſtreſſed?</p>
                     <p>The very <hi>poor</hi> are provided for by the laws of the kingdom. And <hi>common</hi> beggars are far from being the moſt deſerving objects. Charity ſhould rather ſeek out the modeſt and uncomplaining who have ſeen better days, and have all the pains of a delicate ſenſibility, annexed to their diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>True charity does not ſo much conſiſt in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying little alms to a number of poor people, as in making ſome grand and well directed efforts in favour of a few. Educating one child of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened family is a greater act of beneficence, than <hi>retailing</hi> to them, occaſionally, a thouſand, <hi>petty</hi> benefactions. It is not a few, ſcattered drops of rain, but it is a generous ſhower, coming all at once, which revives the parched earth, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens vegetation.</p>

                     <p>I do not know a better practice, than that of the primitive chriſtians—laying by, on the firſt day of the week, a little pittance for this purpoſe.— Theſe drops will not be miſſed from the general reſervoir, and yet, <hi>collectively,</hi> will rain a ſhower of bleſſings on many indigent and diſtreſſed.</p>

                     <p>YOUNG ladies have many methods of charity beſides the mere act of giving <hi>money.</hi> That time, which ſometimes hangs heavy on their hands, might be uſefully employed in making garments for the naked, or providing cordials for the ſick. Such an active benevolence would likewiſe be an excellent recipe for their health and ſpirits; it would dignify their character, and when the <hi>laſt</hi> moment came, gratitude would <q>ſhew the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which a Dorcas had made,</q> and the good name <q>they had acquired, would be infinitely richer, and more precious than ointment.</q>

                     <p>If I wiſhed a woman to be <hi>univerſally</hi> charming, I would recommend this expedient. Compaſſion is the higheſt excellence of your ſex, and charity
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:023176_0097_0FBDE1186627CE98"/>is the ſacred root from which it ſprings. The ſoft boſom of a woman, throbbing with ſympathy, or her eye gliſtening with cryſtal drops of pity, are ſome of the fineſt touches in nature's pencil. The whole train of accompliſhments, the whole group of graces do not exalt her half ſo much in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the worthy, the amiable and the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Alas! when death comes, what will be all the accompliſhments and graces? But <hi>charity</hi> ſhall never fail; its pleaſures <hi>then</hi> are gaining their meridian of perfection.

Nature has been ſufficiently kind to her <hi>perſon;</hi> but it is not her ſweet complexion, it is not her flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unartificial ringlets, it is not the <hi>ſoftneſs</hi> of her voice and manner, or the <hi>mild</hi> luſtre of her eyes, that would have called forth a penegyric from my pen, or touched a breaſt, that is conſiderably petrified with philoſophy and reflection. It is a conviction that ſhe lives in the conſtant exerciſe of <hi>piety;</hi> that her excellencies are chiefly thoſe of the <hi>mind,</hi> and that her benevolence is bounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by creation.</p>
                     <p>When others are at plays or aſſemblies, <hi>her</hi> fair hands are making garments for the naked, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoratives for the ſick. The ingenuity, which ſome of her ſiſter females employ to adorn <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> is conſecrated by <hi>her,</hi> to the ſervice of the poor.</p>
                     <p>This is laying up in ſtore againſt the day of neceſſity. This is weaving for herſelf a chaplet
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:023176_0098_0FBDE119E87D7698"/>of laurels, that ſhall be green in age. Her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhall ſmile even in diſſolution.

                        <salute>MY DEAR LUCY,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THE very firſt thing I ſhould recommend after religious duties, as abſolutely eſſential to your private comfort, is <hi>ſelf-government</hi> in the fulleſt ſenſe of the word. This may be ſuppoſed to be included under the article of religion. And ſo in fact it is. But there are many well diſpoſed people, that ſeem to think little things of this kind almoſt beneath their notice, though in reality they are interwoven with the repoſe of every day, and almoſt every moment.</p>
                     <p>The diſcipline of the <hi>imagination</hi> is the firſt thing to be attempted. This, in young people, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally warm; and if they are not cautious, will be apt to miſlead them into very dangerous errors.</p>
                     <p>Thus whatever captivates their <hi>fancy,</hi> they take, without examination, to be all over excellence. Tinſel, becauſe it <hi>glitters</hi> more, will be preferred to ſolid <hi>gold;</hi> a luxuriant, florid ſtyle in a writer; to the ſoundeſt and beſt arranged arguments; the ſhewy and brilliant in <hi>characters,</hi> to the truly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, and the gaudy in <hi>dreſs,</hi> to that artleſs ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, which is the offspring of an elegant and well cultivated taſte.</p>
                     <p>Young people, almoſt univerſally ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this kind of <hi>illuſion.</hi> They enter upon life, as an <hi>inchanted</hi> country. The world, in

                        <hi>their</hi> idea, has no caprice; fortune, no viciſſitude; friendſhip is without ſincerity; attachment without bitters, and marriage is all happineſs without allay. What the ſcripture has called a <hi>wilderneſs, they</hi> make a <hi>paradiſe,</hi> whoſe landſkips are deliciouſly pictureſque, and whoſe ſpring is ever green.</p>
                     <p>Experience, be aſſured, will not realize ſuch high expectations. You will find, that every object has its imperfections; that the world at beſt is but a mixture of good and ill, and that the lights of the picture will be interſperſed with ſhades.</p>

Nor have we much imbibed the true ſpirit of the goſpel, if it has not taught us to bear patiently the imperfections of our fellow-creatures, and to temper authority with gentleneſs and good nature.</p>
                     <p>No <hi>Conſequence</hi> can juſtify one ſingle act of <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price,</hi> ſullenneſs or ill-humour.

                     <p>Tyranny is a downright inſult to any creature formed in the image of God; it would be unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, if exerciſed even to a worm or inſect, and generally proceeds from cauſes, which reflect no honour on the heart or underſtanding. It is often the reſult of a <hi>new-born</hi> greatneſs, that has not yet learned how to bear ſuperiority; of a ſpleen, collected from want of employment, or a <hi>natural,</hi> ill temper, that never has ſubmitted to the diſcipline of virtue.</p>

                        <hi>Mildneſs</hi> is neceſſary to <hi>our own</hi> comfort.

                     <p>It is a pitiful condeſcenſion in a woman of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to aggravate every little cauſe of complaint. A ruffled, angry, ſcolding woman is ſo far <hi>vulgar</hi> and diſguſting, and, for the moment, a ſort of <hi>virage.</hi>

                        <hi>Learned</hi> women, however, have been often a proverb of reproach, feared by their own ſex, and diſliked by ours.

The truth is, ſome females have been <hi>viragos</hi> in their knowledge, not only injudicious in the <hi>kind</hi> they have aſpired to, but the <hi>uſe</hi> they have made of it, and an <hi>indiſcriminate</hi> ſtigma has been fixed upon all, who have endeavoured <hi>rationally</hi> to improve their underſtandings.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, it is ſaid of women, that they are ſo ignorant, frivolus and inſipid, as to be unfit for friendſhip, ſociety or converſation; that they are unable to amuſe, entertain or edify a lonely hour, much more to bleſs or grace that connexion, for which they were principally formed.</p>
                     <p>What, my dear girl, can a <hi>judicious</hi> woman do, in ſuch a dilemma? How muſt ſhe act to avoid the imputation of pedantry on the one hand, and ignorance on the other.</p>
                     <p>There is a narrow, <hi>middle</hi> path betwixt theſe extremes. Judgment muſt point it out, and good ſenſe direct you in the execution.</p>
                     <p>The prominent excellencies of your minds are taſte and imagination, and your knowledge ſhould be of a kind, which <hi>aſſimilates</hi> with theſe faculties. Politics, philoſophy, mathematics, or metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics are not <hi>your</hi> province. Machiavel, Newton, Euclid, Malebranche or Locke would lie with a very ill grace in your cloſets. They would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you <hi>unwomanly</hi> indeed. They would damp that vivacity and deſtroy that diſengaged eaſe and <hi>ſoftneſs,</hi> which are the very <hi>eſſence</hi> of your graces.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>elegant</hi> ſtudies are, more immediately, <hi>your</hi> department. They do not require ſo much time, abſtraction or comprehenſiveneſs of mind; they bring no wrinkles, and they will give a poliſh to your manners, and ſuch a liberal expanſion to

                     <p>Hume is by no means, an <hi>impartial</hi> hiſtorian, but he is a very ſplendid, captivating writer. If he is not diſpaſſionate, he is always inchanting; and, if he does not uniformly convince, he never fails to charm.</p>
                     <p>It had been happy for this writer, if he had never attempted any thing but <hi>hiſtory.</hi> He might then have gone to his grave with unequivocal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. But in his moral and metaphyſical works, he is an enemy to the deareſt intereſts of mankind. He has endeavoured to ſap the foundations of that religion, which is the only ſource of every hope and every comfort. His cold and <hi>ſullen</hi> ſcepticiſm has done infinite miſchief. It more than ſullies all the luſtre of his literary fame.</p>

                     <p>ROBERTSON's hiſtory of Charles the fifth, and of Mary Queen of Scots, will both inſtruct and entertain you. The hiſtoriographer has been eſteemed an excellent writer. But I have always, in private, thought his ſtyle too laboured and ſtately. It has not the eaſe and ſimplicity of the ancients. It does not equal ſeveral of the moderns. It has neither the conciſe energy of Hume, nor the more flowing and eaſy graces of Gibbon.</p>

The late Dr. Stewart, in a very elegant work, has controverted almoſt all the aſſertions of his predeceſſor, concerning Mary, and become the champion of this unfortunate queen. But <hi>you</hi> have nothing to do with literary controverſy. Leave them to the tribunal of an impartial public. <hi>Time</hi> will weight their ſeparate merits in the balance of truth. Either or both of them will exerciſe your taſte, and improve your underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Stretch's Beauties of Hiſtory<note n="*" place="bottom">A new Edition of which has lately been publiſhed in Dublin, in 2 vols. Price 6<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>
                        </note> will furniſh you with many ſhort, agreeable anecdotes, both anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern, at a very ſmall expence of time and trouble. Knowledge thus <hi>epitomized,</hi> is what I ſhould recommend. On ſuch ſubjects, you want ſhort and pithy ſketches, rather than laboured and prolix diſſertations.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of Greece and Rome is ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alluded to, ſo connected with that of almoſt all other nations, and ſo full of curious incidents and anecdotes, that a little knowledge of it would be very uſeful and entertaining. But, in general, the writers on the ſubject are too voluminous for a <hi>female.</hi> They make up no little ſhare of the labour, in a claſſical education. Goldſmith has likewiſe given his aſſiſtance to epitomize this branch of hiſtory. I know no other writer ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for your purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>To attain juſt a <hi>glimpſe</hi> of general hiſtory, the moſt uſeful work I recollect, is the Abbé Millot's <hi>Elements ſur l'Hiſtoire.</hi> On <hi>his</hi> comprehenſive and condenſed plan, there is much in a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. By travelling over a few fields, you gain a moſt immenſe and extended horizon, and many
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023176_0113_0FBDE13063FC6700"/>tracts of <hi>hitherto</hi> undiſcovered country. Hiſtory at large is ſo voluminous and complicated, that, to a young lady, who ſhould underſtand, as it were, but the <hi>outline,</hi> it very much wants ſuch a mode of abridgment, and <hi>ſimplification.</hi>

                     <p>THOUGH I think every woman in the world ſhould execrate the memory of the late Lord Cheſterfield, as having written the moſt ſcandalous libels on her ſex, yet his ſketches of heathen my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology, of Grecian, Roman, and Britiſh hiſtory, in the firſt volume of his letters, are well worth your attention. If this ingenious nobleman had given us more ſpecimens of <hi>this</hi> nature, and fewer lectures on <hi>the graces</hi> and <hi>intrigue,</hi> the gratitude of poſterity would have <hi>imbalmed</hi> his aſhes.

                     <p>Though a good ſtyle is, doubtleſs, a mark of genius, and not attainable by every perſon, yet it depends amazingly on <hi>mechanical</hi> habit, as well as our gait, countenance or geſture.

                     <p>THAT ſpecies of hiſtory, which deſcribes the lives and characters of particular perſons, and is included under the name of biography, is by fat the moſt uſeful and intereſting to a woman.

                     <p>I have always thought that one great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of boys over girls, is their having the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious characters of antiquity to form their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and fire their emulation.

It has not that turgid pompoſity of ſtyle, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in ſome of his more juvenile labours; it is, all along, interſperſed with judicious ſentiments and moral reflections; it abounds with an original vein of criticiſm, and anecdotes of ſo many illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious men, as cannot fail to amuſe, as well as to inſtruct.

                     <p>The Marquis Caraccioli is univerſally known, as an author of great vivacity and talents. He has written the life of Pope Clement XIV. and it does honour to his pen, as well as to the memory of the ſovereign pontiff.</p>

                     <p>WRAXALL is a very agreeable author, and he has choſen a fruitful, happy ſubject, in his Memoirs of the Kings of France, of the Houſe of Valois. The execution is not inferior to the judiciouſneſs of the deſign. His book has an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer in every perſon of ſentiment and taſte.</p>
                     <p>The late Mr. Sheridan is allowed to have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed conſiderable abilities. He has given the world a ſpecimen of them in his life of Swift. It is, however, in my idea, too flattering a portrait. The painter was a countryman, and an admirer. No talents can convert deformity into beauty, or make darkneſs to be light.</p>
                     <p>Swift was a very great, original genius; but the indecency of ſome of his writings is intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; his ſpleen, exceſſive, and his behaviour to Stella an <hi>eternal</hi> ſtigma on his memory and his virtues. Ever dabbling in the turbid ocean of politics, what buſineſs had he with the quiet and retired haven of the church? But genius and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents can embelliſh any ſide of a ſubject, and the biographer has poured, on his favourite author, a deluge of panegyric.</p>
                     <p>The life of Garrick is ſo much interſperſed with the <hi>domeſtic</hi> hiſtory, and the moſt illuſtrious perſons of his time, that it will highly engage and gratify your curioſity. It is written by Davies in two volumes.</p>
                     <p>England has long laboured with a diſorder, that I cannot call by a better name, than the <hi>theatrical
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:023176_0121_0FBDE13C796081D0"/>mania.</hi> A principal actor is more diſtinguiſhed, careſſed and enriched by a luxurious nation, than many of the moſt deſerving perſons, in the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profeſſions. An Abingdon, a Siddons, and a Mara (as once a Garrick, a Henderſon, and a Yates,) inchant the feelings of a Britiſh audience, drain the money which ſhould be ſacred to better purpoſes, acquire, in a few years, an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fortune and are admitted to the firſt circles in the kingdom, whilſt a thouſand, amiable and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious clergymen are ſuffered to live in want, and to die in the moſt uncomfortable obſcurity. This is not a very favourable trait in the <hi>moral</hi> hiſtory of a nation. It ſeems rather a ſymptom of its approaching diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>Hume was a great champion of infidelity, and as ſuch, a character, that excites uncommon curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. He has written his own life, and, as an unique in biography, it is worthy your reading.</p>
                     <p>Bolingbroke was another of the <hi>ſceptical</hi> family. His hiſtory is agreeably recorded by Dr. Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith.</p>
                     <p>On the ſubject of biography, you will meet with a great variety of other, entertaining writers; but I muſt not cloſe this article, without particularly recommending a book, that has given me ſo much pleaſure and information, as the life and writings of Gray, by Mr. Maſon.</p>
                     <p>A particular friendſhip of the warmeſt and moſt diſintereſted kind, ſubſiſted betwixt theſe celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed authors. It commenced in that early period of life, when ſouls are incapable of guile or ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mutally <hi>expand;</hi> and Maſon has endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to immortalize it in a manner, which does equal credit to his heart and underſtanding.</p>

The hiſtory of a retired, literary perſon cannot, generally, preſent much variety of entertainment.

A celebrated writer<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Cheſterfield.</note> has called geography and chronology, the two <hi>eyes</hi> of hiſtory; the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms you <hi>where</hi> events happened, and the latter, at what particular <hi>period;</hi> if it was not for theſe helps your reading would be a confuſed chaos, without order, light or perſpicuity.</p>
                     <p>Geography is, indeed, ſo much attended to at all ſchools, that there is little occaſion to dwell on its neceſſity; if you have learned the uſe of the globes, and the diviſion of it by names, which are only <hi>fancied</hi> for the ſake of reducing the immenſity of it to the narrow ſcale of human comprehenſion, the beſt method, I know, is never to read the name of a place in a common news paper, or any other hiſtory, without immediately recurring to authorities for the ſituation and diviſion of the country in which it lies, the manners of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, their ceremonies, civil government, and religious inſtitutions. It is this mode of ſtudying from the <hi>urgency</hi> of the occaſion, which gives energy to our reſearches and vigour to improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Guthrie is one of the beſt authors in geography; and for chronology, the tables of Dr. Prieſtley (a name, which I would only mention, where ſcience and not <hi>religion,</hi> is concerned,) are ſo compendious and comprehenſive, as to afford you, on a ſingle glance, conſiderable information. There is no ſpecies of knowledge, that is ſo eaſily attained, as that of geography: nor any of which the want is more flagrant and awkward.</p>
                     <p>I lately bluſhed for a young lady, who was aſked in company, the latitude and ſituation of a
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:023176_0124_0FBDE140ED193E08"/>particular place, which happened to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the public papers of the day. She was dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the higheſt taſte. The roſes and carnations vied in her countenance. She piques herſelf on her ſmartneſs and vivacity; but in this inſtance, could make no reply. Her <hi>embarraſſment</hi> betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ignorance, and <hi>politeneſs</hi> relieved it by a change of converſation.</p>
                     <p>How much higher would her character have ſtood in the eſtimation of all ſentible and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, if ſhe had come down ſtairs, dreſſed in an elegant plainneſs, and, inſtead of ſtanding ſo long before her glaſs, had devoted ſome little ſhare of her time to this ſpecies of improvement. Not that I have any objection to a bluſh upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's cheek. I think the crimſon tint ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but I would have <hi>yours</hi> to be the bluſh of <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> and <hi>reſerve,</hi> not of <hi>ignorance, ſhyneſs</hi> or <hi>ill-breeding.</hi>

                        <salute>MY DEAR LUCY,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>NATURAL hiſtory is another ſtudy, which I conceive to be particularly <hi>feminine.</hi> It has, of late, been cultivated with uncommon attention. Botany has been, particularly, faſhionable. It has found a place in the amuſements of the elegant,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:023176_0125_0FBDE14267249588"/>as well as the learned. Nothing is more calculated to amuſe the mind, improve the health and ſpirits, and to inſpire at once cheerfulneſs and devotion.</p>
                     <p>The ſuprizing hiſtory of plants and flowers, the immenſe variety, the mechaniſm, order, government and economy of animals, fowls with their plumage and fiſhes with their ſcales, foſſils, minerals, petrefactions, mountains, vallies, vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos, all nature full of life, full of happineſs and full of miracles, will crowd your mind with the ſublimeſt images, and teach you to adore the great, almighty former and preſerver of the world. What beauty in each flower! What traits of divine wiſdom and goodneſs in an inſect! Surveyed with a truly philoſophical eye, the whole creation is a temple! Not a ſhrub, but is eloquent, not an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcule, but is a powerful monitor of virtue!</p>
                     <p>I never ſpend an afternoon with Miſs Louiſa —without being both inſtructed and delighted. I never take a walk with her in the garden, but ſhe unfolds a thouſand, natural curioſities, which had hitherto eſcaped my unſcienced or inattentive eyes. I never ramble with her into the fields, but ſhe gives me ſuch an hiſtory of the moſt common plants and flowers, as at once ſurprizes my curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and gratifies my taſte. In her cloſet ſhe has a large collection of inſects, which her microſcope clothes with moſt exquiſite beauty, and a muſeum, filedd with ſhells, corals, and petrefactions, the ſparkling of which is exceeded by nothing, but the vivacity of her eyes, or the ſtronger or more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent luſtre of her virtues.</p>
                     <p>I would infinitely rather have her taſte, than her fortune. And I never quit her without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly envying her enjoyments. She is ever
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:023176_0126_0FBDE143E7852C18"/>ſprightly, becauſe ſhe has never a moment <hi>unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</hi> She always <hi>ſmiles,</hi> becauſe ſhe is always innocent. Her pleaſures are of the rational and <hi>refined</hi> kind. They never leave a thorn in the heart, or pluck one, bluſhing roſe from her cheeks. How ſolid and how calm, if compared with the midnight revels of faſhion, or the giddineſs of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration!</p>
                     <p>Be like Louiſa, my dear girl, and you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be happy. Study nature, till it leads you up to nature's God. Pore on plants and flowers, till they perfume you with a <hi>real</hi> devotion; and I will engage you to become, in your turn, one of the moſt beautiful flowers in the creation.</p>

                     <p>NATURAL hiſtory is divided into three grand parts, as it reſpects the animal, the mineral, and the vegetable kingdoms, and under theſe different ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, aſſumes the name of zoology, or an hiſtory of animals; lithology, or a deſcription of ſtones, foſſils, &amp;c. and botany, or an account of herbs, plants, flowers. Theſe again have, each their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective ſubdiviſions.</p>
                     <p>Linnaeus, who was born at Upſal, is the great father of this ſcience, and from the Swediſh ſchool have iſſued the works of the moſt eminent maſters. But he is too voluminous and ſcientific for a female, who wants only a <hi>general</hi> knowledge
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:023176_0127_0FBDE1456422B3B0"/>of nature, and not to penetrate the minutiae of her plan.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Amaenitates Academicae</hi> are a number of ingenious eſſays on a variety of ſubjects, ſelected from the works of the moſt capital diſciples of the Linnaean ſchool. Some of thoſe have been tranſlated by Stillingfleet, under the name of Tracts on Natural Hiſtory, and are very valuable and inſtructive; 'others by Brand, in two volumes, which contain a number of very curious and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining deſcriptions.</p>
                     <p>Pulteny's View of the Works of Linnaeus you may read, likewiſe, with great pleaſure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. Next to theſe I ſhould recommend to a mere Engliſh reader, the works of Ray: him, who wrote "The wiſdom of God in the creation." They are highly uſeful and valuable, though writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before this ſtudy had arrived to its preſent ſtate of perfection.</p>
                     <p>Goldſmith's Hiſtory of the Earth and animated Nature is but a mere compilation. Still it may have its uſe, as affording ſome <hi>collateral</hi> lights and inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Buffon is an author of firſt rate abilities. His ſtyle is ſplendid; his knowledge is extenſive, and his eloquence, in a high degree, brilliant and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing. But I cannot recommend him for many reaſons. He is too <hi>voluminous;</hi> the extenſiveneſs of his plan leads him into a great variety of detail, and of <hi>inddicate</hi> deſcriptions. He is more attached to ſyſtems of his own, than the diſcovery of trath; and he is a ſort of <hi>ſceptic,</hi> who reſolves every thing into a chain of <hi>ſecondary</hi> cauſes, and <hi>ſacrilegiouſly</hi> excludes the Deity from his creation. This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is the <hi>bane</hi> of <hi>modern</hi> philoſophers. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:023176_0128_0FBDE146E6C4A308"/>to account for <hi>every</hi> thing upon <hi>natural</hi> principles, and wherever they are puzzled, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly diſbelieve. Inſtead of making their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a ſcaffolding to God, they build on it, a monument to their own vanity and folly, which will not ſtand, "when winds and ſtorms ariſe." Do people of ſuch diſtinguiſhed abilities need to be reminded, that a world without deſign, or an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive machine, without a <hi>firſt,</hi> moving principle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves the greateſt and moſt palpable of contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Nature, in the hands of a <hi>true</hi> philoſopher, reads a continual leſſon of piety; in thoſe of a <hi>falſe</hi> one, it is the parent of ſcepticiſm, gloom and deſpair. Sir Iſaac Newton was the moſt pious of men; many of his <hi>humble</hi> followers have been as impious <hi>retailers</hi> of infidelity.</p>
                     <p>You will derive great pleaſure and improvement from all the writings of Mr. Pennant, and they are numerous. Always lively and always authentic, they entertain the man of taſte, the ſcholar, and the antiquarian, as well as the naturaliſt. Few perſons have publiſhed ſo much, in any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of ſcience, with ſo great ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The Flora Londinenſis of Curtis is a ſplendid work, that does credit to the author. It is embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with beautiful engravings of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon plants and flowers of this country, and is ſtill in continuation.</p>
                     <p>Volcanoes are amongſt the <hi>prodigies</hi> of nature, which fill the mind with the grandeſt and ſublimeſt images. Hamilton's account of them, and Raſpe on the volcanos in Germany, will aſtoniſh your imagination. You may add to the liſt Swammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's Hiſtory of Inſects, tranſlated by Floyd, and reviſed by Dr. Hill.</p>

But I will deſiſt, for if I was to give you only the <hi>names</hi> of writers on the ſubject, they would fill a volume. No private fortune would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to purchaſe them, and the peruſal would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more time, than would conſiſt with your other, various engagements.</p>

                     <p>POETRY, I do not with you to cultivate, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to poſſeſs a <hi>reliſh</hi> for its beauties. Verſes, if not excellent, are execrable indeed. The muſes live upon a <hi>mount,</hi> and there is no enjoying any of their favours, unleſs you can climb to the heights of Parnaſſus.</p>
                     <p>Beſides a paſſion for poetry is dangerous to a woman. It heightens her natural ſenſibility to an extravagant degree, and frequently inſpires ſuch a romantic turn of mind, as is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with all the ſolid duties and proprieties of life.</p>
                     <p>To increaſe the number of <hi>imaginary,</hi> when life abounds with ſuch <hi>real</hi> ſorrows, by nurſing a ſickly extravagant ſenſibility, is, in a rational creature, the very height of imprudence. The ancients endeavoured to cheriſh fortitude, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, by giving ſtrength to the body and vigour to the mind. From ſome of their ſtates.
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:023176_0131_0FBDE14B65F358E8"/>poetry, amongſt other things, was abſolutely <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,</hi> as tending to <hi>enervate</hi> the minds of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and unfit them for the ſtruggles and activities of life; and it is certain that the owners of an exquiſite ſenſibility, for a few <hi>moments</hi> of pleaſure, have <hi>days</hi> of vexation. In this human wilderneſs, <hi>thorns</hi> are perennials. <hi>Roſes</hi> are but the <hi>periſhable</hi> ornaments of ſummer.</p>
                     <p>The late Mr. shenſtone, amongſt many others, is an unhappy inſtance of the misfortune, I have mentioned. His works, though not of the <hi>firſt</hi> magnitude, are exceedingly agreeable; but his poetical enthuſiaſm was a ſource of <hi>perpetual</hi> irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and misfortune. Having cultivated his taſte, more than his prudence, his feelings, more than his fortitude, and his imagination, more than his judgment, his life was one, unvaried train of inquietudes. His mind was ruffled with <hi>imaginary</hi> injuries; his peace diſturbed with <hi>fanciful</hi> affronts, and his diſordered finances left him every thing, but comfort, dignity, and independence.</p>
                     <p>With a fortune, that only juſtified a neat and <hi>homely</hi> dwelling, his genius was not content with leſs than the ſuperb appendages of a palace. In forming the <hi>Leaſeowes,</hi> he ſacrificed to enthuſiaſm, what he owed to contentment. He panted for a <hi>paradiſe,</hi> and a paradiſe he had; but it ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a wilderneſs of thorns. Mercileſs creditors had no candour for the poet, and made no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the exquiſiteneſs of his taſte.</p>
                     <p>They ſaw no charms in ſhrubs, in bloſſoms, or in proſpects, and they awoke him with an iron graſp, from his delicious intrancement.

                     <p>THOUGH I do not with you to become a poet, it is, however, neceſſary, that you ſhould not be wholly unacquainted with the writings of many, inimitable bards. They will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine your taſte, and ſpread a very elegant repaſt for your private amuſement.</p>
                     <p>Shakeſpeare is, perhaps, the firſt genius of the world; and ſome of his dramatic works, whilſt they aſtoniſh, will give you an uſeful fund of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical information.</p>
                     <p>The immortal poem of Paradiſe Loſt ſhould not only be in the <hi>hands,</hi> but graven on the <hi>heart,</hi> of every woman, becauſe Milton, above all other authors, deſcribes the diſtinguiſhing graces of the ſex, and in his Eve, has exhibited an exquiſite pattern of female perfection. On <hi>this</hi> ſubject, his feelings were always awakened in an extraordinary manner; his imagination glowed, and he has given it the fineſt touches of his pencil.</p>
                     <p>Milton like all great men, was fully ſenſible of the bleſſings we derive from the ſociety of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and how <hi>cheerleſs</hi> the face of nature would have been without them. He, therefore, <hi>labours</hi>
                        <pb n="124" facs="unknown:023176_0133_0FBDE14E9B0A16B0"/>to make the mother of his Paradiſe every thing, that could charm, and every thing that could alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the infelicities of life. Let the libertine read his deſcription of marriage, and tell me what he thinks of the prevailing rage for impurity and ſeduction.</p>
                     <p>Homer is univerſally celebrated; and, though you cannot read his poem in the original language, Pope has given an admirable tranſlation. The ſame may be ſaid of Dryden's Virgil, if you wiſh to taſte the exquiſite richneſs of theſe ancient authors.</p>
                     <p>Maſon's poems have great merit, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him a conſiderable celebrity. His Carac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus, his Elfrida, and his Engliſh Garden have all been admired. Nothing, however, from his pen, has pleaſed me more, than the epitaph upon his lady. His talents ſeem to be particularly formed for the penſive and pathetic. But poetry, after all, is but an <hi>embelliſhment,</hi> and, in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>divine,</hi> a very ſecondary diſtinction. How much more important and uſeful to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are the labours of that paſtor, who, by one judicious, impaſſioned and well directed diſcourſe, appals the ſinner, encourages the faint, revives the drooping, guides the perplexed, or conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to cheer the bed of ſickneſs with divine conſolations!</p>
                     <p>This remark, however, is not particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to depreciate the ingenious author of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractacus. He is ſaid to excel likewiſe, as a preacher.</p>

                     <p>IN poetry, the <hi>ladies</hi> have, of late, aſſerted their claim to genius, and the trampled honours of their underſtanding. Several of them appear, in the walks of Parnaſſus, with conſiderable luſtre.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Seward, in my idea, is a ſtar of the firſt magnitude in the hemiſphere of imagination. She has given us chiefly little, fugitive pieces; a monody on the death of captain Cook, and major Andre; a poem to the memory of lady Miller, and a few ſtanzas to Mr. Wright, on taking her father's picture. The laſt always gave me the higheſt pleaſure. It required indeed no great effort, but is a moſt pleaſing ſpecimen of filial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and of a rich, fervid, glowing imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Her Louiſa, though her largeſt, is not, in my idea, her <hi>happieſt</hi> performance. A novel is too much dignified by the charms of poetry. It is a courteſan, dreſſed like a queen.</p>
                     <p>Whenever Miſs Hannah More takes up her pen, ſhe never loſes ſight of piety and virtue. Her Bleeding rock, Search after Happineſs, Sir Eldred of the Bower, Sacred Dramas, Female Fables, &amp;c. will pleaſe and inſtruct you. The little tract, lately publiſhed, intitled, "Thoughts on the Manners of the Great," which has had ſo very extenſive a circulation, is ſaid to have come from her ingenious pen. The deſign is excellent, and the execution diſplays a conſiderable knowledge of human life and manners. I wiſh it may leave ſome laſting impreſſions. But alas! the diſſipated have few intervals for reflection.</p>

                        <pb n="126" facs="unknown:023176_0135_0FBDE1516991C110"/>
Miſs Williams bids fair for a poetic laurel, that ſhall long be green. Her Peru, is awork of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable merit.</p>
                     <p>The little ſonnets of Miſs Charlotte Smith are ſoft, penſive, ſentimental and pathetic, as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's productions ſhould be. The muſes, if I miſt ake not, will, in time, raiſe her to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eminence. She has, <hi>as yet,</hi> ſtepped forth only in little things, with a diffidence that is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of real genius in its <hi>firſt</hi> attempts. Her next, public entre may be more in ſtyle, and more conſequential.</p>
                     <p>The Comteſſe le Genlis I have before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a woman of a fine taſte, and a cultivated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Her <hi>Theatre ſur l'Education,</hi> as found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a <hi>dramatic</hi> plan, may be recommended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other poetical productions. There is not a ſweeter roſe in the garden of <hi>nature,</hi> than hers of Salency.</p>
                     <p>Lord Lyttleton was not, by any means, a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal poet. There is, however, ſuch a delicacy, ſoftneſs, piety, and tender pathos in his ſtrains, as do the higheſt credit to his <hi>own</hi> heart, and muſt improve that of every attentive reader. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nody upon his Lucy has immortalized his ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, his affection, and his virtue.</p>
                     <p>Akenſide's work on the Pleaſures of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, needs no other recommendation, than what it has received from a generous and a diſcerning public. It is highly intereſting; it required a very conſiderable effort, and his genius has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it beautifully pictureſque.</p>
                     <p>Cowper's poems are calculated to do conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice. He has made the muſes hand-maids to religion. He has choſen verſes, only as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023176_0136_0FBDE152E53498E0"/>for conveving inſtructions of ſo important a nature, as would not, by any means, have diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the pulpit. His ſtyle is ſimple, bold, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpirited and energetic, his judgment, ſtrong and penetrating; his metaphors, forcible and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily conceived; his obſervations on life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, accurate, and his ſatire, juſt and poignant.</p>
                     <p>He does not ſeem ſo much to have ſtudied the production of a poem, with unity for its deſign, and harmony in all its parts, as to ſerve the cauſe of piety and virtue by general, deſultory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned reflexions. His work on the whole, is a ſtrong ſpecimen of genius and talents; rigid criticiſm, perhaps, would ſay, that his piety wants a little mildneſs, and ſeems to breathe the ſpirit of a party.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt finiſhed poet of the age is Hayley. His Eſſay on Hiſtory and on Epic Poetry, his Ode to Howard, and his Triumphs of Temper have received very great and very general applauſe.</p>

                     <p>YOUR queſtion is a very proper one, and I will give you the beſt ſatisfaction in my power.</p>
                     <p>Pronunciation or that part of grammar, called <hi>Orthoepy,</hi> as to any uncommon or difficult words, is governed by the quantity, which thoſe words have in the <hi>original</hi> language, from which they are derived. As you cannot be ſuppoſed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:023176_0137_0FBDE15464239258"/>the dead languages, you will of courſe, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, be at a loſs how to pronounce many words with propriety. The only method is recourſe to a dictionary, and the beſt in my opinion, are thoſe of Sheridan and Johnſon. Pronunciation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is a very fluctuating thing; and though there certainly is a ſtandard of propriety, over which mere faſhion <hi>ought</hi> to have no power, yet I ſhould always recommend a conformity to the manners of the politeſt people you may happen to converſe with, rather than a pedantic affectation of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſtrictneſs. The latter would be thought a <hi>conceited</hi> oſtentation of knowledge, which, in a young lady, would not be forgiven.</p>
                     <p>The alluſions to Jupiter, Pallas, Venus, the Graces, the Muſes, Helicon, Parnaſſus, which have ſo much puzzled you in the poets you have lately read, will be fully explained in Tooke's Pantheon, or Hiſtory of the Heathen Gods. The <hi>general</hi> fact is, that before the knowledge of the true God dawned on their minds, theſe poor, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant heathens never dreamed of <hi>one</hi> omnipotent, all ſufficient, all pervading ſpirit, which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have revealed, and deſcribed, as poſſeſſed of all poſſible perfections. They, therefore, formed to themſelves a <hi>multiplicity</hi> of gods, and attributed to one of them in particular, with a <hi>ſpecific</hi> name, every great quality or ſuperior excellence, that appeared beyond the ability of <hi>mortals.</hi> Theſe deities they arranged into different claſſes, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſuppoſed degrees of pre-eminence; and fancied ſome of them to inhabit the heavens, and others, the woods, groves, rivers, ſprings, mountains, &amp;c.</p>

You will be amuſed with their fanciful opinions; and if you think aright, you will learn to bleſs the Almighty, on your knees, for having caſt <hi>your</hi> lot in an age and country, where the goſpel has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed theſe miſts and errors, dignified our views and nature beyond all expreſſion, and given us the cleareſt knowledge of our duty. You will feel the force and propriety of that clauſe in our liturgy. <q>We bleſs thee for our creation, preſervation, and all the bleſſings of this life; but above all, for thine ineſtimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.</q>

                     <p>Writers on Sculpture and Architecture are not numerous, and I am wading beyond my depth, when I attempt to recommend them. Winkle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's reflexions on the ſculpture of the Greeks, Evelyn's Parallel of ancient and modern Architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Morris's Lectures may give you <hi>ſome</hi> ideas on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>On the art of <hi>painting,</hi> more has been written; yet without a natural genius for it, and ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious inſtructions from a <hi>maſter,</hi> I do not know, whether you will be able to make any great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</p>
                     <p>Webb's Inquiry into the Beauties of Painting is a very learned, elegant, ingenious work, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, in an high degree, even to thoſe, who are, by no means, to be ranked amongſt the <hi>cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcenti.</hi> The quotations from Homer, Virgil, Shakeſpeare, Milton, Boileau, Moliere, Racine, Taſſo, Arioſto and Metaſtaſio are not only well contrived to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> the ſubject, but to delight every perſon of reading and taſte; whilſt the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toreſque imagery and ſplendid language would ſtamp a value on any production.</p>
                     <p>I remember to have been charmed, ſome years ago, with reading a ſmall work, intided an <q>Eſſay on Prints and Pictureſque Beauty.</q> I do not recollect, whether it bore the name of any author; but it ſtruck me as a very intereſting and valuable performance.

                     <p>Ferguſon's Art of Drawing in Perſpective, I conceive to be uſeful, as an <hi>elementary</hi> work. An Eſſay on Landſcape may be conſidered in the ſame

                     <p>But the beſt place for gratifying your curioſity, and I ſhould think, for improving your taſte in paintings, is the annual exhibition of them, at Somerſet-houſe.

                        </gap>ing with the moſt celebrated maſters of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Under the hands of a Reynolds, a Wright, a Weſt, and many others, the Engliſh canvaſs glows with inimitable beauty.

                     <p>A ſtranger, indeed is, at firſt ſight, ſo much dazzled, with the ſplendour and elegance of the company about him, that, in the charms of <hi>living</hi> beauty, he is tempted to overlook the efforts of the pencil. In no other place, that I ever ſaw or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, do art and nature ſo powerfully combine to bewitch the ſenſes, and captivate the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>If my time and place of reſidence were at my own command, I ſhould frequently in the ſeaſon, devote to this pleaſure, one of thoſe languid, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon hours, when the ſpirits are exhauſted with

                     <p>I am much intereſted, believe me, in the reliſh I would give you for this ſpecies of improvement.— I look forward, with a degree of pleaſure, to the time, when I may be the companion of your little tours, and delighted with your obſervations;— when we may hang in curioſity, over foſſils and petrefactions; when we ſhall pore over paintings, buildings, ruins with all the luxury of artiſts and in ſuch rational, innocent pleaſures endeavour to forget the ſorrows, that will crowd on this <hi>varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi> life.</p>

                     <p>IT is ſo very agreeable to peruſe voyages and travels into <hi>foreign</hi> countries by way of coming ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily at a knowledge of their hiſtory, cuſtoms, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and degrees of civilization, that I do not wonder at the number and multiplicity of theſe productions. Authors wiſh to be <hi>read,</hi> and this is the ſort of work, which, if judiciouſly executed, ſuits every taſte. It has a tendency to enlarge the mind, and diveſt it of illiberal prejudices. Books of this kind are now become ſo numerous, that the difficulty only is how to make the ſelection.</p>
                     <p>I will begin with Moore, for he has pleaſed univerſally. Your collection will be graced by his View of Society and Manners in France,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023176_0142_0FBDE15BE55EC5C0"/>Switzerland, and Germany, in two volumes, and his View of Society in Italy, in two more.</p>
                     <p>Wraxall is another writer in this way, who has ſuperior merit. He has publiſhed a tour through the northern parts of Europe, and through France.</p>
                     <p>Pennant has been ſingularly happy in all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. He intereſts the antiquarian, the ſcholar and the man of genius in his various productions. His works are numerous. A Tour through Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Voyages to the Hebrides, a Tour in North Wales; a Journey to Snowdon; and a Journey from Cheſter to London, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Switzerland is one of thoſe, <hi>romantic</hi> countries, that delights us in idea. Coxe has given ſketches of it, in a very pleaſing and pictureſque manner.</p>
                     <p>Sherlock's Engliſh Traveller is a very original and entertaining book. The author is evidently a man of fanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and genius, but rather fulſome in his panegyries on particular characters, and excentric both in his ſentiments and manner. He will, ſometimes, make you ſmile with egotiſms and the appearance of conceit; but he will likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten your underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Cordiner's Antiquities and Scenery of the North of Scotland is an entertaining work. The plates annexed to it, pleaſe the eye, and invigorate the imagination.</p>
                     <p>A tour to the lakes is become very faſhionable, and is ſaid abundantly to repay the travellers cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. Weſt's deſcription of them may be uſeful, though the language appears too florid and poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                     <p>The Tour to Ermenonville I have never ſeen; but it is mentioned as poſſeſſing conſiderable merit. Gilpin's Deſcription of the River Wye abounds
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:023176_0143_0FBDE15D66004198"/>with beautiful ſcenery, and is a moſt lively and entertaining production.</p>
                     <p>But the catalogue would be endleſs. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, other books of this kind, are at hand, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are diſpoſed to travel with them in your cloſet.</p>
                     <p>If you have a little knowledge of Heraldry, it will be an <hi>embelliſhment;</hi> an agreeable exerciſe of your taſte and ingenuity, and may, occaſionally, ſuggeſt a channel, through which you may ſerve a valuable friend. The only books I recollect, are the Elements of it, by Porney; Gwillim, a large folio, and Edmondſon's Complete Body of it; in two volumes.</p>
                     <p>But after all this recommendation of different ſtudies, do not miſtake me. I do not want to make you a fine writer, an hiſtorian, a naturaliſt, a geographer, an aſtronomer, a poet, a painter, a connoiſſeur, or a virtuoſo of any kind.

The paſſions of mankind, however, have very much debaſed and <hi>profaned</hi> this art, which, like others was <hi>originally</hi> ſacred, and intended to chant the praiſes of the Almighty.

Modern manners, however, have carried the fondneſs for this accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment to an <hi>immoderate</hi> extreme. A paſſion for making the beſt figure in a minuet, is vaſtly beneath the dignity of a woman's underſtanding. And I am not ſure, whether <hi>excelling</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular does not inſpire too great a fondneſs for diſſipating pleaſures, and proportionably abate the ardour for more retired virtues. A woman, who can ſparkle and engage the admiration of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery beholder, at a birth night or a ball, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways content with the graver office of managing a family, or the ſtill and ſober innocence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſcenes. Beſides dancing is not, at <hi>certain</hi> moments, without its temptations. An elegant, illuminated room, brilliant company, the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers of muſic, admiring eyes, obſequious
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:023176_0147_0FBDE16366277C90"/>beaus, attitude, &amp;c. are apt to tranſport the mind a little beyond the rational medium of <hi>gentle</hi> agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>I would not, however, be a <hi>cynical</hi> moraliſt, that would abridge you of any harmleſs amuſement. I have only my apprehenſions for your innocence, for indeed it is a plant of a very delicate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. And you will <hi>then</hi> have attained the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of your character, when you can mix a paſſion for theſe elegant accompliſhments, with a turn for ſolid and domeſtic virtue; when you can, one night be diſtinguiſhed at a ball, and the next want no other entertainment, than what the ſhade, your family, a well choſen book or an agreeable walk are able to afford.

                     <p>Some ladies, who were remarkably attentive to their perſons <hi>before</hi> marriage, neglect them <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> in an egregious manner. They cannot pay a worſe compliment to their own delicacy, or to their huſbands. If they conceived ſome efforts neceſſary to <hi>gain</hi> the prize, more, I am ſure, are required to preſerve it.</p>
                     <p>It is the opinion of (I believe,) Rochefoucault, that nice obſerver of life and manners, that the affection of woman <hi>increaſes</hi> after marriage, whilſt that of man is apt to <hi>decline.</hi> Whatever be the <hi>cauſe,</hi> a prudent woman will, at leaſt, uſe every method in her power, to guard againſt ſo <hi>mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> a charge. Neatneſs, however, is <hi>eaſily</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and will always have conſiderable weight.</p>
                     <p>In the eyes of <hi>ſervants</hi> and domeſtics, indeed, a woman loſes her conſequence and authority by a neglect of her perſon. She will not be obeyed with <hi>cheerfulneſs,</hi> and ſhe will become an object of <hi>ridicule,</hi> in all their private parties and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If inferiors muſt be ſubject, they will pay an <hi>unconſtrained</hi> homage only to a perſon, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts by <hi>propriety,</hi> the eſtimation of the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="unknown:023176_0149_0FBDE166662B2610"/>
Neatneſs is the <hi>natural</hi> garb of a well ordered mind, and has a near alliance with <hi>purity</hi> of heart. Law has ſaid of his Miranda, that ſhe was always clean <hi>without,</hi> becauſe ſhe was always pure <hi>within.</hi> And Richardſon, whoſe taſte was as exquiſite, as his imagination glowing, has painted his Clariſſa, as always dreſſed, before ſhe came down ſtairs, for any company, that might break in upon her during the whole day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Finery</hi> is ſeldom graceful. The eaſy undreſs of a morning often pleaſes more, than the moſt ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate and coſtly ornaments. I need not ſay of how much time and money they rob us, which are ſacred to virtue and to the poor, nor how ſoon this very <hi>embelliſhed</hi> body will be duſt and aſhes. The perfection of the art is conveyed in <hi>two</hi> words; an <hi>elegant ſimplicity.</hi> Ladies are certainly injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in employing ſo many <hi>male</hi> friſeurs about their perſons. The cuſtom is indelicate; it is contrary to <hi>cleanineſs,</hi> and all their manoeuvres cannot equal the beauty of natural, eaſy ringlets, untortured and unadorned.</p>
                     <p>The nearer you approach to the <hi>maſculine</hi> in your apparel, the further you will recede from the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate</hi> graces and <hi>ſoftneſs</hi> of your ſex. Addiſon, in his day, laſhed, with a delicate vein of <hi>irony,</hi> this abſurd <hi>transformation.</hi> The preſent age wants ſuch an inimitabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> cenſor. The riding habits, particularly, that have been ſo faſhionable, and even made their appearance at all public places, conceal every thing that is attractive in a woman's perſon, her figure, her manner, and her graces. They wholly <hi>unſex</hi> her, and give her the unpleaſing air of an Amazon, or a virago. Who likes the idea? or if you would be more ſtruck with the <hi>abſurdity,</hi> tell
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:023176_0150_0FBDE167E5CA4160"/>me what you would think of <hi>petite maitres</hi> in muffs? You immediately deſpiſe the ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the one; we daily <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>unnaturalneſs</hi> of the other. We forget that you are <hi>women</hi> in <hi>ſuch a garb,</hi> and we forget to love.</p>
                     <p>Every public paper one opens, is a violation of your delicacy and an inſult to your underſtanding. Powders, perfumes, pomatums, coſmetics, eſſence of roſes, Olimpian dew, artificial eyes, teeth, hair advertiſed for your advantage, would be an heavy ſtigma, if ſome kind and <hi>well diſpoſed</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons amongſt <hi>our own ſex,</hi> were not willing to ſhare with you a part of the burden. Bluſh, my dear girl, at ſuch unſeemly practices. Be content to be what God, and nature <hi>intended</hi> you: appear in your true colours; abhor any thing, like <hi>deceit</hi> in your <hi>appearance,</hi> as well as your character.— What muſt all ſenſible men think of a woman, who has a room, filled with a thouſand preparations and mixtures to <hi>deceive</hi> him? What money, what time muſt be given to this <hi>odious,</hi> inſufferable vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! Under ſuch <hi>unnatural</hi> management; how different muſt be the female of the <hi>evening</hi> and the <hi>morning!</hi> What muſt we think of marriage; dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rooms and toilets! What an opening for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation, coldneſſes, averſions! If an <q>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſimplicity</q> be the <hi>perfection</hi> of dreſs, this is ſurely, as far as poſſible, removed from perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not <hi>ſimplicity;</hi> it is not <hi>elegant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would be cruel to add any thing to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>men,</hi> who can have recourſe to ſuch <hi>effeminate</hi> artifices. They have <hi>already</hi> the ſcorn and ridicule of one ſex, and the ſtern contempt and indignation of the other. They are poor, amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023176_0151_0FBDE169638746A0"/>animals, that the beſt naturaliſts know not, under what claſs to arrange.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Painting</hi> is indecent, offenſive, <hi>criminal.</hi> It haſtens the approach of wrinkles; it deſtroys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and defaces the image of your maker.</p>
                     <p>Would you think of giving the laſt touch to the pieces of a Pouffin, or a Salvator Roſa? Believe for a moment, that the Almighty is, at leaſt, as great in <hi>his</hi> way, as either of theſe artiſts.</p>
                     <p>Let the martyrs of faſhion, luxury and diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who turn night into day, have recourſe to this filthy and abominable practice. Let them ſeek a reſource from the rebukes of their conſcience in gaiety and noiſe. But let the fairneſs of <hi>your</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion be only that of <hi>nature,</hi> and let <hi>your rouge</hi> be the crimſon bluſh of health, ariſing from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, regularity, exerciſe and air.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>Such <hi>ſimplicity</hi> will recommend you to God;— and, if you retain any fears of offending him, how dare you deface his image, in your countenance, by <hi>artificial</hi> decorations.

                     <p>A WOMAN may be fairly allowed a little more attention to <hi>ornament,</hi> than would be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the other ſex. Nature, through all her works has laviſhed more <hi>external</hi> brilliancy, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring and plumage on the <hi>female.</hi> And though dreſs, in itſelf, is no <hi>eſſential</hi> quality, we are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to judge more of your <hi>real</hi> character and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from it, than you are apt to imagine. We fancy it, in its different <hi>modifications,</hi> a mark of good ſenſe, delicacy and diſcretion, or of the very oppoſite defects. Every ſenſible wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, therefore, will ſtudy it ſo far, as not to ſubject herſelf to unfavorable conſtructions. She will endeavour to convince every beholder, that ſhe knows the proper <hi>medium</hi> betwixt a ridiculous
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023176_0155_0FBDDF4BE7FB4678"/>
                        <hi>profuſion,</hi> and a total <hi>want,</hi> of ornament; that ſhe can tiſſue plainneſs with elegance; that ſhe does not wiſh to <hi>ſeduce</hi> by her appearance, but only to <hi>pleaſe;</hi> that ſhe has cultivated her mind, much more than her perſon, and placed the higheſt value, not on the <hi>outward,</hi> periſhable <hi>caſket,</hi> but the diamond <hi>within.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I rejoice that the good ſenſe of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women has corrected ſome late <hi>glaring</hi> indecencies of dreſs. Young ladies ſhould not be <hi>too liberal</hi> in the <hi>diſplay</hi> of their charms, Too much <hi>expoſure</hi> does not enhance their value. And it approaches, too nearly, to the manner of <hi>thoſe</hi> women, whom they would ſurely think it no honour to reſemble. Boſoms ſhould throb <hi>unſeen.</hi> The bouffant was an ornament of too <hi>tranſparent</hi> a kind. Wherever delicacy throws its modeſt drapery, <hi>imagination</hi> always lends inexpreſſible charms. As fine a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as the Venus of Medici, would ceaſe to be admired, if curioſity ceaſed to be <hi>ſuſpended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a great <hi>neatneſs</hi> in the dreſs of quakers, and of ſome other ſectaries, who have copied their example. It has, however, more <hi>primneſs,</hi> than eaſe. In this reſpect, you have too much good ſenſe to affect <hi>ſingularity.</hi> Religion conſiſts in ſomething more <hi>ſubſtantial,</hi> than any <hi>particular</hi> modes of appearance. And there is, if I miſtake not, ſome <hi>conceit</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> under this prodigious, <hi>ever-acted</hi> plainneſs. Many, whom theſe narrow minded perſons would ſentence, perhaps to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for being elegantly dreſſed, have hearts that overflow with univerſal benevolence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more piety and goodneſs, than themſelves.</p>
                     <p>You know what young lady I mean by <hi>Emelia.</hi> I do not know a perſon, that dreſſes better. She
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023176_0156_0FBDDF4D66569EF8"/>is ſingularly happy in her choice of <hi>colours.</hi> Like her virtues they are of the ſoft and <hi>ſhaded</hi> kind, not the brilliant or the gaudy. I never ſaw her ſine; but ſhe never is <hi>fantaſtic.</hi> She is ſeldom ſplendid; but <hi>neatneſs</hi> is all her own. If ſhe puts on only a ribbon, it is ſelected with all the exquiſite modeſty of her mind, and diſpoſed of by the hands of taſte. The graces always appear to have been in waiting for the few moments, that ſhe ever ſuffers dreſs to take up her attention.</p>
                     <p>I very much admire the ſaſhes, which, of late, have been ſo faſhionable amongſt young ladies.— They give me the idea of a childiſh ſimplicity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and eaſe. Theſe, and <hi>

Innocent relaxation is as much a part of true wiſdom, as employment itſelf. Indeed it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to fit us for our duties.

                     <p>The rule is, we ſhould amuſe ourſelves, in order to <hi>live,</hi> in the true ſenſe of the word, and not live to be <hi>amuſed.</hi> Relaxation, conducted on <hi>this</hi> principle, will never occupy too great a ſhare of our time or attention.

The exerciſe of parental or filial affection is a ſource of <hi>heart-felt</hi> and refined pleaſure. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of tenderneſs betwixt branches of the ſame family, and the little engaging attentions they create, ſtimulate the finer movements of the body, and give play to all the refreſhing emotions.

                     <p>Exerciſe in the open air, is another great amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Freſh breezes, variety of objects, gentle motion, and all the charming pictures of nature cheer the mind, and invigorate the ſpirits. The ſedentary life of women is the parent of many faſhionable complaints; weak nerves, low ſpirits, vapours, hyſterics, languors. <hi>No</hi> conſtitution can

                     <p>The ancients paid a very nice attention to the conſtitution of females.

                     <p>Attention to a <hi>garden</hi> is truly <hi>feminine</hi> amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If you mix it with a taſte for botany and a knowledge of plants and flowers, you will never be in want of an excellent reſtorative. Our firſt parents are deſcribed by Milton, as tending the ſhrubs and flowers of their paradiſe, with unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiduity, and as riſing with the dawn to work:</p>

Our Saviour often reſorted to a garden. Innocence and piety found it the happieſt place for meditation and repoſe. It is impoſſible, indeed, to have a richer bleſſing,

It has been objected to your ſex, that they are prone to <hi>ſatire.</hi> At a certain <hi>age,</hi> and under ſome <hi>diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> perhaps this is true. They have been col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, for many years, a quantity of ſpleen, and imprudently diſcharge it on every perſon, that falls in their way. This renders a woman <hi>unlovely</hi> indeed. Nay the attempt at <hi>wit,</hi> or ſaying <hi>ſmart</hi> things, is, by no means to be encouraged. <hi>True</hi> humour is the lot of few, and can <hi>never</hi> be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to a <hi>woman.</hi> From <hi>her</hi> we expect the qualities, that pleaſe, ſooth and enliven. Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately they, who think themſelves in poſſeſſion of this weapon, are brandiſhing it <hi>indiſcriminately</hi> on all occaſions, ſo as ſometimes to wound their very <hi>neareſt</hi> friends. If you could really ſay the <hi>ſmarteſt</hi> things, you might be <hi>feared,</hi> but you never would be <hi>loved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>curioſity</hi> of women is a <hi>proverbial</hi> object of ſatire, and gives birth to all that little goſſiping, which I have reprobated. Never convince the world, by an attention to mere trifles, that you have ſo unfurniſhed a mind, or ſo little to engage it. Read Hayley's truly humorous Eſſays on Old Maids, and bluſh at the practice. Remember the fate of the poor, unhappy <hi>ſpinſter,</hi> who caught her death by her immoderate curioſity.</p>
                     <p>You can ſurely find infinite ſubjects for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of an <hi>hour,</hi> without <hi>deſcending</hi> to theſe <hi>little</hi> things. If you <hi>cannot,</hi> it is high time to give up (what is only <hi>called</hi>) an amuſement,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023176_0168_0FBDDF5F653BFF68"/>for that, which is a <hi>real</hi> one, a walk, a ride, a book, a garden, or the ſociety of a choſen friend.</p>
                     <p>It is aſtoniſhing into how many difficulties a woman betrays herſelf, who is fond of this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; what quarrels, miſconſtructions, and expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, what ſecret ſhyneſſes, averſions, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs ſuch <hi>babblers</hi> create; what friends they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and what a badge of infamy they fix upon themſelves, in the eyes of all the ſenſible and the good!</p>
                     <p>There was a famous ſchool amongſt the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, where the pupils ſpent ſeveral years in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very neceſſary art of being <hi>ſilent.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, my dear girl, that nature has given you <hi>two</hi> ears, and only <hi>one</hi> tongue; and that ſcripture had ſaid, "be ſwift to hear, but ſlow to ſpeak."</p>

                     <p>CARDS, which are the inſeparable concomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of tea viſits, and introduced as ſoon as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are well ſeated in company, are a very equiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocal pleaſure, and, by no means, to be much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended.

                     <p>If experience did not convince us of the fact, one ſhould never have imagined, that a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> creature would ever have been able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume hours, days, weeks, months, years, in <hi>counting

                     <p>I will advert, no longer, to the <hi>moral</hi> conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. A woman, who has a wiſh only to <hi>pleaſe,</hi> ſhould not be much addicted to this practice. It is very apt to ruffle the temper, and <hi>diſcompoſe the features;</hi> and a ſour or an angry look is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to <hi>female</hi> charms, than an high ſcorbutic fluſh, or the ſmall-pox.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid in favour of cards, that they prevent <hi>ſcandal,</hi> and are a ſubſtitute to many, for the want of converſation. This conveys a ſevere ſtigma both on our hearts and underſtanding. It ſuppoſes, that we have few ſtores of entertainment <hi>within</hi> ourſelves; and that the only way to avoid a <hi>greater</hi> crime, is to fall into a <hi>leſs.</hi> Our moments, I fear, will not bear the ſcrutiny of conſcience or reaſon, much leſs of the great day, if we cannot contrive to ſpend them in an innocent and uſeful manner, without the <hi>low</hi> reſource of either <hi>ſcandal</hi> or <hi>play!</hi>

                     <p>THE <hi>defenders</hi> of cards, however, will ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in favour of <hi>gaming. No</hi> fortune, they know, is equal to its extravagant demands. An unlucky throw loſes thouſands in a moment. It has reduced the moſt opulent families to indigence; has led ſome to forgery, and an ignominious death; others, whoſe pride would not brook the <hi>degradation,</hi> to the fatal act of ſuicide; at beſt it has plunged into poverty and diſtreſs, many heirs of honourable and illuſtrious houſes, who were born, in all <hi>appearance</hi> to <hi>happier</hi> days.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>moderate</hi> card players (as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,) have often wondered, what can tempt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of fortune to ſuch a dreadful and ruinous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, as that of gaming. I will venture to ſay, that this ſhocking practice is nothing more, than the ſpirit of card playing, carried to its <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme;</hi> that equal temptations would probably have led <hi>them</hi> to the very ſame imprudence; that they both, <hi>generally,</hi> originate in the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (the want of ſomething ſubſtantial to fill and exerciſe the mind,) and are only an <hi>artificial</hi> meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of deſtroying that <hi>ennui</hi> and languor, which are the moſt inſupportable feelings of human life; and that the cure of <hi>both</hi> muſt, equally, ſpring from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid knowledge, and from ſolid virtue.</p>
                     <p>Though gaming, at <hi>firſt,</hi> riſes from no worſe a principle, than a want of amuſemet, or of having ſomething to call the paſſions into exerciſe, yet, in its <hi>conſequences,</hi> it has a tendency to eradicate every religious and moral diſpoſition, every ſocial
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023176_0171_0FBDDF63E7068250"/>duty, every laudable and virtuous affection. It renders the mind <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> in the extreme, and callous to the touch of woe, in every ſhape; whilſt it ſtops up the <hi>ſluices</hi> of charity, it extinguiſhes the <hi>inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for it; it is deaf to every call of friendſhip or of prudence. There can be no ſuch thing, as an attentive parent, mother, wife, brother, ſiſter or a ſympathizing heart, where this infernal rage has taken poſſeſſion of the ſoul. Every thing elſe is ſwallowed up in the <hi>all-devouring</hi> vortex. A game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would ſtake the laſt thouſand on a throw, though a <hi>priſon,</hi> for her <hi>huſband, rags</hi> for her <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> or a <hi>gallows</hi> for her neareſt <hi>friend,</hi> were the melancholy proſpect!</p>
                     <p>If you diſbelieve <hi>this</hi> reaſoning, look into life. What effects has this paſſion <hi>gradually</hi> produced on women, who had <hi>once</hi> hearts full of tenderneſs and virtue, and were affected with every appearance of diſtreſs; who had from <hi>nature,</hi> every refinement of taſte, and every elegance of manners to captivate and charm.</p>
                     <p>If it were not invidious, I could produce many <hi>living</hi> characters to ſupport my aſſertions. They would make a diſmal picture, and the motto would be, "beware of beginnings."</p>
                     <p>Though I abhor novels, yet, perhaps, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated one of Cecilia is worth reading, if it was only to guard our faſhionable ladies from ſplitting on the dreadful rock of the Harrels. Many cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, in that book, are overſtrained; but <hi>this</hi> is borrowed from real life, and daily obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>Without order, a thouſand things will be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly delayed, or wholly neglected. Whilſt we are heſitating where to <hi>begin,</hi> or <hi>what</hi> to do, hours fly away, <hi>inſenſibly,</hi> never to return!</p>

                     <p>If you are an <hi>early riſer,</hi> you may ſind time for <hi>every</hi> thing. It is amazing how much is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by lopping off an hour or two, from indulgence

                     <p>I do not know a practice which I ſhould <hi>more</hi> recommend, whether devotion, health, beauty, or improvement of the mind, were the objects in view. How cheerful and how animated are the meditations of the morning! What a delightful bloom fluſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What an unſpeakable cheerfulneſs glides into the ſould from hearing the devotional matins of the lark, and from beholding the new-born ſcenery of nature! How neceſſary is ſuch a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to preſerve that ſweetneſs of complexion, and of breath, which are the very eſſence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume of beauty!

                     <p>I have inured myſelf, for many years, to this habit of early riſing. In the ſpring months of April and May, particularly, I grudge every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is waſted after five.

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023176_0174_0FBDDF686514DFC8"/>think her a charming woman. She always ſtruck me as poſſeſſing, in a ſuperior degree, thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which conſtitute the <hi>graceful and attractive,</hi> and therefore as a very proper pattern to all young people. Not that I think a ſervile imitation of <hi>any</hi> original, however excellent, would render <hi>another</hi> pleaſing. Nature no more intended any two perſons to have preciſely the ſame <hi>manner,</hi> than the ſame eyes, or features, or complexion. But ſtill a <hi>familiar</hi> intimacy with ſuch a woman muſt <hi>inſenſibly</hi> communicate ſome traits of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, which by incorporating with the <hi>general</hi> maſs of a character, will form a beautiful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent whole.</p>
                     <p>Though I have always admired her only in the <hi>groſs,</hi> and was charmed, without conſidering the conſtituent principles of her excellence, I will, as you requeſt it, endeavour to <hi>analyze</hi> and trace them to their ſource.</p>
                     <p>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> perſon is rather <hi>genteel,</hi> than beautiful, ſo that ſhe is more indebted to herſelf, than to nature, for her attractions. And a wonderful energy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have. For I have often ſeen this girl ſteal the notice of the whole company from others of her ſex, who were infinitely more diſtinguiſhed by the beauty of their perſons, as well as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of birth and fortune.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ground work</hi> of all her charms, is, (what I cannot call by a better name, than that of) ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; an artleſs, undeſigning, <hi>unſtudied</hi> manner, flowing from an innocent and virtuous heart, which, ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>r ſeeks <hi>concealment,</hi> as having indeed <hi>nothing</hi> to conceal. Louiſa never affects to be any thing, but what ſhe <hi>is.</hi> She does not <hi>exalt</hi> herſelf
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023176_0175_0FBDDF69E512E7E0"/>above meaſure, nor ever ridiculouſly degrades herſelf, in order to be <hi>exalted.</hi> Her geſtures, atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, voice, pronunciation are all under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate impreſſion and guidance of <hi>nature.</hi> Louiſa <hi>expreſſes</hi> an innocent pleaſure, becauſe ſhe <hi>feels</hi> it in the company of ſenſible and agreeable men, and yet never ſeeks it with an improper avidity. She never harangues upon, or vaunts a <hi>ſuperior</hi> ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but frequently diſplays no <hi>inconſiderable</hi> ſhare of it, by <hi>involuntary</hi> emotions. She never, in any reſpect, affects connections, appearance or any thing <hi>above</hi> her fortune, nor endeavours to ſhine at the expence of others.</p>
                     <p>This, though very imperfectly deſcribed, is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my idea, the firſt excellence in the character of this lady. It is the very reverſe of that abſurd affectation, which, by aſſuming a thouſand, <hi>fanciful</hi> ſhapes, renders graces unlovely, and even beauty diſguſting. Louiſa charms every perſon, becauſe ſhe is <hi>always</hi> amiable and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without <hi>ſtudying</hi> to charm. Her face is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways welcome in company, though ſhe throws no <hi>artificial</hi> lightning into her eyes, ſoftneſs into her features, nor <hi>liſping</hi> into her articulation.</p>
                     <p>The common <hi>ſyſtematic</hi> education of girls is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable to this ſimplicity. The tendency of <hi>modern</hi> culture is to raiſe art, upon the ruins of nature. Such a method would not ſucceed in any thing <hi>elſe,</hi> and how ſhould it in the treatment of women? If there be one object in the world, more diſguſting than all others, it is a girl, whom nature formed to be innocent and artleſs, reducing affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſguiſe to a <hi>ſyſtem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is with ſimplicity of manner, as it is with eaſe of ſtyle, in a writer. When we read his
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023176_0176_0FBDDF6B65EE1158"/>works, it appears the moſt <hi>eaſy</hi> attainment imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but, in fact, nothing is ſo <hi>uncommon,</hi> either in conduct or in writings. And the reaſon muſt be, that, inſtead of attending to the guidance of nature, people make an extraordinary effort to be ſomething <hi>great,</hi> or <hi>ſuperior,</hi> and uncommon. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity may be ſtyled the eaſy and the graceful <hi>negligence</hi> of conduct, yet, as in dreſs, it charms more than the moſt elaborate ornaments.</p>
                     <p>Through all the wonderful works of God there is a majeſtic ſimplicity. Nature knows no <hi>affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Her proſpects, hills, vallies, alcoves, grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos are all unſtudied; her magnificence is wild and artleſs. There is a ſimplicity of deſign and effect in all her wonders, in the conſtruction and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of planets, in the flow and ebbing of the tides, and in the vomiting of immenſe volcanos. The carnation never aims at the ſtately magnificence of the oſtentatious hoary oak. Every roſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with its own natural hues and odours; and affects not the elegant ſweetneſs of the Reſeda, (minionette.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nature</hi> is the ſtandard of <hi>perfection.</hi> Every character and every art is only ſo far finiſhed, as it approaches to her likeneſs. No paintings are beautiful without this ground-work of <hi>ſimplicity.</hi> It charms in a Correggio. It was the excellence of a Raphael. It lives in the exquiſite touches of a Reynolds.</p>
                     <p>The beauty of all <hi>writing</hi> is founded in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. It was with Homer, Virgil and Milton, when they ſketched out their inimitable poems. Of Shakeſpeare it was the very ſoul. Statuaries, ſculptors, architects have only gained an extenſive
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023176_0177_0FBDDF6CE556EA08"/>reputation, in proportion as they have ſtudied this <hi>divine</hi> ſimplicity.</p>
                     <p>No woman can be graceful without it. It will go further, in the art of pleaſing, without <hi>any</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, than <hi>all</hi> the accompliſhments will go, without it.</p>

                     <p>Cheerfulneſs (ſaith the wiſe man) doeth good, like a medicine. It has a wonderful effect on all

It is the trueſt policy to be <hi>innocently</hi> gay and cheerful, whilſt we <hi>can.</hi> It for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the approach of wrinkles, and adds many years to the little fleeting ſpan of human life. Some pietiſts have encouraged gloom by their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous notions of the Deity, and of chriſtian ſelf-denial. But I ſhould ſtrongly ſuſpect their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or their judgment.

Nor is it, that ſhe has reduced rules of propriety to a ſyſtem. She has really a <hi>native</hi> feeling, which vibrates to the moſt diſtant touch of what is proper and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, and would tremble, like the ſenſitive plant, where any thing, that could ſtain the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of her <hi>mind,</hi> was conveyed in the moſt <hi>diſtant</hi> alluſion.</p>
                     <p>Faſhionable manners have been long attempting to baniſh delicacy, as a ſort of <hi>incumbrance;</hi> but no woman will ever <hi>long</hi> be lovely without it. Let France or Italy do what they will, it is that ſacred fence, which is never broken down, without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy conſequences. Delicacy is a very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and <hi>comprehenſive</hi> quality. It extends to every thing, where woman is coneerned. Converſation, books, pictures, attitude, geſture, pronunciation, ſhould all be under its ſalutary reſtraints. If a girl ever loſes it, farewel, a long farewel to all her greatneſs! If this "ſalt have loſt its ſavour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall it be ſeaſoned?"</p>
                     <p>How unfit are many parents to educate a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! What injudicious pleaſantries do they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſe, even in their preſence! A girl ſhould <hi>hear,</hi> ſhe ſhould <hi>ſee,</hi> nothing, that can call forth a bluſh, or even ſtain the <hi>purity</hi> of her mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Another diſtinguiſhing grace</hi> of Louiſa is <hi>ſoftneſs.</hi> She is (what <hi>nature</hi> intended her <hi>to</hi> be,) <hi>wholly</hi> a woman. She has a quality, that is the direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to <hi>manlineſs and vigour.</hi> Her voice is gentle; her pronunciation delicate; her paſſions
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023176_0180_0FBDDF7164F97828"/>are never ſuffered to be <hi>boiſterous:</hi> ſhe never talks politics: ſhe never foams with anger: ſhe is ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen in any <hi>maſculine</hi> amuſements: ſhe does not practiſe <hi>archery.</hi> I will venture to propheſy, that ſhe will never canvaſs for votes at an election. I never ſaw her in an <hi>unfeminine</hi> dreſs, or her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, diſcompoſed with play. She <hi>really</hi> trembles with the apprehenſion of danger. She feels, <hi>unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly,</hi> for every perſon, expoſed to it. A friend, leaving her father's houſe, only for a ſhort time, calls forth her concern. The farewel tear ſtands big in its tranſparent ſluice. And whenever he returns, the eaſy, <hi>undiſſembled</hi> ſmile teſtifies her joy. She diſplays more ſymphathy for the <hi>indiſpoſition</hi> of a <hi>ſervant,</hi> than ſome do for the <hi>death</hi> of their neareſt <hi>friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of all the women I ever ſaw, Louiſa has the moſt univerſal and indiſcriminate <hi>affability.</hi> She never meets any poor perſons in her neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, without entering into a very minute inquiry about the health of their children, family and friends; and the villagers <hi>revere</hi> her. They know that ſhe is conſtantly planning for them ſome aſſiſtance and relief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Little</hi> minds endeavour to ſupport a conſequence by <hi>diſtance</hi> and <hi>hauteur.</hi> But this is a miſtake. <hi>True</hi> dignity ariſes from condeſcenſion, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by noble actions.</p>
                     <p>Superciliouſneſs is almoſt a certain mark of low birth, and ill breeding. People, who have juſt emerged into greatneſs, think it neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their ſuperiority by a proud look and an high ſtomach. The conſequence is <hi>general</hi> hatred and contempt.</p>
                     <p>In fact this proud, <hi>high-bearing</hi> reſerve is a very
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023176_0181_0FBDDF72E6A7B0E0"/>great <hi>crime.</hi> Every perſon, that bears the image of his Maker, is entitled to our attentions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our benevolence. Inferiority is, of <hi>itſelf,</hi> a ſufficient burden, without our endeavouring to <hi>aggravate</hi> it by ill-nature or neglect.</p>
                     <p>I have often heard Louiſa dwell, with rapture, on the entertainment and <hi>edification</hi> ſhe has receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many <hi>cottages</hi> when ſhe has been carrying clothing, cordials or money to the diſtreſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and tell me which is the more digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied character? a woman, who would turn from her poor neighbours with diſdain, or one, who for her kindneſs and attention to them, is praiſed, as often as her name is mentioned, and followed, whitherſoever ſhe moveth, with their tears and with their bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>There is not a greater charm in any character, than ſuch a <hi>condeſcenſion.</hi> A woman, thus forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all her diſtinctions, to ſympathize with the unfortunate, muſt captivate every man, who has either a ſingle grain of piety or underſtanding. Even the <hi>plaineſt face</hi> would be forgotten in ſuch real and unaffected goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>manner</hi> of Louiſa <hi>finiſhes</hi> her character. It is a beautiful bordering to all her graces and her virtues. It is impoſſible for me to define, (what I mean by,) manner; yet no one can be, half an hour, in the company of this lady, without feeling its aſtoniſhing effects. Though ſhe frequently ſays nothing, but what might have dropped from any other perſon, yet in <hi>her</hi> it becomes ſo very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, as to command attention, and even to delight. She embelliſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <pb n="31" facs="unknown:023176_0182_0FBDDF7466B600F0"/>civility. She heightens every favour by the <hi>mode</hi> of doing it, and ſhe oblige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The beſt definition I can give of this quality muſt be imperfect.

What could equal the heartfelt joys I derive from the fond and ever <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> attachment of my Harriet, or the pleaſure of watching the continually expanding graces and improvements of my lovely girl?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It has, long, been my private opinion, that a good clergyman is more likely to have a dutiful and affectionate family, than a perſon of almoſt any other character. And I am not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in it by the inſtance before us.</p>
                     <p>Whoever ſees this happy pair, is delighted with that mutual eſteem and fondneſs, which revolving years have not been able to diminiſh, but only to mature; and muſt form a very high idea of that union, which the <hi>licentious</hi> only endeavour to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, becauſe they have not taſte and innocence enough for its <hi>unpurchaſed,</hi> and refined ſweets.

Fortunately for my friend, a comfortable, <hi>pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> fortune, in conjunction with that, which he received with his lady, has placed him in very eaſy, and rather affluent, circumſtances. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has crowned their virtuous friendſhip only with Louiſa; but indeed, in her alone, has rained down a <hi>profuſion</hi> of its bleſſings. In her, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all their cares and anxieties concenter; and her education, you may well ſuppoſe, has not been neglected.</p>
                     <p>Her parents are both averſe to boarding ſchools, as inſpiring a young perſon with improper notions, and undermining the taſte for pure ſimplicity and domeſtic worth. She has, therefore, been always kept under their own, immediate inſpection; but her hours are as ſtrictly arranged, as they could have been, at any ſchool, into a <hi>regular</hi> plan of employment. She has her allotted intervals for domeſtic duties, needle-work, reading, correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, exerciſe and recreation; and every hour knows its particular engagement.</p>
                     <p>She opens every morning, and cloſes every day with an hymn of praiſe to her bountiful Creator, which is chanted to the harpſichord, with ſo ſweet a voice, as I cannot even at this diſtance of time, recollect without emotion.</p>
                     <p>If you ſaw the beautiful <hi>fancy-work,</hi> which has been wrought by this girl, in carpers, baſkets of flowers, embroidery, &amp;c. you would imagine, that ſhe could have but little leiſure for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her underſtanding. But a ſtrict <hi>economy</hi> of time, an invariable adherence to <hi>order,</hi> and an habit of <hi>early riſing</hi> have enabled her to do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Her father ſuperintends that part of her education, which is connected with books; and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023176_0185_0FBDDF78E60D3DD0"/>has ſuch an happy method of conveying his idea as wonderfully mixes inſtruction with delight.</p>
                     <p>Natural hiſtory and botany, on fine days, they ſtudy in the <hi>fields;</hi> and when the weather is leſs favourable, ſhe has ſuch a collection of animals, inſects, and other curioſities as would adorn the muſeum of a connoiſſeur. This is called her grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and is placed in a ſhady part of the garden, over-arched with an alcove of entwined elms.</p>
                     <p>Hiſtory, in the hands of her able inſtructor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a fund of unſpeakable improvement. When events are recorded, ſhe is aſked what <hi>cauſes</hi> gave them birth; what <hi>inſtruments</hi> were made uſe of for their completion, and what traces ſhe can diſcover, of a wonderful and an all-wiſe Providence, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole.</p>
                     <p>Geography and chronology are inſeparable guides conſulted on the occaſion; and when <hi>characters</hi> are deſcribed, ſhe is interrogated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>praiſe-worthy</hi> or the <hi>reprehenſible,</hi> in them; where the hiſtorian has been too ſparing of his praiſe, or extolled beyond the bounds of reaſon and of <hi>truth.</hi> Her ſentiments, on all theſe ſubjects, are given, in her own language, upon paper; and afterwards corrected by the mature judgment and critical taſte of her incomparable tutor.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Sundays,</hi> ſhe prepares a conciſe abridgment of the ſermon, which undergoes the ſame rigid examination; and ſhe has a little volume, filled with ſuch ſacred reflections, as would not diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the underſtanding, or the repoſitory of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed divine.</p>
                     <p>You would ſuppoſe from <hi>this</hi> account, that Louiſa would appear (what the world calls,) a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023176_0186_0FBDDF7A6578B660"/>very <hi>learned woman.</hi> No ſuch thing. In a <hi>mixed</hi> company, you would not diſcern, that ſhe poſſeſſed any ſuperior knowledge or advantage over her ſex, except in an elegant mode of expreſſion. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into other people's views, feelings, intereſts and concerns, with a politeneſs, that very few poſſeſs; and converſes with all her country neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, on ſuch eaſy terms, as baniſh every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant feeling of diſtance or reſtraint.</p>
                     <p>The heart of this lovely girl is, all over, <hi>ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſoftneſs.</hi> The big tear trembles in her eye, on every trying occaſion; and in her cloſet, along with a ſmall, but well choſen collection of books, ſhe has a little box, with this inſcription, "ſacred to the poor." Into <hi>this,</hi> ſhe puts, every night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſleeps, ſomething to be a fund for merit and diſtreſs. She enriches it with the ſavings ſhe has made, by retrenching ſome expenſive articles of dreſs or pleaſure. It is filled with money, that others would have ſpent on plays, concerts or aſſemblies; and I will venture to ſay, that ſhe has infinitely ſweeter muſic in her heart, and a more innocent, ſparkling brilliance in her eyes, than any of the moſt admired frequenters of theſe gay amuſements.</p>

                     <p>FROM Louiſa's ſtrict conſinement and <hi>ſyſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic</hi> life you would conclude, perhaps, that ſhe had almoſt contracted a <hi>diſreliſh</hi> for books. But, indeed, it is far otherwiſe; her ſtudies are her
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023176_0187_0FBDDF7BE4B97D40"/>
                        <hi>pleaſure;</hi> they are ſo judiciouſly mixed with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and ſo interwoven, as it were, with the common caſual occurrences of the day, that ſhe conſiders them more as an <hi>amuſement,</hi> than a <hi>buſineſs.</hi> Her private moments, when ſhe is left to her own choice, are not unfrequently beguiled with the very ſame employments, which had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed the other parts of the day.</p>
                     <p>The garden is the ſcene, where ſhe indulges all the luxury of her taſte; and her rambles into it are as frequent, as the great variety of her avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will permit. One day, I found her in this retizement. The place was very happily fancied. Large clumps of trees, on both ſides, with their intervening foliage, had rendered it impervious to any human eye. Nature had wantoned with particular luxuriance. A clear, tranſparent ſpring murmured through the valley. And it was fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on both ſides, with a very lofty mound, caſt up as on purpoſe, and planted with perennial ſhrubs. A ſhady arbour, in the middle, catching through a beautiful viſta, the ſpire of the village church, invited to meditation and to repoſe. She was reclined here rather in a penſive attitude, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Burke's Eſſays on the Beautiful and Sublime; and to me ſhe appeared, I muſt confeſs, more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting, more <hi>beautiful</hi> and more <hi>ſublime,</hi> than the admired work of that well known and admired author.</p>
                     <p>On another occaſion, her mother being much indiſpoſed, ſhe had ſtolen from the domeſtic circle, to indulge, at leiſure, a ſolitary grief. The book ſhe held in her hands, was Lord Lyttleton's Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of the Dead. The ſoft melancholy viſible in her countenance, the very apparent agitation of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023176_0188_0FBDDF7D6611E920"/>her ſpirits, and the grief, burſting through her animated eyes, formed a very intereſting whole; whilſt her obſervations on a future life, on the comfort ſhe derived from the hope of converſing with her friends after death; on the probable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and happineſs of heaven, and the permanency of virtuous friendſhip and affection, would no have diſgraced any divine or philoſopher of the age.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>third</hi> time of her elopement, ſhe was reading the only novel, which ſhe permits herſelf <hi>to</hi> read, that of Sir Charles Grandiſon. Tears, like an April ſhower, tinged with the ſun, were mingled with her joy.</p>
                     <p>The book was opened, where the once-amiable Harriet Byron is <hi>now</hi> Lady Grandiſon; where the painful ſuſpenſe of her virtuous, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature, attachment, is crowned by an eternal union with its object, and ſhe is kneeling to her ever-venerable grandmother, to implore a bleſſing. "Heavens!" (ſaid ſhe,) <q>what an exquiſite and inimitable painter was Richardſon! How over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whemled with admiration, eſteem and ſelf-annihilation do I, always, feel myſelf, when I read the deſcription of his Harriet Byron. So much piety, yet ſo much cheerfulneſs; ſuch filial duty, tenderneſs, affection, ſo exquiſite a ſenſibility; ſo deep and glowing a paſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with ſo much delicacy; ſuch beauty of perſon, loſt in ſo much greater ſweetneſs of temper, and ſuch a winning candour and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, complete my idea of every thing that is noble and aimable in woman.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I never read this writer without weeping. He had an amazing talent for the pathetic and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023176_0189_0FBDDF7EE6F868F0"/>deſcriptive. He opens all the ſluices of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tears flow down our cheeks, like a river. And (what is moſt of all,) I never open his book without feeling my ſentiments elevated and ſublimed, and my heart more alive to all the ſuggeſtions of piety and virtue. If <hi>all</hi> novels had been written on ſuch a plan, they would, doubtleſs, have been very excellent vehicles of wiſdom and goodneſs.</q>

                     <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> time I broke in upon Louiſa's retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe was <hi>ſurrounded</hi> with authors. She ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bent upon indulging her elegant taſte, in all its extravagance.</p>
                     <p>Addiſon's papers on the Pleaſures of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſeveral pieces of Miſs Seward: Maſon's Engliſh Garden; Arioſto, with Hoole's Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Webb's Inquiry into the Beauties of Painting, together with a Collection of Poems, lay, in promiſcuous dignity, beſide her. She has accuſtomed herſelf to enter into a ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place book, paſſages, which ſhe thinks parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſtriking. I am happy in being able to give you a little ſpecimen of her choice, for ſhe indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with a ſight of the valuable manuſcript.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, poetical roſe ſhe had plucked, was from the Italian poet, Arioſto. It was his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful picture of Alcina, the enchantreſs. I will tranſcribe a few of the lines, and the tranſlation, though a modeſt bluſh tinged her cheeks, whilſt I read the deſcription.</p>

                     <p>The ever graceful and elegant Fontaine, ſo juſtly eſteemed the Correggio of poetry, had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied her with the fables of Le Chene et le Roſeau, La Fille; and from the theatre <hi>Sur l' Education</hi> of the Comteſſe le Genlis, ſhe had ſtolen the fragrant roſe of Salency.</p>

                     <p>I WILL now give you another picture.

But I will not undertake to ſay, that the features will pleaſe you. They are certainly different from thoſe of Louiſa.</p>
                     <p>She was almoſt inceſſantly practiſing little arts, and adjuſting all her airs and graces to engage ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. When ſhe ſpoke, ſhe minced her ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and when ſhe <hi>looked,</hi> ſhe threw an <hi>unnatural</hi> vivacity into her eyes. She is a fine, blooming girl; and, if ſhe had not taken ſuch uncommon
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:023176_0193_0FBDDF84E7CA5338"/>
                        <hi>pains</hi> to pleaſe, muſt neceſſarily have charmed every beholder.</p>
                     <p>How long will it be before people learn, that nothing engages ſo much, as the eaſe of nature? An artleſs <hi>ſimplicity</hi> is the higheſt charm. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>ſludies</hi> admiration, raiſes diſguſt. Syſtem and conſtraint deſtroy <hi>eaſe.</hi> And eaſe is the parent of all the graces.</p>
                     <p>It is the buſineſs of education to lop off ſome little, <hi>luxuriant</hi> boughs from the tree of nature, but not to <hi>conſtrain</hi> it, that it cannot vegetate, or give to every branch, an <hi>unnatural</hi> direction. I ſhould prefer the plain, honeſt awkwardneſs of a more country girl to over-acted refinement.</p>
                     <p>Though Lady Harriet—is not yet four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, ſhe has more than the airs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of a woman. Who can have taught this girl, that roſes are expected to open <hi>all at once,</hi> and not by degrees?</p>
                     <p>Timidity and diffidence are the moſt attracting qualities of a girl; a countenance always modeſt, and undeſigning; a tongue, often ſilent, and ears, always attentive.</p>
                     <p>Boarding ſchools, it ſhould ſeem, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>hot-beds.</hi> They bring fruits and flowers quickly to their growth. But they have not their proper eſſence, healthineſs or flavour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>girliſh</hi> ſtate is ſo pleaſing, in itſelf, that we wiſh not to ſee it exchanged, before its time, for the caution, the artifices, or the ſubtil policy of age.</p>
                     <p>It is deſirable, that a girl ſhould retain, as long as poſſible, the innocent dreſs, manners, habit and ſentiments of childhood. She will never be more captivating, when ſhe is a woman. Natural,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:023176_0194_0FBDDF8664BD51B8"/>
                        <hi>untortured</hi> ringlets, ſaſhes, frocks, &amp;c. are ſuperior to all the laboured trappings of faſhion. Nature has given to every <hi>age,</hi> as well as to every <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of the year, its <hi>appropriate</hi> charms. We ſhould be greatly diſappointed, if the ſoft breezes and the pleaſing, new born ſcenery of the ſpring were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to diſſolve into the ſultry heats of ſummer.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>forward</hi> girl always alarms me. Indelicacy, imprudence and improper connections ſtart up to my view. I tremble for her friends, and ſee her hiſtory, <hi>gradually,</hi> unfolding into indiſcretion.</p>
                     <p>Children are apt enough, of <hi>themſelves,</hi> to aſpire into womanhood. A governeſs ſhould <hi>check</hi> this ſpirit, and nip it in the bud. A long nonage, if I may ſo call it, is ſavourable to your ſex. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>this</hi> period, a girl is acquiring ſome <hi>ſolid</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. When ſhe fancies herſelf a woman, company, pleaſures and converſation with the other ſex, <hi>unhinge</hi> her mind, and bid unquiet thoughts take poſſeſſion of her fancy.</p>
                     <p>I could diſcover from the converſation of Lady Harriet, that ſhe was deeply read in novels and romances. Her expreſſions were beyond nature, turgid and overſtrained, where ſhe only wiſhed to convey a <hi>common</hi> idea.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>volume</hi> would not be ſufficient to expoſe the dangers of theſe books. They lead young people into an <hi>enchanted</hi> country, and open to their view an <hi>imaginable</hi> world, full of inviolable friendſhips, attachments, ecſtacies, accompliſhments, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and ſuch viſionary joys, as never will be realized in the <hi>coarſeneſs</hi> of common life. The romantic turn, they create, indiſpoſes for every thing that is <hi>rational</hi> or ſubſtantial. They corrupt all <hi>principle.</hi> Fortitude they unnerve, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

Their <hi>ſentiment</hi> is but a fine-ſpun word for <hi>indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> emotions. Their <hi>ſympathy and friendſhip</hi> are often but a ſpecious, flimſy covering for <hi>criminal</hi> attachments. Such falſe, over-ſtrained ideas have led many a poor girl to <hi>ruin.</hi> Under the notion of <hi>ſuperior refinement, ſimilarity of ſouls,</hi> and <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary friendſhip,</hi> ſhe has gradually been ſeduced from the paths of virtue, to the commiſſion of the groſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Plays, operas, maſquerades, and all the other faſhionable pleaſures have not half ſo much danger to young people, as the reading of theſe books. With <hi>them,</hi> the moſt delicate girl can entertain herſelf, in <hi>private,</hi> without any cenſure; and the poiſon operates, more forcibly, becauſe unperceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The moſt profligate villain, that was bent on the infernal purpoſe of ſeducing a woman, could not wiſh a ſymptom, more favourable to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than an imagination, inflamed with the rhapſodies of novels.</p>
                     <p>Lady H— betrayed great <hi>pride,</hi> in diſavowing any acquaintance with ſome young ladies, at the ſame ſchool, becauſe their parents were not equal to hers in point of fortune. She had formed, poor girl wrong notions of importance; and they had not, it ſhould ſeem, been properly corrected.</p>
                     <p>Under the idea of teaching young people, what is due to their rank, boarding ſchools encourage

                     <p>Alas! my dear girl, what have any of us to boaſt of? What dignity is there in an heap of money, unleſs it be devoted to charitable actions? To be carried in ſtate, to eat <hi>deliciouſly,</hi> or to ſleep on <hi>down,</hi> may have ſomething in it, to <hi>weak mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> that elevates and charms; but to an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of heaven, or to ſuperior ſpirits, muſt be as frivolous, as the toils or little play things of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren appear to <hi>us.</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023176_0197_0FBDDF8AE6D4A898"/>of doing a religious action, is content to "become the ſervant of all." This love will be a ſovereign balſam to the ſoul. It will heal a thouſand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and <hi>prevent</hi> as many more.</p>
                     <p>The Author of all wiſdom and greatneſs was "meek and lowly in heart." He, who could have <hi>commanded</hi> kingdoms, inhabited a cottage. Humility is the <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> badge of his religion. And, whenever you are his <hi>real</hi> diſciple, you will not exalt yourſelf above the meaneſt creature, but under an accumulation of all worldly diſtinctions, will ſmite upon your breaſt with the publican, and ſay, "God be merciful to me a ſinner."</p>

                     <p>Pride is contrary to every thing, that <hi>pleaſes</hi> in a woman. It has no ſoftneſs, no benignity, no eaſe.

                     </opener>
                     <p>I GAVE you a deſcription of the <hi>true</hi> delicacy of Louiſa. I have lately ſeen it over-acted by <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> perſon, in ſuch a manner, as to diſguſt me beyond expreſſion. The virtues and graces have
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023176_0198_0FBDDF8C672214E8"/>all their limits. If puſhed further, they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into the very oppoſite defects. The lady, who hurt my feelings, had not <hi>conſidered</hi> this max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im. Or ſhe had not taſte and ſenſe enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it. <hi>Her</hi> delicacy was abſolute <hi>prudery and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True delicacy is nothing more, than the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>modeſty.</hi> It is the ſenſitive plant of woman, which gives the quickeſt notice of approaching danger, and trembles at the bare <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of any thing, which can injure her honour, her ſafety, or repoſe. So amiable in itſelf, one cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that every female wiſhes to be thought in poſſeſſion of it. But it is a ſhy and timid plant, and leaſt diſplays itſelf, where it is known to exiſt in the higheſt cultivation.</p>
                     <p>Some women are ſo <hi>over-loaden</hi> with this virtue, as to be almoſt inſufferable in ſociety; ſo <hi>outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> virtuous, that they render all their purity and principles ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>tremblingly</hi> modeſt female, in a company, of which I had lately the honour of making one, on hearing that a number of gentlemen were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drink tea, ſeemed very much alarmed, and pretended to make an apology for retiring. Now this was nothing leſs than downright <hi>hypocriſy.</hi> If it had been poſſible to look into her heart, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, at the very moment, it was thrilling with joy, for the agreable information.</p>
                     <p>Every woman in the world is fond of our ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unleſs ſhe had formed ſome <hi>particular</hi> attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wiſhes to indulge the greater luxury of ſolitary recollection. It is a <hi>natural</hi> and an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſure, and it would be the <hi>falſeſt</hi> delicacy to diſown it. We always <hi>ſuſpect</hi> theſe prudes.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023176_0199_0FBDDF8DE5157050"/>We fancy, that their modeſty diminiſhes in private in proportion, as it appears to dilate and to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify itſelf, before the public inſpection.</p>
                     <p>Upon hearing, again, that a young lady had been ſmart and lively with a gentleman of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, ſhe <hi>bleſſed her ſtars,</hi> and wondered, how ſuch forwardneſs eſcaped <hi>reprobation!</hi> Now this girl acted from <hi>nature.</hi> The gentleman was agreeable. She felt the pleaſure. She dared to expreſs it. She wiſhed to entertain him, and ſhe did right. The other blamed her from envy or from affectation.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>over-nice</hi> and <hi>over-virtuous</hi> people would do well to conſider, that an odious reſtraint would baniſh all the ſweets of an intercourſe betwixt the ſexes, and fix a moping and a diſmal gloom on the face of the creation. It is no breach of true deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to comply with the innocent dictates of <hi>nature.</hi> A woman may, very modeſtly, avow a virtuous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. She may expreſs an approbation of particular men, and do juſtice to their merit. She may ſhew a fondneſs for being in their company. She may chat, in a ſociable and an eaſy manner with them; nay ſhe may think of being a <hi>wife</hi> or a <hi>mother,</hi> without injuring the fineſt tints of this laudable quality. Providence intended her for ſuch circumſtances and connections, and they need not a <hi>bluſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>piety</hi> is moſt ſolid, which affects no gloomy rigours, or ſingularities; which makes no noiſe, and courts no obſervation. It is ſo with delicacy. <hi>That</hi> is <hi>always</hi> the moſt exquiſite, which is leaſt <hi>oſtentatious.</hi> An <hi>unſtudied</hi> openneſs and ſimplicity of manners are the ſtrongeſt ſymptoms of a guiltleſs heart, and a virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>s intention. Thoſe young
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023176_0200_0FBDDF8F6580BD10"/>people are, generally the moſt amiable, that are moſt undiſguiſed. Having nothing to <hi>conceal,</hi> they have ſtudied no <hi>art.</hi> They may, <hi>ſometimes,</hi> give way to little ſallies, which the <hi>rigid</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn; but they are ſallies of good <hi>humour,</hi> and generoſity forgives them.</p>
                     <p>Another inſtance, in which this Lady offended me, and yet from an <hi>over</hi> deſire of pleaſing, was by aſſuming a miſtaken dignity. In fact, true dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in any perſon, conſiſts in the <hi>virtues;</hi> humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, condeſcenſion, candour; and is only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>great</hi> qualities, or by a train of amiable actions. But in a <hi>woman's</hi> manner, if ſhe conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered only what is <hi>graceful,</hi> there ſhould always be more of the lovely, than the great; of the enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, than the magnificent or ſublime. Her <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> ſhould be loſt in <hi>ſweetneſs;</hi> the dazzling, in the mild.</p>
                     <p>Women were not formed to <hi>awe</hi> us by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, but to <hi>ſooth</hi> us by their graces. We may be ſtruck with a Cleopatra, but we <hi>love</hi> an Antiope. A Catharine may <hi>aſtoniſh</hi> us, but we are <hi>charmed</hi> with a — C — e.</p>

                     <p>THE tour of affectation is unbounded. I have juſt returned from a circle of ladies, who have been entertaining me with a very long harangue, on (what they chooſe to call,) <hi>fine feelings.</hi> This is quite a faſhionable ſubject. The truth is, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023176_0201_0FBDDF90E53D7A50"/>is conſidered, as a matter of refinement, and a proof of being raiſed above the vulgar; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young people, I do believe, would be more hurt by any reflection on their ſenſibility, than if you ſuſpected their piety and virtue.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>rage</hi> for the compliment of fine feelings ſeems to have originated in the writings of Sterne. His very eccentric talents were always contriving ſome fictitious tale of woe, and bidding the tear to drop; the general circulation of his works, and the novels which have, ſince, ſprung up in the <hi>hot-bed</hi> of France, and of our own <hi>imaginations,</hi> have led young people to fancy every grace and almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtue, comprized under this ſpecious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive name.</p>
                     <p>Nothing certainly can be more nauſeous and diſguſting, than an <hi>affected</hi> ſenſibility, as nothing is more charming, than the pure and genuine. But, with all this <hi>noiſe</hi> about it, I am far from knowing whether there is much of the real in the world. They, who would be thought to have it in perfection, are only in poſſeſſion of the <hi>artificial.</hi> For is it ſenſibility to prefer the turbid pleaſures of <hi>midnight</hi> to opening buds and bloſſoms; to the leſſons, which the Creator gives in every vegetable and every inſect; to undiſturbed contemplation; to the raptures of devotion, or all the fair and enchanting landſcapes of creation; to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the taſte and knowledge, that are diſplayed in the works of the moſt learned and ingenious men, or the entertainment and delight and profit, we might receive from the volume of revelation? Is it ſenſibility to form a ſacred connection with one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and encourage a criminal attachment to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Is it ſenſibility to leave the charms, the cries, the wants and tender pleadings of an infant offs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023176_0202_0FBDDF9265246C40"/>for the vain and periſhable ſplendour of a ball, a birth-night, or a levee?</p>
                     <p>Every <hi>thinking</hi> perſon muſt be diſguſted with <hi>ſuch</hi> a kind of ſenſibility. Rigid criticiſm would call it by a very harſh name, and ſociety has reaſon to reprobate its tendency. Yet Sterne's ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty led to many of theſe evils; and who knows not, that a thouſand ladies, who <hi>vaunt fine</hi> feelings, are dupes to this ridiculous illuſion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>True</hi> feeling is of a very different complexion. Like genius, it muſt come from <hi>heaven;</hi> indeed it is a part <hi>of</hi> genius; and, like that, is very rare. It depends, conſiderably on temperament and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization; is much heightened by particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of education, ſociety, friends, reading. obſervation and reflection; and will generally be quickeſt in the moſt elevated minds. But, even when it is moſt gennine and poignant, it will never be a guide, ſafely to be truſted, till it is governed by reaſon, checked by diſcretion, and moulded by that religion, which requires us to devote every <hi>inſtinct</hi> we have, to the glory of God, and to the happineſs of all our fellow-creatures, and of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>conſecrated,</hi> it is a ſource of the pureſt and the richeſt bleſſings. It is the parent of an earneſt devotion to him, who gave it, and of a thouſand bleſſings to mankind. It <hi>appropriates</hi> all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of its brethren; it feels in every woe, <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices with them, that do rejoice, and weeps with them that weep;</q> and doubly alive to all the exerciſes, of piety, in bloſſoms, in flowers, in minerals, in vegetables, in ſtars, in planets, in the azure vault of heaven, in thunders, in ſtorms, in earthquakes, in volcanos, in the revolutions of
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023176_0203_0FBDDF93E65D6170"/>empire, and deſtruction of cities, feels more exqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely, adores and loves and venerates the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the power, the goodneſs and wonders of an all-preſent, and all diſpoſing God.</p>
                     <p>It is with this, as with every other grace and virtue. There is a falſe and a true. The falſe is loud and noiſy, much addicted to <hi>egotiſm,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes itſelf on public obſervation in order to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify its own conceit and vanity; the other, modeſt, timid, retired <hi>ſhrinks</hi> into itſelf; feels, but ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its feelings; ſuffers, but conceals its ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; rejoices, but does not vaunt its joy, and is too <hi>delicate</hi> in its nature, and too much <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted</hi> to ſolicit pity, or to court approbation. The one is an humble fire work, which cracks an ſparkles; the other is that lightning, which, in an <hi>inſtant,</hi> electrifies and ſhocks; this is the offs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring of heaven; that, the artificial creature of the world.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude this letter with a contraſt taken from life. Flavia lies in bed till noon; as ſoon as ſhe riſes, ſhe opens a novel, or a play-book; weeps profuſely at <hi>imaginary</hi> diſtreſs, ſips ſtrong tea, till ſhe is almoſt in hyſterics; concludes, that ſenſibility is all her own, and is perpetually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining how her feelings are ſhocked with ſuch a room, or ſuch a proſpect, the coarſeneſs of <hi>this</hi> character, and of <hi>that</hi> converſation, and how the ſight of a poor beggar gives her the <hi>vapours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Emily never ſays a word about her feelings, riſes with the dawn, endeavours to fortify her body with air and exerciſe, and her mind with devotion; is oftener ſeen with her <hi>bible,</hi> than any other book; ſeems pleaſed with every perſon and every object about her, and puts on a cheerful ſmile, when her

                     <p>I WILL give you candidly, at your requeſt, my opinion of ſome celebrated writers.

At any rate, it will ſerve to exerciſe your own judgment and diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Voltaire is a graceful, but a <hi>ſuperficial</hi> writer. He had more taſte than genius, and more livelineſs than authenticity. Volatile in his reſearches, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023176_0205_0FBDDF96E5411FE8"/>of inveſtigation and haſty in his deciſions, you can ſcarcely rely on the truth or authority of any facts, he relates.</p>
                     <p>If I muſt recommend <hi>any</hi> of his works, it ſhould be his Henriade. But I do not wiſh you to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate any cloſe acquaintance with ſo erroneous, and ſeductive an author.</p>
                     <p>Rouſſeau is very fanciful, but very engaging. His whims are all the ebullitions of genius; and, as ſuch, they pleaſe. Nothing was ever ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly romantic, as his Emilius, or ſyſtem of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a mere, <hi>paper</hi> edifice of children, which the firſt and gentleſt touch of experience totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys. You may read it to be amuſed, not to be inſtructed.</p>
                     <p>Why, you will naturally aſk, were theſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed men enemies to revelation? The truth is, genius diſdains to move in ſhackles, or to tread <hi>beaten</hi> paths. Originality is its conſtant aim. It muſt candidly, be owned, that revelation has ſome doctrines, <hi>ſuperior</hi> to our reaſon. Otherwiſe, we ſhould have no exerciſe for our faith; and our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of perception would be too ſubtile and too refined for a mortal ſtate. And theſe very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened men chooſe not to ſtop at <hi>myſteries,</hi> but, in the pride of underſtanding, arrogantly diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they cannot <hi>comprehend.</hi>

                     <p>AFTER all the noiſe, that has been made about him, what has this great Lord Cheſterfield writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? What <hi>new</hi> ideas has he communicated to the world?</p>
                     <p>He has given us a few ſketches of heathen my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology, of the Grecian, Roman and Engliſh, hiſtories, written in a pleaſing ſtyle; and he has inculcated upon youth, that excellent maxim, of not looſing a ſingle moment from improvement. A man of very <hi>moderate</hi> talents might have done like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. He had doubtleſs, ſome claim to taſte; but very little ſtrength or originality of genius appears through his writing, but he was a <hi>nobleman,</hi> who had been conſpicuous for his ſtation, and his coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net had reflected a luſtre on his page.</p>
                     <p>What real critic muſt not ſmile at his deciſion, when he boldly pronounces the <hi>Henriade</hi> of Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, ſuperior to the Iliad, the Aeneid, and to Paradiſe Loſt? Perhaps, this poem may be free from ſome, little <hi>ſpots</hi> of the others; but then it is not a ſun, whoſe fire conſumes every ſlighter blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and leaves the reader wrapped in a profound enthuſiaſm and amazement.</p>
                     <p>If it ſurpaſſes them in a cold correctneſs, has it their ſublimity, their energy and fire? If it has not their excreſcences, has it their impaſſioned beauties? Compared with the Iliad, or with the work of Milton, it is a neat ſpruce ſir, placed near a ſpreading and majeſtic oak. It is a gentle rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023176_0207_0FBDDF99E7FCCD18"/>let by the ſide of a foaming torrent, or a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ocean. It is a pretty artificial fire-work, playing in the neighbourhood of a tremendous Aetna.</p>
                     <p>But Voltaire was a <hi>congenial</hi> writer, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial ſoul. In praiſing his <hi>ſuperficial</hi> talents, Cheſterfield did an honour to his own.</p>
                     <p>If this writer had not been a peer, who would have read his letters with ſo much avidity? All he has produced, would, immediately have periſhed with the other <hi>frothy</hi> bubbles of the day. His eternal repetition of "graces, graces," makes one abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſick; and the regimen he preſcribes for the attainment of them, creates him an enemy, in every friend of religion and of virtue.</p>

He is, however, on the whole, a captivating writer; and I would not forbid you the pleaſure of peruſing his intereſting work. You may admire his language, without imbibing his infidelity.

                     <p>I would not, for the richeſt mitre in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, be a Gibbon, in my lateſt moments. In health and proſperity, we may be dazzled with tinſel. But when we come to die, every thing will vaniſh, but piety and truth.</p>

I mean Richardſon. His works, indeed, are not to be examined by the ſtrict laws of a faſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ous criticiſm. They have many <hi>luxuriancies,</hi> and too much <hi>prolixity.</hi> The language is natural and eaſy, but it is not <hi>condenſed</hi> into the elegant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023176_0210_0FBDDF9E65AC2A40"/>and <hi>energy</hi> of the ancients. Richardſon was a ſtranger to the inimitable models of Greece and Rome. He was not a <hi>claſſic;</hi> but he poſſeſſed a moſt extenſive knowledge of human life and manners; his judgment was ſtrong and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; his taſte, accurate; his ſenſibility, exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; his imagination, wonderful; and his heart, impaſſioned. Maſter of the human character, he knew all its <hi>meandrings.</hi> Maſter of the human ſoul, he penetrated into all its foldings and receſſes.</p>
                     <p>With the ſame breath, and in the ſame moment, he melts, he tranſports, he elevates, he dignifies, he convinces, and inſtructs. Pathos is all his own. <q>He opens the hardeſt rocks by the mere force of his narrative, and the waters flow.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Richardſon was, indeed, a writer of no trifling magnitude. He was a genius of no ordinary kind. Degrade this <hi>ethereal</hi> ſpirit, as you will, it will mount up to its kindred ſkies. Call him a <hi>noveliſt,</hi> his merit riſes above names and forms. <hi>Theſe</hi> cannot debaſe his talents. Handle this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as roughly as you pleaſe, it returns, with an elaſtic vigour, to its uſual ſhape, and defies oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>But the excellency of his <hi>intention</hi> is above all praiſe. The intereſts of virtue and religion were near his heart; and he choſe the epiſtolatory plan merely to engage the attention of his readers, and that imagination might lend its livelieſt charms to <hi>animate</hi> his precepts.</p>
                     <p>What a pattern of all virtues and graces is his Grandiſon! What a lovely and finiſhed girl, is his Harriet Byron! What an unruffled piety! What a melting affection! What filial duty to her aged grandmother? What a kind ſympathy
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:023176_0211_0FBDDF9FE53B6710"/>with all her friends! What ſenſibility, yet what prudence! What tenderneſs, yet what diſcretion appear in her character! How nicely is her ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs mixed with vivavity, her fine ſenſe with modeſty, and her frankneſs, with decorum! How fondly does ſhe love, yet how delicately does ſhe manage and regulate the flame!</p>
                     <p>When ſhe pined, in ſecret, with an unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attachment, what cheerfulneſs to all her friends burſt through the heavy gloom, that lowered on her mind! What fear of giving any pain to others, though comfortleſs herſelf! What veneration did ſhe expreſs for the unhappy Clementina! What a generous concern for the innocent, girliſh emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Emily! What an unaffected friendſhip for the lively Lady G —, and when ſhe was really addreſſed by her Grandiſon, with what an open frankneſs, yet what a guarded delicacy and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary confuſion, did ſhe tell him that he had the full poſſeſſion of her ſoul!</p>
                     <p>How venerable and engaging has this writer made the character of a clergyman, in the caſe of Dr. Bartlett! How judiciouſly has he mixed the paſtor, with the friend, and combined the moſt rigid principles, with the ſofteſt and moſt attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive graces. What innocence, integrity, and what prudence and caution about interfering in <hi>family</hi> concerns, has he given, in another work, to Dr. Lewen! What an <hi>independent</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, likewiſe; what a leaning to the ſide of the unfortunate Clariſſa, in oppoſition to all the greateſt of her friends; what a glowing, univerſal benevolence; what a ſerene, and undiſſembled piety! And how ſtrikingly has he contraſted <hi>both</hi> with the cunning hypocriſy and
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:023176_0212_0FBDDFA16B05EA80"/>pedantic affectation of another perſon, who, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, wore, without really <hi>deſerving,</hi> ſo ſacred a ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>In oppoſition to modern cuſtoms, which, under a <hi>falſe</hi> idea of greatneſs, would trample on ſacred ceremonies, and bring the holy ordinances of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to their own <hi>fire-ſides,</hi> in a manner, which diveſts them of all ſolemnity and decorum, what an invincible attachment does his Grandiſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play to all the <hi>decencies</hi> and duties of the church! What a reluctance does he expreſs againſt having his marriage <hi>deſecrated</hi> by a <hi>private</hi> celebration; and how does he oblige his timid and his bluſhing Harriet to vow at the <hi>altar,</hi> in the preſence of God, and in the face of day, her obedience, and her affection! In fact theſe outward <hi>decencies</hi> are the very fences of piety. Break them down, and the ſacred encloſure will ſoon become <q>common and unclean.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>If, in ſhort, I wiſhed a girl to be every thing, that was <hi>great,</hi> I would have her continually ſtudy his Clariſſa. If I was ambitious to make her every thing, that was <hi>lovely,</hi> ſhe ſhould ſpend <hi>her days and nights,</hi> in contemplating his Byron.</p>
                     <p>I muſt, however, confeſs a ſtrong preference for the work of Sir Charles Grandiſon. The read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Clariſſa leaves, upon the mind, too melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly impreſſions. Her diſtreſſes are too deep and too <hi>unvaried</hi> for ſenſibility to bear. She was every thing, that was virtuous, and we look up with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. She was every thing, that was miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we look <hi>down</hi> with deſpair. We are tempted to fancy, that <q>there is no reward for the righteous, nor any God that judgeth the earth.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="unknown:023176_0213_0FBDDFA2E507DFA8"/>
There is a certain point, <hi>beyond</hi> which our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions will not bear to be racked. Beyond it even ſympathy, the lovelieſt of them all, turns into the wildneſs of deſpair. Virtue may have its ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and its trials; but they ſhould not be <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> Hope would ceaſe to bloom, and the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intolerable, if it was wholly compoſed of a dull and dreary winter, without a ſpring. If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did not, generally, interfere in favour of its ſaints, religion, I ſhould ſuſpect, would ſoon loſe one of its ſtrongeſt encouragements, and moſt ſovereign ſupports.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Byron is always lovely, and always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting. Her virtues are more within the reach of mortality. Her afflictions are leſs poignant; and when her long attachment is crowned with ſucceſs, every good mind feels a pleaſure, too big for expreſſion. We are happy for Clariſſa, only when ſhe is <hi>dead.</hi> We are very agreeably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted for Miſs Byron, through every period of her life, and <hi>Lady Grandiſon</hi> charms us into congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating triumph.</p>

But what is all this againſt his writings? Why people, you ſay, are deterred from attempting to imitate ſo exalted a pattern. But that would be a mark of an ignoble ſoul, and of a luke warmneſs in the cauſe of religion and virtue. If we deſpair of attaining to all their <hi>perfections,</hi> is it nothing to <hi>approximate,</hi> as nearly as we can? Is it not a noble and a glorious emulation, at leaſt, to exert our <hi>utmoſt</hi> ſtrength, when we are running the race of immortality?</p>
                     <p>The founder of our holy religion is much more highly raiſed above our imitation, and yet do not the ſcriptures preſs us to make the neceſſary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? Who ever thought this pattern blameable, becauſe ſo <hi>exalted?</hi> Or whoever dreamed of remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his endeavours, becauſe he could not reach the <hi>ſublimity</hi> of its virtues?</p>
                     <p>The one, you will ſay, was real; the other is fictitious; this is human; that was divine.</p>
                     <p>True; but are we not to copy this divinity, in our <hi>degree?</hi> And who can blame fancy for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting us with a <hi>perfect</hi> mirror of goodneſs? If imagination can be uſed to an important purpoſe, this, I think, is the plan; if it can be <hi>ſanctified</hi> to aid the intereſts of piety, this appears the mode of ſanctification. It is only to be blamed, and it then becomes, in all theſe books, a moſt dangerous and unholy principle, when it exhibits ſcenes and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to inflame thoſe paſſions, which ſhould always be, religiouſly, ſuppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I bluſh, on the whole, cautious as I ſhould be, to have borne this humble teſtimony to the merit of the author of Sir Charles Grandiſon, to have offered my unavailing incenſe, at his ſhrine. If I durſt <hi>preach</hi> in ſome ſuch manner, I
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:023176_0215_0FBDDFA5E5B6F7E0"/>could make more converts. The pulpit will never have its full influence and effect, till <hi>argument</hi> is mixed with ſtrong appeals to the <hi>heart;</hi> and till, whilſt the judgment is convinced, the imagination is permitted by lively, deſcriptive and energetic ſallies, to captivate the ſoul.</p>

                     <p>I REJOICE to find you diſguſted with Triſtram Shandy. I never thought theſe writings fit for a lady.</p>
                     <p>Let me candidly aſk our modern fair ones? could they bear to hear ſuch <hi>converſations,</hi> without bluſhing, or expreſſing their contempt? And ſhould not then the eye be as chaſte, as the ear? The firſt, indeed, can be gratified in private. But can that delicacy be very exquiſite, which can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, when alone, on ſentiments and deſcriptions, from which, in <hi>public,</hi> it <hi>affects</hi> to turn away with indignation and abhorrence?</p>
                     <p>I have always, in private lamented, that Sterne was a clergyman. He might be a lively, humor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous companion, but he had too much <hi>levity</hi> for this profeſſion. It is true, he had talents, but what is <hi>ungoverned</hi> genius, but a violent flame, which burns, inſtead of warming, and dazzles, where it ſhould enlighten and direct?</p>
                     <p>This writer has done inexpreſſible miſchief. He has opened wide the flood-gates of indecency, and an overwhelming torrent has poured on the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023176_0216_0FBDDFA765ABA188"/>land. He has conveyed <hi>indelicate</hi> ideas into the minds of young people, under the ſpecious vehicle of ſentiment, and he has dignified <hi>eventual</hi> crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality with the falſe, inſidious title of <hi>involuntary</hi> attachment. The corrupted and unbluſhing fair has gloried in her ſhame. She has appealed for her juſtification, from the <hi>groſſneſs</hi> of paſſion, to ſecret and <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> feelings of the heart.</p>
                     <p>It is a juſt compliment to the preſent age, that the beſt writers preſerve more decorum. An <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicate</hi> alluſion would, now, be eſteemed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable offence againſt the public taſte. Even the <hi>ſtage</hi> is conſiderably reformed. It was far otherwiſe in (what was called) our <hi>Auguſtan</hi> age. Almoſt every author of <hi>that</hi> period (Addiſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,) breathes ſomething of indelicacy. In many paſſages, Swift is intolerable; Pope inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and even Bolingbroke, with all his claims to birth, as well as eloquence, is not without ſome <hi>groſs</hi> ideas, and ſome vulgar expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>But the great corrupter of them all was Swift. The <hi>reſervoir</hi> of filthineſs; all the ſeparate ſtreams might claim him for their parent ſource. I have already given my ſentiments of this author. It is not neceſſary to ſwell the invective, or add any thing to the charges, adduced againſt him. His abilities I never ſuſpected; but I always called in queſtion his temper and his heart.</p>
                     <p>Panegyriſts, however, have enumerated his many virtues. To Ireland, they ſay, he was a ſkilful patriot; to the church, a defender, and to the poor, a friend.</p>
                     <p>For the honour of human nature, I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put a negative on theſe virtues. Let
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023176_0217_0FBDDFA8E61DB890"/>them all be taken into the <hi>general</hi> account. The balance will not ſtill be heavy in his favour.</p>

Sometimes ſhe has been known to ſit down in a liſtleſs lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor, and wholly to abandon the journey in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
                     <p>We are not, in this ſtate, formed for <hi>extremes.</hi> Any of the paſſions, too <hi>violently</hi> exerciſed, would wear out an imperfect frame. True piety is not the blazing <hi>meteor</hi> of an hour, fiery in its aſpect, and engaging the aſtoniſhment of a gazing multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but that ſofter and ſettled light of the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, <q>which ſhineth more and more, unto the perfect day.</q>

                     <p>I AM ſorry to ſay, that you diſplay a <hi>falſe</hi> taſte in admiring Kilkhampton Abbey. I am now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its merits, merely as a <hi>compoſition.</hi> It is not executed with the ſkill of a maſter. The ſame uniform turn of period and of ſentiment, and the ſame laboured <hi>pomp</hi> of words, is viſible through all the different inſcriptions. Surely the epitaphs on ſo many characters, all written as might be
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:023176_0219_0FBDDFABE64299F8"/>ſuppoſed, by <hi>different</hi> hands, ſhould be various and multiform.</p>
                     <p>I never thought epitaph an eaſy ſpecies of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It requires ſuch a nice diſcrimination of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſuch a force of pathos, and ſo conciſe an elegance, as fall not to the lot of one man, in a thouſand. Many have <hi>attempted</hi> this ſtyle of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but, in my opinion, few have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>I do, indeed, moſt cordially deteſt this <hi>anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> abuſe. It is contrary to all my ideas of civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization, politeneſs, fortitude, and even common gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity, and militates againſt every thing, that ſhould conſtitute the real character of a gentleman, or a chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>No man lives, without <hi>foibles</hi> or <hi>particularities;</hi> and, if inſtead of making allowance for thoſe of others, in order to receive an indulgence for our own, we ungenerouſly expoſe them to ridicule or contempt, the conſequence, in ſociety, muſt be a general coldneſs, diſguſt, rancour, hoſtility, and <hi>unceaſing</hi> perſecution.</p>
                     <p>No perſon can be ſo circumſpect, particularly, in a public character, as to avoid creating, though without intending it, a number of little piques and enemies againſt himſelf; ſometimes even by an inflexible diſcharge of <hi>neceſſary</hi> duties; and if his character muſt be taken from the colourings of thoſe, whom he has thus innocently, perhaps <hi>laudably,</hi> offended, all his virtues will be thrown into the back ground, and his foibles aggravated with the utmoſt virulence of malice and reſentment. Prejudice <hi>againſt,</hi> may render the moſt amiable perſon <hi>ridiculous,</hi> by concealing the <hi>great,</hi> and bringing forward the little; and prejudice <hi>for,</hi> may give ſome ſort of merit to the moſt deſpicable and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023176_0220_0FBDDFAD684BCBC0"/>abandoned. Such a liberty of the preſs is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>licentiouſneſs;</hi> and every friend to order and virtue, if he will conſult his own feelings, will not heſitate to pronounce, that, of all <hi>ſacred</hi> things, character is <hi>moſt</hi> ſo.</p>
                     <p>If a perſon, however great, had uſed me <hi>ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,</hi> I would certainly expoſe him to public cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and drag him before the formidable tribunal of my country. I would appeal from the oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of any <hi>individual,</hi> to the <hi>general</hi> equity and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of mankind. <hi>This,</hi> I ſhould conceive, not merely an act of juſtice to <hi>myſelf,</hi> but likewiſe to the world. It is a <hi>common</hi> intereſt, that <hi>tyrants,</hi> however high in rank, or in ſelf-eſtimation, ſhould meet with their deſerved infamy and contempt.— Such a diſplay of <hi>true</hi> ſpirit wonderfully ſtops the progreſs of deſpotiſm, and teaches inſolence the hard leſſon of moderation. But, then, it ſhould be done in the moſt open manner. I would can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly ſubſcribe my name to the charges, I adduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, whilſt I ſhewed the world that I feared not the perſon of man, I would convince mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, that I was far above the meanneſs of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>unmanly</hi> or ungenerous revenge.</p>
                     <p>This honeſt courage was poſſeſſed, in an eminent degree, by the late Dr. Johnſon. Nothing has pleaſed me more in the hiſtory of his life, than his troly magnanimous conduct to the late earl of Cheſterfield. When he undertook to compoſe his <hi>elaborate</hi> dictionary, he ſolicited the favour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing it to his Lordſhip, who was then if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not Secretary of State. Flattered with <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the patron of literature, Cheſterfield accepted the honour of the dedication, and an <hi>honour</hi> it would have been to any nobleman in the world.—
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023176_0221_0FBDDFAEE6B4E3C8"/>In the progreſs of this long and tedious work, he received no very ſolid marks of encouragement from his patron, and ſuſpected on the whole, that the courtly peer meant only to <hi>amuſe</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>Johnſon had too much ſpirit either to brook the idea of neglect, the chicanery of a miniſter, the violation of a promiſe, or the ſervility of an abject dependence. He was not likely to be daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled with the glitter of a coronet, or intimidated with the ceremonious pageantry of office. He, therefore, wrote a formal letter to the nobleman, upbraiding him with inſincerity, diſclaiming his protection, and aſſuring him, that he did not want, and never would receive, any of his favours.— The conſequence of this <hi>fracas</hi> was, that he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſtung Cheſterfield with ſuch bitter invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and ſo many pointed ſtrokes of raillery and ſatire, as made him heartily repent of having rouſed his reſentment, and deſirous, at any rate, of a reconciliation. Johnſon, however, perſiſted in his antipathy, and never afterwards, I believe wrote a dedication.</p>
                     <p>If Cheſterfield intended only to dally with the author of this dictionary, he ſhould certainly have conſidered, that men of great abilities have too much penetration not to ſee through any flimſy diſguiſes of a miniſter; too much irritability not to be exaſperated with hypocriſy or artifice, and too <hi>lofty</hi> a reliance on their own <hi>native</hi> powers to be afraid of any peer or monarch in the world.</p>
                     <p>Johnſon, it is true, had not then attained all his eminence and diſtinction. He was comparatively, but <hi>riſing</hi> into notice. The day that ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him the hero of literature, was only in its dawn. But contraſted with his <hi>ſolid</hi> merit, what
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023176_0222_0FBDDFB06882DD68"/>is the paltry tinſel of ſtation, from which ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple immediately become ſo ſupercilious and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding?</p>
                     <p>If Cheſterfield did not think the author of the Rambler, greater than himſelf; if from the foot alone, he could not prognoſticate the future ſtrength and immenſe proportions of this literary <hi>Hercules,</hi> he had not a ſingle grain of that ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or diſcernment for which he has been ſo much complimented by the world.</p>
                     <p>Such is <hi>my</hi> idea of the true and genuine ſpirit, which ſhould characterize a ſcholar and a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. It is not a ſtiletto, ſtabbing in the dark, but a challenge to a fair and generous onſet, in which your antagoniſt has the opportunity of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and of managing all his weapons to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>

                     <p>THE beauty of the lady you allude to, was her misfortune. It inſpired her with an immoderate vanity, and that vanity paved the way to her ruin. It dug the grave, in which her peace and character are now intombed.</p>
                     <p>And after all, my dear girl, what <hi>is</hi> this beauty? It is a little clay, caſt in an elegant mould, and by the hand of an exquiſite artiſt, faſhioned into ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſymmetry and order. It is a ſmall mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the cheek of roſes and carnations.</p>
                     <p>But who needs to be informed that clay is very periſhable, that roſes and carnations are but for <hi>ſummer moments,</hi> and that afterwards there comes a
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:023176_0223_0FBDDFB1E68ED1B0"/>long autumn of ſickneſs, or a ſtill more dreaty winter of infirmity and old age.</p>
                     <p>How tranſient are the power and duration of beauty! How very ſlight an accident or diſeaſe blaſts it for ever! How fatal is a fever, the ſmall pox, or a little corroding grief to all its allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! and if they do not periſh ſooner, how dreadfully are they ravaged by the hand of time!</p>
                     <p>Whilſt ſummer laſts, a few, fluttering inſects light upon its lips, to ſip the ſweets. Some ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling birds of paſſage chirp upon the neighbouring ſpray, delighted with a view of the amiable object. The notice is enchanting, and imagination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that it ſhall be <hi>ternal.</hi> But the firſt ſtorm, that comes, alas! theſe feathered ſongſters migrate to warmer climates, and a ſerener ſky, leaving all its withered charms to periſh in neglect!</p>
                     <p>How ridiculous is the girl, who wilfully ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the poiſon of flattery for any perſonal charms, and, in the height of her intoxication, can be inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or conceited! What woman of ſpirit ſhould not aſpire to qualities, that are leſs <hi>accidental</hi> and leſs ſubject to change! What woman of reflexion ſhould not reſolve to adorn and cultivate a mind, whoſe treaſures may be inexhauſtible, and whoſe attractions never die?</p>
                     <p>I pity every girl, whom nature has gifted with a very pretty face. She ſeems, by the very act, to have marked her out for trials and temptations, and our ſtrength is not always in proportion to our conflicts.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the unfortunate ladies, I have known, have been celebrated for their beauty. This has gathered all the worthleſs of our ſex about them;

                     <p>Beautiful women, fluſhed with conqueſt, often neglect the <hi>neceſſary</hi> cultivation of their heart and underſtanding: and, if every man would examine himſelf ſeriouſly, and was required to give in a liſt of the females he <hi>moſt</hi> reſpects, the prettieſt, I believe, would not <hi>generally,</hi> be in the number.</p>

                     <p>Addiſon has ſeveral in his ſpectators, which are wrought up with inimitable beauty.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Antiope</hi> of Cambray, is a charming picture, but it betrays the touches of a popiſh eccleſiaſtic.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Law's Miranda</hi> is an heroine of virtue, but ſhe breathes too much the auſterity and the abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that very animated, but peculiar writer. Her piety is too monaſtic. It wants grace, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and eaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Richardſon's Clariſſa</hi> has qualities <hi>above</hi> woman, and her ſorrows plunge the reader into deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Byron is every thing, that is finiſhed in a female. We admire her greatly, but we love her more. The <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of the character ſwallows up its dignity; in the amiable, we forget the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:023176_0225_0FBDDFB4E78FE248"/>great. She is preciſely what every man of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and taſte would have a woman <hi>to</hi> be, when he wiſhes to be married, and wiſhes to be happy.</p>
                     <p>With <hi>ſome</hi> perſons, his <hi>Clementina</hi> may have her ſuperior excellencies.

                     <p>POOR Louiſa, notwithſtanding all her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is, at preſent, in the greateſt affliction, and for a reaſon, which reflects no little honour on her ſenſibility and virtue.</p>
                     <p>I have juſt received a letter from her father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me, that Dr. —, Rector of B—, and the confidential friend and intimate of their family, is very probable on his death bed. He
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:023176_0226_0FBDDFB665C53850"/>was lately called upon, it ſeems, to viſit one of his hearers, who was ſick with a putrid, ſore throat, and fever, and has taken the infection. The phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians entertain but ſlender hopes of his recovery, and Philander<note n="*" place="bottom">The father of Louiſa.</note> has been adminiſtering to him that holy ſacrament, which with prayers and bleſſings, he has himſelf ſo often, adminiſtered to others.— The whole village is in mourning. All the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, I am told, appear as ſheep without a ſhepherd.</p>
                     <p>This good man was well acquainted with every perſon in his pariſh. He thought it his duty, to viſit all his hearers, to inveſtigate their <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as well as temporal wants, and to remove the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer whilſt he extended a liberal ſupply to the latter.</p>
                     <p>The death of ſuch a perſon is more than the loſs of the neareſt relatives. A <hi>good</hi> clergyman, in the <hi>country,</hi> unites, in his own perſon, all the tender connections. He is father, brother, guardian, all in one. Dr. — was not only revered as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but in every family welcomed as a boſom friend.</p>
                     <p>A religious paſtor, indeed, never fully knows the comforts of his office, till he is thus united to his people, <q>till he knows his ſheep and they follow him.</q> In ſuch an intimacy, hearts expand; many excellent and ſeaſonable advices may be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en which the ſolemnity of the pulpit would not admit; little griefs are unboſomed; little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities are removed, and affection ſprings up by the ſide of duty.</p>
                     <p>I am going to make a viſit to this worthy cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, and will give you the earlieſt intelligence of the ſtate in which find him.</p>

                     <p>THE apprehenſions concerning Dr — were but too well founded. He is, I do believe, in the laſt ſtages of his life. Death is on the point of eloſing his eyes, and opening for him the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all his labours and his zeal.</p>
                     <p>I have been with him almoſt night and day, ever ſince I had the pleaſure of writing to you, and have received a ſtronger leſſon, than ever, of the vanity of all earthly things, and the ſupreme dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of virtue.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſolemn ſcenes wonderfully improve the heart. They ſtrip ambition of its plumage. The world appears a phantom! honours and promotions all a dream!</p>
                     <p>Though I have been much affected, yet I have been comforted in an equal degree, by his cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piety, and edifying converſation. His faith and reſignation riſe ſuperior to his pains. They are literally big with immortality; and he longs to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Unwearied and exemplary as he has <hi>always</hi> been in the diſcharge of his paſtoral duties he is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually lamenting his want of zeal, vigilance and exertion. The duties of the miniſtry are, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, beyond human ability: <q>who, ſaid St. Paul, is ſufficient for theſe things?</q> But when I hear the declarations of this excellent man, and compare, as it is natural, his example with my own, I cannot but be ſeriouſly alarmed, and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023176_0228_0FBDDFB964CE5530"/>ſketch out nothing for <hi>my own</hi> laſt moments, but remorſe and fears.</p>
                     <p>My good friend and his lady have taken their laſt leave. It would have touched <hi>any</hi> heart to have ſeen this interview. I cannot do it juſtice by <hi>words.</hi> The pencil of a Raphael could not fully repreſent it. It was all <hi>heart</hi> and ſoul. Silent looks and <hi>manner</hi> were the principal language, and they ſpoke indeed! Such a woman's breaſt pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with grief, upon ſuch an occaſion, riſes above the powers of deſcription.</p>
                     <p>"O (ſays the expiring chriſtian, raiſing his languid eyes and endeavouring to uſe a tongue, which death had almoſt palſied,) <q>be as you <hi>have</hi> been, the comforters of my people (for they alas! will feel a <hi>tranſient</hi> void,) and our friendſhip, I doubt not, will ſhortly be renewed in another life.

                     <p>Louiſa is inconſolable. "Tears have been her meat day and night;" and her grief is the heavier, as ſhe is not permitted, from motives of <hi>prudence,</hi> to ſee the laſt ſtruggles of this excellent man, or receive his bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Providence, (ſays the accompliſhed girl,) has <hi>now,</hi> but, <hi>one</hi> heavier ſtroke to inflict, and that is the death of my father, or my mother. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>ſecond</hi> father he has always been to me, in the fulleſt ſenſe of the word. What has not this good man done, what has he not ever ſaid to train my youthful ſentiments to virtue, and direct my ſteps into the way of peace? To <hi>him</hi> I could diſcloſe every riſing fear. To him I could unboſom the anxious ſorrow, that would
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:023176_0229_0FBDDFBAE66354E0"/>have lurked at my heart. But why ſhould I complain? Have I not ſtill a <hi>thouſand</hi> comforts, ſpread round my retirement? Have I not <hi>yet</hi> two parents left, accompliſhed, as they are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and watchful, as they are good? It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to grieve. I will dry theſe tears. It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good. The good Abraham was required to ſacrifice on the altar, with his <hi>own</hi> hands, an only ſon.

                     <p>From the natural tenderneſs and ſenſibility of his temper you may wonder that he lived and died unmarried.

                     <p>Though remarkable for his prudence, as well as paſtoral zeal, yet having but a few, diſtant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who were all in very eaſy circumſtances, he has only left to each, an equal legacy of £100 and the remainder of the £5000, he poſſeſſed, is entirely devoted to charitable uſes.</p>
                     <p>To each of his three ſervants, he has bequeathed an annual ſtipend of £20, on this eaſy condition, however, that they be never abſent, when in <hi>health,</hi> from the church or ſacrament; that they always appear neat and decent, and that they lay up, from their pittance, one ſingle ſix pence on the firſt day of every week, to be expended in <hi>charity.</hi> The reſidue of his fortune is to be employed, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in eſtabliſing a fund for the diſtribution of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious books and tracts, amongſt the poor and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his pariſh, at the diſcretion of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter; and, partly, for the clothing and educating a ſpecific number of boys and girls in a ſchool, which he had founded, and very principally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in his life-time.</p>
                     <p>My friend and I are joint executors. To him he has demiſed a conſiderable part of his excellent library; to me a number of books, which are at once a monument of his taſte and friendſhip; to Mrs.—, all the elegant furniture of his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing room, and to his ſweet, and, as he ſtyles her, ever dear Louiſa, his pictures, ſtatues, buſts and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>When the poor girl was informed of this legacy, ſhe burſt into a flood of tears, nor could all the tender offices of her friends conſole her. <q>How inſupportable (ſaid ſhe,) is this man's genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity! with what a cruel kindneſs does he haunt me after death! Had it not been for this perhaps, I ſhould more eaſily have learned the <hi>hard</hi> leſſon of reſignation. But this tenderneſs renews my grief, and tears open afreſh the wounds, which I have been ſummoning all my fortitude to cloſe. But why muſt I not ſee this good man on his death-bed, to teſtify, for the laſt time, the warmth of my gratitude, and the ſincerity of my eſteem?</q>

                     <p>I REJOICE to hear that you have ſo great a taſte for paintings. You will find it an inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſource of pleaſure and improvement. For,
<q>
                           <l>"Each pleaſing art lends ſoftneſs to our minds,</l>
                           <l>"And with our ſtudies, are our lives refin'd."</l>
                        </q>
I will give you a very handſome eulogy on this art, in the words of a great writer, Quintilian. <q>Picture (ſays he,) a ſilent and uniform addreſs, yet penetrates ſo deeply into our inmoſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it ſeems often to exceed even the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of eloquence. Its effects, indeed, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times amazing. It is ſaid, that Alexander trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and grew pale, on ſeeing a picture of Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes, betrayed to death by his friends; it bringing to his mind a ſtinging remembrance of his treatment of Ariſtonicus. Portia could bear, with an unſhaken conſtancy, her laſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Brutus; but when ſhe ſaw, ſome hours after a picture of the parting of Hector and Andromache, ſhe burſt into a flood of tears. Full as ſeemed her ſorrow, the painter ſuggeſted new ideas of grief, or impreſſed more ſtrongly her <hi>own.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your queſtion concerning the ſuperiority of the ancients or moderns in this particular, is very eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered. In moſt, if not <hi>all</hi> the fine arts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the former, according to my apprehenſion, are abſolutely unrivalled. By the ancients, I <hi>now</hi> mean, particularly the Greeks.</p>
                     <p>Whether it was owing to the particular nature and freedom of their government—to the ſuperior honours 
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023176_0233_0FBDDFC0E73AEC48"/>and encouragement that were laviſhed on genius and the arts in this more early period of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety—whether to any particular ſuperiority of organization in the natives of this country—whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to its beautiful ſcenery or the allegorical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a religion, which ſo much called painting, poetry and ſculpture into exerciſe—or whether we may not aſcribe it to an happy <hi>combination</hi> of all theſe ſeparate cauſes, it is certain, that their taſte and imaginaton were exquiſite beyond thoſe of any other people, and produced a degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in their artiſts, that we cannot find in any other age or country of the world.</p>
                     <p>Raphael, whom all Europe has ſo much praiſed, excelled only, as he formed himſelf upon the model of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Italians (obſerves an able judge,) may excel in colouring; but compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, drawing, the art of grouping, attitude, movement, expreſſion, contraſt, drapery, charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and grace—all theſe, this great genius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly borrowed from the ancient ſtatues and bas reliefs.</p>
                     <p>Palladio is the firſt of architects, Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo, Fiammingo, Algardi, the moſt celebrated ſculptors, only for the ſame reaſon; they ſtudied the Greeks. Yet Angelo was the boldeſt genius, that Italy ever had. "It was he, who conceived the idea of placing the pantheon in the air, and conſtructed the dome of St. Peter's on the ſame dimenſions."</p>
                     <p>Nor in <hi>letters</hi> were the Greeks leſs the model of perfection. To emulate their beſt writers has been the ambition of every ſucceeding age. And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence has been attained only in proportion to the ſucceſsfulneſs of this imitation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:023176_0234_0FBDDFC26B01CFB8"/>
The firſt and moſt complete <hi>poem</hi> in the world, is Grecian—the Iliad of Homer. It unites all the ſeparate aſtoniſhing excellencies of this moſt difficult ſpecies of compoſition; the majeſtic, the terrible, the pathetic and the ſublime. Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, philoſophers, painters, poets, orators, metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have all, in various methods, dug from this mine, and ſtill left it full of inexhauſtible treaſures. It is proverbially known how much the great Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man orator ſtudied Homer, and indeed how much he has been praiſed by the whole world. I will give you a few teſtimonies in his favour.</p>
                     <p>The firſt critic, that ever exiſted, is Longinus, who wrote a treatiſe on the ſublime: This is <hi>his</hi> opinion of the Iliad:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Thoſe only, who have ſublime and ſolid thoughts, can make elevated diſcourſes and, in this part, Homer chiefly excels, whoſe thoughts are all ſublime, as may be ſeen in the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the goddeſs, Diſcord, who has, ſays he, her head in the ſkies, and her feet upon the earth; for it may be ſaid, that that grandeur which he gives her, is leſs the meaſure of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, than of the capacity and elevation of Homer's genius.</q>

                        <hi>Treatiſe on the Sublime.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                     <p>Again in another place: <q>To Homer, that is, to him, who had received the applauſes of the whole world.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, in a third paſſage, mentioning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, who had endeavoured to imitate Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he obſerves:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Plato, however, is he, who has imitated him moſt, for he has drawn from this poet, as
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:023176_0235_0FBDDFC3E62D3D38"/>from a living ſpring, from which he has turned an infinite number of rivulets.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another excellent judge is Horace who bears to this prince of poets, this honourable teſtimony, that he taught <hi>philoſophy</hi> better than many, who were philoſophers by <hi>profeſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A third critic of no inconſiderable talents has theſe lines in his favour:</p>

                     <p>THE Italians excel in ſome of the fine arts. In <hi>muſic,</hi> perhaps, they may juſtly claim a deciſive ſuperiority. Of <hi>colouring</hi> they are great maſters. Amongſt many other diſtinguiſhed painters, they boaſt a Corregio. No one could do more honour
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023176_0237_0FBDDFC6E4B994B0"/>to any nation. He is the very pupil of nature, and has wonderfully united elegance and eaſe. If Raphael ſhines in the <hi>majeſtic,</hi> he has all the <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> graces.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>landſcape</hi> painting, Italy is unrivalled. Thoſe of Claude Lorrain are ſuperior to any other maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's. Perhaps one reaſon is, the beauty of the ſcenes, from which they are taken. Viewed col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, there is not, I ſhould conceive, a more delightful and enchanting country. It ſeems to mingle all the ſoft and milder beauties of climate, with the magnificent and tremendous; gentle hills, rich vallies, fruitful extenſive vineyards, with craggy, rugged precipices, with the portentous aſpect and caverns of Aetna; the bay of Naples, with the formidable grandeur and thunder of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvio.</p>
                     <p>No place has been the ſcene of ſo many memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable events, or given birth to ſuch a number of diſtinguiſhed men. Tuſcany produced Dante, Petrarch, and Michael Angelo; Livy was born at Padua; Titian at Venice, and Arioſto at Ferrara. Urbino is juſtly proud of Raphael, and Parma of Corregio. Rome claims Tacitus and Lucretius, Arpinum, Cicero, and Venuſium, Horace.</p>
                     <p>If my leiſure and opportunities had been equal to my wiſhes, I ſhould have gloried in traverſing this country. Every ſtep would have had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar intereſt, and every ſcene revived thoſe glowing deſcriptions of a Virgil or an Horace, that faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated my <hi>earlieſt</hi> years. When a perſon has been ſome time, in the world, whatever recalls the <hi>firſt</hi> days of life, adminiſters the ſweeteſt pleaſure. It is the picture of innocence and tranquility, whilſt our maturer age is often a buſtle or a ſtorm.</p>

                        <pb n="87" facs="unknown:023176_0238_0FBDDFC8685BDD08"/>
In ancient Rome, it was a confeſſed maxim, that true politeneſs and taſte were derived from the Grecians. And the Italian artiſts ſcill owe much of their excellence to theſe primitive maſters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>literary</hi> taſte of the Italians is very excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable. It is a falſe ſublime, a fictitious glitter, and a barren abundance, and has loſt the true Attic ſalt of nature, of truth and ſimplicity. Hence they are ſaid to prefer the Gothic works of Dante, the abſurdities of Arioſto, the extravagancies of Marini, and the tinſel puerilities of Taſſo, to the tender and impaſſioned deſcriptions of Metaſtaſio.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> ſeem to think themſelves excluſive proprietors of every thing, that goes under the denomination of taſte. And, indeed, they are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally eſteemed a poliſhed, eaſy, graceful and ſeducing people. Few of their writers, however, have much of the <hi>profound,</hi> or that bids fair for <hi>duration.</hi> Of <hi>all</hi> people, they ſeem <hi>leaſt</hi> to have ſtudied the claſſics. Their ſtile, in general, wants energy and compactneſs. In <hi>many</hi> words they communicate but <hi>few</hi> ideas, and their imagination is permitted to run <hi>wild</hi> without hearkening to the ſober dictates of judgment. Though trees in bloſſom are a beautiful object, yet the ſolid <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> lies in their <hi>fruit.</hi> I could except many great names from this, <hi>apparently,</hi> inviduous cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. One, particularly, I will mention—that is Monteſquieu. This man will do them honour with all other nations, and the moſt diſtant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. His <hi>Eſprit de Loix</hi> is, indeed, a moſt aſtoniſhing performance. It unites the depth, the phlegm and patience of ſome other countries, with the vivacity of that, in which it ſprung.</p>

I do not think that England is, by any means, either from climate, or other foſtering circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the <hi>natural</hi> ſoil of the <hi>fine arts.</hi> The hot bed of riches it is true, has raiſed a few <hi>exotics,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> way to a ſuperior <hi>flavour;</hi> and public encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement called forth many virtuoſos from other countries. But in fact, we are too much engaged with trade and politics to cultivate, in any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary degree, the <hi>finer</hi> emotions. Commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial habits, manufactures, and the love of money, wherever they prevail, will always be the grave of <hi>virtù</hi> and of taſte. In point of <hi>polite</hi> learning this kingdom has, long ſince, according to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, been at its zenith. The ſun of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtan age appears to be ſet. But for <hi>profound</hi> knowledge and genius, no nation, perhaps in the known world <hi>has</hi> been more diſtinguiſhed.— Shakeſpeare, Milton, Locke, Sir Iſaac Newton! what other country can produce ſuch a group?— Nor ſhall we want models of the moſt graceful in <hi>writing,</hi> whilſt we can read the works of Addiſon, many papers in the World, the Letters of Lady Wortley Montague, or thoſe of Cheſterfield.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to deny, but that <hi>general ſcience</hi> is more cultivated among the moderns, than it ever was by the ancients, and, in the <hi>preſent</hi> age, more than at any former period whatever. Nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural philoſophy in all its branches, chemiſtry, mathematics, hiſtory, politics, juriſprudence, and the mechanical arts have arrived to a wonderful degree of perfection, and are daily receiving freſh acceſſions of improvement. But I muſt ſtill aſſert, that polite learning ſeems to have flouriſhed moſt in the days of Swift, Pope and Addiſon. What can be the reaſon? Is it that being <hi>then</hi> more new,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:023176_0240_0FBDDFCB67885898"/>as having but juſt emerged from the darkneſs of the times, it was treated with that ſuperior reſpect and deference, we extend to a ſtranger? Is there a greater <hi>dearth</hi> of real genius? <hi>That</hi> we cannot ſuppoſe, if we give ourſelves only leiſure to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the many exalted characters, which Britain boaſts. The caſe, I think, is clear, that a moſt extended commerce has debaſed our feelings and vitiated our taſte; that the grand, <hi>political</hi> intereſts of the nation, as it is <hi>now</hi> circumſtanced, require a moſt unremitting attention; that the high road to honours and emoluments chiefly lying through the bar or ſenate, the greateſt talents in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are turned into theſe channels.

                     <p>YOUR knowledge of the Italian language is much ſuperior to my own. The little that I <hi>have,</hi> was acquired merely to read a few productions of their beſt authors, and be able to form ſome <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative</hi> idea of their merits or defects.</p>
                     <p>I am far from denying to this people the praiſe of great genius. But I ſhould ſuppoſe, that it is not properly cultivated, and the reaſon, perhaps, may be, that, in <hi>modern</hi> Italy, learning meets but with little encouragement.</p>
                     <p>The bad taſte of the Italians in <hi>poetry,</hi> is obvious from many inſtances. Dante, in <hi>their</hi> eſtimation, is ſuperior to <hi>all</hi> men; and Arioſto, whom they conſider as much beneath him, they exalt far above Homer himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Dante had, doubtleſs, wonderful abilities. He riſes in many inſtances, to the ſublime; and, for the times, in which he lived, may juſtly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a literary <hi>prodigy.</hi> But his work, on the whole, is but a <hi>gothic</hi> maſs of various kinds of knowledge ſtrangely heaped together without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, deſign, or perſpicuity.

                        <hi>him</hi> with the author of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> is to betray a total want of all the principles of enlightened criticiſm.</p>
                     <p>Arioſto ſhines in narrative. He tells a ſtory with gracefulneſs and eaſe. Some of his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are particularly ſplendid; and his Orlando Furioſo is a lively, and wonderfully various pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. But how frequently does he fall into ridiculous abſurdities, where he entirely loſes ſight of nature and of truth, forgetting that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rule of a judicious critic:</p>

                     <p>I HAVE now finiſhed my recommendation of authors. I am apprehenſive, indeed, of having mentioned too many. But from the whole you can <hi>ſelect</hi> the few, you like, or which it is moſt convenient for you to purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>Some of theſe books, particularly thoſe, which treat on religious ſubjects may not entertain you ſo much at preſent, as they will at ſome future period, when your taſte and judgment are more effectually ripened; but I did not know whether <hi>then</hi> I might have the opportunity of writing to you or whether I ſhould even be in the world; and I wiſhed to give you ſomething of a <hi>ſyſtematic</hi> plan, that might be conſulted through every ſtage of your life.</p>
                     <p>The criticiſms upon books, characters, &amp;c. have not been introduced from a faſtidious ſpirit, or with a view of diſplaying learning and talents, but to exerciſe and improve <hi>your diſcriminating</hi> facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and enliven the, <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> dull uniformity of didactic letters. I have only preſumed to give my opinion; and to <hi>this,</hi> in a land of liberty, and in an enlightened age, I conceive myſelf to have an equal right with the firſt ſcholar, or critic of the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Louiſa,</hi> you well know, is not a <hi>fictitious,</hi> but a <hi>real</hi> character; and, though my partiality may

I conſidered this mode, as likely to communicate ſome little <hi>intereſt</hi> and variety to my letters; and <hi>that</hi> appeared to me a motive, which, with <hi>all</hi> young people, ſhould be conſulted.</p>
                     <p>On the whole, conſider me not as <hi>dogmatizing,</hi> but only as communicating to you, with great freedom and ſincerity, the beſt ſentiments, I can; thoſe, which convince your underſtanding, receive with candour; the reſt reject, and do not fancy me ſo conceited; as even for a moment, to have perſuaded myſelf that from <hi>my</hi> tribunal, there lies no appeal.</p>

                     <p>IF I was called upon to write the hiſtory of a <hi>woman</hi>'s trials and ſorrows, I would date it from the moment when nature has pronounced her <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riageble,</hi> and ſhe feels that innocent deſire of aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating with the other ſex, which needs not a bluſh. If I had a girl of my own, at this <hi>critical</hi> age, I ſhould be full of the keeneſt apprehenſions for her ſafety; and, like the great poet, when the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was bent on ſeducing our firſt parents from their innocence and happineſs, I ſhould invoke the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance

                        <hi>Men</hi> are often too much engroſſed with buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ambition, or criminal purſuits to think very ſeriouſly of this connection; but if they happen to remain <hi>ſingle,</hi> their very efforts become their amuſement, and keep them from experiencing that <hi>unquiet</hi> indolence, which, by <hi>enervating</hi> the mind, powerfully awakens imagination and the ſenſes. A <hi>woman</hi> has abundant leiſure to brood over her inquietude, and to nurſe the vapours, till they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in diſeaſe.

                     <p>It ſhould not, however, be diſſembled, (for it ariſes from natural principles,) that <hi>married</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are generally more pleaſing, than ſuch, as never formed this connection.

                     <p>A married woman, likewiſe, has baniſhed that ſhy reſerve, which <hi>young</hi> ladies <hi>think</hi> themſelves, and, indeed, in ſome degree, <hi>are</hi> obliged to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, but which, neceſſary as it may be, conceals many of their lovelieſt graces.

This is the method to make them ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and put them on avoiding your ſociety for ever. You may eaſily be civil, and yet convince them by your looks and manner, that you perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand how to appreciate <hi>indiſcriminate</hi> complaiſance.</p>
                     <p>Though, by no means, <hi>ſeriouſly</hi> bent upon <hi>matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> yet not a few of them, will pay you flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attentions. <hi>Theſe,</hi> if you be not cautions, may, very inſenſibly, ſoften your heart, and enſnare your affections, particularly if they come from men, whoſe <hi>general</hi> character or manners you eſteem. One caution, therefore, permit me to give you, with an <hi>aſſurance</hi> that it muſt be <hi>religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> obſerved, as you value either your dignity or repoſe—never to believe any man in <hi>earneſt,</hi> till he makes the moſt <hi>pointed</hi> declarations in your favour.</p>

                        <hi>Faſhion</hi> has made it ſo much a matter of <hi>form</hi> to pay attentions to a woman, and, particularly, if ſhe is ſmart, witty, beautiful; if ſhe is celebrated for high connections, or accompliſhments, or makes a good figure in public, that numbers of men will be <hi>mechanically</hi> led to flutter about you, who, <hi>In fact,</hi> mean only to <hi>amuſe</hi> the moment,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:023176_0251_0FBDDFDBE9C3BDF0"/>or do honour to their own good breeding and politeneſs.</p>
                     <p>Believe me, my dear girl, this gay and <hi>lively</hi> ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will <hi>ſoon</hi> be at an <hi>end.</hi> Girls, that dwell on every body's tongue, and ſport away, in all their gaudy colours, during <hi>ſummer</hi> months, like butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, are never heard of in the <hi>winter,</hi> but ſink into a <hi>torpid</hi> ſtate. They do not, however, reſemble ſome inſects in the very happy, and enviable, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of riſing with <hi>renewed</hi> charms. <hi>Once</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, they ſeldom revive, but are <hi>diſplaced</hi> by <hi>other,</hi> riſing favourites for ever; and it has often been obſerved, that <hi>thoſe</hi> women are moſt rarely thought of for wives, with whom we are the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of (what is called,) flirting, and of ſaying a thouſand, civil things, without meaning or <hi>deſign.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With men of principle and integrity, you are always ſecure. They will religiouſly beware of engaging your affections, without honourable views. But <hi>theſe</hi> alas! where <hi>women</hi> are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are not ſo numerous, as might be expected. More breaches of fidelity are obſervable in this intercourſe, than in any other inſtance of the moſt trifling importance.</p>
                     <p>To entertain a <hi>ſecret</hi> partiality for a man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it <hi>reciprocal,</hi> is dreadful indeed. If you have addreſs and fortitude enough not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it, and thus expoſe yourſelf to ridicule and cenſure, (and yet what prudence is <hi>always</hi> equal to the taſk?) it will coſt you infinite grief, anxiety and vexation; and a victory over yourſelf, if you <hi>do</hi> gain it, may be at the expence of your health and conſtitution. It will, at the ſame time, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unfit you for <hi>any other</hi> connection; for who
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:023176_0252_0FBDDFDD6A0F97E8"/>would take the <hi>body,</hi> when another perſon is in poſſeſſion of the <hi>ſoul?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any man, therefore, can <hi>deliberately</hi> be ſo cruel, as to viſit you frequently, and ſhew you every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity,</hi> that is only ſhort of this <hi>grand</hi> explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never ſee him in private; and, if that be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, and you <hi>ſtill</hi> feel tender ſentiments to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, determine to ſhun his company for ever. It is eaſier, remember, to extinguiſh a fire, that has but <hi>juſt</hi> broken out, than one, which has been gathering ſtrength and <hi>violence,</hi> from a long <hi>concealment.</hi> Many have neglected this neceſſary precaution, and died ſilent <hi>martyrs</hi> to their fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and imprudence. The eye of beauty has <hi>languiſhed</hi> in ſolitude, or been dimmed with a flood of <hi>irremediable</hi> tears. The heart has throbbed with <hi>unconquerable</hi> tumults, which, <hi>gradually</hi> have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved an <hi>elegant</hi> frame, that deſerved a much <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> fate. Undiſcovered by the phyſician, they have baffled all the reſources of his ſkill; they have rendered ineffectual all the tenderneſs of friends, and <hi>death</hi> alone has adminiſtered that eaſe, which neither beauty, friends, not fortune could beſtow.</p>
                     <p>It is poſſible, that men may not <hi>always</hi> act from <hi>unamiable</hi> motives, when they carry their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a conſiderable height, without an <hi>explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Their taſte may have privately ſingled you out from all the reſt of the world, whilſt Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has not propitiouſly raiſed them to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which they conceive to be worth your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. They may have a delicacy, a dignity, and independence of mind, which would not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brook a <hi>repulſe,</hi> or an <hi>inferior</hi> ſituation; and they may be, <hi>very honourably,</hi> probing by theſe, little methods, the ſtate of your inclinations.</p>

Of <hi>theſe</hi> circumſtances you muſt endeavour to judge for yourſelf, or get ſome diſcerning, <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> and more <hi>experienced</hi> friend to be your adviſer. If you ſuſpect a perſon's conduct to ariſe from <hi>ſuch</hi> motives, you cannot treat him with too much attention. He has paid you, in the moſt delicate and flattering manner, the higheſt compliment in the world; and you may depend on his affection being more <hi>ſincere,</hi> in proportion as it is leſs aſſuming, confident, or <hi>obtruſive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you <hi>have</hi> any regard for ſuch a character, his penetration will have diſcovered it. Uſe no <hi>affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> to him. He will ſee through all its flimſy diſguiſes. Attempt no <hi>prudery;</hi> he will behold your boſom panting through the thin, <hi>ſlight</hi> veil, and the hypocriſy will diſguſt. Talk not of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> or <hi>circumſtances; they</hi> have been the objects of <hi>his</hi> conſideration. I know no method, but, with an honeſt candour, to throw yourſelf, a fair, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting object, on his generous <hi>protection.</hi> If by any <hi>concealment,</hi> you ſhould hurt that ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious dignity and affection, which will, always, attend ſuch a mind, as this, he will never again ſue to your <hi>clemency,</hi> but leave you to ruminate on the artifices, you have uſed, in an hopeleſs repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

If you really, feel an affection for him, and can indulge it with <hi>prudence,</hi> do not ſcruple to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or to treat him with the greateſt <hi>openneſs</hi> and candour. This will engage, for ever, the eſteem of every <hi>liberal</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi> man. If, from <hi>any</hi> circumſtances, unforeſeen at the time, you ſhould be under the neceſſity of <hi>diſmiſſing</hi> him, as a <hi>lover,</hi> you would never fail to retain him as a <hi>friend;</hi> and though, with a baſe, <hi>deſigning</hi> perſon, ſuch a conduct may expoſe you to ſome little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, yet <hi>whoſe</hi> will be the diſgrace?

                     <p>There is, generally, too much <hi>affectation</hi> of coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this intercourſe betwixt the ſexes.

                     <p>FROM the unfavourable ſketch, I have given of the morals and ſentiments of young men, it is not probable, that a woman of the greateſt merit, will have any prodigious number of admirers to <hi>diſtract</hi> her choice. Generally in the <hi>preſent</hi> ſtate of things, if a lady <hi>will</hi> be married, ſhe has a number of accommodations to make, many wiſhes to ſacrifice, and many inſtances of private taſte to be reſigned. She muſt be content with a

                     <p>An <hi>immoderate</hi> fondneſs for ſhew is a great <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</hi> It has led many a poor girl to ſacrifice herſelf to ſome illiterate boor, who had nothing but his affluence to recommend him. If ſuch ſhould ever be <hi>your</hi> misfortune, I need not mention what would be your feelings. If you was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough to avoid all <hi>other</hi> evil conſequences, (and many ſuch, experience records, but delicacy forbears to mention,) you might live to envy the ruddy <hi>un-ambitious</hi> milk-maid, whoſe toils are ſweetened by <hi>conjugal attachment,</hi> and whoſe <hi>bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> children cheer the <hi>ſeeming</hi> infelicities of life.</p>
                     <p>How wretched muſt be a woman, united to a man, whom ſhe does not prefer to every other in the world! What ſecret preferences muſt ſteal into her heart! What unquiet thoughts take

                     <p>NEVER think of marrying a <hi>weak</hi> man, in hopes of <hi>governing</hi> him. Silly people are often more peeviſh and refractory, than you would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but if you could even gain your point, and by great addreſs and management riſe to the helm, I ſhould not, by any means, congratulate your ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Women, that aſſume the reins, ſeldom manage them with dignity. Their authority breaks forth in numberleſs, petty inſtances of tyranny and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price, which only render them miſerable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as unamiable to every beholder.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:023176_0261_0FBDDDDC66ECF740"/>The quality, which ſhews a married lady to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, is a modeſt <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> of her underſtanding to the man, whom ſhe has not been aſhamed to honour with her choice.</p>
                     <p>I have frequently mentioned Milton, as peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly happy in his ideas of, what conſtitutes, <hi>conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> propriety. <hi>His</hi> Eve reveres her huſband. She liſtens to his converſation, in order to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In <hi>him,</hi> ſhe feels herſelf <hi>annihilated</hi> and abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. She always ſhews that deference and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of <hi>inferiority,</hi> which, for the ſake of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> the all wiſe Author of nature, <hi>manifiſtly,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The conſequence is, that her character appears lovely to all, and that her aſſociate, (as all ſenſible men <hi>will,</hi>) treats her with <hi>double</hi> tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and gives her every mark of a delicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>He in delight</l>
                        <l>Both of her beauty, and <hi>ſubmiſſive</hi> charms,</l>
                        <l>Smil'd with ſuperior love.</l>
                        <l>To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorn'd,</l>
                        <l>My <hi>author</hi> and diſpoſer, what <hi>thou</hi> bidd'ſt,</l>
                        <l>Unargu'd I obey; ſo <hi>God</hi> ordains;</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>God</hi> is <hi>thy</hi> law; <hi>thou,</hi> mine; to know <hi>no more</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Is <hi>woman</hi>'s happieſt knowledge and her praiſe.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>When men have lived ſingle for fifty or ſixty years, through a multiplicity of buſineſs, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſchemes, or perhaps from more <hi>criminal</hi> cauſes, it is no uncommon thing to ſee them, all at once, determined on wedlock, and paying their court to ſome fine, <hi>blooming</hi> girl of <hi>eighteen.</hi> Indeed, in the <hi>preſent</hi> ſtate of things, if a woman be not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>early,</hi> her chance is ſmall; ſo violent is the rage for youth and beauty, even in <hi>decrepit beaus!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="unknown:023176_0262_0FBDDDDDE9C8EA28"/>
There is ſomething in this practice, that very groſsly inſults both your delicacy and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing It looks as if theſe <hi>ſovereign lords</hi> of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the moment, when they <hi>condeſcended</hi> to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty your <hi>diſtreſs,</hi> and found no comfort in habits of another kind, could order the moſt elegant and faſhionable amongſt you, to come at a <hi>call!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true indeed, that they <hi>do</hi> make you a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Your jointure is, generally, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the age of the party. The hundreds are increaſed, as the head is hoary, as the frame is enfeebled, or as wrinkles have contracted the countenance.</p>
                     <p>Never indulge the thought of marrying in this manner. Wherever there is great <hi>diſparity</hi> of years, there cannot be any durable union of hearts. Gloom and gaiety do not eaſily aſſimilate. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has placed at a great diſtance from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the torrid and the frigid zones.</p>
                     <p>People's views of life, their ſentiments, projects, companies, pleaſures and amuſements differ ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, at theſe different ages, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible their affections ſhould be united. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand conflicts of taſte and opinion, and as many cauſes of jealouſy and diſlike will mingle with ſo <hi>injudicious</hi> a connection.</p>
                     <p>A woman, in ſuch <hi>delicate</hi> circumſtances, where the heart is not engroſſed by a <hi>real</hi> attachment, <hi>may,</hi> and probably <hi>will,</hi> ſee many perſons more agreeable, than him, to whom ſhe is bound by an indiſſoluble tie. If ſhe has prudence and principle enough to keep up appearances, and thus preſerve her innocence in the eyes of the world, it can be no <hi>ſupreme</hi> felicity to be the wife of one man, whilſt her heart is ſecretly panting for another.
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:023176_0263_0FBDDDDF68021890"/>It is indeed a trial, which no ſplendour can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence and no fortune eaſe. If ſhe ſhould ever be ſo unguarded as to <hi>betray</hi> ſuch a preference, in any part of her conduct, her peace and happineſs are loſt for ever! But admitting her to behave with the greateſt propriety, and even to be attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who owns her, Rill the <hi>jealouſy</hi> of old men is a moſt amazingly irritable paſſion. It is that watchful dragon, which guards the Heſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian fruit; and with a keen-eyed glance, will be apt to diſcover ſome hidden meaning in a look, impropriety in a geſture, or a violation of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage covenant in the moſt common civility. At any rate, it is no very flattering allotment to a woman, to be the <hi>nurſe</hi> of a peaviſh, infirm or en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What woman of ſpirit would <hi>bear</hi> to be ſuſpected? What chriſtian ſhould vow, at the <hi>altar</hi> of her God, an affection to a <hi>man,</hi> when her attachment was ſolely to his fortune? And who that has read one page of human life, muſt not tremble at the conſequences, that have generally, attended ſuch imprudent connexions?</p>
                     <p>"A reformed rake makes the beſt huſband." Does he? It would be very extraordinary, if he ſhould. Beſides, are you very certain, that you have <hi>power</hi> to reform him? It is a matter, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome deliberation. This reformation, if it <hi>is</hi> to be accompliſhed, muſt take place before mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. <hi>Then</hi> if <hi>ever,</hi> is the period of <hi>your</hi> power. But how will you be aſſured that he is reformed? If he <hi>appears</hi> ſo, is he not inſidiouſly <hi>concealing</hi> his vices, to gain your affections? And when he knows, they are ſecured, may he not, gradually, throw off the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:023176_0264_0FBDDDE0E6714F00"/>maſk, and be diſſipated, as before? Profligacy of this kind is ſeldom eradicated. It reſembles ſome <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous</hi> diſorders, which <hi>appear</hi> to be healed, and yet are, continually, making themſelves viſible by freſh eruptions.</p>
                     <p>A man, who has carried on a criminal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with immoral women is not to be truſted, His opinion of <hi>all</hi> females is an inſult to their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. His attachment is to <hi>ſex</hi> alone, under par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>modifications.</hi> On <hi>him</hi> virtue, knowledge, accompliſhments and graces are miſerably thrown away. To gratify an inextinguiſhable thirſt for <hi>variety,</hi> ſuch a wretch is often ſeen to forſake the moſt deſerving wife, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>What would you think of this? Yet no graces, no affection, no delicacy, on your part, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prevent it. It ſeems the <hi>curſe</hi> of heaven, entailed on his vices, and, generally, purſues him even to the grave.</p>
                     <p>The ſuppoſed predilection of your ſex for <hi>rakes,</hi> muſt, probably, ariſe from their oſtentatious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, gaiety, ſpirits and aſſumed politeneſs.

                     <p>MEN in profeſſions may be expected to poſſeſs the moſt <hi>liberal</hi> ſentiments, as having enjoyed a ſuperior education; and their manners and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will, of courſe, be moſt agreeable and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ladies. Military people are, <hi>proverbially,</hi> favourites.</p>
                     <p>I will not ſo much degrade the dignity of your ſex, as to ſuppoſe, that it is the mere colour of their habits, which <hi>dazzles</hi> your eyes, and works ſuch aſtoniſhing <hi>miracles</hi> in their favour. There are reaſons, which may account, more <hi>rationally,</hi> for your partiality, whilſt they do more credit to your underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Undiſtracted with cares and buſineſs, they are happy in that eaſy <hi>diſengagedneſs</hi> of mind, which can exhauſt all its efforts upon the ſingle article of <hi>pleaſing.</hi> With much time upon their hands, they have frequent opportunities of being in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and of feeling, or at leaſt <hi>affecting</hi> admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Lively and volatile from an healthy life of activity and exerciſe, they eaſily aſſimilate with the manners of a ſex, whoſe diſtinguiſhing grace is a cheerful vivacity. Having travelled through va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places and kingdoms, they neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that eaſe and urbanity of manners, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from a <hi>general</hi> intercourſe with mankind.— Expected, <hi>profeſſionally,</hi> to be men of courage, you may <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> them the beſt protectors of your perſon and your weakneſs. Their very choice of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marks them for <hi>genteel</hi> notions and ſpirit;
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:023176_0266_0FBDDDE3E7476B80"/>and any of theſe reaſons is, perhaps, no diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage with a female heart. I ſhould be ſorry to ſuppoſe, that their general love of pleaſure, gaiety and <hi>intrigue</hi> is amongſt their recommendations to the favour of thoſe, who <hi>ſhould,</hi> uniformly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage by their <hi>bluſhes</hi> and their <hi>frowns,</hi> every ſpecies of levity and vice.</p>
                     <p>In fact, and to be impartial, the agreeableneſs of officers, is like that of <hi>other</hi> men. There is the <hi>human</hi> mixture of the good and the bad. I have always found, from my own obſervation, that the older and experienced are ſome of the moſt intereſting characters in ſociety. The vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcenes, through which they have paſſed, give a ſprightlineſs and <hi>diverſity</hi> to their converſation, and their politeneſs lends it a charm. I have met with no many of the <hi>younger</hi> ſort, who have ſeemed to think the <hi>petty</hi> ornament of a cockade an adequate ſubſtitute for all improvements of the mind; a ſhelter for litigious inſolence and <hi>puppyiſm,</hi> and an excluſive ſecurity for the tendereſt affections, and attachment of woman.</p>
                     <p>But this evil is not conſined, merely, to the <hi>army.</hi> It is ſo in the church. How truly amiable are the experienced, the learned, and the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary of this profeſſion, whoſe knowledge is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily tiſſued with devotion, and ſoftened by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral intercourſe with the world! How many, on the other hand, when they are juſt initiated into the ſacred office, ridiculouſly pique themſelves on a <hi>caſſock</hi> and a <hi>ſcarf;</hi> and, under that ſolemn garb, go as far as poſſible, in the mazes of beauiſm, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and affectation!</p>
                     <p>There are, doubtleſs, very amiable people in the army; but their <hi>general</hi> notions and treatment
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:023176_0267_0FBDDDE566CC1D18"/>of your ſex, forbid me to wiſh that you ſhould, ever, cultivate much acquaintance with them, becauſe the circumſtances, in which they are placed, render the thoughts of a <hi>ſerious</hi> connection, by no means deſirable. If we could ſuppoſe their <hi>principles</hi> not to be injured by their <hi>mode</hi> of life; if they could reſign, from the moment of marriage, all their notions of unlimited gallantry, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, what is their pay, but a ſcanty ſubſiſtence for a ſolitary individual? What is their life, but an unſettled pilgrimage from one country to anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? How often are they called, at a <hi>moment's</hi> warning, to ſight, perhaps, to <hi>periſh,</hi> for their king and country? or, to die more ſuddenly, and more ignominiouſly, by the hands of a Dueliſt, who challenges them into <hi>eternity</hi> for the ſlighteſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, perhaps for the miſplacing only of a ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!</p>
                     <p>In the midſt of ſuch alarming proſpects, what has a woman to expect from marriage with them, but continual toils, unceaſing dangers, perpetual apprehenſions; poverty, remorſe, vexation, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, without proviſion, and ſorrows, which the <hi>lenient</hi> hand of time, ſcarcely can aſſuage.</p>
                     <p>If you was ever ſo happily united to a man of this deſcription, how dreadful muſt be the abſenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, you will have to bear, mixed as they will be, with a diſſolving tenderneſs, and unavoidable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms; or, on the other hand, how inſupportable your toils, <q>with perils in the wilderneſs, perils by the ſea, and perils amongſt falſe brethren; with wearineſs, and painfulneſs, with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, often; with hunger and thirſt; with faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, often; with cold and nakedneſs.</q> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the fate of lady C—w—s, and drop a tear.
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:023176_0268_0FBDDDE6EA989250"/>That gaiety of heart, which, <hi>once,</hi> doted on a man for his ſmartneſs or vivacity, will find <hi>too much</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe for its penitence and grief in ſuch <hi>ſerious</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>

                     <p>A great writer has called a phyſician, "the mere play-thing of fortune."

                     <p>I do not think the profeſſion of the <hi>law,</hi> calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to render a man, the moſt agreeable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in the ſtill, unruffled ſhades of domeſtic life. It calls into continual exerciſe, the more <hi>turbid</hi> paſſions; it begets an unpleaſant ſpirit of caviling
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:023176_0269_0FBDDDE868B29440"/>and contradiction, and has leſs tendency to nurſe the <hi>finer</hi> feelings, than any of the other learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
                     <p>By being crowded together, at a <hi>dangerous</hi> age, in the Temple or Lincoln's Inn, young men are apt to contract a licentiouſneſs of <hi>morals,</hi> a <hi>laxity</hi> of principles, a ſpecies of <hi>ſcepticiſm</hi> to palliate their vices, habits of <hi>profaneneſs,</hi> not a little diſſipation, and ſo far as <hi>your</hi> ſex is concerned, very dangerous notions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Before</hi> marriage, military men and young law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers are not, in my idea, the ſafeſt acquaintance. The firſt are only bent, without looking any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on <hi>domeſticating</hi> themſelves, in agreeable families, by every polite attention to <hi>wives and daughters,</hi> and thus amuſing many, leiſure hours, which, in their ſtate of continual peregrination, would be, otherwiſe, inſupportable; the latter, in general, ſcruple not to go great lengths in gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where they have no <hi>ſerious</hi> intention.</p>
                     <p>Beware of <hi>ſuch</hi> ſociety; beware of your <hi>heart.</hi> Let not the <hi>unbluſhing</hi> front of a barriſter, let not the mere <hi>ſcarlet habit</hi> of a <hi>petit maitre,</hi> who has ſtudied the windings of the female heart, infinitely more, than tacties, or the art of war, let not a few civil ſayings or flattering attentions beguile your imagination, or lay your prudence aſleep. I do not think the commerce very ſafe. If I had a girl of my own, I would not expoſe her to ſo <hi>dangerous</hi> a trial. Many, doubtleſs, have come off conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, but <hi>more</hi> have fallen; and their wounds and tears have made, upon <hi>my</hi> memory, a <hi>laſting</hi> impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Our imagination, however, annexes riches, honours, and even titles to the profeſſion of the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:023176_0270_0FBDDDE9E7FCC930"/>law. But this fancy often <hi>miſleads</hi> us. It is true, that merit has a greater chance in <hi>this,</hi> than in any other profeſſion; and it is certain, that a fortunate <hi>few</hi> have attained to very conſiderable greatneſs. We hear of a Mansfield, a Thurlow, a Kenyon, a Lough borough, a Law, an Erſkine, and are dazzled with their names, their ſucceſs, and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. But not a word is ſaid of a thouſand others of the fraternity, whom, though poſſeſſed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable talents, fortune never choſe to bring into the public view, or to diſtinguiſh with any of her favours.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe diſcouragements apart, if a lawyer is <hi>eminent,</hi> he can ſcarcely ever be at <hi>home. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual</hi> cares and buſineſs ſurround him, and poiſon his repoſe. His wife and children muſt be <hi>neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and domeſtic endearments ſacrificed to <hi>tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> cares. And if he be poor, no poverty can open the door to more chicanery, artifice, or meanneſs. At <hi>any</hi> rate, if he be a man of pure morals and religious principles, he has withſtood the greateſt temptations, that human nature can encounter, and for ſuperior and heroic virtue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſerves a place in the kalendar of ſaints.</p>
                     <p>See now a man's partiality to his <hi>own</hi> profeſſion; but if it be not founded in reaſon, I beg you will reject it.</p>
                     <p>The office of <hi>clergymen</hi> calls them to a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and retired life, than that of moſt other men.

                     <p>A man of <hi>this</hi> caſt ſeems particularly calculated not only to <hi>reliſh,</hi> but to <hi>enhance</hi> the happineſs of a married ſtate. With hours at command, he has leiſure for the tender offices of friendſhip, and the little, <hi>ſportive</hi> play fulneſs of amuſing converſation. Whilſt the woodbine and the jaſmine ſurround his modeſt manſion, he dreads no <hi>unpropitous</hi> accident, that ſhall drag him from his retreat, and can tread, with the faithful partner of his cares, the lonely "ſilent haunts, which contemplation loves." He has time for ſuperintending the inſtruction of his children, and calling their latent powers into exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and action. He has opportunity to <hi>realize</hi> the pictures of a Milton, and watch the opening beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>paradiſe</hi> about him.</p>
                     <p>Let me, however, be candid, and give you the <hi>poſſible</hi> reverſe of this piece. The church is in a very unhappy ſituation. That education, which renders the eccleſiaſtic agreeable, often ſharpens his affliction. That refinement, which captivates the elegant and inexperienced, is the ſpear, which fetches drops of blood from his heart. Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without an <hi>adequate</hi> proviſion, and incapable, by any <hi>ſecular</hi> employment, of <hi>improving</hi> his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, theſe <hi>apparent</hi> privileges are only his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. The ſenſibility, which <hi>loves</hi> a woman, doubly mourns her allotment. That tenderneſs, which embraces children with ſuch affection, <hi>ſhudders</hi> at their proſpects. That independence, which reſults from <hi>liberal</hi> ſentiments, ſtartles at the thought of poverty or diſtreſs; and that peace, which he has found in the abodes of <hi>ſolitude,</hi> unties him for the <hi>turbulent</hi> agitations of the world.</p>

Many men, however, there are in this profeſſion, very amply provided for; and, if one of theſe falls to your lot, with the habits and diſpoſitions, that <hi>ſhould</hi> reſult from his character, I think you may form every <hi>rational</hi> hope of comfort and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Still, do not ſuppoſe me narrow or illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.

And as your heart is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged, I meant only to ſtate the influence of different habits and employments on the mind, and the probability of their conducing to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery in this <hi>important</hi> connection. And I <hi>ſtill</hi> muſt urge, that if a clergyman <hi>be</hi> a bad huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, it is in defiance of the ſtrongeſt <hi>inducements</hi> to be <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> and of every diſpoſition, which his ſtudies and his prayers ſhould have led him, either to cultivate in <hi>himſelf,</hi> or recommend to <hi>others.</hi>

                     <p>The truth is, the gentleman was ſtrictly in the language of the world, a <hi>beau d'eſprit,</hi> that is, he dreſſed ſmartly, frequented (what is eſteemed)

In proportion as theſe little matters had engaged his mind, ſmall attention had, you may ſuppoſe, been paid to the formation of his heart or underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>In this thoughtleſs period, it was the misfortune of this poor girl, with an elegant perſon and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting manner, to fall in his way. She was beautiful; nature had deſigned her to pleaſe; and, if ſhe had been connected with a ſenſible man, might have been moulded almoſt into any thing, that captivates in gracefulneſs, or aſtoniſhes in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Her perſonal accompliſhments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired this <hi>petit maitre</hi> with a <hi>fugitive</hi> paſſion; his fortune was competent; diſſimilarity of taſtes, habits or abilities never was conſidered; tender tales were ſwallowed by her artleſs innocence, and his addreſſes were accepted. After a very ſhort acquaintance, they are weary of each other. The force of beauty and of paſſion is exhauſted. He has not taſte enough for the delicacies of friendſhip, nor knowledge to entertain a lonely hour with edifying converſation, but flies to the bottle and his mad companions, for pleaſures, which it is not in <hi>her</hi> power to beſtow; whilſt ſhe, poor creature! has leiſure to brood over her imprudence and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes in ſtill, domeſtic ſcenes, having learned, but alas! too late, that rational and <hi>durable</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment is only to be found with a perſon of virtue, principle and underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>For my own part, I had never any idea of ſuch <hi>early</hi> marriages. If this girl had ſeen the <hi>world,</hi> and a variety of characters, ſhe would not have ſubmitted to ſuch a connection; and if he had

                     <p>Beſides, what knowledge can a girl, at <hi>her</hi> age, have of the government of a family, or the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of <hi>domeſtic</hi> concerns? Servants will take advantage of her <hi>inexperience;</hi> and ſhe muſt either be made a <hi>dupe</hi> to their artifices, or, from a narrow ſyſtem of jealouſy and ſuſpicion, ſhe will loſe their confidence, and become the object of their <hi>perſecution.</hi>

We mingled ſouls at our firſt meeting, and they have never ſince, diſcorded for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Eugenio is a man of conſiderable learning, and ſtill greater taſte. In every thing that relates to polite knowledge, he has not many ſuperiors in his age. He is complete maſter of muſic, painting and poetry. In architecture, his ſkill is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.

                     <p>Their fortune is juſt, what it ſhould be, for ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id contentment; too little to inſpire a fantaſtic emulation with the manners of the <hi>great</hi> world; too large to admit of embarraſſment or want. It is, in ſhort, neither more nor leſs, than £ 1000 <hi>per annum.</hi> Their family conſiſts of two fine boys, and one girl, who is half as amiable, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, as Louiſa.</p>
                     <p>Though the faſhionable world would think ſuch circumſtances narrow, yet that economy, which can do <hi>every</hi> thing, has made them very comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and their entire complacency in each other's company, rich indeed! They do not diſſipate their fortune in expenſive journeys to, or by reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in, the metropolis, and are too happy in

                     <p>This, my dear LUCY, is the happieſt of lives.—After all our ambition, and all our ſtruggles, it is chiefly in the <hi>ſhade,</hi> that we muſt find contentment. The pleaſures <hi>there</hi> are calm; they are pleaſures of the <hi>heart.</hi>

                     <p>Their houſe is ſituated, at two miles diſtance from a conſiderable town in the county of —, upon an eminence, which commands a full view of the city, but has its aſpect to thoſe woods and ſhades, with which its owners are infinitely more converſant, than the more noiſy ſcenes of diſſipated life. Elegant, but not ſuperb, and ſpacious, tho' plain, it expreſſes the cultivated taſte of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and the hoſpitable kindneſs that reigns within.</p>
                     <p>The pleaſure grounds and gardens are in that unornamented ſtyle, which to me, is always par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly pleaſing. Nature has not been wholly ſacrificed to art, nor wildneſs to refinement.—The wilderneſs here and there preſents you with all its ſhaggy luxuriance, and venerable glooms.—You rove imboſomed in woods and thickets, and are mingled at a diſtance from every prying eye, in thoſe ſilent haunts of ſolitude, which poetry has always decked with its charms. Here the hand of the Creator has formed a grotto, and art has not deſtroyed it; there an alcove, and the pruning knife has not <hi>officiouſly</hi> ſeparated the intwining branches. In one place, a little fountain murmurs, at its eaſe, and nothing has attempted to divert it from its original channel. In another you have tufted beauties, a caſcade, a lawn, an hill or a valley, beautifully interſperſed, exactly as they
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:023176_0282_0FBDDDFBE9582310"/>were formed by the hand of nature, in one of thoſe more ſportive moments, when ſhe wiſhed to pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Through the branches of a beautiful hanging wood, which lies before the houſe, you deſcry the glittering ſpire of the pariſh church, belonging to the village, of which Eugenio is the patron, and a very exemplary clergyman, the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent. It is placed on a <hi>riſing</hi> ground, as if continually aſpiring to that heaven, to which its excellent paſtor is always calling the affections of his people. It is built in that gothic ſtyle, which I always moſt approved in this ſacred kind of ſtructure, as beſt adapted to inſpire the mind with ſeriouſneſs and devotion. But it is not from the mere beauty of the place, or the deliciouſneſs of its ſituation, that its enviable owners derive their happineſs. They expect not from ſhrubs or bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, or the moſt enchanting ſcenery, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the heart. They know, that the richeſt proſpects would ſoon fade upon the eye, if they did not derive a freſh and lively bloom from princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>within.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In an age of levity, this happy pair are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to be thought religious. They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that their bleſſings could have no <hi>permanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> or reliſh, if unſanctified with the ſmile and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of heaven. Their houſe is, in fact, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where prayers and praiſes, are regularly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, every night and morning, to the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and preſerver of their lives. Every ſervant is required to attend the ſervice; and they are all <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally,</hi> inſtructed in their duties to God and man. They have likewiſe, each a little library of devotional tracts, which have been preſented to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:023176_0283_0FBDDDFD67A15708"/>them by their generous ſuperiors. I had the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity one day, to examine the title pages, and found them, principally to conſiſt of the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of a Religious Life; Beveridge's Private Thought, and Reſolutions; Taylor's Holy Living and Dying; Advice againſt ſwearing, drunkenneſs, profanneſs, &amp;c. in little tracts from the Society, for promoting Chriſtian Knowledge; Wilſon on the Sacrament; the Chriſtian Pattern; Henry's Pleaſantneſs of a Religious Life, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It would delight you to obſerve with what a mixture of love and reverence, theſe ſervants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their <hi>real</hi> benefactors. You hear nothing, under <hi>this</hi> roof of thoſe feuds and animoſines, which ſo much embitter the happineſs of families. "They live as brethren together in unity." The only contention is, which ſhall be moſt ardent, aſſiduous and vigilant in the performance of their duty.</p>
                     <p>If Maria (Eugenio's lady,) has the <hi>ſlighteſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, you might read it, without aſking a ſyllable, in the anxious looks and geſtures of all her attendants. She was lately confined with a nervous fever: and it would have aſtoniſhed you to ſee the unaffected grief and concern, expreſſed in their looks. <q>What (ſaid they) will become of our excellent maſter, if he ſhould loſe the moſt amiable woman in the world?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The piety of theſe people is the more engaging, becauſe it is always <hi>cheerful</hi> and ſerene. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from <hi>reaſen,</hi> and it encourages no <hi>unnatural</hi> authority or gloom. It is mixed with ſentiment; it is graced with knowledge, and guided by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, Who wold not pique himſelf on a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023176_0284_0FBDDDFEE84C48C0"/>with ſuch a family? Who would not wiſh that friendſhip to be eternal?</p>
                     <p>When I have added <hi>you</hi> to the group, I fancy myſelf in poſſeſſion of almoſt every thing, that mortality can give, and wiſh only the continuance of my enjoyments.</p>

                     <p>MANY people of fortune are uncomfortable in marriage, for want of <hi>employment,</hi> or of ſomething to give an <hi>intereſt</hi> to the, otherwiſe, <hi>inſipid</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the ſame excurſions, viſits, company, or entertainments. This is never the caſe within the walls of Eugenio. He is always introducing, from incidents as they riſe, ſome uſeful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining topics of converſation. A news-paper, books, the garden, flowers, plants, ſhrubs, hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the azure vault of heaven, ſtars, planets, or even a common <hi>inſect,</hi> furniſh to this worthy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ample ſubjects for obſervation, ever edifying, and ever new. His lady has taſte and information enough to enter into the ſpirit of all theſe deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the <hi>general</hi> ſcene is, not a little enliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the mode, in which they treat and educate their children.</p>
                     <p>My good friend is perſuaded, that public educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is <hi>generally</hi> managed, is more calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to teach languages and ſcience, than to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>principles</hi> or <hi>morals;</hi> and, therefore, keeps his ſons at home till they have acquired a ſufficient
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:023176_0285_0FBDDE0067C751B0"/>ſtock of virtue to ſerve them as an antidote againſt the dangers of the world. They have, however, their regular ſchool hours and exerciſes, which are obſerved with the moſt undeviating punctuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The older of the boys has made a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proficiency in the Latin Language. He has abridged the Engliſh and the Roman hiſtories, and is completely verſed in heathen mythology. But, above all, he is inſtructed in the fundamentals of religion, and of his duty to God and man. The ſcriptures make a part of his daily reading; and the ſenſible parent embelliſhes them with ſuch a number of ſtriking obſervations, as greatly intereſt the <hi>curioſity,</hi> and fix the attention of his unvitiated pupil.</p>
                     <p>With Rollin's Belles Lettres, and the Abbe Millot's <hi>Elementes ſur l'hiſtoire,</hi> he is perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. The latter he is abridging; and Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus is warmly preſſed on his attention, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thoſe immortal leſſons of virtue, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can dignify any character or ſtation.</p>
                     <p>Eugenio has been at the pains of throwing ſelect parts of Seneca, Marcus Antoninus, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morabillia of Xenophon into an Engliſh dreſs, for the advantage of his little family. He has ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſyſtem of Ethics, and almoſt of divinity, from the entertaining works of Addiſon, Johnſon, The World,  and the arrangement is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The firſt morning, that I ſpent under this happy roof, I was awakened from my ſlumbers by the ſoft harmonious voice of Miſs—, who was chanting to the harpſicord, an early hymn of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:023176_0286_0FBDDE01E702C548"/>and devotion to her merciful Creator. It was taken from the Spectator.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>When all thy mercies, O my God,</l>
                        <l>My riſing ſoul ſurveys;</l>

                     </q>
                     <p>The whole reminded me of the words of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious poet:</p>

                        </lg>
                     </q>
                     <p>This is her conſtant practice every morning, at ſix o'clock; and it has the happieſt effect on her temper and ſpirits, for the reſt of the day. It ſooths the ſoul to harmony, and cheriſhes all the gentler emotions.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after this was finiſhed, the lovely girl took a walk into the garden, as ſhe regularly does, when the weather will permit, to obſerve the gradual progreſs, health and vegetation of her plants and flowers. I requeſted the honor of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending her, and was amazed, young as ſhe is, with her knowledge of natural hiſtory, and with the judicious remarks ſhe made on the power and goodneſs, on the wiſdom and contrivance of the magnificent Creator.</p>
                     <p>Before breakfaſt, Maria (their mother,) hears all the children together read the pſalms and leſſons for the day. To this pious exerciſe I was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited; but I doubt not it was a ſpecimen of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male eloquence, deſcanting on the vanity of every
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:023176_0287_0FBDDE036931E9E8"/>thing, but devotion, and glancing at the dangers and temptations of the world.</p>
                     <p>The employment of this good family is as ſtrict, as uſual, and not leſs pleaſing even upon Sundays.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> exerciſe of this day, after the accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hymn of praiſe to their Creator, is to abridge a few pages of Wilſon's Indian Inſtructed, or of Secker's Lectures on the Catechiſm. After the ſervice, all the children give in, to the beſt of their power, an account of the ſermon, which they have heard. The compariſon of their different merits is pleaſing, and the very <hi>conteſt</hi> excites emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>this</hi> is finiſhed their father inſtructs them with a ſhort <hi>comment</hi> on the leſſons for the day. One happened to be the hiſtory of <hi>Dives and Lazarus.</hi> Very few have greater powers of the pathetic than my friend. He brought them all to tears with dwelling on the pitiable circumſtances of the <hi>beggar,</hi> and poured this leſſon into their <hi>ſoftened</hi> minds, that riches are <hi>apt</hi> to harden the heart, and have no real dignity or uſe, but as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in acts of <hi>mercy</hi> to our <hi>neighbour.</hi> He gave, to the parable at large, a new and <hi>ſingular</hi> aſpect. He obſerved, that luxury had led Dives to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and that unbelief had plunged him into hell.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>another</hi> occaſion, he dwelt on the ſcriptural hiſtory of Haman. In him, he expatiated on the uncertainty and ſickleneſs of all outward greatneſs, and the inſufficiency of honours, ſtations, popular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to confer any <hi>real</hi> happineſs on a mind, that had not ſubmitted to <hi>internal</hi> government and the diſcipline of religion.</p>
                     <p>

"What a trifle (ſaid he,) deranged this great man's enjoyment! Becauſe a poor Mordecai would not bow to his pomp, his honours loſt their flavour, and his dignities their charm; his ſleep went from him, and he refuſed to be comforted. If his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions had been ſubdued, and his ſould regenerated with divine grace, he would have been contented in the loweſt obſcurity. A cottage would have given him more ſatisfaction than this palace. It would have been irradiated with hope, and it would have ſmiled with divine conſolations."</p>
                     <p>Eugenio is conſtant at <hi>church,</hi> and his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is an excellent pattern to all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandents. His features are marked with a ſerious fervour, and a cheerful dignity, when he is humbly preſenting his ſupplications to the author of his being.</p>
                     <p>You would be charmed to ſee how the honeſt peaſants dwell on his looks! what eulogies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in every countenance! what fervent bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are poured forth, when he ſtops to enquire about their families and concerns, and what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt wiſhes, that his manſion may long retain him, for its owner, and that his continuance amongſt them, may be laſting as their days!</p>
                     <p>Not behind him in any of the <hi>milder</hi> virtues, his conſort <hi>looks up</hi> to him, with a conſcious infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, as the pride of her heart. Blended with more <hi>Jofineſs,</hi> her piety is, if poſſible, ſtill more engaging; but ſhe ſeems to decline all <hi>perſonal</hi> conſequence, and to be wholly abſorbed in the ſuperior luſtre of his character and virtues. She receives the prayers and bleſſings of their tenants, as if only due to the man of her affections; and, though the zeal of the populace would convey her, in their <hi>arms,</hi> yet, when Eugenio offers his hand
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:023176_0289_0FBDDE06682C7C20"/>to lift her into the carriage, her eyes ſparkle with peculiar cheerfulneſs, and ſtrongly expreſs both her love and gratitude to her protector and her friend.</p>
                     <p>It is no wonder that they are ſo much admired. No wonder that every tongue loads them with bleſſings. This is but the <hi>ſpeculative</hi> part of their piety; the <hi>practical</hi> is more uſeful and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging. They love their God; they love their Redeemer, and for his ſake they go about doing good. Not a tenant experiences an uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble year, but he receives a conſiderable abatement in his rent. Not a perſon is injured in all the neighbourhood, but his cauſe is pleaded, and his wrongs are redreſſed. Not an old man exiſts, but he has ſomething, by way of <hi>penſion,</hi> from this virtuous family, to eaſe his infirmities, and pillow his declining age. Not a great man endeavours to take advantage of a leſſer, but my friend, who is an excellent lawyer, undertakes the buſineſs, and expoſes the oppreſſor to his merited contempt.</p>
                     <p>Every hour, that Maria can ſpare from her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular domeſtic employments, is ſpent in making garments, providing cordials, phyſic and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations for the naked, the ſick and indigent of her village; and there are times of the day, in which you would conclude, from the vaſt concourſe of people, that their houſe was a profeſſed <hi>aſylum</hi> for poverty and diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>But now comes out <hi>the great ſecret of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> "Alas!" ſaid this good man to me, one night, after ſupper, when he was reviewing the actions of the day, <q>your obliging partiality thinks me happy, and ſo inded I <hi>am.</hi> In the tenderneſs, friendſhip, fidelity and diſcretion of

And, when I drop into the grave, I ſhall have but one ſingle wiſh, that this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able guide may be ſpared to my offspring, and that the poor may pronounce a laſt panegyric on me, with their prayers and tears. But how very ſelfiſh and how cruel is the deſire! What would become of the, <hi>then,</hi> lonely and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Maria?

Thus the ſcriptural images <q>of thrones, ſceptres, kingdoms, of ſhining as the ſtars of the firmament, of being clothed in white robes, and having palms in our hands, of

                     <p>So ſtrong and literally juſt is that paſſage; <q>Eye has not ſeen nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things, which God has prepared for them, that love him.</q>

                     <p>That we ſhall be able to recognize <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and amongſt others, thoſe of our neareſt <hi>intimates</hi> after death, is <hi>probable</hi> from the very nature of the ſoul, which cannot be ſuppoſed to loſe its <hi>conſciouſneſs</hi> or <hi>recollection,</hi> whilſt the body is ſleeping in the duſt of the earth—from the poſſibility, that an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite part of future happineſs will ariſe from review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, along with <hi>preſent</hi> friends, the trials, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſorrows, which we overcame, along
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023176_0293_0FBDDE0C69042EE0"/>with them, upon earth—and, more eſpecially, from the attributes of God, which ſeem <hi>pledged</hi> to convince us, by, (as it were,) <hi>ocular</hi> demonſtration, that thoſe, who, we are well aſſured, ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly, in various methods here, are reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereafter, and that ſome guilty perſons, who wanted no proſperities in <hi>this</hi> world, experience all the horrors of another.</p>
                     <p>To this doctrine, there is but one weak, and ill-founded objection; that witneſſing the miſery of friends, if they died in a ſinful ſtate, muſt be a dreadful abatement of our own felicity. That is impoſſible. The affection betwixt relatives <hi>here</hi> was implanted only for <hi>temporary</hi> purpoſes, and will, in ſome caſes, ceaſe after death. The only attachment, <hi>then,</hi> will be, (as the only <hi>rational</hi> one, <hi>always was,</hi>) to ſouls, that <hi>aſſimilate</hi> in <hi>real wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, purity and goodneſs.</hi> We ſhall love, in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, even as <hi>God</hi> loveth, not with the weakneſs of paſſion or inſtinct, but the unchangable ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>order.</hi> 
                        <q>They, that do the will of our Father in heaven, will be our fathers and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our ſiſters and mothers.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>How glorious and inexhauſtible a ſource of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs does ſuch a proſpect open to the mind! With what rapture will a tender mother, who left a number of children behind her, with a thouſand, anxious apprehenſions for their ſafety, meet them in heaven, where their innocence is crowned, their trials are finiſhed, and their eternal happineſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured! With what dutiful tranſports will children embrace the religious parent, to whoſe counſels <hi>under Providence,</hi> they owe conſiderably their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent glorification! And what delight muſt it give both parties to reflect, that death can, no more,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:023176_0294_0FBDDE0DE78412D8"/>divorce them from each other, nor a grain of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row poiſon their cup of bliſs! Affectionate broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſiſters, <hi>unavoidably</hi> ſevered <hi>here,</hi> by various, important exigences, with what ardour will they renew their natural connection, and reciprocate each other's joys! Not a fear to riſe upon their future proſpects, not a cloud to darken the celeſtial ſky!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Another</hi> delightful idea of heaven is, that it will bring to <hi>maturity</hi> all thoſe amiable inſtincts, which were planted in us by the Deity, whilſt we were on earth, but from a multitude of obſtacles, or the ſhortneſs of life, could not attain their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p>Our ſtrong thirſt for happineſs, it is, on all hands, allowed, that was only mocked in a world of <hi>ſhadows,</hi> will be fully gratified in one of glory.</p>
                     <p>It will, probably, be ſo with our paſſion for knowledge — friendſhip—ſociety — which, when properly directed, are equally virtuous and uſeful, propenſities, and, therefore, alike proceed from the Author of every perfect gift.</p>
                     <p>How eagerly do ſome men thirſt after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but how much are they retarded in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, by the imperfection of their preſent organs, the weakneſs of their bodily frame, by the long, loſt ſpace of childhood and old age, by the want of books, acquaintance, and other opportunities, or by the tranſitorineſs of life itſelf!—or when all human advantages center in one, privileged man, enlightened as he may <hi>ſeem,</hi> what is his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but comparative folly?

                     <p>But how ſublime will be the pleaſures of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe in heaven, when the greateſt men, that have ever lived, are all collected together from all quarters of the world! When there are no little envies, jealouſies, intereſts or bigotries to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their mutual concord and improvements! nor any languor, fatigue or diſeaſe in the renovat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frame!

The wondrous page of nature will then be plain. The book of Providence will open, in the moſt legible charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, on the enlarged mind. That myſtery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, into which the very angels have been deſirous to look, will be unfolded, in all its abyſſes; and the conſequence of ſuch diſcoveries muſt be an inexpreſſible ſenſation of love, aſtoniſhment and rapture. <q>We ſhall not ceaſe, day or night, to worſhip him, that ſitteth on the throne, and the Lamb, that has waſhed us from our ſins, in his own blood.</q>

The amiable of all ages and nations ſhall be aſſembled together, frailties and death, and the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of ſeparation, wholly done away!</p>
                     <p>Think only of the expanſion and luxury the mind enjoys from unboſoming its pleaſures or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows to a perſon upon earth, from the ſocial glow and confidential converſation! and imagine, for a moment, what this privilege muſt be, where all around us are friends—where friends are angels— and angels are continually imbibing freſh ſtreams of knowledge, of purity and graces in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their God!</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>ſocial</hi> inſtinct likewiſe, will, doubtleſs, have a <hi>ſimilar</hi> gratification. People are drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into <hi>ſocieties</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> by a ſimilarity of taſtes, purſuits, habits and improvements. The principle is <hi>natural</hi> and has many <hi>laudable</hi> effects; and from the nature of the human ſoul, which will, probably, be going through ſucceſſive ſtages of improvement to all eternity, may be ſuppoſed likely to <hi>continue</hi> in a glorified ſtate. Thus, though holineſs and purity be the <hi>alone</hi> medium of <hi>admiſſion</hi> into theſe bleſſed manſions, yet ſocieties may be formed of people of ſimilar improvements and congenial taſtes; of holy philoſophers, (ſuppoſe,) naturaliſts, divines, doubly endeared by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, and carrying their various reſearches to perfection, in a world, where knowledge is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unobſtructed, and in the preſence of him, from whom all wiſdom and all goodneſs flows. Whilſt the different manſions of heaven may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,

                     <p>Thus much, at leaſt, may be fairly inferred, that the <hi>intellectual</hi> improvements, we have made <hi>here,</hi> will not <hi>periſh</hi> in the <hi>grave.</hi> We ſhall, doubtleſs, in this reſpect, riſe with the ſame views and <hi>habits of thinking,</hi> with which we died. How much men at preſent, differ, from this cauſe alone, ſo that the <hi>leaſt,</hi> and the <hi>moſt</hi> enlightened, almoſt appear creatures of <hi>another ſpecies,</hi> needs not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And, though a Boyle or a Bacon, would from an union in <hi>goodneſs</hi> only, be happy in the converſation of the moſt illiterate ſaint, yet, on all principles of <hi>analogy,</hi> it may, reaſonably, be preſumed, that their bliſs could not fail to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely heightened by the ſociety of thoſe, who, like them, had ſpent a whole life in laudable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigations.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>grand</hi> idea is, that the "great I AM will be preſent!" He, who is the ſource of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and bleſſings! He, who can open, in the mind, innumerable avenues of <hi>inconceivable</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Whoſe whole creation is but a ray, eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the plenitude of his happineſs and glory, and who will certainly give his children all that their <hi>enlarged</hi> faculties can admit of pleaſure and fruition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Here</hi> we are continually mocked with the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of happineſs, which, on trial, is always found checkered with ill. Here the ſweeteſt odour has attendant briars; the moſt delicious landſcape has its ſhade; the moſt, apparently, finiſhed enjoyment,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:023176_0298_0FBDDE13E83BF510"/>its alloy. Even the ſweet, engaging child and friend, dear to us, as our own ſouls, bring inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable anxieties, and a thouſand unquiet apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for their health, their innocence and peace. Every enviable acquiſition is followed with its trouble; every acceſſion of fortune or intereſt, with its cares; and, in the height of <hi>ſeeming,</hi> wordly bliſs, trouble, ſtill, will find, through various <hi>chinks,</hi> its moments of admiſſion. But, in heaven, all will be unmixed, all will be perfect, all will be ſerene!</p>
                     <p>Such is my private opinion of heaven. Such is the paradiſe of my <hi>imagination.</hi> If it be innocent, I have a right to indulge it; if you think it <hi>viſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> you are at liberty to reject it. If it be an <hi>error,</hi> it is, at leaſt, a pleaſing one; and, if it ſerves to comfort life, or excite us to any laudable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, it has its uſes in ſociety, and muſt, <hi>ultimately,</hi> promote the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>I hope it is true, becauſe time, which diſſolves all earthly things, is ever on the wing, and I wiſh to have my intimacy with <hi>you,</hi> perpetuated through immortality.</p>

We thwart nature, in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inſtances, and, in as many, ſhe retaliates the offence.</p>

                        <pb n="148" facs="unknown:023176_0299_0FBDDE1568A5E240"/>
We almoſt <hi>diſſolve</hi> in hot, carpeted rooms, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of continually expoſing our bodies to the open air. We go to ſleep, when we ſhould be riſing. We invent <hi>artificial</hi> methods of provoking an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, which can only be excited, in a proper manner, by labour and application. And <hi>factitious</hi> amuſements are vainly bidden to create thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which ſhould ariſe from exerciſe and air.</p>
                     <p>This may anſwer a <hi>temporary</hi> purpoſe, but, in the <hi>end,</hi> it would deſtroy the firmeſt conſtitution. It is, in fact, undermining the very ground, upon which we ſtand, and digging a <hi>premature</hi> grave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feet.</p>
                     <p>To me, who follow nature, and am only a ſpectator of the buſtling ſcenes around me, theſe things appear to have ſerious conſequences. When I look at fine, enervated ladies, I tremble, by a ſort of <hi>involuntary</hi> inſtinct, for the riſing generation.</p>
                     <p>What a vigilant, <hi>ſyſtematic</hi> care did the ancient legiſlators beſtow upon this ſex! To give them an healthy, vigorous conſtitution, and to conſult, in <hi>particular ſituations,</hi> their eaſe and cheerfulneſs, was an object not beneath the attention of thoſe heroes, who, by their valour and their talents, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the world.</p>
                     <p>If you intend to have any comfort yourſelf, or be of any ſolid uſefulneſs to others, you muſt be careful of your health. It is a plant, that requires continual nurſing, and without the greateſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will <hi>gradually</hi> die.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not diſſolve on <hi>downy</hi> pillows, till your frame is almoſt thrown into convulſions. You ſhould riſe with the <hi>dawn,</hi> and exerciſe gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the open air, particularly, on horſeback. A little cheerful company will amuſe, and keep your
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:023176_0300_0FBDDE16E82A4D88"/>mind, from preying too much upon itſelf. Too much, on the other hand, will <hi>oppreſs</hi> your ſpirits, and aggravate your complaints.</p>
                     <p>Above all, if you wiſh a removal of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent indiſpoſition, you muſt cautiouſly abſtain from tea, particularly in mornings. However agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this beverage may be, it is, doubtleſs, the ſource of weak nerves, hyſterical and hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac affections, and of half thoſe dreadful, <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytic</hi> ſymptoms, which have lately become ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and alarming.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of <hi>languiſhing</hi> in elegant rooms, you ſhould frequently be ſtrolling into the fields or garden, if you would avoid the bitter draught of an apothecary, or innocently rob the phyſician of his fee. Your <hi>diet</hi> ſhould be ſimple and moderate, confined to one diſh, and that rather animal, than vegetable. You ſhould eat ſparingly, but <hi>often,</hi> and <q>uſe a little wine for your ſtomach's ſake, and your, often, infirmities.</q> The town has, doubtleſs, contributed to your diſorder. When you return into the country, its pure air, I truſt, and tranquil ſcenes will conſiderably reſtore you. Nature never intended ſuch multitudes of people to be crowded together, and breathe the infinite, noxious effluvia of great cities. They are, in fact, the graves of mankind. We may <hi>exiſt</hi> in them for a time; but it is only in the country, that health has any thing of its natural vigour, or life, of its enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>Do not <hi>tamper</hi> with your conſtitution. The whole power of medicine, in <hi>your</hi> caſe, does not afford the ſhadow of relief. Diſorders of this kind baffle all the penetration of the medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

They carry their private burdens, along with them, over hills and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and, when they have exhauſted the
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:023176_0302_0FBDDE19E86BF620"/>whole circle of pleaſures, ſtill there is a great void in the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>I was once, for five weeks at Bath, and recollect it with a mixture of gratitude and pleaſure. It was particularly ſerviceable to my health; and, on the whole, made impreſſions on my mind, that will never be eraſed.</p>
                     <p>The very <hi>ride</hi> to this place wil amazingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive you. Worceſterſhire, at this ſeaſon of the year, is one grand magnificent garden, whoſe air is perfume, whoſe ſcenery is bloſſoms, and whoſe walls are the ſpacious canopy of heaven. If you make Briſtol in your way, I dare promiſe, that your curioſity will be amply gratified by a ſight of that ancient and extenſive city. Though the place, <hi>in itſelf,</hi> is low and dirty, yet the adjacent country is, perhaps, the moſt pictureſque and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in Britain. Clifton Hill is deliciouſly ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic; on one ſide commanding a full proſpect of the city, and looking, on the other, towards that magnificent ocean, which brings the inhabitants all their merchandize and riches. At the foot of this eminence, you will deſcry the medicinal ſpring of the hot-wells, ſo celebrated for their efficacy in <hi>conſumptive</hi> caſes. Here you will be ſhocked with a number of walking <hi>ſkeletons,</hi> who are yellow with ſickneſs, dying of conſumptions, and breathing in their ſighs, the emptineſs and vanity of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man things. Thus is no human pleaſure to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed; and thus are thorns to be intwined with the roſe.</p>
                     <p>King's Weſton Hill, in the environs of this place, has lately been celebrated by a poet. But the copy comes not up to the original. Nature has painted better, than the bard. It is viſited by
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:023176_0303_0FBDDE1B688B93E0"/>all ſtrangers not only for its <hi>own,</hi> magnificent beauties, and wonderful ſcenery, but as an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of beholding the ſea, which here opens, all at once, in a grand and unexpected expanſion, on the aſtoniſhed eye. If you are fortunate enough to have a fine day, you cannot behold a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime or ſtriking curioſity.</p>
                     <p>When you arrive at your journey's end, every thing will deſight you. Regular ſtreets, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent buildings, ſumptuous public rooms, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpects, walls, hills, vallies, fountains, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, company, amuſements—all will proclaim, that you are at Bath. You will feel, that this is the <hi>paradiſe</hi> of Britain; and that the goddeſs of health has <hi>here,</hi> more particularly, fixed her abode. The mind, it is true, carries its ſecret burdens with it, into every ſituation; but I know no place more calculated to efface melancholy impreſſions, or do away tho bad effects of over exertion. The waters are a wonderful cordial to the ſtomach, and a powerful remover of that indigeſtion, which, to the ſtudious and the fair of <hi>ſedentary</hi> lives, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo very general a complaint; and the mind inſenſibly, loſes its little, <hi>fanciful</hi> burdens in the <hi>general</hi> gaiety and ſprightlineſs of the ſcene.— There are, it muſt be confeſſed, many <hi>invalids;</hi> but there are, likewiſe, multitudes of young people of both ſexes, whoſe manners are very highly engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and whoſe faces wear a perpetual ſmile.</p>

                        </gap>ricteſt order and decorum; and in the charms and ſplendour of a ball, as it is managed <hi>here,</hi> one would be led to fancy, that life was wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of pleaſure, if it did not occur, that all this
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:023176_0304_0FBDDE1CE7CF19E0"/>brilliant throng have their private vexations, and the heart its own bitterneſs <hi>within.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Abbey church pleaſes <hi>me</hi> more, than almoſt any ſacred edifice, I have ſeen in the kingdom.— It has not the grandeur and <hi>magnificence</hi> of ſome others, but it is more calculated for uſe, and yields to none in elegance and neatneſs.</p>
                     <p>Lady H—'s chapel is viſited by all ſtrangers, as an elegant curioſity of the ſolemn kind, more perhaps, from the melody and ſweetneſs of the ſinging, than motives of devotion. The good woman, probably founded it in this boſom of pleaſure, with a view of calling ſinners of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to repentance. Her intention was amiable; and her piety, though grounded on the narrow and intolerant principles of Calvin, is entitled to reſpect. When people openly give their-money, zeal, talents and labour to <hi>any</hi> cauſe, we may truſt their <hi>ſincerity.</hi> Nor ſhould criticiſm expoſe the little <hi>involuntary</hi> errors of thoſe, who ſcrupulouſly act up to the dictates of their conſcience, and have thus literally, "left all and followed Chriſt."</p>
                     <p>Lady H—, it is ſaid, has much injured her private fortune by her religious generoſity; in building chapels, ſupporting preachers, and many other public, and private donations. Prudence, ſurely did not warrant ſo extravagant a ſacrifice. But it is not neceſſary to expoſe a conduct, which ſo ſew will ever be diſpoſed to imitate. <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs</hi> is not, by any means, the ſin of <hi>this</hi> age.</p>
                     <p>I was indeed, not a little diſguſted with the preacher of the evening, on which I happened to be at her ladyſhip's chapel. His diſcourſe was a <hi>violent,</hi> inflammatory harangue without elegance, reaſoning or connexion; and conſiſted, for the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:023176_0305_0FBDDE1E688CA168"/>greater part, of a ſevere abuſe of the eſtabliſhed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>gy. We <hi>are,</hi> perhaps, <hi>too</hi> languid and remiſs in the diſcharge of our duty; but to expoſe with <hi>virulence</hi> and rancour, is not ſurely the method to <hi>reform</hi> us. Declamation or ſatire irritates. It is ſolid argument alone, mixed with love and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſoften and converts.</p>
                     <p>Theſe people have not the <hi>gracefulneſs</hi> of piety. They diſplay not in their looks or manner, or <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> the "beauty of holineſs." A ſevere critic, perhaps, would accuſe them of ſpiritual pride, and give them this motto, <q>Stand from me, for I am holier than thou.</q> Their preachers appear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in general knowledge. They do not ſtudy force of argument or embelliſhments of ſtyle.— They are not, indeed, without zeal; but it is wild, extravagant and frantic. They do not ſeem <q>pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iful or courteous, or to be poſſeſſed of that char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which thinke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The Avon, which runs through this city, filled me with great ideas. Shakeſpeare, Stratford, the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:023176_0306_0FBDDE1FE6E4C980"/>Jubilee, immortal talents and immortal fame ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into my mind, as often as I ſaw its ſoft, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtream roll ſilently along.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould wiſh you to take a view of Prior Park, as a place which has ſo long been ſacred to ſcience and the muſes. The late Mr. Allen was the Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas of his times. You cannot tread the ground about it, without recollecting many of thoſe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated wits, who were often invited to this hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table retreat, and entertained its poſſeſſor with all that luxury of taſte and luſcious flow of ſoul which genius inſpires.</p>
                     <p>A great character ſtamps an immortality on the places he frequents, or the houſes he inhabits.— Prior Park will be remembered, when its elegance is mouldered. <hi>Fancy</hi> will plant a laurel round this manſion of taſte, which will continue to be green when the manſion itſelf ſhall have crumbled into atoms.</p>
                     <p>You will much oblige me by a frequency of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whilſt you are at Bath. They will improve your own talent at the <hi>deſcriptive.</hi> To me they will give a more lively recollection of pleaſures, which I once enjoyed. They will retrace upon my mind, agreeable ſcenes and images, which I have, <hi>formerly,</hi> beheld. They will intereſt an heart, that always vibrates to <hi>your</hi> pleaſures or your pains. They will relieve ſpirits that are too much oppreſſed by a variety of thoughts. <hi>Whilſt</hi> I read them, I ſhall forget, that I had ever a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or that I ever was unhappy.</p>
