            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE following Letters have long lain by the author in a ≈øtate of neglect; indeed of uncertainty whether the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them would do any credit to him≈øelf, or ≈øervice to the world. Nor does he think, that he ≈øhould ever have pre≈øumed to expo≈øe them before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable tribunal of the public, unle≈øs animated by the name of the very exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and amiable per≈øonage, to whom they are addre≈ø≈øed.</p>
                  <p>If they de≈øerve no fame, they ought, however, in his opinion, to be branded with no malignant or invidious cen≈øure, as their intention is really to ≈øerve the faire≈øt and mo≈øt amiable part of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; to rou≈øe young ladies from a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant or in≈øipid life, into one of u≈øefulne≈øs, and laudable exertion‚Äîto recall them

                  <p>THE encouragement of every thing virtuous and laudable has been a di≈øtingui≈øhing character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtic of your reign; and if licentiou≈øne≈øs and vice have infe≈øted the kingdom, it is not becau≈øe they have received any countenance from your ≈øove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign authority, or even wanted its mo≈øt ≈øalutary re≈øtraints and pointed oppo≈øition.</p>
                  <p>To your own ≈øex, in particular, you have exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited a mo≈øt in≈øtructive and animating example.‚Äî You have taught them by a ≈øilent, but impre≈ø≈øive

                  <p>In an age, when artificial gaieties have almo≈øt bani≈øhed the ≈øweeter plea≈øures of ≈øimplicity and nature you have di≈øplayed as great a fondne≈øs, as the nece≈ø≈øary avocations of royalty would permit, for dome≈øtic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Your royal brea≈øt has appeared to vibrate with a more exqui≈øite delight, to the care≈ø≈øes of a tender offspring, in the ≈øhades of Wind≈øor, than it ever received from crowded levees, or the ≈øuperb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt brilliance of a court.</p>
                  <p>In a period of fal≈øe refinement, when conjugal fidelity has not appeared a favourite virtue, your Maje≈øty has been a model of as delicate an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ever graced the pure≈øt ages of antiquity, or occurs in the voluminous annals of the world. And in an era of fa≈øtidious affluence, when Cri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity has been undermined by the ≈øubtilty of ≈øcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ≈øtill more di≈øgraced by the lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and irregularities of its profe≈ø≈øors; when its grand bulwark, the chri≈øtian ≈øabbath, has been dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly attacked, particularly among≈øt the higher ranks of people, by many kinds of licentious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu≈øement, you have done every thing in co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with our beloved Monarch, to ≈øtop the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs of the evil, that could re≈øult from virtuous precepts, or the un≈øullied lu≈øtre of example.</p>

Amid≈øt this <hi>general</hi> a≈ø≈øemblage of virtues, there is one point, however, in which your Maje≈øty's character ≈øhines forth with <hi>peculiar</hi> lu≈øtre, and will command the grateful veneration of the mo≈øt di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant po≈øterity. It is that, which is particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced in this work, and ≈øo clo≈øely interwoven with the mo≈øt e≈ø≈øential intere≈øt of ≈øociety‚Äîfemale education. This, your Maje≈øty is allowed to have ≈øtudied with greater earne≈øtne≈øs than any woman throughout your domi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your royal daughters are a daily <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> comment on the excellence of your in≈øtructions, and are infinitely more celebrated for the graces of their hearts, the elegance of their manners, and the improvement of their under≈øtanding, than the magnificence of their family, or the ≈øplendour of their birth.</p>
                  <p>I cannot, therefore, but be deeply ≈øen≈øible of the high honour, that was conferred on me, when your Maje≈øty conde≈øcended to look into this work in manu≈øcript, and give me the unre≈øerved privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of in≈øcribing it to your protection; and I would take a re≈øpectful leave of your Maje≈øty with uttering an earne≈øt wi≈øh, which, elevated as you are, mu≈øt come near the heart‚Äîthat the daughters you have cultivated with ≈øuch a tender a≈ø≈øiduity, may long continue (what they <hi>are,</hi>) the ornament of their ≈øex‚Äîof their kingdom‚Äîof Europe‚Äîthe prop, when ≈øhe wants it, of their declining parent; your con≈øolers in that awful moment, when even Maje≈øty mu≈øt be du≈øt, and your companions in that heaven, where the virtues will remain, though ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and greatne≈øs and di≈øtinctions are forgotten!</p>

You have, doubtle≈øs, con≈øidered who it is, that has deprived you of this invaluable parent; a God of infinite wi≈ødom, who never ≈øtrikes, but at the ≈øitte≈øt moment; a God of equal goodne≈øs, who without the ≈øtronge≈øt rea≈øons, would not afflict,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:023176_0011_0FBDE297AF216248"/>and a being of unbounded power, who is abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly able to make up your lo≈øs, and open to you a thou≈øand ≈øources of comfort.</p>
                     <p>Chri≈øtianity ≈øhould exclude all <hi>unrea≈øonable</hi> ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. If we believe that our friends are dead in God; we know that this life is only a vapour; that our ≈øeparation is but for a moment, and that we ≈øhall ≈øoon be re≈øtored to them in a world, where life is without pain, and where friend≈øhip is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</p>
                     <p>Though you are, in the <hi>literal</hi> ≈øen≈øe, an orphan, yet the number of friends, to whom you are ≈øo ju≈øtly dear, will render your ≈øituation neither ≈øoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, nor defencele≈øs. The ≈øen≈øible, the elegant and the good will think them≈øelves honoured by your acquaintance. They will give you credit for inheriting all the amiable qualities of a mother, who was revered, as far as known, whil≈øt nature has ≈øo ≈øtrongly imprinted, on your face, the re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of her features.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øcene is ≈øtill fre≈øh upon my memory, when, in her la≈øt moments, ≈øhe ≈øo ≈øtrongly recommended you to my protection. And though ≈øhe paid a compliment to my abilities, which only a partial friend≈øhip could have excited, ≈øhe did nothing more than ≈øtrict ju≈øtice to the warmth of my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ≈øhall really think my≈øelf complimented by your corre≈øpondence. If you will call me father or brother, you will give an unu≈øual lu≈øtre to my name. This fond heart ≈øhall vibrate to your wi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and your happine≈øs: and, if you will occa≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vi≈øit my little cot, it ≈øhall put on all its lovelie≈øt charms, and ≈ømile in all its gaye≈øt attire, to receive ≈øo dear and ≈øo amiable a ≈øtranger.

                     <p>We ≈øhall reap, I am a≈ø≈øured, <hi>mutual</hi> benefits by this acquaintance. If I am able to communicate to you any little knowledge, you will more than repay it by that ea≈øe, delicacy, refinement, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and expan≈øion, which the mind never effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually feels, but in the friend≈øhip of a ≈øen≈øible and an intere≈øting woman. Such a friend≈øhip is the riche≈øt cordial of life. Either of the ≈øexes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, are never what they ≈øhould be. Like the be≈øt figures, <hi>mutilated,</hi> they appear to di≈øadvantage. Unnatural expedients may be tried to ≈øupply its place. Bu≈øine≈øs, ambition, an <hi>over-≈øtrained</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or peculiar ≈øituations may lead us to deny our≈øelves ≈øo ≈øweet a plea≈øure; but, in fact, all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man projects and ≈øucce≈ø≈øes are <hi>in≈øipid</hi> without it. They are ro≈øele≈øs thorns, a winter without a ≈øpring. Plea≈øures have not their reli≈øh, and ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row wants a bo≈øom to recline on. Our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have not their proper ≈øoftne≈øs; our morals their purity, and our ≈øouls feel an uncomfortable void.</p>
                     <p>They, who talk degradingly of women, do not know the value of the trea≈øure they de≈øpi≈øe. They have not ≈øufficient ta≈øte to reli≈øh their excellencies, or purity enough to court their acquaintance. They have taken the portrait of <hi>abandoned</hi> women, and they think the features applicable to all.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øofter ≈øex, it is certain, are exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by their education.

                     <p>It is true there is <hi>evil</hi> in the world, as well as good; there are marks of <hi>judgment,</hi> as well as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023176_0024_0FBDE2AB2DFBFCE8"/>whether it was proper for the Almighty to create ≈øuch a world at all? Had we not better re≈øerve the propriety of this conduct to be di≈øputed with him, at his great tribunal? <hi>There,</hi> I doubt not, we ≈øhall be amply convinced, that the creation was a work of infinite <hi>mercy,</hi> as well as power, and that a greater degree of <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> than mi≈øery has ari≈øen from it. There too, when we are able to di≈øcern with <hi>glorified</hi> eyes, the whole chain of cau≈øes and effects, from the beginning, to the end, of time; the dependence of one link of being on another, and of worlds, on worlds; this evil we now complain of, may become a means of exalting our ideas of the attributes of the Almighty; and we ≈øhall blu≈øh at our≈øelves for even having que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his goodne≈øs for a moment, or encouraged a rea≈øoning pride, ≈øo ill becoming creatures, who≈øe days are few, who≈øe ≈øtrength is weakne≈øs, who≈øe wi≈ødom folly; and who, in the pre≈øent <hi>immure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of their under≈øtanding, ≈øcarcely know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a blade of gra≈øs, or of the very pebbles, on which they tread.</p>
                     <p>This que≈øtion concerning the <hi>origin</hi> of evil has puzzled the whole tribe of rea≈øoners and philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, from the creation, to the pre≈øent moment.

This deranged ≈øtate of things is the providential puni≈øhment of guilt, but at the ≈øame time, contrived in mercy, as a ≈øalutary regimen, and as a mode of purifying fallen creatures for the innocence and happine≈øs of a better world. It is a <hi>chao;,</hi> fitted to our <hi>pre≈øent</hi> con≈øtitution, and will refine, as <hi>we</hi> do, into its primitive beauty and ≈øplendour. <q>There ≈øhall then be new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.

                     <p>DEVOTION, con≈øidered ≈øimply in it≈øelf, is an intercour≈øe betwixt us and God; betwixt the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023176_0026_0FBDE2AE5D630A70"/>≈øelf-exi≈øtent, inconceivable ≈øpirit, which formed and pre≈øerves the univer≈øe, and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ≈øpirit, with which, for awful rea≈øons, he has animated a portion of <hi>matter</hi> upon earth, that we call man. It is a ≈øilent act, in which the ≈øoul dive≈øts it≈øelf of <hi>outward</hi> things, flies into heaven, and pours forth all its wants, wi≈øhes, hopes, fears, guilt or plea≈øures, into the bo≈øom of an <hi>almighty</hi> friend.</p>
                     <p>Though this devotion, in its fir≈øt ≈øtages, may be a weari≈øome or <hi>in≈øipid</hi> exerci≈øe, yet this ari≈øes mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the depravity of nature, and of our pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions. A little <hi>habit</hi> will overcome this reluctance. When you have fairly entered on your journey, <q>the ways of this wi≈ødom will be ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øantne≈øs, and all its paths, peace.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>True devotion, doubtle≈øs, requires a con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of <hi>ab≈øtraction</hi> from the world. Hence <hi>modern</hi> chri≈øtians treat it, as a <hi>vi≈øion.</hi> Hence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>modern</hi> writers have little of its unction. But it glows in the ≈øcriptures. It warms us in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It burned in an Au≈øtin, and in many other of tho≈øe per≈øecuted martyrs, who now are with God.</p>
                     <p>That we <hi>hear</hi> little of it, is not wonderful. It makes no noi≈øe in the circles of the learned or of the elegant. Under an heap of worldly cares, we <hi>≈ømother</hi> the lovely infant, and will not let it breathe. Vanity, ambition, plea≈øure, avarice, quench the cele≈øtial fire. And the≈øe alas! are too much the god of <hi>mortals!</hi> Ever ≈øince the world began, writers have been amu≈øing us only with <hi>≈øhadows</hi> of this piety, in≈øtead of giving us its <hi>≈øoul</hi> and <hi>≈øub≈øtance.</hi> Super≈øtition has placed it in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ceremonies, au≈øterities, pilgrimages, <hi>per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:023176_0027_0FBDE2AFB01DA468"/>an augu≈øt temple, or ≈øplendid imagery, which had little connexion with ≈øentiment or ≈øpirit. Enthu≈øia≈øm has ≈øwelled with <hi>unnatural</hi> conceptions, and obtruded a <hi>≈øpurious</hi> offspring on the world, in≈øtead of this engaging child of rea≈øon and truth; whil≈øt the lukewarm have re≈øted in a few out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties, which have had no vigour, and, as they ≈øprung not from the heart, never entered the temple of the mo≈øt High.</p>
                     <p>Real piety is of a very different, and of a much more <hi>animated,</hi> nature. It looks up to God, ≈øees, hears, feels him, in every event, in every vici≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in all places, in all ≈øea≈øons, and upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions. It is theory, vivified by experience. It is faith, <hi>≈øub≈øtantiated</hi> by <hi>mental</hi> enjoyment. It is heaven, tran≈øplanted into the human bo≈øom. It is the radiance of the Divinity, warming and incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling man. It is <hi>≈øpiritual</hi> ≈øen≈øe, gratified by <hi>≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> ≈øen≈øations. Without <hi>this,</hi> all <hi>ceremonies</hi> are inefficacious. Books, prayers, ≈øacraments and meditations are but a body, without a ≈øoul, or a ≈øtatue, without animation.</p>
                     <p>That man is <hi>capable</hi> of ≈øuch an intercour≈øe with his maker, there are many <hi>living</hi> witne≈ø≈øes to prove. Without having recour≈øe to the vi≈øions of fanatics, or the dreams of enthu≈øia≈øts, it may be proved to ≈øpring from natural and <hi>philo≈øophical</hi> cau≈øes. God is a ≈øpirit; ≈øo is the mind. <hi>Bodies</hi> can have intercour≈øe; ≈øo can <hi>≈øouls.</hi> When minds are in an <hi>a≈ø≈øimilating</hi> ≈øtate of purity, they have union with their Maker. This was the bli≈øs of <hi>paradi≈øe;</hi> ≈øin interrupted, and holine≈øs mu≈øt re≈øtore it. To a ≈øoul, thus di≈øpo≈øed, the creator commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates him≈øelf, in a manner, which is as in≈øen≈øible to the natural eye, as the falling of dews, but not
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023176_0028_0FBDE2B12DFA1C70"/>le≈øs refre≈øhing to its ≈øecret powers, than <hi>that</hi> is to vegetation.</p>
                     <p>The primitive ≈øaints are de≈øcribing this, when they ≈øpeak of their tran≈øports. David felt it, when he longed for God, as the heart panteth after the water brooks. St. Paul knew it, when he gloried in his tribulations. It was <hi>embodied</hi> in him, when he was carried up into the third heavens, and heard things, impo≈ø≈øible to be uttered. St. Stephen was filled with it, when he ≈øaw the heavens open, and prayed for his murderers. By it, martyrs were ≈øupported, when they were ≈øtoned, and ≈øawn a≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And till we feel it in <hi>our≈øelves,</hi> we ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fully know, how gracious the Lord is.</p>
                     <p>If you can acquire this ≈øpiritual <hi>ab≈øtraction,</hi> you will, at once, have made your fortune for eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It will be of little moment, what is your lot on earth, or what the di≈øtingui≈øhing vici≈ø≈øitudes of your life. Pro≈øperity or adver≈øity, health or ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, honor or di≈øgrace, a cottage or a crown, will all be ≈øo many in≈øtruments of glory. The whole creation will become a <hi>temple.</hi> Every event and every object will lead your mind to God, and in his greatne≈øs and perfections, you will in≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lo≈øe the littlene≈øs, the glare and tin≈øel of all human things.</p>
                     <p>If I wi≈øhed only to ≈øet off your <hi>per≈øon</hi> to the greate≈øt advantage, I would recommend this true <hi>≈øublime</hi> of religion. It gives a plea≈øing ≈øerenity to the countenance, and a cheerfulne≈øs to the ≈øpirits beyond the reach of art, or the power of affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It communicates a real tran≈øport to the mind, which di≈ø≈øipation mimics only for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a ≈øweetne≈øs to the di≈øpo≈øition, and a <hi>lu≈øtre</hi> to the manners, which all the airs of modern po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litene≈øs

                     <p>Public wor≈øhip and the ≈øacraments are the grand <hi>outwork</hi> of piety. They are the <hi>doors,</hi> by which we enter the ≈øanctuary of God. They are the channels for conveying heavenly grace and vigour to the ≈øoul. It is here the Redeemer gives us food, that nouri≈øhes to eternal life. It is here he rains down fountaine of living water.</p>

                     <p>ANOTHER excellent method of inkindling piety, is <hi>reading the ≈øcriptures.</hi> A chri≈øtian, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ≈øhould have this ≈øacred book, ever folded in his brea≈øt. There is a richne≈øs and a comfort in it, that nothing el≈øe can equal. Every word is big with in≈øtruction; every ≈øentence is divine. It is a mine, perpetually opening; the deeper we
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023176_0031_0FBDE2B5B049C930"/>dig, the richer is the ore. It is a fea≈øt, adapted to <hi>every</hi> ta≈øte; the mo≈øt exalted under≈øtanding mu≈øt admire, and the <hi>lowe≈øt</hi> cannot fail to comprehend, its in≈øtructions.</p>
                     <p>If people only read for the ≈øake of <hi>entertainment,</hi> where can they find a book equal to the Bible? What other production, either ancient or modern, has ≈øuch ≈øtriking pa≈ø≈øages of the pathetic and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, the vehement and impa≈ø≈øioned? Where are there ≈øuch lofty images, ≈øuch grand conceptions, or ≈øuch picture≈øque and animated de≈øcriptions, as in the p≈øalms? There is ≈øcarcely a per≈øon in the world, to who≈øe ca≈øe ≈øome of them are not adapted, nor a ≈øorrow which they cannot ≈øooth. In one part, plaintive, affecting, penitential; in another full of triumph and exultation, ennobling elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; here de≈øcribing the immen≈øity, maje≈øty, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence and omnipre≈øence of God; there the littlene≈øs of the world, and the vanity of man; whoever can read them without emotion, mu≈øt be pronounced void both of piety and ta≈øte.</p>
                     <p>The prophets are the true <hi>≈øublime</hi> of holy reading. The bold images, metaphors, allu≈øions and de≈øcriptions, with which they abound, have been the admiration of the mo≈øt accompli≈øhed ≈øcholars, orators and critics in the world. The proverbs of Solomon and the book of Eccle≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øticus are an excellent ≈øy≈øtem for the government of private life, as well as a fund of ≈øpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction! They have all the <hi>marrow</hi> of our <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> ≈øy≈øtems of good breeding, without any of their <hi>poi≈øon.</hi> The ≈øacred ≈øtories of the ≈øcripture are related with amazing ≈øimplicity and pathos; the parables are beautifully pointed and in≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and the epi≈øtles of St. Paul are a model
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023176_0032_0FBDE2B73582B718"/>of the ≈øublime≈øt and mo≈øt energetic eloquence, that can be found in any age, or in any language.</p>
                     <p>When the immortal Locke and Newton had dived into every <hi>other</hi> kind of knowledge, they ≈øat down to contemplate the vanity and poverty of all, in the richne≈øs of the ≈øcriptures. The famous Bacon, an oracle of learning, in his day, and the wonder of all ≈øucceeding ages, confe≈ø≈øed them to be the ≈øource of all <hi>real wi≈ødom.</hi> The il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øtrious Selden, on his death-bed, a≈ø≈øured arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øhop U≈øher, that the <hi>whole</hi> of his immen≈øe library could not give him half the comfort, which he derived from one <hi>≈øingle</hi> ≈øentence of the in≈øpired writings; and Addi≈øon, who≈øe name mu≈øt be ever dear to every friend of religion and virtue, ≈øpent no little time in collecting together, and arranging into one common point of view, the united evidences of the chri≈øtian religion.</p>
                     <p>The primitive chri≈øtians u≈øed to read this book, on their knees. Their preface was, <q>Open thou mine eyes, that I may ≈øee the wondrous things of thy law.</q> Imitate them on earth, and in <hi>time</hi> you ≈øhall join that illu≈øtrious choir of ≈øaints, that are continually wor≈øhipping before the throne in heaven.</p>

                     <p>THE old Scriptures may appear, in them≈øelves, dry and in≈øipid; but when you con≈øider them, as <hi>typical</hi> of the new, and affording a ≈øtrong, colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023176_0033_0FBDE2B8AE0BA0D0"/>te≈øtimony to the truth of revelation; as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribing the circum≈øtances, manners, and anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes of a peculiar, cho≈øen people, who≈øe hi≈øtory, rebellion, captivity and di≈øper≈øion are interwoven with the whole ≈øy≈øtem of chri≈øtianity, you will read them with a greater reli≈øh, and more godly edification.</p>
                     <p>Je≈øus Chri≈øt is the foundation of the apo≈øtles and prophets; all the incidents you read, point to him, as their origin, and as their end; <q>the great corner ≈øtone in Zion; the lamb ≈ølain from the foundation of the world.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The bondage of the children of I≈ørael in Egypt, is an image of <hi>our</hi> captivity to ≈øin and their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, of our redemption through the blood of Chri≈øt; their journeying through the wilderne≈øs, is a ≈øtrong picture of our weari≈øome pa≈ø≈øage through this vale of tears. Mo≈øes is the Saviour, making waters of comfort gu≈øh from the ≈øtony rock; the manna is the food of his word, and the waters are the graces of his holy ≈øpirit; the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and affecting hi≈øtory of Jo≈øeph is an emblem of that better per≈øonage, who was envied, hated, per≈øecuted and murdered by his brethren, for the general ≈øalvation: Abraham is a ≈øtriking image of the Almighty, offering up his only ≈øon, and all the <hi>ceremonies</hi> of the law point to that true <hi>blood</hi> of ≈øprinkling, which alone can take away the ≈øins of the world. Thus is <hi>every</hi> page holy; thus do you tread, every moment, on con≈øecrated ground, and thus every word, when <hi>properly</hi> under≈øtood, is ≈øpirit and is life.</p>
                     <p>But of <hi>all</hi> the ≈øcriptures, the go≈øpels are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the mo≈øt edifying and in≈øtructive. They are plain, forcible, ≈øpiritual; they come from the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023176_0034_0FBDE2BA2F5C92A0"/>very mouth of holine≈øs and wi≈ødom, and do not admit of any wrong con≈øtructions or doubtful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations. If there was only the fifth chapter of St. Matthew's go≈øpel extant, we ≈øhould have an incomparable abridgement of chri≈øtianity, ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to direct our faith, to animate our practice, and fla≈øh confu≈øion on that ho≈øt of writers, who have built ≈øo many ≈øtrong and dangerous opinions on the pretended ba≈øis of revelation.</p>
                     <p>Commentators may ≈øerve to explain an ea≈øtern cu≈øtom, ceremony, allu≈øion or mode of expre≈ø≈øion, but I cannot in general, recommend them, at lea≈øt to young people. They embarra≈øs more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than they direct; they have often perplexed, what, in it≈øelf, was clear, and darkened, where they affected to illuminate. The ≈øayings of our Lord are ≈øo very obvious, as to need little or no explanation. They are a precious wine, which the profane wi≈ødom of ≈øcholars and philo≈øophers has mixed with water. If men had only ≈øtudied them with earne≈øtne≈øs, in≈øtead of their own intere≈øts, prejudices and pa≈ø≈øions, we ≈øhould never have been di≈øtracted with ≈øo many ≈øy≈øtems of error and ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtition.</p>
                     <p>Do not read much, at a time. Meditation is the ≈øtomach, which dige≈øts this food; you ≈øhould <hi>reflect</hi> many hours, for reading <hi>one.</hi> And there is ≈øuch a conden≈øed richne≈øs in the ≈øcriptures, that one ≈øingle ver≈øe will often ≈øugge≈øt an ample fund for ≈øerious contemplation.</p>
                     <p>Every moment, that you peru≈øe this book, con≈øider your≈øelf as in the immediate pre≈øence of your Maker. Fancy that you heard him, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the commandments, in all the thunder and lightning of the mount. Remember that, though
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023176_0035_0FBDE2BBAF9C2028"/>heaven and earth fail, one jot or one tittle ≈øhall, in no wi≈øe, pa≈øs from the law, till all be fulfilled. Con≈øider what a number of holy men have ≈øealed the truth of this te≈øtimony with their blood. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your≈øelf by the promi≈øes and threatenings, as you go along, and do not forget to ble≈øs God, upon your knees, that he has given you ≈øuch a lamp for your feet, and ≈øuch a light to your paths.</p>
                     <p>Without this ≈øacred volume, the world would have been, at this very moment, con≈øiderably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlightened; wor≈øhipping ≈øtocks or ≈øtones, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps offering human blood, and tormenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves with burden≈øome ceremonies, that had no manner of connection with the heart; immer≈øed in ≈øorrows, which they could not have ea≈øed, and perplexed with a thou≈øand, gloomy enigmas, which they never could have ≈øolved. The light, which ≈øuperficial ≈øceptics vaunt, as that of <hi>nature</hi> or phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophy, or, in a great degree, derived from the ≈øcriptures.

                     <p>I ≈øcarcely know a woman, that de≈øerves ≈øo much from the community at large, as Mrs. Trimmer.

                     <p>Without the atonement of Chri≈øt, criminals as we are, there never could have been any hope of mercy; without the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and graces of the ≈øpirit, we could not have been purified for the man≈øions of glory.

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOUR ≈øacred reading needs not to be wholly confined to the ≈øcriptures. A few, other ≈øerious
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023176_0040_0FBDE2C3381DFF50"/>books will a≈ø≈øi≈øt your piety, as well as ≈øerve to <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øtrate</hi> and confirm the ≈øcriptures them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>I cannot, in this re≈øpect, ≈øo much recommend <hi>modern</hi> ≈øermons, as ≈øome little practical treati≈øes of piety. Engli≈øh di≈øcour≈øes in general, by a ftrange, ≈øchola≈øtic mi≈ømanagement, are not ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently addre≈ø≈øed to the <hi>heart.</hi> Either they are learned di≈øqui≈øitions, on ≈øome <hi>≈øpeculative,</hi> contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ≈øubject, more calculated to di≈øplay abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than to edify; or they are ≈øpruce, moral e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øays with little more of <hi>chri≈øtianity</hi> in them, than might be gleaned from the works of Plato or Epic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus. They want that ≈øimplicity, fire, energy, animation, that boldne≈øs of images, appeal to the con≈øcience, and that picture≈øque di≈øplay of heaven and hell, which give ≈øuch an unction to the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of St. Paul, and of the fathers. They do not thunder and lighten at the ≈øinner: they do not carry us by a whirlwind, into heaven, and ≈øhew us thrones and ≈øceptres; they convince, but they do not animate; they <hi>glitter,</hi> but they do not <hi>warm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ancient divines have more fire and matter. They ≈øtudied the ≈øcriptures, more than <hi>human</hi> ≈øy≈øtems. "They were filled with the ≈øpirit;" they were men of watchfulne≈øs and prayers. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ≈øpirit of critici≈øm or of philo≈øophy, fal≈øely ≈øo called, makes <hi>us</hi> cold and languid. In pervading many learned or ≈øplendid pages, the heart is often left devoid of one, pious emotion.</p>
                     <p>Many ≈øermons, no doubt, are to be excepted from this cen≈øure. Tho≈øe of Archbi≈øhop Secker contain a fund of ≈øolid matter, piety and in≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the <hi>≈øtyle</hi> is rather ≈øingular and uncouth. The marble is rich, but it is unpoli≈øhed, There
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023176_0041_0FBDE2C4ACE70690"/>is ≈øuch a thing, as an elegant ≈øimplicity. Seeker had a ≈øimplicity without this elegance.</p>
                     <p>Few prelates, however, have de≈øerved ≈øo well from the church, or po≈øterity. The metropolitan, though placed in the bo≈øom of a court, had neither pride, indolence, nor adulation. His vigilance was extraordinary; his labours unremitting, and his crofier but an imperfect emblem of the real pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral zeal, "which eat up his ≈øoul." The pre≈øent bi≈øhop of London has all the ≈øimplicity of his illu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious patron, ti≈ø≈øued with that elegance, which the archbi≈øhop wanted. His ≈øermous have been <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øally</hi> read; they are written on a truly evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical plan; and their object is not merely to <hi>amu≈øe,</hi> but to in≈øtruct and edify.</p>

                     <p>The doctor ≈øeems particularly to have ≈øtudied conci≈øene≈øs, and his <hi>miniature</hi> plan ≈øometimes leaves the features of his pieces indi≈øtinct.

                     <p>THE late, unfortunate Dr. Dodd owed, I ≈øhould conceive, his great popularity to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his voice, per≈øon, manner, ge≈øture and addre≈øs. For indeed his compo≈øitions have not intrin≈øic merit enough to have challenged any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary applau≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Weak, flim≈øy, ≈øuperficial in his arguments, and rather plau≈øible, than energetic in his language, it mu≈øt have been only the <hi>popularity</hi> of his ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the new vein of <hi>pathetic,</hi> which he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his fortunate congenial ≈øituation at the Magdalen, and in a metropolis, which, under the management of ≈øuch advantages, procured him his exten≈øive, <hi>temporary</hi> reputation.</p>
                     <p>But alas! his popularity was very dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øed! It was built on the ruins of his innocence and virtue. Happy, if he had lived and died in ob≈øcurity, or been an humble curate in ≈øome ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtered village, where je≈ø≈øamines had cla≈øped round his unenvied man≈øion, with unenlightened ru≈øtics only for his a≈ø≈øociates! Admiration would not then have dazzled his eyes. His vanity could not have ≈øought tho≈øe <hi>unequal</hi> connexions, which he afterwards found him≈øelf unable to ≈øupport, nor expen≈øive plea≈øures led him to an action, which wounded religion in its very vitals, and brought ≈øo much di≈øgrace on his ≈øacred profe≈ø≈øion.</p>
                     <p>He might, then, like many other excellent men, have "fallen a≈øleep," amid≈øt the tender offices of bewailing friends; and grateful villagers,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023176_0045_0FBDE2CAADDE66B0"/>would have wetted his monument with tears of heart-felt gratitude and e≈øteem.

                     <p>Born with no ≈ølender ≈øhare of ambition, Young had anxiou≈øly and <hi>un≈øucce≈øsfully</hi> courted promotion.

His poems, therefore, have much the ≈øtrain of elegy, and his piety is breathed in ≈øighs. But his Night Thoughts have awakened many into ≈øeriou≈øne≈øs, and you mu≈øt take them, as you do all <hi>other,</hi> human things, with their good and their bad. The brighte≈øt pearl is ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a mud. It is the bu≈øine≈øs of ta≈øte and judgment to make the ≈øeparation.</p>
                     <p>The works of Wil≈øon (the once bi≈øhop of Sodor and Man,) are a trea≈øure of plain, <hi>practical</hi> devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His Indian in≈øtructed, his <hi>Parochialia,</hi> his <hi>Sacra Privata,</hi> and his treati≈øe on the ≈øacrament, are all ≈øerious and intere≈øting.</p>
                     <p>This good prelate has not di≈øplayed much ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius or learning.

                     <p>THE meditations of St. Au≈øtin are admirable, but have ≈øuffered not a little from the tran≈ølation. It is, I ≈øtill repeat it, in the≈øe <hi>old</hi> books, that we chiefly find the true ≈øpirit of piety. Has it evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, like ≈øome <hi>mineral</hi> waters, by a long pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Or is it that we would be men of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophy and critici≈øm, rather than divines? A <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> theologian plays about the <hi>head,</hi> but ≈øcarcely warms the <hi>heart;</hi> an <hi>ancient</hi> writer carries us, by an irre≈øi≈øtible impul≈øe, into heaven, and fills us with all the raptures of devotion.</p>
                     <p>The difference will be very forcibly illu≈øtrated by the different con≈øtruction of ancient and modern churches. The wide magnificence, the luminous darkne≈øs, the mouldering wells and long drawn aile of gothic ≈øtructures in≈øpire us with a plea≈øing melancholy, thoughtfulne≈øs and devotion; whil≈øt the glaring light, artificial ornaments, primne≈øs and convenience of our <hi>modern</hi> ≈øynagogues fill us only with little, <hi>worldly</hi> ideas of elegance and ta≈øte.</p>
                     <p>Beveridge's private thoughts and re≈øolutions rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øerve a place in your collection. They are not animated or elegant, but they are pious and u≈øeful. He is one of tho≈øe ho≈øpitable friends, that gives us a very comfortable and rich repa≈øt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremony or o≈øtentation.</p>
                     <p>Taylor is the Shake≈øpeare of divinity. The fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of his invention, the force of his arguments, the richne≈øs of his images and the copiou≈øne≈øs of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023176_0053_0FBDE2D72D8F19E8"/>his ≈øtyle are not often to be paralleled in the works of ancient or modern writers. His holy living and dying is a <hi>chef d'oeuvre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do not remember to have received more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure and improvement from any book, that I have read for ≈øome time pa≈øt, than from the two fir≈øt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of Ganganelli's Letters. Be≈øides being ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ≈øee ≈øuch a generous mode of thinking in the ≈øovereign pontiff, ≈øo much vivacity in a <hi>monk,</hi> tempered with ≈øo great a ≈øhare of unaffected piety, I was quite charmed with the ≈øimplicity of his ≈øtyle, the beauty of his metaphors, and that ≈øpirit of philanthropy, which pervades the whole, and does, all along, more honour to his heart, than his ea≈øy periods, to his under≈øtanding.</p>
                     <p>There is ≈øomething in the climate of Italy, which wonderfully heats and ≈øublimes the imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. It is the garden of Europe, and its writers breathe that agreeable perfume with which it is ≈øcented. Ganganelli's de≈øcription of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is particularly ≈øplendid. His ≈øtatues breathe. His torrents ab≈øolutely murmur on the ear. His cliffs have an impending horror on the fancy, and his gardens waft upon us aromatic ≈ømells. I would ≈øtill gladly hope, notwith≈øtanding all that has been advanced to the contrary, that the≈øe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters really came from this di≈øtingui≈øhed per≈øon.

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOU would ob≈øerve from the complexion of my la≈øt letter, that I have recommended writers of very different ≈øects, and from various denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of chri≈øtians. The truth is, I have con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their <hi>≈øpirit</hi> and <hi>tendency,</hi> and not their name or party. I do not want to make you a methodi≈øt, a di≈ø≈øenter, a my≈øtic, a papi≈øt, a fanatic, an enthu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øt, or any thing but a real chri≈øtian. I ≈øhould wi≈øh to dive≈øt your mind of every ≈øpecies of bigotry, and convince you, that real piety <hi>has</hi> exi≈øted under <hi>every</hi> communion.</p>
                     <p>When your judgment is more matured, you ≈øhould examine authors of all different per≈øua≈øions, as the Grecian arti≈øt did women, when he wi≈øhed to paint his Venus of Medici. He ≈øelected from every one he ≈øaw, that <hi>particular</hi> limb or feature, in which they, <hi>≈øeparately,</hi> excelled. From one, he borrowed the mo≈øt beautiful eye; from another, an hand; from a third, a bo≈øom, &amp;c. The≈øe, by a wonderful effort of genius, he combined into a perfect whole.</p>
                     <p>All ≈øy≈øtems, like all human figures, have their defects; but they have, likewi≈øe, their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Collect the≈øe, di≈øtinct charms, and work them up in the crucible of your heart, till they produce "the very beauty of holine≈øs" in your life and conver≈øation.</p>

Above all, look through all books and forms and ordinances, up to your God. Cheri≈øh, by every method, a ≈øpirit of devotion. Set the Lord always before you. Con≈øider him, as the <hi>≈øoul</hi> of the world, the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. Think, act, live, as in his pre≈øence, and do every thing to his glory. Begin, continue and end every day, as in his ≈øight, and every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as under his direction. Remember that all things on earth are but a ≈øhadow; that time is tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling down the ≈øy≈øtem of the univer≈øe, and that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion only</hi> can ri≈øe upon the ruins, by the labours it has in≈øcribed to Eternity and God.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>THOUGH it may appear to be dealing with you in dry, ab≈øtracted ≈øubjects above your age, yet I do think it nece≈ø≈øary, that you ≈øhould under≈øtand the grounds, on which your faith is built, or the te≈øtimony, which confirms the truth of chri≈øtianity, and of the ≈øcriptures. You will thus be pre≈øerved from an uncomfortable fluctuation of opinions, and guarded from the fal≈øe in≈øinuations of tho≈øe, that lie in wait to deceive.</p>
                     <p>I believe, indeed, we very fal≈øely e≈øtimate the period, at which the talents of women begin to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023176_0056_0FBDE2DB2E529CB0"/>open, as well as the degree of their extent and comprehen≈øion, and ≈øuperciliou≈øly withhold from you, that ≈øolid information which, alone in <hi>either</hi> ≈øex, can be the true foundation of a rational, a ≈øteady and con≈øi≈øtent conduct.</p>
                     <p>This re≈øtimony in favour of revelation, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, for the ≈øake of order, into two kinds, <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external.</hi> The internal is that, which ari≈øes from the nature and excellency of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts <hi>them≈øelves,</hi> and from the writers having had no <hi>private</hi> or ≈øini≈øter views to an≈øwer, but con≈øult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the <hi>general</hi> good and edification of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>fir≈øt</hi> mark of authenticity is fixed on every page of the ≈øcriptures. The laws of Chri≈øt are of ≈øuch a nature, as no man would have framed, who wi≈øhed to avail him≈øelf of the pa≈ø≈øions, prejudices and intere≈øts of mankind; for they pre≈øcribe, on the other hand, an univer≈øal humility, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ≈øelf-denial; exhibit, in the ≈øtronge≈øt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, the emptine≈øs of riches, and the vanity of ambition, and have no other view, but to elevate the affections, regenerate the heart, and put all men on looking beyond the tran≈øient concerns of this life, to the happine≈øs of another. What el≈øe could happen to the original promulgers of the≈øe laws, but that, which <hi>actually</hi> did, violence and per≈øecution?</p>
                     <p>Our ble≈ø≈øed Lord po≈øitively declared, that his kingdom was not of this world. He ≈øought none of its di≈øtinctions, and he feceived none, unle≈øs, by a ≈øtrange perver≈øion of ideas, we place them in the poverty of a manger, or the tortures of his cro≈øs. His <hi>apo≈øtles</hi> were inflamed with the very ≈øame, <hi>di≈øintere≈øted</hi> zeal. They willingly re≈øigned
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023176_0057_0FBDE2DCAE13BEF0"/>lucrative employments at the call of their ma≈øter; they cheerfully abandoned weeping friends; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the mo≈øt hazardous voyages and travels; had no re≈øt day or night, were carried before kings and governors of the earth, "and even hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all men for his name's ≈øake."</p>
                     <p>Read the account of their labours, per≈øecution, bani≈øhment, death; peru≈øe the hi≈øtory of all the martyrs, written with their blood, and tell me, whether their zeal mu≈øt not have come from <hi>heaven,</hi> or what could ever have in≈øpired it, but a ≈øincere conviction of duty, "a faith, which looked to a city with foundations, who≈øe builder and maker was God."</p>

                     <p>THINK, my dear girl, for your≈øelf. Are there any marks of ≈øecular wi≈ødom or policy or impo≈øture, in the conduct of the primitive apo≈øtles and chri≈øtians?

                     <p>The Roman Emperor in≈øtituted a ≈øacred code to work upon the con≈øciences, and to keep the minds of a ≈øavage and a barbarous people in ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to <hi>government.</hi> Zoroa≈øter, Lycurgus, Solon, all celebrated in their day, and certainly
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023176_0058_0FBDE2DE2F285F58"/>men of extraordinary talents, had more a view to <hi>policy,</hi> than any <hi>moral</hi> intere≈øts, in their re≈øpective ≈øy≈øtems of legi≈ølation.

                     <p>
                        <q>The kingdom of all <hi>the≈øe</hi> men was certainly of <hi>this</hi> world,</q> and their laws, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, were repugnant to right rea≈øon, and the be≈øt and deare≈øt intere≈øts of their fellow creatures. Of Chri≈øt, his very <hi>enemies</hi> ≈øaid, "never man ≈øpake, like this man;" his injunctions had but <hi>one</hi> a≈øpect‚Äîto <hi>univer≈øul</hi> happine≈øs, and one, ≈øimple method to it‚Äîuniver≈øal <hi>reformation.</hi> The angels that announced him, at his fir≈øt appearance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed "peace on earth, and good-will towards men."</p>
                     <p>Nor is the wonderful <hi>progre≈øs</hi> of this religion, in ≈øo <hi>≈øhort</hi> a ≈øpace of time, over all A≈øia, and a great part of Europe, indeed over almo≈øt the <hi>whole</hi> of the, <hi>then,</hi> known world, the lea≈øt convincing proof of its divine original. Con≈øider the <hi>mi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries</hi>‚Äîilliterate fi≈øhermen and mechanics, and you mu≈øt conclude, either that they were endowed with <hi>≈øupernatural</hi> gifts and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, or that their wonderful <hi>≈øucce≈øs</hi> was even a greater <hi>miracle,</hi> than the endowment, you di≈øpute.</p>
                     <p>On this ≈øubject, permit me to recommend to your ≈øerious peru≈øal, Soame Jenyn's Internal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Chri≈øtian Religion. He is, on the whole, a fanciful writer; but this is an excellent, little book, that has done much good, and comes with greater force, to every bo≈øom, as he was
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023176_0059_0FBDE2DFEC571300"/>once, according to his own candid confe≈ø≈øion, in the number of tho≈øe, who di≈øputed the ≈øacred truths of revelation. You will receive great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure and improvement, likewi≈øe, from Addi≈øon's Evidences of Chri≈øtianity, arranged and collected into one volume, and from a late, ≈øimilar produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the celebrated Dr. Beattie.</p>
                     <p>Every <hi>word</hi> of the ≈øcriptures, indeed, mu≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any candid or thoughtful per≈øon, that they come from God. The pa≈ø≈øions, pride vices and intere≈øts of mankind have induced not a few to ≈øet up for ≈øceptics. "Much learning has made them mad," or a little has rendered them <hi>frivolous</hi> and conceited. They have ≈øought only to di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh them≈øelves by uncommon opinions; they have been <hi>dupes</hi> to their own <hi>fancied</hi> penetration; they have attempted to gra≈øp the immen≈øity of the Deity, in arms of <hi>fle≈øh,</hi> or have ≈øhrunk into ≈øcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici≈øm, as a refuge from their vices.</p>
                     <p>Hear what the ≈øcripture ≈øaith, <q>Every one, that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le≈øt his deeds ≈øhould be reproved.

How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and ≈øeck not the honour, which cometh of God only!</q>

                     <p>THE <hi>external</hi> te≈øtimony, in favour of the chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, ari≈øes from prophecy, miracles, and the corre≈øponding evidence of hi≈øtory. And the≈øe

                     <p>The whole ≈øacred book of the Old Te≈øtament is, from beginning to end, a clear prediction of the Me≈ø≈øiah. One of the prophets has foretold the preci≈øe year, in which this "righteous branch" ≈øhould make his appearance. And this event, you know, <hi>has</hi> taken place to the comfort of the chri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world.</p>
                     <p>Others have predicted the de≈øtruction of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øalem, Babylon, Tyre, the di≈øper≈øion and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Jews, &amp;c. long before they happened;‚Äî and all pro≈øane hi≈øtory, which has been written ≈øince their time, will inform you, that the≈øe aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øul judgments were wonderfully accompli≈øhed, in their proper ≈øea≈øon.</p>
                     <p>The Revelation contains <hi>darker</hi> hints of ≈øome events, that are vi≈øibly, though <hi>gradually</hi> fulfilling, at this moment. But as I can only <hi>glance</hi> at the ≈øubject, you will ≈øee it treated in ≈øuch a manner, as to confirm your faith and exait your devotion, in the late Bi≈øhop of Bri≈øtol (Dr. Newton's) di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes on the Prophecies.</p>
                     <p>The miracles of our Saviour and of his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate apo≈øtles meet you in every page of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpired book; and in <hi>profane</hi> hi≈øtory, you will learn from tho≈øe, who were avowed <hi>enemies</hi> to the cau≈øe, that, at a particular period of time, there <hi>did</hi> exi≈øt ≈øuch a ≈øacred per≈øonage, as Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who wrought miracles, healed the ≈øick, and rai≈øed the dead; ≈øuch a ≈øect, as that of Chri≈øtians, who met to receive the ≈øacrament, who bound them≈øelves by <hi>this</hi> oath, to commit no iniquity, practi≈øed a wonderful innocence and au≈øterity of manners, and,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023176_0061_0FBDE2E2B0014A98"/>beyond all example, loved one another. You will ≈øee likewi≈øe, in the ≈øame pages, a full de≈øcription of their manners, morals, ceremonies and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in≈øtitutions.</p>
                     <p>The lap≈øe of time, moreover, to us, who live in the≈øe <hi>later</hi> times, has given an <hi>additional</hi> force to the evidences, in favour of revelation. The ingenious author of the Spectator, in his day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered the particular ca≈øe of the Jews, their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, di≈øper≈øion, vagabond, un≈øettled ≈øtate, &amp;c. as a ≈øtanding and inconte≈øtable <hi>miracle,</hi> in ≈øupport of the ≈øacred writings. They <hi>≈øtill</hi> continue (what is there ≈øo circum≈øtantially foretold,) unable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with any people, and loaded with the hatred and abhorrence of all. The te≈øtimony, therefore, from <hi>their</hi> hi≈øtory is proportionably more illu≈øtrated and confirmed.</p>
                     <p>The de≈øtruction of the Romi≈øh church, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, is palpably predicted in the ≈øcriptures. And, if we may judge from ≈øtrong appearances, is daily approaching. The great and general diffu≈øion of knowledge; the con≈øequent progre≈øs of religious toleration, and that di≈øper≈øion of the mi≈øts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice from all eyes, produced by the genial rays of a meridian ≈øun, mu≈øt, in time, effect the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of all tyranny and ≈øuper≈øtition: whil≈øt the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, employed in de≈øtroying mona≈øteries, and encouraging population, appears an in≈øtrument in the hand of Providence, for accelerating the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of this au≈øpicious moment. The late di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberment, moreover, of territory from the Holy See; the contentions, in which the ≈øovereign pontiff has been involved by tho≈øe monarchs, who <hi>once</hi> trembled at his frown; and the mere <hi>external</hi> deference only, which is paid to his authority,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023176_0062_0FBDE2E42EEF2300"/>prove that his throne is tottering from its ba≈øe, and, like all other human things, approaching to its di≈ø≈øolution. Thus is our holy religion founded on a rock, again≈øt which the winds and waves of infidelity beat in vain. Proud men may rea≈øon, and wicked men pretend to doubt, but <q>the very gates of hell ≈øhall not prevail again≈øt it.</q>

                     <p>The hi≈øtory of the church, from the fir≈øt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the pre≈øent, is an hi≈øtory of the≈øe diffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions.

                     <p>There has been the ≈øame fa≈øhion in religions opinions, as in common things. Particular notions

                     <p>Nor is this the lea≈øt impeachment of our holy religion. The truth of that, like the God, whence it comes, is the "≈øame ye≈øterday, to-day and for ever." It is re≈øerved, as the privilege of a more glorious era, that all men ≈øhall be of one <q>heart and of one ≈øoul and keep the unity of the ≈øpirit in the bond of peace.</q>

                     <p>MAHOMETANS are ≈øo called from being followers of the great impo≈øtor, Mahomet.

                     <p>His tenets are contained in the Koran, which, for its ≈øingularity, is worth your reading.

                     <p>DISSENTER is a <hi>vague</hi> word, which, in its full latitude, may be applied to <hi>all,</hi> who differ from the e≈øtabli≈øhed religion. <hi>Originally,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it meant only one kind of people, <hi>then</hi> di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øhed by the name of pre≈øbyterians, who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther di≈ø≈øented from the <hi>di≈øcipline</hi> and <hi>polity,</hi> than the <hi>opinions,</hi> of the church. The≈øe, in general, embraced the <hi>≈øentiments</hi> of Calvin, relating to foreknowledge, divine decrees, irre≈øi≈øtible grace, prede≈øtination, reprobation, &amp;c.

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:023176_0072_0FBDE2F3300BF8F8"/>pre≈øbyters and ≈øynods. The word <hi>pre≈øbyter,</hi> means an elder, and <hi>≈øynod,</hi> an eccle≈øia≈øtical council or a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>pre≈øent</hi> race of di≈ø≈øenters may be ≈øtrictly ≈øubdivided into two cla≈ø≈øes; tho≈øe who ≈øtill retain the doctrines of Calvin, and his mode of di≈øcipline, and call them≈øelves, from their form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Independants;</hi> and ≈øuch as a≈ø≈øume the more ≈øpecious title of prote≈øtant di≈ø≈øenters. The fir≈øt are extremely rigid and puritanical in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deportment; but they do not breathe all the <hi>≈øweetne≈øs</hi> of piety, not are their annals un≈øtained with in≈øtances of intolerance and per≈øecution.‚Äî Their <hi>leader</hi> was a furious and unrelenting bigot. His murder of the poor hone≈øt Servetus will be an eternal ≈øtigma on his memory, and throw a dark ≈øhade over his pretended virtues.</p>
                     <p>Indeed how can people, with <hi>≈øuch</hi> ≈øentiments, act otherwi≈øe? If <hi>their</hi> God be only merciful to a <hi>few,</hi> elect, how ≈øhould <hi>they</hi> think of a <hi>general</hi> benevolence?

                     <p>I do not know that the latter kind of di≈ø≈øenters have any <hi>≈øettled</hi> code of faith. <q>Every mini≈øter has a p≈øalm of his own, has a doctrine, has an interpretation,</q> ≈øo that very <hi>oppo≈øite</hi> ≈øentiments may be con≈øi≈øtently delivered by different per≈øons, in the ≈øame pulpit.

                     <p>THE methodi≈øts are <hi>comparatively</hi> a new ≈øect, and ≈øprung up about ≈øixty years ago, under the au≈øpices of John We≈øley, and George Whitfield, then ≈øtudents at Oxford.

                     <p>They have been long divided into two cla≈ø≈øes according to the different principles, e≈øpou≈øed by their leaders. The fir≈øt follow the opinions of Arminius, under the guidance of We≈øley, who is <hi>≈øtill</hi> a very venerable looking patriarch, at their head; and the other, believing divine decrees, foreknowledge, reprobation and election, are more ≈øtrictly members of the kirk, (only that they do not admit its di≈øcipline) having long ≈øince lo≈øt their <hi>original</hi> director.<note n="*" place="bottom">George Whitfield.

                     </p>
                     <p>I do not know, that the methodi≈øts, (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they, who follow We≈øley,) are di≈ø≈øenters

They are baptized with <hi>us;</hi> attend our ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and ≈øacrament; admire our liturgy; and only blame us for our lukewarmne≈øs and want of ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and animation. This cen≈øure, it is true, comes but with a very ill grace from ≈øuch a people; but, I fear, we cannot ea≈øily refute it.</p>
                     <p>They had <hi>originally</hi> a great ≈øhare of <hi>enthu≈øia≈øm.</hi>‚Äî But it is greatly ≈øoftened by the indulgence they have received, and mellowed down by time. They are no longer, a new; they are no longer a <hi>per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted</hi> ≈øect.</p>
                     <p>The journals of We≈øley, written in the infancy of his career, are a ≈øtrange medley of goodne≈øs and enthu≈øia≈øm. The old man has lived long enough to have ≈øeen his error.

                     <p>The great error among≈øt this people, is their employing ≈øuch low, illiterate men as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructors, and fancying them under the <hi>immediate</hi> guidance of divine in≈øpiration‚Äîpreaching up the nece≈ø≈øity of <hi>in≈øtantaneous</hi> conver≈øion and ju≈øtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a ≈øort of <hi>miracle</hi>‚Äîmaking faith to con≈øi≈øt in a <hi>full a≈ø≈øurance</hi> of ≈øalvation, and denouncing dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation again≈øt tho≈øe, who have it not in this ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent degree‚Äîand la≈øtly, in ≈øuppo≈øing this a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance to depend on certain, <hi>inward extraordinary</hi> impul≈øes, rather than the ≈øcriptures.</p>

                     <p>The methodi≈øts were, <hi>once,</hi> extremely lavi≈øh in their cen≈øures of others; but ju≈øtice obliges me to confe≈øs, that they are now in general, an harmle≈øs, inoffen≈øive and pious people.

                     <p>THE my≈øtic theology boa≈øts ≈øome great names. Madame de Guion was a warm e≈øpou≈øer of it in France; a woman of great fa≈øhion and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, remarkable for the goodne≈øs of her heart, and the regularity of her conduct, but of a capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious un≈øettled temper, and liable to the ≈øeductions of a warm imagination.</p>
                     <p>The opinions of this lady made a great noi≈øe in that country, about the year 1687. They were confuted, ≈øome time afterwards, by the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bo≈ø≈øuet. The great and good Fenelon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her vindication; but his book was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Pope Innocent the twelfth.</p>
                     <p>The Teutonic philo≈øopher (Jacob Behemen,) was a kind of father to this ≈øect, and publi≈øhed a book, which contains a ≈øy≈øtem of the mo≈øt ab≈øurd and incoherent reveries, that perhaps ever gained an admi≈ø≈øion into the world. It is a ≈øpecies of moral chymi≈øtry, and occult philo≈øophy, a bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering explanation, and a cloudy light, which I will venture to ≈øay, that neither Sir I≈øaac Newton, nor Mr. Locke, with all their clearne≈øs of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could have been able to under≈øtand.</p>
                     <p>Law, who wrote the Serious Call (a nonjuror of Northampton≈øhire), was an abettor of the≈øe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines; a man of very exemplary life, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating talents; but it was an honour, re≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the late Baron Swedenborg to carry them to their very height of perfection<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Tho≈øe who embrace the tenets of Baron Swedenborg, have very lately begun to form them≈øelves into a ≈øeparate connexion, under the name of the New Jeru≈øalem Church.</note>.

                     <p>This will account for <hi>any</hi> reveries.

                     <p>It mu≈øt, however, be ≈øaid in favour of the my≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, that their principles inculcate in the ≈øtronge≈øt manner, the nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øpiritual holine≈øs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; that their lives in general, are
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023176_0086_0FBDE30923ECF1F8"/>unblemi≈øhed and exemplary. They are a quiet, retired people, who let the world go as it <hi>will,</hi> as to riches or promotions; who enjoy indeed, in a pa≈ø≈øive <hi>≈øuperiority,</hi> tho≈øe tumults of the crowd, as higher ≈øpirits may <hi>conde≈øcend</hi> to look down, with a pitying ≈ømile, on the toils of mortals; and who deny them≈øelves all the gayer plea≈øures, in order to reli≈øh, in a ≈øublimer degree, all the raptures of devotion.</p>
                     <p>If the opinions of the quieti≈øts ≈øpring from ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pride, it is more than they ≈øu≈øpect; for they preach up the deepe≈øt ≈øelf-aba≈øement, anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, and poverty of ≈øpirit; they almo≈øt ≈øtarve the <hi>animal</hi> part of their nature, to nur≈øe the <hi>angelic,</hi> and half <hi>live</hi> on meditation.</p>
                     <p>If ≈øuch people have errors, they ≈øhould be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a gentle hand. If they are mi≈øled, it is in <hi>amiable</hi> company. There is not a much more lovely name than that of Fenelon. Few men have po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed ≈øuch a ≈øweetne≈øs of piety.</p>
                     <p>I have but one wi≈øh for them, my≈øelf, or any other ≈øect, and it is a wi≈øh of charity; that what is wrong in <hi>any of us,</hi> may be done away, becau≈øe I long to meet them all in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

                     <p>THE Dei≈øts are ≈øo called, perhaps, from the Latin word, <hi>Deus,</hi> a God; becau≈øe they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only the exi≈øtence of a God, profe≈øs no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form or ≈øy≈øtem of religion, and only follow the law and light of nature.

                     <p>Dei≈øm is <hi>generally</hi> embraced, either by men of a cold, phlegmatic, philo≈øophical ca≈øt, who are indi≈øpo≈øed to believe any thing, for which they have not ab≈øolute demon≈øtration, or by tho≈øe, who, having never thought or rea≈øoned, con≈øider it as a mark of wit and talents, to ≈øet up for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt de≈øerve an an≈øwer, and it is ea≈øy. All <hi>nature</hi> is full of my≈øteries, as well as revelation; the union of ≈øoul and body is a <hi>miracle;</hi> the infinite divi≈øibility of matter, and the idea of an <hi>eternal</hi> duration are ab≈øolutely incomprehen≈øible; nothing can be more ≈øo, than the nece≈ø≈øary <hi>≈øelf-exi≈øtence</hi> of God. The latter are better an≈øwered with irony. Their infidelity is a fa≈øhionable <hi>livery.</hi> When dei≈øm is not in vogue among≈øt the gay cireles, they will ≈øoon put it off, and di≈øavow their ever having worn ≈øo ab≈øolete a garb.</p>
                     <p>A third cla≈øs of dei≈øts may be ≈øaid to ≈øpring up from the ≈øuper≈øtitions of Rome. Great men, who live in catholic countries, are di≈øgu≈øted with their bigotry, and are apt to think religion in <hi>general</hi> only an <hi>impo≈øition</hi> on the credulity of mankind. Was not this the ca≈øe with all that ≈øplendid group, Rou≈ø≈øeau, Voltaire, the Abbe de Raynal, and Helvetius, who wrote a famous treati≈øe <hi>de l' E≈øprit?</hi> Genius hates ≈øhackles, and ≈øhackles are the <hi>peculiar</hi> manufacture of Rome.</p>
                     <p>A fourth cla≈øs of dei≈øts are continually produced by the love of fame, venting it≈øelf in paradoxes, and ≈øingular opinions to make a noi≈øe; by an aver≈øion to the ≈øtrictne≈øs of go≈øpel morality, and

But their books, on a <hi>near</hi> view, have been found only gi≈øt and lettered with <hi>vanity,</hi> and have quickly been con≈øigned to the oblivion, they de≈øerved. Whil≈øt we are in <hi>this</hi> world, enemies will mix the≈øe <hi>tares</hi> with the good ≈øeed of the go≈øpel. We mu≈øt wait till <hi>harve≈øt,</hi> to ≈øee the final ≈øeparation.</p>
                     <p>The dei≈øts are the greate≈øt enemies, of all others, to true religion. Their pride and ≈øceptici≈øm ≈øtop up every avenue, by which divine grace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction ≈øhould be conveyed to the ≈øoul. Nature, with <hi>them,</hi> is only a <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> ≈øy≈øtem of cau≈øes and effects. Creation ro≈øe into its pre≈øent ≈øplendour, by a kind of <hi>fatality.</hi> Thunders roar, lightnings fla≈øh, volcanos vomit, tempe≈øts rage, ≈øeas overflow, millions peri≈øh, and kingdoms are de≈øolated, only by a train of <hi>≈øtated,</hi> inevitable cau≈øes.

                     <p>Few of the≈øe men have <hi>died</hi> in peace. Their fortitude has de≈øerted them, when they wanted its ≈øupport.

                     <p>TRAVELLERS, that have made (what is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) the grand tour, felicitate them≈øelves on their return to England, and pronounce it the happie≈øt country in the world. And ≈øuch it certainly is, if not in beauty and deliciou≈øne≈øs of climate, yet in that ab≈øolute <hi>≈øecurity</hi> of property it enjoys above all other nations, and that <hi>liberty,</hi> which endears eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</p>
                     <p>If you have made proper ob≈øervations on the different, religious ≈øects, that have pa≈ø≈øed in review before us, you will feel much the ≈øame ≈øentiment, when you compare them with your own church.‚Äî You will be the <hi>moral</hi> traveller returned from more unplea≈øant ≈øcenes, to ta≈øte the ble≈ø≈øings of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe and dignity at home.

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023176_0091_0FBDE3106BDEF118"/>offend the delicacy of the ≈øublime≈øt under≈øtanding. It aims not at the <hi>total</hi> ab≈øtraction of di≈ø≈øenters, nor affects the ≈øuper≈øtitious forms and ceremonies of the Church of Rome. Its piety has a rational, ≈øedate, compo≈øed air, and is uniformly grave and decent without pretending to the flights, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and the vi≈øions of ≈øome, <hi>modern</hi> fanatics.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øacraments are not ridiculou≈øly multiplied, nor has <hi>human</hi> policy inveated them. They are but two in number, bapti≈øm and the Lord's ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; both po≈øitively enjoined by Chri≈øt, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ≈øuppo≈øed to have any further merit, than as they lead to purity of heart and conduct. The <hi>liturgy</hi> has been admired by the greate≈øt men; the mini≈øters of this church are, in general, an ornament to their ≈øacred profe≈ø≈øion, and perhaps, on the whole, men of as great learning, candour, piety and moderation, as are to be found under any communion. That there were no <hi>exceptions,</hi> would be a <hi>miracle.</hi> There was a Judas among≈øt twelve apo≈øtles.</p>
                     <p>After all the <hi>fine-≈øpun</hi> theories of liberty, every ≈øociety mu≈øt have a mode of government; and that government ≈øuppo≈øes power to be lodged <hi>≈øome where</hi> for the general good. That of the Church of England is ve≈øted in bi≈øhops; no one will di≈øpute the <hi>antiquity,</hi> or perhaps u≈øefulne≈øs of the order, whatever he may object to its temporal di≈øtinctions. St. Paul appointed bi≈øhops in the primitive church.</p>
                     <p>Much abu≈øe is often levelled again≈øt the ≈øacred bench. But the ≈øhafts come from <hi>envy,</hi> and are pointed by religious prejudice and re≈øentment. It is, in fact, their <hi>temporal</hi> emoluments, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke this ungenerous kind of per≈øecution. But if they mu≈øt attend <hi>parliament,</hi> they have indeed no

                        <hi>≈øuper-abundant</hi> provi≈øion. Whil≈øt it is thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to have a <hi>national</hi> church, the intere≈øts of it, as connected with the ≈øtate, mu≈øt frequently be a ≈øubject of parliamentary di≈øcu≈ø≈øion; and it would be very extraordinary indeed, if they, who are mo≈øt <hi>immediately</hi> concerned ≈øhould not have the liberty of giving their opinion and <hi>votes</hi> on the occa≈øion. Whatever <hi>equal</hi> right, from education or abilities, the bi≈øhops may po≈ø≈øe≈øs, along with the <hi>temporal</hi> peers of the realm, to deliver their ≈øentiments on any <hi>other</hi> ≈øubject, they exerci≈øe it very <hi>rarely,</hi> and with great <hi>di≈øcretion.</hi> Their hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours too, it ≈øhould be ob≈øerved, u≈øually come late in life, and the hope of attaining them, at ≈øome <hi>di≈øtant</hi> period, is doubtle≈øs, among≈øt the younger clergy, a ≈øtrong incentive to emulation.</p>
                     <p>But prejudice apart, the bi≈øhops, in general, perform their ≈øacred duties with great decorum, and the pre≈øent bench can boa≈øt the names of ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral who, without the aid of purple, would be an ornament to human nature.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="unknown:023176_0093_0FBDE3136D06E2D0"/>very great attachment to the <hi>e≈ø≈øentials</hi> of our holy faith.</p>
                     <p>We might, perhaps, borrow from <hi>≈øectaries,</hi> without any inconvenience, a little more <hi>zeal,</hi> fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and animation. If our <hi>internal</hi> di≈øcipline, like theirs, was more rigidly inforced, and if, like them, we had a few more conferences with our people, and an opportunity of keeping the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy from the altar, we ≈øhould be ≈øo much nearer the model of perfection.</p>
                     <p>But alas! the <hi>great</hi> evil among≈øt us, is a want of <hi>encouragement.</hi> The church, at any rate, has but a ≈ømall pittance. A learned prelate<note n="*" place="bottom">The B‚Äîp of L‚Äîd‚Äîff.</note> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, that, if all its dignities, (bi≈øhopricks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,) were annulled, and their produce thrown into one common, equalizing fund, for the <hi>general</hi> ≈øupport, the amount of annual ≈øalary, to every <hi>individual</hi> would not exceed ¬£. 120, or at mo≈øt, ¬£. 150.</p>
                     <p>Under ≈øuch circum≈øtances, who can be very animated? Or what energy can attend the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of our profe≈ø≈øion in the eyes of a world, that ≈øuperciliou≈øly appreciates the characters of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more by their temporal po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, than by the graces of their heart, or the ≈øublimity of their under≈øtanding. To a per≈øon of any refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ≈øen≈øibility, hou≈øes without conveniences, and children, without provi≈øion, are but a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy portion! If <hi>merchants</hi> or <hi>lawyers</hi> had no better pro≈øpects, what would be <hi>their</hi> exertions? And yet under all this heavy load of embarra≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what great and good men do our annals boa≈øt?</p>

                     <p>BOOKS and rules of all kinds are the <hi>theory</hi> of religion, and can have no further u≈øe, than as they lead to <hi>practice.</hi> We have <hi>then</hi> profited by ≈øy≈øtems and opinions, when our life is a continual <hi>comment</hi> on what we have read, and we make the light of our example ≈øhine before men.</p>
                     <p>Chri≈øtianity has but two, capital features; love to God, evidenced in acts of piety; and good will towards man, exemplified in all the po≈ø≈øibilities of doing good. As devotion, however nece≈ø≈øary, can bring no profit to our Maker, any more than a little taper can add to the ≈øplendors of the ≈øun, the ≈øcriptures have laid the greate≈øt ≈øtre≈øs on charity to our <hi>fellow-creatures.</hi> This is called the <q>end
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023176_0095_0FBDE3166C4A6100"/>of the commandment;</q> it is the <hi>embodying</hi> of our piety; and the world could not ≈øub≈øi≈øt without it. Human life is full of woe. Charity is the <hi>angel,</hi> that binds up the ≈øores of our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, heals the broken in heart, clothes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and feeds the hungry. The poor are made the repre≈øentatives of Chri≈øt; whatever we give to <hi>them</hi> is, in ≈øcripture language, be≈øtowed on the <hi>Saviour.</hi> Moth and ru≈øt corrupt the trea≈øures we hoard up, but this is placed in tho≈øe funds of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which never fail.</p>
                     <p>The Saviour has ≈øaid, that <q>it is more ble≈ø≈øed to give than to receive.</q> And the plea≈øures, which ≈øpring from charity, prove its origin to be divine. What value has an heap of money, or what con≈øcious dignity do we derive from it, if it is not employed in giving comfort to the mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and protection to the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed?</p>
                     <p>The very <hi>poor</hi> are provided for by the laws of the kingdom. And <hi>common</hi> beggars are far from being the mo≈øt de≈øerving objects. Charity ≈øhould rather ≈øeek out the mode≈øt and uncomplaining who have ≈øeen better days, and have all the pains of a delicate ≈øen≈øibility, annexed to their di≈øtre≈øs.</p>
                     <p>True charity does not ≈øo much con≈øi≈øt in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying little alms to a number of poor people, as in making ≈øome grand and well directed efforts in favour of a few. Educating one child of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened family is a greater act of beneficence, than <hi>retailing</hi> to them, occa≈øionally, a thou≈øand, <hi>petty</hi> benefactions. It is not a few, ≈øcattered drops of rain, but it is a generous ≈øhower, coming all at once, which revives the parched earth, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens vegetation.</p>

                     <p>THE very fir≈øt thing I ≈øhould recommend after religious duties, as ab≈øolutely e≈ø≈øential to your private comfort, is <hi>≈øelf-government</hi> in the fulle≈øt ≈øen≈øe of the word. This may be ≈øuppo≈øed to be included under the article of religion. And ≈øo in fact it is. But there are many well di≈øpo≈øed people, that ≈øeem to think little things of this kind almo≈øt beneath their notice, though in reality they are interwoven with the repo≈øe of every day, and almo≈øt every moment.</p>
                     <p>The di≈øcipline of the <hi>imagination</hi> is the fir≈øt thing to be attempted. This, in young people, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally warm; and if they are not cautious, will be apt to mi≈ølead them into very dangerous errors.</p>
                     <p>Thus whatever captivates their <hi>fancy,</hi> they take, without examination, to be all over excellence. Tin≈øel, becau≈øe it <hi>glitters</hi> more, will be preferred to ≈øolid <hi>gold;</hi> a luxuriant, florid ≈øtyle in a writer; to the ≈øounde≈øt and be≈øt arranged arguments; the ≈øhewy and brilliant in <hi>characters,</hi> to the truly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, and the gaudy in <hi>dre≈øs,</hi> to that artle≈øs ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, which is the offspring of an elegant and well cultivated ta≈øte.</p>

The truth is, ≈øome females have been <hi>viragos</hi> in their knowledge, not only injudicious in the <hi>kind</hi> they have a≈øpired to, but the <hi>u≈øe</hi> they have made of it, and an <hi>indi≈øcriminate</hi> ≈øtigma has been fixed upon all, who have endeavoured <hi>rationally</hi> to improve their under≈øtandings.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, it is ≈øaid of women, that they are ≈øo ignorant, frivolus and in≈øipid, as to be unfit for friend≈øhip, ≈øociety or conver≈øation; that they are unable to amu≈øe, entertain or edify a lonely hour, much more to ble≈øs or grace that connexion, for which they were principally formed.</p>
                     <p>What, my dear girl, can a <hi>judicious</hi> woman do, in ≈øuch a dilemma? How mu≈øt ≈øhe act to avoid the imputation of pedantry on the one hand, and ignorance on the other.</p>
                     <p>There is a narrow, <hi>middle</hi> path betwixt the≈øe extremes. Judgment mu≈øt point it out, and good ≈øen≈øe direct you in the execution.</p>
                     <p>The prominent excellencies of your minds are ta≈øte and imagination, and your knowledge ≈øhould be of a kind, which <hi>a≈ø≈øimilates</hi> with the≈øe faculties. Politics, philo≈øophy, mathematics, or metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øics are not <hi>your</hi> province. Machiavel, Newton, Euclid, Malebranche or Locke would lie with a very ill grace in your clo≈øets. They would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you <hi>unwomanly</hi> indeed. They would damp that vivacity and de≈øtroy that di≈øengaged ea≈øe and <hi>≈øoftne≈øs,</hi> which are the very <hi>e≈ø≈øence</hi> of your graces.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>elegant</hi> ≈øtudies are, more immediately, <hi>your</hi> department. They do not require ≈øo much time, ab≈øtraction or comprehen≈øivene≈øs of mind; they bring no wrinkles, and they will give a poli≈øh to your manners, and ≈øuch a liberal expan≈øion to

                     <p>If indeed you con≈øider hi≈øtory in its proper light, not as a mere detail of names, facts, epochs, and events, but as a picture of human nature, and of the wonderful admini≈øtration of Providence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning rewards and puni≈øhments to nations, and frequently to individuals, according their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it will become not only an entertaining ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but a ≈øource of the ≈øublime≈øt, <hi>moral</hi> improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>ROBERTSON's hi≈øtory of Charles the fifth, and of Mary Queen of Scots, will both in≈øtruct and entertain you. The hi≈øtoriographer has been e≈øteemed an excellent writer. But I have always, in private, thought his ≈øtyle too laboured and ≈øtately. It has not the ea≈øe and ≈øimplicity of the ancients. It does not equal ≈øeveral of the moderns. It has neither the conci≈øe energy of Hume, nor the more flowing and ea≈øy graces of Gibbon.</p>

The late Dr. Stewart, in a very elegant work, has controverted almo≈øt all the a≈ø≈øertions of his predece≈ø≈øor, concerning Mary, and become the champion of this unfortunate queen. But <hi>you</hi> have nothing to do with literary controver≈øy. Leave them to the tribunal of an impartial public. <hi>Time</hi> will weight their ≈øeparate merits in the balance of truth. Either or both of them will exerci≈øe your ta≈øte, and improve your under≈øtanding.</p>

                     <p>The hi≈øtory of Greece and Rome is ≈øo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alluded to, ≈øo connected with that of almo≈øt all other nations, and ≈øo full of curious incidents and anecdotes, that a little knowledge of it would be very u≈øeful and entertaining. But, in general, the writers on the ≈øubject are too voluminous for a <hi>female.</hi> They make up no little ≈øhare of the labour, in a cla≈ø≈øical education. Gold≈ømith has likewi≈øe given his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to epitomize this branch of hi≈øtory. I know no other writer ≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for your purpo≈øe.</p>
                     <p>To attain ju≈øt a <hi>glimp≈øe</hi> of general hi≈øtory, the mo≈øt u≈øeful work I recollect, is the Abb√© Millot's <hi>Elements ≈øur l'Hi≈øtoire.</hi> On <hi>his</hi> comprehen≈øive and conden≈øed plan, there is much in a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈øs.

                     <p>ROLLIN's ancient hi≈øtory is a trea≈øure to young people, if the number of volumes does not alarm you.

He labours to promote religious improvement by every incident, he relates.

                     <p>THOUGH I think every woman in the world ≈øhould execrate the memory of the late Lord Che≈øterfield, as having written the mo≈øt ≈øcandalous libels on her ≈øex, yet his ≈øketches of heathen my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology, of Grecian, Roman, and Briti≈øh hi≈øtory, in the fir≈øt volume of his letters, are well worth your attention. If this ingenious nobleman had given us more ≈øpecimens of <hi>this</hi> nature, and fewer lectures on <hi>the graces</hi> and <hi>intrigue,</hi> the gratitude of po≈øterity would have <hi>imbalmed</hi> his a≈øhes. He was certainly po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of an elegant ≈øtyle, and had a very happy method of conveying his in≈øtructions.</p>
                     <p>But in order to make any real improvement in this, or any <hi>other</hi> of your ≈øtudies, let me advi≈øe you to read only one half hour, at a time, and to employ a <hi>double</hi> ≈øpace, in abridging and expre≈ø≈øing what you recollect, in your <hi>own</hi> language.

                     <p>Though a good ≈øtyle is, doubtle≈øs, a mark of genius, and not attainable by every per≈øon, yet it depends amazingly on <hi>mechanical</hi> habit, as well as our gait, countenance or ge≈øture.

It is, however, in my idea, too flattering a portrait. The painter was a countryman, and an admirer. No talents can convert deformity into beauty, or make darkne≈øs to be light.</p>
                     <p>Swift was a very great, original genius; but the indecency of ≈øome of his writings is intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; his ≈øpleen, exce≈ø≈øive, and his behaviour to Stella an <hi>eternal</hi> ≈øtigma on his memory and his virtues. Ever dabbling in the turbid ocean of politics, what bu≈øine≈øs had he with the quiet and retired haven of the church? But genius and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents can embelli≈øh any ≈øide of a ≈øubject, and the biographer has poured, on his favourite author, a deluge of panegyric.</p>
                     <p>The life of Garrick is ≈øo much inter≈øper≈øed with the <hi>dome≈øtic</hi> hi≈øtory, and the mo≈øt illu≈øtrious per≈øons of his time, that it will highly engage and gratify your curio≈øity. It is written by Davies in two volumes.</p>
                     <p>England has long laboured with a di≈øorder, that I cannot call by a better name, than the <hi>theatrical
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:023176_0121_0FBDE13C796081D0"/>mania.</hi> A principal actor is more di≈øtingui≈øhed, care≈ø≈øed and enriched by a luxurious nation, than many of the mo≈øt de≈øerving per≈øons, in the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profe≈ø≈øions. An Abingdon, a Siddons, and a Mara (as once a Garrick, a Hender≈øon, and a Yates,) inchant the feelings of a Briti≈øh audience, drain the money which ≈øhould be ≈øacred to better purpo≈øes, acquire, in a few years, an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fortune and are admitted to the fir≈øt circles in the kingdom, whil≈øt a thou≈øand, amiable and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious clergymen are ≈øuffered to live in want, and to die in the mo≈øt uncomfortable ob≈øcurity. This is not a very favourable trait in the <hi>moral</hi> hi≈øtory of a nation. It ≈øeems rather a ≈øymptom of its approaching di≈ø≈øolution.</p>
                     <p>Hume was a great champion of infidelity, and as ≈øuch, a character, that excites uncommon curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity. He has written his own life, and, as an unique in biography, it is worthy your reading.</p>
                     <p>Bolingbroke was another of the <hi>≈øceptical</hi> family. His hi≈øtory is agreeably recorded by Dr. Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ømith.</p>
                     <p>On the ≈øubject of biography, you will meet with a great variety of other, entertaining writers; but I mu≈øt not clo≈øe this article, without particularly recommending a book, that has given me ≈øo much plea≈øure and information, as the life and writings of Gray, by Mr. Ma≈øon.</p>
                     <p>A particular friend≈øhip of the warme≈øt and mo≈øt di≈øintere≈øted kind, ≈øub≈øi≈øted betwixt the≈øe celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed authors. It commenced in that early period of life, when ≈øouls are incapable of guile or ≈øelfi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and mutally <hi>expand;</hi> and Ma≈øon has endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to immortalize it in a manner, which does equal credit to his heart and under≈øtanding.</p>

The hi≈øtory of a retired, literary per≈øon cannot, generally, pre≈øent much variety of entertainment. But in the character of Gray, there is ≈øomewhat very <hi>intere≈øting;</hi> and his friend has di≈øplayed it to the greate≈øt advantage. No man, perhaps, by ≈øuch <hi>≈ølight</hi> ≈øketches, as the author of an Elegy in a country church-yard has left behind him, ever acquired ≈øo exten≈øive a reputation. And there was a dignity, a ≈øoftne≈øs and a delicacy in his <hi>whole</hi> manner of thinking and acting, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øate for the want of more remarkable anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, and of more ≈øounding connexions.</p>

                        <q>THERE is not (≈øays a ≈øen≈øible writer,) a ≈øon or daughter of Adam, who has not ≈øome concern in the knowledge of Geography.</q> It is nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to your under≈øtanding the connexion, which this globe has with the other planetary ≈øy≈øtem, and with all the wonderful works of God. It is indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øible to your comprehending hi≈øtory, or having a proper idea of the events and tran≈øactions it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, as well as to dive≈øt your mind of little, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row prejudices by giving you a view of the cu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, manners, ceremonies and in≈øtitutions of all the different nations over the world.</p>

A celebrated writer<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Che≈øterfield.</note> has called geography and chronology, the two <hi>eyes</hi> of hi≈øtory; the fir≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms you <hi>where</hi> events happened, and the latter, at what particular <hi>period;</hi> if it was not for the≈øe helps your reading would be a confu≈øed chaos, without order, light or per≈øpicuity.</p>
                     <p>Geography is, indeed, ≈øo much attended to at all ≈øchools, that there is little occa≈øion to dwell on its nece≈ø≈øity; if you have learned the u≈øe of the globes, and the divi≈øion of it by names, which are only <hi>fancied</hi> for the ≈øake of reducing the immen≈øity of it to the narrow ≈øcale of human comprehen≈øion, the be≈øt method, I know, is never to read the name of a place in a common news paper, or any other hi≈øtory, without immediately recurring to authorities for the ≈øituation and divi≈øion of the country in which it lies, the manners of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, their ceremonies, civil government, and religious in≈øtitutions. It is this mode of ≈øtudying from the <hi>urgency</hi> of the occa≈øion, which gives energy to our re≈øearches and vigour to improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Guthrie is one of the be≈øt authors in geography; and for chronology, the tables of Dr. Prie≈øtley (a name, which I would only mention, where ≈øcience and not <hi>religion,</hi> is concerned,) are ≈øo compendious and comprehen≈øive, as to afford you, on a ≈øingle glance, con≈øiderable information. There is no ≈øpecies of knowledge, that is ≈øo ea≈øily attained, as that of geography: nor any of which the want is more flagrant and awkward.</p>
                     <p>I lately blu≈øhed for a young lady, who was a≈øked in company, the latitude and ≈øituation of a
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:023176_0124_0FBDE140ED193E08"/>particular place, which happened to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the public papers of the day. She was dre≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the highe≈øt ta≈øte. The ro≈øes and carnations vied in her countenance. She piques her≈øelf on her ≈ømartne≈øs and vivacity; but in this in≈øtance, could make no reply. Her <hi>embarra≈ø≈øment</hi> betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ignorance, and <hi>politene≈øs</hi> relieved it by a change of conver≈øation.</p>
                     <p>How much higher would her character have ≈øtood in the e≈øtimation of all ≈øentible and di≈øcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, if ≈øhe had come down ≈øtairs, dre≈ø≈øed in an elegant plainne≈øs, and, in≈øtead of ≈øtanding ≈øo long before her gla≈øs, had devoted ≈øome little ≈øhare of her time to this ≈øpecies of improvement. Not that I have any objection to a blu≈øh upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's cheek. I think the crim≈øon tint ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but I would have <hi>yours</hi> to be the blu≈øh of <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> and <hi>re≈øerve,</hi> not of <hi>ignorance, ≈øhyne≈øs</hi> or <hi>ill-breeding.</hi>

                     <p>NATURAL hi≈øtory is another ≈øtudy, which I conceive to be particularly <hi>feminine.</hi> It has, of late, been cultivated with uncommon attention. Botany has been, particularly, fa≈øhionable. It has found a place in the amu≈øements of the elegant,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:023176_0125_0FBDE14267249588"/>as well as the learned. Nothing is more calculated to amu≈øe the mind, improve the health and ≈øpirits, and to in≈øpire at once cheerfulne≈øs and devotion.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øuprizing hi≈øtory of plants and flowers, the immen≈øe variety, the mechani≈øm, order, government and economy of animals, fowls with their plumage and fi≈øhes with their ≈øcales, fo≈ø≈øils, minerals, petrefactions, mountains, vallies, vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos, all nature full of life, full of happine≈øs and full of miracles, will crowd your mind with the ≈øublime≈øt images, and teach you to adore the great, almighty former and pre≈øerver of the world. What beauty in each flower! What traits of divine wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs in an in≈øect! Surveyed with a truly philo≈øophical eye, the whole creation is a temple! Not a ≈øhrub, but is eloquent, not an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malcule, but is a powerful monitor of virtue!</p>
                     <p>I never ≈øpend an afternoon with Mi≈øs Loui≈øa ‚Äîwithout being both in≈øtructed and delighted. I never take a walk with her in the garden, but ≈øhe unfolds a thou≈øand, natural curio≈øities, which had hitherto e≈øcaped my un≈øcienced or inattentive eyes. I never ramble with her into the fields, but ≈øhe gives me ≈øuch an hi≈øtory of the mo≈øt common plants and flowers, as at once ≈øurprizes my curio≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and gratifies my ta≈øte. In her clo≈øet ≈øhe has a large collection of in≈øects, which her micro≈øcope clothes with mo≈øt exqui≈øite beauty, and a mu≈øeum, filedd with ≈øhells, corals, and petrefactions, the ≈øparkling of which is exceeded by nothing, but the vivacity of her eyes, or the ≈øtronger or more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent lu≈øtre of her virtues.</p>
                     <p>I would infinitely rather have her ta≈øte, than her fortune. And I never quit her without ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly envying her enjoyments. She is ever
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:023176_0126_0FBDE143E7852C18"/>≈øprightly, becau≈øe ≈øhe has never a moment <hi>unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</hi> She always <hi>≈ømiles,</hi> becau≈øe ≈øhe is always innocent. Her plea≈øures are of the rational and <hi>refined</hi> kind. They never leave a thorn in the heart, or pluck one, blu≈øhing ro≈øe from her cheeks. How ≈øolid and how calm, if compared with the midnight revels of fa≈øhion, or the giddine≈øs of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration!</p>
                     <p>Be like Loui≈øa, my dear girl, and you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be happy. Study nature, till it leads you up to nature's God. Pore on plants and flowers, till they perfume you with a <hi>real</hi> devotion; and I will engage you to become, in your turn, one of the mo≈øt beautiful flowers in the creation.</p>

                     <p>NATURAL hi≈øtory is divided into three grand parts, as it re≈øpects the animal, the mineral, and the vegetable kingdoms, and under the≈øe different ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, a≈ø≈øumes the name of zoology, or an hi≈øtory of animals; lithology, or a de≈øcription of ≈øtones, fo≈ø≈øils, &amp;c. and botany, or an account of herbs, plants, flowers. The≈øe again have, each their re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective ≈øubdivi≈øions.</p>
                     <p>Linnaeus, who was born at Up≈øal, is the great father of this ≈øcience, and from the Swedi≈øh ≈øchool have i≈ø≈øued the works of the mo≈øt eminent ma≈øters. But he is too voluminous and ≈øcientific for a female, who wants only a <hi>general</hi> knowledge
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:023176_0127_0FBDE1456422B3B0"/>of nature, and not to penetrate the minutiae of her plan.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Amaenitates Academicae</hi> are a number of ingenious e≈ø≈øays on a variety of ≈øubjects, ≈øelected from the works of the mo≈øt capital di≈øciples of the Linnaean ≈øchool. Some of tho≈øe have been tran≈ølated by Stillingfleet, under the name of Tracts on Natural Hi≈øtory, and are very valuable and in≈øtructive; 'others by Brand, in two volumes, which contain a number of very curious and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining de≈øcriptions.</p>
                     <p>Pulteny's View of the Works of Linnaeus you may read, likewi≈øe, with great plea≈øure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. Next to the≈øe I ≈øhould recommend to a mere Engli≈øh reader, the works of Ray: him, who wrote "The wi≈ødom of God in the creation." They are highly u≈øeful and valuable, though writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before this ≈øtudy had arrived to its pre≈øent ≈øtate of perfection.</p>
                     <p>Gold≈ømith's Hi≈øtory of the Earth and animated Nature is but a mere compilation. Still it may have its u≈øe, as affording ≈øome <hi>collateral</hi> lights and in≈øtruction.</p>
                     <p>Buffon is an author of fir≈øt rate abilities. His ≈øtyle is ≈øplendid; his knowledge is exten≈øive, and his eloquence, in a high degree, brilliant and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing. But I cannot recommend him for many rea≈øons. He is too <hi>voluminous;</hi> the exten≈øivene≈øs of his plan leads him into a great variety of detail, and of <hi>inddicate</hi> de≈øcriptions. He is more attached to ≈øy≈øtems of his own, than the di≈øcovery of trath; and he is a ≈øort of <hi>≈øceptic,</hi> who re≈øolves every thing into a chain of <hi>≈øecondary</hi> cau≈øes, and <hi>≈øacrilegiou≈øly</hi> excludes the Deity from his creation. This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is the <hi>bane</hi> of <hi>modern</hi> philo≈øophers. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:023176_0128_0FBDE146E6C4A308"/>to account for <hi>every</hi> thing upon <hi>natural</hi> principles, and wherever they are puzzled, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øly di≈øbelieve. In≈øtead of making their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a ≈øcaffolding to God, they build on it, a monument to their own vanity and folly, which will not ≈øtand, "when winds and ≈øtorms ari≈øe." Do people of ≈øuch di≈øtingui≈øhed abilities need to be reminded, that a world without de≈øign, or an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive machine, without a <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> moving principle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves the greate≈øt and mo≈øt palpable of contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Nature, in the hands of a <hi>true</hi> philo≈øopher, reads a continual le≈ø≈øon of piety; in tho≈øe of a <hi>fal≈øe</hi> one, it is the parent of ≈øceptici≈øm, gloom and de≈øpair. Sir I≈øaac Newton was the mo≈øt pious of men; many of his <hi>humble</hi> followers have been as impious <hi>retailers</hi> of infidelity.</p>
                     <p>You will derive great plea≈øure and improvement from all the writings of Mr. Pennant, and they are numerous. Always lively and always authentic, they entertain the man of ta≈øte, the ≈øcholar, and the antiquarian, as well as the naturali≈øt. Few per≈øons have publi≈øhed ≈øo much, in any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of ≈øcience, with ≈øo great ≈øucce≈øs.</p>
                     <p>The Flora Londinen≈øis of Curtis is a ≈øplendid work, that does credit to the author. It is embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed with beautiful engravings of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon plants and flowers of this country, and is ≈øtill in continuation.</p>
                     <p>Volcanoes are among≈øt the <hi>prodigies</hi> of nature, which fill the mind with the grande≈øt and ≈øublime≈øt images. Hamilton's account of them, and Ra≈øpe on the volcanos in Germany, will a≈øtoni≈øh your imagination. You may add to the li≈øt Swammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's Hi≈øtory of In≈øects, tran≈ølated by Floyd, and revi≈øed by Dr. Hill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="unknown:023176_0129_0FBDE1486361ADA0"/>
But I will de≈øi≈øt, for if I was to give you only the <hi>names</hi> of writers on the ≈øubject, they would fill a volume. No private fortune would be ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to purcha≈øe them, and the peru≈øal would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more time, than would con≈øi≈øt with your other, various engagements.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="unknown:023176_0131_0FBDE14B65F358E8"/>poetry, among≈øt other things, was ab≈øolutely <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,</hi> as tending to <hi>enervate</hi> the minds of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and unfit them for the ≈øtruggles and activities of life; and it is certain that the owners of an exqui≈øite ≈øen≈øibility, for a few <hi>moments</hi> of plea≈øure, have <hi>days</hi> of vexation.

                     <p>With a fortune, that only ju≈øtified a neat and <hi>homely</hi> dwelling, his genius was not content with le≈øs than the ≈øuperb appendages of a palace. In forming the <hi>Lea≈øeowes,</hi> he ≈øacrificed to enthu≈øia≈øm, what he owed to contentment. He panted for a <hi>paradi≈øe,</hi> and a paradi≈øe he had; but it ≈øoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a wilderne≈øs of thorns. Mercile≈øs creditors had no candour for the poet, and made no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the exqui≈øitene≈øs of his ta≈øte.</p>
                     <p>They ≈øaw no charms in ≈øhrubs, in blo≈ø≈øoms, or in pro≈øpects, and they awoke him with an iron gra≈øp, from his delicious intrancement.

                     <p>THOUGH I do not with you to become a poet, it is, however, nece≈ø≈øary, that you ≈øhould not be wholly unacquainted with the writings of many, inimitable bards. They will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine your ta≈øte, and ≈øpread a very elegant repa≈øt for your private amu≈øement.</p>
                     <p>Shake≈øpeare is, perhaps, the fir≈øt genius of the world; and ≈øome of his dramatic works, whil≈øt they a≈øtoni≈øh, will give you an u≈øeful fund of hi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical information.</p>
                     <p>The immortal poem of Paradi≈øe Lo≈øt ≈øhould not only be in the <hi>hands,</hi> but graven on the <hi>heart,</hi> of every woman, becau≈øe Milton, above all other authors, de≈øcribes the di≈øtingui≈øhing graces of the ≈øex, and in his Eve, has exhibited an exqui≈øite pattern of female perfection. On <hi>this</hi> ≈øubject, his feelings were always awakened in an extraordinary manner; his imagination glowed, and he has given it the fine≈øt touches of his pencil.</p>
                     <p>Milton like all great men, was fully ≈øen≈øible of the ble≈ø≈øings we derive from the ≈øociety of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and how <hi>cheerle≈øs</hi> the face of nature would have been without them. He, therefore, <hi>labours</hi>
                        <pb n="124" facs="unknown:023176_0133_0FBDE14E9B0A16B0"/>to make the mother of his Paradi≈øe every thing, that could charm, and every thing that could alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the infelicities of life. Let the libertine read his de≈øcription of marriage, and tell me what he thinks of the prevailing rage for impurity and ≈øeduction.</p>
                     <p>Homer is univer≈øally celebrated; and, though you cannot read his poem in the original language, Pope has given an admirable tran≈ølation. The ≈øame may be ≈øaid of Dryden's Virgil, if you wi≈øh to ta≈øte the exqui≈øite richne≈øs of the≈øe ancient authors.</p>
                     <p>Ma≈øon's poems have great merit, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him a con≈øiderable celebrity. His Carac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus, his Elfrida, and his Engli≈øh Garden have all been admired. Nothing, however, from his pen, has plea≈øed me more, than the epitaph upon his lady. His talents ≈øeem to be particularly formed for the pen≈øive and pathetic. But poetry, after all, is but an <hi>embelli≈øhment,</hi> and, in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>divine,</hi> a very ≈øecondary di≈øtinction. How much more important and u≈øeful to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are the labours of that pa≈øtor, who, by one judicious, impa≈ø≈øioned and well directed di≈øcour≈øe, appals the ≈øinner, encourages the faint, revives the drooping, guides the perplexed, or conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcends to cheer the bed of ≈øickne≈øs with divine con≈øolations!</p>
                     <p>This remark, however, is not particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to depreciate the ingenious author of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractacus. He is ≈øaid to excel likewi≈øe, as a preacher.</p>

                     <p>IN poetry, the <hi>ladies</hi> have, of late, a≈ø≈øerted their claim to genius, and the trampled honours of their under≈øtanding. Several of them appear, in the walks of Parna≈ø≈øus, with con≈øiderable lu≈øtre.</p>
                     <p>Mi≈øs Seward, in my idea, is a ≈øtar of the fir≈øt magnitude in the hemi≈øphere of imagination. She has given us chiefly little, fugitive pieces; a monody on the death of captain Cook, and major Andre; a poem to the memory of lady Miller, and a few ≈øtanzas to Mr. Wright, on taking her father's picture. The la≈øt always gave me the highe≈øt plea≈øure. It required indeed no great effort, but is a mo≈øt plea≈øing ≈øpecimen of filial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and of a rich, fervid, glowing imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Her Loui≈øa, though her large≈øt, is not, in my idea, her <hi>happie≈øt</hi> performance. A novel is too much dignified by the charms of poetry. It is a courte≈øan, dre≈ø≈øed like a queen.</p>
                     <p>Whenever Mi≈øs Hannah More takes up her pen, ≈øhe never lo≈øes ≈øight of piety and virtue. Her Bleeding rock, Search after Happine≈øs, Sir Eldred of the Bower, Sacred Dramas, Female Fables, &amp;c. will plea≈øe and in≈øtruct you. The little tract, lately publi≈øhed, intitled, "Thoughts on the Manners of the Great," which has had ≈øo very exten≈øive a circulation, is ≈øaid to have come from her ingenious pen. The de≈øign is excellent, and the execution di≈øplays a con≈øiderable knowledge of human life and manners. I wi≈øh it may leave ≈øome la≈øting impre≈ø≈øions. But alas! the di≈ø≈øipated have few intervals for reflection.</p>

Mi≈øs Williams bids fair for a poetic laurel, that ≈øhall long be green. Her Peru, is awork of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable merit.</p>
                     <p>The little ≈øonnets of Mi≈øs Charlotte Smith are ≈øoft, pen≈øive, ≈øentimental and pathetic, as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's productions ≈øhould be. The mu≈øes, if I mi≈øt ake not, will, in time, rai≈øe her to a con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eminence. She has, <hi>as yet,</hi> ≈øtepped forth only in little things, with a diffidence that is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteri≈øtic of real genius in its <hi>fir≈øt</hi> attempts. Her next, public entre may be more in ≈øtyle, and more con≈øequential.</p>
                     <p>The Comte≈ø≈øe le Genlis I have before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a woman of a fine ta≈øte, and a cultivated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding. Her <hi>Theatre ≈øur l'Education,</hi> as found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a <hi>dramatic</hi> plan, may be recommended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt other poetical productions. There is not a ≈øweeter ro≈øe in the garden of <hi>nature,</hi> than hers of Salency.</p>
                     <p>Lord Lyttleton was not, by any means, a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal poet. There is, however, ≈øuch a delicacy, ≈øoftne≈øs, piety, and tender pathos in his ≈øtrains, as do the highe≈øt credit to his <hi>own</hi> heart, and mu≈øt improve that of every attentive reader. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nody upon his Lucy has immortalized his ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, his affection, and his virtue.</p>
                     <p>Aken≈øide's work on the Plea≈øures of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, needs no other recommendation, than what it has received from a generous and a di≈øcerning public. It is highly intere≈øting; it required a very con≈øiderable effort, and his genius has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it beautifully picture≈øque.</p>
                     <p>Cowper's poems are calculated to do con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ≈øervice. He has made the mu≈øes hand-maids to religion. He has cho≈øen ver≈øes, only as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle

His ≈øtyle is ≈øimple, bold, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ≈øpirited and energetic, his judgment, ≈øtrong and penetrating; his metaphors, forcible and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily conceived; his ob≈øervations on life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, accurate, and his ≈øatire, ju≈øt and poignant.</p>
                     <p>He does not ≈øeem ≈øo much to have ≈øtudied the production of a poem, with unity for its de≈øign, and harmony in all its parts, as to ≈øerve the cau≈øe of piety and virtue by general, de≈øultory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øioned reflexions. His work on the whole, is a ≈øtrong ≈øpecimen of genius and talents; rigid critici≈øm, perhaps, would ≈øay, that his piety wants a little mildne≈øs, and ≈øeems to breathe the ≈øpirit of a party.</p>
                     <p>But the mo≈øt fini≈øhed poet of the age is Hayley. His E≈ø≈øay on Hi≈øtory and on Epic Poetry, his Ode to Howard, and his Triumphs of Temper have received very great and very general applau≈øe.</p>

                     <p>YOUR que≈øtion is a very proper one, and I will give you the be≈øt ≈øatisfaction in my power.</p>
                     <p>Pronunciation or that part of grammar, called <hi>Orthoepy,</hi> as to any uncommon or difficult words, is governed by the quantity, which tho≈øe words have in the <hi>original</hi> language, from which they are derived. As you cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:023176_0137_0FBDE15464239258"/>the dead languages, you will of cour≈øe, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, be at a lo≈øs how to pronounce many words with propriety. The only method is recour≈øe to a dictionary, and the be≈øt in my opinion, are tho≈øe of Sheridan and John≈øon. Pronunciation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is a very fluctuating thing; and though there certainly is a ≈øtandard of propriety, over which mere fa≈øhion <hi>ought</hi> to have no power, yet I ≈øhould always recommend a conformity to the manners of the polite≈øt people you may happen to conver≈øe with, rather than a pedantic affectation of gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ≈øtrictne≈øs. The latter would be thought a <hi>conceited</hi> o≈øtentation of knowledge, which, in a young lady, would not be forgiven.</p>
                     <p>The allu≈øions to Jupiter, Pallas, Venus, the Graces, the Mu≈øes, Helicon, Parna≈ø≈øus, which have ≈øo much puzzled you in the poets you have lately read, will be fully explained in Tooke's Pantheon, or Hi≈øtory of the Heathen Gods. The <hi>general</hi> fact is, that before the knowledge of the true God dawned on their minds, the≈øe poor, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant heathens never dreamed of <hi>one</hi> omnipotent, all ≈øufficient, all pervading ≈øpirit, which the ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have revealed, and de≈øcribed, as po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of all po≈ø≈øible perfections. They, therefore, formed to them≈øelves a <hi>multiplicity</hi> of gods, and attributed to one of them in particular, with a <hi>≈øpecific</hi> name, every great quality or ≈øuperior excellence, that appeared beyond the ability of <hi>mortals.</hi> The≈øe deities they arranged into different cla≈ø≈øes, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ≈øuppo≈øed degrees of pre-eminence; and fancied ≈øome of them to inhabit the heavens, and others, the woods, groves, rivers, ≈øprings, mountains, &amp;c.</p>

You will be amu≈øed with their fanciful opinions; and if you think aright, you will learn to ble≈øs the Almighty, on your knees, for having ca≈øt <hi>your</hi> lot in an age and country, where the go≈øpel has di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øed the≈øe mi≈øts and errors, dignified our views and nature beyond all expre≈ø≈øion, and given us the cleare≈øt knowledge of our duty.

Authors wi≈øh to be <hi>read,</hi> and this is the ≈øort of work, which, if judiciou≈øly executed, ≈øuits every ta≈øte. It has a tendency to enlarge the mind, and dive≈øt it of illiberal prejudices. Books of this kind are now become ≈øo numerous, that the difficulty only is how to make the ≈øelection.</p>
                     <p>I will begin with Moore, for he has plea≈øed univer≈øally. Your collection will be graced by his View of Society and Manners in France,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023176_0142_0FBDE15BE55EC5C0"/>Switzerland, and Germany, in two volumes, and his View of Society in Italy, in two more.</p>
                     <p>Wraxall is another writer in this way, who has ≈øuperior merit. He has publi≈øhed a tour through the northern parts of Europe, and through France.</p>
                     <p>Pennant has been ≈øingularly happy in all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. He intere≈øts the antiquarian, the ≈øcholar and the man of genius in his various productions. His works are numerous. A Tour through Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Voyages to the Hebrides, a Tour in North Wales; a Journey to Snowdon; and a Journey from Che≈øter to London, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Switzerland is one of tho≈øe, <hi>romantic</hi> countries, that delights us in idea. Coxe has given ≈øketches of it, in a very plea≈øing and picture≈øque manner.</p>
                     <p>Sherlock's Engli≈øh Traveller is a very original and entertaining book. The author is evidently a man of fanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and genius, but rather ful≈øome in his panegyries on particular characters, and excentric both in his ≈øentiments and manner. He will, ≈øometimes, make you ≈ømile with egoti≈øms and the appearance of conceit; but he will likewi≈øe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten your under≈øtanding.</p>
                     <p>Cordiner's Antiquities and Scenery of the North of Scotland is an entertaining work. The plates annexed to it, plea≈øe the eye, and invigorate the imagination.</p>
                     <p>A tour to the lakes is become very fa≈øhionable, and is ≈øaid abundantly to repay the travellers cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio≈øity. We≈øt's de≈øcription of them may be u≈øeful, though the language appears too florid and poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
                     <p>The Tour to Ermenonville I have never ≈øeen; but it is mentioned as po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing con≈øiderable merit. Gilpin's De≈øcription of the River Wye abounds
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:023176_0143_0FBDE15D66004198"/>with beautiful ≈øcenery, and is a mo≈øt lively and entertaining production.</p>
                     <p>But the catalogue would be endle≈øs. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand, other books of this kind, are at hand, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are di≈øpo≈øed to travel with them in your clo≈øet.</p>
                     <p>If you have a little knowledge of Heraldry, it will be an <hi>embelli≈øhment;</hi> an agreeable exerci≈øe of your ta≈øte and ingenuity, and may, occa≈øionally, ≈øugge≈øt a channel, through which you may ≈øerve a valuable friend. The only books I recollect, are the Elements of it, by Porney; Gwillim, a large folio, and Edmond≈øon's Complete Body of it; in two volumes.</p>
                     <p>But after all this recommendation of different ≈øtudies, do not mi≈øtake me. I do not want to make you a fine writer, an hi≈øtorian, a naturali≈øt, a geographer, an a≈øtronomer, a poet, a painter, a connoi≈ø≈øeur, or a virtuo≈øo of any kind. But I would have you to po≈ø≈øe≈øs ≈øuch a <hi>general</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as will u≈øefully and innocently fill up your lei≈øure hours, rai≈øe your ta≈øte above fanta≈øtic levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, render you an agreeable friend and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, qualify you for the ≈øolid duties of y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="135" facs="unknown:023176_0144_0FBDE15EE333B800"/>needle-work, embroidery, &amp;c. drawing, mu≈øic, dancing, dre≈øs, politene≈øs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To wield the needle with advantage, ≈øo as to unite the u≈øeful and beautiful, is her <hi>particular</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and a ≈øort of ingenuity, which ≈øhews her in the mo≈øt amiable and attracting point of view.‚Äî Solomon de≈øcribes his excellent daughter, as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the labours of the di≈øtaff or the needle. Homer paints his lovely matrons as engaged in ≈øuch dome≈øtic avocations. Andromache is thus relieving her ≈øolitude, when ≈øhe is ≈øurpri≈øed into tran≈øport by the unexpected return of Hector from the war.</p>
                     <p>The heart glows with plea≈øure, when we read the accounts of the good Roman matrons in the purer and unvitiated ages of their republic. The greate≈øt men, princes, warriors, ≈øenators and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers were clothed in the labours of their wives and daughters. Indu≈øtry in this happy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, was e≈øteemed a virtue, and it was not beneath a woman of the fir≈øt quality or under≈øtanding to be an excellent economi≈øt, who <q>looked well to the ways of her hou≈øehold.</q>

                     <p>Employment is the grand pre≈øervative of health and innocence. When we have nothing to do, we immediately become a <hi>burden</hi> to our≈øelves; the mind and body langui≈øh for want of exerci≈øe, and we fall into a thou≈øand dangerous temptations.</p>

The pa≈ø≈øions of mankind, however, have very much deba≈øed and <hi>profaned</hi> this art, which, like others was <hi>originally</hi> ≈øacred, and intended to chant the prai≈øes of the Almighty. Many ≈øongs are couched in ≈øuch <hi>indelicate</hi> language, and convey ≈øuch a train of <hi>lu≈øcious</hi> ideas, as are only calculated to ≈øoil the purity of a <hi>youthful</hi> mind. I ≈øhould therefore recommend, (if I may ≈øo expre≈øs my≈øelf,) rather the <hi>≈øacred,</hi> than the <hi>profane,</hi> of this ≈øtudy.‚Äî Indeed church mu≈øic is, in it≈øelf, more delightful than any other. What can be ≈øuperror to ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages of Judas Maccabaeus, or the Me≈ø≈øiah?‚Äî There is not, perhaps, an higher among≈øt the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi> plea≈øures than a funeral dirge.</p>
                     <p>Dancing, in a degree, is profe≈ø≈øedly an e≈ø≈øential part of a good education, as correcting any <hi>awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardne≈øs</hi> of ge≈øture, giving an ea≈øy and <hi>graceful</hi> motion to the body, and if practi≈øed <hi>early,</hi> perhaps even in <hi>directing</hi> its growth. Modern manners, however, have carried the fondne≈øs for this accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhment to an <hi>immoderate</hi> extreme. A pa≈ø≈øion for making the be≈øt figure in a minuet, is va≈øtly beneath the dignity of a woman's under≈øtanding. And I am not ≈øure, whether <hi>excelling</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular does not in≈øpire too great a fondne≈øs for di≈ø≈øipating plea≈øures, and proportionably abate the ardour for more retired virtues. A woman, who can ≈øparkle and engage the admiration of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery beholder, at a birth night or a ball, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways content with the graver office of managing a family, or the ≈øtill and ≈øober innocence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me≈øtic ≈øcenes. Be≈øides dancing is not, at <hi>certain</hi> moments, without its temptations. An elegant, illuminated room, brilliant company, the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers of mu≈øic, admiring eyes, ob≈øequious
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:023176_0147_0FBDE16366277C90"/>beaus, attitude, &amp;c. are apt to tran≈øport the mind a little beyond the rational medium of <hi>gentle</hi> agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>I would not, however, be a <hi>cynical</hi> morali≈øt, that would abridge you of any harmle≈øs amu≈øement.

                     <p>Some ladies, who were remarkably attentive to their per≈øons <hi>before</hi> marriage, neglect them <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> in an egregious manner.

If they conceived ≈øome efforts nece≈ø≈øary to <hi>gain</hi> the prize, more, I am ≈øure, are required to pre≈øerve it.</p>
                     <p>It is the opinion of (I believe,) Rochefoucault, that nice ob≈øerver of life and manners, that the affection of woman <hi>increa≈øes</hi> after marriage, whil≈øt that of man is apt to <hi>decline.</hi> Whatever be the <hi>cau≈øe,</hi> a prudent woman will, at lea≈øt, u≈øe every method in her power, to guard again≈øt ≈øo <hi>mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> a charge.

                     <p>In the eyes of <hi>≈øervants</hi> and dome≈øtics, indeed, a woman lo≈øes her con≈øequence and authority by a neglect of her per≈øon. She will not be obeyed with <hi>cheerfulne≈øs,</hi> and ≈øhe will become an object of <hi>ridicule,</hi> in all their private parties and conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If inferiors mu≈øt be ≈øubject, they will pay an <hi>uncon≈øtrained</hi> homage only to a per≈øon, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts by <hi>propriety,</hi> the e≈øtimation of the world.</p>

Neatne≈øs is the <hi>natural</hi> garb of a well ordered mind, and has a near alliance with <hi>purity</hi> of heart.

                        <hi>Finery</hi> is ≈øeldom graceful. The ea≈øy undre≈øs of a morning often plea≈øes more, than the mo≈øt ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate and co≈øtly ornaments.

                     <p>A WOMAN may be fairly allowed a little more attention to <hi>ornament,</hi> than would be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the other ≈øex.

We fancy it, in its different <hi>modifications,</hi> a mark of good ≈øen≈øe, delicacy and di≈øcretion, or of the very oppo≈øite defects. Every ≈øen≈øible wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, therefore, will ≈øtudy it ≈øo far, as not to ≈øubject her≈øelf to unfavorable con≈øtructions. She will endeavour to convince every beholder, that ≈øhe knows the proper <hi>medium</hi> betwixt a ridiculous

                        <hi>profu≈øion,</hi> and a total <hi>want,</hi> of ornament; that ≈øhe can ti≈ø≈øue plainne≈øs with elegance; that ≈øhe does not wi≈øh to <hi>≈øeduce</hi> by her appearance, but only to <hi>plea≈øe;</hi> that ≈øhe has cultivated her mind, much more than her per≈øon, and placed the highe≈øt value, not on the <hi>outward,</hi> peri≈øhable <hi>ca≈øket,</hi> but the diamond <hi>within.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I rejoice that the good ≈øen≈øe of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women has corrected ≈øome late <hi>glaring</hi> indecencies of dre≈øs. Young ladies ≈øhould not be <hi>too liberal</hi> in the <hi>di≈øplay</hi> of their charms, Too much <hi>expo≈øure</hi> does not enhance their value. And it approaches, too nearly, to the manner of <hi>tho≈øe</hi> women, whom they would ≈øurely think it no honour to re≈øemble. Bo≈øoms ≈øhould throb <hi>un≈øeen.</hi> The bouffant was an ornament of too <hi>tran≈øparent</hi> a kind. Wherever delicacy throws its mode≈øt drapery, <hi>imagination</hi> always lends inexpre≈ø≈øible charms. As fine a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as the Venus of Medici, would cea≈øe to be admired, if curio≈øity cea≈øed to be <hi>≈øu≈øpended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a great <hi>neatne≈øs</hi> in the dre≈øs of quakers, and of ≈øome other ≈øectaries, who have copied their example. It has, however, more <hi>primne≈øs,</hi> than ea≈øe. In this re≈øpect, you have too much good ≈øen≈øe to affect <hi>≈øingularity.</hi> Religion con≈øi≈øts in ≈øomething more <hi>≈øub≈øtantial,</hi> than any <hi>particular</hi> modes of appearance. And there is, if I mi≈øtake not, ≈øome <hi>conceit</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> under this prodigious, <hi>ever-acted</hi> plainne≈øs. Many, whom the≈øe narrow minded per≈øons would ≈øentence, perhaps to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for being elegantly dre≈ø≈øed, have hearts that overflow with univer≈øal benevolence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more piety and goodne≈øs, than them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>You know what young lady I mean by <hi>Emelia.</hi> I do not know a per≈øon, that dre≈ø≈øes better. She
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023176_0156_0FBDDF4D66569EF8"/>is ≈øingularly happy in her choice of <hi>colours.</hi> Like her virtues they are of the ≈øoft and <hi>≈øhaded</hi> kind, not the brilliant or the gaudy. I never ≈øaw her ≈øine; but ≈øhe never is <hi>fanta≈øtic.</hi> She is ≈øeldom ≈øplendid; but <hi>neatne≈øs</hi> is all her own. If ≈øhe puts on only a ribbon, it is ≈øelected with all the exqui≈øite mode≈øty of her mind, and di≈øpo≈øed of by the hands of ta≈øte. The graces always appear to have been in waiting for the few moments, that ≈øhe ever ≈øuffers dre≈øs to take up her attention.</p>
                     <p>I very much admire the ≈øa≈øhes, which, of late, have been ≈øo fa≈øhionable among≈øt young ladies.‚Äî They give me the idea of a childi≈øh ≈øimplicity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and ea≈øe. The≈øe, and <hi>

If I have not much mi≈øtaken, the be≈øt rules for it will be found in that religion, which requires us <q>to love one another; to be gentle and courteous; to avoid offences; to become <hi>innocently</hi> all things to all men; in honour to prefer one another, and to e≈øteem others better than our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</q>

                     <p>A woman's amu≈øements ≈øhould, as much as po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, be <hi>dome≈øtic;</hi> and her own walls will pre≈øent many excellent opportunities of ≈øuch a nature. The exerci≈øe of parental or filial affection is a ≈øource of <hi>heart-felt</hi> and refined plea≈øure. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes of tenderne≈øs betwixt branches of the ≈øame family, and the little engaging attentions they create, ≈øtimulate the finer movements of the body, and give play to all the refre≈øhing emotions. A <hi>mother,</hi> in particular, mu≈øt have the≈øe <hi>natural</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in <hi>perfection.</hi> Her heart mu≈øt vibrate, with an exqui≈øite ≈øondne≈øs, to the playful graces of a little offspring, and their continually unfolding charms.</p>
                     <p>Exerci≈øe in the open air, is another great amu≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fre≈øh breezes, variety of objects, gentle motion, and all the charming pictures of nature cheer the mind, and invigorate the ≈øpirits. The ≈øedentary life of women is the parent of many fa≈øhionable complaints; weak nerves, low ≈øpirits, vapours, hy≈øterics, languors. <hi>No</hi> con≈øtitution can

                     <p>The ancients paid a very nice attention to the con≈øtitution of females.

                     <p>Attention to a <hi>garden</hi> is truly <hi>feminine</hi> amu≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Our fir≈øt parents are de≈øcribed by Milton, as tending the ≈øhrubs and flowers of their paradi≈øe, with uncea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a≈ø≈øiduity, and as ri≈øing with the dawn to work:</p>

                        <hi>Tea parties</hi> are the <hi>general</hi> mode of ≈øociety, among≈øt ladies.

I will venture to ≈øay, that this ≈øhocking practice is nothing more, than the ≈øpirit of card playing, carried to its <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme;</hi> that equal temptations would probably have led <hi>them</hi> to the very ≈øame imprudence; that they both, <hi>generally,</hi> originate in the ≈øame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (the want of ≈øomething ≈øub≈øtantial to fill and exerci≈øe the mind,) and are only an <hi>artificial</hi> meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of de≈øtroying that <hi>ennui</hi> and languor, which are the mo≈øt in≈øupportable feelings of human life; and that the cure of <hi>both</hi> mu≈øt, equally, ≈øpring from ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid knowledge, and from ≈øolid virtue.</p>
                     <p>Though gaming, at <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> ri≈øes from no wor≈øe a principle, than a want of amu≈øemet, or of having ≈øomething to call the pa≈ø≈øions into exerci≈øe, yet, in its <hi>con≈øequences,</hi> it has a tendency to eradicate every religious and moral di≈øpo≈øition, every ≈øocial
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023176_0171_0FBDDF63E7068250"/>duty, every laudable and virtuous affection. It renders the mind <hi>≈øelfi≈øh</hi> in the extreme, and callous to the touch of woe, in every ≈øhape; whil≈øt it ≈øtops up the <hi>≈øluices</hi> of charity, it extingui≈øhes the <hi>inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for it; it is deaf to every call of friend≈øhip or of prudence. There can be no ≈øuch thing, as an attentive parent, mother, wife, brother, ≈øi≈øter or a ≈øympathizing heart, where this infernal rage has taken po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the ≈øoul. Every thing el≈øe is ≈øwallowed up in the <hi>all-devouring</hi> vortex. A game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter would ≈øtake the la≈øt thou≈øand on a throw, though a <hi>pri≈øon,</hi> for her <hi>hu≈øband, rags</hi> for her <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> or a <hi>gallows</hi> for her neare≈øt <hi>friend,</hi> were the melancholy pro≈øpect!</p>
                     <p>If you di≈øbelieve <hi>this</hi> rea≈øoning, look into life. What effects has this pa≈ø≈øion <hi>gradually</hi> produced on women, who had <hi>once</hi> hearts full of tenderne≈øs and virtue, and were affected with every appearance of di≈øtre≈øs; who had from <hi>nature,</hi> every refinement of ta≈øte, and every elegance of manners to captivate and charm.</p>
                     <p>If it were not invidious, I could produce many <hi>living</hi> characters to ≈øupport my a≈ø≈øertions. They would make a di≈ømal picture, and the motto would be, "beware of beginnings."</p>
                     <p>Though I abhor novels, yet, perhaps, the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated one of Cecilia is worth reading, if it was only to guard our fa≈øhionable ladies from ≈øplitting on the dreadful rock of the Harrels.

                     <p>Without order, a thou≈øand things will be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly delayed, or wholly neglected. Whil≈øt we are he≈øitating where to <hi>begin,</hi> or <hi>what</hi> to do, hours fly away, <hi>in≈øen≈øibly,</hi> never to return!</p>

                     <p>Be always ready to receive your friends with an open countenance, and a cheerful heart. Society and connection have claims upon us, to which we ≈øhould ≈øacrifice every <hi>≈øelfi≈øh</hi> con≈øideration.</p>
                     <p>If you are an <hi>early ri≈øer,</hi> you may ≈øind time for <hi>every</hi> thing. It is amazing how much is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by lopping off an hour or two, from indulgence

                     <p>I have inured my≈øelf, for many years, to this habit of early ri≈øing.

Not that I think a ≈øervile imitation of <hi>any</hi> original, however excellent, would render <hi>another</hi> plea≈øing. Nature no more intended any two per≈øons to have preci≈øely the ≈øame <hi>manner,</hi> than the ≈øame eyes, or features, or complexion. But ≈øtill a <hi>familiar</hi> intimacy with ≈øuch a woman mu≈øt <hi>in≈øen≈øibly</hi> communicate ≈øome traits of re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, which by incorporating with the <hi>general</hi> ma≈øs of a character, will form a beautiful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent whole.</p>
                     <p>Though I have always admired her only in the <hi>gro≈øs,</hi> and was charmed, without con≈øidering the con≈øtituent principles of her excellence, I will, as you reque≈øt it, endeavour to <hi>analyze</hi> and trace them to their ≈øource.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>ground work</hi> of all her charms, is, (what I cannot call by a better name, than that of) ≈øimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; an artle≈øs, unde≈øigning, <hi>un≈øtudied</hi> manner, flowing from an innocent and virtuous heart, which, ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023176_0175_0FBDDF69E512E7E0"/>above mea≈øure, nor ever ridiculou≈øly degrades her≈øelf, in order to be <hi>exalted.</hi> Her ge≈øtures, atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, voice, pronunciation are all under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate impre≈ø≈øion and guidance of <hi>nature.</hi> Loui≈øa <hi>expre≈ø≈øes</hi> an innocent plea≈øure, becau≈øe ≈øhe <hi>feels</hi> it in the company of ≈øen≈øible and agreeable men, and yet never ≈øeeks it with an improper avidity. She never harangues upon, or vaunts a <hi>≈øuperior</hi> ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but frequently di≈øplays no <hi>incon≈øiderable</hi> ≈øhare of it, by <hi>involuntary</hi> emotions. She never, in any re≈øpect, affects connections, appearance or any thing <hi>above</hi> her fortune, nor endeavours to ≈øhine at the expence of others.</p>
                     <p>This, though very imperfectly de≈øcribed, is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my idea, the fir≈øt excellence in the character of this lady. It is the very rever≈øe of that ab≈øurd affectation, which, by a≈ø≈øuming a thou≈øand, <hi>fanciful</hi> ≈øhapes, renders graces unlovely, and even beauty di≈øgu≈øting. Loui≈øa charms every per≈øon, becau≈øe ≈øhe is <hi>always</hi> amiable and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without <hi>≈øtudying</hi> to charm. Her face is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways welcome in company, though ≈øhe throws no <hi>artificial</hi> lightning into her eyes, ≈øoftne≈øs into her features, nor <hi>li≈øping</hi> into her articulation.</p>
                     <p>The common <hi>≈øy≈øtematic</hi> education of girls is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable to this ≈øimplicity. The tendency of <hi>modern</hi> culture is to rai≈øe art, upon the ruins of nature. Such a method would not ≈øucceed in any thing <hi>el≈øe,</hi> and how ≈øhould it in the treatment of women? If there be one object in the world, more di≈øgu≈øting than all others, it is a girl, whom nature formed to be innocent and artle≈øs, reducing affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and di≈øgui≈øe to a <hi>≈øy≈øtem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is with ≈øimplicity of manner, as it is with ea≈øe of ≈øtyle, in a writer. When we read his
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023176_0176_0FBDDF6B65EE1158"/>works, it appears the mo≈øt <hi>ea≈øy</hi> attainment imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but, in fact, nothing is ≈øo <hi>uncommon,</hi> either in conduct or in writings. And the rea≈øon mu≈øt be, that, in≈øtead of attending to the guidance of nature, people make an extraordinary effort to be ≈øomething <hi>great,</hi> or <hi>≈øuperior,</hi> and uncommon. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity may be ≈øtyled the ea≈øy and the graceful <hi>negligence</hi> of conduct, yet, as in dre≈øs, it charms more than the mo≈øt elaborate ornaments.</p>
                     <p>Through all the wonderful works of God there is a maje≈øtic ≈øimplicity. Nature knows no <hi>affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Her pro≈øpects, hills, vallies, alcoves, grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos are all un≈øtudied; her magnificence is wild and artle≈øs. There is a ≈øimplicity of de≈øign and effect in all her wonders, in the con≈øtruction and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of planets, in the flow and ebbing of the tides, and in the vomiting of immen≈øe volcanos. The carnation never aims at the ≈øtately magnificence of the o≈øtentatious hoary oak. Every ro≈øe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with its own natural hues and odours; and affects not the elegant ≈øweetne≈øs of the Re≈øeda, (minionette.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nature</hi> is the ≈øtandard of <hi>perfection.</hi> Every character and every art is only ≈øo far fini≈øhed, as it approaches to her likene≈øs. No paintings are beautiful without this ground-work of <hi>≈øimplicity.</hi> It charms in a Correggio. It was the excellence of a Raphael. It lives in the exqui≈øite touches of a Reynolds.</p>
                     <p>The beauty of all <hi>writing</hi> is founded in ≈øimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. It was with Homer, Virgil and Milton, when they ≈øketched out their inimitable poems. Of Shake≈øpeare it was the very ≈øoul. Statuaries, ≈øculptors, architects have only gained an exten≈øive
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023176_0177_0FBDDF6CE556EA08"/>reputation, in proportion as they have ≈øtudied this <hi>divine</hi> ≈øimplicity.</p>
                     <p>No woman can be graceful without it. It will go further, in the art of plea≈øing, without <hi>any</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhments, than <hi>all</hi> the accompli≈øhments will go, without it.</p>

                     <p>I have often heard Loui≈øa dwell, with rapture, on the entertainment and <hi>edification</hi> ≈øhe has receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many <hi>cottages</hi> when ≈øhe has been carrying clothing, cordials or money to the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and tell me which is the more digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied character? a woman, who would turn from her poor neighbours with di≈ødain, or one, who for her kindne≈øs and attention to them, is prai≈øed, as often as her name is mentioned, and followed, whither≈øoever ≈øhe moveth, with their tears and with their ble≈ø≈øings.</p>
                     <p>There is not a greater charm in any character, than ≈øuch a <hi>conde≈øcen≈øion.</hi> A woman, thus forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all her di≈øtinctions, to ≈øympathize with the unfortunate, mu≈øt captivate every man, who has either a ≈øingle grain of piety or under≈øtanding.

Fortunately for my friend, a comfortable, <hi>pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> fortune, in conjunction with that, which he received with his lady, has placed him in very ea≈øy, and rather affluent, circum≈øtances. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has crowned their virtuous friend≈øhip only with Loui≈øa; but indeed, in her alone, has rained down a <hi>profu≈øion</hi> of its ble≈ø≈øings. In her, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all their cares and anxieties concenter; and her education, you may well ≈øuppo≈øe, has not been neglected.</p>
                     <p>Her parents are both aver≈øe to boarding ≈øchools, as in≈øpiring a young per≈øon with improper notions, and undermining the ta≈øte for pure ≈øimplicity and dome≈øtic worth. She has, therefore, been always kept under their own, immediate in≈øpection; but her hours are as ≈øtrictly arranged, as they could have been, at any ≈øchool, into a <hi>regular</hi> plan of employment. She has her allotted intervals for dome≈øtic duties, needle-work, reading, corre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, exerci≈øe and recreation; and every hour knows its particular engagement.</p>
                     <p>She opens every morning, and clo≈øes every day with an hymn of prai≈øe to her bountiful Creator, which is chanted to the harp≈øichord, with ≈øo ≈øweet a voice, as I cannot even at this di≈øtance of time, recollect without emotion.</p>
                     <p>If you ≈øaw the beautiful <hi>fancy-work,</hi> which has been wrought by this girl, in carpers, ba≈økets of flowers, embroidery, &amp;c. you would imagine, that ≈øhe could have but little lei≈øure for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her under≈øtanding. But a ≈øtrict <hi>economy</hi> of time, an invariable adherence to <hi>order,</hi> and an habit of <hi>early ri≈øing</hi> have enabled her to do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Her father ≈øuperintends that part of her education, which is connected with books; and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023176_0185_0FBDDF78E60D3DD0"/>has ≈øuch an happy method of conveying his idea as wonderfully mixes in≈øtruction with delight.</p>
                     <p>Natural hi≈øtory and botany, on fine days, they ≈øtudy in the <hi>fields;</hi> and when the weather is le≈øs favourable, ≈øhe has ≈øuch a collection of animals, in≈øects, and other curio≈øities as would adorn the mu≈øeum of a connoi≈ø≈øeur. This is called her grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and is placed in a ≈øhady part of the garden, over-arched with an alcove of entwined elms.</p>
                     <p>Hi≈øtory, in the hands of her able in≈øtructor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a fund of un≈øpeakable improvement. When events are recorded, ≈øhe is a≈øked what <hi>cau≈øes</hi> gave them birth; what <hi>in≈øtruments</hi> were made u≈øe of for their completion, and what traces ≈øhe can di≈øcover, of a wonderful and an all-wi≈øe Providence, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole.</p>
                     <p>Geography and chronology are in≈øeparable guides con≈øulted on the occa≈øion; and when <hi>characters</hi> are de≈øcribed, ≈øhe is interrogated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>prai≈øe-worthy</hi> or the <hi>reprehen≈øible,</hi> in them; where the hi≈øtorian has been too ≈øparing of his prai≈øe, or extolled beyond the bounds of rea≈øon and of <hi>truth.</hi> Her ≈øentiments, on all the≈øe ≈øubjects, are given, in her own language, upon paper; and afterwards corrected by the mature judgment and critical ta≈øte of her incomparable tutor.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Sundays,</hi> ≈øhe prepares a conci≈øe abridgment of the ≈øermon, which undergoes the ≈øame rigid examination; and ≈øhe has a little volume, filled with ≈øuch ≈øacred reflections, as would not di≈øhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the under≈øtanding, or the repo≈øitory of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed divine.</p>
                     <p>You would ≈øuppo≈øe from <hi>this</hi> account, that Loui≈øa would appear (what the world calls,) a

In a <hi>mixed</hi> company, you would not di≈øcern, that ≈øhe po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed any ≈øuperior knowledge or advantage over her ≈øex, except in an elegant mode of expre≈ø≈øion. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into other people's views, feelings, intere≈øts and concerns, with a politene≈øs, that very few po≈ø≈øe≈øs; and conver≈øes with all her country neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, on ≈øuch ea≈øy terms, as bani≈øh every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øant feeling of di≈øtance or re≈øtraint.</p>

Into <hi>this,</hi> ≈øhe puts, every night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øhe ≈øleeps, ≈øomething to be a fund for merit and di≈øtre≈øs.

It is filled with money, that others would have ≈øpent on plays, concerts or a≈ø≈øemblies; and I will venture to ≈øay, that ≈øhe has infinitely ≈øweeter mu≈øic in her heart, and a more innocent, ≈øparkling brilliance in her eyes, than any of the mo≈øt admired frequenters of the≈øe gay amu≈øements.</p>

                     <p>The garden is the ≈øcene, where ≈øhe indulges all the luxury of her ta≈øte; and her rambles into it are as frequent, as the great variety of her avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will permit. One day, I found her in this retizement. The place was very happily fancied. Large clumps of trees, on both ≈øides, with their intervening foliage, had rendered it impervious to any human eye. Nature had wantoned with particular luxuriance. A clear, tran≈øparent ≈øpring murmured through the valley. And it was fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on both ≈øides, with a very lofty mound, ca≈øt up as on purpo≈øe, and planted with perennial ≈øhrubs. A ≈øhady arbour, in the middle, catching through a beautiful vi≈øta, the ≈øpire of the village church, invited to meditation and to repo≈øe. She was reclined here rather in a pen≈øive attitude, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Burke's E≈ø≈øays on the Beautiful and Sublime; and to me ≈øhe appeared, I mu≈øt confe≈øs, more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting, more <hi>beautiful</hi> and more <hi>≈øublime,</hi> than the admired work of that well known and admired author.</p>
                     <p>On another occa≈øion, her mother being much indi≈øpo≈øed, ≈øhe had ≈øtolen from the dome≈øtic circle, to indulge, at lei≈øure, a ≈øolitary grief. The book ≈øhe held in her hands, was Lord Lyttleton's Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of the Dead. The ≈øoft melancholy vi≈øible in her countenance, the very apparent agitation of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023176_0188_0FBDDF7D6611E920"/>her ≈øpirits, and the grief, bur≈øting through her animated eyes, formed a very intere≈øting whole; whil≈øt her ob≈øervations on a future life, on the comfort ≈øhe derived from the hope of conver≈øing with her friends after death; on the probable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and happine≈øs of heaven, and the permanency of virtuous friend≈øhip and affection, would no have di≈øgraced any divine or philo≈øopher of the age.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>third</hi> time of her elopement, ≈øhe was reading the only novel, which ≈øhe permits her≈øelf <hi>to</hi> read, that of Sir Charles Grandi≈øon. Tears, like an April ≈øhower, tinged with the ≈øun, were mingled with her joy.</p>
                     <p>The book was opened, where the once-amiable Harriet Byron is <hi>now</hi> Lady Grandi≈øon; where the painful ≈øu≈øpen≈øe of her virtuous, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature, attachment, is crowned by an eternal union with its object, and ≈øhe is kneeling to her ever-venerable grandmother, to implore a ble≈ø≈øing. "Heavens!" (≈øaid ≈øhe,) <q>what an exqui≈øite and inimitable painter was Richard≈øon! How over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whemled with admiration, e≈øteem and ≈øelf-annihilation do I, always, feel my≈øelf, when I read the de≈øcription of his Harriet Byron.

                        <hi>pains</hi> to plea≈øe, mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily have charmed every beholder.</p>
                     <p>How long will it be before people learn, that nothing engages ≈øo much, as the ea≈øe of nature? An artle≈øs <hi>≈øimplicity</hi> is the highe≈øt charm. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>≈øludies</hi> admiration, rai≈øes di≈øgu≈øt. Sy≈øtem and con≈øtraint de≈øtroy <hi>ea≈øe.</hi> And ea≈øe is the parent of all the graces.</p>
                     <p>It is the bu≈øine≈øs of education to lop off ≈øome little, <hi>luxuriant</hi> boughs from the tree of nature, but not to <hi>con≈øtrain</hi> it, that it cannot vegetate, or give to every branch, an <hi>unnatural</hi> direction. I ≈øhould prefer the plain, hone≈øt awkwardne≈øs of a more country girl to over-acted refinement.</p>
                     <p>Though Lady Harriet‚Äîis not yet four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, ≈øhe has more than the airs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardne≈øs of a woman. Who can have taught this girl, that ro≈øes are expected to open <hi>all at once,</hi> and not by degrees?</p>
                     <p>Timidity and diffidence are the mo≈øt attracting qualities of a girl; a countenance always mode≈øt, and unde≈øigning; a tongue, often ≈øilent, and ears, always attentive.</p>

                     <p>It is de≈øirable, that a girl ≈øhould retain, as long as po≈ø≈øible, the innocent dre≈øs, manners, habit and ≈øentiments of childhood. She will never be more captivating, when ≈øhe is a woman. Natural,

Nature has given to every <hi>age,</hi> as well as to every <hi>≈øea≈øon</hi> of the year, its <hi>appropriate</hi> charms.

                     <p>A <hi>forward</hi> girl always alarms me. Indelicacy, imprudence and improper connections ≈øtart up to my view. I tremble for her friends, and ≈øee her hi≈øtory, <hi>gradually,</hi> unfolding into indi≈øcretion.</p>
                     <p>Children are apt enough, of <hi>them≈øelves,</hi> to a≈øpire into womanhood. A governe≈øs ≈øhould <hi>check</hi> this ≈øpirit, and nip it in the bud.

When ≈øhe fancies her≈øelf a woman, company, plea≈øures and conver≈øation with the other ≈øex, <hi>unhinge</hi> her mind, and bid unquiet thoughts take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of her fancy.</p>
                     <p>I could di≈øcover from the conver≈øation of Lady Harriet, that ≈øhe was deeply read in novels and romances. Her expre≈ø≈øions were beyond nature, turgid and over≈øtrained, where ≈øhe only wi≈øhed to convey a <hi>common</hi> idea.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>volume</hi> would not be ≈øufficient to expo≈øe the dangers of the≈øe books.

                        <salute>MY DEAR LUCY,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I GAVE you a de≈øcription of the <hi>true</hi> delicacy of Loui≈øa. I have lately ≈øeen it over-acted by <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> per≈øon, in ≈øuch a manner, as to di≈øgu≈øt me beyond expre≈ø≈øion. The virtues and graces have
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023176_0198_0FBDDF8C672214E8"/>all their limits. If pu≈øhed further, they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into the very oppo≈øite defects. The lady, who hurt my feelings, had not <hi>con≈øidered</hi> this max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im. Or ≈øhe had not ta≈øte and ≈øen≈øe enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it. <hi>Her</hi> delicacy was ab≈øolute <hi>prudery and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True delicacy is nothing more, than the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>mode≈øty.</hi> It is the ≈øen≈øitive plant of woman, which gives the quicke≈øt notice of approaching danger, and trembles at the bare <hi>apprehen≈øion</hi> of any thing, which can injure her honour, her ≈øafety, or repo≈øe. So amiable in it≈øelf, one cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that every female wi≈øhes to be thought in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it. But it is a ≈øhy and timid plant, and lea≈øt di≈øplays it≈øelf, where it is known to exi≈øt in the highe≈øt cultivation.</p>
                     <p>Some women are ≈øo <hi>over-loaden</hi> with this virtue, as to be almo≈øt in≈øufferable in ≈øociety; ≈øo <hi>outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly</hi> virtuous, that they render all their purity and principles ≈øu≈øpected.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>tremblingly</hi> mode≈øt female, in a company, of which I had lately the honour of making one, on hearing that a number of gentlemen were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drink tea, ≈øeemed very much alarmed, and pretended to make an apology for retiring. Now this was nothing le≈øs than downright <hi>hypocri≈øy.</hi> If it had been po≈ø≈øible to look into her heart, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, at the very moment, it was thrilling with joy, for the agreable information.</p>
                     <p>Every woman in the world is fond of our ≈øocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unle≈øs ≈øhe had formed ≈øome <hi>particular</hi> attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wi≈øhes to indulge the greater luxury of ≈øolitary recollection. It is a <hi>natural</hi> and an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>a≈øure, and it would be the <hi>fal≈øe≈øt</hi> delicacy to di≈øown it. We always <hi>≈øu≈øpect</hi> the≈øe prudes.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023176_0199_0FBDDF8DE5157050"/>We fancy, that their mode≈øty dimini≈øhes in private in proportion, as it appears to dilate and to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify it≈øelf, before the public in≈øpection.</p>
                     <p>Upon hearing, again, that a young lady had been ≈ømart and lively with a gentleman of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, ≈øhe <hi>ble≈ø≈øed her ≈øtars,</hi> and wondered, how ≈øuch forwardne≈øs e≈øcaped <hi>reprobation!</hi> Now this girl acted from <hi>nature.</hi> The gentleman was agreeable. She felt the plea≈øure. She dared to expre≈øs it. She wi≈øhed to entertain him, and ≈øhe did right. The other blamed her from envy or from affectation.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe <hi>over-nice</hi> and <hi>over-virtuous</hi> people would do well to con≈øider, that an odious re≈øtraint would bani≈øh all the ≈øweets of an intercour≈øe betwixt the ≈øexes, and fix a moping and a di≈ømal gloom on the face of the creation. It is no breach of true deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to comply with the innocent dictates of <hi>nature.</hi> A woman may, very mode≈øtly, avow a virtuous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. She may expre≈øs an approbation of particular men, and do ju≈øtice to their merit. She may ≈øhew a fondne≈øs for being in their company. She may chat, in a ≈øociable and an ea≈øy manner with them; nay ≈øhe may think of being a <hi>wife</hi> or a <hi>mother,</hi> without injuring the fine≈øt tints of this laudable quality. Providence intended her for ≈øuch circum≈øtances and connections, and they need not a <hi>blu≈øh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>piety</hi> is mo≈øt ≈øolid, which affects no gloomy rigours, or ≈øingularities; which makes no noi≈øe, and courts no ob≈øervation. It is ≈øo with delicacy. <hi>That</hi> is <hi>always</hi> the mo≈øt exqui≈øite, which is lea≈øt <hi>o≈øtentatious.</hi> An <hi>un≈øtudied</hi> openne≈øs and ≈øimplicity of manners are the ≈øtronge≈øt ≈øymptoms of a guiltle≈øs heart, and a virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023176_0200_0FBDDF8F6580BD10"/>people are, generally the mo≈øt amiable, that are mo≈øt undi≈øgui≈øed. Having nothing to <hi>conceal,</hi> they have ≈øtudied no <hi>art.</hi> They may, <hi>≈øometimes,</hi> give way to little ≈øallies, which the <hi>rigid</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn; but they are ≈øallies of good <hi>humour,</hi> and genero≈øity forgives them.</p>
                     <p>Another in≈øtance, in which this Lady offended me, and yet from an <hi>over</hi> de≈øire of plea≈øing, was by a≈ø≈øuming a mi≈øtaken dignity. In fact, true dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in any per≈øon, con≈øi≈øts in the <hi>virtues;</hi> humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, conde≈øcen≈øion, candour; and is only ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>great</hi> qualities, or by a train of amiable actions. But in a <hi>woman's</hi> manner, if ≈øhe con≈øid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered only what is <hi>graceful,</hi> there ≈øhould always be more of the lovely, than the great; of the enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, than the magnificent or ≈øublime. Her <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> ≈øhould be lo≈øt in <hi>≈øweetne≈øs;</hi> the dazzling, in the mild.</p>
                     <p>Women were not formed to <hi>awe</hi> us by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty, but to <hi>≈øooth</hi> us by their graces. We may be ≈øtruck with a Cleopatra, but we <hi>love</hi> an Antiope. A Catharine may <hi>a≈øtoni≈øh</hi> us, but we are <hi>charmed</hi> with a ‚Äî C ‚Äî e.</p>

                     <p>THE tour of affectation is unbounded. I have ju≈øt returned from a circle of ladies, who have been entertaining me with a very long harangue, on (what they choo≈øe to call,) <hi>fine feelings.</hi> This is quite a fa≈øhionable ≈øubject. The truth is, ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023176_0201_0FBDDF90E53D7A50"/>is con≈øidered, as a matter of refinement, and a proof of being rai≈øed above the vulgar; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young people, I do believe, would be more hurt by any reflection on their ≈øen≈øibility, than if you ≈øu≈øpected their piety and virtue.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>rage</hi> for the compliment of fine feelings ≈øeems to have originated in the writings of Sterne. His very eccentric talents were always contriving ≈øome fictitious tale of woe, and bidding the tear to drop; the general circulation of his works, and the novels which have, ≈øince, ≈øprung up in the <hi>hot-bed</hi> of France, and of our own <hi>imaginations,</hi> have led young people to fancy every grace and almo≈øt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtue, comprized under this ≈øpecious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øive name.</p>
                     <p>Nothing certainly can be more nau≈øeous and di≈øgu≈øting, than an <hi>affected</hi> ≈øen≈øibility, as nothing is more charming, than the pure and genuine. But, with all this <hi>noi≈øe</hi> about it, I am far from knowing whether there is much of the real in the world. They, who would be thought to have it in perfection, are only in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the <hi>artificial.</hi> For is it ≈øen≈øibility to prefer the turbid plea≈øures of <hi>midnight</hi> to opening buds and blo≈ø≈øoms; to the le≈ø≈øons, which the Creator gives in every vegetable and every in≈øect; to undi≈øturbed contemplation; to the raptures of devotion, or all the fair and enchanting land≈øcapes of creation; to the ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ta≈øte and knowledge, that are di≈øplayed in the works of the mo≈øt learned and ingenious men, or the entertainment and delight and profit, we might receive from the volume of revelation? Is it ≈øen≈øibility to form a ≈øacred connection with one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and encourage a criminal attachment to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Is it ≈øen≈øibility to leave the charms, the cries, the wants and tender pleadings of an infant offs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023176_0202_0FBDDF9265246C40"/>for the vain and peri≈øhable ≈øplendour of a ball, a birth-night, or a levee?</p>
                     <p>Every <hi>thinking</hi> per≈øon mu≈øt be di≈øgu≈øted with <hi>≈øuch</hi> a kind of ≈øen≈øibility. Rigid critici≈øm would call it by a very har≈øh name, and ≈øociety has rea≈øon to reprobate its tendency. Yet Sterne's ≈øen≈øibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty led to many of the≈øe evils; and who knows not, that a thou≈øand ladies, who <hi>vaunt fine</hi> feelings, are dupes to this ridiculous illu≈øion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>True</hi> feeling is of a very different complexion. Like genius, it mu≈øt come from <hi>heaven;</hi> indeed it is a part <hi>of</hi> genius; and, like that, is very rare. It depends, con≈øiderably on temperament and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization; is much heightened by particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of education, ≈øociety, friends, reading. ob≈øervation and reflection; and will generally be quicke≈øt in the mo≈øt elevated minds. But, even when it is mo≈øt gennine and poignant, it will never be a guide, ≈øafely to be tru≈øted, till it is governed by rea≈øon, checked by di≈øcretion, and moulded by that religion, which requires us to devote every <hi>in≈øtinct</hi> we have, to the glory of God, and to the happine≈øs of all our fellow-creatures, and of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>con≈øecrated,</hi> it is a ≈øource of the pure≈øt and the riche≈øt ble≈ø≈øings. It is the parent of an earne≈øt devotion to him, who gave it, and of a thou≈øand ble≈ø≈øings to mankind. It <hi>appropriates</hi> all the ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of its brethren; it feels in every woe, <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices with them, that do rejoice, and weeps with them that weep;</q> and doubly alive to all the exerci≈øes, of piety, in blo≈ø≈øoms, in flowers, in minerals, in vegetables, in ≈øtars, in planets, in the azure vault of heaven, in thunders, in ≈øtorms, in earthquakes, in volcanos, in the revolutions of

                     <p>It is with this, as with every other grace and virtue. There is a fal≈øe and a true. The fal≈øe is loud and noi≈øy, much addicted to <hi>egoti≈øm,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes it≈øelf on public ob≈øervation in order to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify its own conceit and vanity; the other, mode≈øt, timid, retired <hi>≈øhrinks</hi> into it≈øelf; feels, but ≈øays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its feelings; ≈øuffers, but conceals its ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; rejoices, but does not vaunt its joy, and is too <hi>delicate</hi> in its nature, and too much <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øted</hi> to ≈øolicit pity, or to court approbation. The one is an humble fire work, which cracks an ≈øparkles; the other is that lightning, which, in an <hi>in≈øtant,</hi> electrifies and ≈øhocks; this is the offs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring of heaven; that, the artificial creature of the world.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude this letter with a contra≈øt taken from life. Flavia lies in bed till noon; as ≈øoon as ≈øhe ri≈øes, ≈øhe opens a novel, or a play-book; weeps profu≈øely at <hi>imaginary</hi> di≈øtre≈øs, ≈øips ≈øtrong tea, till ≈øhe is almo≈øt in hy≈øterics; concludes, that ≈øen≈øibility is all her own, and is perpetually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining how her feelings are ≈øhocked with ≈øuch a room, or ≈øuch a pro≈øpect, the coar≈øene≈øs of <hi>this</hi> character, and of <hi>that</hi> conver≈øation, and how the ≈øight of a poor beggar gives her the <hi>vapours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Emily never ≈øays a word about her feelings, ri≈øes with the dawn, endeavours to fortify her body with air and exerci≈øe, and her mind with devotion; is oftener ≈øeen with her <hi>bible,</hi> than any other book; ≈øeems plea≈øed with every per≈øon and every object about her, and puts on a cheerful ≈ømile, when her

                     <p>I WILL give you candidly, at your reque≈øt, my opinion of ≈øome celebrated writers.

                     <p>Voltaire is a graceful, but a <hi>≈øuperficial</hi> writer. He had more ta≈øte than genius, and more liveline≈øs than authenticity. Volatile in his re≈øearches, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023176_0205_0FBDDF96E5411FE8"/>of inve≈øtigation and ha≈øty in his deci≈øions, you can ≈øcarcely rely on the truth or authority of any facts, he relates.</p>

                     <p>Rou≈ø≈øeau is very fanciful, but very engaging. His whims are all the ebullitions of genius; and, as ≈øuch, they plea≈øe. Nothing was ever ≈øo ≈øtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly romantic, as his Emilius, or ≈øy≈øtem of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a mere, <hi>paper</hi> edifice of children, which the fir≈øt and gentle≈øt touch of experience totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroys.

                     <p>But Voltaire was a <hi>congenial</hi> writer, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial ≈øoul. In prai≈øing his <hi>≈øuperficial</hi> talents, Che≈øterfield did an honour to his own.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023176_0210_0FBDDF9E65AC2A40"/>and <hi>energy</hi> of the ancients. Richard≈øon was a ≈øtranger to the inimitable models of Greece and Rome. He was not a <hi>cla≈ø≈øic;</hi> but he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed a mo≈øt exten≈øive knowledge of human life and manners; his judgment was ≈øtrong and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; his ta≈øte, accurate; his ≈øen≈øibility, exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite; his imagination, wonderful; and his heart, impa≈ø≈øioned. Ma≈øter of the human character, he knew all its <hi>meandrings.</hi> Ma≈øter of the human ≈øoul, he penetrated into all its foldings and rece≈ø≈øes.</p>
                     <p>With the ≈øame breath, and in the ≈øame moment, he melts, he tran≈øports, he elevates, he dignifies, he convinces, and in≈øtructs. Pathos is all his own. <q>He opens the harde≈øt rocks by the mere force of his narrative, and the waters flow.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Richard≈øon was, indeed, a writer of no trifling magnitude. He was a genius of no ordinary kind. Degrade this <hi>ethereal</hi> ≈øpirit, as you will, it will mount up to its kindred ≈økies. Call him a <hi>noveli≈øt,</hi> his merit ri≈øes above names and forms. <hi>The≈øe</hi> cannot deba≈øe his talents. Handle this ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, as roughly as you plea≈øe, it returns, with an ela≈øtic vigour, to its u≈øual ≈øhape, and defies oppo≈øition.</p>
                     <p>But the excellency of his <hi>intention</hi> is above all prai≈øe. The intere≈øts of virtue and religion were near his heart; and he cho≈øe the epi≈øtolatory plan merely to engage the attention of his readers, and that imagination might lend its livelie≈øt charms to <hi>animate</hi> his precepts.</p>
                     <p>What a pattern of all virtues and graces is his Grandi≈øon! What a lovely and fini≈øhed girl, is his Harriet Byron! What an unruffled piety! What a melting affection! What filial duty to her aged grandmother? What a kind ≈øympathy
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:023176_0211_0FBDDF9FE53B6710"/>with all her friends! What ≈øen≈øibility, yet what prudence! What tenderne≈øs, yet what di≈øcretion appear in her character!

How fondly does ≈øhe love, yet how delicately does ≈øhe manage and regulate the flame!</p>
                     <p>When ≈øhe pined, in ≈øecret, with an unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attachment, what cheerfulne≈øs to all her friends bur≈øt through the heavy gloom, that lowered on her mind! What fear of giving any pain to others, though comfortle≈øs her≈øelf! What veneration did ≈øhe expre≈øs for the unhappy Clementina! What a generous concern for the innocent, girli≈øh emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Emily!

                     <p>How venerable and engaging has this writer made the character of a clergyman, in the ca≈øe of Dr. Bartlett!

                     <p>In oppo≈øition to modern cu≈øtoms, which, under a <hi>fal≈øe</hi> idea of greatne≈øs, would trample on ≈øacred ceremonies, and bring the holy ordinances of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to their own <hi>fire-≈øides,</hi> in a manner, which dive≈øts them of all ≈øolemnity and decorum, what an invincible attachment does his Grandi≈øon di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play to all the <hi>decencies</hi> and duties of the church! What a reluctance does he expre≈øs again≈øt having his marriage <hi>de≈øecrated</hi> by a <hi>private</hi> celebration; and how does he oblige his timid and his blu≈øhing Harriet to vow at the <hi>altar,</hi> in the pre≈øence of God, and in the face of day, her obedience, and her affection! In fact the≈øe outward <hi>decencies</hi> are the very fences of piety. Break them down, and the ≈øacred enclo≈øure will ≈øoon become <q>common and unclean.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>If, in ≈øhort, I wi≈øhed a girl to be every thing, that was <hi>great,</hi> I would have her continually ≈øtudy his Clari≈ø≈øa.

                     <p>I mu≈øt, however, confe≈øs a ≈øtrong preference for the work of Sir Charles Grandi≈øon. The read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Clari≈ø≈øa leaves, upon the mind, too melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly impre≈ø≈øions. Her di≈øtre≈ø≈øes are too deep and too <hi>unvaried</hi> for ≈øen≈øibility to bear. She was every thing, that was virtuous, and we look up with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. She was every thing, that was mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we look <hi>down</hi> with de≈øpair. We are tempted to fancy, that <q>there is no reward for the righteous, nor any God that judgeth the earth.</q>

There is a certain point, <hi>beyond</hi> which our pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions will not bear to be racked. Beyond it even ≈øympathy, the lovelie≈øt of them all, turns into the wildne≈øs of de≈øpair.

                     <p>Mi≈øs Byron is always lovely, and always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting. Her virtues are more within the reach of mortality. Her afflictions are le≈øs poignant; and when her long attachment is crowned with ≈øucce≈øs, every good mind feels a plea≈øure, too big for expre≈ø≈øion.

But what is all this again≈øt his writings? Why people, you ≈øay, are deterred from attempting to imitate ≈øo exalted a pattern.

Is it not a noble and a glorious emulation, at lea≈øt, to exert our <hi>utmo≈øt</hi> ≈øtrength, when we are running the race of immortality?</p>
                     <p>The founder of our holy religion is much more highly rai≈øed above our imitation, and yet do not the ≈øcriptures pre≈øs us to make the nece≈ø≈øary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?

                     <p>Nor do I blu≈øh, on the whole, cautious as I ≈øhould be, to have borne this humble te≈øtimony to the merit of the author of Sir Charles Grandi≈øon, to have offered my unavailing incen≈øe, at his ≈øhrine. If I dur≈øt <hi>preach</hi> in ≈øome ≈øuch manner, I

He has conveyed <hi>indelicate</hi> ideas into the minds of young people, under the ≈øpecious vehicle of ≈øentiment, and he has dignified <hi>eventual</hi> crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality with the fal≈øe, in≈øidious title of <hi>involuntary</hi> attachment. The corrupted and unblu≈øhing fair has gloried in her ≈øhame. She has appealed for her ju≈øtification, from the <hi>gro≈ø≈øne≈øs</hi> of pa≈ø≈øion, to ≈øecret and <hi>irre≈øi≈øtible</hi> feelings of the heart.</p>
                     <p>It is a ju≈øt compliment to the pre≈øent age, that the be≈øt writers pre≈øerve more decorum. An <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicate</hi> allu≈øion would, now, be e≈øteemed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable offence again≈øt the public ta≈øte. Even the <hi>≈øtage</hi> is con≈øiderably reformed. It was far otherwi≈øe in (what was called) our <hi>Augu≈øtan</hi> age. Almo≈øt every author of <hi>that</hi> period (Addi≈øon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,) breathes ≈øomething of indelicacy. In many pa≈ø≈øages, Swift is intolerable; Pope inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and even Bolingbroke, with all his claims to birth, as well as eloquence, is not without ≈øome <hi>gro≈øs</hi> ideas, and ≈øome vulgar expre≈ø≈øions.</p>
                     <p>But the great corrupter of them all was Swift. The <hi>re≈øervoir</hi> of filthine≈øs; all the ≈øeparate ≈øtreams might claim him for their parent ≈øource. I have already given my ≈øentiments of this author. It is not nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øwell the invective, or add any thing to the charges, adduced again≈øt him. His abilities I never ≈øu≈øpected; but I always called in que≈øtion his temper and his heart.</p>
                     <p>Panegyri≈øts, however, have enumerated his many virtues. To Ireland, they ≈øay, he was a ≈økilful patriot; to the church, a defender, and to the poor, a friend.</p>
                     <p>For the honour of human nature, I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put a negative on the≈øe virtues. Let
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023176_0217_0FBDDFA8E61DB890"/>them all be taken into the <hi>general</hi> account. The balance will not ≈øtill be heavy in his favour.</p>

                     <p>WHATEVER devotional writers increa≈øe your piety, by all means u≈øe them.

                     <p>From my ob≈øervations, however, upon life and manners, that piety has always appeared the mo≈øt <hi>durable,</hi> which is mo≈øt founded on rea≈øon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; and, though I abhor the cold rock of ≈øceptici≈øm, yet there is, likewi≈øe, ≈øome danger, that a well di≈øpo≈øed woman, who≈øe ≈øen≈øibility is, as yet ≈øtronger than her judgment, may founder on the oppo≈øite quick≈øands of enthu≈øia≈øm, or of ≈øuper≈øtition.</p>

                     <p>There are moments in the moral life, when fancy plucks the reins out of the hands of rea≈øon; and though ≈øhe drives at intervals with a furious rapidity, yet nature ≈øoon becomes exhau≈øted with the violence, and cannot mount ≈øome intervening hills without ≈øtopping for refre≈øhment.

                     <p>I AM ≈øorry to ≈øay, that you di≈øplay a <hi>fal≈øe</hi> ta≈øte in admiring Kilkhampton Abbey. I am now ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its merits, merely as a <hi>compo≈øition.</hi> It is not executed with the ≈økill of a ma≈øter. The ≈øame uniform turn of period and of ≈øentiment, and the ≈øame laboured <hi>pomp</hi> of words, is vi≈øible through all the different in≈øcriptions. Surely the epitaphs on ≈øo many characters, all written as might be
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:023176_0219_0FBDDFABE64299F8"/>≈øuppo≈øed, by <hi>different</hi> hands, ≈øhould be various and multiform.</p>
                     <p>I never thought epitaph an ea≈øy ≈øpecies of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It requires ≈øuch a nice di≈øcrimination of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ≈øuch a force of pathos, and ≈øo conci≈øe an elegance, as fall not to the lot of one man, in a thou≈øand. Many have <hi>attempted</hi> this ≈øtyle of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition; but, in my opinion, few have ≈øucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>I do, indeed, mo≈øt cordially dete≈øt this <hi>anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> abu≈øe. It is contrary to all my ideas of civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization, politene≈øs, fortitude, and even common gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ero≈øity, and militates again≈øt every thing, that ≈øhould con≈øtitute the real character of a gentleman, or a chri≈øtian.</p>
                     <p>No man lives, without <hi>foibles</hi> or <hi>particularities;</hi> and, if in≈øtead of making allowance for tho≈øe of others, in order to receive an indulgence for our own, we ungenerou≈øly expo≈øe them to ridicule or contempt, the con≈øequence, in ≈øociety, mu≈øt be a general coldne≈øs, di≈øgu≈øt, rancour, ho≈øtility, and <hi>uncea≈øing</hi> per≈øecution.</p>
                     <p>No per≈øon can be ≈øo circum≈øpect, particularly, in a public character, as to avoid creating, though without intending it, a number of little piques and enemies again≈øt him≈øelf; ≈øometimes even by an inflexible di≈øcharge of <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> duties; and if his character mu≈øt be taken from the colourings of tho≈øe, whom he has thus innocently, perhaps <hi>laudably,</hi> offended, all his virtues will be thrown into the back ground, and his foibles aggravated with the utmo≈øt virulence of malice and re≈øentment. Prejudice <hi>again≈øt,</hi> may render the mo≈øt amiable per≈øon <hi>ridiculous,</hi> by concealing the <hi>great,</hi> and bringing forward the little; and prejudice <hi>for,</hi> may give ≈øome ≈øort of merit to the mo≈øt de≈øpicable and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023176_0220_0FBDDFAD684BCBC0"/>abandoned. Such a liberty of the pre≈øs is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>licentiou≈øne≈øs;</hi> and every friend to order and virtue, if he will con≈øult his own feelings, will not he≈øitate to pronounce, that, of all <hi>≈øacred</hi> things, character is <hi>mo≈øt</hi> ≈øo.</p>
                     <p>If a per≈øon, however great, had u≈øed me <hi>ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly,</hi> I would certainly expo≈øe him to public cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, and drag him before the formidable tribunal of my country. I would appeal from the oppre≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of any <hi>individual,</hi> to the <hi>general</hi> equity and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of mankind. <hi>This,</hi> I ≈øhould conceive, not merely an act of ju≈øtice to <hi>my≈øelf,</hi> but likewi≈øe to the world. It is a <hi>common</hi> intere≈øt, that <hi>tyrants,</hi> however high in rank, or in ≈øelf-e≈øtimation, ≈øhould meet with their de≈øerved infamy and contempt.‚Äî Such a di≈øplay of <hi>true</hi> ≈øpirit wonderfully ≈øtops the progre≈øs of de≈øpoti≈øm, and teaches in≈øolence the hard le≈ø≈øon of moderation. But, then, it ≈øhould be done in the mo≈øt open manner. I would can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly ≈øub≈øcribe my name to the charges, I adduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, whil≈øt I ≈øhewed the world that I feared not the per≈øon of man, I would convince mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øary, that I was far above the meanne≈øs of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>unmanly</hi> or ungenerous revenge.</p>
                     <p>This hone≈øt courage was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, in an eminent degree, by the late Dr. John≈øon. Nothing has plea≈øed me more in the hi≈øtory of his life, than his troly magnanimous conduct to the late earl of Che≈øterfield. When he undertook to compo≈øe his <hi>elaborate</hi> dictionary, he ≈øolicited the favour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribing it to his Lord≈øhip, who was then if I mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not Secretary of State. Flattered with <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the patron of literature, Che≈øterfield accepted the honour of the dedication, and an <hi>honour</hi> it would have been to any nobleman in the world.‚Äî
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023176_0221_0FBDDFAEE6B4E3C8"/>In the progre≈øs of this long and tedious work, he received no very ≈øolid marks of encouragement from his patron, and ≈øu≈øpected on the whole, that the courtly peer meant only to <hi>amu≈øe</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>John≈øon had too much ≈øpirit either to brook the idea of neglect, the chicanery of a mini≈øter, the violation of a promi≈øe, or the ≈øervility of an abject dependence. He was not likely to be daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled with the glitter of a coronet, or intimidated with the ceremonious pageantry of office. He, therefore, wrote a formal letter to the nobleman, upbraiding him with in≈øincerity, di≈øclaiming his protection, and a≈ø≈øuring him, that he did not want, and never would receive, any of his favours.‚Äî The con≈øequence of this <hi>fracas</hi> was, that he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ≈øtung Che≈øterfield with ≈øuch bitter invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and ≈øo many pointed ≈øtrokes of raillery and ≈øatire, as made him heartily repent of having rou≈øed his re≈øentment, and de≈øirous, at any rate, of a reconciliation. John≈øon, however, per≈øi≈øted in his antipathy, and never afterwards, I believe wrote a dedication.</p>
                     <p>If Che≈øterfield intended only to dally with the author of this dictionary, he ≈øhould certainly have con≈øidered, that men of great abilities have too much penetration not to ≈øee through any flim≈øy di≈øgui≈øes of a mini≈øter; too much irritability not to be exa≈øperated with hypocri≈øy or artifice, and too <hi>lofty</hi> a reliance on their own <hi>native</hi> powers to be afraid of any peer or monarch in the world.</p>
                     <p>John≈øon, it is true, had not then attained all his eminence and di≈øtinction. He was comparatively, but <hi>ri≈øing</hi> into notice. The day that ≈øhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him the hero of literature, was only in its dawn. But contra≈øted with his <hi>≈øolid</hi> merit, what
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023176_0222_0FBDDFB06882DD68"/>is the paltry tin≈øel of ≈øtation, from which ≈øome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple immediately become ≈øo ≈øupercilious and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding?</p>
                     <p>If Che≈øterfield did not think the author of the Rambler, greater than him≈øelf; if from the foot alone, he could not progno≈øticate the future ≈øtrength and immen≈øe proportions of this literary <hi>Hercules,</hi> he had not a ≈øingle grain of that ≈øhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs or di≈øcernment for which he has been ≈øo much complimented by the world.</p>
                     <p>Such is <hi>my</hi> idea of the true and genuine ≈øpirit, which ≈øhould characterize a ≈øcholar and a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. It is not a ≈øtiletto, ≈øtabbing in the dark, but a challenge to a fair and generous on≈øet, in which your antagoni≈øt has the opportunity of ≈øelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and of managing all his weapons to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>

                     <p>THE beauty of the lady you allude to, was her misfortune. It in≈øpired her with an immoderate vanity, and that vanity paved the way to her ruin. It dug the grave, in which her peace and character are now intombed.</p>
                     <p>And after all, my dear girl, what <hi>is</hi> this beauty? It is a little clay, ca≈øt in an elegant mould, and by the hand of an exqui≈øite arti≈øt, fa≈øhioned into ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ≈øymmetry and order. It is a ≈ømall mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the cheek of ro≈øes and carnations.</p>
                     <p>But who needs to be informed that clay is very peri≈øhable, that ro≈øes and carnations are but for <hi>≈øummer moments,</hi> and that afterwards there comes a

                     <p>How tran≈øient are the power and duration of beauty! How very ≈ølight an accident or di≈øea≈øe bla≈øts it for ever! How fatal is a fever, the ≈ømall pox, or a little corroding grief to all its allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! and if they do not peri≈øh ≈øooner, how dreadfully are they ravaged by the hand of time!</p>
                     <p>Whil≈øt ≈øummer la≈øts, a few, fluttering in≈øects light upon its lips, to ≈øip the ≈øweets. Some ≈øtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling birds of pa≈ø≈øage chirp upon the neighbouring ≈øpray, delighted with a view of the amiable object.

                     <p>How ridiculous is the girl, who wilfully ≈øwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the poi≈øon of flattery for any per≈øonal charms, and, in the height of her intoxication, can be in≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or conceited! What woman of ≈øpirit ≈øhould not a≈øpire to qualities, that are le≈øs <hi>accidental</hi> and le≈øs ≈øubject to change! What woman of reflexion ≈øhould not re≈øolve to adorn and cultivate a mind, who≈øe trea≈øures may be inexhau≈øtible, and who≈øe attractions never die?</p>
                     <p>I pity every girl, whom nature has gifted with a very pretty face. She ≈øeems, by the very act, to have marked her out for trials and temptations, and our ≈øtrength is not always in proportion to our conflicts.</p>

                     <p>The death of ≈øuch a per≈øon is more than the lo≈øs of the neare≈øt relatives. A <hi>good</hi> clergyman, in the <hi>country,</hi> unites, in his own per≈øon, all the tender connections. He is father, brother, guardian, all in one. Dr. ‚Äî was not only revered as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter, but in every family welcomed as a bo≈øom friend.</p>
                     <p>A religious pa≈øtor, indeed, never fully knows the comforts of his office, till he is thus united to his people, <q>till he knows his ≈øheep and they follow him.</q> In ≈øuch an intimacy, hearts expand; many excellent and ≈øea≈øonable advices may be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en which the ≈øolemnity of the pulpit would not admit; little griefs are unbo≈øomed; little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities are removed, and affection ≈øprings up by the ≈øide of duty.</p>

                     <p>THE apprehen≈øions concerning Dr ‚Äî were but too well founded. He is, I do believe, in the la≈øt ≈øtages of his life. Death is on the point of elo≈øing his eyes, and opening for him the ju≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all his labours and his zeal.</p>
                     <p>I have been with him almo≈øt night and day, ever ≈øince I had the plea≈øure of writing to you, and have received a ≈øtronger le≈ø≈øon, than ever, of the vanity of all earthly things, and the ≈øupreme dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of virtue.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe ≈øolemn ≈øcenes wonderfully improve the heart. They ≈øtrip ambition of its plumage. The world appears a phantom! honours and promotions all a dream!</p>
                     <p>Though I have been much affected, yet I have been comforted in an equal degree, by his cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piety, and edifying conver≈øation. His faith and re≈øignation ri≈øe ≈øuperior to his pains. They are literally big with immortality; and he longs to be di≈ø≈øolved and to be with Chri≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Unwearied and exemplary as he has <hi>always</hi> been in the di≈øcharge of his pa≈øtoral duties he is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually lamenting his want of zeal, vigilance and exertion. The duties of the mini≈øtry are, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, beyond human ability: <q>who, ≈øaid St. Paul, is ≈øufficient for the≈øe things?</q> But when I hear the declarations of this excellent man, and compare, as it is natural, his example with my own, I cannot but be ≈øeriou≈øly alarmed, and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023176_0228_0FBDDFB964CE5530"/>≈øketch out nothing for <hi>my own</hi> la≈øt moments, but remor≈øe and fears.</p>
                     <p>My good friend and his lady have taken their la≈øt leave. It would have touched <hi>any</hi> heart to have ≈øeen this interview. I cannot do it ju≈øtice by <hi>words.</hi> The pencil of a Raphael could not fully repre≈øent it. It was all <hi>heart</hi> and ≈øoul. Silent looks and <hi>manner</hi> were the principal language, and they ≈øpoke indeed! Such a woman's brea≈øt pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with grief, upon ≈øuch an occa≈øion, ri≈øes above the powers of de≈øcription.</p>
                     <p>"O (≈øays the expiring chri≈øtian, rai≈øing his languid eyes and endeavouring to u≈øe a tongue, which death had almo≈øt pal≈øied,) <q>be as you <hi>have</hi> been, the comforters of my people (for they alas! will feel a <hi>tran≈øient</hi> void,) and our friend≈øhip, I doubt not, will ≈øhortly be renewed in another life. Death can only, for a little time, ≈øeparate the≈øe <hi>bodies:</hi> our real <hi>intere≈øts.</hi> our <hi>≈øouls</hi> and happine≈øs mu≈øt ever be united.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Loui≈øa is incon≈øolable. "Tears have been her meat day and night;" and her grief is the heavier, as ≈øhe is not permitted, from motives of <hi>prudence,</hi> to ≈øee the la≈øt ≈øtruggles of this excellent man, or receive his ble≈ø≈øing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Providence, (≈øays the accompli≈øhed girl,) has <hi>now,</hi> but, <hi>one</hi> heavier ≈øtroke to inflict, and that is the death of my father, or my mother. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>≈øecond</hi> father he has always been to me, in the fulle≈øt ≈øen≈øe of the word. What has not this good man done, what has he not ever ≈øaid to train my youthful ≈øentiments to virtue, and direct my ≈øteps into the way of peace? To <hi>him</hi> I could di≈øclo≈øe every ri≈øing fear. To him I could unbo≈øom the anxious ≈øorrow, that would
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:023176_0229_0FBDDFBAE66354E0"/>have lurked at my heart. But why ≈øhould I complain? Have I not ≈øtill a <hi>thou≈øand</hi> comforts, ≈øpread round my retirement? Have I not <hi>yet</hi> two parents left, accompli≈øhed, as they are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and watchful, as they are good? It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to grieve. I will dry the≈øe tears. It is the Lord, let him do what ≈øeemeth him good. The good Abraham was required to ≈øacrifice on the altar, with his <hi>own</hi> hands, an only ≈øon. And I ≈øhould ≈øurely learn to re≈øign without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, whenever it ≈øhall ≈øeem meet to his wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodne≈øs, the neare≈øt friend.</q>

                     <p>THE conflict is fini≈øhed. The pangs are over. Dr. ‚Äî is no more. He is now, I tru≈øt, a ble≈ø≈øed ≈øpirit, and knows no longer pain, or ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or apprehen≈øion.</p>
                     <p>From the natural tenderne≈øs and ≈øen≈øibility of his temper you may wonder that he lived and died unmarried. But it is a ≈øecret known only to his intimate friends that he had formed an attachment, in his early years, which being di≈øappointed by the death of the lady, the delicacy of his mind never <hi>afterwards</hi> admitted of another. His partiality was not of the common fugitive kind. It was a deep and <hi>permanent</hi> impre≈ø≈øion. Having once fondly loved, he attempted to love no more.</p>
                     <p>As his private fortune was comfortable, and his preferment, good, you will conclude, perhaps,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:023176_0230_0FBDDFBC65CD1BD8"/>that he died very rich. But this is not the ca≈øe. The poor were con≈øtantly fed from his table, as well as edified by his coun≈øels. He was a living example of the charity he recommended, and a witne≈øs of the truth, "that it is more ble≈ø≈øed to give than to receive."</p>
                     <p>Though remarkable for his prudence, as well as pa≈øtoral zeal, yet having but a few, di≈øtant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who were all in very ea≈øy circum≈øtances, he has only left to each, an equal legacy of ¬£100 and the remainder of the ¬£5000, he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, is entirely devoted to charitable u≈øes.</p>
                     <p>To each of his three ≈øervants, he has bequeathed an annual ≈øtipend of ¬£20, on this ea≈øy condition, however, that they be never ab≈øent, when in <hi>health,</hi> from the church or ≈øacrament; that they always appear neat and decent, and that they lay up, from their pittance, one ≈øingle ≈øix pence on the fir≈øt day of every week, to be expended in <hi>charity.</hi> The re≈øidue of his fortune is to be employed, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in e≈øtabli≈øing a fund for the di≈øtribution of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious books and tracts, among≈øt the poor and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his pari≈øh, at the di≈øcretion of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øter; and, partly, for the clothing and educating a ≈øpecific number of boys and girls in a ≈øchool, which he had founded, and very principally ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in his life-time.</p>
                     <p>My friend and I are joint executors.

                     <p>When the poor girl was informed of this legacy, ≈øhe bur≈øt into a flood of tears, nor could all the tender offices of her friends con≈øole her. <q>How in≈øupportable (≈øaid ≈øhe,) is this man's genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity! with what a cruel kindne≈øs does he haunt me after death!

                     <p>I REJOICE to hear that you have ≈øo great a ta≈øte for paintings. You will find it an inexhau≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ≈øource of plea≈øure and improvement. For,

                        </q>
I will give you a very hand≈øome eulogy on this art, in the words of a great writer, Quintilian. <q>Picture (≈øays he,) a ≈øilent and uniform addre≈øs, yet penetrates ≈øo deeply into our inmo≈øt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it ≈øeems often to exceed even the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of eloquence. Its effects, indeed, are ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times amazing. It is ≈øaid, that Alexander trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and grew pale, on ≈øeeing a picture of Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes, betrayed to death by his friends; it bringing to his mind a ≈øtinging remembrance of his treatment of Ari≈øtonicus. Portia could bear, with an un≈øhaken con≈øtancy, her la≈øt ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Brutus; but when ≈øhe ≈øaw, ≈øome hours after a picture of the parting of Hector and Andromache, ≈øhe bur≈øt into a flood of tears. Full as ≈øeemed her ≈øorrow, the painter ≈øugge≈øted new ideas of grief, or impre≈ø≈øed more ≈øtrongly her <hi>own.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your que≈øtion concerning the ≈øuperiority of the ancients or moderns in this particular, is very ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an≈øwered. In mo≈øt, if not <hi>all</hi> the fine arts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the former, according to my apprehen≈øion, are ab≈øolutely unrivalled. By the ancients, I <hi>now</hi> mean, particularly the Greeks.</p>
                     <p>Whether it was owing to the particular nature and freedom of their government‚Äîto the ≈øuperior honours 
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023176_0233_0FBDDFC0E73AEC48"/>and encouragement that were lavi≈øhed on genius and the arts in this more early period of ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety‚Äîwhether to any particular ≈øuperiority of organization in the natives of this country‚Äîwhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to its beautiful ≈øcenery or the allegorical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a religion, which ≈øo much called painting, poetry and ≈øculpture into exerci≈øe‚Äîor whether we may not a≈øcribe it to an happy <hi>combination</hi> of all the≈øe ≈øeparate cau≈øes, it is certain, that their ta≈øte and imaginaton were exqui≈øite beyond tho≈øe of any other people, and produced a degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in their arti≈øts, that we cannot find in any other age or country of the world.</p>
                     <p>Raphael, whom all Europe has ≈øo much prai≈øed, excelled only, as he formed him≈øelf upon the model of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Italians (ob≈øerves an able judge,) may excel in colouring; but compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, drawing, the art of grouping, attitude, movement, expre≈ø≈øion, contra≈øt, drapery, charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and grace‚Äîall the≈øe, this great genius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øedly borrowed from the ancient ≈øtatues and bas reliefs.</p>
                     <p>Palladio is the fir≈øt of architects, Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo, Fiammingo, Algardi, the mo≈øt celebrated ≈øculptors, only for the ≈øame rea≈øon; they ≈øtudied the Greeks. Yet Angelo was the bolde≈øt genius, that Italy ever had. "It was he, who conceived the idea of placing the pantheon in the air, and con≈øtructed the dome of St. Peter's on the ≈øame dimen≈øions."</p>
                     <p>Nor in <hi>letters</hi> were the Greeks le≈øs the model of perfection. To emulate their be≈øt writers has been the ambition of every ≈øucceeding age. And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence has been attained only in proportion to the ≈øucce≈øsfulne≈øs of this imitation.</p>

The fir≈øt and mo≈øt complete <hi>poem</hi> in the world, is Grecian‚Äîthe Iliad of Homer. It unites all the ≈øeparate a≈øtoni≈øhing excellencies of this mo≈øt difficult ≈øpecies of compo≈øition; the maje≈øtic, the terrible, the pathetic and the ≈øublime. Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øts, philo≈øophers, painters, poets, orators, metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øicians have all, in various methods, dug from this mine, and ≈øtill left it full of inexhau≈øtible trea≈øures. It is proverbially known how much the great Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man orator ≈øtudied Homer, and indeed how much he has been prai≈øed by the whole world. I will give you a few te≈øtimonies in his favour.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt critic, that ever exi≈øted, is Longinus, who wrote a treati≈øe on the ≈øublime: This is <hi>his</hi> opinion of the Iliad:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Tho≈øe only, who have ≈øublime and ≈øolid thoughts, can make elevated di≈øcour≈øes and, in this part, Homer chiefly excels, who≈øe thoughts are all ≈øublime, as may be ≈øeen in the de≈øcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the godde≈øs, Di≈øcord, who has, ≈øays he, her head in the ≈økies, and her feet upon the earth; for it may be ≈øaid, that that grandeur which he gives her, is le≈øs the mea≈øure of Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, than of the capacity and elevation of Homer's genius.</q>

                     <p>Again in another place: <q>To Homer, that is, to him, who had received the applau≈øes of the whole world.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, in a third pa≈ø≈øage, mentioning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, who had endeavoured to imitate Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he ob≈øerves:</p>

                        <q>Plato, however, is he, who has imitated him mo≈øt, for he has drawn from this poet, as

                     <p>THE Italians excel in ≈øome of the fine arts. In <hi>mu≈øic,</hi> perhaps, they may ju≈øtly claim a deci≈øive ≈øuperiority. Of <hi>colouring</hi> they are great ma≈øters. Among≈øt many other di≈øtingui≈øhed painters, they boa≈øt a Corregio. No one could do more honour
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023176_0237_0FBDDFC6E4B994B0"/>to any nation. He is the very pupil of nature, and has wonderfully united elegance and ea≈øe. If Raphael ≈øhines in the <hi>maje≈øtic,</hi> he has all the <hi>≈øoft</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> graces.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>land≈øcape</hi> painting, Italy is unrivalled. Tho≈øe of Claude Lorrain are ≈øuperior to any other ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's. Perhaps one rea≈øon is, the beauty of the ≈øcenes, from which they are taken. Viewed col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, there is not, I ≈øhould conceive, a more delightful and enchanting country. It ≈øeems to mingle all the ≈øoft and milder beauties of climate, with the magnificent and tremendous; gentle hills, rich vallies, fruitful exten≈øive vineyards, with craggy, rugged precipices, with the portentous a≈øpect and caverns of Aetna; the bay of Naples, with the formidable grandeur and thunder of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuvio.</p>
                     <p>No place has been the ≈øcene of ≈øo many memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable events, or given birth to ≈øuch a number of di≈øtingui≈øhed men. Tu≈øcany produced Dante, Petrarch, and Michael Angelo; Livy was born at Padua; Titian at Venice, and Ario≈øto at Ferrara. Urbino is ju≈øtly proud of Raphael, and Parma of Corregio. Rome claims Tacitus and Lucretius, Arpinum, Cicero, and Venu≈øium, Horace.</p>
                     <p>If my lei≈øure and opportunities had been equal to my wi≈øhes, I ≈øhould have gloried in traver≈øing this country. Every ≈øtep would have had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar intere≈øt, and every ≈øcene revived tho≈øe glowing de≈øcriptions of a Virgil or an Horace, that fa≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated my <hi>earlie≈øt</hi> years. When a per≈øon has been ≈øome time, in the world, whatever recalls the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> days of life, admini≈øters the ≈øweete≈øt plea≈øure. It is the picture of innocence and tranquility, whil≈øt our maturer age is often a bu≈øtle or a ≈øtorm.</p>

In ancient Rome, it was a confe≈ø≈øed maxim, that true politene≈øs and ta≈øte were derived from the Grecians. And the Italian arti≈øts ≈øcill owe much of their excellence to the≈øe primitive ma≈øters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>literary</hi> ta≈øte of the Italians is very excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable. It is a fal≈øe ≈øublime, a fictitious glitter, and a barren abundance, and has lo≈øt the true Attic ≈øalt of nature, of truth and ≈øimplicity. Hence they are ≈øaid to prefer the Gothic works of Dante, the ab≈øurdities of Ario≈øto, the extravagancies of Marini, and the tin≈øel puerilities of Ta≈ø≈øo, to the tender and impa≈ø≈øioned de≈øcriptions of Meta≈øta≈øio.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> ≈øeem to think them≈øelves exclu≈øive proprietors of every thing, that goes under the denomination of ta≈øte. And, indeed, they are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niver≈øally e≈øteemed a poli≈øhed, ea≈øy, graceful and ≈øeducing people. Few of their writers, however, have much of the <hi>profound,</hi> or that bids fair for <hi>duration.</hi> Of <hi>all</hi> people, they ≈øeem <hi>lea≈øt</hi> to have ≈øtudied the cla≈ø≈øics. Their ≈øtile, in general, wants energy and compactne≈øs. In <hi>many</hi> words they communicate but <hi>few</hi> ideas, and their imagination is permitted to run <hi>wild</hi> without hearkening to the ≈øober dictates of judgment. Though trees in blo≈ø≈øom are a beautiful object, yet the ≈øolid <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> lies in their <hi>fruit.</hi> I could except many great names from this, <hi>apparently,</hi> inviduous cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure. One, particularly, I will mention‚Äîthat is Monte≈øquieu. This man will do them honour with all other nations, and the mo≈øt di≈øtant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity. His <hi>E≈øprit de Loix</hi> is, indeed, a mo≈øt a≈øtoni≈øhing performance. It unites the depth, the phlegm and patience of ≈øome other countries, with the vivacity of that, in which it ≈øprung.</p>

I do not think that England is, by any means, either from climate, or other fo≈øtering circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, the <hi>natural</hi> ≈øoil of the <hi>fine arts.</hi> The hot bed of riches it is true, has rai≈øed a few <hi>exotics,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> way to a ≈øuperior <hi>flavour;</hi> and public encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement called forth many virtuo≈øos from other countries. But in fact, we are too much engaged with trade and politics to cultivate, in any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary degree, the <hi>finer</hi> emotions. Commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial habits, manufactures, and the love of money, wherever they prevail, will always be the grave of <hi>virt√π</hi> and of ta≈øte. In point of <hi>polite</hi> learning this kingdom has, long ≈øince, according to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion, been at its zenith. The ≈øun of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øtan age appears to be ≈øet. But for <hi>profound</hi> knowledge and genius, no nation, perhaps in the known world <hi>has</hi> been more di≈øtingui≈øhed.‚Äî Shake≈øpeare, Milton, Locke, Sir I≈øaac Newton! what other country can produce ≈øuch a group?‚Äî Nor ≈øhall we want models of the mo≈øt graceful in <hi>writing,</hi> whil≈øt we can read the works of Addi≈øon, many papers in the World, the Letters of Lady Wortley Montague, or tho≈øe of Che≈øterfield.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to deny, but that <hi>general ≈øcience</hi> is more cultivated among the moderns, than it ever was by the ancients, and, in the <hi>pre≈øent</hi> age, more than at any former period whatever. Nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural philo≈øophy in all its branches, chemi≈øtry, mathematics, hi≈øtory, politics, juri≈øprudence, and the mechanical arts have arrived to a wonderful degree of perfection, and are daily receiving fre≈øh acce≈ø≈øions of improvement. But I mu≈øt ≈øtill a≈ø≈øert, that polite learning ≈øeems to have flouri≈øhed mo≈øt in the days of Swift, Pope and Addi≈øon. What can be the rea≈øon? Is it that being <hi>then</hi> more new,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:023176_0240_0FBDDFCB67885898"/>as having but ju≈øt emerged from the darkne≈øs of the times, it was treated with that ≈øuperior re≈øpect and deference, we extend to a ≈øtranger? Is there a greater <hi>dearth</hi> of real genius? <hi>That</hi> we cannot ≈øuppo≈øe, if we give our≈øelves only lei≈øure to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the many exalted characters, which Britain boa≈øts. The ca≈øe, I think, is clear, that a mo≈øt extended commerce has deba≈øed our feelings and vitiated our ta≈øte; that the grand, <hi>political</hi> intere≈øts of the nation, as it is <hi>now</hi> circum≈øtanced, require a mo≈øt unremitting attention; that the high road to honours and emoluments chiefly lying through the bar or ≈øenate, the greate≈øt talents in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are turned into the≈øe channels.

                     <p>Many writers, in our <hi>Augu≈øtan</hi> age, arrived by their labours merely, not only to con≈øiderable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, but to high di≈øtinctions.

                     <p>YOUR knowledge of the Italian language is much ≈øuperior to my own. The little that I <hi>have,</hi> was acquired merely to read a few productions of their be≈øt authors, and be able to form ≈øome <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative</hi> idea of their merits or defects.</p>
                     <p>I am far from denying to this people the prai≈øe of great genius. But I ≈øhould ≈øuppo≈øe, that it is not properly cultivated, and the rea≈øon, perhaps, may be, that, in <hi>modern</hi> Italy, learning meets but with little encouragement.</p>
                     <p>The bad ta≈øte of the Italians in <hi>poetry,</hi> is obvious from many in≈øtances. Dante, in <hi>their</hi> e≈øtimation, is ≈øuperior to <hi>all</hi> men; and Ario≈øto, whom they con≈øider as much beneath him, they exalt far above Homer him≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>Dante had, doubtle≈øs, wonderful abilities. He ri≈øes in many in≈øtances, to the ≈øublime; and, for the times, in which he lived, may ju≈øtly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered as a literary <hi>prodigy.</hi> But his work, on the whole, is but a <hi>gothic</hi> ma≈øs of various kinds of knowledge ≈øtrangely heaped together without ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, de≈øign, or per≈øpicuity.

                     <p>Many of them will approach you with <hi>flattery.</hi> This, they have been led to think, the only, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent coin, with the generality of females.

                     <p>MEN in profe≈ø≈øions may be expected to po≈ø≈øe≈øs the mo≈øt <hi>liberal</hi> ≈øentiments, as having enjoyed a ≈øuperior education; and their manners and ≈øocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will, of cour≈øe, be mo≈øt agreeable and intere≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ladies. Military people are, <hi>proverbially,</hi> favourites.</p>
                     <p>I will not ≈øo much degrade the dignity of your ≈øex, as to ≈øuppo≈øe, that it is the mere colour of their habits, which <hi>dazzles</hi> your eyes, and works ≈øuch a≈øtoni≈øhing <hi>miracles</hi> in their favour. There are rea≈øons, which may account, more <hi>rationally,</hi> for your partiality, whil≈øt they do more credit to your under≈øtanding.</p>
                     <p>Undi≈øtracted with cares and bu≈øine≈øs, they are happy in that ea≈øy <hi>di≈øengagedne≈øs</hi> of mind, which can exhau≈øt all its efforts upon the ≈øingle article of <hi>plea≈øing.</hi> With much time upon their hands, they have frequent opportunities of being in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and of feeling, or at lea≈øt <hi>affecting</hi> admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Lively and volatile from an healthy life of activity and exerci≈øe, they ea≈øily a≈ø≈øimilate with the manners of a ≈øex, who≈øe di≈øtingui≈øhing grace is a cheerful vivacity. Having travelled through va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places and kingdoms, they nece≈ø≈øarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that ea≈øe and urbanity of manners, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult from a <hi>general</hi> intercour≈øe with mankind.‚Äî Expected, <hi>profe≈ø≈øionally,</hi> to be men of courage, you may <hi>≈øuppo≈øe</hi> them the be≈øt protectors of your per≈øon and your weakne≈øs. Their very choice of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marks them for <hi>genteel</hi> notions and ≈øpirit;
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:023176_0266_0FBDDDE3E7476B80"/>and any of the≈øe rea≈øons is, perhaps, no di≈øadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage with a female heart. I ≈øhould be ≈øorry to ≈øuppo≈øe, that their general love of plea≈øure, gaiety and <hi>intrigue</hi> is among≈øt their recommendations to the favour of tho≈øe, who <hi>≈øhould,</hi> uniformly, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage by their <hi>blu≈øhes</hi> and their <hi>frowns,</hi> every ≈øpecies of levity and vice.</p>
                     <p>In fact, and to be impartial, the agreeablene≈øs of officers, is like that of <hi>other</hi> men. There is the <hi>human</hi> mixture of the good and the bad. I have always found, from my own ob≈øervation, that the older and experienced are ≈øome of the mo≈øt intere≈øting characters in ≈øociety. The vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ≈øcenes, through which they have pa≈ø≈øed, give a ≈øprightline≈øs and <hi>diver≈øity</hi> to their conver≈øation, and their politene≈øs lends it a charm. I have met with no many of the <hi>younger</hi> ≈øort, who have ≈øeemed to think the <hi>petty</hi> ornament of a cockade an adequate ≈øub≈øtitute for all improvements of the mind; a ≈øhelter for litigious in≈øolence and <hi>puppyi≈øm,</hi> and an exclu≈øive ≈øecurity for the tendere≈øt affections, and attachment of woman.</p>
                     <p>But this evil is not con≈øined, merely, to the <hi>army.</hi> It is ≈øo in the church. How truly amiable are the experienced, the learned, and the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary of this profe≈ø≈øion, who≈øe knowledge is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ti≈ø≈øued with devotion, and ≈øoftened by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral intercour≈øe with the world! How many, on the other hand, when they are ju≈øt initiated into the ≈øacred office, ridiculou≈øly pique them≈øelves on a <hi>ca≈ø≈øock</hi> and a <hi>≈øcarf;</hi> and, under that ≈øolemn garb, go as far as po≈ø≈øible, in the mazes of beaui≈øm, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and affectation!</p>
                     <p>There are, doubtle≈øs, very amiable people in the army; but their <hi>general</hi> notions and treatment
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:023176_0267_0FBDDDE566CC1D18"/>of your ≈øex, forbid me to wi≈øh that you ≈øhould, ever, cultivate much acquaintance with them, becau≈øe the circum≈øtances, in which they are placed, render the thoughts of a <hi>≈øerious</hi> connection, by no means de≈øirable. If we could ≈øuppo≈øe their <hi>principles</hi> not to be injured by their <hi>mode</hi> of life; if they could re≈øign, from the moment of marriage, all their notions of unlimited gallantry, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, what is their pay, but a ≈øcanty ≈øub≈øi≈øtence for a ≈øolitary individual? What is their life, but an un≈øettled pilgrimage from one country to anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? How often are they called, at a <hi>moment's</hi> warning, to ≈øight, perhaps, to <hi>peri≈øh,</hi> for their king and country? or, to die more ≈øuddenly, and more ignominiou≈øly, by the hands of a Dueli≈øt, who challenges them into <hi>eternity</hi> for the ≈ølighte≈øt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, perhaps for the mi≈øplacing only of a ≈øylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!</p>
                     <p>In the mid≈øt of ≈øuch alarming pro≈øpects, what has a woman to expect from marriage with them, but continual toils, uncea≈øing dangers, perpetual apprehen≈øions; poverty, remor≈øe, vexation, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, without provi≈øion, and ≈øorrows, which the <hi>lenient</hi> hand of time, ≈øcarcely can a≈ø≈øuage.</p>
                     <p>If you was ever ≈øo happily united to a man of this de≈øcription, how dreadful mu≈øt be the ab≈øenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, you will have to bear, mixed as they will be, with a di≈ø≈øolving tenderne≈øs, and unavoidable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms; or, on the other hand, how in≈øupportable your toils, <q>with perils in the wilderne≈øs, perils by the ≈øea, and perils among≈øt fal≈øe brethren; with wearine≈øs, and painfulne≈øs, with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, often; with hunger and thir≈øt; with fa≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, often; with cold and nakedne≈øs.</q> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the fate of lady C‚Äîw‚Äîs, and drop a tear.

                     <p>A great writer has called a phy≈øician, "the mere play-thing of fortune."

If he ≈øucceeds, it will, frequently be <hi>late in life:</hi> and, if he does <hi>not,</hi> he mu≈øt be embarra≈ø≈øed indeed! The children of <hi>≈øuch</hi> a per≈øon <q>cannot dig, and to beg they are a≈øhamed.</q> Poverty, ≈øharpened by <hi>refinement</hi> and <hi>≈øen≈øibility,</hi> is afflicting in the extreme!</p>
                     <p>I do not think the profe≈ø≈øion of the <hi>law,</hi> calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to render a man, the mo≈øt agreeable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in the ≈øtill, unruffled ≈øhades of dome≈øtic life. It calls into continual exerci≈øe, the more <hi>turbid</hi> pa≈ø≈øions; it begets an unplea≈øant ≈øpirit of caviling
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:023176_0269_0FBDDDE868B29440"/>and contradiction, and has le≈øs tendency to nur≈øe the <hi>finer</hi> feelings, than any of the other learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øions.</p>
                     <p>By being crowded together, at a <hi>dangerous</hi> age, in the Temple or Lincoln's Inn, young men are apt to contract a licentiou≈øne≈øs of <hi>morals,</hi> a <hi>laxity</hi> of principles, a ≈øpecies of <hi>≈øceptici≈øm</hi> to palliate their vices, habits of <hi>profanene≈øs,</hi> not a little di≈ø≈øipation, and ≈øo far as <hi>your</hi> ≈øex is concerned, very dangerous notions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Before</hi> marriage, military men and young law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers are not, in my idea, the ≈øafe≈øt acquaintance. The fir≈øt are only bent, without looking any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on <hi>dome≈øticating</hi> them≈øelves, in agreeable families, by every polite attention to <hi>wives and daughters,</hi> and thus amu≈øing many, lei≈øure hours, which, in their ≈øtate of continual peregrination, would be, otherwi≈øe, in≈øupportable; the latter, in general, ≈øcruple not to go great lengths in gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where they have no <hi>≈øerious</hi> intention.</p>
                     <p>Beware of <hi>≈øuch</hi> ≈øociety; beware of your <hi>heart.</hi> Let not the <hi>unblu≈øhing</hi> front of a barri≈øter, let not the mere <hi>≈øcarlet habit</hi> of a <hi>petit maitre,</hi> who has ≈øtudied the windings of the female heart, infinitely more, than tacties, or the art of war, let not a few civil ≈øayings or flattering attentions beguile your imagination, or lay your prudence a≈øleep. I do not think the commerce very ≈øafe. If I had a girl of my own, I would not expo≈øe her to ≈øo <hi>dangerous</hi> a trial. Many, doubtle≈øs, have come off conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, but <hi>more</hi> have fallen; and their wounds and tears have made, upon <hi>my</hi> memory, a <hi>la≈øting</hi> impre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion.</p>
                     <p>Our imagination, however, annexes riches, honours, and even titles to the profe≈ø≈øion of the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:023176_0270_0FBDDDE9E7FCC930"/>law. But this fancy often <hi>mi≈øleads</hi> us. It is true, that merit has a greater chance in <hi>this,</hi> than in any other profe≈ø≈øion; and it is certain, that a fortunate <hi>few</hi> have attained to very con≈øiderable greatne≈øs. We hear of a Mansfield, a Thurlow, a Kenyon, a Lough borough, a Law, an Er≈økine, and are dazzled with their names, their ≈øucce≈øs, and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. But not a word is ≈øaid of a thou≈øand others of the fraternity, whom, though po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable talents, fortune never cho≈øe to bring into the public view, or to di≈øtingui≈øh with any of her favours.</p>
                     <p>But all the≈øe di≈øcouragements apart, if a lawyer is <hi>eminent,</hi> he can ≈øcarcely ever be at <hi>home. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual</hi> cares and bu≈øine≈øs ≈øurround him, and poi≈øon his repo≈øe. His wife and children mu≈øt be <hi>neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and dome≈øtic endearments ≈øacrificed to <hi>tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> cares. And if he be poor, no poverty can open the door to more chicanery, artifice, or meanne≈øs. At <hi>any</hi> rate, if he be a man of pure morals and religious principles, he has with≈øtood the greate≈øt temptations, that human nature can encounter, and for ≈øuperior and heroic virtue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt de≈øerves a place in the kalendar of ≈øaints.</p>
                     <p>See now a man's partiality to his <hi>own</hi> profe≈ø≈øion; but if it be not founded in rea≈øon, I beg you will reject it.</p>
                     <p>The office of <hi>clergymen</hi> calls them to a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and retired life, than that of mo≈øt other men. Their exemption from the bu≈øtle and competitions of the world nur≈øes innocence and ≈øen≈øibility; and if their heart be not <hi>very depraved,</hi> their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ≈øtudies mu≈øt <hi>≈øoften</hi> and re≈øine it. Their education <hi>≈øhould</hi> have given them the power of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:023176_0271_0FBDDDEB67074D70"/>and their calling <hi>≈øuppo≈øes</hi> not only <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,</hi> but piety and virtue.</p>
                     <p>A man of <hi>this</hi> ca≈øt ≈øeems particularly calculated not only to <hi>reli≈øh,</hi> but to <hi>enhance</hi> the happine≈øs of a married ≈øtate. With hours at command, he has lei≈øure for the tender offices of friend≈øhip, and the little, <hi>≈øportive</hi> play fulne≈øs of amu≈øing conver≈øation. Whil≈øt the woodbine and the ja≈ømine ≈øurround his mode≈øt man≈øion, he dreads no <hi>unpropitous</hi> accident, that ≈øhall drag him from his retreat, and can tread, with the faithful partner of his cares, the lonely "≈øilent haunts, which contemplation loves." He has time for ≈øuperintending the in≈øtruction of his children, and calling their latent powers into exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe and action. He has opportunity to <hi>realize</hi> the pictures of a Milton, and watch the opening beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>paradi≈øe</hi> about him.</p>
                     <p>Let me, however, be candid, and give you the <hi>po≈ø≈øible</hi> rever≈øe of this piece. The church is in a very unhappy ≈øituation. That education, which renders the eccle≈øia≈øtic agreeable, often ≈øharpens his affliction. That refinement, which captivates the elegant and inexperienced, is the ≈øpear, which fetches drops of blood from his heart. Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without an <hi>adequate</hi> provi≈øion, and incapable, by any <hi>≈øecular</hi> employment, of <hi>improving</hi> his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, the≈øe <hi>apparent</hi> privileges are only his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. The ≈øen≈øibility, which <hi>loves</hi> a woman, doubly mourns her allotment. That tenderne≈øs, which embraces children with ≈øuch affection, <hi>≈øhudders</hi> at their pro≈øpects. That independence, which re≈øults from <hi>liberal</hi> ≈øentiments, ≈øtartles at the thought of poverty or di≈øtre≈øs; and that peace, which he has found in the abodes of <hi>≈øolitude,</hi> unties him for the <hi>turbulent</hi> agitations of the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="unknown:023176_0272_0FBDDDECE6B39F90"/>
Many men, however, there are in this profe≈ø≈øion, very amply provided for; and, if one of the≈øe falls to your lot, with the habits and di≈øpo≈øitions, that <hi>≈øhould</hi> re≈øult from his character, I think you may form every <hi>rational</hi> hope of comfort and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Still, do not ≈øuppo≈øe me narrow or illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. There are, doubtle≈øs, numbers of worthy and amiable men in the <hi>other</hi> profe≈ø≈øions; there are, as certainly, many <hi>worthle≈øs, immoral,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate per≈øons in the <hi>church.

And as your heart is di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged, I meant only to ≈øtate the influence of different habits and employments on the mind, and the probability of their conducing to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs or mi≈øery in this <hi>important</hi> connection. And I <hi>≈øtill</hi> mu≈øt urge, that if a clergyman <hi>be</hi> a bad hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, it is in defiance of the ≈øtronge≈øt <hi>inducements</hi> to be <hi>otherwi≈øe,</hi> and of every di≈øpo≈øition, which his ≈øtudies and his prayers ≈øhould have led him, either to cultivate in <hi>him≈øelf,</hi> or recommend to <hi>others.</hi>

In proportion as the≈øe little matters had engaged his mind, ≈ømall attention had, you may ≈øuppo≈øe, been paid to the formation of his heart or under≈øtanding.</p>
                     <p>In this thoughtle≈øs period, it was the misfortune of this poor girl, with an elegant per≈øon and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øting manner, to fall in his way. She was beautiful; nature had de≈øigned her to plea≈øe; and, if ≈øhe had been connected with a ≈øen≈øible man, might have been moulded almo≈øt into any thing, that captivates in gracefulne≈øs, or a≈øtoni≈øhes in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding. Her per≈øonal accompli≈øhments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpired this <hi>petit maitre</hi> with a <hi>fugitive</hi> pa≈ø≈øion; his fortune was competent; di≈ø≈øimilarity of ta≈øtes, habits or abilities never was con≈øidered; tender tales were ≈øwallowed by her artle≈øs innocence, and his addre≈ø≈øes were accepted. After a very ≈øhort acquaintance, they are weary of each other. The force of beauty and of pa≈ø≈øion is exhau≈øted. He has not ta≈øte enough for the delicacies of friend≈øhip, nor knowledge to entertain a lonely hour with edifying conver≈øation, but flies to the bottle and his mad companions, for plea≈øures, which it is not in <hi>her</hi> power to be≈øtow; whil≈øt ≈øhe, poor creature! has lei≈øure to brood over her imprudence and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes in ≈øtill, dome≈øtic ≈øcenes, having learned, but alas! too late, that rational and <hi>durable</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment is only to be found with a per≈øon of virtue, principle and under≈øtanding.</p>
                     <p>For my own part, I had never any idea of ≈øuch <hi>early</hi> marriages. If this girl had ≈øeen the <hi>world,</hi> and a variety of characters, ≈øhe would not have ≈øubmitted to ≈øuch a connection; and if he had

                     <p>Be≈øides, what knowledge can a girl, at <hi>her</hi> age, have of the government of a family, or the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of <hi>dome≈øtic</hi> concerns?

                     <p>This, my dear LUCY, is the happie≈øt of lives.‚ÄîAfter all our ambition, and all our ≈øtruggles, it is chiefly in the <hi>≈øhade,</hi> that we mu≈øt find contentment. The plea≈øures <hi>there</hi> are calm; they are plea≈øures of the <hi>heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their hou≈øe is ≈øituated, at two miles di≈øtance from a con≈øiderable town in the county of ‚Äî, upon an eminence, which commands a full view of the city, but has its a≈øpect to tho≈øe woods and ≈øhades, with which its owners are infinitely more conver≈øant, than the more noi≈øy ≈øcenes of di≈ø≈øipated life. Elegant, but not ≈øuperb, and ≈øpacious, tho' plain, it expre≈ø≈øes the cultivated ta≈øte of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and the ho≈øpitable kindne≈øs that reigns within.</p>
                     <p>The plea≈øure grounds and gardens are in that unornamented ≈øtyle, which to me, is always par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly plea≈øing. Nature has not been wholly ≈øacrificed to art, nor wildne≈øs to refinement.‚ÄîThe wilderne≈øs here and there pre≈øents you with all its ≈øhaggy luxuriance, and venerable glooms.‚ÄîYou rove imbo≈øomed in woods and thickets, and are mingled at a di≈øtance from every prying eye, in tho≈øe ≈øilent haunts of ≈øolitude, which poetry has always decked with its charms. Here the hand of the Creator has formed a grotto, and art has not de≈øtroyed it; there an alcove, and the pruning knife has not <hi>officiou≈øly</hi> ≈øeparated the intwining branches. In one place, a little fountain murmurs, at its ea≈øe, and nothing has attempted to divert it from its original channel. In another you have tufted beauties, a ca≈øcade, a lawn, an hill or a valley, beautifully inter≈øper≈øed, exactly as they
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:023176_0282_0FBDDDFBE9582310"/>were formed by the hand of nature, in one of tho≈øe more ≈øportive moments, when ≈øhe wi≈øhed to plea≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Through the branches of a beautiful hanging wood, which lies before the hou≈øe, you de≈øcry the glittering ≈øpire of the pari≈øh church, belonging to the village, of which Eugenio is the patron, and a very exemplary clergyman, the pre≈øent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent. It is placed on a <hi>ri≈øing</hi> ground, as if continually a≈øpiring to that heaven, to which its excellent pa≈øtor is always calling the affections of his people. It is built in that gothic ≈øtyle, which I always mo≈øt approved in this ≈øacred kind of ≈øtructure, as be≈øt adapted to in≈øpire the mind with ≈øeriou≈øne≈øs and devotion. But it is not from the mere beauty of the place, or the deliciou≈øne≈øs of its ≈øituation, that its enviable owners derive their happine≈øs. They expect not from ≈øhrubs or blo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoms, or the mo≈øt enchanting ≈øcenery, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures of the heart.

Their hou≈øe is, in fact, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where prayers and prai≈øes, are regularly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, every night and morning, to the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and pre≈øerver of their lives. Every ≈øervant is required to attend the ≈øervice; and they are all <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øionally,</hi> in≈øtructed in their duties to God and man. They have likewi≈øe, each a little library of devotional tracts, which have been pre≈øented to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:023176_0283_0FBDDDFD67A15708"/>them by their generous ≈øuperiors. I had the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o≈øity one day, to examine the title pages, and found them, principally to con≈øi≈øt of the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of a Religious Life; Beveridge's Private Thought, and Re≈øolutions; Taylor's Holy Living and Dying; Advice again≈øt ≈øwearing, drunkenne≈øs, profanne≈øs, &amp;c. in little tracts from the Society, for promoting Chri≈øtian Knowledge; Wil≈øon on the Sacrament; the Chri≈øtian Pattern; Henry's Plea≈øantne≈øs of a Religious Life, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It would delight you to ob≈øerve with what a mixture of love and reverence, the≈øe ≈øervants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their <hi>real</hi> benefactors. You hear nothing, under <hi>this</hi> roof of tho≈øe feuds and animo≈øines, which ≈øo much embitter the happine≈øs of families. "They live as brethren together in unity." The only contention is, which ≈øhall be mo≈øt ardent, a≈ø≈øiduous and vigilant in the performance of their duty.</p>
                     <p>If Maria (Eugenio's lady,) has the <hi>≈ølighte≈øt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øpo≈øition, you might read it, without a≈øking a ≈øyllable, in the anxious looks and ge≈øtures of all her attendants.

                     </p>
                     <p>The piety of the≈øe people is the more engaging, becau≈øe it is always <hi>cheerful</hi> and ≈øerene. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from <hi>rea≈øen,</hi> and it encourages no <hi>unnatural</hi> authority or gloom.

<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023176_0284_0FBDDDFEE84C48C0"/>with ≈øuch a family? Who would not wi≈øh that friend≈øhip to be eternal?</p>

                     <p>MANY people of fortune are uncomfortable in marriage, for want of <hi>employment,</hi> or of ≈øomething to give an <hi>intere≈øt</hi> to the, otherwi≈øe, <hi>in≈øipid</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the ≈øame excur≈øions, vi≈øits, company, or entertainments. This is never the ca≈øe within the walls of Eugenio. He is always introducing, from incidents as they ri≈øe, ≈øome u≈øeful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining topics of conver≈øation. A news-paper, books, the garden, flowers, plants, ≈øhrubs, hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the azure vault of heaven, ≈øtars, planets, or even a common <hi>in≈øect,</hi> furni≈øh to this worthy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ample ≈øubjects for ob≈øervation, ever edifying, and ever new. His lady has ta≈øte and information enough to enter into the ≈øpirit of all the≈øe de≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the <hi>general</hi> ≈øcene is, not a little enliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the mode, in which they treat and educate their children.</p>
                     <p>My good friend is per≈øuaded, that public educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is <hi>generally</hi> managed, is more calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to teach languages and ≈øcience, than to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>principles</hi> or <hi>morals;</hi> and, therefore, keeps his ≈øons at home till they have acquired a ≈øufficient
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:023176_0285_0FBDDE0067C751B0"/>≈øtock of virtue to ≈øerve them as an antidote again≈øt the dangers of the world. They have, however, their regular ≈øchool hours and exerci≈øes, which are ob≈øerved with the mo≈øt undeviating punctuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The older of the boys has made a con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proficiency in the Latin Language. He has abridged the Engli≈øh and the Roman hi≈øtories, and is completely ver≈øed in heathen mythology. But, above all, he is in≈øtructed in the fundamentals of religion, and of his duty to God and man. The ≈øcriptures make a part of his daily reading; and the ≈øen≈øible parent embelli≈øhes them with ≈øuch a number of ≈øtriking ob≈øervations, as greatly intere≈øt the <hi>curio≈øity,</hi> and fix the attention of his unvitiated pupil.</p>
                     <p>With Rollin's Belles Lettres, and the Abbe Millot's <hi>Elementes ≈øur l'hi≈øtoire,</hi> he is perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. The latter he is abridging; and Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus is warmly pre≈ø≈øed on his attention, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining tho≈øe immortal le≈ø≈øons of virtue, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can dignify any character or ≈øtation.</p>
                     <p>Eugenio has been at the pains of throwing ≈øelect parts of Seneca, Marcus Antoninus, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morabillia of Xenophon into an Engli≈øh dre≈øs, for the advantage of his little family. He has ≈øelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ≈øy≈øtem of Ethics, and almo≈øt of divinity, from the entertaining works of Addi≈øon, John≈øon, The World,  and the arrangement is ≈øo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The fir≈øt morning, that I ≈øpent under this happy roof, I was awakened from my ≈ølumbers by the ≈øoft harmonious voice of Mi≈øs‚Äî, who was chanting to the harp≈øicord, an early hymn of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:023176_0286_0FBDDE01E702C548"/>and devotion to her merciful Creator. It was taken from the Spectator.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>When all thy mercies, O my God,</l>

                     <p>The whole reminded me of the words of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious poet:</p>

                     <p>This is her con≈øtant practice every morning, at ≈øix o'clock; and it has the happie≈øt effect on her temper and ≈øpirits, for the re≈øt of the day. It ≈øooths the ≈øoul to harmony, and cheri≈øhes all the gentler emotions.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after this was fini≈øhed, the lovely girl took a walk into the garden, as ≈øhe regularly does, when the weather will permit, to ob≈øerve the gradual progre≈øs, health and vegetation of her plants and flowers. I reque≈øted the honor of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending her, and was amazed, young as ≈øhe is, with her knowledge of natural hi≈øtory, and with the judicious remarks ≈øhe made on the power and goodne≈øs, on the wi≈ødom and contrivance of the magnificent Creator.</p>
                     <p>Before breakfa≈øt, Maria (their mother,) hears all the children together read the p≈øalms and le≈ø≈øons for the day. To this pious exerci≈øe I was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited; but I doubt not it was a ≈øpecimen of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male eloquence, de≈øcanting on the vanity of every
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:023176_0287_0FBDDE036931E9E8"/>thing, but devotion, and glancing at the dangers and temptations of the world.</p>
                     <p>The employment of this good family is as ≈øtrict, as u≈øual, and not le≈øs plea≈øing even upon Sundays.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fir≈øt</hi> exerci≈øe of this day, after the accu≈øtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hymn of prai≈øe to their Creator, is to abridge a few pages of Wil≈øon's Indian In≈øtructed, or of Secker's Lectures on the Catechi≈øm. After the ≈øervice, all the children give in, to the be≈øt of their power, an account of the ≈øermon, which they have heard. The compari≈øon of their different merits is plea≈øing, and the very <hi>conte≈øt</hi> excites emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>this</hi> is fini≈øhed their father in≈øtructs them with a ≈øhort <hi>comment</hi> on the le≈ø≈øons for the day. One happened to be the hi≈øtory of <hi>Dives and Lazarus.</hi> Very few have greater powers of the pathetic than my friend. He brought them all to tears with dwelling on the pitiable circum≈øtances of the <hi>beggar,</hi> and poured this le≈ø≈øon into their <hi>≈øoftened</hi> minds, that riches are <hi>apt</hi> to harden the heart, and have no real dignity or u≈øe, but as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in acts of <hi>mercy</hi> to our <hi>neighbour.</hi> He gave, to the parable at large, a new and <hi>≈øingular</hi> a≈øpect. He ob≈øerved, that luxury had led Dives to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and that unbelief had plunged him into hell.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>another</hi> occa≈øion, he dwelt on the ≈øcriptural hi≈øtory of Haman. In him, he expatiated on the uncertainty and ≈øicklene≈øs of all outward greatne≈øs, and the in≈øufficiency of honours, ≈øtations, popular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to confer any <hi>real</hi> happine≈øs on a mind, that had not ≈øubmitted to <hi>internal</hi> government and the di≈øcipline of religion.</p>

"What a trifle (≈øaid he,) deranged this great man's enjoyment! Becau≈øe a poor Mordecai would not bow to his pomp, his honours lo≈øt their flavour, and his dignities their charm; his ≈øleep went from him, and he refu≈øed to be comforted. If his pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions had been ≈øubdued, and his ≈øould regenerated with divine grace, he would have been contented in the lowe≈øt ob≈øcurity. A cottage would have given him more ≈øatisfaction than this palace. It would have been irradiated with hope, and it would have ≈ømiled with divine con≈øolations."</p>
                     <p>Eugenio is con≈øtant at <hi>church,</hi> and his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is an excellent pattern to all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandents. His features are marked with a ≈øerious fervour, and a cheerful dignity, when he is humbly pre≈øenting his ≈øupplications to the author of his being.</p>
                     <p>You would be charmed to ≈øee how the hone≈øt pea≈øants dwell on his looks! what eulogies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed in every countenance! what fervent ble≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are poured forth, when he ≈øtops to enquire about their families and concerns, and what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt wi≈øhes, that his man≈øion may long retain him, for its owner, and that his continuance among≈øt them, may be la≈øting as their days!</p>
                     <p>Not behind him in any of the <hi>milder</hi> virtues, his con≈øort <hi>looks up</hi> to him, with a con≈øcious infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, as the pride of her heart. Blended with more <hi>Jofine≈øs,</hi> her piety is, if po≈ø≈øible, ≈øtill more engaging; but ≈øhe ≈øeems to decline all <hi>per≈øonal</hi> con≈øequence, and to be wholly ab≈øorbed in the ≈øuperior lu≈øtre of his character and virtues. She receives the prayers and ble≈ø≈øings of their tenants, as if only due to the man of her affections; and, though the zeal of the populace would convey her, in their <hi>arms,</hi> yet, when Eugenio offers his hand
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:023176_0289_0FBDDE06682C7C20"/>to lift her into the carriage, her eyes ≈øparkle with peculiar cheerfulne≈øs, and ≈øtrongly expre≈øs both her love and gratitude to her protector and her friend.</p>
                     <p>It is no wonder that they are ≈øo much admired. No wonder that every tongue loads them with ble≈ø≈øings. This is but the <hi>≈øpeculative</hi> part of their piety; the <hi>practical</hi> is more u≈øeful and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging. They love their God; they love their Redeemer, and for his ≈øake they go about doing good. Not a tenant experiences an uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble year, but he receives a con≈øiderable abatement in his rent. Not a per≈øon is injured in all the neighbourhood, but his cau≈øe is pleaded, and his wrongs are redre≈ø≈øed. Not an old man exi≈øts, but he has ≈øomething, by way of <hi>pen≈øion,</hi> from this virtuous family, to ea≈øe his infirmities, and pillow his declining age. Not a great man endeavours to take advantage of a le≈ø≈øer, but my friend, who is an excellent lawyer, undertakes the bu≈øine≈øs, and expo≈øes the oppre≈ø≈øor to his merited contempt.</p>
                     <p>Every hour, that Maria can ≈øpare from her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular dome≈øtic employments, is ≈øpent in making garments, providing cordials, phy≈øic and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations for the naked, the ≈øick and indigent of her village; and there are times of the day, in which you would conclude, from the va≈øt concour≈øe of people, that their hou≈øe was a profe≈ø≈øed <hi>a≈øylum</hi> for poverty and di≈øtre≈øs.</p>

It is ≈øufficient for us to know, that the≈øe delights will be of a <hi>≈øpiritual</hi> nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ≈øupreme, all-perfect <hi>≈øpirit,</hi> and adapted to the fulle≈øt capacities of tho≈øe, he has been plea≈øed to <hi>glorify;</hi> that they will be exqui≈øite, as unbounded power and wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs can be≈øtow, and la≈øting, as the days of that <hi>eternal</hi> heaven, in which, they ≈øpring.</p>
                     <p>That we ≈øhall be able to recognize <hi>≈øpirits,</hi> and among≈øt others, tho≈øe of our neare≈øt <hi>intimates</hi> after death, is <hi>probable</hi> from the very nature of the ≈øoul, which cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed to lo≈øe its <hi>con≈øciou≈øne≈øs</hi> or <hi>recollection,</hi> whil≈øt the body is ≈øleeping in the du≈øt of the earth‚Äîfrom the po≈ø≈øibility, that an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite part of future happine≈øs will ari≈øe from review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, along with <hi>pre≈øent</hi> friends, the trials, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ≈øorrows, which we overcame, along
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023176_0293_0FBDDE0C69042EE0"/>with them, upon earth‚Äîand, more e≈øpecially, from the attributes of God, which ≈øeem <hi>pledged</hi> to convince us, by, (as it were,) <hi>ocular</hi> demon≈øtration, that tho≈øe, who, we are well a≈ø≈øured, ≈øuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øervedly, in various methods here, are reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereafter, and that ≈øome guilty per≈øons, who wanted no pro≈øperities in <hi>this</hi> world, experience all the horrors of another.</p>
                     <p>To this doctrine, there is but one weak, and ill-founded objection; that witne≈ø≈øing the mi≈øery of friends, if they died in a ≈øinful ≈øtate, mu≈øt be a dreadful abatement of our own felicity. That is impo≈ø≈øible. The affection betwixt relatives <hi>here</hi> was implanted only for <hi>temporary</hi> purpo≈øes, and will, in ≈øome ca≈øes, cea≈øe after death. The only attachment, <hi>then,</hi> will be, (as the only <hi>rational</hi> one, <hi>always was,</hi>) to ≈øouls, that <hi>a≈ø≈øimilate</hi> in <hi>real wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, purity and goodne≈øs.</hi> We ≈øhall love, in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, even as <hi>God</hi> loveth, not with the weakne≈øs of pa≈ø≈øion or in≈øtinct, but the unchangable ≈øubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>order.</hi> 
                        <q>They, that do the will of our Father in heaven, will be our fathers and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our ≈øi≈øters and mothers.</q>

                     <p>How glorious and inexhau≈øtible a ≈øource of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs does ≈øuch a pro≈øpect open to the mind! With what rapture will a tender mother, who left a number of children behind her, with a thou≈øand, anxious apprehen≈øions for their ≈øafety, meet them in heaven, where their innocence is crowned, their trials are fini≈øhed, and their eternal happine≈øs ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured! With what dutiful tran≈øports will children embrace the religious parent, to who≈øe coun≈øels <hi>under Providence,</hi> they owe con≈øiderably their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent glorification! And what delight mu≈øt it give both parties to reflect, that death can, no more,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:023176_0294_0FBDDE0DE78412D8"/>divorce them from each other, nor a grain of ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row poi≈øon their cup of bli≈øs!

                     <p>
                        <hi>Another</hi> delightful idea of heaven is, that it will bring to <hi>maturity</hi> all tho≈øe amiable in≈øtincts, which were planted in us by the Deity, whil≈øt we were on earth, but from a multitude of ob≈øtacles, or the ≈øhortne≈øs of life, could not attain their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

                     <p>Our <hi>≈øocial</hi> in≈øtinct likewi≈øe, will, doubtle≈øs, have a <hi>≈øimilar</hi> gratification. People are drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into <hi>≈øocieties</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> by a ≈øimilarity of ta≈øtes, pur≈øuits, habits and improvements.

Thus, though holine≈øs and purity be the <hi>alone</hi> medium of <hi>admi≈ø≈øion</hi> into the≈øe ble≈ø≈øed man≈øions, yet ≈øocieties may be formed of people of ≈øimilar improvements and congenial ta≈øtes; of holy philo≈øophers, (≈øuppo≈øe,) naturali≈øts, divines, doubly endeared by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemblance, and carrying their various re≈øearches to perfection, in a world, where knowledge is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unob≈øtructed, and in the pre≈øence of him, from whom all wi≈ødom and all goodne≈øs flows.

                     <p>Thus much, at lea≈øt, may be fairly inferred, that the <hi>intellectual</hi> improvements, we have made <hi>here,</hi> will not <hi>peri≈øh</hi> in the <hi>grave.</hi> We ≈øhall, doubtle≈øs, in this re≈øpect, ri≈øe with the ≈øame views and <hi>habits of thinking,</hi> with which we died.

And, though a Boyle or a Bacon, would from an union in <hi>goodne≈øs</hi> only, be happy in the conver≈øation of the mo≈øt illiterate ≈øaint, yet, on all principles of <hi>analogy,</hi> it may, rea≈øonably, be pre≈øumed, that their bli≈øs could not fail to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely heightened by the ≈øociety of tho≈øe, who, like them, had ≈øpent a whole life in laudable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øtigations.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>grand</hi> idea is, that the "great I AM will be pre≈øent!" He, who is the ≈øource of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ble≈ø≈øings!

                     <p>
                        <hi>Here</hi> we are continually mocked with the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of happine≈øs, which, on trial, is always found checkered with ill.

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:023176_0298_0FBDDE13E83BF510"/>its alloy. Even the ≈øweet, engaging child and friend, dear to us, as our own ≈øouls, bring in≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable anxieties, and a thou≈øand unquiet apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions for their health, their innocence and peace. Every enviable acqui≈øition is followed with its trouble; every acce≈ø≈øion of fortune or intere≈øt, with its cares; and, in the height of <hi>≈øeeming,</hi> wordly bli≈øs, trouble, ≈øtill, will find, through various <hi>chinks,</hi> its moments of admi≈ø≈øion. But, in heaven, all will be unmixed, all will be perfect, all will be ≈øerene!</p>
                     <p>Such is my private opinion of heaven. Such is the paradi≈øe of my <hi>imagination.</hi> If it be innocent, I have a right to indulge it; if you think it <hi>vi≈øiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> you are at liberty to reject it. If it be an <hi>error,</hi> it is, at lea≈øt, a plea≈øing one; and, if it ≈øerves to comfort life, or excite us to any laudable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, it has its u≈øes in ≈øociety, and mu≈øt, <hi>ultimately,</hi> promote the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>I hope it is true, becau≈øe time, which di≈ø≈øolves all earthly things, is ever on the wing, and I wi≈øh to have my intimacy with <hi>you,</hi> perpetuated through immortality.</p>

We almo≈øt <hi>di≈ø≈øolve</hi> in hot, carpeted rooms, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of continually expo≈øing our bodies to the open air. We go to ≈øleep, when we ≈øhould be ri≈øing.

And <hi>factitious</hi> amu≈øements are vainly bidden to create tho≈øe ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which ≈øhould ari≈øe from exerci≈øe and air.</p>
                     <p>This may an≈øwer a <hi>temporary</hi> purpo≈øe, but, in the <hi>end,</hi> it would de≈øtroy the firme≈øt con≈øtitution. It is, in fact, undermining the very ground, upon which we ≈øtand, and digging a <hi>premature</hi> grave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feet.</p>
                     <p>To me, who follow nature, and am only a ≈øpectator of the bu≈øtling ≈øcenes around me, the≈øe things appear to have ≈øerious con≈øequences. When I look at fine, enervated ladies, I tremble, by a ≈øort of <hi>involuntary</hi> in≈øtinct, for the ri≈øing generation.</p>
                     <p>What a vigilant, <hi>≈øy≈øtematic</hi> care did the ancient legi≈ølators be≈øtow upon this ≈øex!

<pb n="151" facs="unknown:023176_0302_0FBDDE19E86BF620"/>whole circle of plea≈øures, ≈øtill there is a great void in the ≈øoul.</p>
                     <p>I was once, for five weeks at Bath, and recollect it with a mixture of gratitude and plea≈øure. It was particularly ≈øerviceable to my health; and, on the whole, made impre≈ø≈øions on my mind, that will never be era≈øed.</p>
                     <p>The very <hi>ride</hi> to this place wil amazingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive you. Worce≈øter≈øhire, at this ≈øea≈øon of the year, is one grand magnificent garden, who≈øe air is perfume, who≈øe ≈øcenery is blo≈ø≈øoms, and who≈øe walls are the ≈øpacious canopy of heaven. If you make Bri≈øtol in your way, I dare promi≈øe, that your curio≈øity will be amply gratified by a ≈øight of that ancient and exten≈øive city. Though the place, <hi>in it≈øelf,</hi> is low and dirty, yet the adjacent country is, perhaps, the mo≈øt picture≈øque and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in Britain. Clifton Hill is deliciou≈øly ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic; on one ≈øide commanding a full pro≈øpect of the city, and looking, on the other, towards that magnificent ocean, which brings the inhabitants all their merchandize and riches. At the foot of this eminence, you will de≈øcry the medicinal ≈øpring of the hot-wells, ≈øo celebrated for their efficacy in <hi>con≈øumptive</hi> ca≈øes. Here you will be ≈øhocked with a number of walking <hi>≈økeletons,</hi> who are yellow with ≈øickne≈øs, dying of con≈øumptions, and breathing in their ≈øighs, the emptine≈øs and vanity of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man things. Thus is no human plea≈øure to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed; and thus are thorns to be intwined with the ro≈øe.</p>
                     <p>King's We≈øton Hill, in the environs of this place, has lately been celebrated by a poet. But the copy comes not up to the original. Nature has painted better, than the bard. It is vi≈øited by
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:023176_0303_0FBDDE1B688B93E0"/>all ≈øtrangers not only for its <hi>own,</hi> magnificent beauties, and wonderful ≈øcenery, but as an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of beholding the ≈øea, which here opens, all at once, in a grand and unexpected expan≈øion, on the a≈øtoni≈øhed eye. If you are fortunate enough to have a fine day, you cannot behold a more ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime or ≈øtriking curio≈øity.</p>
                     <p>When you arrive at your journey's end, every thing will de≈øight you. Regular ≈øtreets, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent buildings, ≈øumptuous public rooms, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pro≈øpects, walls, hills, vallies, fountains, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, company, amu≈øements‚Äîall will proclaim, that you are at Bath. You will feel, that this is the <hi>paradi≈øe</hi> of Britain; and that the godde≈øs of health has <hi>here,</hi> more particularly, fixed her abode. The mind, it is true, carries its ≈øecret burdens with it, into every ≈øituation; but I know no place more calculated to efface melancholy impre≈ø≈øions, or do away tho bad effects of over exertion. The waters are a wonderful cordial to the ≈øtomach, and a powerful remover of that indige≈øtion, which, to the ≈øtudious and the fair of <hi>≈øedentary</hi> lives, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ≈øo very general a complaint; and the mind in≈øen≈øibly, lo≈øes its little, <hi>fanciful</hi> burdens in the <hi>general</hi> gaiety and ≈øprightline≈øs of the ≈øcene.‚Äî There are, it mu≈øt be confe≈ø≈øed, many <hi>invalids;</hi> but there are, likewi≈øe, multitudes of young people of both ≈øexes, who≈øe manners are very highly engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and who≈øe faces wear a perpetual ≈ømile.</p>
                     <p>The amu≈øements, to which you are admitted at a very moderate expence, are conducted with the ≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="153" facs="unknown:023176_0304_0FBDDE1CE7CF19E0"/>brilliant throng have their private vexations, and the heart its own bitterne≈øs <hi>within.</hi>

                     <p>The Abbey church plea≈øes <hi>me</hi> more, than almo≈øt any ≈øacred edifice, I have ≈øeen in the kingdom.‚Äî It has not the grandeur and <hi>magnificence</hi> of ≈øome others, but it is more calculated for u≈øe, and yields to none in elegance and neatne≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Lady H‚Äî's chapel is vi≈øited by all ≈øtrangers, as an elegant curio≈øity of the ≈øolemn kind, more perhaps, from the melody and ≈øweetne≈øs of the ≈øinging, than motives of devotion. The good woman, probably founded it in this bo≈øom of plea≈øure, with a view of calling ≈øinners of di≈øtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to repentance. Her intention was amiable; and her piety, though grounded on the narrow and intolerant principles of Calvin, is entitled to re≈øpect. When people openly give their-money, zeal, talents and labour to <hi>any</hi> cau≈øe, we may tru≈øt their <hi>≈øincerity.</hi> Nor ≈øhould critici≈øm expo≈øe the little <hi>involuntary</hi> errors of tho≈øe, who ≈øcrupulou≈øly act up to the dictates of their con≈øcience, and have thus literally, "left all and followed Chri≈øt."</p>
                     <p>Lady H‚Äî, it is ≈øaid, has much injured her private fortune by her religious genero≈øity; in building chapels, ≈øupporting preachers, and many other public, and private donations. Prudence, ≈øurely did not warrant ≈øo extravagant a ≈øacrifice. But it is not nece≈ø≈øary to expo≈øe a conduct, which ≈øo ≈øew will ever be di≈øpo≈øed to imitate. <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteou≈øne≈øs</hi> is not, by any means, the ≈øin of <hi>this</hi> age.</p>
                     <p>I was indeed, not a little di≈øgu≈øted with the preacher of the evening, on which I happened to be at her lady≈øhip's chapel. His di≈øcour≈øe was a <hi>violent,</hi> inflammatory harangue without elegance, rea≈øoning or connexion; and con≈øi≈øted, for the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:023176_0305_0FBDDE1E688CA168"/>greater part, of a ≈øevere abu≈øe of the e≈øtabli≈øhed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

We <hi>are,</hi> perhaps, <hi>too</hi> languid and remi≈øs in the di≈øcharge of our duty; but to expo≈øe with <hi>virulence</hi> and rancour, is not ≈øurely the method to <hi>reform</hi> us. Declamation or ≈øatire irritates. It is ≈øolid argument alone, mixed with love and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, which ≈øoften and converts.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe people have not the <hi>gracefulne≈øs</hi> of piety. They di≈øplay not in their looks or manner, or <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures,</hi> the "beauty of holine≈øs." A ≈øevere critic, perhaps, would accu≈øe them of ≈øpiritual pride, and give them this motto, <q>Stand from me, for I am holier than thou.</q> Their preachers appear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in general knowledge. They do not ≈øtudy force of argument or embelli≈øhments of ≈øtyle.‚Äî They are not, indeed, without zeal; but it is wild, extravagant and frantic.

                     <p>The Avon, which runs through this city, filled me with great ideas. Shake≈øpeare, Stratford, the

                     <p>I ≈øhould wi≈øh you to take a view of Prior Park, as a place which has ≈øo long been ≈øacred to ≈øcience and the mu≈øes. The late Mr. Allen was the Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas of his times. You cannot tread the ground about it, without recollecting many of tho≈øe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated wits, who were often invited to this ho≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table retreat, and entertained its po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor with all that luxury of ta≈øte and lu≈øcious flow of ≈øoul which genius in≈øpires.</p>
                     <p>A great character ≈øtamps an immortality on the places he frequents, or the hou≈øes he inhabits.‚Äî Prior Park will be remembered, when its elegance is mouldered. <hi>Fancy</hi> will plant a laurel round this man≈øion of ta≈øte, which will continue to be green when the man≈øion it≈øelf ≈øhall have crumbled into atoms.</p>
                     <p>You will much oblige me by a frequency of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whil≈øt you are at Bath. They will improve your own talent at the <hi>de≈øcriptive.</hi> To me they will give a more lively recollection of plea≈øures, which I once enjoyed. They will retrace upon my mind, agreeable ≈øcenes and images, which I have, <hi>formerly,</hi> beheld. They will intere≈øt an heart, that always vibrates to <hi>your</hi> plea≈øures or your pains. They will relieve ≈øpirits that are too much oppre≈ø≈øed by a variety of thoughts. <hi>Whil≈øt</hi> I read them, I ≈øhall forget, that I had ever a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or that I ever was unhappy.</p>
