            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MY Leiſure unfortunately concurring with the preſent Itch for Scribbling, which ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally prevails, has produc'd the following political Eſſay; and, as I have great Reaſon to believe that I caught this <hi>Cacoethes ſcribendi</hi> in your City, I ſhall make no Scruple of throwing upon your Hands it's firſt troubleſome Production. You will find very few Arguments or Facts, that have the Gloſs of Novelty to recommend Them. In a Subject ſo hackney'd They could not reaſonably be expected. All that I have aim'd at has been to give a regular Form, and more decent Dreſs to thoſe Sentiments which are every Day ſported by our Coffee-Houſe Politicians. It can do a good Cauſe no Harm to ſtate the ſame Facts in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Light, and dreſs the ſame Sentiments in different Language. From this neceſſary Variety, Information may be more eaſily and readily communicated.</p>
            <p>However inconſiderable the Merit of this Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may appear, as it coſt me three or four Days Labour, it ſhall, at leaſt, have the Honor of your Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and then undergo that Fate to which you may think proper to devote it.</p>
            <p>When firſt I took up my Pen, I meant no more then to commit to Paper, my looſe, undigeſted Thoughts upon the preſent State of our political Affairs for my own private Satisfaction; but in the Courſe of a few
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:010273_0003_0F7E48CBA27768F8"/>Pages my Imagination became ſo heated, and my Heart ſo deeply intereſted in the important Subject, that, ſeiz'd with a Rage of Patriotiſm, my unruly Pen, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to no Check, ſerv'd me as Teague's Legs ſerv'd their paſſive Maſter — fairly ran away with me.</p>
            <p>
               <q>At the End of my Race, I found ſomething like-Conſiderations upon the Rights of the Coloniſts to the Privileges of Britiſh Subjects, introduc'd by a brief Review of the Riſe and Progreſs of Engliſh Liberty, and concluded with ſome Remarks upon our preſent alarming Situation.</q> Such as They are I ſubmit Them to your Examination, but, at the ſame Time, for my own Security, claim that Partiality which your Friendſhip has ever ſhewn to, &amp;c.</p>

What State of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it may, at this Period, have obtain'd, I leave to be determin'd by thoſe, who have Talents better adapted, and Opportunities more favourable for ſuch Kind of Speculation. I only mean to take Notice of a few Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which may ſerve to regulate my Sentiments
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:010273_0004_0F7E48CCD48BC7E8"/>upon the preſent important Diſpute between Great Britain and it's Colonies.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of the Engliſh Nation, depreſs'd and broken by the Norman Conqueſt, for many Years quietly gave Way to the Rage of Deſpotiſm; and peaceably ſubmitted to the moſt abject Vaſſallage. I do not mean to inſinuate that before that Period, They ever enjoy'd a State of Liberty. The frequent Irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Danes and Saxons kept Them in a State of conſtant Confuſion. Each little, temporary Kingdom govern'd by a particular Policy of it's own, had it's Attention too much engag'd by it's encroaching Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to refine much upon the ſimpleſt Principles of Government. But, when the Norman, at one Stroke, ſubdued all South-Britain, the Weight of his Sword induc'd a general Acquieſcence to the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Meaſures. Disjointed as the Kingdom had been, by the Intruſion of foreign Powers, and indeed peopled by different Nations; a very conſiderable Time was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to produce a perfect Coalition. No ſooner was this natural Effect produc'd, and the Nation become one family united Body, connected by the ſame Ties and engag'd in the ſame Intereſt, but the ſuperior and more ſenſible Part, ſhew'd it's Averſion to the Tyranny of the Norman Princes, by the boldeſt Oppoſition; and laid the Foundation of our preſent Liberty.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Stages of feudal Government, the common People were reduced to ſuch a State of abject Slavery, that the Voice of Liberty could not eaſily reach their Ears. The Batons firſt felt the Weight of Oppreſſion, and, by a ſpirited Oppoſition, endeavour'd to reduce within reaſonable Bounds, the almoſt unlimitted Authority of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:010273_0004_0F7E48CCD48BC7E8"/>the Crown. At this happy Period, We may fix the Foundation of Engliſh Liberty. The common People, employ'd by their Lords, to effect their glorious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, grew every Day more intelligent. As They became acquainted with and intereſted in Facts, They naturally acquir'd ſuch a Habit of reaſoning upon Them, as ſoon ſerv'd to ſhew Them that nothing but Reſolution was requir'd to obtain a reaſonable Share of Freedom. Once acquainted with their own Importance, They never ſtop'd 'till They had ſecur'd the moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of thoſe Privileges which are now ſaid to be the Birth-Right of Engliſhmen. They obtain'd the ampleſt Charter as a Security againſt the Encroachments of the Crown, and eſtabliſh'd for themſelves an equitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Power of Legiſlation. The Prerogative of the King became limitted by the ſame Law, which ſecur'd the Liberty and Property of the Subject; and the more effectually to maintain their invaluable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, every County, City and Borough was to chooſe a certain Number of its Members to ſit in a general Aſſembly for the propounding and enacting, in Conjunction with the Barons, ſuch Laws as future Occaſions might demand. The Kingdom thus divided into the three Eſtates of the King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; the Policy of it's Government became every Day more refin'd and delicate. The People thus rais'd to ſuch a Degree of Importance, and jealous of their new acquir'd Rights, have, from Day to Day, for Ages paſt, ſucceſsfully diſputed, with the Miniſters of the Crown, every Point which might ſerve to confirm this happy Eſtabliſhment. While the Nation knew no Law but the Sovereign's Will, continual Diſſatisfaction
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010273_0005_0F7E48CD48D6A260"/>and violent Oppoſition kept alive the Spirit of Diſcord: But, when the Law of the Land was confirm'd by the Voice of every Freeman properly repreſented, it's Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was enforc'd by the united Power of the whole; ſince no Man could be depriv'd of Life, Liberty or Property, but by thoſe Statutes which He himſelf had fram'd.</p>
            <p>In this Situation of almoſt perfect Security, the new World was diſcover'd, and the Inhabitants of Great Britain, tempted by extraordinary Conceſſions from the Crown, and a Hope of future Advantage to Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Poſterity, left their native Country, to ſettle and cultivate a Deſart. They were not baniſh'd to America as a Puniſhment for any Crimes which They had committed, and by which They might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have forfeited the Privileges of Society. Far from it! — They left England as free Adventurers; and, bringing with Them the Obligation of Allegiance to their lawful Sovereign, brought with Them all the Rights of Engliſhmen. As They could not by any Act of their's diſpence with the One, ſo could They not relinquiſh the Other to the Prejudice of their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. The firſt Settlements were made under the Direction of the Miniſters of the Crown, and to ſome were given particular<note n="‡" place="bottom">Among the ſeveral Colonies whoſe Form of Government is ſettled by particular Charters, I am led to take Notice of that happy Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution eſtabliſh'd in the Province of Pennſylvania, from ſome very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Meaſures lately ſet on Foot to effect a Change of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Form which at preſent prevails, was granted by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor in the Charter of 1701 to the Petition of it's Inhabitants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling the original Charter, which had obtain'd the Approbation of the greateſt Politicians, merely to gratify their capricious Wiſhes. Enrich'd with ſuch immenſe Poſſeſſions, and veſted with ſuch extenſive Powers as almoſt put Him upon a Footing with a Prince of the Empire, Mr. Penn, in every Tranſaction, not only evidenc'd the greateſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Genius, but the moſt obliging Condeſcenſion to the fluctuating Humours of his firſt Adventurers.
<p>From this new Grant They receiv'd ſuch extraordinary Privileges, as ſecur'd Them the Enjoyment of more than <hi>Engliſh Liberty.</hi> Their Aſſembly of Repreſentatives, annually choſen by Ballot, have the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Privilege of ſetting upon their own Adjournment, and an abſolute Power to diſpoſe of the public Monies in what manner They pleaſe. Unmindful of all theſe ſingular Advantages, and blind to their own Intereſts, They have ſuffer'd an ill founded Reſentment againſt their Proprietor, encourag'd by the artful Management of one deſigning Man, to hurry Them into ſuch a Meaſure, as They may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after have Leiſure to repent. To acquire a Power of throwing upon their Proprietary what They conceive to be his exact Proportion of the public Burthen. — to extort from the Man who is the Object of their implacable Hatred, perhaps an Addition of £500 per. Annum to the public Funds, They would willingly reſign to the Miniſters of the Crown the abſolute Diſpoſal of the whole; and to effect the malicious Purpoſes of a few ſplenetic Individuals, They would ſacrifice the Intereſts and Happineſs of the whole Community. Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory cannot furniſh Us with a more amazing Inſtance of blind Infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; nor could any Man, with leſs Abilities than Mr. F—n poſſeſſes, have led a whole Province blindfold to Deſtruction.</p>
               </note> Charters of Privileges. The higheſt Encouragement which They receiv'd, ſcarcely
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010273_0005_0F7E48CD48D6A260"/>under their Situation tolerable; or but poorly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd the Inconveniences which They ſuffer'd.</p>
            <p>In the Infancy of their Settlement, before any cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Occaſion, requir'd more particular Regulations, They had the Common and Statute Law of England for their Guide: But, when their Labours had rais'd Them to conſiderable Importance, and the Emergency of Circumſtances requir'd it, They were allow'd to form different Aſſemblies of ſelect Men, as Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the Freemen of the different Settlements. The Crown had it's Deputy at the Head of each Colony,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010273_0006_0F7E48CDE06A9968"/>with a conſiderable Number of it's choſen Servants to form a Third Eſtate, veſted with the Powers and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Lords. Thus were the Intereſts of the Crown moſt effectually ſecur'd by this double Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in the two ſuperior Branches of the Legiſlature.</p>
            <p>As the firſt Settlement of the Colonies was not a Matter of national Concern; the whole fell under the Direction of the Miniſters of the Crown; and in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant State, all their little Diſputes, too crude and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to come regularly before any of the ſuperior Courts of Judicature, were brought before the Privy Council for a final Determination. The Conveniency of this Method of Proceeding, render'd it agreeable to the Coloniſts; who did not conceive all the Evils which it might poſſibly produce: And thus did the Privy Council uſurp a Juriſdiction altogether unconſtitutional. The laborious Inhabitants of theſe Settlements, had their Attention too much employ'd by their neceſſary Avocations, to examine much into the Minutiae of Government. A Form, in any Degree reſembling that of their Mother Country, ſatisfi'd their moderate Wiſhes; and, while They were encourag'd in their Purſuit of preſent Gain, They ſuffer'd Themſelves to be altogether directed by the Miniſters of the Crown. To preſerve an Appearance of Liberty, each little So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was allow'd to chooſe a reaſonable Number of it's Members, to meet in a general Aſſembly, for the propounding ſuch Laws as the State of the Colony might require; but, before any ſuch Act as might be propos'd by the repreſentative Body of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, could obtain the Force of Laws, They muſt receive the Approbation both of the Governor and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010273_0006_0F7E48CDE06A9968"/>Council; and even after all this, be laid before the Privy Council for a final Confirmation or Repeal. Diſadvantageous as this Form muſt appear to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Perſon, to highly were the Coloniſts affected with a Senſe of Duty for their Sovereign, that They never attempted to diſpute the Legality of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which had been ſettled by his Miniſters. They patiently ſubmitted to many Inconveniencies, rather than diſturb the publick Peace by a Remonſtrance of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. Their Trade not yet oppreſt by unreaſonable Reſtrictions, They chearfully exerted their utmoſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to promote the Intereſt of Great-Britain. The Produce of each different Colony was exported to foreign Markets, to enable the Exporters to pay punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the immenſe Quantity of Britiſh Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which They yearly conſum'd. In the Courſe of a ſucceſsful Commerce They even ſubmitted, without Murmuring, to Regulations fram'd by the Britiſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liment; and ſuffer'd the Expediency of the Meaſure, to prevent their examining into it's Legality. Indeed all ſuch general Regulations as could not be effected by the ſingle Powers of any one Colony, were willingly receiv'd from the Legiſlature of Great-Britain; from a Conſideration of thoſe Advantages which They brought to the whole united Body: But, when that ſame Legiſlature, unmindful of thoſe very Principles from which They firſt deriv'd their Power, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to bind the Colonies by the moſt injurious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive Act, They have met with an Oppoſition which They never could have expected; and that too from a Spirit, which Nothing but the Juſtice of the Cauſe could have excited. Warm'd with a Senſe of Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010273_0007_0F7E48D1173EAF00"/>for the preſent Attempt, They naturally extend their Enquiries to what is, <hi>or ought</hi> to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Colonies, agreeable to the Plan eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by their Forefathers. No Man will deny that the provincial Americans have an inherent, <hi>unalienable Right</hi> to all the Privileges of Britiſh Subjects. This Poſition taken for granted, let Us now ſee how careful our Kind Parent has been to preſerve from Violation thoſe ſacred Privileges. Let Us take a Review of that Form which generally prevails where the Conſtitution has not been ſettled by particular Charters; and, by comparing this with the Form, which, at this happy Period, is eſtabliſh'd in Great-Britain, We ſhall eaſily determine whether the Colonies enjoy the Rights and Privileges of their Mother Country. The Freemen of each Province are duly repreſented in an Aſſembly form'd upon the ſame Principles as the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; but then the Crown is doubly repreſented, by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating both the Governor and Council. The Council, generally choſen from the moſt conſiderable Perſons of of the Province, become the middle Branch of the Legiſlature, and are veſted with the Powers and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Lords. Proud of the Dignity annext to their Office, and fond of maintaining ſuch a flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Superiority. They naturally become Tools<note n="‡" place="bottom">The honourable Members of the Council, for the Province of New York, in a late very intereſting Debate, have prov'd that this general Maxim, tho' ſupported both by Reaſon and Obſervation, is not unexceptionable.</note> of that Miniſtry, upon whoſe Favour their very Exiſtence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; ſince, the ſame Power which rais'd Them to this exalted Rank, can, for a ſingle Act of Diſobedience,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010273_0007_0F7E48D1173EAF00"/>ſink Them into their original Obſcurity. The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo powerful a Part of the Conſtitution, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether upon the royal Mandate, is not the only Grievance. The Counſellors are generally taken from among the moſt wealthy and important, and the Society thus loſes the Weight and Influence of it's moſt valuable Members. The Lords indeed are of the ſame Creation; but, once created, cannot be diſpoſſeſs'd of their Rank; and naturally form a Body ſo reſpectable and independent, that They are with great Propriety and Safety truſted with the Liberty and Property of the Nation. Far different is the Nature and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Provincial Council! As a Branch of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, They can only be conſider'd as Creatures of the Crown; and, when ſitting as a Court of Judicature, no more than Judges during Pleaſure. With Officers ſo totally under the Influence of the Crown, how can the Subject confide the moſt valuable Bleſſings of Life? or how can They weakly think their Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ſufficiently ſecure, when We muſt reaſonably ſuppoſe that the Judge who is to determine upon both, dare not give a Determination, inconſiſtent with that royal Pleaſure by which He holds his Commiſſion. The Prerogative of the Crown thus carefully guarded, in a Manner inconſiſtent with the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and unwarranted by the Principles of the Engliſh Conſtitution; the Miniſters of the Crown are ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to effect one favourite Purpoſe, which They may hereafter make Uſe of for the Introduction and Support of the moſt arbitrary and tyrannical Meaſures.</p>
            <p>By one ſingle Stroke of political Legerdemain, They have unhing'd the whole Conſtitution. It was not
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010273_0008_0F7E48D2A71AF0C8"/>ſufficient to have our Judges moulded by the Hand of Power. The darling Privilege, of Juries, ſtill remain'd as a formidable Support of Liberty. At once to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretiate theſe Jewels of Engliſh Freedom, and reduce Us to a State of abject Dependence, the privy Council have erected themſelves into a Court of final Appeal. — of Appeal upon the <hi>Merits of the Cauſe.</hi> A Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo fraught with pernicious Conſequences, and ſo incompatible with the Spirit of Freedom, that it cou'd owe it's Birth to Nothing but the horrid Deſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Colonies to an abject State of Vaſſallage. No Miniſter of the Crown, tho' ever ſo warm in the Purſuit of this deteſtable Purpoſe, dare think of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſo precipitately, without the Aſſiſtance of that Power which ought to be the Guardian of Engliſh Liberty. How this has been obtain'd one cannot eaſily imagine, unleſs it has been by the groſſeſt Miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of our Conduct, and by exciting ſuch a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Jealouſy, as muſt, upon the ſlighteſt Examination, appear to be as unnatural as it is ill founded. That the Enemies to America have drawn upon Us all the Weight of Parliamentary Power, was clearly evidenc'd by the ſevere Reſtrictions upon Trade, before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent infamous Act for collecting a Stamp Duty gave the Alarm to the Sons of Freedom. What may be the Conſequence of the ſpirited Oppoſition which has been given to this daring Act of Oppreſſion, Time only can determine: But, whether we may obtain the invaluable Birth-right for which We now diſpute, or whether We may fall a Sacrifice to ſuperior Power, We ſhall have the Satisfaction of thinking that We have diſcharg'd our Duty to Ourſelves and Poſterity; and every Heart
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010273_0008_0F7E48D2A71AF0C8"/>dead to the Senſe of Freedom muſt feel the Juſtice of our Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The moſt juſtifiable Reſentment may hurry Men of warm Tempers, into the greateſt Extravagancies; and ſuch may have been committed on the preſent alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Occaſion: But He, who would, at this intereſting Criſis, aſſume the Character of Stoiciſm, and preach up Moderation to his Countrymen, may reaſonably be conſidered as no Friend to his Country.</p>
            <p>We need no Reaſoning to prove, ſince the Records of our own Hiſtory evidently ſhew, that every particular Branch in a mixt Form of Government is continually labouring to extend it's own Power and Influence.</p>
            <p>We need not be told that there has been a Time, when the whole repreſentative Body of the Nation, have been intimidated into the moſt ſervile Complaiſance by the Frowns of their Sovereign; nor, is any Thing more notorious, than that the laſt Century furniſh'd Us with a Houſe of Commons ſo bold and enterpriſing, that by extending the Signification of the Word, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,</hi> they gave it Power ſufficient to deſtroy the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the Crown and Liberty of the Subject.<note n="*" place="bottom">That the Miniſters of the Crown have, even in the Infaney of our Setlements, meditated for us a Form of Government, <hi>eſſentially dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> from that of England, and only calculated to anſwer their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous purpoſes, muſt evidently appear from the following very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Speech made by Mr. Commiſſioner Atwood upon the Trial of Colonel Bayard in New-York for high Treaſon. <q>I do not ſay petitioning the King is a Crume; but, <hi>it may be</hi> to petition the Houſe of Commons in the Plantations <hi>where the King govern, by Prerogative.</hi>
                  </q> State Trials, Vol. V.</note> If this be, as it indubitably is, the graſping Nature of Power, We cannot be ſurpris'd that the Miniſters of the Crown have endeavour'd to increaſe, in the Wilds of America, the Force of that Prerogative which is ſo ſtrictly limitted at Home; nor, that the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010273_0009_0F7E48D329266898"/>Parliament of Great-Britain ſhould ſtrive to extend it's Power to ſuch an unreaſonable Length, as to aim at Nothing leſs than the bringing within their abſolute Diſpoſal, the Lives, the Liberties and the Property of Millions to whom They owe no Duty, and from whom They have received no Truſt. Immoderate, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable as this Attempt may appear, it now no longer aſſumes a doubtful Face.—It's Meaning is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in every Line of the late Act for collecting a Stamp Duty. Some little Efforts have indeed been made before this; but, as They came maſk'd with the Appearance of public Utility, They were receiv'd without any great Reluctance.</p>
            <p>An Acquieſcence, founded upon Principles of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, was miſtaken for the Effect of a tame, paſſive Diſpoſition, ſuch as would qualify Us for the Slavery to which They intended to reduce Us. But to the Honour of my Countrymen, let it be eternally remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd, that the Spirit of Liberty is as warm and active in the Wilds of America, as in the more cultivated Fields of Britain.</p>
            <p>Before We have Recourſe to ſuch Meaſures for the Defence of our violated Rights as the Neceſity of our Situation may require, let Us firſt endeavour to prove that We have an equitable Title to thoſe Privileges for which We contend.</p>
            <p>Tho' born and bred in the Wilds of America, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010273_0009_0F7E48D329266898"/>ſeperated from our more poliſh'd European Brethren by an immenſe Extent of Ocean, yet do the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Provincial Settlements claim an <hi>unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Right</hi> to all the Privileges of Engliſhmen.—As Freemen, Subjects of the ſame Prince, They conſider Themſelves upon an <hi>equal Footing</hi> with the Freemen of Great-Britain. To ſuppoſe any Subordination would be deſtroying the very Spirit of the Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As Freemen, Members of an extenſive Society, They conceive Themſelves veſted with the Power of delegating a ſelect Number of their own Community, with ſufficient Authority to frame ſuch Statutes, as may be deem'd conducive to the public Good; firſt of all obtaining the Approbation of the Crown or it's Deputy before They acquire the Force of Laws. To theſe Delegates, properly choſen, They willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the abſolute Diſpoſal of their Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; as They are Members of the ſame Community, influenc'd by the ſame Intereſts, and conſtantly bear a Part of thoſe Burthens which They may think proper to impoſe. They very reaſonably imagine Themſelves entitled to the Benefits, and obnoxious to the Penalties both of the common and Statute Law, as it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd at the Time when their Anceſtors quitted their native Country; ſince the Coloniſts of the proſent Age claim, by Right of Inheritance, as great an Intereſt in the Settlement of thoſe Laws; as the preſent Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Great-Britain: But who will venture, upon the common Principles of Reaſon, to aſſert, that the Freemen of Great-Britain can veſt their Repreſentatives with the Power, arbitrarily to diſpoſe of the Property of their American Brethren?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:010273_0010_0F7E48D3EE0301C8"/>
We are told that the Coloniſts have no more Reaſon to complain of being bound by Laws to which They have not ſubſcrib'd by their Repreſentatives, than thoſe flouriſhing Towns in England, which ſend no Members to Parliament. The Advocates for the Extent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Power, muſt be not a little perplex'd when They would draw an Argument from an evident Defect in the Conſtitution;—a Defect which may be attended with the moſt fatal Conſequences, altho' it was the natural Reſult of that Fluctuation which marks the Progreſs of Time. If there be any Meaning at all in the Doctrine of Repreſentation, We cannot ſuppoſe it to be abſurdly partial—calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the moſt invaluable Bleſſings of Life for one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Part of Society, and, at the ſame Time leave the other at the Mercy of unlimitted Power.</p>
            <p>When this important Privilege was granted to the Freemen of Great-Britain, no one can doubt but the Repreſentation was intended to be general and ſtrictly impartial; that every County, City and Borough ſhould ſend to the General Aſſembly, a Number of it's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, duly elected, proportion'd to it's Rank and Importance: But by a Fluxation, which no human Policy can prevent, this Repreſentation, tho' in it's firſt Eſtabliſhment it might have been perfectly equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, became every Day liable to ſuch Changes as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the preſent Inequality. Antient Cities and Boroughs loſt their real Importance, and ſunk into Obſcurity; while others, in the Courſe of a few Years, became of the higheſt Value to the Community, by their extenſive Trade and Manufactures. Tho' the ſame Principles which firſt eſtabliſh'd this happy
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010273_0010_0F7E48D3EE0301C8"/>Syſtem demanded the ſtricteſt Attention to this Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Circumſtances; yet has the partial Policy of the Crown prevented it's receiving that Regard which is ſo evidently it's due.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters of the Crown, ever ſolicitious to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it's Prerogative, did, by no Means, chooſe to increaſe this Power of Repreſentation; but rather wiſh'd to leſſen it's Force, by having it lodg'd in ſuch Hands as might become moſt eaſily ſubjected to their Influence.<note n="*" place="bottom">To what can We ſo naturally attribute the preſent Coincidence of Miniſterial and Parliamentary Power, as to the Increaſe of this <hi>pernicious Influence?</hi>—an Influence which muſt very ſhortly affect the Liberty of Great Britain as well as that of America, unleſs it receives a ſudden and ſeaſonable Check! The Antient Boroughs reduc'd to a State of Obſcurity and Poverty become eaſy Purchaſes for the Tools of the Court; and the preſent Machiavelean Miniſter, refining upon a Syſtem eſtabliſh'd by his Predeceſſor Sir Robert Walpole, has with great Economy, bought up all theſe Bargains for ſuch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Army as have Talents fitted for the Support of his Party. There are undoubtedly many military Gentlemen who have Abilities to fill with Honour the moſt diſtinguiſh'd Stations: But, as a Friend to my Country, and jealous of every Thing which may endanger it's Liberty, I muſt confeſs, that I had rather ſee them upon the Parade at St. James's, than in the Parliament Houſe at Weſtminiſter. The military Members of the Houſe of Commons muſt be thought very improper Repreſentatives of the Freemen of Great Britain. Indeed They may, with great Propriety, be conſider'd as no more than <hi>animated. Puppets,</hi> directed by the arbitrary Hand of our great <hi>State Juggler</hi> who is ſure to evidence both the Extent of his Power and Policy, by puniſhing with a total Degradation any One who may dare to think, ſpeak or act inconſiſtent with that Plan laid down for the Rule of his Political Conduct. The Removal of General Conway from his military Command for daring to ſpeak the Language of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, muſt ſerve to convince Us, that, in the preſent Adminiſtration, the moſt violent and arbitrary Meaſures will be us'd to extend and ſupport this dangerous Influence.
<p>When I mention the <hi>preſent Adminiſtration,</hi> I mean to take no Notice of the many <hi>deluſive changes</hi> which have been made to blind or amuſe the World.</p>
               </note> This very naturally accounts for that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality which at preſent prevails in the Repreſentation
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010273_0011_0F7E48D4A4CB8E40"/>of England; and, from a Conſideration of this ſingle Circumſtance, no Man can, with the leaſt Pretenſions to Reaſon, aſſert, that, becauſe the Inhabitants of Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham and Sheffield are not repreſented in exact Proportion to their Number, Wealth and Importance, the numerous Inhabitants of all the American Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall not be entitled to any Repreſentation at all. Abſurd as this Doctrine may appear, it has lately been warmly ſupported by the refin'd Logic of our State Sophiſts; Who have, at a great Expence of Thought, elaborated for Us a Syſtem of VIRTUAL REPRESENTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, without allowing Us one Repreſentative, or any one Advantage which ought naturally to attend this happy Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The Members of the Britiſh Parliament can only be conſider'd as Truſtees for the Care and Direction of the Liberty and Property of their Conſtituents; and, of that They may at Diſcretion legally and conſtitutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally diſpoſe: But, with what Appearance of Reaſon, do They claim the Diſpoſal of Property with which They were never entruſted, or arrogate to Themſelves a Power to determine upon that Liberty which was never committed to their Care? Can the little, Self-important Member for <hi>Malden</hi> look upon Himſelf as a proper Repreſentative for the Province of Maſſachuſets; or reaſonably conceive Himſelf veſted
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010273_0011_0F7E48D4A4CB8E40"/>with more Power than could be transfer'd to Him from the venal Wretches by whom He was elected? Or can any Individual of the whole reſpectable Body, ſay, that He is duly qualify'd to repreſent any one of the Colonies? Has He receiv'd any Power—does He own any Obligation; or is He influenc'd by the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts? All theſe are eſſential Qualifications; and yet not one of theſe can He boaſt! How then can He ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly eſteem Himſelf qualifi'd to repreſent a Body of People by whom He was never appointed—to whom He owes no Duty; and whoſe Intereſts are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably incompatible with his own?</p>
            <p>I am very far from being an Enemy to Parliamentary Power. I revere the Houſe of Commons as the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Guardians preſiding over the Liberty of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents; but when I ſee Them graſping at a Power altogether foreign, and inconſiſtent with the Principles of their own Conſtitution; I could wiſh to ſee Them reduc'd within their natural Bounds, and would even ſhelter myfelf under the Wings of the Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. I would much more willingly ſee my Property arbitratily diſpos'd of by a privy Seal, than extorted from me by the unwarrantable Power of a Parliament; whoſe Members would naturally endeavour to leſſen their own Burthens, and gratify the ſelfiſh Wiſhes of their Conſtituents by ſacrificing to Them the Intereſts of the Colonies.</p>
            <p>As loyal and induſtrious Subjects We may expect impartial Favour from our Prince; who muſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably regard with an equal Eye the Happineſs and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of all his Dominions. An ambitious and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Monarch might poſſibly wiſh to extend the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010273_0012_0F7E48D58533A658"/>Force of his Prerogative over thoſe of his Subjects, Who, from the Weakneſs of their Situation, might not be able to oppoſe it's Progreſs: But, from the Freemen of Great-Britain, who already view Us with a jealous Eye, what can We reaſonably hope for, but the malevolent Influence of that Jealouſy, which would ſacrifice a Rival even in the Perſon of a Brother?</p>
            <p>Theſe Sentiments are unhappily confirm'd by incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Facts; and the ſlighteſt Examination of antient Hiſtory muſt ſerve to convince Us, that the Colonies of popular Governments have ever ſuffer'd the ſevereſt Oppreſſion, and groan'd under the moſt intolerable Slavery.</p>
            <p>A Heart the moſt animated with the Spirit of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, if directed by a Head fraught with the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, would naturally prefer the deſpotic Sway of one Man, to the arbitrary Influence of Millions. The One might be eaſily ſatisfy'd, while the other would remain ever inſatiable. By the one We might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect to be rais'd to the Happineſs of Subjects; but, by the other, We ſhould be actually confin'd to a State of Vaſſallage.</p>
            <p>If We have not moſt egregiouſly err'd in the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of our Principles, the World cannot be ſurpris'd at the Oppoſition which We have given to the unwarrantable Exertion of Parliamentary Power:—A Power, to which, if We once tamely ſubmit, We ſhall ſacrifice all the moſt valuable Privileges of the beſt eſtabliſh'd Society.</p>
            <p>If the Prince requires a Revenue for his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Purpoſes, the Parliament grants Him an ample One, from a Duty laid upon our moſt neceſſary Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010273_0012_0F7E48D58533A658"/>If the Exigencies of Government require £ 300, 000, the Parliament will raiſe £ 400, 000 by a Stamp Duty. If our Exportations interfere with the Commerce of Great-Britain, the Parliament paſſes a reſtaining Law; and thus, by a regular Progreſſion of the ſame unlimitted Power, We may, with equal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Reaſon, be deny'd the common Benefits of Life. They may ruin our Trade—drain all our Sources of Wealth; and, after binding our uſeleſs Hands, leave Us at the Mercy of our ſavage Neighbours.</p>
            <p>It may indeed be objected, that We cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuppoſe a Proceeding ſo inconſiſtent with the true Intereſt of the Mother Country. But, has not the <hi>incomprehenſible Policy</hi> of the preſent Miniſtry given Us Reaſon to ſuppoſe that future Miniſters may be guilty of ſtill greater Abſurdities?</p>
            <p>With this unpromiſing Proſpect before Them, in what Manner ſhall the diſtreſt Coloniſts exert their little Power to reſiſt the Torrent of Oppreſſion?</p>

            <p>Upon the firſt Attempts towards the carrying into Execution this laſt deteſtable Act of the Britiſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Genius of America was ſuddenly awakened from her flattering Dream of ideal Security; and, with a Rapidity ſcarcely to be conceiv'd, communicated to her deluded Sons a juſt Senſe of their impending Danger. Alarm'd at ſo bold an Attempt to deprive Them of the moſt eſtimable Privileges of Society, in the firſt uncollected Moments of Reſentment, They could only evidence the Spirit of that Reſolution, and the Warmth of that Unanimity, by which They
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010273_0013_0F7E48D62265EC68"/>may hereafter raiſe Themſelves to ſome Degree of Importance, when their Motions may be directed by the Voice of Reaſon and Experience. The Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which They have already purſued have anſwer'd their firſt important Purpoſe—the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the immediate Execution of the Act. They were too warm to look forward to ultimate Conſequences. They felt too ſenſibly to reaſon coolly; nor could They readily conceive, that, after going the Lengths which They had proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would ſtill be neceſſary to go one Step further. The firſt grand Point gain'd by the Reſignation of the Stamp-Officers, They are too much elated with their ſudden Succeſs, to conſider, that, while They ſuffer'd the Pains and Penalties of the Act, to deter Them from Proceeding in the uſual Courſe of Buſineſs, They were giving it ſufficient Force to effect it's pernicious Purpoſes. The general Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation in a commercial Body, cannot be long obſtructed without inducing the moſt fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; nor could the Enemies of America have fallen upon any Method which would more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally anſwer their Ends.</p>
            <p>We have already ſhewn that the Spirit of Liberty is not confin'd to the Shores of Britain. Let Us now endeavour to ſupport that Spirit, by ſuch a prudential Meaſure as ſhall ſerve to prove it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd Nature; and, at the ſame Time, give Us a more reaſonable Hope of effecting our other
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010273_0014_0F7E48D708EE8F60"/>Purpoſes. Let Us at once boldly plead to the Juriſdiction of Parliament.—Let Us totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow the Force of that Act ſo evidently calculated to enſlave Us; and unanimouſly proceed in the Courſe of our <hi>internal</hi> Buſineſs as if no ſuch Act had ever paſs'd. To appear irreſolute in a Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch high Importance, will give the greateſt Advantage to the Enemies of American Freedom. The leaſt Appearance of Timidity will encourage Them in the Proſecution of their horrid Deſigns upon our Liberty; and, to ſhew any Doubt of our being able to ſupport the Steps We have already taken, will offer ſuch a Proof of future Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence, as muſt be highly grateful to the Promoters of this odious Act.</p>
            <p>In purſuing a Meaſure ſo well calculated to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Purpoſes of Oppoſition, the Officers of Government will find Themſelves moſt obnoxious to the Pains and Penalties of the Act; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently will not chooſe to engage in the general Diſpute upon ſuch unequal Terms They cannot willingly think of involving Themſelves in a Game, where their Stake is ſo much greater than that of their Fellow Adventurers; and where the Prize which They might gain, wou'd not be more than equal. But, ſhall We ſuffer this <hi>partial Policy</hi> of a few Individuals to interfere with the public Good; when the ſame ſpirited Conduct which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010273_0014_0F7E48D708EE8F60"/>oblig'd the Collectors of the Stamp Duty to reſign, would ſecure a ready Compliance from the Officers of Government; and once more ſet the whole politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Machine in Motion?</p>
