            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO beſtow a reſpectful tribute on departed worth, and to cheriſh the precious memory of our greateſt human benefactor, is the urgent duty, which our grateful and afflicted hearts now dictate and impel us to perform. The melancholy tidings of the <hi>death</hi> of Waſhington, which were announced to us, the laſt week, call us to take a part in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſo univerſally felt and deplored.</p>
            <p>WHILE we, with theſe emblems of mourning,<note n="*" place="bottom">THE pulpit was clad in the veſture of mourning. This early notice taken by the inhabitants, of the death of the beloved WASHINGTON, is an honorable teſtimony of their reſpect to his memory.</note> pay a reſpectful tribute to his memory, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm him in our hearts, it becometh us ſuitably to notice and improve this diſpenſation of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037426_0004_100D40BB8DFD67D8"/>
ſo afflictive, and ſo fruitful of inſtruction to us all. To evince the ſorrow we feel, in this diſtreſſing event, and our readineſs to contribute what is in our power, in honoring the memory and perpetuating the example of this moſt eſtimable and amiable man, we ſhall improve and apply the words before us.</p>
            <p>IN all ages of the world, monuments of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſame have been raiſed, and funeral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors paid, to the memory of great and good men. But no one, I preſume, can be found in the records of profane hiſtory, who has been more truly great and good, and more deſerving ſuch honorable tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, than our late much loved WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>ALL, who have had ears to hear, eyes to ſee, underſtandings to comprehend, or honeſty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, muſt acknowledge and admire the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary talents, the great achievements, the brilliant virtues and the benevolent ſervices, of the deliverer and guide of this American Nation. And if the children of Iſreal had occaſion to deplore the loſs of Moſes, well may America weep for the death of her WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>THE text intimates the duty of paying a juſt tribute to character: of ſuitably mourning, the loſs of the wiſe and good. The words expreſs the weeping and mourning, which the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael manifeſted for the loſs of their illuſtrious lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The life of Moſes was continued uſeful and important to them even to its laſt hour; when <hi>he died his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</hi>

HE was raiſed up, to be the inſtrument of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed medium of their bleſſings, as the favorite people of God, and of their preſervation as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as a General, Politician and Lawgiver, the world had never beheld his equal. With the enemies, they were called to encounter; in their unparalleled journey through the dreary deſert; and in the adminiſtration of their laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſee Moſes at their head. However vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous their ſucceſs, he was a ſharer with them. He partook in their misfortunes as well as in their victories; in their diſtreſſes, as well as in their joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intervals; in their alternate periods of depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and elevation; and was with them through the whole ſeries of adverſe and proſperous events, that ſucceſſively awaited them, from Egypt to Jordan, and on him devolved the reſponſibility of a moſt ſacred and important truſt. And when he had faithfully and ſucceſsfully diſcharged his duty, and as an inſtrument in the hands of Jehovah, had diſpenſed incalculable good to his countrymen, he was taken from them, at a moment, they were to enjoy the promiſed and procured inheritance.—And well might they weep for him. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his eminent ſervices, and the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the privileges and bleſſings he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in procuring for them, uniting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, the thought of the loſs of their guide, muſt have greatly increaſed the affliction of a ſeparation. He had become endeared to them, by every tie of obligation and gratitude, and their attachment to him was interwoven with the firſt affections of their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037426_0006_100D40BEC19B8790"/>
hearts. Though his departure by death was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, they had been taught to expect; yet when they were called to realize the ſeparation, they were greatly afflicted, <hi>they wept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOSES had been forewarned of his approaching end; though he had lived to ſee his people enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the enjoyment of their inheritance; yet it was the decree of God, that he ſhould not live to enjoy the inheritance with them. The period of his diſſolution now drawing nigh, and deſirous of taking his leave of them, in a manner correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a life that had been devoted to their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, he aſſembled them in the plains of Moab, and there enumerated the many ſignal interpoſitions of Providence in their behalf. He alſo reminded them of their laws and peculiar duties, and encouraged them to perſeverance and fidelity, with the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, "that if they kept God's commandments, bleſſings would be ſhowered down upon them, but if they neglected them, calamities would befall them." Having thus performed the various offices of his great truſt, and having prepared for his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome important counſels and inſtructions for their future conduct, as the beſt legacy he could leave, he then took a ſolemn and affecting farewell of them. He then retired to the <hi>Mount,</hi> from whence he could view the promiſed land and the countries round about. Uniting with his delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful view, the conſideration of having conducted his countrymen to the enjoyment of their inheritance, he muſt have enjoyed a noble, a rich reward for all his cares and labour. "He then reſigned his ſoul
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037426_0007_100D40C0F7031970"/>
into the hands of angels, waiting to convey it to the heavenly Canaan."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Children of Iſrael wept for Moſes, in the Plains of Moab.</hi> Such were the peculiar and affecting circumſtances, which occaſioned theſe words; words, which the ſacred hiſtorian has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as commemorative of the affectionate tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of a grateful people, and the funeral honors paid by them, to the memory of their guide and benefactor.</p>
            <p>IN this tranſient view of the character in which Moſes was appointed to act and conduct as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer and leader of his nation, we ſee a ſtriking reſemblance to the part, which Waſhington has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, in behalf of this American Iſrael. In hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a man as our deliverer, our guide and our head, is an excluſive privilege, which we can glory in, as the Children of Iſrael did, "above all the other nations of the earth." As the deliverer and political ſaviour of our nation, he has been the ſame to us, as Moſes was to the Children of Iſrael. He was early raiſed up, by Divine Providence, to eſpouſe the cauſe of freedom, to infuſe into our breaſts the invincible love of our country—to unite us in its defence, and to become the great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of delivering us from oppreſſion and bondage, and of giving us liberty and independence. And will it be too much for me to ſay, that the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can nation, with their Waſhington, emancipated and made free and happy by him, ſhall be handed down to diſtant poſterity, and perpetuated with as much fame and glory, in the annals of profane hiſtory, as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037426_0008_100D40C2A3997AC8"/>
the Children of Iſrael, with their Moſes, are cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the ſacred writings.</p>
            <p>VAIN and fruitleſs would be the attempt to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit a juſt delineation of Waſhington's character. In drawing it off, much of the original would be loſt.</p>
            <p>SUCH an aſſemblage of talents and virtues, ſuch a coincidence of circumſtances and events ſo wiſely managed, ſuch peculiar opportunities ſo uſefully improved, accompanied with ſuch invariable inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, uprightneſs and purity of conduct, all iſſuing in ſuch happy ſucceſs and unclouded glory—but rarely fall to the lot of man, and ſeldom found united in the human character.</p>
            <p>WHETHER we view him in the field, <hi>as the man of war,</hi> in the cabinet, <hi>as the counſellor,</hi> in the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential chair as our head, or in the private walks of life, as a citizen, our admiration is equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
            <p>To determine true worth of character, however, we endeavour to aſcertain principles and motives, as well as to notice great actions, and beneficial ſervices. In this point of view, the character of Waſhington will bear the cloſeſt examination. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principle, guiding diſintereſted benevolence and true patriotiſm, conſtitutes an important, and may I not ſay, the leading trait, in his character. As the joint influence of theſe, is the foundation of every thing great and good in man; ſo it is the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis on which the dignified and illuſtrious character
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037426_0009_100D40C65794B670"/>
of Waſhington was raiſed. It rendered the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and influential exerciſe of his wonderful talents, ſtill more commanding and influential. Without religious principle, great abilities and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar opportunities are always liable to be pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to purpoſes of miſchief; nor is there any ſafety in committing power and truſt to their management. But where religious principle is eſtabliſhed and in operation, there we may confidently look for the moſt uſeful improvement of every talent, and the ſtricteſt fidelity in the diſcharge of every duty. The commanding and directing energy of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, holds a diſtinguiſhed place in the ſplendid character of Waſhington, and may be compared to that of the Sun in the centre of the ſyſtem, whoſe eſſential and conſtant emanations impart a benign influence, reſplendent luſtre and glory to the whole. In him, we behold the rare union and diſplay of unexampled calmneſs and magnanimity; of deep penetration and ſound judgment; of undaunted intrepidity and exemplary prudence; of invincible perſeverance and watchful circumſpection, in the execution of meaſures the wiſeſt and beſt, controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and guided by a prevailing principle of piety and diſintereſted benevolence. We behold him, making ſubſervient to his noble deſigns, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete government of all his paſſions, and every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource within the compaſs of his comprehenſive, diſpaſſionate and diſcerning mind; and devoting himſelf to his God, to the welfare of his country, and to the good of mankind. Some have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed important public ſervices, done great exploits, and made themſelves celebrated, from motives of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037426_0010_100D40C82062D908"/>
intereſt, pride and ambition. Honour, power, and extenſion of dominion, were their governing objects. But characters formed from ſuch views, are ſeldom maintained or ſupported long; the diſcloſure of their ignoble and intereſted deſigns, ſooner or later, becomes a great drawback on their real worth and fame, and tarniſhes all their glory.</p>
            <p>EXTRAORDINARY talents, profound penetration, diſtinguiſhed improvements, wealth, honour, power, or the glory of conqueſt, do not of themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the true characters of men, nor render them the benefactors of mankind. The end, to which ſuch peculiar advantages and opportunities are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, muſt be taken into conſideration. Their true eſtimate is formed, from the principles and motives which actuate and govern them; from the objects they have in view; and from the good they actually intend, and are inſtrumental in diſpenſing to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by their talents, opportunities and conduct.</p>
            <p>SOME, by ſeizing a fortunate coincidence of events, and the opportunities of the moment, have put themſelves at the head of revolutions, from ſelfiſh and perſonal views, to elevate themſelves to conſpicuous ſtations, and not from any regard to the cauſe they eſpouſe, nor to the good of mankind. Such popular leaders, void of religion, true patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm or humanity, have ſpread devaſtation and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage far and wide, waded through ſeas of blood, to the eminence they ſought, and have made, not merely thoſe they ſubdued, but even thoſe they led, the enſlaved tributaries to their ſenſuality and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Others alſo there have been, who performed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037426_0011_100D40C9B0B99648"/>
extraordinary ſervices for their fellow men, and then have exacted extraordinary compenſation, either by actaual <hi>demands,</hi> or by making uſe of their power for the ſordid purpoſes of their own aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>WHAT an intereſting contraſt to the characters of ſuch pretended patriots, is that of Waſhington! How inſignificant do they become, by the enviable compariſon! He tranſcends them, as the reality does the name, or the ſubſtance the ſhadow.</p>
            <p>IN this point of view, how vaſtly does he ſurpaſs even an Alexander and a Pompey, whoſe names are ſo celebrated in the annals of hiſtory. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the ſtrongeſt temptations and allurements, that power and elevated ſtation could poſſibly offer. An opportunity occurred, at the cloſe of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary war, which put his integrity and patriotiſm to the greateſt teſt. It evinced, beyond ſuſpicion, the purity of his principles and motives. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed ſtate of the country, occaſioned by the conteſt, rendered it impracticable to make that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate compenſation, which the ſervices of the brave officers and ſoldiers deſerved; diſſatisfaction conſequently aroſe, and a propoſition was made, not to diſband till their demands were ſatisfactorily requited.<note n="*" place="bottom">That the revolutionary army were prevailed on, peaceably to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and retire, is to be attributed principally to the perſuaſive ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of General Waſhington.</note> Enjoying the unbounded confidence of the people, whom he had delivered, and having, at pleaſure, the entire controul and direction of the views of the revolutionary army, Waſhington was
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037426_0012_100D40CC30FB65F0"/>
preſented with the opportunity, accompanied by every allurement, to make himſelf Sovereign of Empire, without even the appearance of uſurpation. The diſpoſal of his country was then completely in his power. Others, whoſe military career had not been ſo glorious, and whoſe temptations were not ſo faſcinating, have, at ſuch a moment, uſurped the reins of government, aſſumed the right of requital and eſtabliſhed their own power and authority.</p>
            <p>BUT power, in the hands of Waſhington, was ſafe <hi>He</hi> could employ it for no other purpoſe, but to defend the rights and liberties he had vindicated; <hi>he</hi> could devote it only to the welfare of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>How nobly great does he appear, in riſing ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to ſuch temptations! Diſplaying ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of piety, ſelf-government, integrity, patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and benevolence, his character ſtands unrivalled. After he had conquered his enemy, he could gain a ſtill greater victory, by conquering himſelf, and not permitting thoſe paſſions of human nature, which ſo commonly ſtain the characters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors and heroes, to have the leaſt influence over him. He thereby acquired additional glory to his character, in having exemplified the truth, that <hi>He that is ſlow to anger is better than the mighty, and be that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that taketh a city.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH a dignity and nobleneſs of mind, better conceived than deſcribed, he returned the power and commiſſion, with which he had been intruſted; declining compenſation for any part of his ſervices,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037426_0013_100D40CFE70384B0"/>
he retired, "refulgent in glory," to the private walks of life, a citizen with other citizens; and converting his military implements to the uſes of huſbandry, he cheriſhed the hope that he ſhould have no occaſion to learn war any more.</p>
            <p>WHILE, my brethren, we are thus viewing the principles and motives, which ſo evidently govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our beloved Waſhington, and which greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the worth of his illuſtrious character; do not thoſe peculiar ſenſations return, which were excited in many of your breaſts towards him, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the cloſe of the war? To whom, but to him, were your expectations directed, in the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful events of the year 1775?<note n="*" place="bottom">Amid the deſpondency occaſioned by the loſs of the brave General <hi>Warren,</hi> who was killed in the battle of Bunker Hill, Waſhington's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and acceptance of Commander in Chief, revived and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hopes of America.</note> Amidſt the various ſucceſs that attended the whole conteſt, through the courſe of ſeven years, was not the preſervation of the invaluable life of your Leader, the object of your unremitting ſolicitude and your moſt earneſt prayer? That he jeoparded his life in the fields of battle, for the ſalvation of his country; that he performed many warlike achievements; that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated all the deſigns of a formidable foe: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely reſcued and eſtabliſhed your rights, are circumſtances known and familiar to you.</p>
            <p>AND verily he was raiſed up, by the providence of God, to be our deliverer and leader: and in calling to mind the many important events, that have taken place, for twenty-five years paſt, events

that have contributed to lay the foundation and finiſh the ſuperſtructure of the American Republic, Waſhington is the firſt and principal perſonage that meets our view, and claims our gratitude. "Our guide in war, our head in peace."</p>
            <p>AND what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my brethren, but a true and ardent love of country induced him to be among the firſt, in the vindication of our liberties, and the foremoſt to meet a powerful enemy, with unequal, and then unorganized troops, amidſt countleſs diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, difficulties and dangers; and to forego thereby, the eaſe and enjoyment, which opulence and the tranquil abode of private life, were calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to beſtow?—But eſpecially having accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed our independence and peace, covered with glory and grey in ſervice, what, but the welfare of his country, and that love for it, which ſtill glowed in his breaſt, could have recalled him, once and again,<note n="*" place="bottom">He was twice choſen Preſident—firſt in 1789, and re-elected in 1793.</note> from his peaceful retreat, to accept the Preſidency of our confederate Republic, and to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the weight and unuſual cares of government, in a moſt critical and difficult juncture of affairs.<note n="†" place="bottom">During his adminiſtration, war with the Indians broke out; and alſo new difficulties aroſe in conſequence of the European conteſt. In regard to the former, his meaſures were effectual to the reſtoration of peace: and to the latter, in taking a poſition of neutrality, his conduct was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and pacific.</note> And when, by his wiſdom, prudence and example, he had aided the eſtabliſhment and guided the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our National Government, he once more retired to the ſhades of Mount Vernon, and there held himſelf in readineſs, at his country's call, to

aſſiſt in times of difficulty and threatened danger.<note n="*" place="bottom">He had accepted the appointment of Commander in Chief of the Armies of America—declining, at the ſame time, any pecuniary compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for his ſervice. In this office, he cloſed his life.</note> In his farewell addreſs to his countrymen, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impreſſed with the idea, that his death muſt take place before many years—that "he muſt ſhortly be conſigned to the manſions of reſt"—and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a wiſh to cloſe his life in that retirement, which had always been the favorite ſpot of his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. His farewell was accompanied, like that of Moſes to the Children of Iſrael, with the beſt legacy that "the father of his country could leave." It contains ſuch counſel and advice, as cannot be read too often, nor treaſured up and practiſed with too much care. "They are the advice and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted warnings of a parting friend, who could have no perſonal motives to bias his counſel." In that valuable inſtruction and advice, Waſhington though <hi>dead yet ſpeaketh.</hi> Yes—though <hi>dead,</hi> he liveth in his fame, in his example, in his virtues, and in the grateful remembrance of his country.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON, as in his life, ſo in the hour of his death, ſomewhat reſembled the celebrated leader of Iſrael. Like Moſes, <hi>his eye was not dim, nor his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force abated.</hi> His body and mind were unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by ſervice or by age; his life was important and uſeful to its laſt hour; and the <hi>Mount</hi> to which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037426_0016_100D40D728D49B30"/>
he had retired, became the place of his death and burial.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>He died at Mount Vernon, the celebrated ſeat of his reſidence, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on the river Potomack in Virginia. The diſeaſe, which arreſted him, was an inflammatory fore throat, and which, in the courſe of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours, terminated his life, on the 14th Dec. 1799, AEt. 68.</p>
                  <p>He was a native of America, and born in Weſtmoreland county, in Virginia, Feb. 22, 1732.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>IT becometh us, my hearers, to cheriſh his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious memory with gratitude and affection, and to conduct ourſelves in a manner, that would comport with his wiſhes, was his life ſpared and continued to us. Could we—But alas! Waſhington is dead! What unuſual ſadneſs has it already ſpread through every heart! What gloom, over every countenance! What mourning, throughout our land! <hi>My father! The chariot of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and the horſemen thereof!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ILLUSTRIOUS ſhade! If the country, thou haſt ſaved, has ſtill any ſhare in thy regard, or in any way can yet receive thy care or influence, let all her councils, meaſures and conduct be ſuch as thy wiſdom would dictate, and thy prudence guide. <hi>She</hi> now offers thee, the laſt tribute of honour and gratitude, for thy long inceſſant toil, care and labor. Though we can no more repair to thee, for guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the hour of danger, nor thou—come to our relief, "to ſnatch us from impending fate," to ſave our land from ſervitude, to lead our armies to vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and by thy ſkilful hand to conduct our nation in the aſcending grades of proſperity and glory; yet the ſons of America will never ceaſe to revere thy memory, to preſerve the grateful recollection of thy
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037426_0017_100D40D8B45C4FE8"/>
benevolent and heroic deeds, to imitate thy virtues and to perpetuate thy character and achievements from generation to generation!</p>
            <p>THE paſt ſubject, in connection with this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly event, teaches us that the death of great and good men is an occaſion of deep mourning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to mankind, but eſpecially to the people, to whom ſuch characters were more immediately uſeful and important.</p>
            <p>THE Children of Iſrael mourned for their guide, they <hi>wept for Moſes in the plains of Moab.</hi> And great was the loſs which they deplored. Scarcely leſs ſorrowful is the occaſion, or leſs afflictive the death now felt and deplored by this American Iſrael. The Children of Columbia now weep for Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in the plains of America. Nor is it a loſs to America only, but to the world: his name is gone forth into all the civilized nations of the earth. Such inſtances of pre-eminent virtue and patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, but rarely bleſs the world. What an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable treaſure, to a nation, are ſuch talents—ſuch experience—ſuch a heart—as Waſhington's! What a reſource—what a ſafeguard—in all ſeaſons of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional perplexity and danger! The privation of ſuch a character, is a loſs incalculable!</p>
            <p>WHILE we deplore his death, let us be thankful that he has been continued ſo long to us, and that ſo many bleſſings have been diſpenſed to us through his inſtrumentality. And as we have heretofore regarded the continuance of his life, as a token of divine favor towards us; ſo we are now reminded,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037426_0018_100D40DA767AB760"/>
that his removal from us is an evidence of divine diſpleaſure. The removal of ſo good, ſo great and ſo important a character is a frown of Heaven, on the nation, an awful reproof for its ingratitude and wickedneſs. Depriving a people of their guides, is withdrawing the inſtruments of their protection and proſperity, and conſequently preparing them for the divine judgments which are about to be execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them. Such was God's procedure with his ancient people, when they rebelled againſt him, as we are aſſured by the words of the prophet. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Lord, the Lord of hoſts doth take away from Judah and Jeruſalem, the ſtay and the ſtaff, the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, the prudent, the ancient, the honorable man and the counſellor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the ſtations and places of ſuch characters are made deſtitute, where ſhall we find others to fill them. There are no more Waſhington's in America—no—nor on the earth. <hi>He that wounds alone can heal, he that has made the breach alone can repair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2d. WE are alſo taught, my brethren, that there is no defence or ſecurity againſt the great and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal deſtroyer, death. Amidſt the vigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and extenſive uſefulneſs of the greateſt talents of the greateſt men, and in the ſplendor of their glory, death approaches, ſpreads its awful ravages, and cloſes the ſcene.</p>
            <p>How many wiſe and good, have been ſwept away with the preceeding generations! Many within our
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037426_0019_100D40DC0CB25DC0"/>
own recollection, whoſe departure from the world was an irreparable loſs! Communities have been deprived of their civil and moral guides; and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of their wiſe men and rulers. The ſhields of the earth, and the benefactors of mankind, muſt did, like other men—<hi>there is no diſcharge</hi>—<hi>Verily man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOON, my hearers, we ſhall all be tranſmitted to the world of ſpirits. We muſt ſtand in <hi>our</hi> lot, not only in this world, but alſo in the world to come. Let it then be our great concern, in our ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and character in life, to act our part well on the theatre of the world, that; at laſt, we may be approved of God, and found of our Judge in peace. And when the great drama of life ſhall cloſe, <hi>may we unite with the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, and come to Zion with ſongs and everlaſting joys upon our heads.</hi>
