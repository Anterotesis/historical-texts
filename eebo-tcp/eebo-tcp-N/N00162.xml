            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough I was not altogether negligent, in noting down such occurrences, respecting the present <hi>Warr</hi> with the Heathen in <hi>New-England,</hi> as came to my knowledge, in the time of them: yet what I did that way was meerly for my own private use, nor had I the least thought of publishing any of my <hi>Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

This was because the desperate Distress which the Enemy was in was unknown to us: for the <hi>Indians</hi> have since said, that if the <hi>English</hi> had continued at the Swamp all night, nay, if they had but followed them but one half hour longer, <hi>Philip</hi> had come and yielded up himself. But God saw that we were not yet fit for Deliverance, nor could Health be restored unto us except a great deal more Blood be first taken from us: and other places as well as <hi>Plimouth</hi> stood in need of such a course to be taked with them. It might rationally be conjectured, that the unsuccessfulness of this Expedition against <hi>Philip</hi> would embolden the <hi>Heathen</hi> in other parts to do as he had done, and so it came to pass. For <hi>July</hi> 14. the <hi>Nipnep</hi> (or <hi>Nipmack</hi>) <hi>Indians</hi> began their mischief at a Town called <hi>Mendam</hi> (had we amended our ways as we should have done, this Misery might have been prevented) where they committed <hi>Barbarous Murders.</hi> This Day deserves to have a <hi>Remark</hi> set upon it, considering that Blood was never shed in <hi>Massachusets Colony</hi> in a way of Hostility before this day. Moreover the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God herein is the more awful and tremendous, in that this very day the Church in <hi>Dorchester</hi> was before the Lord, humbling themselves by Fasting and Prayer, on account of <hi>the Day of trouble</hi> now begun amongst us.</p>
            <p>The news of this Blood-shed came to us at <hi>Boston</hi> the next day in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But the <hi>Indians</hi> came not thither according to their Agreement, whereupon Captain <hi>Hutchinson</hi> resolved to go further to seek after them elsewhere, and as he was riding along, the perfidious <hi>Indians</hi> lying in Ambuscado in a Swamp, shot at him and wounded him, of which Wounds he after dyed, and eight men that were with him were struck down dead upon the place. Captain <hi>Wheeler</hi> who was in that Company was shot through the Arm, his dutiful Son alighting to relieve his Father, was himself shot and sorely wounded, willingly hazarding his own life to save the life of his Father. The <hi>English</hi> were not in a capacity to look after their dead, but those dead bodies were left as meat for the Fowls of Heaven, and their Flesh unto the Beasts of the Earth, and there was none to bury them</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Hutchinson</hi> and the rest that escaped with their lives, hastened to <hi>Quabaog,</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> speedily followed, violently set upon the Town, killed divers, burning all the Houses, therein down to the ground, except only one unto which the Inhabitants fled for succour, and now also (as since we have understood) did <hi>Philip</hi> with this broken Party come to <hi>Quabaog.</hi> Hundreds of <hi>Indians</hi> beset the House, and took possession of a Barn belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, from whence they often shot into the House, and also at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to fire it six times, but could not prevail, at last they took a Cart full of Flax and other combustible matter, and brought it near the House, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to set it on fire, and then there was no appearing possibility, but all the <hi>English</hi> there, Men and Women, and Children must have perished, either by unmerciful flames, or more unmerciful hands of wicked Men whose tender Mercies are cruelties, so that all hope that they should be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For in the very nick of opportunity God sent that worthy Major <hi>Willard,</hi> who with forty and eight men set upon the <hi>Indians</hi> and caused them to turn their backs, so that poor people who were given up for dead, had their lives given them for a prey.

Also our Brethren at <hi>Connecticut</hi> afforded their Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Major <hi>Treat</hi> being sent to <hi>Hadly</hi> with a party of <hi>English,</hi> and some of <hi>Unkas</hi> his Men. The <hi>Indians</hi> inhabiting about <hi>Conecticut River</hi> pretended great fidelity to the <hi>English,</hi> and that they would fight against <hi>Philip,</hi> who it seems had been tampering with them in the Spring before the War broke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, endeavouring by money (<hi>i.e. Wampampeag</hi> whis is the <hi>Indians</hi> Money) to engage them in His bloody design against the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At first they were so far credited as to be <hi>Armed</hi> by the <hi>English,</hi> hoping they might do good service as the <hi>Monhegins</hi> and <hi>Natick Indians</hi> had done. But within a while their Treachery was justly suspected. Whereupon Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were sent (on or about <hi>August</hi> 25.) to demand their Arms. They were then gone out of their Forts, our Men searching after them, they sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly shot out of a Swamp, and after that an hot dispute continued for some hours. How many <hi>Indians</hi> were slain we know not, but nine English fell that Day, wherein this Providence is observable, that those <hi>nine men</hi> which were killed at that time belonged to <hi>nine several Towns,</hi> as if the Lord should say, that he hath a controversie with every Plantation, and therefore all had need to repent and reform their ways.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>English</hi> have a multitude of open Enemies more then when this trouble began, so that greater desolations are now expected.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>September</hi> I. the <hi>Indians</hi> set upon <hi>Deer field,</hi> (alias <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

That which addeth solemnity and awfulness to that Desolation, is, that it happened on the very day when one of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>Boston</hi> were seeking the face of God by Fasting and Prayer before him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

inasmuch as this news came at the conclusion of a day of Humiliation, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>the Solemn voice of God to New-England</hi> is still as formerly, <hi>Praying</hi> without <hi>Reforming</hi> will not do.

               </gap> how loth he was to disgrace the Throne of his Glory, but now he begins with the Sanctuary. As for <hi>Springfields</hi> misery it thus came to pass: Whereas there was a body of <hi>Indians</hi> that lived in a <hi>Fort</hi> near to that <hi>Town</hi> of <hi>Springfield,</hi> and professed nothing but Friendship towards the <hi>English;</hi> they treacherously brake in upon the Town, when a party of our Souldiers who had been there, were newly gone to <hi>Hadly.</hi> They killed several, amongst others their Lieutenant <hi>Cooper</hi> was most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Nevertheless there was a great mixture of mercy in this dark and dismal dispensation. For God so ordered, as that an <hi>Indian</hi> who knew what was designed the next day, ran away in the night, and acquainted the <hi>English</hi> therewith, whence they had time and opportunity to escape to an house that was Fortified; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wise in probability the Inhabitants had surely had their lives as well as their dwelling places cut off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 13. The <hi>General Court</hi> fat in <hi>Boston,</hi> during this Session, a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> was with the concurrance of both Houses appointed in order to a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of those Evils which have provoked the Lord to bring the Sword upon us, and to withdraw from our <hi>Armies</hi> from time to time. The Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Teaching Elders</hi> in the Churches was desired, as in a case of that nature, it was proper for them to advise and help according to God.</p>
            <p>There was a gracious presence of God with them in their consultations, all that were there with one voice agreeing in many particulars, in respect whereof <hi>Reformation</hi> should be, and must be: <hi>e.g.</hi>

That whereas excess in drinking is become a common Sin, meanes should be used to prevent an unnecessary multiplication of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, and to keep Town dwellers from frequenting Taverns: and that whereas Swearing hath been frequently heard, they that hear another Swear profanely and do not complain of it to Authority, shall be punished for that concealment. Also that some further care should be taken, that the fourth and fifth Commandments be better observed then formerly; and that there may be no more such Oppression, either by Merchants or day-Labourers as heretofore hath been; and that the Indian Trading-houses, whereby the Heathen have been debauched and scandalized against Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be suppressed; and that more care should be taken respecting the Rising Generation, then formerly hath been, that they might be brought under the discipline of Christ &amp;c.</q> These things were unanimously consented to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 19. The Conclusions of the Committee, respecting <hi>Reformation</hi> of provoking evils were signed, and delivered in to the General Court, who voted acceptance thereof, and appointed another Committer to draw up Laws in order to the establishment of the things agreed on. Now as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that famous Martyrologist Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ( in <hi>Acts &amp; Monuments</hi> vol. 2 pag. 669.) observes, with respect to the <hi>Reformation</hi> in K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th his dayes, that that very day and hour when the Act for <hi>Reformation</hi> was put in execution at <hi>London,</hi> God gave the <hi>English</hi> signal victory against the <hi>Scots at Museleburrough;</hi> so it was proportionably) with us. For that day when there was a vote passed for the Suppression and Reformation of those manifest evils, whereby the eyes of Gods Glory are provoked amongst us, the Lord gave success to our Forces, who that day encountred with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> at <hi>Hatfield.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> lost but one man in the fight (albeit some that were sent forth as Scouts were killed or Captivated) the Enemy fled before them, and ran into the River, many of them being seen to fall, but night coming on, it was in vain to follow them further. And after that day, the <hi>Western Plantations</hi> had little or no disturbance by them, but lived in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness all the Winter. All this notwithstanding, we may say as sometimes the Lords people of old, <hi>the Harvest is past, the Summer is ended, and we are not saved.</hi> The Sword having marched <hi>Eastward,</hi> &amp; <hi>Westward, and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> now beginneth to face toward the <hi>South</hi> again.

In the mean while, when the English had any ingagement with the Indians, wounded Indians came home to the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> especially after the fight at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> Octob. 19th about fourty wounded men were seen crossing the woods towards the <hi>Narragansets:</hi> also some (at least two Indians) from amongst themselves, came to the English, and told them that the <hi>Narragansets</hi> were resolved (if they could) to destroy the English: but they were loth to begin to fall upon them before winter, but in the Spring when they should have the leaves of trees and <hi>Swamps</hi> to befriend them, they would doe it: wherefore it was judged necessary to send out Forces against them, and preparations were made accordingly.</p>
            <p>There was some agitation amongst those whom it did concern, where a person suitable for so great a trust might be found as <hi>General;</hi> and that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman <hi>Josiah Winflow</hi>

               </abbr> who succeeds his Father (of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) as Governour of <hi>Plimouth;</hi> was pitched upon for this Service.</p>

Whilst they were upon this march, an <hi>Indian</hi> whose name was <hi>Peter,</hi> having received some disgust among his Country men, came to the English, and discovered the plotts of the Indians, told where they were, and promised to conduct the Army to them. They were no sooner arrived in the Narraganset Country but they killed and took captive above fourty Indians. Being come to Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi>

house, they waited some dayes for <hi>Connecticut</hi> Forces. In the mean while party of the enemy did treacherously get into the house of <hi>Jerem Bull</hi>(where was a Garison.) burned the house, and flew about fourteen persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Decemb.</hi> 18. <hi>Connecticut</hi> Forces being come, a March toward the enemy was resolved upon: <hi>Peter</hi> Indian having informed that the <hi>Body of Indians</hi> (only <hi>Ninnigret</hi> being one of their old crafty <hi>Sachems,</hi> had with some of his men withdrawn himself from the rest, professing that he would not ingage in a <hi>War</hi> with the English, therefore did he goe into a place more remote) was in a Fort about eighteen miles distant from the place where our Army now was. The next day, although it were the Sabbath, yet, provisions being almost spent by our Souldiers, waiting so long for Connecticut Forces, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of War resolved to give Battle to the enemy. The English Souldiers played the men wonderfully; the Indians also fought stoutly, but were at last beat out of their Fort, which was taken by the English, There were hundreds of <hi>Wigwams</hi> (or Indian houses) within the Fort, which our Souldiers set on fire, in the which men, women and Children (no man knoweth how many hundreds of them) were burnt to death. Night coming on, a Retreat was founded.</p>
            <p>Concerning the number of Indians stain in this Battle, we are uncertain: only some Indians which afterwards were taken prisoners (as also a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed English man that apostatized to the Heathen, and fought with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his own Country-men, but was at last taken and executed) confessed that the next day they found three hundred of their fighting men dead in their Fort, and that many men, women and children were burned in their <hi>Wigwams,</hi> but they neither knew, nor could conjecture how many: it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that not less then a thousand Indians Souls perished at that time. <hi>Nin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigret</hi> whose men buried the slain, affirmeth that they found twenty &amp; two Indian Captains among the dead bodyes. Of the English there were killed and wounded about two hundred and thirty, whereof only eighty and five persons are dead. But there was a solemn rebuke of Providence at this time, in that six of our Captains were stain, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz,</hi>
               </abbr> Captain <hi>Johnson</hi> of Roxbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Captain <hi>Gardner</hi> of Salem, Captain <hi>Davenport</hi> of Boston (son to that Captain <hi>Davenport</hi> who did great Service in the expedition against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in the <hi>Pequod</hi> war, Anno 1637.) Captain <hi>Gallop</hi> of New-London, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Marshal</hi> of Windsor, Captain <hi>Siely</hi> of Stratford, who dyed of his wounds some dayes after the fight was over. The three Captains first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, belonged to <hi>Mattachusets</hi> Colony, the three last to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> of <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony Captain <hi>Bradford</hi> (one of their faithfull Magistrates, and son of him that was many years Governour there) was sorely wounded, but God had mercy on him, and on his people in him, so as to spare his life and to restore him to some measure of health, albeit the bullet shot into him is
<pb facs="unknown:000220_0026_0FA36CCE883A1828"/>
still in his body. 'Also Captain <hi>Goram</hi> of <hi>Barnstable</hi> in Plimouth Colony <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>el sick of a seaver whereof he dyed.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Lord take away seven Captains out of that Army. Also four <hi>Leintenants</hi> were wounded in that <hi>Fort fight,</hi> so that although the English had the better of it, yet not without solemn and humbling Rebukes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. At night as the army returned to their Quarters; a great Snow fell, also part of the army missed their way, among whom was the <hi>General</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with his Life-guard. Had the enemy known their advantage, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued our Souldiers (and we have since heard that some of the
<hi>Indians</hi> did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly move, thatit might be so, but others of them through the over-ruling hand of Providence would not consent) when upon their retreat, they might easily have cut off the whole Army: But God would be more gracious to us. Here then was not only a <hi>Victory,</hi> but also a signal <hi>Preservation,</hi> for which let the Father of mercyes have eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>After this God seemed to withdraw from the English, and take part with the enemy. The next day the Indians finding but few English men dead in the Fort amongst their three hundred Indians that were slain, were much troubled and amazed, supposing that no more of ours had been killed; this blow did greatly astonish them, and had the English immediately pursued the Victory begun, in all likelyhood there had been an end of our troubles: but God saw that neither yet were we sit for deliverance. Wherefore <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> Forces withdrew to <hi>Stonington,</hi> and there being so many killed and wounded amongst those that remained in the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Country, also bread for the Souldiers being wanting, by reason the extremity of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was such, as that the Vessels loaden with provision could not reach them; therefore the army lay still some weeks.</p>
            <p>In this interval of time, the town of <hi>Mendam</hi> (Which before that had been for saken of its Inhabitants) was burnt down by the Indians.</p>
            <p>Now doth the Lord Jesus begin solemnly to fulfilt his word, in <hi>removing Candlesticks</hi> out of their places, because of <hi>Contentions,</hi> and loss of first Love. Surely when those places are destroyed where Churches have been planted, Candlesticks are removed out of their places. But to proceed, When the Army was just upon the Resolve to return home, because provisions were spent, God so ordered, as that a Vessel loaden with Victuals arrived, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was determined (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to pursue the enemy. Only it was thoughter necessary to desist from this pursuit untill <hi>Connecticut</hi> Forces could return and joyn with ours. In the <hi>interim,</hi> a strange sudden <hi>Thaw</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the midst of <hi>January</hi> (when in New-England the season is wont to be extream cold) that the snow melted away in a little time: the like weather hath rarely been known in this Land at that time of they year, albeit some of the first Planters say it was so above fifty years agoe: However this made
<pb facs="unknown:000220_0027_0FA36CCFB350B030"/>
wonderfully for the Indians advantage, for now they fled out of the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganset</hi> Country, and whereas they had been sorely straightned and distressed for victuals, now the snow being wasted, they lived upon Ground-nuts.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Army pursued them several dayes, overtook some of them, killed and took about seventy persons, were in sight of the main Body of them, and could they have held out to have pursued them but one day longer probably, this unhappy War had then been ended: but the Souldiers were tired with eight dayes March, and (having spent much of their provision whilst waiting for our <hi>Connecticut</hi> Brethren) their bread faild, so as that they were forced to kill horses and feed upon them.</p>
            <p>We have often carried it before the Lord as if we would <hi>Reform</hi> our wayes, and yet when it hath come to, we have done nothing: So hath the Lord car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried toward us, as if he would deliver us, and yet hath deferred our <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as we our selves have delayed <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then <hi>February</hi> 5. The Army returned to <hi>Boston,</hi> not having obtained the end of their going forth. It was easie to conjucture that the <hi>Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi> and <hi>Nipmuck,</hi> and <hi>Quabaog,</hi> and <hi>River Indians,</hi> being all come together, and the <hi>Army</hi> returned, they would speedily fall upon the <hi>Frontier Towns.</hi> And some of the Praying <hi>Indians</hi> who had been sent out as Spies, and had been with the <hi>Indians</hi> beyond <hi>Quabaog,</hi> brought intelligence, that a <hi>French Man</hi> that came from <hi>Canady</hi> had been amongst them, animating them against the <hi>English,</hi> promising a supply of <hi>Ammunition,</hi> &amp; that they would come next summer and assist them: also the Indian Spies declared, that there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, within such a time to burn <hi>Lancaster,</hi> which came to pass both as to the time and manner accordingly.</p>
            <p>For upon the 10th. day of <hi>February</hi> some hundreds of the <hi>Indians</hi> fell upon <hi>Lancaster,</hi> burnt many of the Houses, kill'd and took Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Rowlandson</hi> (the faithful Pastor of the Church there) had his House, Goods, Books, all burned, his Wife, and all his Children led away Captive before the Enemy.

Eight man lost their lives, and were stripped naked by the <hi>Indians,</hi> because they ventured their lives to save Mrs. <hi>Rowlandson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this good Man returned home (having been at <hi>Boston</hi> to intercede with the Council that something might be done for the safety of that place) he saw his <hi>Lancaster</hi> in flames, and his own house burnt down, not having heard of it till his eyes beheld it, and knew not what was become of the Wife of his bosome, and Children of his Bowels.

            <p>In the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> another small Army was sent out from <hi>Boston,</hi> under the conduct of that expert Souldier and Commander Major <hi>Savage,</hi> to seek out the Enemy, Connecticut Forces met with ours at <hi>Quabaog,</hi> and they marched together, but not following the direction of the (<hi>Natick</hi> ) <hi>Praying Indians,</hi> who were sent as Pilots, the Army missed their way, and was bewildred in the Woods.

               <hi>March</hi> 12. This Sabbath eleven <hi>Indians</hi> assaulted Mr. <hi>William Clarks</hi> Mouse in <hi>Plimouth,</hi> killed his Wife, who was the Daughter of a godly Father and Mother that came to <hi>New-England</hi> on the account of Religion, (See <hi>July</hi> 6.) and she her self also a pious and prudent Woman; they also killed her sucking Childe, and knocked another Childe (who was about eight years old) in the head, supposing they had killed him, but afterwards he came to himself again. And whereas there was another Family besides his own, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> house, the <hi>Indians</hi> destroyed them all, root and branch, the Father, and Mother, and all the Children. So that eleven per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were murdered that day, under one roof, after which they set the house on fire. The Leader of these <hi>Indians</hi> was one <hi>Totoson,</hi> a fellow who was well acquainted with that house, and had received many kindness there, it being the manner of those bruitish men, who are only skilful to destroy, to deal worst with those who have done most for them.</p>

               <hi>March</hi> 13. The Indians assaulted <hi>Groton,</hi> and left but few houses standing. So that this day also another Candlestick was removed out of its place.

<pb facs="unknown:000220_0030_0FA36CD18A1A2E80"/>
done accordingly; so that here is another Candlestick removed out of his place. This day also, Captain <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Scituate</hi> with a party of about fifty <hi>English,</hi> and twenty <hi>Indians,</hi> who were Friends to the <hi>English,</hi> pursued a small number of the Enemy, who in desperate subtilty ran away from them, and they went limping to make the <hi>English</hi> believe they were lame, till they had led them into a snare: for suddenly a vast body of <hi>Indians</hi> did encompass them round; so that Captain <hi>Pierce</hi> was slain, and forty and nice <hi>English</hi> with him, and eight (or more) <hi>Indians</hi> who did assist the <hi>English,</hi> and fought bravely in that engagement.</p>
            <p>How many of the Enemy fell we know not certainly, only we hear that some <hi>Indians,</hi> which have since been taken by the <hi>English,</hi> confess that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Pierce,</hi> and those with him killed an hundred and forty of them before they lost their own lives.</p>
            <p>Upon this Lords day another sad thing likewife hapned; for near <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> there were eighteen <hi>English-men</hi> riding to the Town, to attend the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worship of God on his Holy day. And although they were Armed, there were seven or eight <hi>Indians,</hi> who lying in Ambuscado, were so bold as to shoot at them. They killed a Man and a Maid that rode behind him, the English being surprised with fear, rode away to save their lives: in the mean while the Indians seized upon two women and Children, and took them away alive, so that here we have cause to think of Joshuahs wards, who said, <hi>O Lord What shall I say When Israel turns their backs before their Enemies?</hi> What shall be said when eighteen English-men well arm'd, fly before seven Indians? This seems to argue something of a divine for saking, and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in heaven against us. The next day those Indians were pursued, but when the <hi>English</hi> came in sight those barbarous wretches hasted to run away, but before that they knocked the two Children on the head, as they were sucking their mothers breasts, and then knocked their Mothers on the head: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless one of them was alive when the souldiers came to her, and able to give an account of what the Indians had told her. Amongst other particulars, they did affirm to her that there was a Body of about three thousand Indians (no doubt but in that they did hyperbolize) near to <hi>Deerfield,</hi> and that they had newly received a great supply of powder from the Dutch at <hi>Albany:</hi> men that worship <hi>Mammon,</hi> notwithstanding all prohibitions to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will expose their own and and other mens lives unto danger, if they may but gain a little of this worlds good.</p>

Some of the in habitants of <hi>Sudbury,</hi> being alarumed by what the Indians did yesterday to their neighbours in <hi>Malbury,</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending they might come upon the enemy unawares, in case they should march after them in the night time, they resolved to try what might be done

and that not altogether without success. For towards the morning whilst it was yet dark, they discerned where the Indians lay by their Fires.

            <p>In the beginning of <hi>April</hi> they did some mischief at <hi>Chelmsford</hi> and <hi>Ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,</hi> where a small party of them put the town into a great fright, caused all the people to fly into Garison houses, killed one man, and burnt one house. And to shew what barbarous creatures they are, they exercised cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward dumb creatures. They took a Cow, knocked off one of her horns, cut out her tongue, and so left the poor creature in great misery. They put an horse, ox &amp;c. into an hovil, and then set it on fire, only to shew how they are delighted in exercising cruelty.</p>

               <hi>April</hi> 9th, This day being the Lords day, there was an alaram at <hi>Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, cambridge,</hi> and other towns, by reason that sundry of the enemy were seen at <hi>Billerica,</hi> and (it seemeth) had shot a man there. This week we hear from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> that a party of their souldiers went with many of the <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quods,</hi> and <hi>Monbegins,</hi> and some of <hi>Ninnegrets</hi> Indians, to seek after the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and they killed and took captive forty and four Indians without the loss of any of ours: amongst whom were several of their <hi>Chief Captains,</hi> and their great sachem called <hi>Qudnonchet,</hi> who was a principal Ring leader in the <hi>Narraganset</hi> War, and had as great an interest and influence, as can be said of any among the Indians. This great Sachem was pursued into a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by one of <hi>Ninnegret</hi> his men, and there taken. Being apprehended he was carried away to <hi>Stonington,</hi> where the English caused the <hi>liquods</hi> and <hi>Monbegins,</hi> and <hi>Ninnegrets</hi> Indians, to joyn together in Shooting <hi>Quanon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet</hi> and cutting off his head, which was sent to <hi>Hartford.</hi> And herein the English dealt wisely, for by this meanes, those three Indian Nations are

become abominable to the other Indians, and it is now their interest to be faithfull to the English, since their own Country-men will never forgive them; on account of their taking and killing the Sachem mentioned: So that there was a gracious smile of providence in this thing, yet not without mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of humbling to us, in that the Sachem was apprehended not by English but by Indian hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April,</hi> 19. The Indians killed a man at <hi>Wrymouth,</hi> and another at <hi>Hing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> And they burnt down the remaining deserted houses at <hi>Malbery.</hi>

And whereas Capt. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> (a prudent &amp; faithful man) was sent out for their relief, with about seventy armed men, a great body of Indians surrounded them, so as that above fifty of ours were slain that day, amongst whom was Capt. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> and his Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Sharp.</hi> Also Captain <hi>Bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Also they took five or six of the English and carried them away alive, but that night killed them in such a manner as none but <hi>Salvages</hi> would have done.

               </gap>, whipping them after a cruel and bloudy manner, and then threw hot ashes upon them; cut out the flesh of their legs, and put fire into their wounds, delighting to see the miserable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of wretched creatures. Thus are they the perfect children of the Devill. What numbers the Indians lost in this fight, we know not, onely a Captive since escaped out of their hands, affirms that the Indians said one to another, that they had an hundred and twenty fighting men kill'd this day.</p>
            <p>The same day (as is judged fifty) Indians burnt nineteen houses and barns at <hi>Scit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At <hi>Boston</hi> there is a press in order to sending forth another Army to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the enemy; for we hear there is a great body of them near <hi>Malbury,</hi> (as his apprehended) of many hundreds.</p>
            <p>About this time, in <hi>Conecticut-Colony,</hi> Capt. <hi>Dennison</hi> with sixty Six Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers, &amp; an hundred and twelve <hi>Peqnoa-Indians,</hi> pursuing the common enemy, took and flew seventy and six Indians. Amongst the slain was the

Sachem <hi>Pomham</hi> his Grand-child, who was also a Sachem, and another Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem called <hi>Chickon,</hi> and one great Counsellour. They took and spoiled an hundred and sixty bushels of the Indians corn. None of ours either English or Indians that did ingage with and for the English, were lost when this exploit was done.</p>
            <p>In the month of <hi>April,</hi> many of the Eastern, Indians having been sorely distressed, and sain to wander up and down for meat, so as that they lived for some time upon no other food then the skins of wild creatures, which they soaked in water till they became soft and eatable, notwithstanding the outrages and murthers (for they have shed the blood of about forty seven persons) by them committed, they did in confidence of favour from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish come and submit themselves, alleadging that the injuryes done by them were grounded upon a mistake. For when a party of English came in Warlike posture upon some of their <hi>Webbs</hi> (as they call them) <hi>

Also they plead for themselves, that a Fisher-man told one of them, that the English would destroy all the Indians, and when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was made of another English man (thought to be more discrect then the former) he confirmed what the other had said, and that some rude En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish did purposely over set a <hi>Canos</hi> wherein was an Indian Lad; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a <hi>Squaw</hi> dived to the bottome of the River and fetched him up alive, yet that the Lad never came to himself again. It is greatly to be lamented that the heathen should have any ground for such allegations, or that they should be scandalized by men that call themselves Christians.</p>

This is a Token for good, being a great answer of Prayer. For by reason of her near relation to a <hi>Man of God,</hi> much prayer had been particularly made before the Lord on her behalf. Nevertheless did the Lord manifest his holy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, in as much as at <hi>Haveril</hi> and <hi>Bradford,</hi> a small company of Indians killed two men and carryed away a man and a woman, &amp; five Children alive.</p>

Our Forces which are abroad met with a party of Indians, and killed about thirteen of them, and had probably destroyed many more of them, had not an English-man unhappily sounded a trumpet, whereby the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had notice to escape.

            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 8. About seventeen Houses and Barns did the <hi>Indians</hi> fire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy at <hi>Bridge-water.</hi> About this time they killed four men at <hi>Tannson,</hi> as they were at work in the field, by whose death about thirty Children were made fatherless.

               <hi>May</hi> 9. A day of Humiliation by Fasting and Prayer, was attended in the Town-house at <hi>Boston,</hi> by the Magistrates, and Deputies of the General Court, with Assistance of so many teaching Elders as could be obtained. Al|
though many such solemn occasions have at times been attended informer years, yet it hath been observed by some, that God did alwayes signally own his Servants, upon their being before him in such a way and manner: And so it was now; for the very next day after this, a Letter came from <hi>Connecticut</hi> to <hi>Boston,</hi> informing, that God had let loose the <hi>Mohawks</hi> upon our Enemies, and that they were sick of Fluxes, and Fevers, which proved mortal to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them. And whereas a special request lest before the Lord this day, was, that he would (as a token for good) cause our poor Captives to be returned to us again, and particularly those that were taken from <hi>Haverit</hi> the last week, God gave a gracious and speedy Answer, bringing home those very Captives in particular, and many other, yea at least sixteen of our poor sighing prisoners, who were appointed to death, did the Lord loose and return unto us, within eight weeks after this day, and divers of them within three dayes after this solemn day of Prayer. There are who have dated the turn of Providence towards us in this Colony, and against the Enemy in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

seated themselves not far from <hi>Pacomptuck,</hi> and that they were very secure: so that should Forces be sent forth against them, many of the Enemy would (in probability) be cut off, without any difficulty. Hereupon the Spirits of Men in those Towns were raised with an earnest desire to see and try what might be done. They sent to their neighbours in <hi>Connecticut</hi> for a supply of Men, but none coming, they raised about an hundred and four score out of their own Towns, who arrived at the <hi>Indian Wigwams</hi> betimes in the morning, finding them secure indeed, yea all asleep without having any Scouts abroad, so that out Souldiers came and put their Guns into their Wigwams, before the <hi>Indians</hi> were aware of them, and made a great and notable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>aughter amongst them. Some of the Souldiers affirm, that they numbred above one hundred that lay dead upon the ground, and besides those, others told about an hundred and thirty, who were driven into the River, and there perished, being carried down the Falls, <hi>The River Kishon swept them away, that ancient River, the river Kishon, O my soul thou hast troden down strength.</hi> And all this while but one <hi>English-man</hi> killed, and two wounded. But God saw that if things had ended thus; another and not Christ would have had the Glory of this Victory, and therefore in his wise providence, he so disposed, as that there was at last somewhat a tragical issue of this Expedition. For an <hi>English</hi> Captive Lad, who was found in the Wigwams, spake as if <hi>Philip</hi> were coming with a thousand <hi>Indians:</hi> which false report being famed (<hi>Famâ bella stant</hi>) among the Souldiers, a pannick terror fell upon many of them, and they hasted homewards in a confused rout; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> In the mean while, a party of Indians from an Island (whose coming on shore might easily have been prevented, and the Souldiers before they set out from <hi>Hadly</hi> were earnestly admonished to take care about that matter) assaulted our men; yea, to the great dishonour of the English, a few Indians pursued our Souldiers four or five m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>les, who were in number near twice as many as the Enemy. In this <hi>Disorder,</hi> he that was at this time the chief Captain, whose name was <hi>Turner,</hi> lost his life, he was pursued through a River; received his Fatal stroke as he passed through that which is called the <hi>Green River,</hi> &amp; as he came out of the <hi>Water</hi> he fell into the hands of the <hi>Uncircumcised,</hi> who stripped him, (as some who say they saw it affirm) and rode away upon his horse, and between thirty and forty more were lost in this Retreat.</p>
            <p>Within a few dayes after this, Capt. <hi>Turners</hi> dead Corps was found a small distance from the River it appeared that he had been shot through his thigh and back, of which its judged he dyed speedily without any great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the enemy.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000220_0036_0FA36CD60A553F98"/>
Victory was not so great as at first was apprehended: For sundry of them who were at several times taken after this slaughter, affirm that many of the Indians that were driven down the Falls, got safe on shore again, and that they lost not above threescore men in the fight: also that they killed thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and eight English men which indeed is just the number missing. There is not much heed to be given to Indian Tellimony, yet when circumstances and Artificial arguments confirm what they say, it becometh an impartial <hi>Historian</hi> to take notice thereof, nor is it to be doubled but the loss of the enemy was greater then those Captives taken by our Forces abroad did acknowledge. Some other Indians said that that they lost several hundreds at this time, amongst whom there was one Sachem. I am informed that diverse Indians who were in that battell, but since come in to the English at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mich,</hi> say that there were three hundred killed at that time, which is also confirmed by an Indian called <hi>pombam,</hi> who faith that of that three hundred there were an hundred and seventy fighting men. Whatever the victory or success of that ingagement might be, it was the Lords doing, and let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone have all the Giory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May,</hi> 23. Some of our Troopers fell upon a party of Indians (about fifty in number) not far from <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> and flew ten or twelve of them, with the loss of onely one English-man. The Indians betook themselves to a River, and had not some Foot-Souldiers on the other side of the River, too sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly discovered themselves, probably there had been a greater slaughter of the enemy, who hasted out of the river again, and fled into a Swamp where there was no pursuing of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 30th. The enemy appeared at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> fired about twelve houses and barns without the Fortification, killed many of their Cattle, drave away almost all their sheep, spread themselves in the meadow between <hi>Hatfield</hi> &amp; <hi>Hadly.</hi> When upon twenty five active and resolute men went from <hi>Hadly</hi> to relieve their distressed Brethren. The Indians shot at them ere they could get out of the Bout &amp; wounded one of them. Ours nevertheless charged on the enemy, shut down five of six at the first volley near the River. Then they made hast toward the town fighting with a great number of the enemy, many falling before them. And though encompassed with a numerous swarm of Indians, who also lay in Ambush behind almost every Tree, and place of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, yet the English lost not one man, till within about an hundred Rod of the Town, when five of ours were slain; among whom was a precious young man, whose name was <hi>Smith,</hi> that place having lost many in losing that one man. It speaketh sadly to the rising Generation when such are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. After this the Enemy fled, having lost five and twenty in this fight.</p>

In these two last months of <hi>May &amp; April,</hi> besides the <hi>Sword of War,</hi> in respect of the Heathen, <hi>the Sword of the Lord</hi> hath been drawn against this Land, in respect of Epidemical Diseases, which sin hath brought upon us; Sore and (doubtless) <hi>Malignant Colds</hi> prevailing every where. I cannot hear of one Family in <hi>New-England</hi> that hath wholly escaped the Distemper, but there have been many Families wherein every one in the House was sick and ill-disposed. So as that there have been many sick and weak, and some are fallen asleep, yea some eminent and useful Instruments hath the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and made breaches thereby upon divers of the Colonies <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England.</hi>

               </abbr> Major <hi>Willard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Russel</hi>) who for many years had approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves faithful in the Magistracy. And the death of few such is as much as if thousands had fallen: yet many other righteous and useful ones are gone, leaving us behind in the storm. And amongst the common people, not a few have been carried to their Graves in these two last months. We have heard of no less then eight in one small Plantation, buried in one week, wherein also twenty persons died this spring. And in another little Town nineteen persons have died within a few weeks. We in <hi>Boston</hi> have seen (a sad and solemn spectacle) Coffins meeting one another, and three or four put into their Graves in one day. In the month of <hi>May</hi> about fifty persons are deceased in this Town. By which things, God from Heaven speaks to us and would give us to understand, that if the Sword will not reform us, be hath other Judgements in store, whereby he can suddenly and easily bring us down. The Lord help us to apply our hearts unto Wisdome, and make us thankful, in that he hath been entreated graciously and wonderfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Health unto us again.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> and beginning of <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> have been less-active in the pursuit of their mischievous designes against the <hi>English.</hi> Our reason whereof hath been, in that it was now their Planting and Fishing times for at this time of the year, they supply themselves with fish out of the ponds and Rivers, wherewith this good Land doth abound, and dry it against the Sun so as that they can lay up in store, for to serve them the year about. But it would have been no wisdome for the English to suffer them so to do. Wherefore about four or five hundred souldiers were sent out of this Colony, and as many (<hi>English</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> together) <hi>of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> to seek out and disrest the Enemy.</p>

And although there is cause for Humiliation before the Lord, inasmuch as the Sword is full drawn against us, nevertheless we are under deep engagement to make his praise glorious; considering how wonderfully he hath restrained and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the insolency of the Heathen. That Victory which God gave to our Army, <hi>December</hi> 19. and again <hi>May</hi> 18. is never to be forgotten: also in that divers <hi>Indian Sachims</hi> (especially their great Sachim <hi>Quanonchet</hi>) have fallen before the Lord, and before his Servants. And in that things have been no worse with us, since the year of trouble hath been upon us, that no more Indians have been let loose upon us, but many of them have been our friends; that no more <hi>Plantations</hi> have been made <hi>desolate,</hi> which nothing but the restraining gracious providence of God hath prevented, for the Enemy might easily have destroyed ten times as many Towns as they have done, had not he that sets bounds to the raging of the Sea, restrained them; yea, <hi>one whole Colony</hi> hath been in a manner untouched, saving that one small deserted Plantation therein was burnt by the Indians; also sundry Towns

that have been fiercely assaulted by the Enemy, having obtained help from God, do continue to this day, as brands plucked out of the fire, and as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the sparing mercy of God, although they have been in the fire they are not consumed. And God hath returned many of our <hi>Captives,</hi> having given them to find compassion before them who led them Captive, and caused the Enemy to entreat them well, in the time of affliction, and in the time of evil, and by strange wayes at last delivered them. He hath also sent in a supply of Corn from beyond Sea, this Spring, and before winter; without which we could not easily have sent out such Armies (however small and not worthy of the name of <hi>Armies</hi> in other parts of the World; yet with us they are Armies) as have been pursuing the Enemy. Its wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to consider, how that the Lord hath visited his People in giving them Bread, when a Famine was expected. And this Summer, God hath caused the showre to come down in its season, there have been showres of Blessing when some beginnings of a Drought were upon the Land. And sore Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases hath the Lord rebuked; whereas the <hi>small Pox</hi> and other <hi>Malignant</hi> and <hi>Contagious Distempers</hi> have been amongst us since this <hi>War</hi> began, God hath been entreated to have compassion on us, and to restore health unto his people. Moreover, we are still under the enjoyment of our <hi>Liberties;</hi> both Civil and Spiritual: for such causes as these, the day mentioned was observed (by order of the Council) as a day of publick.

They have brought in with them three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men besides women and Children.

This week also about <hi>two hundred Indians</hi> more came &amp; submitted themselves to mercy, in <hi>Plimouth Colony,</hi> being partly necessitated thereunto by the distresses which God in his holy providence hath brought them into, and partly encouraged by a promise from the Goverment there, that all such Indians; as would come in, and lay down their armes should have life and liberty granted to them, expecting only such as had been active in any of the murthers which have been committed. When these Indians were in the hands of the English, a certain <hi>Squaw</hi> amongst them, preceiving that it would be pleasing to the English, if the murderers were discovered, she presently told of one who had had a bloudy hand in the murthers which were done in Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> house <hi>March</hi> the twelfth, the Indian immediately confessed the Fact, only said that there was another who had as great an hand therein as he, which other Indian being examined, confessed; the thing also; and he revealed a third Indian Murderer, who upon Examination owned the thing, whereupon they were all three forthwith executed, thus did God bring upon them the innocent blood which they had shed. Also the Indians who had surrendred themselves, informed that a bloody Indian called <hi>Tuckpoo</hi> (who the last summer murdered a Man of <hi>Boston</hi> at <hi>Namasket</hi>) with about <hi>twenty Indians</hi> more, was at a place within 16 miles of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and manifested willingness to go and fetch him in, whereupon eight English with fourteen Indians, marched out in the night, and seized upon them all, none of ours receiving any hurt at this time.

            <p>To <hi>Conclude</hi> this <hi>History,</hi> it is evident by the things which have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, that our deliverance is not as yet perfected for the <hi>Nipmuck</hi> Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not yet wholly subdued: Moreover, it will be a difficult thing, either to subdue, or to come at the <hi>River Indians,</hi> who have many of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themselves, and are gone far westward, and whilst they and others that have been in hostility against us, remain unconquered, we cannot enjoy such perfect peace as in the years which are past. And there seems to be a dark Cloud rising from the East, in respect of Indians in those parts, yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Cloud which streameth forth blood. But that which is the saddest thought of all, is; that of late some unhappy scandals have been, which are enough to stop the current of mercy, which hath been flowing in upon us, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to let loose more Enemies upon us, so as that the second error shall be worse then the first. Only God doth deliver for his own Names sake: the Lord will not for sake his people for his great Names sake; because it hath pleased the Lord to make us his people. And we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to conclude that <hi>Salvation is begun,</hi> and in a gracious measure carried on towards us. For since last <hi>March</hi> there are two or 3000. <hi>Indians</hi> who have been either killed, or taken, or submitted themselves to the English. And those, <hi>Indians</hi> which have been taken Captive; (&amp; others also, inform that the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragansets</hi> are in a manner ruined, there being (as they say) not above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men left of them, who the last year were the greatest body of Indians in <hi>New-England,</hi> and the most formidable Enemy which hath appeared against us. But God hath consumed them by the Sword, &amp; by Famine and by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it being no unusual thing for those that traverse the woods to find dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Philip</hi> who was the <hi>Sheba,</hi> that began &amp; headed the Rebellion, his head is thrown over the wall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we good reason to hope that this <hi>Day of Trouble,</hi> is near to an end, if our sins doe not undoe all that hath been wrought for us. And indeed there is one sad consideration, which may cause humble tremblings to think of it, namely in that the <hi>Reformation</hi> which God expects from us it not so hearty and so perfect as ought to be. Divines observe, that whereas upon <hi>Samuels Exhortations,</hi> the people did make but imperfect work of it, as to the <hi>Reformation</hi> of provoking evills, therefore God did only begin their deliverance by <hi>Samuel,</hi> but left scattered <hi>Philistines</hi> unsubdued, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made head and proved a sore scourge to the Children of Israel; untill <hi>Davids</hi> time, in whose Reign there was a full Reformation, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

wil attend those that shall magnifie themselves against the people of the Lord of Hosts. It hath been observed by many, that never any (whether Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of others) did set themselves to do hurt to <hi>New-England,</hi> but they have come to lamentable ends at last. <hi>New-England</hi> hath been a burthensome stone, all that have borthened themselves with it, have been cut in pieces. The experience of the persent day, doth greatly confirm that observation, and give us ground to hope, that as for remaining enemies, they shall fare as others that have gone before them, have done. Yet this further must needs be acknowledged, that as to <hi>Victoryes</hi> obtained, we have no cause to glory in any thing that we have done, but rather to be ashamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded for our own wayes. The Lord hath thus far been our Saviour for his Names take, that it might not be profaned among the Heathen whither he hath brought us. And God hath let us sea that he could easily have destroyed us, by such a contemptible enemy as the Indians have been in our eyes; yea he hath convinced us that we our selves could not subdue them. They have advantages that we have not, knowing where to find us, but we know not where to find them, who nevertheless are alwayes at home, and have in a manner nothing but their lives and souls (which they think not of) to loose; every Swamp is a Castle to them, and they can live comfortably on that which would starve English-men. So that <hi>we have no cause to glory,</hi> for it is God which hath thus saved us, and not we our selves. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the time when the enemy hath fallen, we must needs own that the Lord hath done it. For we expected (and could in reason expect no other) that when the Summer was come on, and the bushes and leaves of trees come forth, the enemy would do ten times more mischief then in the winter season, whenas since that, the Lord hath appeared against them, that they have done but little hurt comparatively. Had there not been, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hand beyond all expect ation manifested, we had been in a state most miserable this day. Aslo if we keep in mind the means and way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our deliverance hath thus been accomplished, we must needs own the Lord in all. For it hath not been brought to pass by our numbers, or skill, or vabour, <hi>we have not got the Lord in Possession by our own Sword, neither did our own arm save <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> But God hath wasted the Heathen. by sending he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Angell amongst them, since this War began; and (which should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be an humbling consideration unto us) much hath been done towards the subduing of the enemy, by the Indians who have fought for us, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more then by the English. And no doubt but that a great reason why many of them have, of late been desirous to submit themselves to the English, hath been, because they were afraid of the <hi>Mohawgs</hi> who have a long time been a Terror to the other Indians. I have received it from one
<pb facs="unknown:000220_0056_0FA36CE507E88170"/>
who was returned out of Captivity this Summer, that the Indians where he was, would not suffer any fires to be made in the might, for fear left the <hi>Mohawgs</hi> should thereby discern where they were, and not them off.</p>
            <p>Now, as the Lord, who doth redeem Israel out of all his troubles, hath graciously and gloriously begun our Salvation, so let him perfect it, in such a way, as that no honour at all may come unto us, but that great glory may be to his own blessed Name for ever. Let him bring health and cure unto this <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and reveal the abundance of peace and truth: And it shall be unto him a Name of joy, a Praise and an honour before all the Nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that he will doe unto us, and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness, and for all the prosperity that he will procure. If wee hearken to his voice in these his solemn Dispensations, it surely shall be so. <hi>Not unto us O Lord; not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory for thy mercy and for thy Truths sake, Amen!</hi>

            <p>Since I wrote the preceding Narrative, I hear that there are who make a scruple of using the word <hi>Army,</hi> when applied to such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable <hi>Forces,</hi> as those which have been raised and sent forth by us, in the late War.

            <p>And Reason faith, that those <hi>Forces</hi> may pass for <hi>Armies</hi> in one part of the world, that will not do so In another. But my design in this <hi>Postscript</hi> is not to Criticize or Apologize about the use of a Term. There is another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greater importance, so. <hi>That which doth concern the the Grounds of this Warr, and the justness of it on our part:</hi> concerning which I shall here adde a few words. It is known to every one, that the <hi>War</hi> began not amongst us in <hi>Mattachusets</hi> Colony; nor do the Indians (so far as I am informed) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that we have done them wrong. And therefore the cause on our part is most clear, and unquestionable: For if we should have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Yea, all the world would justly have condemned us. And as for our Brethren in that Colony, where these tumults first hapned,'

            <p>I said at the beginning. I would not inlarge upon that Argument, which concerns the <hi>Grounds of the Warr,</hi> neither will I, because that would make the <hi>History</hi> too voluminous, contrary to my design. Nevertheless, inasmuch as some are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And lest yet they should be streightned, we ordered that <hi>Mount-Hope, Pocasset</hi> &amp; several other Necks of the best Land in the Colony, (because most suitable and convenient for them) should never be bought out of their hands, or else they would have sold them long since.

It may be remembred, that the settlement, and issue of that controversie was obtained and made (principally) by the mediation and interposed advice, and counsel of the other two consederate colonies, who upon a careful enquiry and search into the grounds of that trouble, found that the said <hi>Sachems</hi> Precences of wrongs and injuries from that Colony were groundless and false, and that he (although first in Arms) was the peccant offending party, and that <hi>Plimouth</hi> had just cause to take up Arms against him: and it was then agreed that he should pay that Colony a certain summe of Mony, in part of their Damage and Charge by him occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and he then not only renewed his ancient Covenant, of Friendship with them, but made himself and his People absolute subjects to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. and to that his Colony of <hi>New Plimouth,</hi> since which time, we know not that the English of that, or any other of the Colonies have been injurious to him or his, that might justly provoke them to take up Arms against us: But sometime last winter, the Governor of Plimouth was informed, by <hi>Sansaman</hi> a faithful Indian, that the said <hi>Philip</hi> was undoubtedly endeavouring to raise new troubles, and to engage all the Sachems round about in War against us. Some of the English also that lived near the said Sachem, communicated their fears and jealousies concurrent with what the Indian had informed: About a week after <hi>John Sansaman</hi> had given his Information, he was barbarously Murdered by some Indians, for his faithfulness (as we have cause to believe) to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terst of God, and of the English. Sometime after <hi>Sansamans</hi> death, <hi>Philip</hi> having heard that the Governour of Plimouth had received some informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against him, and purposed to send to him to appear at the next Court, that they might enquire into those Reports, came down of his own accord to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> a little before the Court, in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> last, at which time the Council of that Colony, upon a large debate with him, had great reason to belive that the information against him might be in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance true: But not having proof thereof, and hoping that very discovery of it so far would cause him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, they dismist him friendly, giving him only to understand, that if they heard further concerning that matter, they might see reason to demand his Arms to be delivered up for their security,
<pb facs="unknown:000220_0061_0FA36CE8C7FBFDB8"/>
(which was according to former agreement between him and them) and he engaged on their demand they should be surrendred to them or their order.

And indeed our Innocence made us very secure, and confident it would not have broke into a <hi>War.</hi> But no sooner was our Court dissolved, but we had intelligence from Lieut. <hi>John Brown</hi> of <hi>Swanzy</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> and his men continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in <hi>Arms,</hi> many strange Indians from several places flocked in to him, that they sent away their Wives to <hi>Narraganset,</hi> and were giving our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple frequent Alarums by Drums, and Guns in the night, and had guarded the passages towards <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and that their young Indians were earnest for a War. On the seventh of <hi>June,</hi> Mr. <hi>Benjamin Church</hi> being on Rhode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Island, <hi>Weesamoe</hi> (the <hi>Squaw-Sachim</hi> of <hi>Pocasset</hi>) and some of her chief men told him, that <hi>Philip</hi> intended a War speedily with the English; some of them saying that they would help him, and that he had already given them leave to kill English mens Cattle, and rob their Houses. About the 14. and 15th of <hi>June,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Brown</hi> went twice to <hi>Philip</hi> to perswade him to be quiet, but at both times found his Men in Arms, and <hi>Philip</hi> very high and not perswadable to peace. On the 14th of <hi>June,</hi> our Council writ an amicable, friendly Letter to him, shewing our dislike of his practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and advising him to dismiss his strange <hi>Indians,</hi> and command his own men to fall quietly to their business, that our people might also be quiet, and not to suffer himself to be abused by reports concerning us, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no hurt towards him; but Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> could not obtain any Answer from him.

The above expressed Letter and Narrative will (I hope) tend to remove Prejudices out of the spirits of dissatisfyed persons, touching the grounds of the present <hi>Warr.</hi> Some have thought that if <hi>Philip</hi> (the Ring leader of all the mischief &amp; misery which hath hapned by this <hi>War</hi> ) his solemn ingagement to the English, above four years before these troubles began, were published, it would farther clear the justice of the Warr on our part, and the more, in that he doth desire, that that Covenant might testifie against him to the world, if ever he should prove unfaithfull therein. I shall therefore here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn what was by him together with his Council, subscribed, (in the presence of sundry appertaining to this Jurisdiction) and doth still remain with their Names set to it, in the publick Records of the Colonyes.</p>
