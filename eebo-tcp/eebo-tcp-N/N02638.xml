         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>UNTO</hi> CHARLES <hi>II. KING OF Great Britain, And the Dominions thereunto belonging: ROBERT BARCLAY,</hi> A Servant of JESUS CHRIST, called of GOD to the Diſpenſation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, now again Revealed, and after a long and dark Night of Apostacy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be Preached to all Nations, <hi>Wiſheth Health and Salvation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS the Condition of Kings and Princes puts them in a Station more obvious to the View and Obſervation of the World, than that of other Men, of whom (as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves) neither any Word or Action can be obſcure; ſo
<pb facs="unknown:003129_0003_0FF003FA54463F20"/>
are thoſe Kings (during whoſe appearance upon the Stage of this World, it pleaſeth the Great <hi>KING</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> ſingularly to make known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men the wounderful Steps of his <hi>Unſearchable Providence)</hi> more ſignally obſerved, and their Lives and Actions more diligently remarked and inquired into by Poſterity; eſpecially, if thoſe things are ſuch, as not only relate to the outward Tranſactions of this World, but alſo are ſignaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Manifeſtation or Revelation of the Knowledge of God in matters Spiritual and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. Theſe are the things that render'd the Lives of <hi>Cyrus, Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, in former Times, and of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and ſome other Modern Princes in theſe laſt Ages, ſo Conſiderable.</p>
            <p>But among all theſe Tranſactions, which it hath pleaſed God to permit, for the Glory of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Manifeſtation of his Wiſdom and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, no Age furniſheth us with things ſo <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>marvellous,</hi> whether with reſpect to matters Civil or Religious, as theſe, that have fallen out within the compaſs of thy time; who, tho' thou be not yet arrived at the Fiftieth Year of thy Age, haſt yet been a Witneſs of ſtranger things, than many Ages before produced. So that, whether we reſpect thoſe various Troubles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou found'ſt thy ſelf ingaged, while ſcarce got out of thy Infancy; the many different Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, wherewith Men of thy Circumſtances are often unacquainted; the ſtrange and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd Fortune that befel thy Father; thy own narrow Eſcape, and Baniſhment following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, with the great improbability of thy ever Returning, (at leaſt without very much Pains, and tedious Combatings;) or finally, the incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb facs="unknown:003129_0003_0FF003FA54463F20"/>
thou wert under to accompliſh ſuch a Deſign; conſidering the Strength of thoſe that had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves of thy Throne, and the Terror they had inflicted upon Foreign States: And yet that, after all this, thou ſhould'ſt be Reſtored without Stroke of Sword, the help or aſſiſtance of Foreign States, or the contrivance and work of Humane Policy; all theſe do ſufficiently declare, that it is the <hi>Lord's Doing</hi>; which, as it is marvellous in our Eyes, ſo it will juſtly be a matter of Wonder and Aſtoniſhment to Generations to come; and may ſufficiently ſerve, if rightly obſerved, to confute and confound that <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> wherewith this Age doth ſo much abound.</p>
            <p>As the Vindication of the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> (which thy Father, by giving way to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Clamours of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the anſwering and fulfilling of whoſe unrighteous Wills, has often proved hurtful and pernicious to Princes, ſought in ſome part to reſtrain) was a great occaſion of the Troubles and Revolutions; ſo the Pretence of <hi>Conſcience</hi> was that which carried it on, and brought it to that pitch it came to. And tho' (no doubt) ſome, that were ingaged in that Work, deſigned good things, at leaſt in the beginning, (albeit always wrong in the manner they took to accompliſh it, <hi>viz.</hi> by Carnal Weapons;) yet ſo ſoon as they had taſted of the ſweet of the Poſſeſſions of them they had turned out, they quickly began to do thoſe things themſelves, for which they had accuſed others. For their Hands were found full of Oppreſſion, and <hi>they hated the Reproof of Inſtruction, which is the Way of Life:</hi> And they evilly intreated the Meſſengers of the Lord, and cauſed to beat and impriſon his Prophets, and perſecuted his People, whom he had called and
<pb facs="unknown:003129_0004_0FF003FD5B47EAD0"/>
gathered out from among them; whom he had made to beat their <hi>Swords into Plow-ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-books,</hi> and not to learn <hi>Carnal War</hi> any more: But he raiſed them up, and armed them with <hi>Spiritual Weapons,</hi> even with his own Spirit and Power, whereby they teſtified in the Streets and High-ways, and publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and Synagogues, againſt the <hi>Pride, Vanity, Luſts</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> of that Generation, who were Righteous in their own Eyes; tho' often cruelly Entreated therefore: And they faithfully prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied and foretold them of their Judgment and Downfal, which came upon them; as by ſeveral Writings and Epiſtles, delivered to <hi>Oliver</hi> and <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and other then <hi>Powers,</hi> yet upon Record, doth appear.</p>
            <p>And after it pleaſed God to Reſtore thee, what Oppreſſions, what Baniſhments, and Evil Entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they have met with, by Men pretending thy Authority, and cloaking their Miſchief with thy Name, is known to moſt Men in this Iſland; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>England,</hi> where there is ſcarce a Priſon that hath not been filled with them; nor a Judge before whom they have not been haled: <hi>Though they could never yet be found Guilty</hi> of any things, that might deſerve that Uſage. Therefore the Senſe of their Innocency did, no doubt, greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to move thee, Three Years ago, to cauſe ſome Hundreds of them to be ſet at Liberty: For indeed their Sufferings are ſingular, and obviouſly diſtinguiſhable from all the reſt of ſuch as live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee, in theſe two reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>In that among all the Plots, contrived by others againſt thee, ſince thy return into</hi> Britain, <hi>there was never any, owned of that People, found or known
<pb facs="unknown:003129_0004_0FF003FD5B47EAD0"/>
to be guilty,</hi> (though many of them have been taken and impriſoned upon ſuch kind of Jealouſies) <hi>but were always found Innocent and Harmleſs,</hi> (as became the Followers of Chriſt) <hi>not covering after, nor contending for the Kingdoms of this World; but ſubject to every Ordinance of Man, for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In that, in the betteſt times of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and the moſt violent Proſecution of thoſe Laws made againſt Meetings</hi> (being cloathed with Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency) <hi>they have boldly ſtood to their Teſtimony for God, without creeping into Holes or Corners, or once biding themſelves,</hi> as all other Diſſenters have done; <hi>but daily met, according to their cuſtom, in the publick places appointed for that end</hi>; ſo that none of thy Officers can ſay of them, <hi>That they have ſurprized them in a Corner, overtaken them in a private Conventicle, or catched them lurking in their ſecret Chambers; nor needed they to ſend out Spies to get them, whom they were ſure daily to find in their open Aſſemblies, teſtifying for God and his Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which, thoſe that have an Eye to ſee, may obſerve their Chriſtian Patience and Courage, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Suffering, joyned in one, more than in any other People, that differ from them, or oppoſe them. And yet in the midſt of all thoſe Troubles, thou canſt bear witneſs, That as on the one part, they never ſought to detract from thee, or to render thee and thy Government odious to the People, by nameleſs and ſcandalous Pamphlets and Libels; ſo on the other hand, they have not ſpared to Admoniſh, Exhort and Reprove thee; and have faithfully diſcharged their Conſciences towards thee, without Hattering Words, as ever
<pb facs="unknown:003129_0005_0FF004008309CD30"/>
the true Prophets in Ancient Times uſed to do to thoſe Kings and Princes, under whoſe Power, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or Oppreſſion was acted.</p>
            <p>And albeit it is evident by Experience, to be moſt agreeable both to Divine Truth, and Humane Policy, to allow every one to ſerve God according to their Conſciences; nevertheleſs thoſe other Sects, who, for the moſt part, durſt not peep out in the Times of Perſecution, while theſe Innocent People ſtood bold and faithful, do now combine in a joynt Confederacy (notwithſtanding all the former Janglings and Contentions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) to render us odious; ſeeking unjuſtly to wreſt our Doctrine and Words, as if they were both inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity and Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: So that to effectuate this their Work of Malice againſt us, they have not been aſhamed to take the Help, and commend the Labours of ſome invidious <hi>Socinians</hi> againſt us. So do <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> agree to crucifie Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But our Practice, known to thee by good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to be more conſiſtent with Chriſtianity and Civil Society, and the Peace and Welfare of this Iſland, than that of thoſe that thus accuſe us, doth ſufficiently guard us againſt this Calumny; that we may indeed appeal to the Teſtimony of thy Conſcience, as a Witneſs for us in the face of the Nations.</p>
            <p>Theſe things moved me to preſent the World with a Brief, but True Account of this People's Principles, in ſome ſhort <hi>Theological Propoſitions</hi>; which, according to the Will of God, proving ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, beyond my expectation, to the ſatisfaction of ſeveral, and to the moving in many a deſire of
<pb facs="unknown:003129_0005_0FF004008309CD30"/>
being farther informed concerning us, as being every where evil ſpoken of, and likewiſe meeting with publick Oppoſition by ſome, as ſuch will always do, ſo long as the <hi>Devil rules in the Children of Diſobedience</hi>; I was thereby further ingaged, in the Liberty of the Lord, to preſent to the World this <hi>Apology</hi> of the Truth held by thoſe People: Which, becauſe of thy Intereſt in them, and theirs in thee, as having firſt appeared, and moſtly increaſed in theſe Nations under thy Rule, I make bold to Preſent unto thee.</p>
            <p>Thou knoweſt, and haſt Experienced, <hi>their Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs towards their God, their Patience in Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, their Peaceableneſs towards the King, their Honeſty, Plainneſs and Integrity in their faithful Warnings and Teſtimonies to thee</hi>; and if thou wilt allow thy ſelf ſo much time as to read this, thou may'ſt find <hi>how Conſonant their Principles are both to Scripture, Truth, and Right Reaſon.</hi> The Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of their Behaviour, the Generality of their Condition, as being Poor Men and Illiterate; the Manner of their Porcedure, being without the Wiſdom and Policy of this World, hath made many conclude them Fools and Mad-Men; and neglect them, as not being capable of Reaſon. But tho' it be to them as their Crown, thus to be eſteemed of the Wiſe, and Great and Learned of this World, and though they rejoyce to be accounted Fools for Chriſt's ſake; yet of late, ſome, even ſuch, who in the World's account are eſteemed both Wiſe and Learned, begin to judge otherwiſe of them, and find, that they hold forth things very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both to Scriptue, Reaſon, and true Learning.</p>
            <p>As it is inconſiſtent with the Truth I bear, ſo it is far from me to uſe this Epiſtle as an Engine
<pb facs="unknown:003129_0006_0FF00402F7470810"/>
to <hi>flatter</hi> thee, the uſual deſign of ſuch Works; and therefore I can neither Dedicate it to thee, nor crave thy Patronage, as if thereby I might have more Confidence to preſent it to the World, or be more hopeful of its ſucceſs. To God alone I owe what I have, and that more immediately in Matters Spiritual; and therefore to him alone, and to the Service of his Truth, I dedicate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Work he brings forth in me: To whom only the Praiſe and Honour appertains, whoſe Truth needs not the Patronage of Worldly Princes; his Arm and Power being that alone, by which it is Propagated, Eſtabliſhed and Confirmed. But I found it upon my Spirit, to take occaſion to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this Book unto thee; that as thou haſt been often warned by ſeveral of that People, who are Inhahitants of <hi>England</hi>; ſo thou may'ſt not want a ſeaſonable Advertiſement, from a Member of thy Ancient Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and that thou may'ſt know (which I hope thou ſhalt have no reaſon to be troubled at) that God is raiſing up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing that people in that Nation. And the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall alſo hereby know, that the <hi>Truth</hi> we profeſs, is not a Work of Darkneſs, nor propagated by ſtealth; and that we are not aſhamed of the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe we know it to be the <hi>Power of God to Salvation</hi>; and that we are no ways ſo inconſiſtent with Government, nor ſuch Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Peace, as our Enemies, by traducing us, have ſought to make the World believe we are: For which, to thee I dare appeal, as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Peaceableneſs and Chriſtian Patience.</p>
            <p>Generations to come ſhall not more admire that ſingular ſtep of Divine Providence, in Reſtoring thee to thy Throne, without outward Bloodſhed, than they ſhall admire the Increaſe and Progreſs
<pb facs="unknown:003129_0006_0FF00402F7470810"/>
of this <hi>Truth,</hi> without all outward Help, and againſt ſo great Oppoſition; which ſhall be none of the leaſt things rendring thy <hi>Memory</hi> Remarkable.</p>
            <p>God hath done great things for thee, he hath ſufficiently ſhewn thee, That it is <hi>by Him Princes rule,</hi> and that <hi>He can pull down and ſet up at his pleaſure.</hi> He hath often faithfully warned thee by his Servants, ſince he Reſtored thee to thy <hi>Royal Dignity,</hi> that thy Heart might not wax wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton againſt him, to forget his Mercies and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences towards thee; whereby he might permit thee to be ſoothed up, and lulled aſleep in thy Sins, by the Flattering of <hi>Court-Paraſites,</hi> who by their fawning, are the <hi>Ruine</hi> of many <hi>Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no King in the World, who can ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally teſtifie of God's Providence and Goodneſs; neither is there any, who rules ſo many free People, ſo many true Chriſtians: Which thing renders thy Government more Honourable, thy Self more Conſiderable, than the Acceſſion of many Nations, filled with ſlaviſh and ſuperſtitious Souls.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt taſted of Proſperity and Adverſity; thou know'ſt what it is to be Baniſhed thy Native Country, to be Over ruled, as well as to Rule, and ſit upon the Throne; and being <hi>oppreſſed,</hi> thou haſt reaſon to know how <hi>hateful</hi> the <hi>Oppreſſor</hi> is, both to God and Man: If after all theſe Warnings and Advertiſements, thou doſt not turn unto the Lord with all thy Heart; but forget him, who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered thee in thy diſtreſs, and give up thy Self to follow Luſt and Vanity; ſurely great will be thy Condemnation.</p>

               <hi>R. B.</hi> Unto the Friendly Reader wiſheth Salvation.</head>
            <p>FOraſmuch as that, which above all things I propoſe to my ſelf, is to Declare and Defend the <hi>Truth;</hi> for the Service whereof I have given up and devoted myſelf, and all that is mine: Therefore there is nothing which for its ſake (by the help and aſſiſtance of God) I may not attempt. And in this Confidence, I did ſome time ago publiſh certain Propoſitions of Divinity, comprehending briefly the chief Principles and Doctrines of <hi>Truth;</hi> which, appearing not unprofitable to ſome, and being, beyond my Expectation, well received both by Foreigners, tho' diſſenting from us, (albeit alſo oppoſed by ſome Envious Ones) did ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, as in ſome part to remove that falſe and monſtrous Opinion, which Lying Fame, and the Malice of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, had implanted in the Minds of ſome, concerning us and our Doctrines. In this reſpect it ſeem'd to me not fit to ſpare my Pains and Labour.</p>
            <p>Therefore, being acted by the ſame meaſure of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, and the like deſign of Propagating the Truth, by which I publiſhed the Propoſitions, I judg'd it meet to explain them ſomewhat more largely at this time, and defend them by certain Arguments.</p>
            <p>Perhaps my Method of Writing may ſeem not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but even contrary, to that which is commonly uſed by the Men called <hi>Divines,</hi> with which I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: For that I confeſs my ſelf to be not only no Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator and Admirer of the <hi>School Men,</hi> but an Oppoſer and Deſpiſer of them, as ſuch; by whoſe Labour I judge the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is ſo far from being bettered, that it is rather deſtroyed. Neither have I ſought to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate this my Work to itching Ears, who deſire rather to comprehend in their Heads the ſublime Notions of Truth, than to imbrace it in their Hearts: For what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten comes more from my Heart than from my Head; what I have heard with the Ears of my Soul, and ſeen with my
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003129_0008_0FF004079BA6EF08"/>
inward Eyes, and my Hands have handled of the <hi>Word of Life;</hi> and what hath been inwardly manifeſted to me of the things of God, that do I declare; not ſo much minding the Eloquence and Excellency of Speech, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to demonſtrate the Efficacy &amp; Operation of Truth; and if I err ſometimes in the former, it is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for I act not here the <hi>Grammarian,</hi> or the <hi>Orator,</hi> but the <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and therefore in this I have followed the certain Rule of the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to make an end; What I have written, is written not to feed the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or rather <hi>vain Pride of this World,</hi> but to ſtarve and oppoſe it, as the little Preface prefix'd to the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> doth ſhew; which, with the Title of them, is as followeth.</p>

But if we ſhall make a right De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> according to the Scripture, <hi>videlicet,</hi> That <hi>he is one that hath the Spirit, and is led by it:</hi> How many <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yea, and of thoſe great <hi>Maſters and Doctors of Chriſtianity,</hi> ſo accounted, ſhall we juſtly diveſt of that noble Title?</p>
               <p>If then ſuch as have all the other Means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and are ſufficiently learned therein, whether it be the Letter of the Scripture, the Traditions of Churches, the Works of Creation and Providence, whence they are able to deduce ſtrong and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Arguments (which may be true in themſelves) are not yet to be eſteemed <hi>Christians,</hi> according to the certain and infallible Definition above mentioned: And if the inward and immediate Revelation of God's Spirit in the Heart, in ſuch as have been altogether ignorant of ſome, and but very little skilled in others, of theſe Means of attaining Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hath brought them to Salvation;<note place="margin">By Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</note> then it will neceſſarily and evidently follow, that Inward and Immediate Revelation is the only ſure and certain Way to attain the true and ſaving Knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>But the firſt is true: Therefore the laſt.</p>
               <p>Now as this Argument doth very ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for this Way of Knowledge, and againſt ſuch as deny it; ſo herein it is the more conſiderable, becauſe the Propoſitions, from which it is deduced,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003129_0020_0FF0042498AEE0D0"/>
are ſo clear, that our very Adverſaries cannot deny them. For, as to the firſt, it is acknowledged, that many Learned Men may be, and have been, damned. And as to the ſecond, who will deny but many illiterate Men may be, and are, ſaved? Not dare any affirm, that none come to the Knowledge of God and Salvation by the inward Revelation of the Spirit, without theſe other outward Means; unleſs they be alſo ſo bold as to exclude <hi>Abel, Seth, Noah, Abraham,</hi>

               <p n="4">§. IV. I would however not be underſtood, as if hereby I excluded thoſe other Means of Knowledge, from any uſe or ſervice to Man; it is far from me ſo to judge, as in the next Propoſition, concerning the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſhall more plainly appear. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not, what may be profitable or helpful but what is abſolutely neceſſary.

               <p>The Sum then of what is ſaid, amounts to this, That where the true Inward Knowledge of God is, through the Revelation of his Spirit, there is all; neither is there an abſolute neceſſity of any other. But where the beſt, higheſt, and moſt profound Knowledge is, without this there is nothing, as to the obtaining the great End of Salvation.

               <p>Of each of theſe I ſhall ſpeak a little particularly, and then proceed to the latter Part.</p>
               <p n="5">§. V. As to the firſt,<note place="margin">Aſſert. <hi>I.</hi> Proved.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. That there is no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the</hi> Father <hi>but by the</hi> Son, it will not need much Probation, being founded upon the Plain Words of Scripture, and is therefore a fit <hi>Medium</hi> to draw the reſt of our Aſſertions from.</p>
               <p>For the infinite and moſt wiſe God, who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, Root &amp; Spring of all Operation, hath wrought all things by his Eternal Word and Son.<note place="margin">John 1.1, 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>This is that</hi> WORD, <hi>that was in the beginning with God, and was God, by whom all things were made, and without whom was not any thing made that was made.</hi> This is that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by whom God created all things, by whom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and for whom, all things were created, that are in Heaven and in Earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers,</hi> Col. 1.16. Who therefore is called, <hi>The firſt born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Col. 1.15. As then, that infinite and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Fountain of Life and Motion, operateth in the Creatures, by his own Eternal Word and Power; ſo no Creature has acceſs again unto him, but in and by the Son, according to his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Words, <hi>No man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him,</hi> Matth. 11.27. Luke 10.22. And again, he himſelf ſaith, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: No man cometh unto the Father but by me,</hi> John 14.6.</p>
               <p>Hence he is fitly called <hi>The Mediator betwixt God and Man:</hi> For having been with God from all Eternity, being himſelf God, and alſo in time par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Nature of Man; through him is the Goodneſs and Love of God convey'd to Mankind, and by him again Man receiveth and partaketh of theſe Mercies.</p>
               <p>Hence is eaſily deduced the Probation of this firſt Aſſertion, thus:</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:003129_0021_0FF0042716DDC668"/>
               <p>If no Man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him; then there is no knowledge of the Father, but by the Son.</p>
               <p>But, no Man knoweth the Father but the Son.</p>
               <p>Therefore, there is no knowledge of the Father but by the Son.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of the antecedent are the plain words of Scripture: The conſequence thereof is undeniable; except one would ſay, that he hath the knowledge of the Father, while yet he knows him not; which were an abſurd Repugnance.</p>
               <p>Again, If the Son be the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and that no Man cometh unto the Father but by him; then there is no knowledge of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by the Son.</p>
               <p>But the firſt is true: Therefore the laſt.</p>
               <p>The antecedent are the very Scripture words. The conſequence is very evident: For how can any know a thing, who uſeth not the way, without which it is not knowable? But it is already proved, that there is no other way, but by the Son; ſo that whoſo uſes not that way, cannot know him, neither come unto him.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aſſert.</hi> II.</note>§. VI. Having then laid down this firſt Principle, I come to the ſecond,<note place="margin">Proved.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. That there is no Knowledge of the Son but by the Spirit</hi>; or, <hi>That the Revelation of the Son of God, is by the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where it is to be noted, that I always ſpeak of the ſaving, certain and neceſſary Knowledge of God, which that it cannot be acquired otherways than by the Spirit, doth alſo appear from many clear Scriptures. For Jeſus Chriſt, in and by whom the Father is revealed, doth alſo reveal himſelf to his Diſciples and Friends, in and by his Spirit; as his Manifeſtation was ſometimes outward, when he teſtified and witneſſed for the Truth in this World, and approved himſelf faithful throughout: So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now withdrawn, as to the outward Man, he doth teach and inſtruct Mankind inwardly, by his
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003129_0021_0FF0042716DDC668"/>
own Spirit; <hi>He ſtandeth at the door and knocketh, and whoſo beareth his Voice and openeth, he comes in</hi> to ſuch, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. Of this Revelation of Chriſt in him, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. in which he placeth the Excellency of his Miniſtry, and the Certainty of his Calling. And the Promiſe of Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Lo, I am with you to the end of the World,</hi> confirmeth the ſame thing; for this is an inward Preſence and Spiritual, as all acknowledge: But what relates hereto will again occur. I ſhall deduce the Proof of this Propoſition from two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt places of Scripture: The firſt is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proof</hi> 1.</note> 12. <hi>What Man knoweth the things of a Man ſave the Spirit of Man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Things of <hi>God</hi> are known by the Spirit of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that we might know the things which are freely given us of God.</hi> The Apoſtle in the verſes before, ſpeaking of the wonderful things which are prepared for the Saints, after he hath declared, that <hi>the Natural Man cannot reach them,</hi> adds, that <hi>They are revealed by the Spirit of God,</hi> verſ. 9, 10. giving this reaſon, <hi>For the Spirit ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, even the deep things of God.</hi> And then he bringeth in the compariſon, in the verſes above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned very apt, and anſwerable to our Purpoſe and Doctrine, that <hi>as the things of a Man are only known by the Spirit of Man; ſo the things of God are only known by the Spirit of God:</hi> That is, that as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below the Spirit of Man (as the Spirit of Brutes, or any other Creatures) can properly reach unto, or comprehend the things of a Man, as being of a nobler and higher Nature; ſo neither can the Spirit of Man, or the Natural Man, as the Apoſtle in the 14th Verſe ſubſumes, receive nor diſcern the things of God, or the things that are Spiritual, as being alſo of a higher Nature; which the Apoſtle himſelf gives for the reaſon, ſaying, <hi>Neither can he know them becauſe they are Spiritually diſcerned.</hi> So
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003129_0022_0FF004290A8705C8"/>
that, the Apoſtles words being reduced to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, do very well prove the matter under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, thus:</p>
               <p>If that which appertaineth properly to Man, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſcerned by any lower or baſer Principle, than the Spirit of Man; then cannot theſe things, that properly relate unto God and Chriſt, be known or diſcerned by any lower or baſer thing, than the Spirit of God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But the Firſt is true: Therefore alſo the Second.</p>
               <p>The whole ſtrength of the Argument is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Apoſtle's words before-mentioned; which therefore being granted, I ſhall proceed to deduce a ſecond Argument, thus:</p>
               <p>That which is Spiritual, can only be known and diſcerned by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>But the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, and the true and ſaving Knowledge of him, is Spiritual:</p>
               <p>Therefore the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, and the true and ſaving Knowledge of him, can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be known and diſcerned by the Spirit of God.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003129_0022_0FF004290A8705C8"/>
ought to direct the Mind, and actuate it; in ſuch things they are no better than the counterfeit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of things in a Comedy; neither can it be more truly and properly called a real and true Knowledge of God and Chriſt, than the actings of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> &amp;c. if now Tranſacted upon a Stage, might be called truly and really their doings, or the Perſons repreſenting them might be ſaid truly and really to have conquered <hi>Aſia,</hi> and overcome <hi>Pompey,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Knowledge then of Chriſt, which is not by the Revelation of his own Spirit in the Heart, is no more properly the Knowledge of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Like the pratling of a <hi>Parrot.</hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this Scripture, I ſhall further add this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:</p>
               <p>If no Man can ſay <hi>Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> then no Man can know <hi>Jeſus to be the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

and certain Belief of the Mind, whereby it <hi>reſteth,</hi> and in a ſenſe <hi>poſſeſſeth</hi> the Subſtance of ſome things hoped for, through its Confidence in the Promiſe of God: And thus the Soul hath a moſt firm Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by its Faith, of things not yet ſeen nor come to paſs. The Object of this Faith, is the <hi>Promiſe, Word,</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony of God,</hi> ſpeaking in the Mind. Hence it hath been generally affirmed, That the Object of Faith is <hi>Deus Loquens,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>God Speaking,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Object of Faith, <hi>Deus Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens.</hi>
                  </note> &amp;c. Which alſo is manifeſt from all thoſe Examples, deduced by the Apoſtle throughout that whole Chapter, whoſe Faith was founded neither upon any outward Teſtimony, nor upon the Voice or Writing of Man, but upon the Revelation of God's Will, manifeſt unto them, and in them; as in the Example of <hi>Noah</hi> ver. 7. thus, <hi>By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God, of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his Houſe; by the which he condemned the World, and became Heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi> What was here the Object of <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Noah<hi>'s Faith.</hi>
                  </note> but God ſpeaking unto him? He had not the Writings nor Propheſyings of any going before, nor yet the Concurrence of any Church or People, to ſtrengthen him; and yet his Faith in the Word, by which he contradicted the whole World, ſaved him and his Houſe. Of which alſo <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſet forth as a ſingular Example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore called the Father of the Faithful,<note place="margin">Abraham<hi>'s Faith.</hi>
                  </note> who is ſaid <hi>againſt hope to have believed in hope</hi>; in that he not only willingly forſook his Father's Country not knowing whither he went, in that he believed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the coming of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though contrary to natural probability; but above all, in that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed not to offer him up, not doubting but God was able to raiſe him from the Dead; of whom it is ſaid, That <hi>in Iſaac ſhall thy Seed be called.</hi> And laſt of all, In that he reſted in the Promiſe, that his Seed ſhould Poſſeſs the Land, wherein himſelf was but a Pilgrim, and which to them was not to be

               <p>But becauſe, in this part of the Propoſition, we made alſo mention of external Voices, Appearances and Dreams in the Alternative, I think alſo fit to ſpeak hereof, what in that reſpect, may be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to wit,</p>

                  </label> It is not denied, but God made uſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Angels, who in the appearance of Men, ſpake outwardly to the Saints of old,<note place="margin">The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the appearance of Men to the <hi>Saints</hi> of old.</note> and that he did alſo reveal ſome things to them in Dreams and Viſions; none of which we will affirm to be ceaſed. ſo as to limit the Power and Liberty of God, in manifeſting himſelf towards his Childern.

               <p>Next again, We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt that which in it ſelf is ſubject to doubt and deluſion, and therefore is received for and becauſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that which is not ſubject to any doubt, but is received ſimply for, and becauſe of it felt, as being <hi>Prima Veritas,</hi> the <hi>very First</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> Truth.

Nay, certainly, we know, and they were not ignorant, that the Devil can form a ſound of words, and convey it to the outward Ear; that he can eaſily deceive the outward ſenſes, by making things to appear, that are not.

We muſt not think his Faith then was built upon his outward Senſes; but proceeded from the ſecret Perſwaſion of God's Spirit in his Heart. This then muſt needs be acknowledged to be ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally and principally the object of the Saints Faith; without which there is no true and certain Faith, and by which many times Faith is begotten and ſtrengthened, without any of theſe outward or viſible Helps; as we may obſerve in many Paſſages of the Holy Scripture, where it is only mentioned, <hi>And God ſaid,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>Rom</hi> 8.16. And ſeeing the Spirit of God is within us, and not without us only, it ſpeaks to our ſpiritual, and not to our bodily Ear.

their Arguments, and we may further conſider of them.</p>
               <p>From all then which is above declared, I ſhall deduce, an Argument to conclude the Probation of this Aſſertion, thus:</p>
               <p>That which any one firmly believes, as the ground and foundation of his Hope in God, and Life Eternal, is the formal Object of his Faith.</p>
               <p>But the inward and immediate Revelation of God's Spirit, ſpeaking in and unto the Saints, was by them believed, as the ground and foundation of their Hope in God, and Life Eternal.</p>
               <p>Therefore theſe inward an immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were the formal Object of their Faith.</p>
               <p n="9">§. IX.

               <p>There is nevertheleſs a very firm Argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Truth of this Aſſertion, included in the Propoſition it ſelf, to wit, <hi>That the Object of the Saints Faith is the ſame in all Ages tho' held forth under divers Adminiſtrations.</hi> Which I ſhall reduce to an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and prove thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Where the Faith is one, the Object of the Faith is one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Faith is one: Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That the Faith is one, is the expreſs words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. who placeth the <hi>one Faith</hi> with the <hi>one God</hi>; importing no leſs than, that to affirm <hi>two Faiths,</hi> is as abſurd as to affirm <hi>two Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, if the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Ancients were not one and the ſame with ours <hi>i. e.</hi> agreeing in <hi>Substance</hi> therewith, and receiving the ſame definition,<note place="margin">The Faith of the Saints of old, the ſame with ours.</note> it had been impertinent for the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. to have illuſtrated the definition of our Faith, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of that of the Ancients, or to go about to move us by the Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if <hi>Abraham</hi>'s

Faith were different in nature from ours. Nor doth hence any Difference ariſe, becauſe they believed in Chriſt, with reſpect to his Appearance outwardly as future; and we, as already appeared: For, neither did they then ſo believe in him to come, as not to feel him preſent with them, and witneſs him near: ſeeing the Apoſtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now wherein are they imitable, but becauſe they believed in God? And what was the Object of their Faith, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and immediate Revelation, as we have before proved? Their Example can be no Ways applicable to us, except we believe in God, as they did; that is, by the ſame Object. The Apoſtle clears this yet further by his own Example, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. where he ſaith, <hi>So ſoon as Chriſt was revealed in him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted not with Fleſh and Blood, but forthwith believed and obeyed.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.8. where he exhorteth the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to follow the Faith of the Elders, adds this Reaſon, <hi>Conſidering the End of their Converſation, Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame to day, yeſterday, and for ever:</hi> Hereby notably inſinuating, that in the Object there is no alteration.</p>

               <p>But further, If the Object of Faith were not one and the ſame, both to us and to them, then it would follow, that we were to know God ſome other way, than by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>But this were abſurd: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

Hereunto have all true Chriſtians, in all Ages, attributed their Strength and Life. It is by this Spirt, that they avouch themſelves to have been converted to God, to have been redeemed from the World, to have been ſtrengthened in their Weakneſs, comforted in their Afflictions, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Temptations, imboldened in their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and triumphed in the midſt of all their Perſecutions, Yea, The Writings of all true Chriſtians are full of the great and notable Things,<note place="margin">The great and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Acts that have been and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Spirit</hi> in all Ages.</note> which they all affirm themſelves to have done, by the Power, and Vertue, and Efficacy of this Spirit of God working in them. <hi>It is the</hi> Spirit <hi>that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi> John 6.63.

               <p>Again: No Man is redeemed from the Carnal Mind, which is at Enmity with God, which is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither can be: No Man is yet in the Spirit, but in the Fleſh, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God, except he in whom the Spirit of God dwells.</p>
               <p>But every true Chriſtian is (in meaſure) redeemed from the Carnal Mind, is gathered out of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and can be ſubject to the Law of God; is out of the Fleſh, and in the Spirit, the Spirit of God dwelling in him.</p>

The firſt is only by us aſſerted, the latter may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion. The queſtion is not, who are, or are not ſo led? But whether all ought not, or may not be ſo led?</p>
               <p>Seeing then, we have already proved,<note place="margin">The Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Spirit's Guidance proved.</note> that Chriſt hath promiſed his Spirit to lead his Children, and that every one of them both ought, and may be led by it; If any depart from this certain Guide, in Deeds, and yet in Words pretend to be led by it into things, that are not good, it will not from thence follow, that the true guidance of the Spirit is uncertain, or ought not to be followed, no more than it will follow, that the Sun ſheweth not light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Blind Man, or one who wilfully ſhuts his Eyes, falls into a Ditch at Noon day for want of Light; or that no Words are ſpoken, becauſe a Deaf Man hears them not: or that a Garden full of fragrant Flowers has no ſweet ſmell, becauſe he

               <p>All theſe Miſtakes therefore are to be aſcribed to the Weakneſs or Wickedneſs of Men, and not to that Holy Spirit.

               <p>Therefore the Teſtimony of the <hi>true Spirit of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> was uncertain, and dangerous to be followed.</p>
               <p>Becauſe there were <hi>ſeducing ſpirits</hi> crept into the Church of old:</p>
               <p>Therefore it was not good, or uncertain, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Anointing</hi> which taught all things, and is Truth, and no Lye.</p>

               <p>Many have been deceived, and erred grievouſly, in truſting to Tradition.</p>
               <p>Therefore we ought to reject all Traditions, yea, even thoſe by which we affirm the contrary, and as we think prove the Truth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Scripture, the ſame difficulty occurreth: The <hi>Lutherans</hi> affirm they believe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, by the Scripture, which the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> deny; as that which (they ſay) according to the ſame Scripture, is a groſs Error.

affirm themſelves to be ruled by the Scripture and Reaſon, in the matter. Should I argue thus then to the <hi>Calviniſts</hi>?</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> groſly err, by following the Scripture:</p>

                  </note>I might ſay much of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> whoſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Actions againſt their Magiſtrates, not profeſſing the <hi>Lutheran Profeſſion,</hi> are teſtified of by ſeveral Hiſtorians worthy of Credit. Among others, I ſhall propoſe only one Example to the Readers Conſideration, which fell out at <hi>Berlin,</hi> in the Year, 1615.
<q>Where the ſeditious Multitude of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Citizens, being ſtirred up by the daily Clamours of their Preachers, did not only violently take up the Houſes of the Reformed
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003129_0037_0FF0044B46318E58"/>
Teachers, overturn their Libraries, and ſpoil their Furniture; but alſo with reproachful Words, yea, and with Stones, aſſaulted the Marqueſs of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> the Elector's Brother, while he ſought by ſmooth Words to quiet the Fury of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: They killed ten of his Guard, ſcarcely ſparing himſelf; who at laſt, by Flight, eſcaped out of their Hands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All which ſufficiently declares, that the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Magiſtrate doth not alter their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but only their Method of Procedure. So that for my own part, I ſee no Difference betwixt the Actings of thoſe of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and theſe others, (whereof the one pretended to be led by the Spirit, the other by Tradition, Scripture and Reaſon) ſave this; that the former were raſh, heady and fooliſh, in their Proceedings, and therefore were ſooner brought to nothing, and ſo into Contempt and Deriſion: But the other being more Politick and Wiſe in their Generation, held it out longer, and ſo have authorized their Wickedneſs more, with ſeeming Authority of Law and Reaſon. But both their Actings being equally Evil, the Difference ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be only like that which is betwixt a ſimple filly Thief, that is eaſily catched, and hanged without any more ado; and a Company of reſolute bold Robbers, who being better guarded, tho' their Offence be nothing leſs, yet by Violence do (to evite the Danger) force their Maſters to give them better Terms.</p>
               <p>From all which then it evidently follows, that they argue very ill, that deſpiſe and reject any Principle, becauſe Men, pretending to be led by it, do evil; in caſe it be not the natural and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential Tendency of that Principle, to lead unto thoſe Things that are evil.</p>
               <p>Again, It doth follow from what is above aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that if the Spirit be to be rejected upon this Account, all thoſe other Principles ought on the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:003129_0038_0FF0044CE4B3D020"/>
ſame account to be rejected. And for my part, as I have never a whit the lower eſteem of the Bleſſed Teſtimony of the Holy Scriptures; nor do the leſs reſpect any ſolid Tradition, that is anſwerable and according to Truth; neither at all deſpiſe Reaſon, that noble and excellent Faculty of the Mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wicked Men have abuſed the Name of them,<note place="margin">Let none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng Spirit of God, becauſe of falſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to it.</note> to cover their Wickedneſs, and deceive the Simple: So I would not have any reject or diffide the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of that Unerring Spirit, which God hath given his Children, as that which can alone guide them into all Truth, becauſe ſome have falſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to it.</p>
               <p n="15">§. XV. And becauſe the Spirit of God is the Fountain of all Truth and found Reaſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have well ſaid, That <hi>it cannot contradict neither the Testimony of the Scripture, nor right Reaſon: Yet</hi> (as the Propoſition it ſelf concludeth, to whoſe laſt part I now come) <hi>it will not from thence follow, that theſe Divine Revelations are to be ſubjected to the Examination either of the outward Testimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of the humane or natural Reaſon of Man, as to a more noble and certain Rule and Touch ſtone; for the Divine Revelation, and Inward Illumination, is that which it evident by it ſelf, forcing the well diſpoſed Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and irreſiſtibly moving it to aſſent, by its own Evidence and Clearneſs, even as the common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of natural Truths do bow the Mind to a natural Aſſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that denies this part of the Propoſition, muſt needs affirm, that the Spirit of God neither can nor ever hath manifeſted it ſelf to Man, without the Scripture, or a diſtinct diſcuſſion of Reaſon; or that the Efficacy of this Supernatural Principle, working upon the Souls of Men, is leſs evident than Natural Principles in their common Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; both which are falſe.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> Through all the Scriptures we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That the Manifeſtation and Revelation of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003129_0038_0FF0044CE4B3D020"/>
God by his Spirit, to the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apoſtles, was <hi>Immediate</hi> and <hi>Objective,</hi> as is above proved; which they did not examine by any other Principle, but their own Evidence and Clearneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Self-Evidence of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </note> To ſay that the Spirit of God has leſs Evidence upon the Mind of Man, than Natural Principles have, is to have too mean and too low Thoughts of it. How comes <hi>David</hi> to invite us, to <hi>taſte, and ſee that God is good,</hi> if this cannot be felt and taſted? This were enough to overturn the Faith and Aſſurance of all the Saints, both now and of old. How came <hi>Paul</hi> to be perſwaded, that <hi>nothing could ſeparate him from the Love of God,</hi> but by that Evidence and Clearneſs, which the Spirit of God gave him? The Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> who knew well wherein the Certainty of Faith conſiſted, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it no ways abſurd, without further Argument, to aſcribe his Knowledge and Aſſurance, and that of all the Saints hereunto, in theſe Words, <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his</hi> Spirit, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.13. And again, 5, 6. It's <hi>the</hi> Spirit <hi>that beareth witneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the</hi> Spirit is Truth.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the Reaſon brought by him, <hi>Becauſe the Spirit is Truth:</hi> Of whoſe Certainty and Infallibility I have heretofore ſpoken. We then truſt to and confide in this Spirit, becauſe we know, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believe, that it can only lead us aright, and never miſ-lead us; and from this certain Confidence it is that we affirm,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spirit</hi> contradicts not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> That no Revelation coming from it, can ever contradict the Scriptures Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, nor right Reaſon: Not as making this a more certain Rule to our ſelves, but as condeſcending to ſuch, who not diſcerning the Revelations of the Spirit, as they proceed purely from God, will try them by theſe <hi>Mediums.</hi> Yet thoſe that have their Spiritual Senſes, and can favour the things of the Spirit, as it were <hi>in prima inſtantia,</hi> i. e. at the firſt Bluſh, can diſcern them without, or before they

apply them either to Scripture or Reaſon: Juſt as a good <hi>Astronomer</hi> can calculate an Eclipſe infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly,<note place="margin">Natural Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy</hi> and <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry.</hi>
                  </note> by which he can conclude (if the Order of Nature continue, and ſome ſtrange and unnatural Revolution intervene not) there will be an Eclipſe of the Sun or Moon ſuch a Day, and ſuch an Hour; yet can he not perſwade an ignorant Ruſtick of this, until he viſibly ſee it. So alſo a <hi>Mathematician</hi> can infallibly know, by the Rules of Art, that the three Angles of a right Triangle, are equal to two right Angles; yea, can know them more certainly, than any Man by Meaſure. And ſome <hi>Geometrical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations</hi> are by all acknowledged to be infallible, which can be ſcarcely diſcerned or proved by the Senſes; yet if a <hi>Geometer</hi> be at the Pains to certify ſome ignorant Man concerning the Certainty of his Art, by condeſcending to meaſure it, and make it obvious to his Senſes, it will not thence follow, that that Meaſuring is ſo certain as the Demonſtration it ſelf; or that the Demonſtration would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain without it.</p>
               <p n="16">§. XVI. But to make an End, I ſhall add one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove, That this inward, Immediate, Objective Revelation, which we have pleaded for all along, is the only, ſure, certain, and unmoveable Foundation of all <hi>Christian Faith:</hi> Which Argument, when well weighed, I hope will have Weight with all Sorts of Chriſtians; and it is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Immediate Revelation of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Foundation</note>That which all Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> of what Kind ſoever, are forced ultimately to recur unto, when preſſed to the laſt, That for and becauſe of which all other Foundations are recommended, and accounted worthy to be believed, and without which they are granted to be of no Weight at all, muſt needs be the only moſt true, certain, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Foundation of all Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>But Inward, immediate, Objective Revelation, by the Spirit, is that which all Profeſſors of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> of what kind ſoever, are forced ultimately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur unto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition is ſo evident, that it will not be denied; The Aſſumption ſhall be proved by Parts.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Firſt</hi>; As to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Papiſts</hi> Foundation their Church and Tradition, <hi>Why?</hi>
                  </note> they place their Foundation in the Judgment of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> If we preſs them to ſay, Why they believe as the Church doth; Their Anſwer is, <hi>Becauſe the Church is always led by the</hi> Infallible Spirit. So here the Leading of the Spirit, is the utmoſt Foundation. Again, if we ask them, Why we ought to truſt <hi>Tradition</hi>? They anſwer, <hi>Becauſe theſe Traditions were delivered us by the Doctors and Fathers of the Church; which Doctors and Fathers, by the Revelation of the</hi> Holy Ghoſt, <hi>commanded the Church to obſerve them.</hi> Here again all ends in the Revelation of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures their Ground &amp; Foundation <hi>Why?</hi>
                  </note> both which acknowledge the Scriptures to be the Foundation and Rule of their Faith; the one is ſubjectively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the Spirit of God to uſe them; the other, as managing them with and by their own Reaſon. Ask both, or either of them, Why they truſt in the Scriptures, and take them to be their Rule? Their Anſwer is, <hi>Becauſe we have in them the Mind of God delivered unto us, by thoſe, to whom theſe Things were inwardly, immediately, and objectively revealed by the</hi> Spirit <hi>of God</hi>; and not becauſe this or that Man wrote them, but becauſe the Spirit of God dictated them.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange then,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by Name, and not by Nature, hold Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture.</note> that Men ſhould render that ſo uncertain and dangerous to follow, upon which alone the certain Ground and Foundation of their own Faith is built; or that they ſhould ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out from that Holy Fellowſhip with God, which is only enjoyed in the Spirit, in which we are commanded both to walk and live.</p>
               <p>If any, reading theſe Things, find themſelves mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by the Strength of theſe Scripture Arguments,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003129_0040_0FEFD7304E8BF020"/>
to aſſent, and believe ſuch Revelations necceſſary; and yet find themſelves ſtrangers to them (which, as I obſerved in the beginning, is the cauſe that this is ſo much gain-ſaid and contradicted) Let them know, that it is not becauſe it is ceaſed to become the Priviledge of every true Chriſtian, that they do not feel it; but rather becauſe they are not ſo much Chriſtians by Nature, as by Name: And let ſuch know, that the ſecret <hi>Light,</hi> which ſhines in the Heart, and reproves Unrighteouſneſs, is the ſmall Beginning of the Revelation of God's Spirit, which was firſt ſent into the World to reprove it of Sin, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. And as, by forſaking Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou com'ſt to be acquainted with that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Voice in thy Heart, thou ſhalt feel, as the Old Man, or the Natural Man, that ſavoureth not the things of God's Kingdom, is put off, with his evil and corrupt Affections and Luſts; I ſay, thou ſhalt feel the New Man, or the Spiritual Birth and Babe raiſed, which hath its Spiritual Senſes, and can ſee, feel, taſte, handle, and ſmell the things of the Spirit; but till then, the knowledge of things Spiritual, is but as an Hiſtorical Faith. But as the deſcription of the Light of the Sun,<note place="margin">Who wants his Sight, ſees not the Light.</note> or of curious Colours, to a Blind Man, who, tho' of the largeſt capacity, cannot ſo well underſtand it, by the moſt acute and lively Deſcription, as a Child can by ſeeing them: So neither can the Natural Man, of the largeſt capacity, by the beſt words, even Scripture-words, ſo well underſtand the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as the leaſt and weakeſt Child who taſteth them, by having them Revealed <hi>inwardly</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively</hi> by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Wait then for this, in the ſmall Revelation of that pure Light, which firſt reveals things more known; and as thou becom'ſt fitted for it, thou ſhalt receive more and more, and by a Living Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience eaſily refute their Ignorance, who ask, How doſt thou know, that thou art acted by the

                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, becauſe they are only a Declaration of the Fountain, and not the Fountain it ſelf; therefore they are not to be eſteemed the principal Ground of all Truth and Knowledge, nor yet the adequate, primary Rule of Faith and Manners. Yet, becauſe they give a true and faithful Teſtimony of the firſt Foundation, they are and may be eſteemed a ſecondary Rule, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> from which they have all their Excellency &amp; Certainty: For, as by the inward Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> we do alone truly know them; ſo they teſtify, That the <hi>Spirit</hi> is that Guide, by which the Saints are led into all Truth; therefore,<note place="margin">John 16.13 Rom. 8.14</note> according to

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. I. THE former Part of this Propoſition, tho' it needs no Apology for it ſelf, yet it is a good Apology for us, and will help to ſweep away that, among many other Calumnies, wherewith we are often loaded, as if we were Vilifiers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers of the Scriptures; for in that which we affirm of them, it doth appear at what a high Rate we value them,<note place="margin">The Holy Scriptures the moſt Excellent Writings in the World.</note> accounting them (without all Deceit and Equivocation) the moſt excellent Writings in the World; to which not only no other Writings are to be preferr'd, but even in divers Reſpects not comparable thereto. For, as we freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that their Authority doth not depend upon the Approbation of Canons of any Church, or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; ſo neither can we ſubject them to the fallen, corrupt, and defiled Reaſon of Man: And therein, as we do freely agree with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> againſt the Error of the <hi>Romanists</hi>; ſo on the other Hand, we cannot go the Length of ſuch <hi>Protestants,</hi> as make their Authority to depend upon any Virtue or Power, that is in the Writings themſelves; but we deſire to aſcribe all to that Spirit, from which they proceeded.</p>
               <p>We confeſs indeed, there wants not a Majeſty in the Stile, a Coherence in the Parts, a good Scope in the Whole; but ſeeing theſe things are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the Natural, but only by the Spiritual Man, it is the Spirit of God that muſt give us that Belief of the Scriptures, which may ſatisfie our Conſciences. Therefore ſome of the chiefeſt
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:003129_0041_0FF0045182C2DD08"/>
among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> both in their particular Writings, and publick Confeſſions, are forced to acknowledge this.</p>

                     <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Teſtimony, That the Scriptures Certainty is from the Spirit.</note> that if there be a God in Heaven, theſe Writings have proceeded from him; yet he concludes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knowledge to be neceſſary: <hi>Inſtit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But if (ſaith he) we reſpect the Conſciences, that they be not daily moleſted with Doubts, and ſtick not at every Scruple, it is requiſite that this Perſwaſion which we ſpeak of, be taken higher than Humane Reaſon, Judgment, or Conjectures; to wit, from the ſecret Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Holy Spirit. <hi>And again,</hi> To thoſe that ask, that <hi>we prove unto them by Reaſon, that</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets were inſpired of God to ſpeak:</hi> I Anſwer, That the Teſtimony of the Holy Spirit is more excellent than all Reaſon.</q>
                  <hi>And again,</hi>
                  <q>Let this remain a firm Truth, That he only whom the Holy Ghoſt hath perſwaded, can repoſe himſelf on the Scripture with a true Certainty. <hi>And laſtly,</hi> This then is a Judgment, which cannot be begotten, but by a Heavenly Revelation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="2">§. II. Tho' then we do acknowledge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be a very Heavenly and Divine Writing, the Uſe of them to be very Comfortable and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Church of Chriſt, and that we alſo admire, and give Praiſe to the Lord, for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Providence, in preſerving theſe Writings ſo pure and uncorrupted, as we have them, through ſo long a Night of Apoſtacy, to be a Teſtimony of his Truth, againſt the Wickedneſs and Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, even of thoſe, whom he made inſtrumental in preſerving them; ſo that they have kept them to be a Witneſs againſt themſelves; yet we may not call them the principal Fountain of all Truth and Knowledge, nor yet the firſt adequate Rule of Faith and Manners, becauſe the principal Fountain of Truth, muſt be the Truth it ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> That,<note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not the principal Ground of Truth.</note> whoſe Certainty and Authority depends not upon another. When we doubt of the Streams of any River or Flood, we recur to the Fountain it ſelf, and having found it, there we deſiſt, we can go no further; becauſe there it ſprings out of the Bowels of the Earth, which are inſcrutable. Even ſo the Writings and Sayings of all Men, we muſt bring to the Word of God, I mean the Eternal Word, and if they agree hereunto, we ſtand there; for this Word always proceedeth, and doth eternally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God, in and by which the unſearchable Wiſdom of God, and unſearchable Counſel, and Will conceived in the Heart of God, is revealed unto us. That then the Scripture is not the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ground of Faith and Knowledge, as it appears by what is above ſpoken; ſo it is provided in the latter Part of the Propoſition, which being reduced to an Argument, runs thus:</p>
               <p>That, whereof the Certainty and Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon another, and which is received as Truth, becauſe of its proceeding from another, is not to be accounted the principal Ground and Origin of all Truth and Knowledge.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:003129_0043_0FF004562D6287C0"/>
               <p>But the Scriptures Authority and Certainty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Spirit, by which they were dictated; and the Reaſon why they were received as Truth, is, becauſe they proceeded from the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Therefore they are not the principal Ground of Truth.</p>
               <p>To confirm this Atgument, I added the School-Maxim, <hi>Propter quod unumquodque eſt tale, illud ipſum magis eſt tale.</hi> Which Maxim, tho' I confeſs it doth not hold univerſally, in all things; yet in this it both doth and will very well hold, as by applying it, as we have above intimated, will appear.</p>
               <p>The ſame Argument will hold, as to the other Branch of the Propoſition,<note place="margin">Neither are they the primary Rule of Faith and Manners.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is not the primary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners</hi>; thus:</p>
               <p>That which is not the Rule of my Faith in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Scriptures themſelves, is not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners:</p>
               <p>But the Scripture is not, nor can it be the Rule of that Faith, by which I believe them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That the Spirit is the Rule.</note>But as to this Part, we ſhall produce divers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments hereafter, as to what is affirmed, That the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>not the Scriptures, is the Rule,</hi> it is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled in the former Propoſition, the Sum where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall ſubſume in one Argument, thus:</p>
               <p>If by the Spirit we can only come to the true Knowledge of God: If by the Spirit we are to be led into all Truth, and ſo be taught of all Things; Then the Spirit, and not the Scriptures, is the Foundation and Ground of all Truth and Knowledge, and the primary Rule of Faith and Manners.</p>
               <p>But the firſt is true; Therefore alſo the laſt.</p>
               <p>Next, The very Nature of the Goſpel it ſelf declareth, That the Scriptures cannot be the <hi>only</hi> and <hi>chief Rule</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> elſe there ſhould be no Difference betwixt the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> As from the Nature of the New Covenant, by divers

               <p>But beſides theſe which are before mentioned,<note place="margin">Wherein the Law and Goſpel differ.</note> herein doth the Law and the Goſpel differ, in that the Law being outwardly written, brings under <hi>Condemnation,</hi> but hath not <hi>Life</hi> in it to <hi>ſave</hi>; whereas the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as it declares and makes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Evil, ſo it being an Inward Powerful Thing, gives Power alſo to obey, and deliver from the Evil. Hence it is called <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore ſuch as come to know it, and be acquainted with it, come to feel greater Power over their Iniquities, than all outward Laws or Rules can give them. Hence the Apoſtle concludes, Rom. 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you: For ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> This Grace then, that is <hi>Inward,</hi> and not an <hi>Outward</hi> Law, is to be the Rule of Chriſtians: Hereunto the Apoſtle commends the Elders of the Church, ſaying, Acts 20.32. <hi>And now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among all them which are ſanctified.</hi> He doth not commend them here to outward Laws or Writings, but to the <hi>Word of Grace,</hi> which is Inward, even the <hi>Spiritual Law,</hi> which makes free, as he elſewhere affirms, Rom. 8.2. <hi>The Law of the</hi> Spirit of Life <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> This Spiritual Law is that which the Apoſtle declares he preached and directed People unto, which was not outward, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. is manifeſt; where, diſtinguiſhing it from the Law, he ſaith, <hi>The Word is nigh thee, in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth; and this is the Word of Faith which we preach.</hi> From what is aboveſaid, I argue thus:</p>

               <p>But in that there are many hundreds of things, with a regard to their Circumſtances, particular Chriſtians may be concerned in, for which, there can be no particular Rule had in the Scriptures:</p>
               <p>Therefore the Scriptures cannot be a Rule to them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give an Inſtance in two or three Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, for to prove this Propoſition. It is not to be doubted, but ſome Men are particularly called to ſome particular Services; their being not found in which, tho' the Act be no general poſitive Duty; yet in ſo far as it may be required of them, is a great Sin to omit: For as much as God is zealous of his Glory, and every Act of Diſobedience to his Will manifeſted, is enough not only to hinder one greatly from that Comfort and inward Grace, which otherwiſe they might have, but alſo bringeth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p>As for Inſtance: Some are called to the Miniſtry of the Word; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There was a neceſſity upon him to preach the Goſpel; Wo unto me, if I preach not.</hi>

               <p>Next again, By what Rule ſhall I judge, if I be ſo qualified? How do I know that I am <hi>ſober, meek, holy, harmleſs?</hi> Is not the Teſtimony of the Spirit in my Conſcience that which muſt aſſure me hereof? And ſuppoſe that I was Qualified and Called, yet what Scripture-Rule ſhall inform me, whether it be my duty to preach in this or that place, in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England, Holland</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi>; Whether I ſhall take up my Time in confirming the Faithful, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming Hereticks, or Converting Infidels, as alſo in Writing Epiſtles to this or that Church?</p>
               <p>The general Rules of the Scripture, viz. <hi>To be diligent in my Duty, to do all to the</hi> Glory of God, <hi>and for the good of his Church,</hi> can give me no light in this thing. Seeing two different things may both have a reſpect to that way, yet may I commit a great Error and Offence, in doing the one, when I am called to the other. If <hi>Paul,</hi> when his Face was turned by the Lord toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had gone back to <hi>Achaia,</hi> or <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he might have ſuppoſed he could have done God more acceptable Service, in Preaching and confirming the Churches, than in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut up in Priſon in <hi>Judea</hi>; but would God have been pleaſed herewith? Nay certainly. <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice</hi>; and it is not our doing that which is good ſimply, that pleaſeth God, but that

good which he willeth us to do. Every Member hath its particular place in the Body, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. If then, I being the Foot, ſhould offer to exerciſe the Office of the Hand; or being the Hand, that of the Tongue, my Service would be troubleſome, and not acceptable; and inſtead of helping the Body, I ſhould make a <hi>Schiſm</hi> in it.<note place="margin">That which is good for one to do, may be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> So that, that which is good for another to do, may be ſinful for me: For, as Maſters will have their Servants to obey them, according to their good pleaſure, and not only in blindly doing that, which may ſeem to them to tend to their Maſter's profit; whereby it may chance (the Maſter having buſineſs both in the Field and in the Houſe) that the Servant, that knows not his Maſter's will, may go to the Field, when it is the mind of the Maſter he ſhould ſtay, and do the buſineſs of the Houſe: Would not this Servant then deſerve a Reproof, for not anſwering his Maſter's mind? And what Maſter is ſo ſottiſh and careleſs, as having many Servants, leaves them in ſuch diſorder, as not to aſſign each his particular Station, and not only the general term of, Doing that which is profitable; which would leave them in various doubts, and no doubt, end in confuſion?</p>
               <p>Shall we then dare to aſcribe unto Chriſt, in the ordering of his Church and Servants, that which in Man might juſtly be accounted Diſorder and Confuſion? The Apoſtle ſheweth this diſtinction well,<note place="margin">Diverſities of Gifts.</note>

               <p>Moreover, That which of all things is moſt needful for him to know, to wit,<note place="margin">Of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can</hi> the Scripture aſſure thee?</note> whether he really be in the Faith, and an Heir of Salvation, or no, the Scripture can give him no certainty in, neither can it be a Rule to him.

               </p>
               <p>I demand, Wherewith ſhall I make this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? What ſhall aſcertain me, that I am not miſtaken? It cannot be the Scripture: That's the Matter under Debate.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, <hi>My own Heart</hi>:</p>
               <p>How unfit a Judge is it in its own caſe? And how like to be partial, eſpecially if it be yet unrenewed?<note place="margin">The Heart of Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.</note> Doth not the Scripture ſay, That <hi>it is deceitful above all things?</hi> I find the Promiſes, I find the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, in the Scripture; but who telleth me, that the one belongs to me, more than the other? The <hi>Scripture</hi> gives me a meer Declaration of theſe things, but makes no Application; ſo that the Aſſumption muſt be of my own making, thus; as for Example: I find this Propoſition in the Scripture;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that believes, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Thence I draw this Aſſumption,</p>
               <p>But I, <hi>Robert, believe</hi>:</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>I ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is of my own making, not expreſſed in the Scripture; and ſo a Humane Concluſion, not a Divine Poſition; ſo that my Faith and Aſſurance
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:003129_0046_0FF0045D8CBC6BF8"/>
here, is not built upon a Scripture Propoſition, but upon a Humane Principle; which, unleſs I be ſure of elſewhere, the Scripture gives me no certainty in the matter.</p>
               <p>Again, If I ſhould purſue the Argument further, and ſeek a new <hi>Medium</hi> out of the Scripture, the ſame difficulty would occur, thus:</p>
               <p>He that hath the true and certain Marks of true Faith hath true Faith.</p>
               <p>But I have thoſe Marks:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore,</hi> I have true Faith.</p>
               <p>For the Aſſumption is ſtill here of my own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and is not found in the Scriptures; and by conſequence the Concluſion can be no better, ſince it ſtill followeth the weaker Propoſition. This is indeed ſo pungent,<note place="margin">The Inward Teſtimony of the Spirit the Seal of Scripture. Promiſes.</note> that the beſt of Proteſtants, who plead for this Aſſurance, aſcribe it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teſtimony of the Spirit, (as <hi>Calvin,</hi> in that large Citation, cited in the former Propoſition) ſo that, not to ſeek further into the Writings of the Primitive Proteſtants, (which are full of ſuch Expreſſions) even the <hi>Weſtminster</hi> Confeſſion of Faith affirmeth, <hi>Chap</hi> 18. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.
<q>This certainty is not a bare Conjecture and probable Perſwaſion, grounded upon Fallible Hope, but an Infallible Aſſurance of Faith, founded upon the Divine Truth of the Promiſe of Salvation; the inward Evidences of theſe Graces, unto which theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made; the Teſtimony of the Spirit of Adoption, witneſſing to our Spirits, that we are the Children of God; which Spirit is the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of our <hi>Inheritance, whereby we are ſealed to the day of Redemption.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, The Scripture it ſelf, wherein we are ſo earneſtly preſſed to ſeek after this Aſſurance, doth not at all affirm it ſelf a <hi>Rule</hi> ſufficient to give it, but wholly aſcribeth it to the Spirit, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The</hi> Spirit <hi>it ſelf heareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the Children of God.</hi> 1 John 4.13. <hi>Hereby know we

we have with the ſame Spirit and Work in our Hearts. The Prophecies of the Scriptures are alſo very comfortable and profitable unto us, as the ſame Spirit inlightens us, to obſerve them fulfilled, and to be fulfilled: For in all this, it is to be obſerved, that it is only the Spiritual Man that can make a right uſe of them: They are able to make the Man of God perfect, (ſo it is not the Natural Man) and whatſoever was written afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, was written for <hi>our comfort, [our]</hi> that are the Believers, [<hi>our</hi>] that are the Saints; concerning ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaks: For as for the other, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> plainly declares, that the <hi>unstable and unlearned wreſt them to their own Deſtruction</hi>: Theſe were they that were unlearned in the Divine and Heavenly Learning of the Spirit, not in Humane and School Literature; in which, we may ſafely preſume, that <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, being a Fiſher-man, had no skill; for it may, with great probability, yea certainty, be affirmed, that he had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Logick,<note place="margin">Logick.</note> which both Papiſts and Proteſtants, now degenerating from the Simplicity of Truth, make the Hand-maid of Divinity (as they call it) and a neceſſary Introduction to their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, natural and humane Miniſtry. By the infinite obſcure Labours of which kind of Men, mixing in their Heatheniſh Stuff, the Scripture is rendred at this day of ſo little ſervice to the ſimple People: Whereof if <hi>Jerom</hi> complained in his time, now Twelve Hundred Years ago, <hi>Hierom</hi> Epiſt. 134. ad <hi>Cypr.</hi> tom. 3. ſaying, <hi>It is wont to befal the moſt part of Learned Men, that it is harder to underſtand their Expoſitions, than the things which they go about to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound</hi>; What may we ſay then, conſidering thoſe great Heaps of Commentaries ſince, in Ages yet far more corrupted?</p>

the Church of God; wherefore we do account them a Secondary Rule.<note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Rule.</note> Moreover, becauſe they are commonly acknowledged by all, to have been written by the Dictates of the Holy Spirit, and that the Errors, which may be ſuppoſed by the Injury of Times to have ſlipt in are not ſuch, but that there is a ſufficient clear Teſtimony left to all the Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Faith; we do look upon them, as the only fit outward Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies among Chriſtians; and that whatſoever Doctrine is contrary unto their Teſtimony, may therefore juſtly be rejected as Falſe. And for our parts, we are very willing, that all our Doctrines and Practices be tried by them; which we never refuſed, nor ever ſhall, in all Controverſies with our Adverſaries, as the Judge and Teſt. We ſhall alſo be very willing to admit it, as a poſitive cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Maxim, <hi>That whatſoever any do, pretending to the</hi> Spirit, <hi>which is contrary to the</hi> Scriptures, <hi>be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and reckoned a Deluſion of the Devil.</hi> For as we never lay claim to the Spirit's Leadings, that we may cover our ſelves in any thing that is Evil; ſo we know, that as every Evil contradicts the Scriptures, ſo it doth alſo the Spirit in the firſt place, from which the Scriptures came, and whoſe Motions can never contradict one another, tho' they may appear ſometimes to be contradictory to the Blind Eye of the Natural Man, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> ſeem to contradict one another.</p>

They make the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, the offer of Salvation by Chriſt, the Uſe of the Sacraments, of Prayer and good Works, ſufficient to Condemn thoſe they account <hi>Reprobates</hi> within the Church; ſerving only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, to beget a ſeeming Faith, and vain Hope; yet, becauſe of a ſecret Impotency, which they had from their Infancy, all theſe are wholly ineffectual to bring them the leaſt ſtep towards Salvation; and do only contribute to render their Condemnation the greater, and their Torments the more violent and intolerable.</p>

                     <hi>Chriſt then taſted Death for every Man, of all kinds.</hi> Such is the Evidence of this Truth, delivered almoſt wholly in the expreſs words of Scripture, that it will not need much Probation.

This Doctrine of <hi>Univerſal Redemption,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt's dying for all Men,</hi> is of it ſelf ſo evident from the Scripture-Teſtimony, that there is ſcarce found any other Article of the Chriſtian Faith, ſo frequently, ſo plainly, and ſo poſitively Aſſerted. It is that, which maketh the Preaching of Chriſt to be truly termed the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or an <hi>Annunciation of Glad-Tidings to all.</hi> Thus the Angel declared the Birth and Coming of Chriſt to the Shepherds to be, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. <hi>Behold, I bring you good Tidings of great Joy, which ſhall be to All People</hi>: He ſaith not, <hi>to a Few.</hi> Now if this Coming of Chriſt had not brought a Poſſibility of Salvation <hi>to all,</hi> it ſhould rather have been accounted, Bad Tidings of great Sorrow to moſt People; neither ſhould the Angel have had reaſon to have ſung, <hi>Peace on Earth, and good Will towards Men,</hi> if the greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had been neceſſarily ſhut out from receiving any benefit by it. How ſhould Chriſt have ſent cut His to <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> Mark 16.15. (a very Comprehenſive Commiſſion) that is, <hi>to every Son and Daughter of Mankind,</hi> without all Exception? He commands them to preach <hi>Salvation to all, Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins to all; Warning every one, and Exhorting every one,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28.<note place="margin">The Goſpel is preached to <hi>every Man.</hi>
                     </note> Now how could they have preached the Goſpel <hi>to every Man,</hi> as became the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, in much aſſurance, if Salvation by that Goſpel had not been poſſible unto all?

To this they can anſwer
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:003129_0066_0FF00489F0C532F0"/>
nothing; unleſs they run in a Circle. Whereas the <hi>Feet of thoſe, that bring the glad Tidings of the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Beautiful</hi>; for that they preach the <hi>Common Salvation,</hi> Repentance unto All; offering a Door of Mercy and Hope to All, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>gave himſelf a Ranſom for All.</hi> The Goſpel invites All: And certainly by the Goſpel, <hi>Christ</hi> intended not to deceive and delude the greater part of Mankind, when he invites, and cryeth, ſaying; <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> If <hi>All</hi> then ought to ſeek after him, and to look for Salvation by him, he muſt needs have made Salvation <hi>poſſible</hi> to <hi>All:</hi> For who is bound to ſeek after that, which is impoſſible? Certainly it were a <hi>Mocking of Men,</hi> to bid them do ſo. And ſuch as deny, that by the Death of Chriſt, <hi>Salvation</hi> is made <hi>poſſible to all Men,</hi> do moſt Blaſphemouſly make God mock the World, in giving his Servants a Commiſſion to <hi>Preach the Goſpel of Salvation unto all,</hi> while he hath before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that it ſhall not be Poſſible for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.<note place="margin">The Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Abſolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </note> Would not this make the Lord to ſend forth his Servants with a <hi>Lye in their Mouth,</hi> (which were Blaſphemous to think) commanding them, to bid <hi>All</hi> and <hi>Every One</hi> Believe, That Chriſt died for them, and had purchaſed Life and Salvation: Whereas it is no ſuch thing, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Doctrine? But ſeeing Chriſt, after he aroſe, and perfected the Work of our Redemption, gave a Commiſſion to preach Repentance, Remiſſion of Sins, and Salvation to all; it is manifeſt, that he <hi>died for all.</hi> For He that hath Commiſſionated his Servants thus to Preach, is a God of Truth, and no Mocker of poor Mankind; neither doth he require of any Man, that which is ſimply impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to do: For that <hi>no Man is bound to do that which is impoſſible,</hi> is a Principle of Truth, ingraven in every Man's Mind. And ſeeing he is both a moſt Righteous and Merciful God, it

cannot at all ſtand either with his Juſtice or Mercy, to bid ſuch Men <hi>Repent</hi> or <hi>Believe,</hi> to whom it is impoſſible.</p>

And this Scripture doth well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that manner of Arguing, which we have hitherto uſed: For, firſt, the Apoſtle here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them to <hi>Pray for all Men</hi>: And to obviate ſuch an Objection, as if he had ſaid with our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, <hi>Christ prayed not for the World, neither wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth be us to pray for all; becauſe he willeth not that all ſhould be ſaved, but hath ordained many to be damned, that he might ſhew forth his Juſtice to them</hi>; he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viates,<note place="margin">—And will have <hi>all</hi> Men to be ſaved.</note> I ſay, ſuch an Objection, telling them, that <hi>it is good and acceptable in the ſight of God, who will have all Men to be ſaved.</hi> I deſire to know, what can be more expreſly affirmed, or can any two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions be ſtated in terms more contradictory, than theſe two; <hi>God willeth not ſome to be ſaved</hi>; and <hi>God willeth all Men to be ſaved,</hi> or <hi>God will have no Man periſh.</hi> If we believe the laſt, as the Apoſtle hath affirmed, the firſt muſt be deſtroyed; ſeeing of Contradictory Propoſitions, the one being placed, the other is deſtroyed. Whence (to conclude) he gives us a Reaſon of his Willingneſs, that all Men ſhould be ſaved, in theſe words, <hi>Who gave himſelf a

                     <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This Aſſumption no Man can deny, ſeing <hi>His Mercies</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>over all his Works.</hi> And herein the Scripture every way declares the <hi>Mercy

of God</hi> to be, in that he invites and calls Sinners to Repentance, and hath opened a Way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them: So that, though thoſe Men be not bound to believe the <hi>Hiſtory of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion,</hi> who never came to know of it; yet they are bound to believe, that God will be merciful to them, if they follow his ways; and that he is merciful unto them, in that he reproves them for Evil,<note place="margin">Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries unmerciful Aſſertion of God.</note> and incourages them to Good. Neither ought any Man to believe, that God is unmerciful to him, or that he hath from the beginning ordained him to come into the World, that he might be left to his own Evil Inclinations, and ſo do wickedly, as a Means appointed by God, to bring him to Eternal Damnation; which, were it true, as our Adverſaries affirm it to be of many Thouſands, I ſee no reaſon why a Man might not believe it; for certainly a Man may believe the Truth.</p>
                  <p>As it manifeſtly appears, from the thing it ſelf, that theſe good and excellent Conſequences follow, from the Belief of this Doctrine; ſo from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of them, it will yet more evidently appear.

but mediately, as he is in that <hi>Seed,</hi> which is <hi>in us</hi>; whereas he, to wit, the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> which was with God, and was God, dwelt immediately in that Holy Man. He then is as the Head, and we as the Members; he the Vine, and we the Branches. Now, as the Soul of Man dwells otherwiſe, and in a far more immediate manner, in the Head and in the Heart, than in the Hands or Legs; and as the Sap, Virtue, and Life of the Vine lodgeth far otherwiſe in the Stock and Root, than in the Branches; ſo God dwelleth otherwiſe in the Man <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than in us. We alſo freely reject the Hereſie of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> who deny'd him to have any Soul, but ſaid, The Body was only acted by the God-head: As alſo the Error of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who made the Manhood to be wholly ſwallowed up of the God-head. Wherefore, as we believe he was a true and real Man; ſo we alſo believe, that he continues ſo to be Glorified in the Heavens, in Soul and Body, by whom God ſhall Judge the World, in the great and general Day of Judgment.</p>

                     <hi>We do not hereby intend any ways to leſſen or derogate from the</hi> Atonement <hi>and</hi> Sacrifice <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; but on the contrary, do magnifie and exalt it. For, as we believe all thoſe things to have been certainly tranſacted, which are recorded in the Holy Scriptures, concerning the <hi>Birth, Life, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Sufferings, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt</hi>; ſo we do alſo believe, that it is the Duty of every one to believe it, to whom it pleaſes God to reveal the fame, and to bring to them the Knowledge of it; yea, we believe it were <hi>Damnable Unbelief</hi> not to believe it, when ſo declared, but to reſiſt that Holy Seed, which, if minded, would lead and incline every one to believe it, as it is offered unto them; tho' it revealeth not in every one the outward and explicit Knowledge of it, nevertheleſs it always aſſenteth to it, <hi>ubi declaratur,</hi> where it is declared.

                     <note place="margin">Qu. 5.</note>But <hi>Fifthly</hi>; This brings us to another Queſtion, to wit,<note place="margin">How Chriſt is in all Men.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether Chriſt be in all Men, or no?</hi> Which ſometimes hath been asked us, and Arguments brought againſt it; becauſe indeed it is to be found in ſome of our Writings that <hi>Chriſt is in all Men</hi>; and we often are heard, in our publick <hi>Meetings</hi> and <hi>Declarations,</hi> to deſire every Man to know and be acquainted with <hi>Chriſt in them</hi>; telling them, that <hi>Christ is in them.</hi> It is fit therefore, for it moving of all Miſtakes, to ſay ſomething in this place concerning this matter. We have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how that a <hi>Divine, Spiritual and Supernatural Light is in all Men</hi>; how that <hi>that Divine Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light or Seed is</hi> Vehiculum Dei; how that <hi>God and Chriſt dwelleth in it, and is never ſeparated from it</hi>; alſo how that <hi>(as it is received and cloſed with in the Heart) Christ comes to be formed and brought
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:003129_0078_0FF004A53940B530"/>
forth</hi>: But we are far from ever having ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt is thus formed in all Men,</hi> or <hi>in the Wicked:</hi> For that is a great Attainment; which the Apoſtle travelled, that it might be brought forth in the <hi>Galatians.</hi> Neither is <hi>Chriſt in all Men</hi> by way of <hi>Union,</hi> or indeed, to ſpeak ſtrictly, by way of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation</hi>; becauſe this <hi>Inhabitation,</hi> as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken, imports <hi>Union,</hi> or <hi>the manner of Chriſt's being in the Saints:</hi> As it is written, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. But in regard <hi>Chriſt is in all Men,</hi> as in a Seed, yea, and that he never is, nor can be, ſeparate from that holy, pure Seed <hi>and</hi> Light, which is <hi>in All Men</hi>; therefore may it be ſaid in a larger Senſe, that he is <hi>in All,</hi> even as we obſerved before. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.13. God <hi>is preſſed down as a Cart under Sheaves</hi>; and <hi>Chriſt crucified in the Ungodly</hi>: Tho' to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and ſtrictly, neither can God be <hi>preſſed down,</hi> nor Chriſt, as God, be <hi>crucified.</hi> In this reſpect then, as he is <hi>in the Seed,</hi> which is <hi>in All Men,</hi> we have ſaid, <hi>Chriſt is in All Men,</hi> and have preached and directed All Men to <hi>Christ in them</hi>;<note place="margin">Chriſt crucified in Man by Iniquities.</note> who lies crucified in them, by their Sins and Iniquities; that they may <hi>look upon him, whom they have pierced,</hi> and repent: Whereby He, that now lies as it were ſlain and buried <hi>in them,</hi> may come to be raiſed, and have dominion in their Hearts over all. And thus alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. <hi>Chriſt crucified in them,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Greek hath it: This <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was that which the Apoſtle deſired to know <hi>in them,</hi> and make known <hi>unto them,</hi> that they might come to be ſenſible, how they had thus been <hi>Crucifying Chriſt</hi>; that ſo they might Repent and be Saved. And foraſmuch as Chriſt is called that <hi>Light, that enlightens every Man, The Light of the World</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Light</hi> is taken for <hi>Christ,</hi> who truly is the Fountain of <hi>Light,</hi> and hath his Habitation in it for ever. Thus the <hi>Light of Chriſt</hi> is ſometimes
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:003129_0079_0FF004A715B649E0"/>
called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> i. e. that in which Chriſt is, and from which he is never ſeparated.</p>
                  <p n="16">§. XVI. <hi>Sixthly</hi>; It will manifeſtly appear, by what is above-ſaid, that <hi>we underſtand not this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Principle to be any part of Man's Nature, nor yet to be any Reliques of any good, which</hi> Adam <hi>loſt by his Fall</hi>; in that we make it a diſtinct ſeparate thing from Man's Soul, and all the Faculties of it: Yet ſuch is the <hi>Malice</hi> of our Adverſaries, that they ceaſe not ſometimes to Calumniate us, as if we preached up a Natural Light, or the Light of Man's Natural Conſcience. Next, There are that lean to the Doctrine of <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who perſwade themſelves, through miſtake, and out of no ill deſign to Injure us, as if this which we Preach up, were ſome Natural Power and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Soul, and that we only differ in the wording of it, and not in the thing it ſelf: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there can be no greater difference, than is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us in that matter: For we certainly know, that this <hi>Light,</hi> of which we ſpeak, is not only diſtinct, but of a different Nature from the Soul of Man,<note place="margin">The Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mans Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> and its Faculties. Indeed that Man, as he is a Rational Creature, hath Reaſon as a natural Faculty of his Soul, by which he can diſcern things that are Rational, we deny not; for this is a property natural and eſſential to him, by which he can know and learn many Arts and Sciences, beyond what any other Animal can do, by the meer Animal Principle. Neither do we deny, but by this Rational Principle, Man may apprehend in his Brain, and in the Notion, a Knowledge of God, and Spiritual Things: Yet, that not being the right Organ, as in the Second Propoſition hath more at length been ſignified, it cannot profit him towards Salvation; but rather hindreth; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the great cauſe of the Apoſtacy hath been, that Man hath ſought to fathom the things of God, in and by this Natural and Rational Principle,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:003129_0079_0FF004A715B649E0"/>
and to build up a Religion in it, neglecting and over-looking this Principle and Seed of God in the Heart; ſo that herein, in the moſt Univerſal and Catholick Senſe, hath <hi>Antichriſt in every man ſet up himſelf, and ſitteth in the</hi> Temple of God,<note place="margin">Antichriſt in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</note> 
                     <hi>as</hi> God, <hi>and above every thing that is called</hi> God. For, <hi>men being the Temple of the Holy Ghost,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. when the Rational Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſets it ſelf up there above the Seed of God, to reign and rule as a Prince in Spiritual Things, while the Holy Seed is wounded and bruiſed; there is <hi>Antichrist in every man,</hi> or ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above and againſt Chriſt. Nevertheleſs, we do not hereby affirm, as if Man had received his Reaſon to no purpoſe, or to be of no ſervice unto him, in no wiſe: We look upon Reaſon as fit to order and rule Man in things Natural.<note place="margin">The Divine Light, and Natural Reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</note> For as God gave two great Lights to rule the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward World, the Sun and Moon; the greater Light to rule the Day, and the leſſer Light to rule the Night: So hath he given Man the Light of his Son, a Spiritual Divine Light, to rule him in things Spiritual; and the Light of Reaſon to rule him in things Natural. And even as the Moon borrows her Light from the Sun, ſo ought Men (if they would be rightly and comfortably ordered in Natural Things) to have their Reaſon inlightned by this Divine and Pure Light. Which inlightned Reaſon in thoſe that obey and follow this true Light, we confeſs may be uſeful to Man, even in Spiritual Things, as it is ſtill ſubſervient, and ſubject to the other; even as the Animal Life in Man, regulated and ordered by his Reaſon, helps him in going about things that are Rational. We do further rightly diſtinguiſh this from Mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience;<note place="margin">The Light <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed</hi> from Man's natural Conſcience.</note> for Conſcience being that in Man, which ariſeth from the Natural Faculties of Man's Soul, may be defiled and corrupted: It is ſaid expreſly of the Impute, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. <hi>That even
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:003129_0080_0FF004A8F9C759F0"/>
their Mind and Conſcience is defiled.</hi> But this Light can never be corrupted nor defiled; neither did it ever conſent to Evil or Wickedneſs in any; for it is ſaid expreſly, that <hi>it makes all things manifeſt that are reprovable,</hi> Eph. 5.13. And ſo is a faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for God,<note place="margin">Conſcience <hi>defined.</hi>
                     </note> againſt every Unrighteouſneſs <hi>in Man.</hi> Now <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to define it truly, comes from <hi>(Conſcire)</hi> and <hi>is that Knowledge, which ariſeth in Man's Heart, from what agreeth, contradicteth, or is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any thing believed by him; whereby he becomes Conſcious to himſelf, that he tranſgreſſeth, by doing that which he is perſwaded, he ought not to do.</hi> So that the Mind being once blinded, or defiled with a wrong Belief, there raiſeth a Conſcience from that Belief, which troubles him, when he goes againſt it. As for Example:<note place="margin">Example of a <hi>Turk.</hi>
                     </note> A <hi>Turk</hi> who hath poſſeſſed himſelf with a falſe Belief, that it is unlawful for him to drink Wine; if he do it, his Conſcience ſmites him for it: But tho' he keep many Concubines, his Conſcience troubles him not; becauſe his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is already defiled with a falſe Opinion, that it is lawful for him to do the one, and unlawful to do the other. Whereas if the Light of Chriſt in him were minded, it would reprove him, not only for committing Fornication; but alſo, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient thereunto, inform him that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was an <hi>Impostor</hi>; as well as <hi>Socrates</hi> was informed by it, in his day, of the Falſity of the Heathen's Gods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Example of a <hi>Papiſt</hi>
                     </note>So, if a <hi>Papiſt</hi> eat Fleſh in <hi>Lent,</hi> or be not dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enough in Adoration of Saints and Images, or if he ſhould Condemn Images, his Conſcience would ſmite him for it; becauſe his Judgment is already blinded with a falſe Belief concerning theſe things: Whereas the Light of Chriſt never conſented to any of thoſe Abominations. Thus then Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience is ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from it; for Conſcience followeth the Judgment, doth not inform it; but this Light, as it is received,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:003129_0080_0FF004A8F9C759F0"/>
removes the Blindneſs of the Judgment, opens the Underſtanding, and rectifies both the Judgment and Conſcience. So we confeſs alſo, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is an excellent thing, where it is rightly informed and inlightned: Wherefore ſome of us have fitly compared it to the Lanthorn,<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Compared to a <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,</hi> and the Light of Chriſt the <hi>Candle.</hi>
                     </note> and the Light of Chriſt to a Candle: A Lanthorn is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when a clear Candle burns and ſhines in it; but otherwiſe of no uſe. To the Light of Chriſt then, in the Conſcience, and not to Man's Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſcience, it is, that we continually commend Men; this, not that, is it which we preach up, and direct People to, as to a moſt certain Guide unto Life Eternal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> This <hi>Light, Seed,</hi> &amp;c. appears to be no Power or Natural Faculty of Man's Mind; becauſe a Man that's in his Health, can, when he pleaſes, ſtir up, move and exerciſe the Faculties of his Soul; he is abſolute Maſter of them; and except there be ſome natural Cauſe or Impediment in the way, he can uſe them at his pleaſure: But this <hi>Light and Seed of God in Man,</hi> he cannot move and ſtir up when he pleaſeth; but it moves, blows, and ſtrives with Man, as the Lord ſeeth meet. For, tho' there be a Poſſibility of Salvation to every Man, during the Day of his Viſitation; yet cannot a Man, at any time, when he pleaſeth, or hath ſome ſenſe of his <hi>Miſery,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of the Light and Grace.</note> ſtir up that Light and Grace, ſo as to procure to himſelf ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Heart; but he muſt wait for it: Which comes upon all, at certain times and ſeaſons, wherein it works powerfully upon the Soul, mightily tenders it, and breaks it; at which time, if Man reſiſt it not, but cloſes with it, he comes to know Salvation by it. Even as the Lake of <hi>Betheſda</hi> did not Cure all thoſe, that waſhed in it; but ſuch only, as waſhed firſt, after the Angel had moved upon the Waters; ſo God moves in Love to Mankind, in this Seed in his Heart, at ſome
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:003129_0081_0FF004AC6BD40050"/>
ſingular times, ſetting his Sins in order before him, and ſeriouſly inviting him to Repentance, offering to him Remiſſion of Sins and Salvation; which, if Man accept of, he may be ſaved. Now there is no Man alive, and I am confident there ſhall be none to whom this Paper ſhall come, who, if they will deal faithfully and honeſtly with their own Hearts but muſt be forced to acknowledge, they have been ſenſible of this in ſome meaſure leſs or more; which is a thing, that Man cannot bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, with all his Pains and Induſtry. This then, O Man and Woman! is the Day of God's gracious Viſitation to thy Soul, which thou ſhalt be happy for ever, if thou reſiſt not. This is the Day of the Lord, which as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>is like the Lightning which ſhineth from the</hi> Eaſt <hi>unto the</hi> Weſt;<note place="margin">Mat. 24.27.</note> and the <hi>Wind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit, which blows upon the Heart,</hi>

his Salvation: So that in him that is ſaved, the working is of the Grace, and not of the Man; and it's a Paſſiveneſs, rather than an act; tho' after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as Man is wrought upon, there is a Will raiſed in him, by which he comes to be a co-worker with the Grace: For according to that of <hi>Augustin, He that made us without us, will not ſave us without us.</hi> So that the firſt ſtep is not by Man's working, but by his not contrary-working. And we believe that at theſe ſingular Seaſons of every Man's Viſitation, above-mentioned; as Man is wholly unable of himſelf to work with the Grace, neither can he move one ſtep out of the Natural Condition, until the Grace lay hold upon him; ſo it is poſſible to him to be paſſive, and not to reſiſt it, as it is poſſible for him to reſiſt it. So we ſay, the Grace of God works in and upon Man's Nature; which, tho' of it ſelf wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and defiled, and prone to Evil; yet is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be wrought upon by the Grace of God; even as Iron, tho' a hard and cold Metal of it ſelf, may be warm'd and ſoftned by the heat of the Fire, and Wax melted by the Sun. And as Iron or Wax, when removed from the Fire or Sun, returneth to its former condition of coldneſs and hardneſs: So Man's Heart, as it reſiſts, or retires from the Grace of God, returns to its former condition again. I have often had the manner of God's Working, in order to Salvation towards all Men, illuſtrated to my Mind, by one or two clear Examples, which I ſhall here add, for the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>Of a Man heavily diſeaſed</hi>; to whom I compare Man in his fallen and natural Condition.<note place="margin">The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed Man and the Phyſician.</note> I ſuppoſe God, who is the great Phyſician, not only to give this Man Phyſick, after he hath uſed all the Induſtry he can for his own Health, by any skill or knowledge of his own: (As thoſe that ſay, <hi>If a Man improve his Reaſon, or Natural Faculties,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:003129_0082_0FF004AEA63EE8A8"/>
God will ſuper-add Grace: Or,</hi> as others ſay, <hi>That he cometh and maketh offer of a Remedy to this Man out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, leaving it to the liberty of Man's Will, either to receive it, or reject it.</hi>) But He, even the Lord, this great Phyſician, cometh, and poureth the Remedy into his Mouth, and as it were layeth him in his Bed; ſo that if the Sick Man be but paſſive, it will neceſſarily work the Effect: But if he be ſtubborn and untoward, and will needs ariſe up and go forth into the cold, or eat ſuch Fruits as are hurtful to him, while the <hi>Medicine</hi> ſhould operate; then, tho' of its nature it tendeth to cure him; yet it will prove deſtructive to him, becauſe of thoſe Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which it meeteth with. Now, as the Man that ſhould thus undo himſelf, would certainly be the cauſe of his own Death; ſo who will ſay, that if cured, he owes not his Health wholly to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and not to any Deed of his own; ſeeing his part was not any Action, but a Paſſiveneſs?</p>

But I ſuppoſe, that the Deliverer comes at certain times, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovers and informs them of the great Miſery
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:003129_0082_0FF004AEA63EE8A8"/>
and Hazard they are in, if they continue in that Noyſom and Peſtiferous Place; yea, forces them to a certain Senſe of their Miſery (for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edeſt Men, at times, are made ſenſible of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery by God's Viſitation) and not only ſo, but lays hold upon them, and gives them a pull, in order to lift them out of their miſery: Which, if they reſiſt not, will ſave them; only they may reſiſt it. This being applied as the former, doth the ſame way illuſtrate the matter. Neither is the Grace of God fruſtrated, though the Effect of it be divers, according to its Object; being the <hi>Miniſtration of Mercy and Love,</hi> in thoſe that reject it not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. but the <hi>Miniſtration of Wrath and Condemnation,</hi> in thoſe that do reject it, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. Even as the Sun, by one Act or Operation,<note place="margin">A <hi>Simile</hi> of the Sun's melting and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening <hi>&amp;c.</hi> power.</note> melteth and ſoftneth the Wax, and hardeneth the Clay. The nature of the Sun is to cheriſh the Creation, and therefore the Living are refreſhed by it, and the Flowers ſend forth a good ſavour, as it ſhines upon them, and the Fruits of the Trees are ripened; yet caſt forth a dead Carcaſe, a thing without Life, and the ſame reflection of the Sun will cauſe it to ſtink, and putrifie it; yet is not the Sun ſaid thereby to be fruſtrated of its proper effect. So every Man, during the Day of his Viſitation, is ſhined upon by the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being influenced by it, ſo as to ſend forth good Fruit, and a good Savour, and to be melted by it; but when he hath ſinned out his Day, then the ſame Sun hardeneth him, as it doth the Clay, and makes his Wickedneſs more to appear and putrifie, and ſend forth an evil Savour.</p>
                  <p n="18">§.

For it were abſurd to ſay, that God had not far otherwiſe extended himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> than towards many others: Neither can we affirm, that God equally loved the Beloved Diſciple <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitor; yet ſo far, nevertheleſs, as none wanted ſuch a meaſure of Grace, by which they might have been ſaved; all are juſtly Inexcuſable.

                  <p>The firſt is deduced from theſe places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein God ſeems preciſely to have decreed and predeſtinated ſome to Salvation; and for that end, to have ordained certain means, which fall not out to others; as in the Calling of <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> and others, and in the Converſion of <hi>Paul</hi>; for theſe being numbred among ſuch, to whom this prevalency is given, the Objection is eaſily looſed.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is drawn from thoſe places, wherein God ſeems to have ordain'd ſome wicked Perſons

Fountain of all Truth and Equity, it was poſſible in a Day, even for <hi>Cain</hi> to be accepted.

It is then the fear of Perſecution, and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Riches (as Chriſt himſelf interpreteth the Parable) which hindereth this Seed to grow in the Hearts of many: Not but that, in its own nature, it is ſufficient; being the ſame with that which groweth up and proſpereth in the Hearts of thoſe who receive it.

grow up, and redeem the Soul, if it were not choked and hindered. Concerning this Parable, <hi>Victor Antiochenus</hi> (on <hi>Mark</hi> 4. as he is cited by <hi>Veſſius,</hi> in his <hi>Pelogian Hiſtory,</hi> Book 7.) ſaith, That <hi>Our Lord Christ hath liberally ſown the</hi> Divine Seed of the Word, <hi>and propoſed it to All, without Reſpect of Perſons; and as be that ſoweth, diſtinguiſheth not betwixt</hi> Ground and Ground, <hi>but ſimply caſteth in the</hi> Seed, <hi>without diſtinction; ſo our Saviour hath offered the Food of the Divine Word, ſo far as was his part; altho' he was not ignorant what would become of many.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>He ſo behaved himſelf, as he might justly ſay, What ſhould I have done, that I have not done?</hi> And ſo this anſwereth the Parable of the <hi>Talents, Mat.</hi> 25. he that had <hi>two Talents</hi> was accepted, as well as he that had <hi>five,</hi> becauſe he uſed them to his Maſter's profit: And he that had one, might have done ſo; his <hi>Talent</hi> was of the ſame nature with the reſt, it was as capable to have proportionably brought forth its intereſt, as the reſt. And ſo, tho' there be not a like proportion of Grace given to <hi>All,</hi> to ſome <hi>five Talents,</hi> to ſome <hi>two Talents,</hi> and to ſome but <hi>one Talent</hi>; yet there is given to All, that which is ſufficient; and no more is required, than accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which is given: <hi>For unto whomſoever much is given, from him much ſhall be required,</hi> Luke 12.48.

Declaration of the Goſpel be taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the Goſpel; yet it is but Figuratively, and by a <hi>Metonymy.</hi> For, to ſpeak properly, the Goſpel is this <hi>Inward Power</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Glad Tidings</hi> in the Hearts of all Men, offering Salvation unto them, and ſeeking to Redeem them from their Iniquities; and therefore it is ſaid to be preached <hi>In every Creature under Heaven:</hi> Whereas there are many Thouſands of Men and Women, to whom the outward Goſpel was never preached. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 1. where he ſaith, <hi>The</hi> Goſpel <hi>is the</hi> Power of God <hi>unto Salvation,</hi> adds. That <hi>therein is revealed the</hi> Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>from Faith to Faith</hi>; and alſo the <hi>Wrath of God againſt ſuch as hold the Truth of God in unrighteouſneſs:</hi> For this reaſon (ſaith he) <hi>Becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them; for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> Now, that which may be known of God, is known by the Goſpel, which was manifeſt in them. For thoſe, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, had no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Goſpel preached unto them; ſo that it was by the inward Manifeſtation of the Knowledge of God <hi>in them,</hi> which is indeed the Goſpel preached in Man, <hi>that the</hi> Righteouſneſs of God <hi>is revealed from Faith to Faith</hi>; that is, it reveals to the Soul that which is Juſt, Good and Righteous; and that, as the Soul receiveth it, and believes, Righteouſneſs comes more and more to be revealed, from one degree of Faith to another. For tho' (as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſe ſaith) the outward Creation declares the Power of God; yet <hi>that which may be known of him, is manifeſt within:</hi> By which Inward Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, we are made capable to ſee and diſcern the Eternal Power and Godhead in the outward Creation; ſo, were it not for this <hi>Inward Principle,</hi> we could no more underſtand the Inviſible Things of God, by the outward viſible Creation, than a Blind Man can ſee and diſcern the variety of Shapes and Colours, or judge of the Beauty of the outward

Therefore he ſaith Firſt, <hi>That which may be known of God, is manifest in them</hi>; and in and by that, they may read and underſtand the Power and Godhead in thoſe things that are outward and viſible. And tho' any might pretend, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Creation doth, of it ſelf, without any Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural or Saving Principle in the Heart, even declare to the Natural Man, that there is a God; yet what would ſuch a Knowledge avail, if it did not alſo communicate to me what the Will of God is,<note place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may beget a Perſwaſion in Man of an Eternal Power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereas thoſe Gentiles, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, knew by that <hi>inward Law,</hi> and Manifeſtation of the Knowledge of God in them, to diſtinguiſh betwixt Good and Evil, as in the next Chapter appears, of which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter.

                  <p>But to thoſe Arguments, by which it hath been proved, <hi>That all Men have a Meaſure of ſaving Grace,</hi> I ſhall add one, and that very obſervable, not yet mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> that excellent Saying of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 2. v. 11. <hi>The Grace of God, that brings</hi> Salvation, <hi>hath appeared to all Men; teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that denying Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, we ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godlily in this preſent World</hi>: Than which, there can be nothing more clear, it comprehending both the parts of the Controverſie. Firſt; it teſtifies, that it is no Natural Principle or Light, but ſaith plainly, <hi>It brings Salvation.</hi> Secondly; it ſays not, that it hath appeared to a <hi>Few,</hi> but <hi>unto All Men.</hi> The Fruit of it declares alſo how Efficacious it is, ſeeing it comprehends the whole Duty of Man:<note place="margin">The Saving Grace of God, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Duty of Man.</note> It both teacheth us, firſt, to forſake Evil, to deny Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Worldly Luſts; and then it teacheth us our whole Duty. Firſt, to live <hi>Soberly</hi>; that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends Temperance, Chaſtity, Meekneſs, and thoſe things that relate unto a Man's ſelf. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Righteouſly</hi>; that comprehends Equity, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Honeſty, and thoſe things which relate to our Neighbours. And Laſtly, <hi>Godlily</hi>; which comprehends Piety, Faithfulneſs and Devotion; which are the Duties relating to God. So then there is nothing required of Man, or is needful to Man, which this Grace teacheth not. Yet I have heard a publick Preacher, (one of thoſe that are accounted Zealous Men) to evite the ſtrength of this Text, deny this Grace to be Saving, and ſay; <hi>It was only intended of common Favours and Graces, ſuch as is the Heat of the</hi> Fire, <hi>and outward Light of the</hi> Sun. Such is the Darkneſs and Ignorance of thoſe that oppoſe the Truth; whereas the Text ſaith expreſly,

But we have no reaſon to be ſtaggered by their denying, ſo long as our Faith is found in expreſs terms of the Scripture; they may as well ſeek to perſwade us, that we do not intend that which we affirm (tho' we know the contrary) as make us believe, that when the Apoſtle ſpeaks forth our Doctrine in plain words, yet he intends theirs, which is the quite contrary. And indeed, can there be any thing more abſurd, than to ſay, Where the word is plainly (<hi>All) Few</hi> is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended?

How many are injured by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, that know nothing of ever there being ſuch a Man in the World, or of his eating the Forbidden Fruit? Why may they not then be ſaved by the Gift and Grace of Chriſt in them, making them Righteous and Holy, tho' they know not diſtinctly how that was purchaſed unto them by the death and Sufferings of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that was Crucified at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>; eſpecially ſeeing God hath made that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſimply impoſſible to them? As many Men are killed, by Poiſon infuſed into their Meat, tho' they neither know what the Poiſon was, nor who infuſed it: So alſo on the other hand, how many are cured of their Diſeaſes, by good Remedies, who know not how the Medicine is prepared, what the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients are, nor oftentimes who made it?

Whatever then the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may pretend, or even ſome good Men among them may have thought. Experience ſheweth, and it is more than manifeſt, by the univerſal and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Practice of their People, that they place not their <hi>Juſtification</hi> ſo much in Works that are truly and morally Good, and in the being truly renewed and ſanctified in the Mind, as in ſuch things as are either nor Good nor Evil, or may truly be called Evil, and can no otherways be reckoned Good, than becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> pleaſes to call them ſo.<note place="margin">

So that this Act of Submiſſion and Faith to the Laws of the Church, and not any real inward Change, is that which juſtifieth him.

                  <note place="margin">Papiſts <hi>Pennance.</hi>
                  </note> ſo as to tell over his Sins to a Prieſt, tho' he have not true <hi>Contrition</hi> (which the Lord hath made abſolutely neceſſary for Penitent Sinners) but only <hi>Attrition,</hi> a Figment of their own) that is, If he be ſorry he hath ſinned, not out of any love to God, or his Law, which he hath tranſgreſſed, but for fear of Puniſhment; yet doth the Vertue of the Sacrament (as they affirm) procure to him Remiſſion of Sins; ſo that being abſolved by the

As for Example:
<q>He that in the great <hi>Jubilee,</hi> will go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and preſent himſelf before the Gate of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and there receive the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Bleſſing</hi>; or he that will go a Pilgrimage to <hi>James</hi>'s Sepulchre in <hi>Spain,</hi> or to <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Loretto,</hi> is upon the performance of thoſe things promiſed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sin. Now if we ask them the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon how ſuch things, as are not morally good in themſelves, come to have Vertue? They have no other anſwer, but <hi>becauſe of the Church's and Pope</hi>'s <hi>Authority</hi>; who being the great Treaſurer of the Magazine of <hi>Chriſt's Merits,</hi> lets them out upon ſuch and ſuch Conditions. Thus alſo the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſaying <hi>Maſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Papiſts-Maſs, what it is?</note> is made a chief Inſtrument of <hi>Juſtification</hi>; for in it they pretend to offer <hi>Chriſt</hi> daily to the Father, a <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> for the Sins of the Living and Dead: So that a Man, for Money, can procure <hi>Christ</hi> thus to be offer'd for him when he pleaſes: by which Offering he is ſaid to obtain Remiſſion of Sins, and to ſtand Juſtified in the ſight of God. From all which, and much more of this nature which might be mentioned, it doth appear, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> place their Juſtification,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:003129_0107_0FF004E6DEB91CC0"/>
not ſo much in any Work of Holineſs, really brought forth in them, and real forſaking of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as in the meer Performance of ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and a blind Belief which their Teachers have begotten in them; that the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> having the abſolute Diſpenſation of the <hi>Merits of Chriſt,</hi> have power to make theſe Merits effectual for the Remiſſion of Sins, and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch, as will perform thoſe Ceremonies.</q>
This is the true and real method of Juſtification, taken by the generality of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and highly commended by their publick Preachers, eſpecially the <hi>Monks,</hi> in their Sermons to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; of which I my ſelf have been an Ear and an Eye-witneſs: However ſome of their modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have laboured to qualifie it in their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>even as wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt</hi>; for they, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, are rather an effect of Juſtification than the Cauſe of it:<note place="margin">The Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt in us begets good Works.</note> But we underſtand the <hi>Formation of Chriſt in us, Chriſt born and brought forth in us</hi>; from which, Good Works as naturally proceed, as Fruit from a fruitful Tree.

For Chriſt maketh not Interceſſion for thoſe, that are not in a Poſſibility of Salvation; that is abſurd. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries will not admit that he prayed for the World at all; and to pray for thoſe, that are already Reconciled, and perfectly Juſtified, is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: To pray for Remiſſion of Sins, is yet more needleſs, if all be remitted, paſt, preſent, and to come. Indeed there is not any ſolid Solving of this, but by acknowledging, according to the <hi>Truth,</hi> That Chriſt by his Death removed the Wrath of God, ſo far as to obtain Remiſſion of Sins for as many as receive that <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates unto them, and hath purchaſed for them by his Blood: Which, as they believe in, they come to know Remiſſion of Sins paſt, and Power to ſave them from Sin, and to wipe it away, ſo often as they may fall into it by unwatchfulneſs or weakneſs, if applying themſelves to this Grace, they truly Repent. For <hi>to as many as receive him,
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:003129_0113_0FF004F766EA14F8"/>
he gives Power to become the Sons of God</hi>: So none are Sons, none are Juſtified, none Reconciled, until they thus receive him in that little <hi>Seed</hi> in their Hearts: <hi>And Life Eternal is offered to thoſe, who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for Glory, Honour, and Immortality: For if the Righteous Man depart from his Righteouſneſs, his Righteouſneſs ſhall be remembred no more.</hi> And therefore, on the other part, none are longer Sons of God, and Juſtified, than they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently continue in Righteouſneſs and Well doing. And therefore Chriſt lives always making Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, during the Day of every Man's Viſitation, that they may be Converted And when Men are in ſome meaſure Converted, he makes Interceſſion, that they may continue, and go on, and not faint, nor go back again.

For indeed, if this Argument hold, it might be ſtretched to that length, as to become very pleaſing to wicked Men, that love to abide in their Sins: For if we be made <hi>Righteous, as Chriſt was made a</hi> Sinner, <hi>meerly by imputation, then as there was no</hi> Sin, <hi>not in the leaſt in Chriſt</hi>; ſo it would follow, <hi>that there needed no more</hi> Righteouſneſs, <hi>no more</hi> Holineſs, <hi>no more inward</hi> Sactification <hi>in us, than there was</hi> Sin <hi>in him.</hi> So then by his (<hi>being made</hi> Sin <hi>for us)</hi> muſt be underſtood, his Suffering for our Sins, that we might be made Partakers of the Grace purchaſed by him; by the Workings whereof we are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him. For that the Apoſtle underſtood here a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made really Righteous, and not meerly a being reputed ſuch, appears by what follows, ſeeing in <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16. of the following Chapter, he argues largely againſt any ſuppoſed <hi>Agreement of Light and Darkneſs, Righteouſneſs and Unrighteouſneſs</hi>; which muſt needs be admitted, if Men are to be reckon'd Ingrafted in Chriſt, and real Members of him, meerly by an Imputative Righteouſneſs, wholly without them, while they themſelves are actually Unrighteous. And indeed, it may be thought ſtrange, how ſome Men have made this ſo Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental an Article of their Faith, which is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole ſtrain of the Goſpel: A thing, Chriſt in none of all his Sermons and Gracious Speeches ever willed any to rely upon; always recommending to us Works, as Inſtrumental in our Juſtification. And the more 'tis to be admired at, becauſe that Sentence or Term (ſo frequently in their Mouths,

                  </note> the want of Chriſt thus revealed and known in the Soul: Whereby it neceſſarily follows, by the Rule of Contraries, where the Party is alike (as in this caſe it is evident) that, where Chriſt is inwardly known, there the Perſons ſubjected to him are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and Juſtified. For there can be nothing more plain than this, That if we muſt know <hi>Chriſt in us,</hi> except we be Reprobates, or unjuſtified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; if we know him <hi>in us,</hi> we are not Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and conſequently Juſtified Ones.

<pb n="226" facs="unknown:003129_0120_0FF0050ACEC65940"/>
the Original and Fundamental Cauſe of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is, the Love of God manifeſted in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Jeſus Chriſt in the Fleſh; who by his Life,<note place="margin">Chriſt by his Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings has open'd a way for our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</note> Death, Sufferings and Obedience, made a way for our Reconciliation, and became a Sacrifice for the Remiſſion of Sins that are paſt, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed unto us this Seed and Grace, from which this Birth ariſes, and in which Jeſus Chriſt is inwardly received, formed, and brought forth in us, in his own pure and holy Image of Righteouſneſs; by which our Souls live unto God, and are clothed with him, and have put him on, even as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. We ſtand Juſtified and Saved in and by him, and by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7. So again, <hi>Reciprocally,</hi> we are hereby made partakers of the fulneſs of his Merits and his cleanſing Blood is near, to waſh away every Sin and Infirmity, and to heal all our Backſlidings, as often as we turn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him by unfeigned Repentance, and become renewed by the Spirit. Thoſe then, that find him thus raiſed, and ruling in them, have a true ground of Hope to beleive that they are juſtified by his Blood. But let not any deceive themſelves, ſo as to foſter themſelves in a vain Hope and Confidence; that by the Death and ſufferings of Chriſt they are Juſtified, ſo long as <hi>Sin lies at their door,</hi> Gen. 4.7. Iniquity prevails, and they remain yet unrenewed and unregenerate; leſt it be ſaid unto them, <hi>I know you not.</hi> Let that ſaying of Chriſt be remember'd, <hi>Not every one, that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter, but he that doth the Will of my Father,</hi> Mat. 7.21. To which let theſe Excellent Sayings of the Beloved Diſciple be added; <hi>Little Children, let no Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, he that doth Righteouſneſs is Righteous, even as he is Righteous.

               <p>Many famous Proteſtants bear witneſs to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Juſtification by Chriſt, inwardly revealed and formed in Man. As, 1. <hi>M. Borhaeus</hi>:<note place="margin">Borhaeus <hi>in</hi> Gen. <hi>p.</hi> 162.</note>
                  <q>In the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation (ſaith he) wherein Chriſt is aſcribed and imputed to Believers for Righteouſneſs, the Merit of his Blood, and the Holy Ghoſt given unto us by Vertue of his Merits,<note place="margin">The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Famous Proteſtants of Inward Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> are equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. And ſo it ſhall be confeſſed, <hi>That Chriſt is our Righteouſneſs,</hi> as well from his Merit, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and Remiſſion of Sins obtained by him, as from the Gifts of the Spirit of Righteouſneſs. And if we do this, we ſhall conſider the whole Chriſt, propoſed to us for our Salvation, and not any ſingle part of him. The ſame Man, p. 169. In our Juſtification then Chriſt is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who breathes and lives in us, to wit, by his Spirit put on by us; concerning which putting on, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Ye have put on Christ.</hi> And again, p. 171. We endeavour to treat in Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, not of part of Chriſt, but him wholly, in ſo far as he is our Righteouſneſs every way.</q>
And a little after:
<q>As then bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> in our Juſtification, when he ſaith, <hi>Whom he Juſtified, them he Glorified,</hi> comprehends all things which pertains to our being Reconciled to God the Father, and our Renewing, which fits us for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unto Glory, ſuch as Faith, Righteouſneſs, Chriſt, and the Gift of Righteouſneſs Exhibited by him, whereby we are Regenerated, to the fulfilling of the Juſtification which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: So we alſo will have all things compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this cauſe, which are contained in the recovery of Righteouſneſs and Innocency. And p. 181.</q>
                  <q>The Form (ſaith he) of our Juſtification is the Divine Righteouſneſs it ſelf, by which we are formed Juſt and Good. This is Jeſus Chriſt, who is eſteem'd our Righteouſneſs, partly from the forgiveneſs of Sins, and partly from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and the reſtoring of that Integrity, which
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:003129_0121_0FF0050C6808A458"/>

The firſt are excluded, the ſecond not, but are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The firſt are thoſe, which are performed in Man's own Will, and by his Strength, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the outward Law and Letter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are Man's own imperfect Work, or Works of the Law, which <hi>makes nothing perfect</hi>: And to this belong all the Ceremonies, Purifications, Waſhings, and Traditions of the Jews. The ſecond are the Works of the Spirit of Grace in the Heart, wrought in conformity to the Inward and Spiritual Law; which Works are not wrought in Man's Will, nor by his Power and Ability, but in and by the Power and Spirit of Chriſt <hi>in us,</hi> and therefore are pure and perfect in their kind (as ſhall hereafter be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) and may be called Chriſt's Works, for that he is the immediate Author and Worker of them: Such Works we affirm abſolutely neceſſary to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſo that a Man cannot be Juſtified without them; and all Faith without them is dead and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith. Now, that ſuch a diſtinction is to be admitted, and that the Works ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Apoſtle, in the matter of Juſtification, are of the firſt kind, will appear, if we conſider the occaſion of the Apoſtle's mentioning this, as well here, as throughout in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>

where he ſpeaks of this matter, and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at large: Which was this, That whereas many of the Gentiles, that were not of the Race or Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as concerning the Fleſh, were come to be Converted to the Chriſtian Faith, and believe in him, ſome of thoſe that were of the Jewiſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, thought to ſubject the Faithful and Believing Gentiles to the legal Ceremonies and Obſervations, as neceſſary to their Juſtification: This gave the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> occaſion at length,<note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Apoſtle's ſpeaking of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And that the Works excluded by the Apoſtle are of this kind of Works of the Law, appears by the ſtrain of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4. For after (in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.) he upbraideth them for their returning unto the Obſervation of <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and that (in the beginning of <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.) he ſheweth them their Folly, and the Evil Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of adhering to the Ceremonies of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; then he adds, v. 6. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion nor Uncircumciſion availeth; but Faith, which worketh by love</hi>; and thus he concludes again, chap. 6. v. 15. <hi>For in Christ Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth, nor Uncircumciſion, but a new Creatre.</hi> From which places appeareth that diſtinction of Works before mentioned, whereof the one is excluded, the other neceſſary to Juſtification. For the Apoſtle ſheweth here, that Circumciſion (which word is often uſed to comprehend the whole Ceremonies and Legal Performances of the Jews,) is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, nor doth avail. Here are then the Works which are excluded, by which no Man is Juſtified; but Faith, which <hi>worketh by love,</hi> but the <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> this is that which availeth, which is abſolutely

That <hi>for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil; and ye know that he was manifeſted to take away our ſins.</hi> But theſe Men make this purpoſe of none effect; for they will not have the Son of God to <hi>deſtroy the Works of the Devil in his Children,</hi> in this World: Neither will they at all believe, that he

And how injurious are they to the Efficacy and Power of Chriſt's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance?

How comes it then, that the Servants of Chriſt are leſs his Servants, than the Devil's are his? Or is Chriſt unwilling to have his Servants throughly pure? Which were groſs Blaſphemy to aſſert, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to many Scriptures. Or is he not able, by his Power to preſerve and enable his Children to ſerve him? Which were no leſs Blaſphemous to affirm of him; concerning whom the Scriptures declare, That he has <hi>Overcome</hi> Sin, Death, Hell, <hi>and the</hi> Grave, <hi>and Triumphed over them openly; and
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:003129_0131_0FF0052818B4C4A0"/>
that All Power in Heaven and Earth is given to him.</hi> But certainly, if the Saints ſin daily in Thought, Word and Deed, as theſe Men aſſert, they ſerve the Devil daily, and are ſubject to his Power; and ſo he prevails more than Chriſt doth, and holds the Servants of Chriſt in bondage, whether Chriſt will or not. But how greatly then doth it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the End of Chriſt's coming, as it is expreſſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. <hi>Even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water, by the Word: That he might preſent it to himſelf a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> or any ſuch thing; <hi>but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh.</hi> Now if Chriſt hath really thus anſwered the thing he came for, then the Members of this Church are not always finning in Thought, Word and Deed; or there is no difference betwixt being Sanctified and Unſanctified, Clean and Unclean, Holy and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, being daily Blemiſhed with Sin, and being without Blemiſh.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly</hi>; Seeing the contrary Doctrine is built upon this falſe <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That <hi>Grace is not given for</hi> Salvation <hi>to any, but to a certain</hi> Elect Number, <hi>which cannot loſe it; and that all the reſt of Mankind, by an</hi> abſolute Decree, <hi>are debarred from Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; that being deſtroy'd, this falls to the Ground. Now as that Doctrine of theirs is wholly inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the daily Practice of thoſe that preach it; in that they exhort People to believe and be ſaved, while in the mean Time, if they belong to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation, it is ſimply impoſſible for them ſo to do; and if to the Decree of Election, it is needleſs: Seeing it is as impoſſible to them to miſs of

it, as hath been before demonſtrated. So alſo in this matter of Perſeverance, their Practice and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are no leſs inconſiſtent and contradictory. For while they daily exhort People to be Faithful to the end, ſhewing them, if they continue not, they ſhall be cut-off, and fall ſhort of the Reward; which is very true: But no leſs inconſiſtent with that Doctrine, that affirms, <hi>There is no hazard, becauſe no poſſibility of departing from the leaſt meaſure of true Grace:</hi> Which if true, it is to no purpoſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech them to <hi>ſtand,</hi> to whom God hath made it impoſſible to <hi>fall.</hi> I ſhall not longer inſiſt upon the Probation of this; ſeeing what is ſaid, may ſuffice to anſwer my deſign; and that the thing is alſo abundantly proved by many of the ſame Judgment. That this was the Doctrine of the Primitive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, thence appears, that the <hi>Auguſtane Confeſſion</hi> condemns it as an Error of the <hi>Anababtiſts,</hi> to ſay, <hi>That who once are Juſtified, they cannot loſe the Holy Spirit</hi>: Many ſuch like Sayings are to be found in the common places of <hi>Philip Melancthon.</hi>

which alſo, becauſe largely treated of by others, I omit; to come to that Teſtimony of the Truth, which is more eſpecially ours in this matter, and is contained in the latter part of the Propoſition, in theſe words; <hi>Yet ſuch an increaſe and ſtability in the Truth may in this Life be attained, from which there cannot be a total Apoſtaſie.</hi>

And even as in the former Controverſie was obſerved, ſo alſo in this, the defence of Truth will readily appear to ſuch as ſerouſly weigh the matter: For the Arguments upon both hands, rightly applied, will as to this hold good; and the Objections, which are ſtrong, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively urged againſt the two oppoſite falſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, are here eaſily ſolved, by the eſtabliſhing of this Truth. For all the Arguments, which theſe alledge that affirm, <hi>There can be no falling away,</hi> may well be received upon the one part, as of thoſe who have attained to this Stability and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and their Objections ſolved by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; ſo upon the other hand, the Arguments alledged from Scripture-Teſtimonies, by thoſe that

Thus then the contrary Batterings of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, who miſs the Truth, do concur the more ſtrongly to eſtabliſh it, while they are deſtroying each other. But leſt this may not ſeem to ſuffice to ſatisfie ſuch as judge it always <hi>poſſible for the beſt of Men, before they die, to fall away</hi>; I ſhall add, for the proof of it, ſome brief Conſiderations, from ſome few Teſtimonies of the Scripture.</p>

For ſince the <hi>Wages of Sin is Death,</hi> there is no Man, while he ſinneth, and is ſubject thereunto, but may lawfully ſuppoſe himſelf capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of periſhing: Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>But I keep under my Body, and bring it into</hi> ſubjection; <hi>leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth it poſſible for him to be <hi>a cast-away</hi>; and yet it may be judged, he was far more advanced in the Inward Work of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when he wrote that Epiſtle, than many who now a-days too preſumptuouſly ſuppoſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall away; becauſe they feel themſelves to have attained ſome ſmall degree of true Grace. But the Apoſtle makes uſe of this Suppoſition, or Poſſibility of his being <hi>a Caſt-away</hi> (as I before obſerved) as an Inducement to him to be Watchful; <hi>I keep under my Body, laſt,</hi> &amp;c.

another time, in the ſenſe and feeling of God's Holy Power, and in the Dominion thereof, finding himſelf a Conqueror there through over Sin and his Soul's Enemies, maketh no difficulty to affirm, Rom. 8.38. <hi>For I am perſwaded, that neither Death nor Life,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>II.</hi> A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in this life, from which there is no falling away.</note> It appears ſuch a Condition is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, becauſe we are Exhorted to it; and, as hath been proved before, the Scripture never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to us things impoſſible. Such an Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have from the Apoſtle, 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rather, Bretheren, give diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi> And tho' there be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition here propoſed; yet ſince we have already proved, that it is poſſible to fulfil this Condition, then alſo the Promiſe annexed thereunto may be attained. And ſince, where Aſſurance is wanting, there is ſtill a place left for doubtings and deſpairs; if we would affirm it never attainable, then ſhould there never be a place known by the Saints in this World, wherein they might be free of doubting and deſpair: Which as it is moſt abſurd in it ſelf, ſo it is contrary to the manifeſt Experience of Thouſands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi>; God hath given to many of his Saints and Children, and is ready to give unto <hi>All,</hi>

But this Aſſurance would be no Aſſurance, if thoſe, who are ſo <hi>Aſſured,</hi> were not <hi>Establiſhed</hi> and <hi>Confirmed,</hi> beyond all doubt and heſitation: If ſo, then ſurely there is no poſſibility for ſuch to miſs of that which God hath aſſured them of.

Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome that are <hi>ſealed,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.22. <hi>Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the Earneſt of the</hi> Spirit <hi>in our Hearts:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit ſo ſealing, is called the <hi>Earneſt</hi> or <hi>Pledge of our inheritance,</hi> Eph. 1.13. <hi>In whom ye were ſealed by the</hi> Holy Spirit <hi>of Promiſe.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> not only in that of the <hi>Romans</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted, declareth himſelf to have attained that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. he affirmeth in theſe words, <hi>I have fought a good Fight,</hi> &amp;c. which alſo many good Men have and do witneſs. And therefore, as there can be nothing more manifeſt, than that which the <hi>manifeſt Experience</hi> of this Time ſheweth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is found agreeable to the Experience of former Times; ſo we ſee, there have been both of <hi>old</hi> and of <hi>late,</hi> that have <hi>turned the</hi> Grace of God into <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs,</hi> and have <hi>fallen from their Faith and Integrity</hi>; thence we may ſafely conclude ſuch a falling away poſſible.

He took not the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> that he might ſuffer them to fall into the old Errors of the <hi>Jews</hi>; or to approve them in their Errors: But that he might gather unto himſelf a pure People out of the Earth.<note place="margin">The <hi>Jews</hi> of Error of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s outward Succeſſion.</note> Now this was the great Error of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to think they were the Church and People of God, becauſe they could derive their outward Succeſſion from <hi>Abraham</hi>; whereby they reckoned themſelves the Children of God, as being the Off-ſpring of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was the <hi>Father of the Faithful.</hi> But how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely doth the Scripture rebuke this vain and frivolous Pretence?

And that every true Member doth thus receive Nouriſhment and Life from the <hi>Head,</hi> the Apoſtle expreſly affirmeth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. <hi>From whom the whole Body being fitly joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and compacted by that which every joynt ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, according to the effectual working in the meaſure of every part, makes increaſe of the Body, unto the Edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſelf in Love.</hi> Now this that thus is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and which thus uniteth the whole, is no other than the Grace of God; and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the ſame Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. ſaith, <hi>But unto every one of us is given</hi> Grace <hi>according to the meaſure of the Gift of Christ</hi>; and verſ. 11. he ſheweth how that <hi>by this</hi> Grace <hi>and</hi> Gift, <hi>both Apoſtles, Prophets, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, Paſtors and Teachers, are given for the Work of the Miniſtry, and Edifying of the Body of Christ.</hi> And certainly then, no Man deſtitute of Grace, is fit for this Work, ſeeing that all that Chriſt gives, are ſo <hi>qualified</hi>; and theſe that are not ſo <hi>qualified,</hi> are not given, nor ſent of Chriſt; are not to be heard nor received, nor acknowledged as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel; becauſe his <hi>Sheep</hi> neither ought,<note place="margin">The Sheep of Christ, neither ought nor will hear the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Voice.</note> nor will hear the <hi>Voice of a Stranger.</hi> This is alſo, clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. throughout; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in that Chapter, treating of the diverſity of Gifts, and Members of the Body, ſheweth how by

Then, if there be no true Member of the Body, which is not thus bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by this Spirit, neither any thing that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the edifying of it, but according to a Meaſure of Grace received from the Spirit; ſurely without Grace none ought to be admitted to work or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Body; becauſe their Labour and Work without this Grace and Spirit, would be but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</p>
               <p n="16">§.

                  </note> Overturning and Eſtabliſhing of Kingdoms. And the Hiſtories of late times are as full of the various Tragedies, acted upon the account of this Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy and Common-wealth, as the Hiſtories of old times, that gave account of the Wars and Conteſts, that fell out both in the <hi>Aſſyrian, Perſian, Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empires: Theſe laſt, upon this account, tho' among thoſe that are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> have been no leſs Bloody and Monſtrous, than the former among <hi>Heathens,</hi> concerning their outward Empires and Governments.

But in oppoſition to all this Maſs of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and heap of Orders, Rules and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we ſay, <hi>the Subſtance is chiefly to be ſought after, and the Power, Vertue and Spirit, is to be known and waited for,</hi> which is One in all the different Names and Offices the Scripture makes uſe of; as appears by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.

If a Man have ſeveral Children, he will allot one of them to be a Miniſter, which if he can get it to be, he reckons it as Good as a Patrimony; ſo that a ſet Benefice hath always a good many Expectants, and then what Bribing, what Courting, what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and ſhameful Actions, are uſed to acquire theſe things, is too openly known, and needs not to be proved.</p>

hypocritically pretend, at their accepting of, and entring into their Church, that they have nothing before them, but the Glory of God, and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls; yet if a richer Benefice offer it ſelf, they preſently find it more for God's Glory, to remove from the firſt, and go thither. And thus they make no difficulty often to change, while notwithſtanding they accuſe us, that we allow Miniſters to go from Place to Place, and not to be tied to one Place; but we allow this, not for the gaining of Money, but as moved of God. For if a Miniſter be called to miniſter in a particular Place, he ought not to leave it, except God call him from it, and then he ought to obey: For we make the Will of God <hi>inwardly revealed,</hi> and not the Love of Money, and more Gain, the Ground of removing.</p>

Now I come to ſpeak of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> or of thoſe Acts, whether private or publick, general or particular, whereby Man renders to God that part of his Duty, which relates immediately to him: And as <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice,</hi> ſo neither is any Sacrifice <hi>acceptable,</hi> but that which is done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Will of him, to whom it is <hi>offered.</hi> But Men, finding it eaſier to <hi>ſacrifice</hi> in their own Wills, than obey God's Will, have heaped up Sacrifices without Obedience; and thinking to deceive God, as they do one another, give him a ſhew of Reverence, Honour and Worſhip, while they are both inwardly eſtranged and alienated from his Holy and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life, and wholly ſtrangers to the pure Breathings of his Spirit, in which the acceptable Sacrifice and Worſhip is only offered up.<note place="margin">True Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Duty to God-warde corrupted.</note> Hence it is that there is not any thing relating to Man's Duty towards God, which among all ſorts of People hath been more vitiated, and in which the Devil hath more prevailed, than in abuſing Man's Mind concerning this thing: And as among many other, ſo among thoſe called Chriſtians, nothing hath been more out of order, and more corrupted, as ſome Papiſts, and all Proteſtants, do acknowledge. As I freely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove whatſoever the Proteſtants have Reformed from Papiſts in this reſpect; ſo I meddle not at this time with their Controveſies about it: Only it ſuffices me, with them, to deny, as no part of the true Worſhip of God, that abominable Superſtition and Idolatry, the <hi>Popiſh Maſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Popiſh Maſs (Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, with all their Trumpery.</note> the <hi>Adoration of Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>Veneration of Relicks,</hi> the <hi>Viſitation of Sepulchres,</hi> and all thoſe other Superſtitious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Confraternities, and endleſs Pilgrimages of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Synagogue.

betwixt them and us. For we find many of the Branches lopp'd off by them, but the Root yet remaining; to wit, a Worſhip acted in and from Man's Will and Spirit, and not by and from the Spirit of God: For the true Chriſtian and Spiritual Worſhip of God hath been ſo early loſt, and Man's Wiſdom and Will hath ſo quickly and throughly mixed it ſelf herein; that both the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> in this reſpect hath been greateſt, and the <hi>Reformation</hi> here-from, as to the Evil Root, moſt difficult. Therefore let not the Reader ſuddenly ſtumble at the account of our Propoſition in this matter; but hear us patiently in this reſpect Explain our ſelves, and I hope (by the aſſiſtance of God) to make it appear, that tho' our manner of Speaking and Doctrine ſeem moſt ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and different from all other ſorts of Chriſtians; yet it is moſt according to the pureſt Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and indeed moſt needful to be obſerved and followed. And that there be no ground of miſtake (for that I was neceſſitated to ſpeak in few words, and therefore more obſcurely and dubiouſly, in the Propoſition it ſelf) it is fit in the firſt place to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and hold forth our Senſe, and clear the State of the Controverſie.</p>

There is not any Exerciſe whatſoever, wherein he cannot enter, and have a chief place, ſo as the Soul many times cannot diſcern it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in this alone: For he can only work in and by the Natural Man, and his Faculties, by ſecretly acting upon his Imagnations and Deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore, when he (to wit, the Natural Man) is ſilent, there he muſt alſo ſtand. And therefore when the Soul comes to this <hi>Silence,</hi> and as it were is brought to nothingneſs as to her own work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, then the Devil is ſhut out; for the pure Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and ſhining of his Light he cannot abide, becauſe ſo long as a Man is thinking and meditating as of himſelf, he cannot be ſure, but the Devil is influencing him therein; but when he comes wholly to be ſilent, as the <hi>pure Light</hi> of God ſhines in upon him, then he is ſure that the Devil is ſhut out; for beyond the Imaginations he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go, which we often find by ſenſible Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

This Teſtimony is the more eſpecially to be obſerved, for that it is both the <hi>firſt, chiefeſt,</hi> and <hi>moſt ample Testimony,</hi> which Chriſt gives us of his Chriſtian Worſhip, as different and contra diſtinguiſhed from that under the Law. For Firſt, he ſheweth, that the Seaſon is now come, wherein the <hi>Worſhip muſt be in</hi> Spirit &amp; in Truth; <hi>for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him:</hi> So then it is no more a Worſhip conſiſting in <hi>outward Obſervations,</hi> to be performed by Man at <hi>ſet Times</hi> or <hi>Opportunities,</hi> which he can do in his own Will, and by his own Natural Strength; for elſe it would not differ in <hi>Matter,</hi> but only in ſome <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> from that under the Law. Next,<note place="margin">The Reaſon Chriſt gives for a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> as for a Reaſon of this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we need not to give any other, and indeed none can give a better, than that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> giveth, which I think ſhould be ſufficient to ſatisfie every Chriſtian, to wit, GOD <hi>is a</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in</hi> Spirit &amp; in Truth. As this ought to be received, becauſe it is the words of Chriſt, ſo alſo it is founded upon ſo clear a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:003129_0196_0FF005BD7A8EB130"/>
of Reaſon, as ſufficiently evidenceth its <hi>Verity.</hi> For Chriſt excellently argues from the <hi>Analogy</hi> that ought to be betwixt the <hi>Object,</hi> and the <hi>Worſhip</hi> directed thereunto:</p>
               <p>
                  <list type="syllogism">
                     <head>Arg.</head>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſo certain, that it can ſuffer no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; yea, and this Analogy is ſo neceſſary to be minded, that under the Law, when God inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and appointed that Ceremonial Worſhip to the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe that Worſhip was Outward, that there might be an <hi>Analogy</hi>; he ſaw it neceſſary to Condeſcend to them as in a ſpecial manner, to dwell betwixt the Cherubims within the Tabernacle, and afterwards to make the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in a ſort his habitation,<note place="margin">The Glory of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> and cauſe ſomething of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Glory and Majeſty to appear, by cauſing Fire from Heaven to conſume the Sacrifices, and filling the Temple with a cloud: Through and by which <hi>Mediums,</hi> Viſible to the outward Eye, he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelf proportionably to that Outward Worſhip, which he had Commanded them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.

Since, as Chriſt argueth, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> he will now be worſhiped in the Spirit, where he reveals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and dwelleth with the <hi>contrite in heart.</hi> Now, ſince it is the Heart of Man that now is become the Temple of God, in which he will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and no more in particular outward Temples, (ſince as bleſſed <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid, out of the Prophet, to the Profeſſing <hi>Jews</hi> of Old, <hi>The Moſt High dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not in Temples made with hands</hi>) as before the <hi>Glory of the Lord</hi> deſcended to fill the outward Temple, it behoved to be purified and cleanſed and all polluted ſtuff removed out of it; yea, and the place for the Tabernacle was overlaid with Gold, the moſt precious, clean, and cleareſt of Metals: So alſo before God be worſhipped in the inward Temple of the Heart, it muſt alſo be purified of its own Filth, and all its own Thoughts and Imaginations, that ſo it may be fit to receive the Spirit of God, and to be acted by it. And doth not this directly lead us to that inward Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, of which we have ſpoken, and exactly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out? And further, This Worſhip muſt be <hi>in Truth</hi>; intimating, that this Spiritual Worſhip, thus acted, is only and properly a true Worſhip; as being that which, for the Reaſons above ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, cannot be counterfeited by the Enemy, nor yet performed by the Hypocrite.</p>

But what is this to their cuſtomary conned way, without either waiting for, or expecting the Movings or Leadings of the Spirit? Moreover, that neither Chriſt nor <hi>Peter</hi> did it as a ſettled cuſtom or Form, to be conſtantly practiſed by all the Miniſters of the Church, appears, in that moſt of all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons recorded of Chriſt and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were without this; as appears, from Chriſt's Sermon upon the mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.1, &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.1, &amp;c. and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and to the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp;c. As then it appears, that this method of preaching is not grounded upon any Scripture-Precept; ſo the nature of it is contrary to the Preaching of Chriſt under the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> as expreſt and recommended in Scripture. For Chriſt in ſending forth his Diſciples, expreſly mentioneth, that they are not to ſpeak <hi>of</hi> or <hi>from</hi> themſelves, or to fore-caſt before hand; but that which the Spirit <hi>in the ſame hour ſhall teach them</hi>; as is particularly mentioned in the Three Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.11. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.12. Now if Chriſt gave this Order to his Diſciples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he departed from them, as that which they were to practiſe, during his abode outwardly with them; much more were they to do it after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, ſince then they were more eſpecially to receive the Spirit, to <hi>lead them in all things,</hi> and to <hi>bring all things to their remembrance,</hi> John 14.26. And if they were to do ſo, when they appeared before the Magiſtrates and Princes of the Earth, much more in the Worſhip of God, when they ſtand ſpecially before him; ſeeing, as is above ſhewn, his Worſhip is to be performed in Spirit: And therefore, after their receiving of the Holy

But this Preaching, not being done by the Actings and Movings of God's Spirit, but by Man's Invention and Eloquence, in his own Will, and through his natural and acquired Parts and Learning, is in the Wiſdom of Words; and therefore the <hi>Croſs of Christ</hi> is thereby made of none Effect. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Speech &amp; Preaching was not <hi>with enticing Words of Man's Wiſdom, but in Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power</hi>; That the Faith of their Hearers <hi>ſhould not ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.3, 4, 5. But this Preaching having nothing of the Spirit and Power in it, both the Preachers and Hearers confeſſing they wait for no ſuch thing, nor yet are often-times ſenſible of it, muſt needs ſtand in the enticing words of Man's Wiſdom; ſince it is by the meer Wiſdom of Man it is ſought after, and the meer Strength of Man's Eloquence and enticing Words, it is uttered; and therefore no wonder, if the Faith of ſuch as hear and depend upon ſuch Preachers and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, and not in the
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:003129_0202_0FEFD75947466D40"/>
Power of God. The Apoſtles declared, That they <hi>ſpake not in the words which</hi> Man's Wiſdom <hi>teacheth, but which the</hi> Holy Ghoſt <hi>teacheth,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.13. But theſe Preachers confeſs, that they are ſtrangers to the Holy Ghoſt, his Motions and Operations, neither do they wait to feel them; and therefore they ſpeak in the words, which their own natural Wiſdom and Learning teach them, mixing them in, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to ſuch words, as they ſteal out of the Scripture, and other Books; and therefore ſpeak not what the Holy Ghoſt teacheth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is contrary to the Method and Order of the Primitive Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> True Church's Method was to ſpeak by Revelation</note> mentioned by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where in <hi>Preaching</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is to wait for his <hi>Revelation,</hi> and to give place one unto another, according as things are revealed. But here there is no waiting for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> but the Preacher muſt ſpeak, and not that which is revealed unto him, but what he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and premeditated before-hand.</p>

                  <hi>Lastly</hi>; By this kind of Preaching, the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">

Yea, according to this Doctrine, the Devil may preach, and ought to be heard alſo; ſeeing he both knoweth the Truth, and hath as much Eloquence as any. But what avails Excellency of Speech, if the Demonſtration and Power of the Spirit be wanting, which toucheth the Conſcience? We ſee, that when the Devil confeſſed to the Truth, yet Chriſt would have none of his Teſtimony. And as theſe pregnant Teſtimonies of the Scripture, do prove this part of Preaching to be contrary

But beſides, it hath often-times fallen out, that God, having a regard to the Simplicity and Integrity either of the Preacher or Hearers, hath fallen in upon the Heart of a Preacher by his Power and Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and thereby hath led him to ſpeak things which were not in his Premeditated Diſcourſe, and which perhaps he never thought of before: And thoſe paſſing Ejaculations and Unpremedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but Living Exhortations, have proved more Beneficial and Refreſhful both to Preacher and Hearers, than all their premeditated Sermons. But all that will not allow them to continue in theſe things, which in themſelves are not approved; but contrary to the Practice of the Apoſtles, when God is raiſing up a People to ſerve him, according to the Primitive Purity and Spirituality; yea, ſuch Acts of God's Condeſenſion, in times of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ignorance ſhould engage all more and more to follow him, according as he reveals his moſt <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Way.</hi>

Having hitherto ſpoken of <hi>Preaching</hi>; now it is fit to ſpeak of <hi>Praying,</hi> concerning which the like Controverſie ariſeth. Our Adverſaries, whoſe <hi>Religion</hi> is all for the moſt part <hi>outſide,</hi> and ſuch whoſe Acts are the meer product of Man's natural Will and Abilities; as they can Preach, ſo can they Pray when they pleaſe, and therefore have their ſet particular Prayers. I meddle not with the Controverſies among themſelves concerning this; ſome of them being for <hi>ſet Prayers,</hi> as a <hi>Liturgy</hi>; others for ſuch as are conceived <hi>extempore</hi>: It ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices me, that all of them agree in this, That the Motions and Influence of the Spirit of God, are not neceſſary to be previous thereunto;<note place="margin">The <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſet times to Preach and Pray, deny the Spirit.</note> and therefore they have <hi>ſet times</hi> in their publick Worſhip, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after Preaching, and in their private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as Morning and Evening, and before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meat, and other ſuch occaſions; at which they preciſely ſet about the performing of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by ſpeaking words to God, whether they feel any Motion or Influence of the Spirit, or not: So that ſome of the chiefeſt have confeſſed, that they have thus prayed, without the Motions and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit, acknowledging, that they ſinned in ſo doing; yet they ſaid, they look'd upon it as their Duty to do ſo, tho' to pray without the Spirit be ſin. We freely confeſs, that <hi>Prayer</hi> is both very profitable, and a neceſſary Duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and fit to be practiſed frequently by all Chriſtians: But as we can do nothing without Chriſt, ſo neither can we Pray, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and Aſſiſtance of his Spirit. But, that the State of the Controverſie may be the better underſtood, let it be conſidered, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Prayer</hi> is twofold,<note place="margin">What In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> is?</note>

and Miſery, it looks up to God; and joining iſſue with the ſecret ſhinings of the Seed of God, it breathes towards him, and is conſtantly breathing forth ſome ſecret Deſires and Aſpirations towards him. It is in this ſenſe, that we are ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture commanded to <hi>Pray continually, Luke</hi> 18.1. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36.

                  <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Proyer</hi> is, when as the Spirit (being thus in the Exerciſe of Inward Retirement, and feeling the Breathing of the Spirit of God to ariſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Soul) receives Strength and Liberty, by a ſuperadded Motion and Influence of the Spirit, to bring forth either audible <hi>Sighs, Groans,</hi> or <hi>Words,</hi> and that either in publick Aſſemblies, or in private, or at Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="394" facs="unknown:003129_0204_0FF005CA432C6C78"/>
as ſuch who are moſt diligent have a near acceſs to God, and he taketh moſt delight to draw them by his Spirit, to approach and call upon him; ſo when many are gathered together in this watchful Mind, God doth frequently pour forth the Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er among them, and ſtir them thereunto, to the Edifying and Building up of one another in <hi>Love.</hi> But becauſe this <hi>Outward Prayer</hi> depends upon the <hi>Inward,</hi> as that which muſt follow it, and cannot be acceptably performed, but as attended with a ſuperadded Influence and Motion of the Spirit, therefore cannot we prefix ſet Times to <hi>Pray outwardly,</hi>

And therefore we queſtion not, but many, through neglect of this Inward Watchfulneſs and Retiredneſs of Mind, miſs many precious opportunities to <hi>Pray,</hi> and thereby are guilty in the ſight of God; yet would they Sin, if they ſhould ſet about the Act, until they firſt felt the Influence.

And <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is a neceſſity of this <hi>inward Retirement</hi> of the Mind, as previous to <hi>Prayer,</hi> that the Spirit may be felt to draw thereunto, appears, for that in moſt of thoſe places, where <hi>Prayer</hi> is commanded, <hi>Watching</hi> is prefixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as neceſſary to go before; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.42. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.33. &amp; 14 38. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36. from which it is evident, that this <hi>Watching</hi> was to go before <hi>Prayer.</hi> Now to what end is this <hi>Watching,</hi> or what is it, but a waiting to feel <hi>God's Spirit</hi> to draw unto <hi>Prayer,</hi>

Was not the End of them to ſignifie an Inward Purifying by an Outward Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And is not that alledged to be the End ſtill? And are the neceſſary Effects or Conſequences of it
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:003129_0220_0FF005F33A832428"/>

And if ſome by God's Grace, that are baptized with Water, are inwardly purified, ſo were ſome alſo under the Law; ſo that this is not any neceſſary conſequence or effect, neither of this, nor that Baptiſm. It is then plainly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to right Reaſon, as well as to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Teſtimony, to affirm <hi>that</hi> to be a Spiritual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance now, which was a Carnal Ordinance before, if it be ſtill the ſame, both as to its Author, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and End, however made to vary in ſome ſmall Circumſtances. The Spirituality of the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and of its <hi>Worſhip</hi> eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted not in ſuch ſuperficial Alterations of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; but after another manner. Therefore let our Adverſaries ſhew us, if they can, (without begging the Queſtion, and building upon ſome one or other of their own Principles, denied by us) where ever Chriſt appointed or ordained any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or Obſervation under the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> as belonging to the Nature of it, or ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary part of its <hi>Worſhip</hi> as is perpetually to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, which being one in Subſtance and Effects, (I ſpeak of Neceſſary, not Accidental Effects) yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome ſmall difference in Form or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, was before Carnal, notwithſtanding it was commanded by God under the <hi>Law,</hi> but now is become Spiritual, becauſe commanded by Chriſt under the <hi>Goſpel</hi>? And if they cannot do this, then if Water-Baptiſm was once a Carnal Ordinance, as the Apoſtle poſitively affirms it to have been, it remains a Carnal Ordinance ſtill; and if a Carnal Ordinance, then no neceſſary part of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>New Covenant Diſpenſation</hi>; and if no neceſſary part of it, then not needful to continue, nor to be practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch as live and walk under this <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> But in this, as in moſt other things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

all: For they might have done it by a Permiſſion, as being in uſe before Chriſt's Death; and becauſe the People, nurſed up with outward Ceremonies, could not be weaned wholly from them. And thus they uſed other things, as Circumciſion, and Legal Purifications, which yet they had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt to do, (to which we ſhall ſpeak more at length in the following <hi>Propoſition,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Supper.</hi>)</p>

                  </label> Altho' it ſhould be granted, that for a ſeaſon they did ſo far miſtake it, as to judge, that Water belonged to that Baptiſm, (which however I find no neceſſity of granting) yet I ſee not any great Abſurdity would thence follow. For it is plain, they did miſtake that Commiſſion, as to a main part of it, for a ſeaſon, as where he bids them <hi>Go teach all Nations</hi>; ſince ſome time after, they judged it unlawful to teach the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; yea, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf ſcrupled it, until by a Viſion conſtrained thereunto; for which after he had done it,<note place="margin">The Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles did <hi>ſcruple</hi> the teaching the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
                  </note> he was for a ſeaſon (until they were better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) judged by the reſt of his Brethren. Now, if the Education of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Propenſity to adhere and ſtick to the <hi>Jewiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> did ſo far influence them, that even after Chriſt's Reſurrection, and the <hi>pouring forth</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they could not receive nor admit of the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tho' Chriſt, in his Commiſſion to them, commanded them to preach to them; what further Abſurdity were it to ſuppoſe, that through the like Miſtake, the chiefeſt of them having been the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> and his Baptiſm being ſo much prized there among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they alſo took
<pb n="438" facs="unknown:003129_0226_0FF0060059B6C768"/>
Chriſt's Baptiſm, intended by him of the Spirit, to be that of Water, which was <hi>John</hi>'s, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly practiſed it for a ſeaſon? It ſuffices us, that if they were ſo miſtaken, (tho' I ſay not that they were ſo) they did not always remain under that Miſtake: Elſe <hi>Peter</hi> would not have ſaid of the Baptiſm, which now ſaves, <hi>that it is not a putting away of the filth of the Fleſh,</hi> which certainly Water-Baptiſm is.</p>
               <p>But further, They urge much <hi>Peter's</hi> baptizing <hi>Cornelius</hi>; in which they preſs two things, Firſt, <hi>That Water-Baptiſm is uſed, even to thoſe that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That it is ſaid poſitively, he commanded them to be baptized,</hi> Acts 10.47, 48.</p>
               <p>But neither of theſe doth neceſſarily infer Water-Baptiſm to belong to the New Covenant-Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor yet to be a perpetual ſtanding Ordinance in the Church. For <hi>firſt,</hi> all that this will amount to,<note place="margin">Whether <hi>Peter</hi>'s Baptizing ſome with Water makes it a ſtanding Ordinance to the <hi>Church?</hi>
                  </note> was, that <hi>Peter</hi> at that time baptized theſe Men; but that he did it by vertue of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. remains yet to be proved. And how doth the baptizing with Water, after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Holy Ghoſt, prove the caſe, more than the uſe of Circumciſion, and other Legal Rites, acknowledged to have been acted by him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? Alſo, no wonder if <hi>Peter,</hi> that thought it ſo ſtrange (notwithſtanding all that had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed before, and ſpoken by Chriſt) that the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> ſhould be made Partakers of the Goſpel, and with great difficulty, not without an extraordinary Impluſe thereunto, was brought to come to them, and eat with them, was apt to put this Ceremony upon them; which being, as it were, the particular Diſpenſation of <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Fore-runner of Chriſt,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have greater Affinity with the Goſpel, than the other <hi>Jewiſh Ceremonies,</hi> then uſed by the Church; but that will no ways infer our Adverſaries Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to theſe words, <hi>And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be baptized</hi>; it declareth matter of

                  <hi>Fact,</hi> not of <hi>Right,</hi> and amounteth to no more than, that <hi>Peter</hi> did at that time, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> command thoſe Perſons to be baptized with Water, which is not denied: But it ſaith nothing, that <hi>Peter</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Water Baptiſm to be a ſtanding and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Ordinance to the Church; neither can any Man of ſound Reaſon ſay, if he heed what he ſays, that a Command in <hi>matter of Fact</hi> to particular Perſons, loth infer the <hi>Thing commanded</hi> to be of general Obligation to all, if it be not otherwiſe bottomed upon ſome Poſitive Precept. Why doth <hi>Peter</hi>'s commanding <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houſhold to be baptized at that time, infer Water-Baptiſm to continue, more than his Conſtraining (which is more than commanding) the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in general to be circumciſed, and obſerve the Law?

                  <note place="margin">Two Errors the Ground of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about the <hi>Supper.</hi>
                  </note>The <hi>First</hi> of theſe Errors is, in making the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion or Participation of the Body, Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, to relate to that outward Body, Veſſel, or Temple, that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and walked and ſuffered in <hi>Judea</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it ſhould relate to the Spiritual Body, Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, even that <hi>Heavenly</hi> and <hi>Celeſtial Light</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which was the Food and Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Regenerate in all Ages, as we have already proved.</p>
               <pb n="457" facs="unknown:003129_0235_0FF0061770DC8F68"/>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Error is, in tying this Participation of the Body and Blood of Chriſt to that Ceremony, uſed by him with his Diſciples, in the breaking of Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if it had only a Relation thereto, or were only enjoyed in the uſe of that Ceremony, which it neither hath, nor is. For this is that Bread, which Chriſt in his Prayer teaches to call for, terming it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. the <hi>ſuperſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Bread,</hi> as the Greek hath it, and which the Soul partakes of, without any relation or neceſſary reſpect to this Ceremony, as ſhall be hereafter proved more at length.</p>
               <p>Theſe Two Errors being thus laid aſide, and the Contentions ariſing there from buried, all are agreed in the main Poſitions, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that the <hi>Body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Believers Souls</hi> do really feed upon the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, is neceſſary for the nouriſhing of the Soul.</hi> Secondly, that the <hi>Souls of Believers do really and truly partake and feed upon the Body, Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> But while Men are not content with the Spirituality of this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> going in their own Wills, and according to their own Inventions, to ſtrain and wreſt the Scriptures, for to tye this Spiritual Communion of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, to outward Bread and Wine, and ſuch like Carnal Ordinances; no wonder, if by their Carnal Apprehenſions, they run into Heaps and Confuſion. But becauſe it hath been generally ſuppoſed, that the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt had ſome ſpecial Relation to the Ceremony of <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread</hi>; I ſhall firſt refute that Opinion, and then proceed to conſider the Nature and Uſe of that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> and whether it be now <hi>neceſſary</hi> to continue; anſwering the Reaſons and Objections of ſuch as plead its Continuance, as a neceſſary and ſtanding Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

For tho' they that partake of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, cannot but remember him; yet the Lord, and his Death, may be remembred (as none can deny) where his Fleſh and Blood is not truly partaken of. So that ſince the very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and expreſs Ceremony may be witneſſed (to wit, the remembrance of the Lord's Death) and yet the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt not partaken of, it cannot have had any neceſſary Relation to it; elſe the partaking thereof would have been the end of it, and could not have been attained without this Participation. But on the contrary, we may well infer hence, that ſince the poſitive End of this Ceremony, is not the partaking of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, and that whoever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, cannot but remember him; that therefore ſuch need not this Ceremony to put them in remembrance of him.</p>

And for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> being in the uſe of this Ceremony, why they were ſo, and how that obliges not Chriſtians now to the ſame, ſhall be ſpoken of hereafter: It ſuffices at this time to conſider, that they were in the uſe of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in the uſe of it they were guilty of, and committed divers Abuſes. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Apoſtle here is giving them Directions how they may do it aright, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the right and proper Uſe and End of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, let it be obſerved, that the very expreſs and particular uſe of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, is <hi>to ſhew forth the Lord's Death,</hi> &amp;c.

the Lord's Body,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, That this infers no more neceſſary Relation, than any other religious Act; and amounts to no more than this, That ſince the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were in the uſe of this Ceremony, and ſo performed it as a religious Act,<note place="margin">Chriſt's Act of <hi>Bread</hi> &amp; <hi>Wine</hi> is not obliging others.</note> they ought to do it worthily, or elſe they ſhould bring Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon themſelves. Now this will not more infer the thing ſo practiſed by them, to be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary religious Act, obligatory upon others, than when <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord</hi>; it can be thence inferred, that the days, that ſome eſteemed and obſerved, did lay an Obligation upon others to do the ſame. But yet, as he that eſteemed a day, and placed Conſcience in keeping it, was to <hi>regard it to the Lord</hi>; and ſo it was to him, in ſo far as he dedicated it unto the Lord, the <hi>Lord's Day</hi>; he was to do it worthily, and if he did it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, he would be guilty of the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> and ſo keep it to his own Damnation: So alſo, ſuch as obſerve this Ceremony of Bread and Wine, it is to them the <hi>Bread of the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Cup of the Lord,</hi> becauſe they uſe it as a religious Act; and foraſmuch as their end therein is to <hi>ſhew forth the Lord's Death,</hi> and <hi>remember his Body</hi> that was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for them, and his <hi>Blood</hi> that was Shed for them. If, notwithſtanding they believe it is their Duty to do it, and make it a matter of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to forbear, if they do it without that due Preparation and Examination which every religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Act ought to be performed in; then, inſtead of truly remembring the Lord's Death, and his Body, and his Blood, they render themſelves guilty of it, as being in one Spirit with thoſe that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> guilty of the Blood of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
                  </note> and ſhed his Blood, tho' pretending with thankſgiving and joy to remember it. Thus the Scribes and Phariſees of old, tho' in Memory of the Prophets they garniſhed their Sepulchres; yet are ſaid by Chriſt to be <hi>guilty of their Blood.</hi> And
<pb n="465" facs="unknown:003129_0239_0FF006218BAF1AA8"/>
that no more can be hence inferred, appears from another Saying of the ſame Apoſtle, Rom. 14.23. <hi>He that doubteth is damned, if he eat,</hi> &amp;c. Where he, ſpeaking of thoſe that judged it unlawful to eat Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaith, <hi>If they eat doubting, they eat their own Damnation.</hi> Now it is manifeſt from all this, that either the doing or forbearing of this, was to another, that placeth no Conſcience in it, of no moment. So, I ſay, he that eateth that, which in his Conſcience he is perſwaded is not lawful for him to eat, doth eat his own Damnation: So he alſo, that placeth Conſcience in eating Bread and Wine, as a <hi>Religious Act,</hi> if he do it unprepared, and without that due Reſpect, wherein ſuch Acts ſhould be gone about, he <hi>eateth and drinketh his own Damnation, not diſcerning the Lord's Body,</hi> i. e. not minding what he doth, to wit <hi>with a ſpecial Reſpect to the Lord, and by way of ſpecial Commemoration of the Death of Christ.</hi>

Let us conſider another of the like nature, as it is at length expreſſed by <hi>John,</hi> c. 13. v. 3, 4, 8, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Jeſus riſeth from Supper, and laid aſide his Garments, and took a Towel, and gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf: After that, he poureth Water into a Baſon, and began to waſh the Diſciples Feet, and to wipe them with the Towel wherewith he was girded</hi>: Peter <hi>ſaid unto him, Thou ſhalt never waſh my Feet</hi>;<note place="margin">Chriſt's Waſhing of Feet, and its manner related.</note> Jeſus <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, If I waſh thee not, thou hast no part with me. So after he had waſhed their Feet,—he ſaid, Know ye what I have done to you? If I then, your Lord and Master, have waſhed your Feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers Feet: For I have given you an Example, that ye ſhould do, as I have done to you.</hi> As to which, let it be obſerved,<note place="margin">Compared with the Breaking of Bread.</note> that <hi>John</hi> relates this Paſſage to have been done at the ſame time with the other of <hi>breaking Bread</hi>; both being done the night of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> after Supper. If we regard the Narration of this, and the Circumſtances attending it, it was done with far more Solemnity; and preſcribed far more Punctually and Particularly, than the former. It is ſaid only, <hi>As he was eating, he took Bread</hi>; ſo that this would ſeem to be but an <hi>occaſional buſineſs:</hi>
                  <pb n="468" facs="unknown:003129_0241_0FF006277A3E7A08"/>
But here, <hi>he roſe up, he laid by his Garments, he girded himſelf, he poured out the Water, he waſhed their Feet, he wiped them with the Towel:</hi> He did this to all of them; which are Circumſtances ſurely far more obſervable, than thoſe noted in the other. The <hi>former</hi> was a Practice common among the <hi>Jews,</hi> uſed by all Maſters of Families, upon that occaſion; but <hi>this,</hi> as to the manner, and Perſon acting it, <hi>to wit,</hi> for the Maſter to riſe up, and waſh the Feet of his Servants and Diſciples, was more ſingular and obſervable. In the breaking of Bread, and giving of Wine, it is not pleaded by our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, nor yet mentioned in the Text, that he particularly put them into the hands of all; but breaking it, and bleſſing it, gave it the neareſt, and ſo they from hand to hand: But here it is mentioned, that he waſhed not the Feet of one or two, but of many. He ſaith not in the <hi>former, that if they do not eat of that Bread, and drink of that Wine, they ſhall be prejudiced by it</hi>; but here he ſaith expreſly to <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>if he waſh him not, he hath no part with him</hi>; which being ſpoken upon <hi>Peter</hi>'s refuſing to let him waſh his Feet, would ſeem to import no leſs, than not the Continuance only, but even the Neceſſity of this <hi>Ceremony.</hi> In the former he ſaith, as it were, paſſingly, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me</hi>; but here he ſitteth down again, he deſires them to conſider what he hath done, tells them poſitively,<note place="margin">The Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one anothers Feet, was left as an Example.</note> 
                  <hi>That as he hath done to them, ſo ought they to do to one another</hi>: And yet again he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubles that Precept, by telling them, <hi>he has given them an Example, that they ſhould do ſo likewiſe.</hi> If we reſpect the Nature of the thing, it hath as much in it, as either Baptiſm, or the Breaking of Bread; ſeeing it is an outward Element of a clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Nature, applied to the outward Man, by the Command and the Example of Chriſt, to ſignifie an inward Purifying. I would willingly propoſe this ſeriouſly to Men, that will be pleaſed to make

as nothing elſe appears from the Text, ſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text makes it plain; for they had all things in common: And therefore it is ſaid, verſ. 46. <hi>And they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking Bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their meat with gladneſs and ſingleneſs of heart.</hi> Who will not wilfully cloſe their Eyes, may ſee here, that their <hi>Breaking</hi> being joyned with their <hi>Eating,</hi> ſhews, that nothing elſe is here expreſſed, but that having all things in common, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing together, they alſo did break their Bread and eat their Meat together: In doing whereof, I ſhall not doubt, but they remembred the Lord; to follow whom they had, with ſo much Zeal and Reſignation, betaken themſelves. This is further manifeſt from <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2.

                     <hi>Deacons</hi> appointed for ſerving at Tables.</note> and finding themſelves over charged with that Burthen, appointed <hi>Deacons</hi> for that buſineſs, that they might give themſelves continually to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and to the <hi>Miniſtry of the Word</hi>; not leaving that, to ſerve Tables.

Now as the Increaſe of the Diſciples did incapacitate the Apoſtles any more to manage this; ſo it would ſeem, their further increaſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing in divers places, hindred the continuance of that practice of <hi>having things in common:</hi> But notwſtanding, ſo far at leaſt to remember or continue that <hi>ancient Cummunity,</hi> they did at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times come together, and break Bread toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Secondly,</hi> He blames them, in that they came together for the <hi>worſe,</hi> and not for the <hi>better</hi>; the Reaſon he gives of this, is, verſ. 21. <hi>For in eating every one hath taken before his own Supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken:</hi> Here it is plain,<note place="margin">Why the Cuſtom of <hi>Supping in common</hi> was uſed among Chriſtians.</note> that the Apoſtle condemns them for that, becauſe this Cuſtom of Supping in general was uſed among Chriſtians, for to increaſe their Love, and as a Memorial of Chriſt's Supping with the Diſciples; that they ſhould have ſo vitiated it, to eat it apart, and to come full, who had abundance, and hungry, who had little at home; whereby the very Uſe and End of this Practice was loſt and perverted: and therefore he blames them, that they did not either eat this in common at home, or reſerve their eating till they came all together to the publick Aſſembly.

This appears plainly by the following verſe 22. <hi>Have ye not Houſes to eat and drink in?

               <argument>
                  <p>Since God hath aſſumed to himſelf the Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> who alone can rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and govern it; therefore it is not lawful for any whoſoever, by vertue of any Authority or Principality they bear in the Goverment of this World, to force the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of others;<note place="margin">Luk. 9.55, 56.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§. I. <hi>LIberty of Conſcience</hi> from the Power of the Civil Magiſtrate, hath been of late Years ſo largely and learnedly handled, that I ſhall not need to be but brief in it; yet it is to be lamented, that few have walked anſwerably to this Principle, each pleading it for themſelves, but ſcarce allowing it to others; as hereafter I ſhall have occaſion more at length to obſerve.</p>
               <p>It will be fit in the firſt place, for clearing of Miſtakes, to ſay ſomething of the State of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,</hi> that what follows may be the more clearly underdood.</p>
               <p>By [<hi>Conſcience</hi>] then, as in the Explanation of the <hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>Sixth Propoſitions</hi> I have obſerved, is to be

underſtood, <hi>That Perſwaſion of the Mind, which ariſes from the Understanding's being poſſeſſed with the Belief of the Truth or Falſity of any thing:</hi> Which,<note place="margin">What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is?</note> tho' it may be falſe or Evil upon the matter, yet if a Man ſhould go againſt his Perſwaſion, or Conſcience, he ſhould commit a Sin; becauſe what a Man doth contrary to his Faith, tho' his Faith be wrong, is no ways acceptable to God. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.23</note> 
                  <hi>and he that doubteth, is damned, if he eat:</hi> Tho' the thing might have been lawful to another; and that this doubting to eat ſome kind of <hi>Meats</hi> (ſince all the Creatures of God are good, and for the uſe of Man, <hi>if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Thankſgiving</hi>) might be a Superſtition, or at leaſt a Weakneſs, which were better removed. Hence, <hi>Ames de Caſ. Conſ.</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Conſcience, altho' erring, doth evermore bind, ſo as that he ſinneth, who doth contrary to his Conſcience,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>So the Queſtion is, Firſt, <hi>Whether the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hath Power to force Men in things Religious, to do contrary to their Conſcience; and if they will not, to puniſh them in their Goods, Liberties or Lives</hi>? This we hold in the Negative. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> As we would have the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> avoiding this extream of incroaching upon Men's Conſciences; ſo on the other hand, we are far from joyning with, or ſtrengthening ſuch <hi>Libertines,</hi> as would ſtretch the Liberty of their Conſciences, to the Prejudice of their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> or to the Ruine of <hi>Humane Society.</hi> We underſtand therefore by <hi>Matters of Conſcience,</hi> ſuch as immediately relate betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> that are under the ſame <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion:</hi> As to meet together and worſhip God in that way, which they judge is moſt acceptable unto him; and not to incroach upon, or ſeek to force their Neighbours, otherwiſe than by Reaſon, or ſuch other Means, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles

And therefore we believe it may be very lawful for a <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> if ſhe find any of her Members fall into any Error, after due Admonitions and Inſtructions, according to Goſpel-Order, if ſhe find them Pertinacious, to <hi>cut them off,</hi> from her Fellowſhip, by the <hi>Sword of the

Spirit,</hi> and deprive them of thoſe Priviledges, which they had as Fellow-Members; but not to cut them off from the World, by the <hi>Temporal Sword,</hi> or rob them of their Common Priviledges, as Men; ſeeing they enjoy not theſe as Chriſtians, or under ſuch a Fellowſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p, but as Men, and Members of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith well, <hi>(de Anath.) We must condemn and reprove the Evil Doctrines that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Hereticks; but ſpare the Men, and pray for their Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. II. But that no Man, by vertue of any Power or Principality he hath in the Government of this World, hath Power over the <hi>Conſciences of Men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conſcience the Throne of God.</note> is apparent, becauſe <hi>the Conſcience of Man, is the Seat and Throne of God in him,</hi> of which God is the alone proper and infallible <hi>Judge,</hi> who by his Power and Spirit, can alone rectifie the Miſtakes of <hi>Conſcience</hi>; and therefore hath reſerved to himſelf the Power of puniſhing the Errors thereof, as he ſeeth meet. Now for the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to aſſume this, is to take upon him to meddle with things not within the compaſs of his Juriſdiction; for if this were within the compaſs of his Juriſdiction, he ſhould be the proper Judge in theſe things; and alſo it were needful to him, as an Eſſential Qualification of his being a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> to be capable to judge in them. But that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,</hi> as a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> is neither proper Judge in theſe Caſes, nor yet that the Capacity ſo to be, is requiſite in him, as a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny; or elſe they muſt ſay, That all the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Magiſtrates,</hi> were either no <hi>lawful Magiſtrates,</hi> as wanting ſomething Eſſential to Magiſtracy, and this were contrary to the expreſs Doctrine of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. or elſe (which is more abſurd) that thoſe <hi>Heathen Magistrates</hi> were proper Judges in Matters of <hi>Conſcience</hi> amongſt <hi>Christians.</hi> As for that Evaſion, That the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ought to puniſh according to the Church Cenſure and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is indeed no leſs, than to make the
<pb n="490" facs="unknown:003129_0252_0FF0063F668363E8"/>
                  <hi>Magistrate</hi> the <hi>Church's Hang-Man</hi>; we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of it hereafter. But if the chief Members of the <hi>Church,</hi> tho' ordained to inform, inſtruct and reprove, are not to have dominion over the <hi>Faith</hi> nor <hi>Conſciences</hi> of the Faithful, is the Apoſtle expreſly affirms, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. then far leſs ought they to uſurp this Dominion, or ſtir up the Magiſtrate to perſecute and murther thoſe, who will not yield to them therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi>; This pretended Power of the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> is both contrary unto, and inconſiſtent with the Nature of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is a thing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extrinſick to the Rule and Government of <hi>Political States,</hi> as Chriſt expreſly ſignified, ſaying, His <hi>Kingdom</hi> was <hi>not of this World</hi>: And if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> had had any neceſſary Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto, then Chriſt had not ſaid ſo. But he abundantly hath ſhewn, by his Example, whom we are chiefly to imitate in matters of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it's by <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> and the <hi>Power of God</hi>; not by <hi>Whips, Impriſonments, Baniſhments</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings,</hi> that the Goſpel is to be propagated; and that thoſe, that are the Propagators of it, are often to ſuffer by the Wicked, but never to cauſe the Wicked to ſuffer. When he ſends forth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he tells them, he ſends them forth as <hi>Lambs among Wolves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10.16.</note> to be willing to be <hi>devoured,</hi> not to <hi>devour</hi>; he tells them of their being <hi>whipped, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned</hi> and <hi>killed</hi> for their Conſcience; but never that they ſhall ever <hi>whip, impriſon</hi> or <hi>kill</hi>: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if <hi>Chriſtians</hi> muſt be as <hi>Lambs,</hi> it is not the Nature of <hi>Lambs</hi> to deſtroy or devour any. It ſerves nothing to alledge, That in Chriſt's and his Apoſtles times, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> were <hi>Heathens</hi>; and therefore Chriſt and his Apoſtles (nor yet any of the Believers) being no <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> could not exerciſe the Power: Becauſe it cannot be denied, but Chriſt, being the <hi>Son of God,</hi> had a true Right to all <hi>Kingdoms,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28.18.</note> and was <hi>righteous Heir</hi> of the Earth.
<pb n="491" facs="unknown:003129_0252_0FF0063F668363E8"/>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> as to his <hi>Power,</hi> it cannot be denied, but he could, if he had ſeen meet, have called for <hi>Legions of Angels</hi> to defend him, and have forced the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the Earth to be ſubject unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.53. So that it was only, becauſe it was contrary to the Nature of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Goſpel and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to uſe any Force or Violence in the gathering of Souls to him. This he abundantly expreſſed in his Reproof to the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> who would have been calling for <hi>Fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from Heaven,</hi> to burn thoſe that refuſed to receive Chriſt: It is not to be doubted, but this was as great a Crime, as now to be in an Error concerning the Faith and Doctrine of Chriſt. That there was not Power wanting, to have puniſhing thoſe Refuſers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> cannot be doubted; for they that could do other Miracles, might have done this alſo. And moreover, they wanted not the precedent of a holy Man under the Law, as did <hi>Elias</hi>; yet we ſee what Chriſt ſaith to them, <hi>Ye know not what Spirit ye are of,</hi> Luke 9.55. <hi>For the Son of Man is not come to deſtroy Men's Lives, but to ſave them.</hi> Here Chriſt ſhews, that ſuch kind of <hi>Zeal</hi> was no ways approved of him; and ſuch as think to make way for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>Goſpel,,</hi> by this means, do not underſtand what <hi>Spirit they are of.</hi> But if it was not lawful to call for <hi>Fire from Heaven,</hi> to deſtroy ſuch as refuſed to receive Chriſt; it is far leſs lawful to kindle <hi>Fire upon Earth</hi> to deſtroy thoſe that believe in Chriſt; becauſe they will not believe, nor can believe as the Magiſtrates do, for Conſcience ſake. And if it was not lawful for the Apoſtles, who had ſo large a meaſure of the Spirit, and were ſo little liable to Miſtake, to force others to their Judgment; it can be far leſs lawful now for Men, that, as Experience declareth, and many of themſelves confeſs, are Fallible, and often Miſtaken, to kill and deſtroy all ſuch, as cannot (becauſe otherwiſe perſwaded in their Minds) judge and believe in matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="492" facs="unknown:003129_0253_0FF0064112A48988"/>
juſt as they do. And if it was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Wiſdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was and is <hi>King of Kings,</hi> by outward Force to conſtrain others to believe him, or receive him, as being a thing inconſiſtent with the Nature of his <hi>Ministry</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Government</hi>; do not they groſly offend him, that will needs be wiſer than he, and think to force Men, againſt their Perſwaſion, to conform to their Doctrine and Worſhip? The Word of the Lord ſaid, <hi>Not by Power and by Might, but by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> Zach. 4.6. But theſe ſay, <hi>Not by the Spirit of the Lord, but by Might and Carnal Power.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith plainly, <hi>We wrestle not with Fleſh and Blood</hi>; and, <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are not Carnal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4.</note> 
                  <hi>but Spiritual:</hi> But theſe Men will needs wreſtle with Fleſh and Blood, when they cannot prevail with the Spirit and the Underſtanding; and not having Spiritual Weapons, go about with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weapons, to eſtabliſh Chriſt's Kingdom, which they can never do: And therefore, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is well ſifted, it is found to be more out of <hi>Love to Self,</hi> and from a Principle of Pride in Man, to have all others to bow to him, than from the <hi>Love of God.</hi> Chriſt indeed takes another method, for he ſaith, <hi>He will make his People a willing People in the Day of his Power:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 10.31.</note> But theſe Men labour againſt Mens Wills and Conſciences, not by <hi>Chriſt's Power,</hi> but by the <hi>Outward Sword,</hi> to make Men the <hi>People of Christ,</hi> which they can never do, as ſhall hereafter be ſhewn.</p>

So that they, that will notwithſtanding be pulling up that, which they judge is <hi>Tares,</hi> do openly declare, that they make no Bones to break the <hi>Commands of Chriſt.</hi> Miſerable is that Evaſion, which ſome of our Adverſaries uſe here, in alledging, theſe <hi>Tares</hi> are meant of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and not of <hi>Hereticks</hi>!

                  </label> I anſwer; Beſides that this is a method no ways allowed by Chriſt, as is above proved; ſurely the Church can be no ways bettered by the Acceſſion of Hypocrites, but greatly corrupted and endangered; for open Hereſies Men may be aware of, and ſhun ſuch as profeſs them, when they are ſeperated from the Church by her Cenſures: But ſecret Hypocrites may putrifie the Body, and leaven it, ere Men be aware. And if the Diſſenters prove reſolute, and ſuffer boldly for the Opinions they eſteem right, Experience ſheweth, that ſuch Sufferings often tend to the Commendation of the Sufferers, but never of the Perſecutors. For ſuch Sufferings ordinarily breed Compaſſion, and beget a Curioſity in others, to enquire the more diligently into the things, for which they ſee Men ſuffer ſuch great Loſſes ſo boldly; and is alſo able to beget an Opinion, that it is for ſome good they do ſo ſuffer: It being no ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that Men will venture all, meerly to acquire Fame; which may as well be urged, to detract from the Reputation of all the Martyrs, unleſs ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Arguments be brought againſt it, than a <hi>Halter</hi> or a <hi>Faggot.</hi> But ſuppoſing this Principle, <hi>That the</hi> Magiſtrate <hi>hath Power to force the Conſciences of his Subjects, and to puniſh them, if they will not comply:</hi> Very great Inconveniences and Abſurdities will follow, and even ſuch as are inconſiſtent with the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> It will naturally follow, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ought to do it, and ſinneth by omiſſion
<pb n="499" facs="unknown:003129_0256_0FF00649B89CB4D0"/>
of his Duty, if he do it not. Will it not then hence be inferred, that Chriſt was defective to his Church; who, having Power to force Men, and to call for <hi>Legions of Angels</hi> ſo to do, did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding not exert that Power, but left his Church to the Mercy of the Wicked, without ſo neceſſary a Bulwark?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi>; Seeing every Magiſtrate is to exerciſe his Power, according to the beſt Underſtanding he hath, being obliged ſo to do, for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of what he in Conſcience is perſwaded to be Truth: Will not this juſtifie all the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors in their Perſecutions againſt Chriſtians? Will not this juſtifie the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> which yet is Odious not only to Proteſtants, but to many mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Papiſts? How can Proteſtants in reaſon condemn the Papiſts for perſecuting them, ſeeing they do but exerciſe a Lawful Power, according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and beſt Underſtanding; and do no more to them, than the Sufferers profeſs they would do to them, if they were in the like capacity? Which takes away all ground of Commiſeration from the Sufferers; whereas that was the ground that gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of old, Reputation to the Chriſtians, that they, being Innocent, ſuffered, who neither had, nor by Principle could, hurt any. But there is little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to pity one, that is but dealt by, according as he would deal with others. For to ſay, <hi>They have not reaſon to perſecute us, becauſe they are in the wrong, and we in the right,</hi> is but miſerably to beg the Queſtion. Doth not this Doctrine ſtrengthen the Hands of Perſecutors every where, and that Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, from a Principle of Self-preſervation? For who can blame me for deſtroying him, that I know waits but for an occaſion to deſtroy me, if he could? Yea, this makes all Suffering for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which of old was the Glory of Chriſtians, to be but of pure neceſſity; whereby they are not led as <hi>Lambs to the ſlaughter,</hi> as was the <hi>Captain of
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:003129_0257_0FF0064C341F3B30"/>
their Salvation</hi>; but rather as <hi>Wolves</hi> catched in the Snare, who only bite not again, becauſe they are not able; but could they get force, would be as ready to lead thoſe the ſame way, that led them. Where is the Faith and Patience of the Saints? For indeed, it is but a ſmall Glory to make a Vertue of Neceſſity, and Suffer, becauſe I cannot help it. Every Thief and Murtherer would be a Martyr, at that rate; Experience hath abundantly proved this in theſe laſt Centuries. For, however each Party talk of <hi>paſſively</hi> obeying the Magiſtrate in ſuch caſes, and that the Power reſides in him; yet it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that from this Principle it naturally follows, than any Party, ſuppoſing themſelves right, ſhould ſo ſoon as they are able, endeavour at any rate to get uppermoſt, that they might bring under thoſe of another Opinion, and force the Magiſtrate to uphold their Way, to the ruine of all others. What Engine the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> uſed to make of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Power in this thing, upon any pretence of diſlike to any Prince or State, even for very ſmall Hereſies, in their own account, to depoſe Princes, and ſet up their Subjects againſt them, and give their Dominions to other Princes to ſerve his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, they cannot be ignorant, that have read the Life of <hi>Hildebrand</hi>; and how Proteſtants have vindicated the Liberty of their Conſciences, after this ſame manner, is apparent. They ſuffered much in <hi>France,</hi> to the great Increaſe and Advantage of their Party; but how ſoon they found themſelves conſiderable, and had gotten ſome Princes upon their ſide, they began to let the King know, that they muſt either have the Liberty of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, or elſe they would purchaſe it; not by Suffering, but by Fighting. And the Experience of other Proteſtant States ſhews, that if <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, to pleaſe the Papiſts, had not quitted his Religion, to get the Crown the more peaceably, and ſo the Proteſtants had prevailed with the Sword,
<pb n="501" facs="unknown:003129_0257_0FF0064C341F3B30"/>
they would as well have taught the Papiſts with the Faggot, and led them to the Stake: So that this Principle of Perſecution, on all hands, is the ground of all thoſe Miſeries and Contentions. For ſo long as any Party is perſwaded, that it is both lawful for them, and their duty, if in power, to deſtroy thoſe that differ from them; it naturally follows, they ought to uſe all means poſſible to get that Power, whereby they may ſecure themſelves in the ruine of their Adverſaries. And that <hi>Papiſts</hi> judge it not unlawful to compel the Magiſtrate, if they be ſtrong enough to do it, to effect this; Experience ſhews it to be a known Popiſh principle, That <hi>the Pope may depoſe an Heretick Prince, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the People from the Oath of Fidelity:</hi> And the Pope, as is above ſaid, hath done ſo to divers Princes; and this Doctrine is defended by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> againſt <hi>Barclay.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> refuſed <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, till he quitted his Religion. And as for Proteſtants, many of them ſcruple not to affirm, <hi>That</hi> wicked Kings <hi>and</hi> Magiſtrates <hi>may be depoſed and killed</hi>; yea, our <hi>Scotch Preſbyterians</hi> are as poſitive in it, as any <hi>Jeſuits</hi>; who would not admit King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, tho' otherwiſe a Proteſtant Prince, unleſs he would ſweat to Renounce <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> a matter of a great difference, tho' contrary to his Conſcience. Now how little proportion theſe things bear with the Primitive Chriſtians, and the Religion propagated by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, needs no great demonſtration; and it is obſervable, That notwithſtanding many other Superſtitions crept into the Church very early, yet this of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was ſo inconſiſtent with the Nature of the Goſpel, and Liberty of Conſcience, as we have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it, ſuch an innate and natural part of the Chriſtian Religion, that almoſt all the Chriſtian Writers, for the firſt Three Hundred Years, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly contended for it, condemning the contrary Opinion.</p>

               <p n="6">§. VI. Now the ground of Perſecution, as hath been above ſhewn, is an <hi>unwillingneſs to ſuffer</hi>; for no Man, that will perſecute another for his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> would ſuffer for his own, if he could avoid it, ſeeing his Principle obliges him, if he had power, by force to eſtabliſh that which he judges is the Truth, and ſo to force others to it. Therefore I judge it meer, for the Information of the Nations, briefly to add ſomething in this place concerning the <hi>Nature of true Chriſtian Sufferings</hi>; whereunto a very faithful Teſtimony has been born by God's Witneſſes, which he hath raiſed up in this Age, beyond what hath been generally known or practiſed for theſe many Generations, yea, ſince the Apoſtaſie took place. Yet 'tis not my deſign here in any wiſe to derogate from the Sufferings of the Proteſtant Martyrs, whom I believe to have walked in Faithfulneſs towards God, according to the Diſpenſation of <hi>Light</hi> in that Day appearing, and of which many were utter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Perſecution, as by their Teſtimonies againſt it might be made appear.</p>
               <p>But the True, Faithful and Chriſtian Suffering is, <hi>for, Men to profeſs what they are perſwaded is right, and ſo practiſe and perform their Worſhip towards God, as being their true right ſo to do; and neither to do more in that, becauſe of outward incouragement from Men; nor any whit leſs, becauſe of the fear of their Laws and Acts againſt it.</hi> Thus for a Chriſtian Man to vindicate his juſt Liberty, with ſo much Boldneſs, and yet Innocency, will in due time, tho' through Blood, purchaſe Peace; as this Age has in ſome meaſure Experienced, and many are Witneſſes of it; which yet ſhall be more apparent to the World, as <hi>Truth</hi> takes place in the Earth. But they greatly ſin againſt this excellent Rule, that in time of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do not profeſs their own way, ſo much as they would, if it were otherwiſe; and yet, when they
<pb n="508" facs="unknown:003129_0261_0FF0065618A697B8"/>
can get the Magiſtrate upon their ſide, not only ſtretch their own Liberty to the utmoſt, but ſeek to eſtabliſh the ſame, by denying it to others.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the People call'd, <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi>
                  </note>But of this excellent Patience and Sufferings, the Witneſſes of God, in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have given a manifeſt proof: For ſo ſoon as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his <hi>Truth</hi> among them, without regard to all Oppoſition, or what they might meet with, they went up and down, as they were moved of the Lord, preaching and propagating the <hi>Truth</hi> in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-places, High ways, Streets, and publick Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, tho' daily beaten, whipped, bruiſed, halled and impriſoned therefor. And when there was any where a Church or Aſſembly gathered, they taught them to keep their Meetings openly, and not to ſhut the Door, nor do it by ſtealth, that all might know it, and who would might enter. And as hereby all juſt occaſion of fear of Plotting againſt the Government was fully removed, ſo this their Courage and Faithfulneſs, in not giving over their meeting together (but more eſpecially the Preſence and Glory of God, manifeſted in the Meeting, being terrible to the Conſciences of the Perſecutors) did ſo weary out the Malice of their Adverſaries, that often-times they were forced to leave their Work undone. For when they came to break up a Meeting, they were forced to take every Individual out by force; they not being free to give up their Liberty, by diſſolving at their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; And when they were halled out, unleſs they were kept forth by Violence, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned peaceably to their place. Yea, when ſometimes the Magiſtrates have pulled down their Meeting-houſes, they have met the next day openly upon the Rubbiſh, and ſo by Innocency kept their Poſſeſſion and Ground, being properly their own, and their right to meet and worſhip God being not forfeited to any. So that when Armed Men have come to diſſolve them, it was
<pb n="509" facs="unknown:003129_0261_0FF0065618A697B8"/>
impoſſible for them to do it, unleſs they had killed every one; for they ſtood ſo cloſe together, that no force could move any one to ſtir, until vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently pull'd thence: So that when the Malice of their Oppoſers ſtirred them to take Shovels, and throw the Rubbiſh upon them, there they ſtood unmoved, being willing, if the Lord ſhould ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to have been there buried alive, witneſſing for him. As this Patient, but yet Couragious way of Suffering, made the Perſecutors work very heavy and weariſom unto them; ſo the Courage and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the Sufferers, uſing no Reſiſtance, nor bringing any Weapons to defend themſelves, not ſeeking any ways Revenge upon ſuch occaſions, did ſecretly ſmite the Hearts of the Perſecutors, and made their Chariot-wheels go on heavily: Thus after much and many kind of Sufferings thus pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently born, which to rehearſe would make a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of it ſelf, which may in due time be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the Nations, (for we have them upon Record) a kind of <hi>Negative Liberty</hi> has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſo that at preſent for the moſt part we meet together without diſturbance from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. But on the contrary, moſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> when they have not the allowance and toleration of the Magiſtrate, meet only in ſecret, and hide their Teſtimony; and if they be diſcovered, if there be any probability of making their eſcape by force (or ſuppoſe it were by cutting off thoſe that ſeek them out) they will do it; whereby they loſe the Glory of their Sufferings, by not appearing as the innocent Followers of Chriſt, nor having a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Harmleſneſs in the Hearts of their Purſuers; their Fury, by ſuch reſiſtance, is the more kindled againſt them. As to this laſt part, of reſiſting ſuch as perſecute them, they can lay claim to no Precept from Chriſt, nor any Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of him, or his Apoſtles approved.</p>

                  </label> To all which I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to that Saying of Chriſt, it is a Queſtion, if it had any further Relation, than to that particular Meſſage, with which he ſent them to the <hi>Jews</hi>; yea, the latter end of the words ſeem expreſly to hold forth ſo much, <hi>For ye ſhall not have gone over the Cities of</hi> Juda, <hi>till the Son of Man be come.</hi> Now a particular Practice or Command, for a particular time, will not ſerve for a Precedent to any, at this day, to ſhun the Croſs of Chriſt. But ſuppoſing this Precept to reach farther, it muſt be ſo underſtood, to be made uſe of only according as the Spirit giveth liberty; elſe no Man that could flee,<note place="margin">Fleeing in time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, not allowed.</note> might ſuffer Perſecution. How then did not the Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> flee, when they were the firſt time perſecuted at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> But on the contrary, went the next day, after they were diſcharged by the Council, and preached boldly to the People. But indeed many are but too capable to ſtretch ſuch Sayings as theſe for Self-preſervation, and therefore have great ground to fear, when they interpret them, that they ſhun to witneſs for Chriſt, for fear of hurt to themſelves, leſt they miſtake them. As for that private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Diſciples, we have only an account of the matter of Fact, but that ſuffices not to make of it a Precedent for us, and Mens aptneſs to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them in that (which, for ought we know, might have been an Act of Weakneſs) and not in other things of the contrary nature, ſhews, that it is not a true Zeal to be like thoſe Diſciples, but indeed a Deſire to preſerve themſelves, which
<pb n="511" facs="unknown:003129_0262_0FF006597242DA10"/>
moves them ſo to do. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As to that of <hi>Paul</hi>'s being conveyed out of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> the caſe was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and is not to be doubted, but it was done by a ſpecial Allowance from God, who having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him to be a principal Miniſter of his Goſpel, ſaw meet, in his Wiſdom, to diſappoint the wicked Council of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But our Adverſaries have no ſuch Pretext for fleeing, whoſe fleeing proceeds from Self-Preſervation, not from Immediate Revelation. And that <hi>Paul</hi> made not this the method of his procedure, appears, in that at another time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the perſwaſion of his Friends, and certain Prophecies of his Sufferings to come, he would not be diſſwaded from going up to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which according to the fore mentioned Rule, he ſhould have done.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To conclude this matter, Glory to God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">To this year <hi>17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor was it any outward Intereſt hath procured it unto us, but the Teſtimony of our Harmleſneſs in the Hearts of our Superiours: For God hath preſerved us hitherto in the patient Sufferings of Jeſus, that we have not given away our Cauſe by perſecuting any, which few, if any, Chriſtians that I know can ſay. Now againſt our Unparallell'd, yet innocent and Chriſtian Cauſe, our Malicious Enemies have nothing to ſay, but that if we had Power, we would do ſo likewiſe. This is a piece of meer unreaſonable Malice, and a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they take to judge of things to come, which they have not by Immediate Revelation; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is the greateſt heighth of harſh Judgment to ſay, Men would do contrary to their profeſſed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<pb n="512" facs="unknown:003129_0263_0FF0065B674446D0"/>
if they could, who have from their Practice hitherto given no ground for it, and wherein they only judge others by themſelves: Such Conjectures cannot militate againſt us, ſo long as we are Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. And if we ever prove guilty of Perſecution, by forcing other Men by Corporal Puniſhment to our way, then let us be judged the greateſt of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and let not any ſpare to perſecute us. <hi>Amen, ſaith my Soul.</hi>

               <p>But ſuch Policy it is, ſay I, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles made uſe of, and all good Chriſtians ought to do; yea, ſo far hath Truth prevailed by the Purity of its Followers, that if one that is called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> do but that which is common among them, as to <hi>laugh,</hi> and be <hi>wanton, ſpeak at large,</hi> and keep not his <hi>word</hi> punctually, or be overtaken with <hi>hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or <hi>anger,</hi> they preſently ſay, <hi>O this is againſt your Profeſſion</hi>!

But if they can find any, under our Name, in any of thoſe Evils common among themſelves, (as who can imagine, but among ſo many Thouſands, there will be ſome Chaff, ſince of Twelve Apoſtles, one was found to be a Devil) O how will they inſult, and make more Noiſe of the eſcape of one <hi>Quaker,</hi> than of an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred among themſelves.</p>

               <p>Before I enter upon a particular Diſquiſition of theſe things,<note place="margin">Degrees of Dignity &amp; Precedency allowed.</note> I ſhall firſt premiſe ſome general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to prevent all Miſtakes; and next add ſome general Conſiderations, which equally reſpect all of them. I would not have any judge, that hereby we intend to deſtroy the <hi>mutual Relation,</hi> that either is betwixt <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People, Maſter</hi> and <hi>Servants, Parents</hi> and <hi>Children</hi>; nay, not at all: We ſhall evidence, that our Principle in theſe things hath no ſuch Tendency, and that theſe Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are rather better eſtabliſhed, than any ways hurt by it. <hi>Next,</hi> Let not any judge, that from our opinion in theſe things, any neceſſity of <hi>Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> will follow, or that all Men muſt have things in <hi>common.</hi> Our Principle leaves every Man to enjoy that peaceably, which either his own Induſtry, or his Parents, have purchaſed to them; only he is thereby inſtructed to uſe it aright, both for his own good, and that of his Brethren; and all to the Glory of God: In which alſo his Acts are to be <hi>voluntary,</hi> and no ways <hi>conſtrained.</hi> And further, we ſay not hereby, that no Man may uſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more or leſs than another: For we know, that as it hath pleaſed God to diſpenſe it diverſly, giving to ſome more, and ſome leſs, ſo they may uſe it accordingly. The ſeveral Conditions, under which Men are diverſly ſtated,<note place="margin">Education differs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</note> together with their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions anſwering thereunto, do ſufficiently ſhew this: The <hi>Servant</hi> is not the ſame way Educated, as the <hi>Maſter</hi>; nor the <hi>Tenant,</hi> as the <hi>Landlord</hi>; nor the <hi>Rich,</hi> as the <hi>Poor</hi>; nor the <hi>Prince,</hi> as the <hi>Peaſant.</hi> Now, tho' it be not lawful for any, however great Abundance they may have, or what ever then Education may be, to uſe that which is meerly ſuperfluous: Yet ſeeing their Education has accuſtomed them thereunto, and their Capacity enables them ſo to do, without being Profuſe or Extravagant, they may uſe things better in their kind, than ſuch whoſe Education hath neither accuſtomed them to ſuch things, nor their Capacity
<pb n="517" facs="unknown:003129_0265_0FF006608126BD20"/>
will reach to compaſs them. For it is beyond que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that whatever thing the Creation affords,<note place="margin">The lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Uſe of the Creation</note> is for the uſe of Man, and the moderate uſe of them is lawful; yet, <hi>per accidens,</hi> they may be unlawful to ſome, and not to others. As for inſtance, he that by reaſon of his Eſtate and Education hath been uſed to eat <hi>Fleſh</hi> and drink <hi>Wine,</hi> and to be cloathed with the <hi>fineſt Wool,</hi> if his Eſtate will bear it, &amp; he uſe it neither in Superfluity, nor Immoderately, he may do it; and perhaps, if he ſhould apply himſelf to feed or be cloathed, as are the Peaſants, it might prejudice the Health of his Body, and nothing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Soul. But if a Man, whoſe Eſtate and Education had accuſtomed him to both <hi>courſer Food</hi> and <hi>Rayment,</hi> ſhould ſtretch himſelf beyond what he had, or were uſed to, to the manifeſt prejudice of his Family and Children, no doubt it would be unlawful to him, even ſo to eat or be cloathed, as another, in whom it is lawful; for that that other may be as much mortified, and have denied himſelf as much in coming down to that, which this aſpires to, as he is willing to be like him, aſpires beyond what he either is able, or hath accuſtomed to do. The ſafe place then is, for ſuch as have Fulneſs, to watch over themſelves, that they uſe it moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and reſcind all Superfluities; being willing, ſo far as they can, to help the reed of thoſe, to whom Providence hath allotted a ſmaller allowance. <hi>Let the Brother of high degree rejoyce, in that he is abaſed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Rich to help the Needy.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſuch as God calls in a low degree, to be content with their Condition, not envying thoſe Brethren, who have greater abundance,</hi> knowing <hi>they have received abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as to the inward Man</hi>; which is chiefly to be regarded. And therefore beware of ſuch a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as to uſe their Calling as an Engine to be <hi>Richer,</hi> knowing, they have this advantage beyond the <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> that are called, that the Truth doth not any ways abaſe them, nay, not in the eſteem of the World, as it doth the other; but
<pb n="518" facs="unknown:003129_0266_0FF006632F097930"/>
that they are rather exalted thereby, in that as to the inward and Spiritual Fellowſhip of the Saints, they became the Brethren and Companions of the greateſt and richeſt; and in this reſpect, <hi>let him of low degree rejoyce, that he is exalted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, I would ſeriouſly propoſe unto all ſuch, as mind in reality to be Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and that in <hi>Nature,</hi> and not in <hi>Name</hi> only; Whether it were not deſirable, and would not greatly contribute to the Commendation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and to the Increaſe of the Life and Vertue of Chriſt, <hi>if all ſuperfluous Titles of Honour, Profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Prodigality in Meat and Apparel, exceſs of Gaming, Sporting and Playing,</hi> were laid aſide and forborn? And whether ſuch as lay them aſide, in ſo doing, walk not more like the Diſciples of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and are therein nearer their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, than ſuch as uſe them? Whether the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them aſide would hinder any from being good Chriſtians? Or if Chriſtians might not be better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, than with them? Certainly the Sober and Serious among all ſorts, will ſay, <hi>Yea.</hi> Then ſurely ſuch as lay them aſide, as reckoning them unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Chriſtians, are not to be blamed, but rather commended for ſo doing: Becauſe that in Principle and Practice, they effectually advance that, which others acknowledge were deſirable; but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make effectual, ſo long as they allow the uſe of them as lawful. And God hath made it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in this Age, that by diſcovering the Evil of ſuch things, and leading his Witneſſes out of them, and to teſtifie againſt them, he hath produced ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in many that Mortification and Abſtraction from the <hi>Love and Cares of this World,</hi> who daily are Converſing in the World (but inwardly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed out of it) both in Wedlock, and in their lawful Imployments, which was judged, could only be obtained by ſuch as were ſhut up in Cloyſters and Monaſteries.

                  <note place="margin">Titles.</note> Becauſe theſe <hi>Titles</hi> are no part of that Obedience, which is due to Magiſtrates or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; neither doth the giving them add to, or diminiſh from that Subjection we owe to them, which conſiſts <hi>in obeying their just and lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> not in <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Deſignations.</hi>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We find not, that in the Scripture any ſuch Titles are uſed, either under the Law,<note place="margin">Under the Law and Goſpel.</note> or the Goſpel: But that in the ſpeaking to Kings, Princes, or Nobles, they uſed only a ſimple Compellation, as, <hi>O King!</hi> And that without any further Deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſave perhaps the Name of the Perſon, as, <hi>O King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Lying Titles.</note> It lays a Neceſſity upon Chriſtians moſt frequently to Lye; becauſe the Perſons, obtaining theſe Titles, either by Election, or Hereditarily, may frequently be found to have nothing really in them, deſerving them, or anſwering to them: As ſome, to whom it is ſaid, <hi>Your Excellency,</hi> having nothing of <hi>Excellency in them</hi>; and who is called, <hi>Your Grace,</hi> appear to be an Enemy to <hi>Grace</hi>; and he who is called <hi>Your Honour,</hi> is known to be <hi>Baſe and Ignoble.</hi> I wonder what Law of Man, or what Patent ought to oblige me to make a Lye,<note place="margin">

                  </label> I anſwer, <hi>Charity</hi> deſtroys not <hi>Knowledge</hi>: I am not obliged by <hi>Charity,</hi> either to believe or ſpeak a <hi>Lye.</hi> Now it is apparent, and cannot be denied by any, but that thoſe Vertues are not in many of the Perſons, expreſſed by the Titles they bear; neither will they allow to ſpeak ſo to ſuch, in whom theſe Vertues are, unleſs they be ſo digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by outward Princes. So that ſuch as are truly Vertuous, muſt not be ſtiled by their Vertues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not priviledged by the Princes of this World; and ſuch as have them not, muſt be ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have obtained a Patent ſo to be: And all this is done by thoſe, who pretend to be his Followers, that commanded his Diſciples, <hi>not to be called of Men, Maſter</hi>; and told them, ſuch could <hi>not believe, as received Honour one from another, and ſought not the Honour which cometh from God only.</hi> This is ſo plain, to ſuch as will indeed be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that it needs no Conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to thoſe Titles of, <hi>Holineſs, Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Your Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> uſed among the Papiſts to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Grace, Lordſhip</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> uſed to the Clergy among the Proteſtants, it is a moſt Blaſphemous Uſurpation. For if they uſe <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> becauſe theſe things ought to be in a Pope or in a Biſhop, how come they to uſurp that peculiarly to themſelves? Ought not Holineſs and Grace to be in every Chriſtian? And ſo every Chriſtian ſhould ſay, <hi>Your Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Your Grace,</hi> one to another. <hi>Next,</hi> how can they in reaſon claim any more Titles than were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed and received by the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, whoſe Succeſſors they pretend they are and as whoſe Succeſſors (and no otherwiſe) them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I judge, will confeſs any Honour they ſeek is due to them. Now if they neither ſought, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, not admitted ſuch Honour nor Titles, how came theſe by them? If they ſay, They did; let them prove it if they can: We find no ſuch thing
<pb n="521" facs="unknown:003129_0267_0FF0066624126BB8"/>
in the Scripture. The Chriſtians ſpeak to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles without any ſuch Denomination, neither ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, <hi>If it pleaſe Your Grace, Your Holineſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hypocrites want Titles</note> 
                  <hi>Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> nor <hi>Your Worſhip</hi>; they are neither called, <hi>My Lord</hi> Peter, nor <hi>My Lord</hi> Paul; nor yet <hi>Maſter</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor <hi>Maſter</hi> Paul; nor <hi>Doctor</hi> Peter, nor <hi>Doctor</hi> Paul; but ſingly <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>; and that not only in the Scripture, but for ſome Hundreds of Years after: So that this appears to be a manifeſt Fruit of the Apoſtaſie. For if theſe <hi>Titles</hi> ariſe either from the <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Worth</hi> of the Perſons, it will not be denied, but the Apoſtles deſerved them better than any now, that call for them. But the Caſe is plain, the Apoſtles had the Holineſs, the Excellency, the Grace; and becauſe they were Holy, Excellent and Gracious, they neither uſed, nor admitted of ſuch Titles: But theſe having neither Holineſs, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency nor Grace, will needs be ſo called, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their ambitious and oſtentatious Mind, which is a manifeſt Token of their Hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As to that Title of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> uſually aſcribed to Princes, we do not find it given to any ſuch in the Holy Scripture; but that it is ſpecially and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly aſcribed unto God, as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11. <hi>Job</hi> 37.22. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 21.5. &amp; 29 4. &amp; 43.3. &amp; 63.1. &amp; 96.6. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.10. &amp; 24.14. &amp; 26.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. and many more places. Hence ſaith <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 25. <hi>To the only wiſe God, our Saviour, be Glory and Majeſty,</hi> &amp;c. not to Men. We find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the proud King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> aſſuming this Title to himſelf, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. who at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſufficient Reproof, by a ſudden Judgment which came upon him. Therefore in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations uſed to Princes in the Old Teſtament, it is not to be found, nor yet in the New. <hi>Paul</hi> was very civil to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> yet he gives him no ſuch Title: Neither was this Title uſed among Chriſtians in the Primitive Times. Hence the Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Reformaiion of <hi>France,</hi> relating the

let us examine, <hi>Who they are, that are Honourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?</hi> Is it not the Righteous Man?<note place="margin">1 Sam 2.30.</note> Is it not the Holy Man? Is it not the Humble hearted Man, the Meek-ſpirited Man? And are not ſuch thoſe that ought to be honoured among Chriſtians? Now, of theſe, may there not be poor Men, Labourers, filly Fiſher-Men? And if ſo, how comes it that the Titles of Honour are not beſtowed upon ſuch? But who are they that generally receive and look for this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Are they not the Rich Ones, ſuch as have abundance of the Earth, as be like the Rich Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſuch as are Proud and Ambitious, ſuch as are Oppreſſors of the Poor, ſuch as ſwell with Luſt and Vanity, and all Superfluity of Naughtineſs, who are the very Abomination and Plague of the Nations?

Men moſt Honourable, is <hi>Fighting,</hi> or ſome great <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Exploit,</hi> which can add nothing to a Chriſtian's Worth: Since, ſure it is, it were deſirable, there were no Fightings among Chriſtians at all; and in ſo far as there are, it ſhews they are not right Chriſtians. And <hi>James</hi> tells us, That <hi>Fighting proceeds from the Luſts</hi>; So that it were fitter for Chriſtians, by the <hi>Sword of God's Spirit,</hi> to fight againſt their Luſts, than by the Prevalancy of their Luſts, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another. Whatever Honour any might have attained of old, under the <hi>Law,</hi> this way; we find under the Goſpel Chriſtians commended for <hi>Suffering,</hi> not for <hi>Fighting</hi>; neither did any of <hi>Chriſt's Diſciples,</hi> ſave one, offer outward Violence by the Sword, in cutting off <hi>Malchus</hi>'s Ear; for which he received no Title of Honour, but a juſt Reproof.

               <p n="4">§. IV. Now beſides theſe general Titles of Honour, what groſs Abuſes are crept in among ſuch as are called Chriſtians, in the uſe of Complements, wherein not Servants to Maſters, or others, with reſpect to any ſuch kind of Relations, do ſay and write to one another at every turn, <hi>Your Humble Servant, Your most Obedient Servant,</hi> &amp;c. Such wicked Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms have, to the great prejudice of Souls, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Chriſtians to lye; and to uſe lying, is now come to be accounted Civility. O horrid Apoſtaſie! For it is notoriouſly known, that the uſe of theſe Complements imports not any deſign of Service, neither are any ſuch Fools to think ſo; for if we ſhould put them to it, that ſay ſo, they would not doubt to think, we abuſed them; and would let us know, they gave us words in courſe, and no more.

And of Old the ſame was uſed to</hi> Alexanders, Caeſars, Queens <hi>and</hi> Empreſſes. <hi>The uſe of the word</hi> You, <hi>when One Perſon is ſpoken to, was only introduced by theſe baſe Flatteries of Men of latter Ages, to whom it ſeemed good to uſe the Plural Number to One Perſon, that he may imagine himſelf alone to be equal to many other, in Dignity and Worth; from whence at laſt it came to Perſons of lower Quality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſame Purpoſe ſpeaketh alſo <hi>M. Godeau,</hi> in his Preface to the New Teſtament Tranſlation: <hi>I had rather</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>faithfully keep to the expreſs words of</hi> Paul, <hi>than exactly follow the poliſhed Stile of our Tongue; therefore I always uſe that form of calling God in the</hi> Singular Number, <hi>not in the</hi> Plural; <hi>and therefore I ſay rather</hi> Thou <hi>than</hi> You. <hi>I confeſs indeed, that</hi> Civility <hi>and</hi> Cuſtom of this World <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him to be honoured after that manner; but it is likewiſe on the contrary true, That the</hi> Original Tongue <hi>of the New Teſtament has nothing common with ſuch Manners and Civility; ſo that not one of theſe many Old Verſions we have, doth obſerve it. Let not Men believe, that we give not reſpect enough to God, in that we call him by the word</hi> Thou,<note place="margin">The <hi>word Thou,</hi> a greater Honour to One, than <hi>You.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>which is nevertheleſs far otherwiſe; for I ſeem to my ſelf (may be by the effect of Cuſtom) more to honour his Divine Majeſty, in calling him after this manner, than if I ſhould call him after the manners of Men, who are ſo delicate in their forms of Speech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See how clearly and evidently theſe Men wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that this Form of Speaking, and theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Titles, derive their Origin from the baſe Flattery of theſe laſt Ages, and from the delicate
<pb n="528" facs="unknown:003129_0271_0FF00670C5B672B8"/>
Haughtineſs of Worldly Men who have invented theſe Novelties, that thereby they might Honour one another, under I know not what pretence of Civility and Reſpect. From whence many of the preſent Chriſtians (ſo accounted) are become ſo Perverſe, in commending moſt wicked Men, and wicked Cuſtoms, that the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is wholly loſt; ſo that the giving of Men and Things their own Names, is not only worn out of Cuſtom, but the doing thereof is accounted Abſurd and Rude, by ſuch kind of delicate Paraſites, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to aſcribe to this Flattery, and abuſe the Name of Civility. Moreover, that this way of ſpeaking proceeds from a high and proud Mind, hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; becauſe that Men commonly uſe the Singular Number to Beggars, and to their Servants; yea, and in their Prayers to God. Thus the Superiour will ſpeak to his Inferiour, who yet will not bear, that the Inferiour ſo ſpeak to him, as judging it a kind of Reproach unto him. So hath the Pride of Men placed God and the Beggar in the ſame Category. I think I need not uſe Arguments, to prove to ſuch as know Congruous Language, that we ought to uſe the Singular Number ſpeaking to One; which is the common Dialect of the whole Scripture, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the moſt Interpreters do tranſlate it. Seeing therefore it is manifeſt to us, that this Form of ſpeaking to Men in the Plural Number, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Pride, as well as that it is in it ſelf a Lye, we found a neceſſity upon us, to teſtifie againſt this Corruption, by uſing the Singular equally unto All. And albeit no Reaſon can be given, why we ſhould be Perſecuted upon this account, eſpecially by Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Scripture-Dialect, the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to them thus in the Singular Number: Whereby we are the more Confirmed our Judgment, as ſeeing that this Teſtimony of Truth, which God hath given us to bear in all things, doth ſo vex the Serpentine Nature in the Children of Darkneſs.</p>

                  </note> the other Part of Honour, uſed among Chriſtians, is the <hi>Kneeling, Bowing,</hi> and <hi>Uncovering of the Head,</hi> to one another. I know nothing our Adverſaries have to plead for them in this matter, ſave ſome few Inſtances of the Old Teſtament, and the Cuſtom of the Country.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> are, ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>bowing himſelf to the Children of</hi> Heth, <hi>and</hi> Lot <hi>to the two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But the Practice of theſe Patriarchs, related <hi>as</hi> matter of Fact, are not to be a Rule to Chriſtians now? Neither are we to imitate them in every Practice, which has not a particular Reproof ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it: For we find not <hi>Abraham</hi> reproved for taking <hi>Hagar,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed to ſay, all things were lawful to us, which they practiſed, would produce great Inconveniences,<note place="margin">The Cuſtom of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no Rule to Christians.</note> obvious enough to all. And as to the Cuſtoms of the Nations, it's a very ill Argument for a Chriſtian's Practice: We ſhould have a better Rule to walk by, than the Cuſtom of the Gentiles; the Apoſtles deſire us, not to be <hi>conformed to this World,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.2.</note> We ſee how little they have to ſay for themſelves in this matter. Let it be obſerved then, whether our Reaſons for laying aſide theſe things, be not conſiderable, and weighty enough to uphold us in ſo doing.</p>
               <p>

                     </gap> only due to God.</note> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of the Head, is the alone outward ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Adoration towards God, <hi>and therefore
<pb n="530" facs="unknown:003129_0272_0FF00672645BC128"/>
it is not lawful to give it unto Man.</hi> He that kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or proſtrates himſelf to Man, what doth he more to God? He that boweth, and uncovereth his Head to the Creature, what hath he reſerved to the Creator? Now the Apoſtle ſhews us, that the <hi>un overing of the Head</hi> is that, which God requires of us in our worſhipping of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. But if we make our Addreſs to Men in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where lieth the difference? Not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Signification,</hi> but meerly in the <hi>Intention</hi>; which opens a door for the Popiſh Veneration of Images, which hereby is neceſſarily excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly; Men, being alike by Creation,</hi> (tho' their being ſtated under their ſeveral Relations, requires from them mutual Services, according to thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Relations) <hi>owe not Worſhip to one another, but all equally are to return it to God: Becauſe it is to him, and his Name alone, that every Knee muſt bow, and before whoſe Throne the four &amp; Twenty Elders proſtrate themſelves.</hi> Therefore for Men, to take this one from another, is to rob God of his Glory: Since all the duties of Relations may be performed one to another, without theſe kind of Bowings, which therefore are no eſſential part of our Duty to Man, but to God. All Men, by an inward inſtinct, in all Nations, have been led to proſtrate and bow themſelves to God. And it is plain, that this Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Men took place from a <hi>ſlaviſh fear</hi> poſſeſſing ſome, which led them to ſet up others as Gods; when alſo an ambitious proud Spirit got up in thoſe others, to uſurp the place of God, over their Brethren.</p>

Theſe things being thus conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is remitted to the Judgment of ſuch, as are deſirous to be found Chriſtians indeed, whether we be found worthy of blame, for waving it to Men.

And foraſmuch as they accuſe us herein of <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> tho' the Teſtimony of our Conſciences, in the fight of God, be a ſufficient Guard againſt ſuch Calumnies; yet there are of us, known to be Men of ſuch Education, as forbear not theſe things for want of that they call <hi>good Breeding</hi>; and we ſhould be very void of Reaſon, to purchaſe that Pride at ſo dear a Rate, as many have done the Exerciſe of their Conſcience in this matter; many of us having been ſorely Beaten and Buffetted; yea, and ſeveral Months Impriſoned, for no other Reaſon, but becauſe we could not ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the <hi>proud unreaſonable Humors of proud Men,</hi> as to <hi>uncover our Head,</hi> and <hi>bow our bodies.</hi> Nor doth our innocent Practice, in ſtanding ſtill, tho' upright, not puting off our Hats, any more than our <hi>Shoes,</hi> the one being the Covering of our <hi>Heads,</hi>

as well as the other of our <hi>Feet,</hi> ſhew ſo much Rudeneſs, as their Beating or Knocking us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe we cannot Bow to them, contrary to our Conſciences, which certainly ſhews leſs <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> upon their part, than it doth of <hi>Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>Pride</hi> upon ours. Now, ſuppoſe it were our Weakneſs, and we really under a Miſtake in this thing, ſince it is not alledged to be the breach of any Chriſtian Precept; are we not to be indulged, as the Apoſtle commanded ſhould be done to ſuch, as ſcrupled to <hi>eat Fleſh?</hi> And doth not Perſecuting and Reviling us upon this account, ſhew them to be more like unto proud <hi>Haman,</hi> than the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Followers of the <hi>Meek Self-denying Jeſus?</hi> And this I can ſay boldly, in the ſight of God, from my own Experience, and that of many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more, That however ſmall or ſo fooliſh this may ſeem, yet we behoved to chooſe Death, rather than do it, and that for Conſcience ſake: And that, in its being ſo contrary to our Natural Spirits, there are many of us, to whom the forſaking of theſe Bowings and Ceremonies, was as Death it ſelf: Which we could never have left, if we could have enjoyed our Peace with God, in the uſe of them. <hi>Tho it be far from us to judge all thoſe, to whom God hath not ſhewn the evil of them, under the like hazard</hi>; yet nevertheleſs, we doubt not, but to ſuch as would prove <hi>faithful Witneſſes to Chriſt's Divine Light in their Conſciences,</hi> God will alſo ſhew the Evil of theſe things.</p>

                     <hi>Apparel,</hi> in its Vanity and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed.</note>§. VII. The Third thing to be treated of, is the <hi>Vanity and Superflaity of Apparel.</hi> In which <hi>firſt,</hi> two things are to be conſidered; the <hi>Condition of the Perſon,</hi> and the <hi>Country he lives in.</hi> We ſhall not ſay, that all Perſons are to be cloathed alike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will perhaps neither ſuit their Bodies nor their Eſtates. And if a Man be cloathed <hi>ſoberly,</hi> and without <hi>Superfluity,</hi> tho' they may be <hi>finer</hi> than that which his Servant is cloathed with, we ſhall
<pb n="533" facs="unknown:003129_0273_0FF00675932A43E8"/>
not blame him for it: The abſtaining from Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, which his Condition and Education have accuſtomed him to, may be in him a greater Act of Mortification, than the abſtaining from finer Cloaths in the Servant, who was never accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. As to the Country, what it naturally produces, may be no Vanity to the Inhabitants to uſe, or what is commonly imparted to them by way of Exchange; ſeeing it is without doubt, that the Creation is for the uſe of Man. So where Silk abounds, it may be worn, as well as Wool; and were we in thoſe Countries, or near unto them, where <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> were as common as <hi>Iron</hi> or <hi>Braſs,</hi> the one might be uſed as well as the other. The Iniquity then lies here, <hi>Firſt,</hi> When from a luſt of Vanity, and deſire to Adorn themſelves, Men and Women, not content with what their Condition can bear, or their Country eaſily affords, do ſtretch to have things, that from their Rarity, and the Price that's put upon them, ſeem to be precious; and ſo feed their Luſt the more: And this all ſober Men of all ſorts will readily grant to be Evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi>; When Men are not content to make a true uſe of the Creation, whether the things be <hi>fine</hi> or <hi>courſe,</hi> and do not ſatisfie themſelves with what Need and Conveniency call for; but add thereunto things meerly <hi>ſuperfluous</hi>; ſuch as is the uſe of <hi>Ribbands</hi> and <hi>Lace,</hi> and much more of that kind of ſtuff, as <hi>painting the Face, plaiting the Hair,</hi> which are the Fruits of the <hi>first, luſtful</hi> and <hi>corrupt Nature,</hi> and not of the <hi>new Creation,</hi> as all will acknowledge. And tho' ſober Men, among all ſorts, will ſay, That it were better theſe things were not; yet will they not reckon them unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore do admit the uſe of them among their Church-Members. But we do account them altogether unlawful, and unſuitable to Chriſtians, and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <pb n="534" facs="unknown:003129_0274_0FF0067733326260"/>
               <p>Firſt; <hi>The uſe of Cloaths came originally from the Fall</hi>· If Man had not fallen,<note place="margin">The proper Uſe of Cloaths.</note> it appear he would not have needed them. But this miſerable State made them neceſſary in two reſpects: 1. <hi>To cover his Nakedneſs.</hi> 2. <hi>To keep them from the Cold</hi>; which are both the proper and principal Uſe of them. Now for Man to delight himſelf in that, which is the fruit of his Iniquity, and the conſequence of Sin, can be no ways lawful for him: So to extend things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their real uſe, or to ſuperadd things wholly ſuperfluous, is a manifeſt Abuſe of the Creation, and therefore not lawful to Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Thoſe that will needs ſo adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the uſe of their Cloaths, as to beſet them with things having no real uſe or neceſſity, but meerly for Ornament's ſake, do openly declare, That the End of it is either to pleaſe their <hi>Lust,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Not to pleaſe their Luſts.</note> (for which end theſe things are chiefly invented and contrived or otherwiſe to gratifie a <hi>vain, proud and ostentatious Mind</hi>; and it is obvious, theſe are their general Ends in ſo doing. Yea, we ſee, how eaſily Men are puff'd up with their Garments, and how proud and vain they are, when adorned to their Mind. Now how far theſe things are below a true Chriſtian, and how unſuitable, it needs not great probation. Hereby thoſe that love to be <hi>gaudy</hi> and <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> in their Cloaths, ſhew they concern themſelves little with Mortification and Self denial, and that they mind to beautify their Bodies more than their Souls; which prove their Minds are little upon Mortality, and ſo certainly are more nominal, than real Chriſtians.</p>

in theſe things, from whom a more ſtrict and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Converſation is required? Chriſt deſires us not to be <hi>anxious</hi> about our Cloathing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25. and to ſhew the Vanity of ſuch, as glory in the Splendor of their Cloathing, tells them, <hi>That even</hi> Solomon, <hi>in all his Glory, was not to be compared to the Lilly of the Field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the Oven.</hi> But ſurely, they make ſmall reckoning of Chriſt's Words and Doctrine, that are ſo curious in their Cloathing, and ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to deck themſelves, and ſo earneſt to juſtifie it, and ſo mad when they are reproved for it. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is very poſitive in this reſpect, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. <hi>I will therefore in like manner alſo, that Women adorn themſelves in modeſt Apparel, with ſhame-facedneſs and ſobriety; not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or coſtly Arr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here both the Apoſtles do very poſitively and expreſly aſſert two things, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the adorning of <hi>Chriſtian Women</hi> (of whom it is particularly ſpoken, judge, becauſe that Sex is moſt naturally inclined to that Vanity; and that it ſeems, that <hi>Chriſtian Men</hi> in thoſe days deſerved not, in this reſpect, ſo much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved) ought not to be outward, nor conſiſt in the Apparel. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they ought not to uſe <hi>Plaiting of the Hair,</hi> or <hi>Ornaments,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plaiting the Hair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> &amp;c. which was at that time the Cuſtom of the Nations. But is it not ſtrange, that ſuch as make the Scripture their Rule, and pretend they are guided by it, ſhould not only be ſo frequently and ordinarily in the uſe of theſe things, which the Scripture ſo plainly condemns; but alſo ſhould allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="536" facs="unknown:003129_0275_0FF00678ECDFA7D8"/>
in ſo doing?

Doth this bear any proportion to Chriſtianity? Do theſe things look any thing like the Churches of the Primitive Chriſtians? Surely not at all. I ſhall firſt cite ſome few <hi>Scripture Teſtimonies,</hi> being very poſitive Precepts to Chriſtians, and then ſee, whether ſuch as obey them, can admit of theſe fore mentioned things. The Apoſtle commands us, That <hi>whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we do it all to the Glory of God.</hi> But I judge none will be ſo impudent,<note place="margin">By Sports and Games God is not glorified?</note> as to affirm, That in the uſe of theſe <hi>Sports</hi> and <hi>Games</hi> God is glorified: If any ſhould ſo ſay, they would declare, they neither knew God, nor his Glory. And Experience abundantly proves, that in the Practice of theſe things, Men mind nothing leſs, than the Glory of God; and nothing more, than the Satisfaction of their own <hi>carnal Luſts, Wills</hi> and <hi>Appetites.</hi> The Apoſtle deſires us, 1 Cor. 7.29, 31. <hi>Becauſe the time is ſhort, that they that buy, ſhould be as tho' they poſſeſſed not: And they that uſe this World, as not abuſing it,</hi> &amp;c.

Who, it ſeems, think the time ſo long, that they cannot find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion enough to employ it, neither in taking care for their Souls, nor yet in the neceſſary care for their Bodies; but invent theſe Games and Sports to paſs it away, as if they wanted other Work to ſerve God, or be uſeful to the Creation in. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> deſires us, <hi>To paſs the time of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17.

And albeit ſuch a one muſt be converſant in thoſe things,<note place="margin">The Love towards its Beloved ſhuns its Offence.</note> that the Care of this Body, and ſuch like things call for; yet will he avoid, as Death it ſelf, to do thoſe things, that may offend the Party ſo beloved, or croſs his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in obtaining the thing ſo earneſtly deſired: Tho' there may be ſome ſmall uſe in them; the great Deſign, which is chiefly in his Eye, will ſo ballance him, that he will eaſily look over and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with ſuch petty Neceſſities, rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the loſs of the greater by them.

by any other Oath: But let your Yea, be Yea, and your Nay, Nay; leſt ye fall into Condemnation.</hi> I ſay, conſidering theſe clear words, it is admirable how any one, that profeſſeth the Name of Chriſt, can pronounce any Oath with a quiet Conſcience; far leſs to perſecute other Chriſtians, that dare not Swear, becauſe of their Maſter Chriſt his Authority. For did any one purpoſe ſeriouſly, and in the moſt rigid manner, to forbid any thing, comprehended under any General, can they uſe a more full and general Prohibition, and that without any Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I think not. For Chriſt, <hi>First,</hi> propoſeth it to us Negatively, <hi>Swear not at all, neither by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor by the Earth, nor by</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>nor by thy Head,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>Which words, both all and every one of them,<note place="margin">Without Exception.</note> do make ſuch a full Prohibition, and ſo free of all Exception, that it is ſtrange how Men, that boaſt the Scripture is the Rule of their <hi>Faith and Life,</hi> can counterfeit any Exception! Certainly <hi>Reaſon</hi> ought to teach every one, that it is not lawful to make void a general Prohibition, coming from God, by ſuch oppoſition; unleſs the Exception be as clearly and evidently expreſſed, as the Prohibition: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it enough, to endeavour to confirm it by Conſequences and Probabilites, which are obſcure and uncertain, and not ſufficient to bring quiet to the Conſcience. For if they ſay, that there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Exception and Limitation in the words, becauſe there are found Exceptions in the other general Prohibition of this fifth Chapter, as in the forbidding of Divorcement, where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It hath been ſaid, Whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, let him give her a Writing of Divorcement. But I ſay
<pb n="544" facs="unknown:003129_0279_0FF0068372966C98"/>
unto you, That whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife ſaving for the cauſe of Fornication, cauſeth her to commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:</hi> If (I ſay) they plead this, they not only labour in vain, but alſo fight againſt themſelves, becauſe they can produce no Exception of this general Command of <hi>not Swearing,</hi> expreſſed by God to any under the New Covenant, after Chriſt give this Prohibition, ſo clear as that, which is made in the Prohibition it ſelf. Moreover, if Chriſt would have excepted Oaths,<note place="margin">Alſo Oaths before a Magiſtrate</note> made before Magiſtrates, certainly he had then expreſſed, adding, <hi>Except in Judgment, before the Migiſtrate,</hi> or the like; as he did in that of Divorcement, by theſe words, <hi>Saving for the cauſe of Fornication</hi>: Which being ſo, it is not lawful for us to <hi>except</hi> or <hi>diſtinguiſh,</hi> or (which is all one) <hi>make void</hi> this general Prohibition of Chriſt; it would be far leſs agreeable to Chriſtian Holineſs, to bring upon our Heads the Crimes of ſo many Oaths, which by reaſon of this Corruption and Exception, are ſo frequent among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be omitted, that without doubt, the moſt Learned Doctors of each Sect know, that theſe fore mentioned words were underſtood by the Ancient Fathers of the <hi>first Three Hundred Years</hi> after Chriſt, to be a Prohibition of all ſorts of Oaths.

themſelves, or lawful at that time, after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt; but becauſe that Spirit was not yet raiſed up in them, whereby they could be delivered from ſuch Rudiments: So the preſent Confeſſors of the Chriſtian Name, who are yet in the mixture, and not in the patient Suffering Spirit, are not yet fitted for this form of Chriſtianity, and therefore cannot be undefending themſelves, until they attain that Perfection.

if theſe be the Ornaments of Chriſtians; and if that be to be Humble, Meek and Mortified; Then are our Adverſaries good Chriſtians indeed, and we Proud, Singular and Conceited, in contenting our ſelves with what Need and Conveniency calls for, and condemning what is more, as Superfluous; but not otherwiſe. If to uſe Games, Sports, Plays; if to Card, Dice and Dance; if to Sing, Fiddle and Pipe; if to uſe Stage Plays and Comedies, and to Lye, Counterfeit and Diſſemble, be to Fear always; and if that be to do all things to the Glory of God; and if that be to paſs our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here in Fear; and if that be to uſe this World, as if we did not uſe it; and if that be not to faſhion our ſelves according to our former Luſts; to be not conformable to the Spirit and vain Converſation of this World; Then are our Adverſaries, notwithſtanding they uſe theſe things, and plead for them, very Good, Sober, Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Self-denying Chriſtians, and we juſtly to be blamed for judging them; but not otherwiſe.

If to Revenge our ſelves, or to render Injury, Evil for Evil, Wound for Wound, to take Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth; if to Fight for outward and periſhing things, to go a Warring one againſt another, whom we never ſaw, nor with whom we never had any Conteſt, nor any thing to do; being moreover altogether ignorant of the cauſe of the War, but only, that

the Magiſtrates of the Nations foment Quarrels one againſt another, the Cauſes whereof are for the moſt part unknown to the Soldiers that fight, as well as upon whoſe ſide the Right or Wrong is; and yet to be ſo furious, and rage one againſt another, to deſtroy and ſpoil all, that this or the other Worſhip may be received or aboliſhed; If to do this, and much more of this kind, be to fulfil the Law of Chriſt, then are our Adverſaries indeed true Chriſtians, and we miſerable Hereticks, that ſuffer our ſelves to be Spoiled, Taken, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, Baniſhed, Beaten, and evilly Entreated, without any Reſiſtance, <hi>placing our truſt only in</hi> GOD, that he may defend us, and lead us by the way of the Croſs unto his Kingdom.

            <head>The <hi>CONCLUSION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IF in God's Fear, <hi>Candid Reader,</hi> thou applyeſt thy ſelf to conſider this Syſtem of Religion, here delivered, with its Conſiſtency and Harmony, as well in it ſelf, as with the Scriptures of Truth, I doubt not, but thou wilt ſay with me, and many more, That this is the Spiritual Day of Chriſt's Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, wherein he is again Revealing the Ancient Paths of Truth and Righteouſneſs. For thou may'ſt obſerve here the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> in all its parts, truly Eſtabliſhed and Vindicated, as it is a Living, Inward, Spiritual, Pure and Subſtantial Thing; and not a meer Form, Shew, Shadow, Notion and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, as too many have hitherto held it, whoſe Fruits declare, they wanted that which they bear the Name of: And yet many of thoſe are ſo in love with their empty Forms and Shadows, that they ceaſe not to calumniate us for commending, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to the Subſtance; as if we therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied or neglected the true Form and outward Part of Chriſtianity, which indeed is (as God, the Searcher of Hearts, knows) a very great Slander. Thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have deſired People earneſtly to feel after God <hi>near,</hi> and <hi>in themſelves,</hi> telling them, That their Notions of God, as he is beyond the Clouds, will little avail them, if they do not feel him near: Hence they have ſought maliciouſly to infer, that we deny any God, except that which is within us. Becauſe we tell People, That it is the <hi>Light</hi> and the <hi>Law within,</hi> and not the <hi>Letter without,</hi> that can truly tell them their Condition, and lead them out
<pb n="573" facs="unknown:003129_0293_0FF006A4E074D298"/>
of all Evil: Hence they ſay, we vilifie the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſet up our own Imaginations above them. Becauſe we tell them, That it is not their talking or believing of Chriſt's outward Life, Sufferings, Death and Reſurrection, no more than the <hi>Jews</hi> crying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> that will ſerve their turn, or juſtify them in the ſight of God; but that they muſt know <hi>Chriſt in them,</hi> whom they have crucified, to be raiſed, and to juſtifie them and redeem them from their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: Hence they ſay, We deny the Life, Death and Sufferings of Chriſt, Juſtification by his Blood, and Remiſſion of Sins through him. Becauſe we tell them, while they are talking and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining about the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> that they have more need to know the <hi>Juſt One,</hi> whom they have ſlain, <hi>raiſed in themſelves,</hi> and to be ſure they are Partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the <hi>firſt Reſurrection</hi>; and that if this be, they will be the more capable to judge of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>: Hence they ſay, That we deny the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body. Becauſe, when we hear them talk fooliſhly of Heaven and Hell, and the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we exhort them to come out of that Helliſh Condition they are in, and come down to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt <hi>in their own Hearts,</hi> and believe in the Light, and follow it, that ſo they may come to ſit in the <hi>heavenly places,</hi> that are in Chriſt Jeſus: Hence they maliciouſly ſay, That we deny any Heaven or Hell, but that which is within us, and that we deny any general Judgment: Which <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> the Lord knows, are foully caſt upon us, whom God hath raiſed for this end, and gathered us, that by us he might confound the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and bring to nought the Underſtanding of the Prudent; and might, in and by his own Spirit and Power in a deſpiſed People, (that no Fleſh might glory in his preſence) pull down that dead, dark, corrupt Image, and meer Shadow and Shell of Chriſtianity, wherewith Antichriſt hath deceived

It is Univerſal. God gave his only Begotten Son, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for a Light that whoſoever believeth in him may be ſaved, 109.160, 161. The Benefit of his Death is not leſs Univerſal, than the Seed of Sin, 108, 109. There is ſcarce found any Article of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that is ſo expreſly confirmed in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 118 to 125, This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was preached by the Fathers (ſo called) of the firſt ſix hundred years, and is proved by the Sayings of ſome, 125, 126, 127. Thoſe that ſince the time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, have affirmed it, have not given a clear Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, how that Benefit is communicated to all; nor have ſufficiently taught the Truth, becauſe they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the abſolute neceſſity of the <hi>outward</hi> Knowledge of the Hiſtory of Chriſt; yea, they have thereby given the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary party a ſtronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to defend their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe decree of Reprobation; among whom were the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants of <hi>Holland,</hi> 110, 127 to 130. God hath now raſed up a few Illiterate Men to be diſpenſers of this Truth, 131, 132, 180, 181. This Doctrine ſheweth forth the Mercy and Juſtice of God, 133, 151, 152.

and the Freedom of Man's Will 124.

There is given to every one (none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) a certain Day and Time of Viſitation, in which it is poſſible for them to be ſaved, 132, 153 to 160.
