            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN a true and living Remembrance of this our dear Brother, ancient and faithful Servant and Miniſter of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Richard Davies,</hi> and of that dear and brotherly Love, which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between us, and which he had to all faithful Friends and Brethren in Chriſt; I am concern'd to give this brief Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in Commemoration of him, his Life, and faithful Goſpel Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>He was not only a Profeſſor of the Name, Power and Spirit of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo made a Partaker of Chriſt in Spirit, Life and Converſation: A plain, meek and humble Man of Integrity; a Man fearing God, and hating Iniquity; a Man ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Holy Spirit, unto unfeigned and conſtant Love of his Brethren in Chriſt; a Man ſound in Faith, in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Charity, of a ſound Mind and
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0003_102A5F03DF934850"/>Judgment, being endued with a Spirit of Love: He was a Preacher of Chriſt, and His Righteouſneſs in Converſation, as well as in Doctrine and Miniſtry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was examplary to the Believers, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> He was given up to ſerve the Truth and Friends; and being of a tender Spirit, did truly ſympathize with the Sufferers for the ſame, and uſed his induſtrious Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yours for their Relief, where he could have an Intereſt or Place with ſuch as had Power.</p>
            <p>His Teſtimony and Miniſtry was evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, plain and ſound; not in Words of Man's Wiſdom, but in the Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and plain Evidence of the Holy Spirit and Power of Chriſt: Being a Miniſter of the Spirit, and of the New Teſtament; the New Covenant Diſpenſation, which ſtands not in legal Shadows, Types, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Signs or Figures, but in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Life and Subſtance, even in Chriſt Jeſus, in whom all the Shadows, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations thereof, are ended.</p>
            <p>And this our dear Brother having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through and beyond thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſpenſations, Shadows and Vails; and underſtanding their Ceſſation Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val and End, in and by Chriſt Jeſus, his Sufferings and Death; and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by His inward and ſpiritual Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Diſpenſation and Work in his Heart and Soul; whereby he was ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e ſenſible of the Power of Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as being one riſen with Him: By the Brightneſs and Glory of whoſe Day, the Shadows naturally vaniſh and flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; as this faithful Miniſter of Chriſt was Witneſs, with many more of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who were and are Partakers of the inward and ſpiritual Revelation of the Myſtery of Chriſt, and of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Day.</p>
            <p>And as this Goſpel-Miniſter did ſee and partake of the enduring Subſtance, and End of all vaniſhing Shadows, and carnal Ordinances; he well knew, that neither <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm with Water, nor any outward Waſhings therewith (tho' once commanded) could ever ſanctify or waſh the Inſide from Siri and Pollution, or ſprinkle and purify the Conſcience, or make a true Chriſtian; much leſs can Sprinkling Infan's which God never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: But Chriſt's ſpiritual Baptiſm, and Waſhing of Regeneration by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life, which is the One Baptiſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Baptiſm of the Spirit; this is the only ſaving Baptiſm, as our ſaid deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0004_102A5F0564AE2AD0"/>Brother hath teſtified, according to Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>He alſo likewiſe teſtified, that outward Bread and Wine cannot feed nor nouriſh the immortal Soul, or inward Man (any more than the legal Paſſover) but only the Body, or outward Man: But Chriſt, the Living Bread, the Bread of Life, which comes down from Heaven; and the Cup of Bleſſing, which he gives to his ſpiritual Communicants; He being that ſpiritual Meat and Drink, which all His ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> partake of in this his Goſpel Day, to their great Refreſhment and Comfort, in the ſpiritual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and comfortable Fellowſhip of his Holy Spirit.

            <p>And I am fully perſwaded, That as this our dear and well-beloved Friend and Brother, <hi>R.

               <hi>A ſhort Teſtimony concerning my dear and loving Father,</hi> Richard Davies, <hi>whom God, in his Mercy, took to Himſelf, the 22d Day of the</hi> Firſt Month, 1707-8. <hi>He being about 72 Years, and Eleven Months old.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Can truly ſay, he was a dear and tender Father to me, in my young Years; and as I grew up, I had a Senſe of his great Love and Care over me, and it ſeized my Heart, ſo that I often pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God that he would keep me from offending ſo good a Father. And when
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0005_102A5F07BA279A90"/>I was capable of travelling with him, he uſually took me along with him, in his Journeys to <hi>London,</hi> and elſewhere: Many were the good Opportunities we had in travelling together, and viſiting Friends at their Meetings.</p>
            <p>And as his Care was to me, ſo was it over mine alſo, which makes our Loſs the greater; but I am ſatisfied it is his great Gain. Oh! how often and fervent would be pray to the Almighty, that his Children might become the Children of the Lord, and that he might keep us from the Allurements and Defilements of this wicked World: And we hope the Lord will anſwer his Petitions on our Behalf.</p>
            <p>My dear Father was ſerviceable to moſt Sorts of People, rich and poor, in the Country where he lived, and in other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laces. He was ready to give his Advice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Counſel freely, both in Things relating to the Law, or the Goſpel; and he had much Place and Intereſt with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great Perſons, and what he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them, was generally granted him. And I may ſay it to the Praiſe of the Lord, he was well reſpected by moſt Sorts of People, and the Loſs of him is known amongſt them?</p>
            <p>He was very ready to ſerve the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and Fatherleſs, in what lay in his Power; and many were his Labours, and Travels of Love: But now he is ceaſed from them all, and I queſtion not but he is gone to his Eternal Reſt with God for ever. It is my Deſire, that we may prize the great Goodneſs and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindneſs of the Lord, in ſparing of him ſo long unto us, for he had been but a weakly Man of Body theſe late Years.</p>
            <p>About the 10th Month, 1688, my dear Father was ſick and weak, ſo that moſt that ſaw him, thought he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover: But the Lord in his tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ordered our dear Friend <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> and <hi>Robert Haydock</hi> to come into theſe Parts to viſit Friends, and they came to our Houſe at <hi>Welſh-Pool,</hi> and they had a Meeting there; and as they were parting with my Father, they had it in their Hearts to pray, and they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly interceded with the Lord, <hi>That is might ſtand good with His Will, to ſpare him again unto us;</hi> for we were then a ſorrowful Family. Afterwards. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member very well, dear <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> ſpoke, and ſaid to my Father, <q>Dear <hi>Richard,</hi> thou art a very weak Man, in the Sight of thoſe that ſee thee, and
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0006_102A5F095842BD38"/>not likely to live many Hours, as to ſhe natural Man's thinking; but the Lord has given it me at this Time to believe, I ſhall ſee thee at our next Yearly-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>London.</hi>
               </q> When I heard theſe Words, it was joyful News to me, and it proved very true, the Lord in his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Mercy, and Loving kindneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him to his Health, and next Spring He went to the Yearly-meeting at <hi>London,</hi> where alſo dear <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> was, and glad to ſee my Father there. This was all the Lord's Doings and His Works they are marvelous in our Eyes.</p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid; but my Deſire is, that as our ancient Friends, Fathers and Mothers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> have bore the Burthen in the Heat of the Day (through many Tribulations and Afflictions, and now have reſted from their Labours, and their Works follow them, and their Memorial is bleſſed for evermore) ſo that we alſo who are leſt, may walk in the Footſteps of the Flock, and tread in the Path they have trod in. It is, as to the outward, an eaſy Way now to what our Ancients had; but the Enemy and Adverſary of our immortal Souls is the ſame, and he is unwearied; therefore we ought to be very careful, and double
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0006_102A5F095842BD38"/>our Diligence, to be ſober and watchful, and cry inceſſantly to the Lord God of our Fathers, that he may be our God, and enable us to walk worthy of all His Mercies and Bleſſings, every Way, for they are many.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall give ſome Account of my dear Father's Departure. He was taken ill on the 6th Day of the Week, being the 19th of the Firſt Month, 1707-8. On the Firſt-day following, he ſent for ſome Friends of <hi>Dolobran</hi> Meeting, and ſeveral of them came to him, and had a Meeting with him in his Bed-Chamber; he deſired Friends to pray to the Lord, That <hi>he might have an eaſy Paſſage;</hi> adding, That <hi>the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayers of the Righteous, the Lord would have a Regard unto.</hi> And his Time being come, he departed this Life, as it were in a Sleep; and ſo, as he hath often ſaid, he went to ſleep his long Sleep, it being about the 9th Hour in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, the 22d of Firſt Month, 1707-8. And on the 25th following his Body was accompanied with a conſiderable Number of Friends and People to the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-place, near his own Houſe at <hi>Cloddiecochion,</hi> and there decently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd.</p>
            <p>

And now it is my Deſire, that all of us who have had ſuch good Examples by our Parents, may follow them in Purity and Holineſs; ſo that we may be ſuch good Patterns to our Off-ſpring, that when we lay down our Heads, and leave this natural Life, they may have cauſe to praiſe and glorify the Lord on our Account, as many of us can ſay we have had for our worthy Parents that are gone. And if we continue in well doing, and in the Fear of the Lord, there is no Queſtion but we ſhall die in his Favour, which I deſire may be the Lot of the whole Heritage of God.</p>

            <p>HE was one of the firſt of Friends in theſe Parts, who received the bleſſed Truth in the Love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it; and
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0007_102A5F0B34541288"/>he laboured much in the Morning and Heat of the Day.</p>
            <p>He and his Wife were very hearty, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, and ready to entertain Friends, their Hearts and Houſe being very open in that reſpect; and they were very helpful and ſerviceable to Friends in this Country, who were Priſoners on Truth's Account in <hi>Welſh-pool</hi> (the Place where they then lived) when there were but few other Friends of Ability to aſſiſt them, until the Lord raiſed up ſeveral other eminent Inſtruments in theſe Parts, who were ſerviceable with them.</p>
            <p>Our ſaid Friend was a wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man; he had a good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Capacity, and was a Man of great Experience; and he was very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to adviſe and counſel any in Things relating to the Goſpel and outward Affairs.</p>
            <p>And as he was diſcreet in his Conduct among Men, the Lord gave him great Place and Favour with ſeveral Perſons of Note, with whom he had often good Service for Truth and Friends.</p>
            <p>The Lord bleſſed him with a good Gift in the Miniſtry, and he was made an able Miniſter of the Goſpel, ſound in Judgment, and well received by moſt People who heard him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:006833_0008_102A5F0E4D564A98"/>
He travelled pretty much in divers Parts on Truth's Service, eſpecially in his younger Years, and had good Service in many Places where his Lot was caſt, both at Home and Abroad; he was often at <hi>London,</hi> where he was well eſteemed by many of our Elders and Brethren.</p>
            <p>He lived to a good old Age, and was favoured with a ſhort Sickneſs at laſt. Some of us were with him the Day before his Departure; and he ſeemed ſenſible that his End was near approaching, and he appeared as one that was waiting for the ſame. He departed this Life the 22d of the 1ſt Mon. 1707-8. in the 73d Year of his Age; and we believe he is at Reſt with the Lord, together with many more of the faithful Followers of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not enlarge much further, but refer to the enſuing Account of his Labours, Travels and Services, for Truth and Friends, on ſeveral Occaſions, which contains a general Relation of the moſt remarkable Occurrences and Paſſages of Life, which was written by himſelf, not long before his Deceaſe.</p>
            <p>And we earneſtly deſire, that all who make Profeſſion of the glorious Truth with us, may really know a <hi>working out of their alvation with Fear and
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0008_102A5F0E4D564A98"/>Trembling;</hi> and that they may faithfully improve their Talents in their Age and Time, and truly follow the Examples of the faithful Elders and Servants of the Lord, in all Things wherein they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt; That we may give our Account at laſt with Joy, and receive an eternal Reward, with the faithful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord, when Time in this World to us will be no more.</p>
            <p>So, <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth; yea, ſaith the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them,</hi> Rev. xiv. 13.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> Teſtimony <hi>of</hi> Rowland Owen, <hi>concerning his dear Friend</hi> Richard Davies, <hi>of</hi> Cloddiecochion, <hi>lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A Weighty Conſideration came upon my Mind, in a Senſe how the Almighty God, in his unſpeakable and unſearchable Wiſdom, who diſcerneth the States and Conditions of the Sons and Daughters of Men, making Choice of ſome, and calleth them from among their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Relations, to be ſerviceable unto him; amongſt whom our dear Friend RICHARD DAVIES was called ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Day of God's Viſitation to ſerve him, and he gave up in Obedience to the Lord, and took up the Croſs in a Time of great Perſecution, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Lord made him willing and obedient, in thoſe Days, to go abroad with a Publick Teſtimony for the Truth, and moved him to come to our County of MERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONETHSHIRE, when ſome of us were very young in Years; and it pleaſed the Lord to make him inſtrumental in his Hand to bring Glad-tidings to our Ears, and his Teſtimony was ſweet and comfortable, to the edifying and tendering of our Hearts and Souls. Many of us loved him exceedingly, and that Love remained between him and us till the End of his Days: He was tender and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over us, and a Nouriſher and Strengthener of ſome of us in our ſpiritual, Exerciſes, and was ready to aſiſt the Weak and Feeble, and willing to give a helping Hand, Counſel and Admonition to Friends and others, that had any Deſires to ſerve the Lord.</p>
            <p>O the wonderful Wiſdom and Love of God! who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and many others in thoſe Days, and prepared
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0009_102A5F126B12C778"/>and qualified them for the great Work he had to do, and ſtrengthened them to tread the Way before us, that were weak and feeble: O what ſtrong, bold and valiant Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did the Lord God prepare to begin to ſtrike at the great Image of Pride, Haughtineſs,, &amp;c. that was then, and yet is in the World! Indeed their Memorial is worthy to be recorded, that Ages yet to come might ſee what the Lord hath done for his faithful Ones, who gave up their Lives, and all they had, on Truth's Account.</p>
            <p>I was acquainted with our ſaid Friend for about Forty Years, and I can ſay of a Truth, That his Service was great in the Church of Chriſt, eſpecially in Times of Perſecution; he having much Intereſt with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and them in Authority in thoſe Days. And his Houſe was very open to entertain Friends to the utmoſt of his Ability; and the Lord bleſſed him.</p>
            <p>The Lord out of his Treaſure of Grace, eminently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued him, to hear a ſound and ſeaſonable Teſtimony, when great Aſſemblies and Multitudes of People were gathered together; and he had a ſkilful Hand to adminiſter unto them the Way of Truth, and to open it to their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; which many Times gave them great Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they were made to ſpeak well of Truth and its Followers. O the deep Senſe that remains upon me, of the great Want we have of the Service of ſuch as he was! The Lord, who in his Mercy, qualified and ſitted him, is able to prepare and raiſe up other faithful Labourers.</p>
            <p>It affects me, when I remember his Gravity and gray Hairs, his manly Preſence, and lovely Countenance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he ſtood up in a Meeting: Now he hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his Courſe, and, I believe, hath done his Day's Work, and is gone to his Eternal Reſt.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid on his Behalf, but I deſire that none may miſtake me, I am not giving Honour to Man, that is but Duſt and Aſhes; but that all might ſee how the Almighty God doth beſtow his ſpiritual Gifts upon thoſe whom he requireth Service at their Hands. And it is our Duty, as out Saviour Jeſus Chriſt adviſed his beloved Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, "To pray to the Lord of the Harveſt (which Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is great) that he would ſend forth more faithful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his Harveſt," that Mankind might be gathered into the inward Poſſeſſion and Subſtance of Chriſtianity,
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0010_102A5F1405199E48"/>which many outwardly profeſs; that the God of all our Mercies, and his beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt, may have all the Glory and Thankſgiving, to whom it belongs, not only now, but henceforth for ever, and for evermore, AMEN.</p>

               <hi>An Account of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement, Exerciſes, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Travels of that Ancient Servant of the Lord,</hi> Richard Davies.</head>
            <p>I Was born in the Year 1635, in the Town of <hi>Welch-pool,</hi> in <hi>Montgome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhire,</hi> in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> of honeſt Parents, that had a ſmall Eſtate there: I was brought up in a little Learning and in the Religion and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> When I came to be about Twelve or Thirteen Years of Age, the Lord put his Fear in my Heart, that I came to a Conſideration, if I ſhould die, what would become of my Soul, if I lived after the Way that ſome of my Companions did, and it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Heart to leave them; and I was inclined to go and hear Sermons, and followed the beſt of thoſe Sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006833_0011_102A5F1590040190"/>that I did believe did fear the Lord, which I then thought were the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> People, eſpecially one <hi>Vavaſor Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> who was a zealous Man in his Day and Time; he tock much Pains and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to gather a People into that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion; and many where gathered in theſe Parts to that Way; and I follow-them from one Pariſh to another, and from one Meeting to another, writing their Sermons, and in Time I came to repeat them to the People; and there, being exerciſed in the Hiſtorical Part of the scriptures, I could ſpeak and talk of them, ſo that thoſe People came to ſpeak well of me, and this did not a lit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> puff me up; ſo that I was not ſo ſerious as I ſhould have been to get Eternal Life by Chriſt Jeſus, who is tho Life him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who ſaid to the <hi>Jews, John</hi> v. 39, 40. <hi>Search</hi> (or <hi>ye ſearch</hi>) <hi>the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have Eternal Life, and they are they which teſtify of me: And ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were diligent in Searching the Scriptures, which was good in its Place; but the main Matter and Subſtance of pure Religion, is the Enjoyment of Eternal Life to the Soul from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006833_0011_102A5F1590040190"/>
About the Fourteenth Year of my Age, my Father intended to put me an Apprentice to a Shopkeeper, where I was for a Trial: But I ſaw that the Converſation of my intended Maſter was not right, and that the Fear of the Lord was not there; I was afraid that if I ſhould continue there, that the little Love and Zeal I had to God, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would be choak'd and quench'd in me, and the Love and Pleaſure of the World would get up again, ſo I ſhould be in Danger of growing worſe than ever; and being under theſe ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I heartily pray'd to God with Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Tears, what he put in my Heart to pray for, <hi>viz.</hi> That I might be delivered from that Place where I was intended to be bound an Apprentice, and that I might ſpend my Time with and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that feared the Lord, and tho't upon his Name; and the Lord heard my Players, and in a little Time I was ſent for away from that Place.</p>
            <p>After this I ſtaid at Home ſome Time, and continued in that little Well-doing I had known, keeping Company with ſober and honeſt People; I delighted to read the Scriptures and to go to the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Meetings. And after ſome Time.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006833_0012_102A5F1788783A68"/>I heard of a Man that profeſſed the ſame Religion, who was very zealous for a Time in going to Meetings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that which we call Family Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and there (with the Conſent of my Parents) I bound myſelf an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to him, whoſe Name was <hi>Evan Jones,</hi> a Feltmaker, in the Pariſh of <hi>Lanfair,</hi> in <hi>Montgomeryſhire;</hi> and we went together to Meetings, I writing and repeating Sormons, and performing that Cuſtom that was among us, in Praying in our own Will and Time, till we were become ſo dead and formal, carnal airy, and many looſe Words and Action growing up amongſt us, that I was gone out of Conceit with myſelf, and our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Religion; there being ſomething in me that reproved me for my Vanity; and when I aroſe from my Prayers, being ſometime in a weighty ponderous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I ſaw that there was ſomething that gave me no true Peace nor Comfort in wardly to my Soul, becauſe there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a ſecret Pride and Self-exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in moſt if not all our formal Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
            <p>In this State and Condition, I knew not what to do; when neither Writing, Repeating Sermons, Reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006833_0012_102A5F1788783A68"/>and other good Books, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Expounding of them, to the beſt of my Underſtanding afforded me any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I was at a Loſs, and knew not what Way to take, that I might have Peace and Comfort in my Performances. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I knew not the Holy Spirit of the Lord (as I ought to have done) to be my Leader and Guider into all Things that were neceſſary to my Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Upon a certain Time we had a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one <hi>Hugh Davids,</hi> a Tenant of <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi>'s of <hi>Dolobran,</hi> where one of our <hi>Independent</hi> Teachers (who was a great Scripturian) was Preaching, and I writ after him, and in his Sermon he ſaid, <hi>The Time would come, that there would be no need of the Scripture any more than another Book:</hi> At which I very much ſlumbled; and after the Meeting I asked him, when would that Time be? He ſaid, when the Lord would make a New Covenant with his People, as is ſaid in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> xxxi. 33, 34. <hi>I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after thoſe Days, faith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write is in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006833_0013_102A5F198C29E440"/>ſhall be my People. And they ſhall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them faith the Lord; for I will forgive their Iniquity, and I will remember their Sin no more.</hi> It ſeems that he knew not that Day come then, though he was a great Preacher. I thought it would then be a happy Day, when God would be the Teacher of his People himſelf; that we need not teach every Man his Neighbour, or his Brother, ſaying, <hi>Know ye the Lord;</hi> but that we ſhould all know Him, from the leaſt to the greateſt: This Day we knew not then, for all our Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and long Prayers; though the Lord did then beget true Hung'rings and Thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in our Souls after him: We had great Love and Zeal, and deſired the Knowledge of the Truth, as it was in Jeſus. Sometime I have ſaid, This was but like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Dream, when he awoke, he ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lord is in this Place, and I knew it not.</hi> And indeed we knew not the Lord as we ought to have done; namely, by his Light, Grace and Spirit ſhining in our Hearts, to give us the Light of the Knowledge of the Son
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006833_0013_102A5F198C29E440"/>of God, which Knowledge keeps a Man meek and humble, and ſuch are not puffed up in a vain Mind, to ſeek after thoſe Things that are too high for them, as too many are climbing up that Way, which is not the Way to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Way to the Father, is the Way of Holineſs and Purity, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord, nor enjoy his Preſence to their Comfort.</p>
            <p>About this Time, being in the Year 1656. our Miniſters told us, That there was a Sort of People come up in the <hi>North,</hi> called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that were a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a ſtrange Poſture and Principles, ſaying that it was the laſt Days and Times, that Chriſt ſpoke of in the 24th of <hi>Matthew,</hi> 
               <q>Many ſhall come in my Name, and deceive many (<hi>v.</hi> 5.) For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophers, and ſhall ſhew great Signs and Wonders, inſomuch that (if it were poſſible) they ſhall deceive the very Elect.</q> This Sort of People called <hi>Quakers</hi> were much preached againſt. They told us, they were the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they denied the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all Ordinances, and alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the very Chriſt that bought them;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006833_0014_102A5F1D4AAAE560"/>they were repreſented to us to be ſuch a dangerous Sort of People, that we were afraid of any who had the Name of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> leſt we ſhould be deceived by them: Hitherto they had not been in theſe Parts of the Country, neither did we know what were their Principles held out by themſelves; but only ſuch as were reported (tho' falſly) unto us by our Preachers and others, which kept us in Blindneſs, and from making further Inquiry, and "trying all Things, and holding faſt that which is good," accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apoſtles Advice, 1 <hi>Tb.</hi> v. 21.</p>
            <p>Now about the Year 1657, there came a poor Man in a mean Habit to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Houſe, named <hi>Morgan Evan,</hi> of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> he had met with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers</hi> in his Travels, and was convinced of the Truth. This poor Man diſcourſed with my Maſter about the Principles of Truth, and I being in the Shop about my Calling, my Miſtreſs came and ſaid, Why do you not go out to help your Maſter; for there is a <hi>Quaker</hi> at the Door that hath put him to Silence? I hearing this, made haſte, and took my Bible under m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Titus</hi> ii. 11, 12. And ſo he departed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006833_0016_102A5F21A151A9C0"/>from our Houſe, and I ſet him a little along on his Way.</p>
            <p>Now when I came back from him, the Conſideration of his Words took faſt hold on me, that I could not go from under them; and the more I waited in that Light, that he recommended me to, the more my former Peace, and that in which I formerly took Comfort in, was broken: And herein I came to ſee, that our former Building could not ſtand; for we built upon that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle called, <hi>Wood, Hay and Stubble.</hi> Here I came to a Loſs of all my formal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and my formal Performances prov'd but a ſandy Foundation. Then I did, with much Humility, and Poverty of Spirit, beg of Almighty God, that I might build upon that Rock, that the true Church of Chriſt was built upon, that the Gates of Hell might not prevail againſt me.</p>
            <p>But for all this, I was yet afraid of being deceived by the <hi>Quakers;</hi> yet where to go outwardly for Advice and Counſel I knew not. For I ſaw that my former Teachers were upon a ſandy Foundation: So I deſired that the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> would be my Teacher and be fulfilled, and I believed that the Prophecy of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006833_0017_102A5F27352B8AB0"/>would be ſulfilled, and that the Lord would make a New Covenant with his People now, as he did Promiſe by the Mouth of we Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> xxxi. 31.32, 33, 34. <q>Behold, the Days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a New Covenant with the Houſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and with the Houſe of <hi>Judah;</hi> not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the Day that I took them by the Hand to bring them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> (which my Covenant they brake, although I was an Husband unto them, ſaith the Lord) But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> after thoſe Days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my People. And they ſnall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, Know ye the Lord: For they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: For I will forgive their Iniquity, and I will remember their Sin no more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and the like precious Promiſes I was made willing to take hold upon, and waited for the fulfilling of them in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006833_0017_102A5F27352B8AB0"/>myſelf, and of that which Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews, John</hi> vi. 45. <q>As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God. Every Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath heard, and hath learn'd of the Father, cometh unto me.</q> He that cometh unto Chriſt Jeſus the Light, that lighteth every Man that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World; tho' their Sins and their Iniquities be great, they ſhall in no wiſe be caſt out. And it is ſaid, <q>And all thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the Peace of thy Children,</q> 
               <hi>Iſaiah</hi> liv. 13.</p>
            <p>When I came to know a little of the Teachings of the Lord, I took my Leave of all my formal Teachers, and many Times went to the Woods, and other By-places, where none might ſee me, to wait upon the Lord, where I ſhould be much broken, and tendered by the Power of God: And though I did begin to ſee a little of myſelf, and ſomething of the Goodneſs of God, yet ſtill I was afraid of being deceived; for I had read and heard that Satan himſelf is "transformed into an Angel of Light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 14. And leſt this Man ſhould be as the ſame Apoſtle ſaid, in Verſe 13. <q>For ſuch are falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006833_0018_102A5F29B2E18EF8"/>deceitful Workers, transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves into Apoſtles of Chriſt.</q> I deſired of the Lord that I might ſee this poor Man once again, for I knew not where to ſee the Face of any call'd a Friend; and it pleaſed God that he came again that Way, and I deſired of my Maſter and Miſtreſs to give him Lodging, and that he might be with me, to which they conſented. Then I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of him their Way of Worſhip, and concerning thoſe two great Ordinances (ſo called) that we ſo much relied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bread and Wine, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Scripture, to know what was their Judgment of them, to which he gave me ſome Satisfaction: And in the Morning I parted with him, and to the beſt of my Knowledge, I ſaw him no more for ſeveral Years.</p>
            <p>In all this Time I ſtill kept my Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Wood, or ſome other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Place; and there in my waiting, I deſired of the Lord, that I might be further ſatisfied by myſelf, as to thoſe Things, <hi>Firſt,</hi> whether the Scriptures were the Word of God, as was ſaid and preached unto us they were, and the Way to Life and Salvation: Then the Firſt Chapter of <hi>John</hi> came under my
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006833_0018_102A5F29B2E18EF8"/>ſerious Conſideration in my Meditation, which ſaid, <hi>In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, the ſame was in the Beginning with God, all Things were made by him, and without him was not any Thing made, that was made. In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men; and the Light ſhineth in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehended it not.</hi> I conſidered that the Word was in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with God the Father, and that no Part of the Scriptures were written until <hi>Moſes,</hi> who we underſtand was the firſt Writer of thoſe Scriptures we have, the Apoſtle tells us here, <q>that the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</q> In this Word there was Life, <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that "the Letter killeth, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit giveth Life, now this Life is the Light of Men, and the Word was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scriptures were written." By this we may ſee the Word of God is Chriſt Jeſus, that was with the Father before the World began, "without Him there was not any Thing made, that was made." The Hiſtory that <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us, is ſaid to be written above 3000 Years after the Creation of the World.

               <hi>John</hi> xiv. 6. As for the Scriptures I was a great Lover, and a great Reader of them, and took great Pleaſure in Searching of them, thinking that they would make me wiſe unto Salvation, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
               <q>And that from a Child thou haſt known the Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</q> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>5. This main Thing was wanting; the true and ſaving Faith, that is the Gift of God. <q>It is by Grace we are ſaved, thro' Faith, not of ourſelves, it is the Gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8.</q> So it is the Grace of God that brings Salvation,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006833_0019_102A5F2CD1B31CD8"/>and not the bare hiſtorical Knowledge of the Scriptures. Too many take a great deal of Pride in a literal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them; ſome for their Gain and Profit, others take Pleaſure in them, by wreſting them to vindicate their falſe and erroneous Opinions, that gender to Strife and Contention, and take little or no Notice of that meek, holy, lovely Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life, that gave them forth; for they be of no private Interpretation: <q>But holy Men of God, ſpake them as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</q> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> i. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Men may have a great literal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures, and yet remain in Error, becauſe they know them not, as they ought to do, nor the Power that was in the holy Men that gave them forth, ſo I may ſay as Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> 
               <q>You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God,</q> 
               <hi>Mat</hi> xxii. 29. So that which gives the true Knowledge of God, and a right Underſtanding of the Scriptures, is the Spirit of God; and I may ſay with the Apoſtle, <q>For God who commanded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006833_0020_102A5F2F583328F0"/>in the Face of Chriſt Jeſus,</q> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 6. And as Men and Women come to mind this Light, that is, the Spirit of God, and to obey it, they ſhall come to the Comfort of the Scriptures, as the ſame Apoſtle ſays, <hi>For whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning; that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures, might have Hope,</hi> Rom. xv. 4.</p>
            <p>And being under a ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I read in the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Spirit of the Lord to be the Interpreter thereof. Thoſe great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that were hid from Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and are hid now in this our Age from many, are come to be revealed by the Spirit of God, and if any would have Comfort in Reading the Scriptures, they muſt wait in that Meaſure of the Spirit, which God hath given them, which is the only Key that opens them to the Underſtanding of thoſe that are truly conſcientious in the Reading of them; and though I read them formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as many do now, without a true Senſe and a due Conſideration; yet now I can bleſs God for them, and have great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the Reading of them; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more as a ſealed Book unto me,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006833_0020_102A5F2F583328F0"/>and many more, who wait for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of God's Holy Spirit, in all their Duties and Performances that the Lord requires of them; for without him we know we can do nothing that is pleaſing unto him; tho' formerly we ran in our own Time and Wills, to Preach and Pray, not having a due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Leading and Moving of the Spirit of the Lord; yet, I beleſs God, it is not ſo now. Many Times, when I did riſe from my Knees, in a formal Way of Prayer, a Reproof was very near me, "Who required this at thy Hands? It is a Spark of thy own kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling." I was afraid that I ſhould lie down in Sorrow, as was ſaid to ſome by the Lord, in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> l. 11.</p>
            <p>But as to this Head, I ſhall briefly conclude, tho' much more might be ſaid to the Honour of the Holy Scriptures; but this is my Deſire, that they that read them, may come to that which will give them a right Underſtanding, thereof: <hi>For there is a Spirit in Man, and the Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them Underſtanding,</hi> Job xxxii. 8.</p>
            <p>Then, as concerning Water-baptiſm, which I had under Conſideration, I was no Admirer of it, being not of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006833_0021_102A5F32A5B7C6E8"/>of Re-baptizing: Thoſe that were <hi>Independents,</hi> were not ſo much at firſt for Re-baptizing; but afterward it prevailed more among them, in theſe Parts, when one <hi>Henry Jeſſy</hi> came here-aways. And about that Time it was that I came from among them.</p>
            <p>I had much Reaſoning and various Conſultations in my Mind concerning this and the Bread and Wine: And when I was ſatisfied, as to them weighty Concerns, I thought I might reſt there, and keep my old Cuſtoms and Faſhions, and Language: But that would not do, I had no Peace therein; God ſhewed me the Cuſtoms of the Nation were vain, and our Language not according to the Language of God's People, recorded in the Scriptures of Truth. So I made a conſciencious Search into this Matter alſo.—Where I found the Great Creator of Heaven and Earth, who by the Word of his Power made all Things therein; <hi>Created Man in his own Image, in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God created he him: Male and Female created he them. And God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, and gave them Dominion over all Things that he had created on the Earth: and Adam gave Names to them. And God took him, and put him in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006833_0021_102A5F32A5B7C6E8"/>Garden of Eden, to dreſs it, and to keep it. And the Lord commanded the Man, ſaying, Of every Tree of the Garden thou may'ſt freely eat,</hi> Gen. ii. 15, 16. This is the firſt <hi>Thou</hi> to Man, that I read of in the Scripture; and the Great Creator ſaid, "Every Thing that he had made was very good," <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 31. And his, Language to Man was very good and pure. Then again, when <hi>Adam</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Law and Commandment of God, <q>The Lord God called unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſaid unto him, Where art thou? And he ſaid, I heard thy Voice in the Garden, and I was afraid, becauſe I was naked,</q> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 9, 10. Here was the Language of God to Man, and the Language of Man to God. And in the Searching of the Scriptures, I found that all the holy Men of God uſed that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and Chriſt taught his Diſciples to pray in that Language; <q>Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven,</q> 
               <hi>Matt.</hi> vi. And withal, I knew a little of Grammar, and that it was impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay <hi>Vos [You]</hi> to one ſingle Perſon, inſtead of <hi>Tu [Thou.]</hi> And though the Learned in our Nation ſpoke it, yet I
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006833_0022_102A5F3677BAE438"/>thought Chriſtians ſhould not uſe it, but ſhould take the Spirit of God, according to the Scripture, to be their Rule, and not to follow the confuſed Language of the <hi>Heathen;</hi> for the Lord, by the Mouth of his Prophet, commanded his People, <q>Learn not the Way of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; for the Cuſtoms of the People are vain,</q> 
               <hi>Jer.</hi> x. 2, 3. I alſo believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Lord would return to his People a pure Language, in theſe Days, as was promiſed in the Days of old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Iſrael:</hi> That when they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord, he would bring them out of their Captivity; <q>For then, [ſaith the Lord.] will I turn to the People a pure Language, that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to ſerve Him with one Conſent, <hi>Zeph.</hi> iii. 9.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I was conſcienciouſly concern'd to ſpeak the pure Language of Thee and Thou to every one, without Reſpect of Perſons; which was a great Croſs to me, though it ſeems to ſome but as a weak and fooliſh Thing; yet when the Lord lays a Neceſſity of ſpeaking the Truth to all, in that Language that God and all his Servants uſed, it comes to be of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Weight, than many light airy People think it is: The Sayings of Chriſt came
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006833_0022_102A5F3677BAE438"/>to my Mind, when he ſaid, <q>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will be my Diſciple, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me,</q> 
               <hi>Lu.</hi> ix. 23. He doth not ſay he ſhould do it, but let him do it, imperatively, which was a Command; <hi>viz.</hi> That we ſhould <hi>Deny our ſelves,</hi> and follow Him: See alſo <hi>Matt.</hi> xvi. 24. And moreover it is ſaid, "He that taketh not his Croſs, and followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, is not worthy of me," <hi>Matt.</hi> x. 38.</p>
            <p>This Neceſſity being laid upon me, I ſpoke to my Maſter in that Dialect; he was not offended at it, becauſe he was convinced of the Truth of it, and that it ought to be ſpoken to every one; but when I gave it to my Miſtreſs, ſhe took a Stick and gave me ſuch a Blow upon my bare Head, that made it ſwell, and it was ſore for a conſiderable Time, ſhe was ſo diſturbed at it, that ſhe ſwore ſhe would kill me, though ſhe ſhould be hang'd for me; the Enemy had ſo poſſeſs'd her, that ſhe was quite out of Order; though before time ſhe very ſeldom, if ever, gave me an angry Word: But I conſidered, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity was between the two Seeds, and that <q>that which is born after the Fleſh,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006833_0023_102A5F38060ADC18"/>did perſecute him that was born after the Spirit.</q> I being well ſatisfied of the Truth in myſelf, remembred Chriſt's Words, <q>He that loveth Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more than me, is not worthy of me and he that findeth his Life, ſhall loſe it; and he that loſeth his Life for my Sake, ſhall find it,</q> 
               <hi>Matt.</hi> x. 37, 39.</p>
            <p>The Almighty God put it in my Heart to conſider the Coſt, and that through Tribulation I was to enter the Kingdom of Heaven; and I was faithful in this Teſtimony that I had to bear; I was much encouraged to go on in that ſtrait and narrow Way, that God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me I was to walk in. I alſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Saying of Chriſt, <q>Whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs, and come after him, cannot be his Diſciple,</q> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 27. Again, <q>Which of you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to build a Tower, ſitteth not down firſt, and counteth the Coſt whether he hath ſufficient to finiſh it? Leſt haply after he hath laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and is not able to finiſh it, all that behold it, begin to mock him, <hi>Ibid.

This Conſideration was weighty with me, leſt I ſhould begin to take up the Croſs, and to Walk in this Way, and ſhould not be able to hold out to the lead; firſt, becauſe of the Temptation of Satan, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the ſinful Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and Faſhions of this World, which were very prevalent; and the Weight and Burthen that was upon me was great, having none in the Country to be a Help to me in the time of my Exerciſe, but the Lord alone, that hath promiſed to be with his People in all their Troubles and Exerciſes, and that he would not leave them nor forſake them. I was very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to take hold of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and my Prayers unto him were, That he would enable me to go through all Things that he required. I was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that without the Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, I could not perform that Service which he required of me.</p>
            <p>I was now firſt called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſaid to a ſingle Perſon Thee and Thou, and kept on my Hat, and did not go after the Cuſtoms and Faſhions of the World, that other Profeſſors lived and walked in.

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006833_0024_102A5F39E5F554B8"/>World; but yet they did not take up their Croſs, and leave them.</p>
            <p>The Rage of my Miſtreſs was not yet abated, tho' ſhe had nothing againſt me, but not conforming to the corrupt Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and vain Cuſtoms of the World: For I laboured to keep a Conſcience void of Offence, both towards God and Men; I did my Work and Service honeſtly and juſtly, <hi>not with Eye-ſervice, as Men-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, but in Singleneſs of Heart, as the Servant of Chriſt, doing the Will of God from the Heart,</hi> Epheſ. vi. 5, 6, and ver. 8. <hi>Knowing that whatſoever good thing any Man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be Bond or Free.</hi>

            <p>In thus doing, I had great Comfort from the Lord, and did receive from him liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satisfaction and Encouragement, to go on in my Way; remembring that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſaith, <hi>The Righteous ſhall hold on his Way, and he that hath clean Hands, ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Job xvii. 9.

I remembred what Chriſt hath told us in <hi>Luke</hi> xxi. 12. <hi>They ſhall lay their Hands on you, and perſecute you, delivering you up to the Synagogues, and into Priſons, being brought before Kings and Rulers for my Name's Sake: And it ſhall return to you for a Teſtimony.

Theſe and the like Afflictions I was to meet with, if I truly and faithfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; therefore I laboured to put on the whole Armour of Light, that I might be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the fiery Darts of the Wicked One whether in myſelf or by ſeeking to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my Faith, and to perſwade me of the Hardneſs, Streightneſs and Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Way, that I ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hold out to the End, being there was not any in this Country to help and aſſiſt me; and the fiery Darts of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy that I felt, came more by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants than otherwiſe; very prevalent he was in this poor miſled Woman, my Miſtreſs, who was perſwaded by him to kill me, and ſhed innocent Blood; and one Time when ſhe thought it a fit Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to execute her Will and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, ſhe fell into a great Rage, and I was freely given up to die that Hour by her; but the Lord was pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of my Free-will Offering, and I might ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>

            <p>About this Time [1637.] it was the great Talk of the Country that I was become a <hi>Quaker;</hi> my Parents were much concerned about me; I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006833_0026_102A5F3ECF648D40"/>that the Prieſt of <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> one <hi>W.

I had not been yet with my Father nor Mother; but waited for Freedom and Clearneſs in myſelf, and then I went to ſee them, and in my Way I viſited an old Friend of mine, that was a Profeſſor, and had a little Opportunity to ſpeak to him of the Things of God, and his Goodneſs to me, and a young Man called <hi>David Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies</hi> was then convinced of the Truth; this was on a Seventh-day in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and when I was clear there, I went to <hi>Welch-Pool</hi> to my Parents. It was a Trouble to them, to ſee that I did not, as formerly, go upon my Knees to aſk their Bleſſing, and bow to them, and take off my Hat, my Father ſoon turn'd his Back upon me; I had heard of his Diſpleaſure, and that he had ſaid he would leave me Nothing, ſaying to my Relations, that they thought to have had Comfort of me, but now they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected none but that I would go up and down the Country, crying, <hi>Repent, Repent.</hi> Now if my Father ſhould have

               <hi>Pſalm</hi> xxvii. 9, 10, 11:</p>
            <p>At length my Mother came tenderly to me, and took a View of me, looking on my Face, and ſhe ſaw that I was her Child, and that I was not as they ſaid, Bewitched, or Transformed into ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Likeneſs, which was reported of <hi>Quakers</hi> then, and that they bewitched People to their Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus they deceived them and many others, with ſuch ſtrange Stories, and we were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted with the Apoſtles, <hi>Deceivers, yet true.</hi> And when I diſcourſed with her out of the Scriptures, her Heart was much tendered and affected with the Goodneſs of God towards me, ſhe went to ſee for my Father, and when ſhe

            <p>But when my Father came to his Houſe he ſpoke not much to me that Night.

               </gap> Town in this County of <hi>Momtgomery,</hi> and in the Love of God, I went upon the Firſt Day of the Week to viſit him, where we had a comfortable, refreſhing Meeting together, and the Lord's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was with us, tho' we were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers one to another, as to the outward, yet we had Fellowſhip and Union one with another in the inward Life of Righteouſneſs; his Name was <hi>Roger Prichard.</hi> He tarried not long there but went back again to <hi>Ireland;</hi> tho' it it was ſaid, that he came to theſe Parts with an Intention to ſtay here, and to bear his Teſtimony for God, in this dark Corner of <hi>North-Wales;</hi> but he not being faithful to God, who ſent him here, as he was going back he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered great Loſſes by Sea, and loſt his good Condition alſo, and turned back to the Vanities of the World, which was a great Sorrow and Exerciſe to me: But the Lord viſited him again, as may be ſeen hereafter. Thus I was left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone again.</p>
            <p>I continued, as the Lord made Way for me, to viſit thoſe in whom I found any Inclination to the Things that were good: And there was one <hi>William Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:006833_0030_102A5F4939690198"/>convinced of the Truth with me? And I was alſo made willing to viſit the <hi>Independent</hi> Meeting, and thoſe People that I formerly belonged unto, that were a ſeparate People, gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chiefly by <hi>Vavaſor Powell</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, a zealous Man in his Day and Time. But when Truth broke for the in this Country, I being the firſt that came to receive it in theſe Parts, did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate myſelf from them, in Love to that bleſſed Truth that I received, and it became my true Teacher. So the ſaid <hi>Vavaſor Powell</hi> proved angry, and preached much againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> their Way and Principles. I hearing this, came at a certain Time to a Place called <hi>Cloddiecochion,</hi> near <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> to their Meeting, expecting to find him there, but he was not there; but one <hi>John Griffithes</hi> (called a Juſtice of the Peace) was Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. When I came in among them, they ſeemed uneaſy; and when I had an Opportunity, I bore a Teſtimony for God, and his Son Chriſt Jeſus, his Way, Truth and People, which they preached againſt. When I had done what I had to ſay, he went on again; and when I found ſomething more on my Spirit to declare among them, this <hi>John
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006833_0031_102A5F4AEF61CA90"/>Griffithes</hi> commanded to take me away; and a near Relation of mine that owned the Houſe, took me in his Arms and led me out of the Houſe, through the Fold, and through a Gate that opened to the Common, and ſhut the Gate after me; and there I ſat under an Aſh Tree, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning ſorrowfully, to ſee their Blindneſs, Darkneſs, and Hardneſs of Heart, with Pride and Haughtineſs, that was come over a People that once were loving, kind, and humble in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And as I ſat weightily under a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration what and when would be the End of all theſe Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Hardneſs of Heart, I prayed to the Lord for them: And the Word of the Lord came to me, "That tho' they put me out of their Houſe, yet in Time they would come to own Truth, and that Houſe ſhould be a Meeting-place for Friends: Of this a further Account may be ſeen hereafter. So I went away well ſatisfied with the Love and Goodneſs of God to me that Day, in giving me Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Conſolation for my Tears of Sorrow and Affliction that I met with a little before; and I rememb'red the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 11. <hi>Now no Chast'ning for the preſent ſeemeth joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

            </p>
            <p>After this I ſtill waited to know the Will and Counſel of God, and that he might direct me in my Way, and order my Steps in this my ſpiritual Travel; for I had none to look unto, but to Him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who was All-ſufficient to carry on the Work which he had begun, tho often by weak, poor, mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Inſtruments in the Eyes of the World. Well might I ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>But God hath choſen the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Things of the World, to confound the wiſe; and God hath choſen the weak Things of the World, to confound the Things which are mighty; and baſe Things of the World, and Things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea, and Things which are not, to bring to nought Things that are,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 27, 28.</p>
            <p>About this Time I went to viſit ſome young Men that had been my former Companions in Profeſſion of Religion; Two or Three of them were convinced, and received the Truth. So then, when we were come to the Number of Four, it was with me that we ought to meet
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006833_0032_102A5F50CB2F8298"/>together, in the Name of the Lord; for I remembered the Promiſe of Chriſt; who ſaid, <hi>Where Two or Three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my Name, there am I in the Midſt of them,</hi> Mat. xviii. 20.</p>
            <p>So we all agreed to meet together, but none of us had a Houſe of his own to meet in; we determined therefore to meet upon a Hill in a Common, as near as we could for the Conveniency of each other, we living ſome Miles diſtant one from another. And there we met in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to the Wonder of the Country; when the Rain and Weather did beat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us on one Side of the Hill, we went to the other Side; we were not free to go into any Neighbour's Incloſures, for they were ſo blind, ſo dark and ignorant, that they look'd upon us as Witches, and would go away from us, ſome croſſing themſelves with their Hands, about their Foreheads and Faces.</p>
            <p>And thus we continued for ſome Time, when Two of them left me; one of them was put an Apprentice by Friends to <hi>W. Shewen,</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> the other young Man was a Soldier in <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi>'s Days, and he got as ſoon as he could to be diſbanded, ſo he went to <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire,</hi> and lived among Friends; the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006833_0032_102A5F50CB2F8298"/>other was one <hi>William D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies,</hi> that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hard by me, and we both met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſome Time; but at one Time he ſtay'd longer than uſual, and a foul, dark Spirit poſſeſſed him, inſomuch that the little. Time we were together, was not comfortable to me; and when we had broke up the Meeting, by Way of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he aſked me, How I did think we ſhould ſtand in the Face of the whole Country? I anſwered him with great Zeal, The Serpent, the Serpent, the ſame that beguiled the Woman in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, hath beguiled thee, thou wilt not be able to ſtand: And while we were yet diſcourſing, I ſaw my Maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who was alſo convinced, but was not faithful to that good Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him of the Truth, and ſhewed him what he ought to do, but did it not (yet he continued loving to Friends, and frequented their Meetings to his latter End) as I looked back I ſaw him come towards us, with two Women follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, the one was his Wife, my cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Miſtreſs, the other was his Siſter, they both had Staves in their Hands, and when they came unto us, the Siſter began to beat her Brother, my Maſter, and my Miſtreſs ſet a beating of <hi>W. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies;</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:006833_0033_102A5F5257D3D2B0"/>ſo his Trial came very quickly, and <hi>W. Davies</hi> came no more to meet with me, nor any other Friends for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years; yet he afterwards came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Friends, and continued with them to the End of his Days, and was buried among them. Now it ſo happened that I had never a Blow among them, and if I had received any, I had learnt of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord and Maſter to ſuffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for his Name's Sake, and not to depart from him though my Trials, Temptations and Afflictions were not a few; ſo that I might ſay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>But none of thoſe Things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto myſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my Courſe with Joy;</hi> Acts xx. 24.2 Cor. iv. 17. Mat. x. 37.38, 39.</p>
            <p>Theſe young Men going away thus, I was left alone again, but ſtill I kept waiting upon the Lord, to know his Will and good Pleaſure concerning me, and when the Time of my Apprentiſhip was over, I found Freedom to go to <hi>London,</hi> to viſit Friends there, which was in the Year 1658-9. And finding many good and living Friends there, I ſettled to my Trade, being a Felt-maker, and very well ſatisfied I was, that I
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006833_0033_102A5F5257D3D2B0"/>could go to Meetings, and follow my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and when any Thing would come to my Mind, of this my native Country, barren and uninhabited with Friends and Truth, I endeavoured to ſhut it out, and to keep where I was, and I did what I could; but all my fair Pretences, and Reaſonings would not do, diſobedient to the Lord I was, and Trouble, and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Judgment from the Lord came upon me, for not obeying his Command, to go to my own Country, to ſtand a Witneſs for him there; in this my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience I continued, till I had loſt his Preſence, and he ſmote me with Trouble within, and Pain in my Bones, that I could not Work nor Labour; in this Time Friends of <hi>London</hi> were very kind, and careful of me, and would freely have adminiſtered unto me, but I was not willing to accept of any Thing from them, ſo long as I had of my own, my Pain of Body and Spirit increaſed upon me, till at laſt I was forced to bow to the Will of the great God, that was too ſtrong for me, and reaſoning with him one Night, upon the Bed of my Sorrows, he ſhewed me clearly, that I was to go to my own Country, and I was made willing to give up to go if he would be pleaſed
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006833_0034_102A5F53FB84F810"/>to let me know his Will by the Token that he would remove my Pain; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I reaſoned with him thus, That I was alone, like a Pellican in the Wilderneſs or a Sparrow on a Houſe Top. And the Lord ſtill commanded me to go, and that he would provide a Help-meet for me. And when I had made a Covenant with the Lord to go, immediately my Pain was removed, and I had Peace and Quietneſs of Mind and Spirit. And I aroſe next Morning, and went to my Work; and when thoſe tender Friends that had a Regard for me in my Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, came to ſee me that Morning, I was gone to Work, which was to their Admiration.</p>
            <p>So the Lord gave me a little Time and he alone provided a Help-meet for me, for I prayed unto him, that ſhe might be of his own providing, for it was not yet manifeſt to me, where ſhe was, nor who ſhe was: But one Time as I was at <hi>Horſly-down</hi> Meeting, in <hi>Southwark,</hi> I heard a Woman Friend open her Mouth by Way of Teſtimony, againſt an Evil ranting Spirit, that did oppoſe Feiends much in thoſe Days; it came to me from the Lord, that that Woman was to be my Wife, and to go with me to the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006833_0034_102A5F53FB84F810"/>Country, and to be a Help-meet for me; after Meeting, I drew ſomewhat near to her, but I ſpoke nothing, nor made any Acquaintance with her, nor did I know when or where I ſhould ſee her again. I was very willing to let the Lord order it as ſeemed beſt to himſelf, and therein I was eaſy; and in Time the Lord bro't us acquainted one with another, and ſhe confeſſed that ſhe had ſome Sight, of the ſame Thing, that I had ſeen concerning her; ſo after ſome Time we parted, and I was freely reſigned to the Will of God; and when we came together again I told her if the Lord did order her to be my Wife, ſhe muſt come with me to a ſtrange Country, where there were no Friends, but what God in Time might call and gather to Himſelf. Upon a little Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſhe ſaid, If the Lord ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſo ſhe muſt go with her Husband, tho' it were to a Wilderneſs; and ſhe being ſomewhat ſenſible of the Workings of God upon her Spirit, in this Matter, ſhe was willing to condeſcend in her Mind, to what God had wrought in her; but by hearkening to ſome Friend of hers, that had not well weighed the Matter, ſhe became diſobedient to what God had revealed to her; which bro't
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006833_0035_102A3838AC3EDFB0"/>great Sorrow and Trouble upon her; and I went to ſee her in this poor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and I reſted ſatisfied with the Will of God in this Concern, being free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſigned, if the Lord had wrought the ſame Thing in her as was in me to receive her as the Gift of Almighty God to me; and after ſome Time, we waited upon the Lord together, the aroſe, and declared before me, and the other Friend that had begot Doubts and Reaſonings in her Mind, that in the Name and Power of God, ſhe conſented to be my Wife, and to go along with me, whether the Lord ſhould order us; and I ſaid, In the Fear of the Lord I receive thee as the Gift of God to me. And ſo I reſted ſatisfied in the Will of God, for a further Accompliſhment of it.</p>
            <p>And being under a weighty Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which Way to take each other in Marriage, we concluded to lay our Proceedings before our Elders, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially our ancient Friend <hi>George Fox</hi> (now People in thoſe Days were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Prieſt or before a Juſtice) and I told <hi>G. F.</hi> we thought to take each other in a Publick Meeting; ſo he deſired the Lord to be with us. And when we ſaw our Clearneſs in the Lord, we went to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006833_0035_102A3838AC3EDFB0"/>the <hi>Snail-Meeting,</hi> in <hi>Tower-ſtreet, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> in the Morning; and in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon to <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſly-down, Southwark,</hi> and in that Meeting, being the 26th of the 4th Month, 1659. in the Preſence of God, and that Aſſembly, we took each other to be Man and Wife.</p>
            <p>God alone did know our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and our Integrity in going toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it was not for Gold nor Silver, nor any outward Thing; but to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to him in our Age and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſtand Witneſſes for him, and his bleſſed Truth, where the Lord ſhould ſend us. I might ſay with <hi>Tobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Thou madeſt Adam, and gaveſt him Eve, his Wife, for a Helper and a Stay; of them came Mankind. Thou haſt ſaid it is not good that Man ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, let us make him an Aid like himſelf,</hi> Tobit viii. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Soon after, in the Lord's Time, we made what haſte we could, to come to the Country, where we believed the Lord would have us to be, and we ſaid, O <hi>Lord, if thou wilt go with us in our Way, and give us Bread to eat, and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put on, then, O Lord, thou ſhalt be our God;</hi> and the Lord was with us, in all our Journey, and gave unto
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006833_0036_102A5F55DA905E88"/>us, his ſweet and comfortable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Soon after we came to <hi>Welch-Pool</hi> thoſe Profeſſors which had been and were in great Power, began to be faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, becauſe of the Report there was of bringing in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; which in a little Time was accompliſhed, and thoſe that were in great Pomp, were bro't to Priſon themſelves. And I was had before the firſt Juſtices that were made in theſe Parts, by the Authority of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d (in the Year 1660) Notwithſtanding I was a Priſoner to the Magiſtrate of the Town. And when I went up before them, many of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Town followed me, to ſee what would become of me, and to what Priſon they would ſend me, or what Puniſhment they would inflict upon me. But the Lord was with me, and I feared not Man, whoſe Breath is in his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, but the living God, whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to obey in all Things. And when I was come into the Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:006833_0036_102A5F55DA905E88"/>me for ſome Time. In a little while, I ask'd them, Whether they ſent for me there? And they ſaid, They did. And one of the Juſtices asked me, Where I had that new Way, and ſtrange Religion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I anſwer'd him, it was the good Old Way that the Prophets and Servants of God lived and walked in; and that Way I had found, and deſired to walk in it all my Days. That Juſtice was peeviſh, and ſaid, I think the Man is mad; I think we muſt have him whipt; though I anſwered them according to Scripture, yet they were ignorant of it. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of me to take the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Supremacy: I told them, That my Lord and Maſter <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and his Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> commanded me, <hi>not to ſwear at all.</hi> They had a Prieſt with them there, and he took upon him to queſtion me; the firſt Thing he asked me was, which was firſt, Reaſon or Scripture? I told him, That Reaſon was before Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>God made Man a reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in his Own Image;</hi> and that the firſt Part of the Scripiures, which we have now extant, was writ by <hi>Moſes:</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That the Law came by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And I further told them,

               </gap> whether he was a Juſtice of the Peace, or not? And I asked whether he was not a Prieſt? They ſaid, they looked upon him to be a fitter Man than themſelves to diſcourſe with me about Religion. I told them, I thought he was as the High-Prieſt among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay enſnaring Queſtions to Chriſt, when he was brought before them, to ſeek to make him an Offender; and turning my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Juſtices, I deſired them to take Notice of that Man, who laid thoſe enſnaring Queſtions to ſeek to make me an Offender. Then the Prieſt left me, and the Juſtices of the Peace called to me, and asked me (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I would not take the Oaths) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would give Bail? and ſaid, they would take my Father's Bail for my good Behaviour I told them, my Cauſe was juſt, and that I was innocent, and I would give them no Bail, for the Truth binds me to my good Behaviour. Then the High-Sheriff (a very fair
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006833_0037_102A5F57D23170B0"/>Man) told me, I was a ſtrange Man, and of a ſtrange Perſwaſion, to come with my Hat upon my Head among them, and would not take the Oaths, nor give Bail: you know, ſaid he, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Feſtus; Noble Feſtus.</hi> I told him, That <hi>Paul</hi> had tried <hi>Feſtus;</hi> but I had not yet tried him; and it might be, that I might ſpeak of him; <hi>Noble Sheriff.</hi> Upon this they were moſt of them very pleaſant. He called to me, and asked me, who I did know there? there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of my Relations Juſtices there, who very well knew me, but I made mention of none of them; but) I told him, I knew the Chief Magiſtrate of the Town (one <hi>Charles Jones</hi>) whoſe Priſoner I was. Then they called for him, and asked him, whether he knew me? He ſaid he did very well, for I was born and bred in the Town among them, and was a very honeſt young Man all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; but (ſaid he) what Devilihe hath now, I know not. Then they asked him, whether I was his Priſoner? And he ſaid I was. Then ſaid the Juſtices, take him again to your Cuſtody. And as I was going out of the Room, I told the Juſtices, that I brought a good Hat on my Head there, but was going away

            <p>About the Third Month 1660, many of thoſe Profeſſors, both Captains, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and Soldiers, that were in Arms in <hi>Oliver</hi> and <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi>'s Days were put in Priſon in the Town of <hi>Montgomery:</hi> My Wife and I did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that I ſhould be ſent there to them; though I never was a Soldier, nor bore any Arms for either Side. And in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Time, there came a Troop of Horſe
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006833_0038_102A5F5AC64C55D0"/>for me, to take me to Priſon: My Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions offered to give Bail for me, but it would not be accepted of. So I went to acquaint my Wife of it, and to make my ſelf ready to go with them: One of the Soldiers came up Stairs after me, with a Piſtol and naked Sword; and my Wife riſing her ſelf up, and ſitting in Bed, (being delivered but three Days before of her firſt Child) ſhe ſaid, <hi>Dear huſhand, be faithful to God, whatever becomes of me.</hi> The Soldier ſeeing her, retreated back. So I went down to the Troop of Horſe ſtanding in the Street before my Houſe: There was among them one bad Man (that run away in my Father's Debt) threat'ned to compel me to follow his Horſe's Heels on Foot many Miles. But by this Time ſeveral of the Aldermen, and others of the Town were gathered together in the Street, who deſired this Man, and others of the Troop, to let me alone for that Time, and they would engage Body for Body, that I ſhould be in my Priſon next Morning; but they could not prevail. At length ſome of the Aldermen fell into a Rage, and they bid them meddle with me if they durſt; and bid me go to my Houſe, which I was not willing to do; for
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006833_0039_102A5F5E76BC8320"/>great Fear came upon me, leſt there ſhould be a Quarrel among them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my going or ſtaying. But one or two of the Aldermen being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate than the reſt, deſired their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till the Captain might be ſpoken with who was then in Town. He ſoon granted that I ſhould ſtay at Home that Night, and be in <hi>Montgomery</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon next Morning; and was angry at that bad Man, for his Incivility toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Aldermen that interceded for me; for the Captain knew I was a peaceable Man, and never concerned myſelf in Fighting for one Side or other. And when the Troop had their Orders, they went on their Way; and I praiſed God for the Multitude of his Mercies, in that there was no Bloodſhed that Day: For many of the Young Men of the Town, with the Aldermen, were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Clubs and Staves, ſaying, What ſhould a Town's born Child be ſo abuſed by ſuch a bad Fellow as that was before-mentioned? My Heart often trembled within me, leſt any Thing ſhould fall amiſs in this Tumult; and I deſired them often, before they went to the Captain, that I might go along with them towards my Priſon.</p>

               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:006833_0039_102A5F5E76BC8320"/>
So, that Night I ſtaid at Home, and next Morning I took my Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Priſon to <hi>Montgomery;</hi> and I avoided the Houſe of my Uncle (that was a Juſtice of the Peace in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, near my Way, and a Brother-in-Law to this Captain) leſt he ſhould ſtop me from going to Priſon. So I went there my ſelf alone, and told the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, one <hi>John Maſon,</hi> that I was come a Priſoner; and he took me up to an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Garret for my Lodging, but I had the Liberty of the Houſe, as well as other Priſoners; there being many of thoſe called <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> who were formerly my great Acquaintance; but now they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſtrange, and would not diſcourſe with me; But I conſidered the Reaſon, and was informed, that theſe old formal Church-Members or Profeſſors had agreed among themſelves, that they would not diſcourſe with me, nor receive any Books from me, leſt the moſt ſerious inwad. Chriſtians among them (as they ſaid) ſhould turn <hi>Quakers.</hi> But in a little Time, their Orders and Covenants were broken, and I was moved to go to their Meeting, ſometimes, having little to ſay among them but a Sigh or a Groan, and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006833_0040_102A5F607A24DB70"/>a Travel in my Spirit for them, which did often put them out of Order in their Preaching and Praying; and as the Lord would order it, I ſpoke a few Words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there, and he came to meet with me in my Room. And there was one of the Profeſſors, <hi>Cadwalader Edwards,</hi> alſo convinced, and he too came up with us to meet in the Priſon: and then there came to be Diſcourſings and Diſputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and me. In this Time, I wrote a few Lines to ſend Home to my Wife; but I knew not by whom to ſend it, for it was very hard to ſend any Papers out of Priſon; the Marſhal, or Goaler would examine and ſearch ſuch as came in, or went out, for Letters.

I deſired her not to be afraid, for I would read it to her firſt, and the Goaler might ſee it, if he pleaſed; and after I had read it to
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006833_0040_102A5F607A24DB70"/>her, ſhe was tenderly affected, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Brethren again, and ſaid, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe People will never come to us, but we muſt go to them. In ſome Time after, thro' much Trouble and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe came to receive the Truth, to live in it, and obey it: Her Name is <hi>Margaret Bowen,</hi> Wife of <hi>John Bowen</hi> of <hi>Collſryn;</hi> and Mother to <hi>Peter Bowen,</hi> in <hi>Martin's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Grand, London;</hi> and ſhe is yet alive.</p>
            <p>In a little Time my Service was over among thoſe Profeſſors in that Priſon, and the Lord made Way for my Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in about two Weeks Time, or a little more, I came away, and left the reſt of the Priſoners there, where they continued afterwards for a conſiderable Time; I was well ſatisfied with the Goodneſs of God, that I found his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Life and Power with me, and a preſent Help in the Time of Need, that kept me low and humble, that I durſt not rejoice that Spirits were made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but rather that I found my Name written in Heaven: So I came Home in great Love and Peace to my Wife and Family, and many of my loving Neighbours rejoiced to ſee me.</p>
            <p>I continued about my Calling and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis, and waited upon God to know his
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006833_0041_102A5F63582EB068"/>Mind and Will concerning me. In this Time I heard of an honeſt old Woman, who had received the Truth ſome Time before, about <hi>Montgomery,</hi> her Name was <hi>Anne Hamon,</hi> Wife of <hi>Thomas Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> my Wife and I went to viſit her. Soon after, about the Year 1651. I went to a Meeting, at a Place called <hi>Edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> near <hi>Wem</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here our Friend <hi>William Gibſon</hi> and I were taken Priſoners, with about 25 or 26 more, and ſent to <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> When we were brought there, we ſaw the Temper of the Jaylor to be very cruel, and he threat'ned us, with a great deal of Hardſhip, if we did not eat of his Meat, and drink of his Drink, and lie on his Beds, and give him what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; we told him, we were the King's Priſoners, and we demanded a free Priſon, and Straw to lie upon, but he in a Rage denied us that, and put us in a little Room, where there was ſcarce Place for us to lie down; when Night <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame, Sleep came upon us, we being weary by travelling ſo many Miles on Foot; but we were made willing and able to ſuffer all Things; ſo that Night we lay upon the Boards, and it was pleaſant unto us, being warm Weather, and about
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006833_0041_102A5F63582EB068"/>the Time of Hay-Harveſt; the next Morning we were very freſh and well, praiſing God for his Mercies and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us; the Jaylor came to us, and ask'd us how we did like our Lodging, and how we ſlept? We told him, we ſlept in Peace of Conſcience, and Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs of Mind, for we ſuffered for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake towards God, and durſt not break the Command of Chriſt and His Apoſtle, who commanded us not to ſwear at all. For our ſuppoſed Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, was not only for meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for refuſing the Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and Supremacy. The Jaylor being a very paſſionate inconſiderate Man, he would go out in the Morning from his own Houſe, and not come back till Night, and then returned ſo drunk, that be could hardly ſpeak or ſtand. The next Night when we went to lie down, the Room was ſo little, we could not all lie at once; the next Morning we complained to the Jaylor, that there was not enough of Room for us all to lie down, and deſired him to let us have a little Straw, but it would not be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us. By this Time the Friends of the Town had Liberty to come to viſit us, and to bring us in ſome Proviſion; and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006833_0042_102A5F66CCD8BA10"/>when the Door was opened for us to go into another Room, there being a corded Bedſtead it that Room, <hi>William Gibſon</hi> and I lay upon the Cords, and next Morning we found that the Print of the Cords was not only in our Clothes, but in our Skin alſo, ſo that it would have been eaſier for us to have lain upon the Boards as we did before. By this Time having well obſerved the Jaylor's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Temper, I began to be uneaſy in myſelf to let him alone; ſo I watched him in the Morning upon his firſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, when he would come to the Court that was before our Priſon Door, and I began to diſcourſe with him about the Priſoners that lay in ſuch Hardſhip, I told him they were honeſt Men, and moſt of them Maſters of Families, and they had good Beds to lie upon at Home, but now they were content for Chriſt's and the Goſpel's Sake, to ſuffer that Hardſhip, and deſired him to let them have their Liberty to go to their Friends in Town at Night, and to come there in the Morning, and if he would not be pleaſed to grant them a little Straw, then to let them go lie in their own Beds; which he ſurlily deny'd, calling them a Company of Rogues and Knaves,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006833_0042_102A5F66CCD8BA10"/>and ſuch like Terms. He asked me, What made me to plead for them? I told him, they were my Friends; he anſwered, Why your Friends? You are no <hi>Quaker,</hi> are you? I ſaid, I am call'd a <hi>Quaker.</hi> He anſwered, You do not look like a <hi>Quaker:</hi> And he looked me in my Face, and on my Hands and Body. I deſired him not to diſgrace me ſo, as to tell me I was no <hi>Quaker;</hi> then he asked me where I lived? I told him, when I was at Home, I lived at <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> and my Family was there: But, ſaid he, where are you now? I asked him, whether he did not know I was a Priſoner there with my Friends? And he asked me, whether I did lie upon the Boards with them? I told him, I did: He ſaid he was ſorry for it; but went away in Anger, being much diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in himſelf. So I did not ſee him till next Morning, at which Time I went to him again, and I friendly diſcourſed with him; he ſaid, he did enquire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me in the Town, and he ſaid: might take the Liberty of the Town; I did acknowledge his Kindneſs; but I told him, it would be no Comfort to me to have the Liberty of the Town, and leave my Friends and Brethren there,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:006833_0043_102A5F6984088050"/>he ſaid, then I might ſtay there with them: So I did not ſee him till the next Morning, and then I went to him again; he was ſo croſs and ill-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, he would not ſuffer any other Friend to ſpeak to him. <hi>William Gibſon</hi> did ſo judge him for his Wickedneſs, that he kept him cloſe in a Room by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. After five or ſix Nights lying on the Boards, I prevailed with him, that Friends might have the Liberty of the Town in the Night, and be there in the Morning: So the next Day he began to be more friendly to us. After ſome Days, I deſired our Friend <hi>John Milling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to come with me to the Jaylor's Houſe, to ſee whether we could have Leave to go Home till the Aſſizes; but then it was not granted: But he told me, if I pleaſed I might go Home till then; I told him, he might as freely let them go as me, for moſt of them liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the County, and I lived out of the County; but no more could we have that Time of him: But I was uneaſy in myſelf (ſeeing I had got a Place in him) to let him alone, but ſtill I preſſed for my Friends further Liberty: In a little Time afterwards, I prevailed with him by ſerious Arguments, as it was Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt-time,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:006833_0043_102A5F6984088050"/>and it was hard for their Wives, or ſome of their Families, to come with weekly Neceſſaries for them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, with my Friend <hi>John Millington,</hi> prevailed with him to let them go, and he took our Words for our Appearance at the next Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>Through the Goodneſs of God, we all came together to <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> to our Priſon before the Aſſizes; and when we came there, we found a great Alteration in the Jaylor, he was very low and mournful, he had loſt a Priſoner, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, and was to be tried for his Life for his Eſcape; he was very loving and kind to us, and let Friends go themſelves to <hi>Bridgenorth,</hi> about 14 Miles, where the Aſſizes were then held, and he deſired me to ſtay with him in his Affliction; and not be much from him; he ſaid his Life was at Stake, and if God and the Judge would ſhew him any Mercy, it was upon our Friends Account, and not for any Deſerts that were in himſelf, for he confeſſed he had been too ſevere to us; but, notwithſtanding, ſaid he, you are merciful Men, and can forgive Wrongs and Injuries.</p>
            <p>Then, when we came to <hi>Bridgenorth,</hi> we were put in a large ſpacious room in
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:006833_0044_102A5F6BB0B807D8"/>the Houſe of Correction, to be there in the Day-time, that we might be all together, and ready when called for; but we had liberty of going in and out for Lodging, and what Neceſſaries we wanted: No Keeper being over us, but what we ſet our ſelves to look to the Door, and that too many Friends might not be out at once, and thoſe were not to ſtay out too long; and we ſaw it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that Friends ſhould go out by two and two, to walk the Streets; for it was a ſtrange Thing to People to hear of <hi>Quakers.</hi> Once it fell to my Lot to be at the Door, (tho' the Door was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways open, that ſuch as would might come and ſee us; with ſeveral of them we had Reaſonings and Diſputes about the Way of Truth and Righteouſneſs.) There came one, who appeared ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a Gentleman, and asked me, Whether he might ſee the <hi>Quakers?</hi> I deſired him to walk up along with me, and he ſhould ſee them. And when I had brought him up to the Room where Friends were walking, I told him, Thoſe were they. He anſwered, Theſe be Chriſtians, like ourſelves; but when are the <hi>Quakers?</hi> I told him, Theſe were they that were called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:006833_0044_102A5F6BB0B807D8"/>He asked me, Whether I was one of them? I anſwered him, I was one ſo called. I had an Opportunity to declare to him the Way of Truth, and that the Name of <hi>Quaker</hi> was given to us in Scorn and Deriſion; and he departed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friendly. Some People were ſo blind and dark in thoſe Days, as to look upon us to be ſome ſtrange Creatures, and not like other Men and Women. They would gather much about us in the Town, and we had good Opportunities to ſpeak of the Things of God to 'em. But I was pretty much with the Goaler, waiting when his Trial could be: And when it came, I went with him, and ſtood ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near him, which he was very glad of. The Jury cleared him, being not found guilty of a wilful Eſcape; which was Gladneſs to him, and Satisfaction to us. And when the Aſſizes was near at an End, the Judge returned us to one Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Holland,</hi> (except <hi>William Gihſon,</hi> to whom the Judge put it, Whether he would go Home, if he was diſcharged? but he could not make the Judge ſuch a Promiſe as he required, ſo he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted again to the ſame Priſon) but we were freely and friendly diſcharged, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had good Service in that Town,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:006833_0045_102A5F6DB0AC1928"/>and the Lord was with us, and brought us ſafe Home, to the Comfort of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and ourſelves; and we have cauſe to bleſs and Praiſe the Name of the Lord for ever, for all his Mercies and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us all along, in the Time of our Afflictions and Perſecutions; and we could ſay, <hi>Surely God is good to Iſrael, and unto all them that draw nigh unto him with an upright Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1662, a further Concern came upon me about Meetings in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in this Time I went to know, whether he would perform his Promiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which he readily granted; and I appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Day and Time with him, which he gave Notice of to his Neighbours thereabouts. I being deſtitute of a Friend to go with me to the ſaid Meeting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon the Lord, that he would provide a ſuitable Companion to go with me. And my Wife going to <hi>Shrewsbury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I told her of the Meeting, and deſired her to ſpeak to Friends there of it; and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:006833_0045_102A5F6DB0AC1928"/>if there was any Publick Friend there, that he might come along with her. There happened to be one <hi>Richard Moor</hi> of <hi>Salop,</hi> a worthy and faithful Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Goſpel, who came along with her to our Houſe in <hi>Welch-Poul.</hi> This was in the 9th Month 1662. A Day or two after we went to the Meeting, where there came in <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Dolobran,</hi> who was formerly in Commiſſion of the Peace, and had been in Election to be High-Sheriff of that County, and ſeveral of his well-meaning Neighbours, ſome of them were Profeſſors, belonging to the ſame People that I formerly belonged unto. The Lord was not wanting, but afforded unto us his good Preſence; Life and Power came from Him, that reached to the Hearts and Underſtanding of moſt of the People then preſent, who gave Teſtimony to the Truth, Life and Power of God, that appeared with us that Time; and in the Love, Fear, and Life of Truth we parted.</p>
            <p>The next Morning we went to viſit <hi>Charles Lloy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> of <hi>Dalobran</hi> aforeſaid, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tly received us, and ſeveral of thoſe People that were at the Meeting came there that Day; where we had a ſweet, comfortable, refreſhing Time, in
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:006833_0046_102A38360F5074B8"/>the Preſence of the Lord; as it is ſaid, <hi>In his Preſence is Fulneſs of Joy, and at his Right Hand there are Pleoſures for evermore,</hi> Pſalm xvi. 11.</p>
            <p>The Sound and Report of this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing went through the Country, ſome ſaying, that moſt of that Side the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were turned <hi>Quakers.</hi> Whereupon divers were ſent for before <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> Baron of <hi>Cherbury,</hi> to a Place where he then lived, called <hi>Llyſſin,</hi> about three Miles from <hi>Dolobran;</hi> after ſome Diſcourſe with them, he ſent them to <hi>Welch-Pool</hi> to Priſon, for refuſing to take the Oath of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, which they refuſed, becauſe they could not ſwear at all; they being about Six ſent together, <hi>viz. Charles Lloyd Hugh David, Richard David, Cadwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lader Edwards, Ann Lawrence, Sarah Wilſon,</hi> &amp;c. where they were coutinued very cloſe Priſoners.</p>
            <p>In a little Time there were added Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to them, <hi>William Lewis</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> his Wife, who were Owners of the ſaid Houſe of <hi>Cloddiecochion</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, where I was moved to go about the Year 1657, to a Meeting there of the Profeſſors (which is now the Place of my abode.) And this <hi>William Lewis</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:006833_0046_102A38360F5074B8"/>my near Relation, was he that led me out of the Houſe to the Common, and ſhut the Gate againſt me, as is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated (<hi>Page</hi> 40.) And thus the Word of the Lord was fulfilled, that came to me then, <q>That thoſe People ſhould own and receive Truth, and that Houſe ſhould be a Meeting-houſe for us:</q> Which it now is, and hath been for theſe 40 Years.</p>
            <p>The Oath of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy being tender'd to them, they could not take it for Conſcience Sake; Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all being forbidden by Chriſt and his Apoſtle <hi>James;</hi> ſo they were ſent to Priſon, and continued Priſoners there. There was alſo at that Time one <hi>Edward Evans,</hi> an honeſt, ſubſtantial Man, that was committed to Priſon for the ſame ſuppoſed Offence, who was convinced ſometime before: I having had ſome weighty Diſcourſe with him about the Things of God. He told me, That when he was in Priſon with <hi>Vavaſor Powell,</hi> with many more of his Brethren in <hi>Pool</hi>-Goal before this Time, that <hi>Vavaſor</hi> leaning upon a Window of their Priſon that opened to the Street, ſaw me and my dear Wife paſs by that Way, and he ſaid on this wiſe, <q>Behold <hi>Zicharias</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:006833_0047_102A5F734019D160"/>and <hi>Elizabeth!</hi> It was ſaid of them That <hi>they walked in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God blameleſs.</hi>
               </q> This <hi>Edward Evans,</hi> and ſome others of the ſaid Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, looking out thro' the Window; ſaw us two called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that he and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a little before had preached ſeverely againſt, they look'd upon it, that the Lord had forced him to give that Teſtimony of us, and ſeveral of 'em (as he ſaid) were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thereby, and ſometime after, came to live in Obedience to the Truth, and ſuffer'd for it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Priſoners were kept very cloſe, ſome of them were Subſtantial Freehold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were put in a dirty naſty Place, near the Stable and Houſe of Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a low Room; the Felons and other Malefactors in a Chamber over Head, their Chamber-Pots and Excrements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falling upon them. And <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> (who was a little before in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Peace, as aforeſaid) was put in a little ſmoaky Room, and did lie upon a little Straw himſelf for a conſiderable Time; and at length his tender Wiſe <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that was of a conſiderable Family (Daughters of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Lort,</hi> near <hi>Pembroke,</hi> in <hi>South-Wales</hi>), was made willing to he upon Straw, with her dear and tender Husband. And
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:006833_0047_102A5F734019D160"/>ſhus they both, with the reſt of Friends did rather <hi>chooſe to ſuffer Afflictions with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a Seaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I ſtaid at Home with them for ſome Time, keeping our Meetings in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but at length the Jaylor had ſtrict Charge to keep me from among 'em, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The foregoing Paper was ſent to the Magiſtrates at their Quarter-Seſſions, held at</hi> Montgomery, <hi>the 8th Day of the 11th Month,</hi> 1662.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A little Time after this I went to <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn,</hi> near <hi>Bala;</hi> in <hi>Merionethſhire,</hi> to viſit ſome Friends and tender Profeſſors there, who received me kindly; and there I ſettled a Meeting among them, in the Power of God; and from thence I came Home, where I ſtaid but a little while to viſit theſe Priſoners. And ſoon after I went to the Houſe of <hi>Owen Lewis,</hi> at <hi>Tyddyn y Gareg,</hi> near <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelle,</hi> in <hi>Merionethſhire,</hi> a Man that had been in Commiſſion of the Peace in <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>'s Days, and was newly come from Priſon from <hi>Bala,</hi> who received me kindly (he was firſt convinced by <hi>Tho.

<pb n="78" facs="unknown:006833_0050_102A5F7B1E9DE7E8"/>ſaid County (who was a Juſtice of the Peace in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Days) and his Father, his Brothers, <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>John Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey;</hi> theſe, with many more there had received the Truth, in the Love of it, and continued faithful, ſerviceable Men in their Country, and kept Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in their Houſes, and many were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the Lord among the Rocks and Mountains in thoſe Parts; this was in the Year 1662. After this Journey, the Lord brought me ſafe Home to my Wife and Family, to the Comfort of my Friends, and one another in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Not long after this <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> Brother to the ſaid <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobran,</hi> hearing that his Brother was in Priſon, came from <hi>Oxford</hi> to viſit him, having been a Student there for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Years (as alſo his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> had been before him) they told me, that the great Sufferings of Friends in that City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> by the Magiſtrates, and by the wild and ungodly Scholars, did work much upon them; and they had ſome ſecret Love for Friends then. So when <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> came Home; he being ſome Time with Friends in Priſon, and elſewhere; the Lord opened his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by his Light, Life and
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:006833_0050_102A5F7B1E9DE7E8"/>Power, and he received the Truth, and was obedient to it, and took up his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Croſs, and followed Jeſus, and came to be his Diſciple, and was taught by him, and he went no more to <hi>Oxford</hi> for Learning; for I may ſay with <hi>David, The Lord made him wiſer than all his</hi> former <hi>Teachers.</hi> He ſtaid pretty much at Home (and with his eldeſt Brother <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi>) and in theſe Parts.</p>
            <p>The Jaylor of <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> was very cruel to Friends, and continued them in that naſty Hole before-mentioned, till one of theſe Friends, called <hi>Edward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans,</hi> beforeſaid, fell ſick (by Reaſon of the Dampneſs and Unhealthineſs of the Room) and died; and the Jaylor would not ſuffer us to have his Body to be buried, except we would pay the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner, and ſo clear him, as if he had had no Hand in his Death; but at laſt his Relations prevailed, without a Coroner's laqueſt; and they took him, and buried him on a Hill, on the Back-ſide of the Steeple-houſe, in <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> and it happened, as they were digging the Grave, they found ſome Bones of a Man, and upon Enquiry in ſome old Records, it was ſaid there was an old Judge buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there; and the Name of that Place is
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:006833_0051_102A5F7CC335DA88"/>called ever ſince <hi>Judge's-Hill.</hi> We had got no Burying-place of our own then, but were about having one.</p>

               <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> and I not being Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers now, though (except us two) meſt that were convinced were Priſoners. The Report of ſuch who were turned <hi>Quakers,</hi> being ſpread abroad, they were ſoon ſent for before a Magiſtrate, and the Oath of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, was tendered to both Men and Women; and they for Conſcience Sake refuſing it, were ſent to Priſon in order to be premunired.</p>
            <p>My Friend <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> and I were moved to go and viſit moſt of the Juſtices, that had a Hand in Committing Friends to Priſon, we began at the fartheſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice towards <hi>Machynlleth,</hi> and ſo came down to <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> Baron of <hi>Cherbury</hi> at <hi>Llyſſin</hi> aforeſaid, who had committed <hi>Charles Lloyd,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends; we underſtood on the Way that he was at a Bowling-Green, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral were with him, near a Place called the <hi>Can Office,</hi> near the High-Way Side, (and not far from <hi>Llyſſin;</hi>) where we beheld them Bowling, we conſidered with each other, which Way to take, there being a peeviſh Prieſt, the ſaid
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:006833_0051_102A5F7CC335DA88"/>Lords's Chaplain, with them, ſo I asked <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> whether he would engage the Prieſt in Diſcourſe, or go to the ſaid Lord; he choſe the laſt; and got into the Green leiſurely towards him where moſt of them knew <hi>Thomas;</hi> but he went not in their complimenting Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, he ſtaid there but a little while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they broke up their Game, and while he diſcourſed with the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> I diſcourſed a little with the Prieſt. And the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> coming toward the Prieſt and me, he ſaid to the Prieſt (whoſe Name was <hi>Jones</hi>) Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> whom have you got there? He anſwered, A <hi>Quaker,</hi> and Haberdaſher of Hats, that lives in <hi>Welch-Pool.</hi> Oh! ſaid the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> I thought he was ſuch an One, he keeps his Hat ſo faſt upon his Block. Then he intending and preparing to come down a great ſteep Ditch, I ſtepped down to lend him my Hand to help him, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſt would have ſtepped between him and me; but the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Prieſt's Help, and ſtopping a little, ſaid to the Prieſt, Here is a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſtands by will ſay, "The Blind leads the Blind, and both will fall into the Ditch." The Prieſt was ſo drunk, that the, could not ſtand by himſelf; this

The Goaler had an empty Houſe at the End of the Town, and there he let Friends go, which was a ſweet; convenient Place near the Fields, without any Keeper over them; and they had the Liberty of the Town, and to go where they pleaſed, except to their own Houſes.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Charles, Lloyd</hi> took a Houſe in Town for him and his Family to live in; and we kept our Meetings in that Houſe of the Jaylor's aforeſaid, for ſeveral Years; moſt of Friends by this Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a Premunire; and many Friends came from ſeveral Places to viſit them, and thoſe that were convinced towards <hi>Machinlleth,</hi> as <hi>William Evans,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others of that End of the County (who were formerly <hi>Independents</hi>) were ſent here to Priſon upon the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, refuſing to take the Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance

            <p>A little after this, one <hi>Thomas Ellis</hi> (that was called a Deacon in the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Congregation) was convinced, a Man of great Eſteem among them, and ſo he was alſo afterwards amongſt us.

Ellis</hi> told me, he was not willing to take them away till they had fully clear'd themſelves of what was upon them to deliver among them; but at laſt they called to him again, and bid him take them away; then he aroſe from among the Company, and went to them, and deſired them to go with him to the next Room, for he had ſomething to ſay to them; and the Friends went readily with him; then he told them on this wiſe, Friends, You ſee how we are met together here, we are like the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, who was ſpending his Portion, and we have a little left unſpent; and when we have ſpent all, we muſt return to our Heavenly Father, and come to you, and to your Way. And the Friends went away well ſatisfied.—I have made much Enquiry who theſe Friends were, and from whence they came, but could not certainly learn who they were. As for our Friend <hi>Thomas Ellis,</hi> the Lord bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and poured his Spirit upon him, and gave him Part of the Miniſtry, and he became a faithful Labourer and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable

They committed me to one Serjeant's Houſe; and <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> Brother to <hi>Charles Lloyd,</hi> and one <hi>Samuel Lloyd</hi> (Son to <hi>Samuel Lloyd of Dudſon,</hi> in the County of <hi>Salop,</hi> and eldeſt Brother, to <hi>John</hi> and <hi>David Lloyd</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Edward Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Briſtol</hi>) to the other Serjeant's Houſe; but when the Serjeant that I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to was come from the Steeple-Houſe, he turned me out, and bid me go Home, I ſhould not ſtay there; ſo I went firſt to ſee my Friends, the old Priſoners, which were kept (for a little
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:006833_0063_102A5F913A42FA60"/>Time) more cloſe; and we were not ſuffered to go to them; they were very glad to ſee me, and I was refreſhed alſo to ſee them, though we could not go to one another. In a little Time I went to ſee the other two Priſoners that were at the other Serjeant's Houſe, and the Serjeant let them come Home with me.</p>
            <p>On Second-day following, it came in my Mind that the Magiſtrates would try us with an Offer to paſs by that Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, upon the Condition that we would go to the Steeple-houſe to their Worſhip the next Firſt-day following; which I told to Friends.</p>
            <p>On Third-day following, Juſtice <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> and the two Bailiffs that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted us to Priſon, ſent for us before them. So we Three went, <hi>viz. Thomas Lloyd, Samuel Lloyd,</hi> and myſelf. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Diſcourſe with them, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us, That if we would go to Church, and hear divine Service, as they call'd it, we ſhould be diſcharged. I told them, that when I was laſt there, they turned me out of their Church; and if I ſhould make any Promiſe to go there, it might be that they would do the like to me again. Juſtice <hi>Corbet</hi> ſaid, he would engage I ſhould not be
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:006833_0064_102A5F95C2D6B328"/>turn'd out. Then I told them, I knew nothing to the contrary but that I would go there. Juſtice <hi>Corbet</hi> ſeem'd to be ſatisfied; but one of the Bailiffs ſaid, Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> do you think that the old <hi>Quaker</hi> will go to Church, except it be to diſturb our Miniſter? <hi>Corbet</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, whether I would diſturb the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter? I told him, if God ſhould put ſomething in my Heart to ſpeak to the People, I hope they would not impoſe upon me to hold my Peace. He ſaid, God forbid they ſhould do ſo! Then I told him, I hop'd I ſhould perform what It promiſed to do: And ſo they diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us. Now none was under an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to go to the Steeple-houſe but myſelf, and the Report went about, that the old <hi>Quaker</hi> would go to Church.</p>
            <p>So when Firſt-day came, and the Bells began to ring, the other two Friend's (viz. <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> and <hi>Samuel Lloyd</hi>) came to me, and ſaid, we think we muſt go with thee to the Steeple-houſe, I took my Bible under my Arm, and went to Juſtice <hi>Corbet</hi>'s Houſe (that was but a few Doors from my Houſe) to let him ſee that I was going; and I asked him, if he was going? He ſaid, he was not diſpoſed to go that Day, but he would
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:006833_0064_102A5F95C2D6B328"/>ſend his Man to ſee we were not affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So the two Friends and myſelf went to my own Pew, which was oppoſite to the Pulpit; there was in the Pulpit only the Curate to read the Common-Prayer, and their Service to them that Morning: There was a great Multitude of People; it was ſaid, there were ſome, that had not been at their Church for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years before. So nothing was laid upon us to ſpeak to the People till he had done: Then I ſtood up, and ſaid to the People, <hi>I ſuppoſe you are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Cauſe of our coming here this Day, which was thus; The Magiſtrates of the Town came to our Meeting, and they found us upon our Knees, praying to Almighty God; they were civil while we were at Prayer, and when we had done, they took our Names, and committed us Three to Priſon, moſt of the reſt that were at the Meeting were Priſoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: The Magiſtrates afterwards ſent for us, and told us, if we would come to Church, we ſhould be diſcharged; and now you ſee we are come, according to their Deſire: But I find that your Prieſt is not here, and now I would have you to inform him, that I ſay,</hi>

1. <hi>If he proves this to be the true Church of Chriſt;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>And that he is a true Minister of Chriſt;</hi>

            </p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Your Church to be a falſe Church;</hi>

            <p>All the People were very civil and orderly, and heard me a conſiderable Time in the Steeple houſe; and when I had done, our Friend <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> ſpoke a few very ſeaſonable Words to the People. And the People ſaid, if Mr. <hi>Langford</hi> (which was the Prieſt's Name) will not prove us to be the true Church of Chriſt, and our Worſhip to be the true Worſhip, then we will pay him no more Tythes; for what <hi>Richard</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:006833_0065_102A5F990FDECA38"/>
               <hi>Davies</hi> ſaid, he proved it out of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for, you ſee, he had the Bible in his Hand all the while. So for that Time we parted.</p>
            <p>When the Bells rang again for them to go to their Evening Service, it lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to go there again, and the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Friends went along with me; where the old High-prieſt was, who made a long Sermon, till we were all uneaſy; but I deſired the Friends to bear all Things patiently. When the Prieſt had done, he was going away; and I ſtep'd up in my Seat, and deſired him to ſtay, for I had ſomething to ſay to him; which was the ſame as aforeſaid. When he heard my Queries, and what I had to ſay, he turned his Back, and went away, and gave us no Anſwer. Then I ſaid, <hi>Behold the Hireling fleeth, becauſe be is an Hireling;</hi> and ſome of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſtaid, and ſome of 'em went with him, but all ſeem'd diſſatisfied that he would not prove them to be the true Church of Chriſt, &amp;c. And I had a good Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſpeak to the People more at large in the Grave yard; the Lord's Preſence, Life and Power was with us, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:006833_0066_102A5F9BEE9093F8"/>who doth not leave nor forſake his People that truſt in him.</p>
            <p>When we came Home, Juſtice <hi>Corbet</hi> ſent for us again to him; he met us in his Court, and ſaid, he was ſorry that Mr. <hi>Langford,</hi> was ſo uncivil, that he did not anſwer our Queries, which he thought was very reaſonable that he ſhould. And in a little Time many of the Neighbours were gathered together in the Street and in his Court; we had a good Opportunity to reaſon with him, and to open to the People, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them the Way and Means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Kingdom of Heaven; and he was ſo moderate, that one of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſaid to him, Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> we think you will be a <hi>Quaker</hi> too. His Anſwer was, I wiſh I were a <hi>Quaker</hi> in my Life and Converſation. And towards the End of our Diſcourſe, he deſired me to give him my Queries in Writing, that Mr. <hi>Langford</hi> might anſwer 'em; for ſaid he, it may be he was not prepared to anſwer you then, but he may anſwer them in Writing. I told him, that was but a private Way of anſwering; but if he was rot prepared then, I told him, we would give him a Meeting next Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at the Steeple h uſe, or in the
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:006833_0066_102A5F9BEE9093F8"/>Town-Hall upon a Market, Day, He ſaid that was very fair.</p>
            <p>This Counſellor <hi>Corbet</hi> was very friendly and loving to us, and did no more perſecute us to his dying Day; but did us all the Good he could in all the Courts of Judicature, where he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>As for this Prieſt, <hi>William Langford,</hi> many Friends were moved to go to him to the Steeple-houſe in the Time of his Service, to declare to him and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what they had to ſay from the Lord; and when the Magiſtrates have committed ſome of them to the Priſon on that Account, this Prieſt, when his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was over, hath got them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed.</p>
            <p>Some Time after this, he ſent the Clerk of the Pariſh to me for <hi>Eaſter</hi>-reckonings; I asked the Clerk, whether his Maſter did expect any Thing of me that had nothing from him? and bid him tell his Maſter, I would come to reckon with him by and by; ſo the Clerk went away, and in a little Time I made myſelf ready, and went to him; there were a pretty many People with him: I told him, that his Clerk had been with me from him, for that which
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:006833_0067_102A5F9DB2ED75D8"/>he call'd <hi>Eaſter</hi>-reckonings, and I was come to reckon with him; and if he could make it appear that I owed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thing, I would pay him, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the ſame from him. He ſaid I owed him for ſeveral Years for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. I asked what he meaned by the Word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for I found no ſuch Word in the Scripture? He ſaid it mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bread and Wine which were uſed in the Church. I told him I received none of him, and therefore not liable to pay. He anſwered again, Why, then you might come to Church, and receive it. I told him, I did not believe that his Church was the true Church of Chriſt; and I did not believe that he was a true Miniſter of Chriſt, commiſſionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Him to break the Bread, and give it to the People, and much leſs to ſell it, or take Money for it of the People; for I did not read in all the Scripture, that the true Miniſters of Chriſt did take any Money of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for that Bread they delivered unto them. He ſaid then, That the Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was worthy of his Hire; and under the Law it was ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the Mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn.</hi> I told him, he trod out no
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:006833_0067_102A5F9DB2ED75D8"/>Corn for me; and tho' he was an Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet I never hired him.</p>
            <p>The People coming thick to pay him for the Bread and Wine, I ask'd him how in Conſcience he could take ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for ſo little Bread and Wine? it being I ſuppoſe about 10 <hi>
                  <abbr>d.</abbr>
               </hi> for Man and Wife. I ask'd him, what Scripture he had for it? and deſired him to prove his Practice by Scripture. He asked me, what Scripture I had to eat Flum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery? I told him, I had Scripture to eat it; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Timothy, For every Creature of God is good, and nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: For it is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer,</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 4, 5. His Communicants, who were preſent, were much diſſatisfied that he had no better Anſwer and Proof for his Practice. I deſired the People to take Notice, that he could not make it appear by Scripture, that I owed him any Thing: But I told them, that he owed me ſome Money, and I deſired him to pay it me; which he did; and then we parted fairly. We have a Saying, <hi>That even or often Reckonings make long Friends.</hi> He was very friendly afterwards, and never ſent to me more for <hi>Eaſter</hi>-reckonings.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:006833_0068_102A5FA0F1C2D4A0"/>And as for the Tythe in Time of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, he charged his Servants to take from me no more than what was called their due, nor ſo much: I was inform'd he ſhould ſay, he knew not why he ſhould take any Thing from me, ſeeing I had nothing from him. He lived here among us many Years a good Neighbour; and though in the Time of great Perſecution, yet he had no Hand in perſecuting any of us.</p>
            <p>We have Cauſe to bleſs the Lord, who carried us through all our Services and Exerciſes, in the Time of our Weakneſs; and though we were little and low in our own Eyes, the Lord did not leave us, nor forſake us, bleſſed be his holy Name for ever.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1663, or 1604. I went to <hi>London,</hi> and I found ſome there ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from that Love and Unity, which I formerly ſaw them in, joining in that Spirit with <hi>John Perrot,</hi> who was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come from Priſon at <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> as it was ſaid, with much ſeeming Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Lowlineſs of Mind; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Company joined together with him, where they had me among them for a little Time. The Tendency of that Spirit was to ſpeak Evil of Friends,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:006833_0068_102A5FA0F1C2D4A0"/>that bore the Burthen and Heat of the Day, and to cry out againſt Friends, as dead and formal; and they expected a more glorious Diſpenſation than had been yet among Friends; and they kept on their Hats in Time of Ptayer. I was but a little while among them, till a Vail of Darkneſs came over me; and under that Vail I came to have a light Eſteem for my dear and ancient Friend <hi>G. F.</hi> and ſome others, who had been near and dear to me. But it pleaſed the Lord to rend the Vail of Darkneſs, and cauſe the Light of his Countenance to ſhine again upon me; whereby I came to ſee the doleful Place I was led into, by a Spirit that tended to nothing but Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exaltation, and (under a Pretence of Humility and Self-denial) the Breach of that Unity, Love and Fellowſhip, that formerly we had together; and the good Eſteem we had one of another in the Lord; Children we were of one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſteeming one another above our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Lord; there was no Jar or Contention among us then, but all dwelt together in Love and Unity, and in the Fellowſhip of that bleſſed Goſpel of Peace, Life and Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:006833_0069_102A5FA3117D95B8"/>
At my Return Home from <hi>London,</hi> I was ſoon taken to the ſame Priſon with my Friends in <hi>Welch-Pool;</hi> and little before I came among them to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the under Jaylor dreamed a Dream, how that he had in his Foldra Flock of Sheep, and that he was wreſtling to get <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in one Ram among the Sheep, but could not get him in; but when I came to Priſon, he ſaid to my Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd,</hi> Now I have got the old Ram in among the Sheep. But the Jaylor turned me out the firſt Night to my Wife and Family; and though I had the Name of a Priſoner, and was premunired as the reſt of my Friends and Brethren were for ſeveral Years, yet I was not kept cloſe Priſoner.</p>
            <p>This was a Time when moſt travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friends were taken up Priſoners; and though I was a Priſoner, yet it lay upon me to get Liberty to go and viſit Friends in ſeveral Counties of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> ſo I followed my good Guide, that ſhewed me what to do; I went to the Jaylor, and told him, I had an Occaſion to go out a little while, and I could not go without acquainting him of it, becauſe I was his Priſoner; and he ſaid, I warrant you will go to Preach
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:006833_0069_102A5FA3117D95B8"/>ſome where or other, and then you will be taken to Priſon; and what ſhall I do then, ſaid he? I told him, that if I was taken Priſoner, I would ſend to him where I was, and he might ſend for me if he pleaſed, to he bid me have a care of myſelf.</p>
            <p>In a little Time in the Love of God, I took my leave here of my Friends and Family, and committed myſelf, to the Protection of the Almighty; I began my Journey, and went to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> where I had good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Lord; ſo I went to <hi>Tewkes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> where I never was before; an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Woman Friend followed my Horſe, and before I had put up at the Inn, ſhe was with me, and cordially ſaid, ſhe had a Senſe upon her, that I was one of her (Heavenly) Father's Children; ſo when I went in, and had refreſhed me a little, I asked her, whether ſhe thought I might have a Meeting with Friends that Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and ſhe readily ſaid, She would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint Friends of it, and after ſhe had gone a little Way out of the Inn, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>returned again, and deſired to know my Name, that ſhe might acquaint Friends of it; I was ſtreightened in my ſelf, to give her my Name, tho' I knew not
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:006833_0070_102A5FA52FA5FB98"/>the Cauſe then; but I deſired her to go in the Name of the Lord, and if I came in the Name of the Lord, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me; ſo ſhe went, and came again, and told me, I might have a Meeting; which was appointed to be at <hi>Suſan Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thins;</hi> and a Bleſſed heavenly Meeting we had, and the Lord gave to us our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected End; there were ſeveral Profeſſors at the Meeting, ſome came to me next Morning, and diſcourſed friendly with me about the Things of God.</p>
            <p>From thence I went thro' <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> where I had good Meetings, and ſo to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and when I was clear at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the Lord having bleſſed me, and preſerved me ſo far in my Journey; I ſet forward towards <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> I travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without any Companion, but the Lord alone, who was with me all along in my Journey, he was my Helper and Preſerver; ſo I came to the Houſe of our Friend <hi>Lewis Davies,</hi> who gladly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me in the Lord; I ſtaying there ſome Time, they lent me a Horſe to go to a Meeting at <hi>Redſtone,</hi> and I left my own behind me, thinking he might reſt for ſome Days after my hard Riding. When I came to the Place, the Meeting was out of Doors, there being no Houſe,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:006833_0070_102A5FA52FA5FB98"/>that I did know of, that could contain the Multitude of People that was there, and when we came to the Meeting, there was one <hi>Meredith Edwards,</hi> (whom Friends judged unfit to Preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) that had the Confidence to ſpeak to the People, till they were weary of him, and thoſe that were ſenſible were burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; after ſome Time there ſtood up a Friend and ſilenced him. I ſat as a Stranger among them, and the Lord was with us, and his good Preſence was our Comfort and Satisfaction; and after ſome Time I had an Opportunity to open to the People, thoſe Things that belong to their Eternal Salvation; ſo I concluded the Meeting in Prayer, and this Man, <hi>M. E.</hi> aforeſaid, ſtood up again and Preached to the People, and I turned my Back and came away, and the Friends with moſt Part of the People followed me, and as I was coming out, a Friend came and told me, there was two Soldiers, (tho' I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood afterwards, they were the two Sons of a Prieſt) that had brought my Horſe there ſome Miles, and when I ſaw my Horſe, I drew nigh to them, and asked them, who brought my Horſe there? And they asked me, whether I was the Man that came from <hi>Briſtol?</hi> I ſaid, I
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:006833_0071_102A5FA9A40A0748"/>was. Then, ſaid they, you are the Man we were looking for. I asked them by what Authority they came, or what Warrant they had; and they ſhewed me their Swords and Piſtols. I told them, ſuch Warrants High-way-men had. Then I asked them, how they could dare to venture in ſuch Manner among ſuch a Company as there was of us? They ſaid in Anſwer, They knew we were peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men, and would not reſiſt, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would have brought greater Force. I told Friends we were not bound to obey them, and deſired Friends to part, and leave only Two or Three with me; but Friends Love was ſo great to me, that they kept moſtly in a Body about me; I deſired the Friend, to take my Saddle and Bridle that was on the Friend's Horſe that I rid to the Meeting on, and put them upon my own Horſe; then I got upon my Horſe, and bid them lay their Hands off my Horſe, for I feared not their Swords nor Piſtols; but if they had a Warrant from any Juſtice of the Peace, or lawful Magiſtrate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the County, I would obey it; upon which they let go their Hold, and I turning a little aſide, ſaw them take hold of <hi>M. E.</hi> whom I could not call a Friend,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:006833_0071_102A5FA9A40A0748"/>becauſe he was not guided by a right Spirit: I turned myſelf to them again, and told them, that if any Juſtice of the Peace, or any lawful Magiſtrate within the County, had any Thing to ſay to me, who came from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> they might hear of me at the Houſe of <hi>William Bateman,</hi> in <hi>Haverford-weſt,</hi> for my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs required ſome Stay in the Country. So they let us go pretty friendly, and I had ſeveral brave Meetings in <hi>Haver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-weſt,</hi> and other Places in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The laſt Meeting I had in the County was at <hi>Ponchiſon</hi> among the <hi>Welch,</hi> they having Notice of a <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> coming to keep a Meeting in thoſe Parts; many came to that Meeting, and good Service I had for the Lord, his Truth being declared in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to them: We had the Meeting out of Doors, and I ſtood with my Back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Wall of <hi>Thomas Simmons</hi>'s Houſe; I was young and ſtrong, my Voice was heard to the Steeple-houſe, and moſt of them came out to hear me, and very few came out with the Prieſt when he had done; when the Prieſt ſaw there was ſuch a Multitude with me, he was moved into Paſſion, and would have had a Conſtable to take me
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:006833_0072_102A5FAC688C8228"/>down: It was reported that ſome there ſaid to the Prieſt, they would not take me down, for I preached Chriſt and the Goſpel to them, and they would have him come and learn of me himſelf: I was informed that the Prieſt's Wife, and two of his Daughters, were there at the Meeting, and were very loving and tender, and came to be convinced of the Truth. The Lord was not wanting in us, his Life and Power, and good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was with us; and that Meeting was the laſt I had in <hi>Pembrokeſhire</hi> at that Time: The Friends of that County were very loving and careful of Friends that came from far to viſit them; they dwelt in Love and Unity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: My Service was weighty upon me, being without a Companion: The Lord alone, that knew the Integrity of my Heart, was my Comfort, Support, and exceeding great Reward. As for the other Man, <hi>M. E.</hi> aforeſaid, the two Men before mentioned took him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Juſtice; the Juſtice would have been moderate to him, and would have ſhewed him Kindneſs, but he by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> governable Temper, provoked the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to Paſſion, ſo that he committed him to the Houſe of Correction as a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:006833_0072_102A5FAC688C8228"/>for three Months, to the great Trouble of Friends.</p>
            <p>I was informed that the Juſtices of the Peace, and Magiſtrates of that County, were generally very moderate in the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Times of Perſecution. At <hi>Ponchiſon</hi> I took my Leave of Friends in <hi>Pembroke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and came pretty directly Home, to the Comfort of my Wife and Family, and thoſe Friends that were Priſoners; bleſſed be the Name of the Lord. The Jaylor was well ſatisfied that I came to my Priſon, without further Trouble to him; there were ſeveral taken Priſoners at thoſe Meetings that I was at, but the Lord preſerved and delivered me, bleſſed be his holy Name for ever.</p>
            <p>I was but a little Time at Home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there came one <hi>John Whitehouſe,</hi> a Follower of <hi>John Perrot,</hi> and he had a Meeting at my Houſe in <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> I happened not to be at the Beginning of the Meeting, but came before the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was concluded, and I found that he had ſown an evil Seed, and that ſome of and Friends had received it, who ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter joined with that corrupt Spirit, which led them to have a light Eſteem of their Brethren, which was a great Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to many honeſt Friends, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:006833_0073_102A5FAF66690200"/>to my Wife and me; and we were ready to ſay, <hi>Hath the Lord ſem us here to be inſtrumental for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a People in this Country; and hath be ſuffered the Enemy to ſcatter them in their Imaginations.</hi> Some Time after the Lord ſatisfied me, That thoſe who were ſimple-hearted among them, ſhould be reſtored again into a more ſettled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than they had formerly known, and I believed in the Word of the Lord. And in Time the Lord broke in among them, and opened the Underſtanding of ſome of them, and they began to reaſon among themſelves, and ſaw that they were in Darkneſs; and moſt of them were reſtored to their firſt Love, and lived and died faithful to Truth; except one <hi>Cadwalader Edwards,</hi> who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Stubbornneſs, and Hardneſs of Heart, and endeavoured to hurt ſuch as were ſimple-hearted. I was moved of the Lord to give forth a Paper againſt him, and all his vain Imaginations: The following Paper was likewiſe ſent to him from Friends.</p>

            <p>In 1668, this being read in one of our Monthly Meetings for Worſhip, the Lord was pleaſed to afford us his ſweet Preſence, and his Power melted, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and mollified our Hearts; which cauſed us to praiſe the Lord, for his
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:006833_0074_102A5FB1A4EA0ED8"/>great Goodneſs and Mercy to us, in bringing us out of that Darkneſs which came over us by giving heed unto the ſeducing Spirit of <hi>John Perrot, John Whitehouſe,</hi> and this <hi>Cadw. Edwards.</hi> Friends were very careful afterwards of receiving any Spirit that might tend to the Breach of Love and Unity among us. Many other Friends brought in their. Teſtimonies againſt that Spirit, among the reſt, there was one that came from our Friend <hi>Thomas Ellis,</hi> who had been particularly warned by me, in the Fear of the Lord, not to touch nor meddle with that Spirit (tho' it came with much ſeeming Humility) leſt he ſhould ſuffer thereby, which he did, to his great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and he ſet out in his Paper, and ſaid, <hi>This have I ſuffered for my mungrel, Moderation:</hi> But bleſſed be the Lord, he was ſweetly reſtored again to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Love and Integrity, to the great Comfort of himſelf, and his Brethren.</p>
            <p>As to theſe Men, <hi>viz. John Perrot, John Whitehouſe,</hi> and the ſaid
<note n="*" place="bottom">He became afterwards very bad, and ungodly in his Life and Converſation, and died in the Fleet-Priſon at LONDON, being there for Debt; yet near his End, he ſeem'd to repent of his wicked Life, and told ſome, <q>That they who were preſerved faithful among the People called QUAKERS would be happy, and that they were the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</q>
               </note> 
               <hi>Cadw.
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:006833_0074_102A5FB1A4EA0ED8"/>Edwards,</hi> they turned their Backs upon God and his Truth, and followed the Devices of their own Hearts and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>About this Time there being a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Friends gathered at <hi>Aberyſtwith</hi> in <hi>Cardiganſhire,</hi> moſt of them were ſent to Priſon to <hi>Cardigan</hi> Town, and our Friend <hi>Thomas Ellis</hi> was taken Priſoner with them; and I having the Sufferings of theſe young-convinced Friends under Conſideration, I found much Love in my Heart towards them, even ſo as to go to the Magiſtrates of the County to offer myſelf a Priſoner inſtead of my Friend and Brother <hi>Thomas Ellis,</hi> and ſome others, that they might go Home to viſit their Families. I acquainted my Wife of my Exerciſe, which came pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cloſe to her; but, after ſome Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, with much Tenderneſs, ſhe gave me up for that Service. In a few Days I took my Journey, and went firſt to <hi>Thomas Ellis</hi>'s Houſe to viſit his Wife and Family, before I went further; his Houſe being about 24 Miles from <hi>Welch-Phol,</hi> and not far off my Way to <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſhire,</hi> and there I very unexpectedly met <hi>T. Ellis</hi> himſelf at Home; he told me they were all diſcharged out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:006833_0075_102A5FB36FCFFD80"/>And thus I ſaw it was the good Will and Pleaſure of my heavenly Father to accept of my Free-will Offering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Deed; and my Friend <hi>T. Ellis</hi> and his Wife were ſenſible of my Love and Kindneſs to them therein.</p>
            <p>And now my Service being further for <hi>Pembrokeſhire, T. Ellis</hi> was willing to accompany me in my Journey; and we went to <hi>Aberyſtwith</hi> to viſit thoſe Friends there, where we had a pretty large Meeting on Firſt-day in the Morning; there came in one <hi>Thomas Price,</hi> Brother to Sir <hi>Richard Price</hi> of <hi>Gogord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and took us all Priſoners, and committed us to the Town-priſon. That Evening we had a Meeting in the Houſe where we were Priſoners; many of the Town's People, and ſome of them Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Account, were at the Meeting that Evening: I declared the Word of the Lord to them in <hi>Welch,</hi> and ſhewed them the Way to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And a ſweet, comfortable Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had, and great Satisfaction it was to them that were there.</p>
            <p>That Night a weighty Conſideration came upon me about theſe young con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Friends, that were ſo lately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of their Impriſonment, becauſe
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:006833_0075_102A5FB36FCFFD80"/>they were like to go ſo quickly to Priſon again. I asked Counſel of the Lord what we might do for and in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of thoſe young and tender Friends; and being under a great Exerciſe in my Spirit, and earneſtly praying to God, that he might make ſome Way for their Enlargement; it came in my Mind to write to the chief Magiſtrate, Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Price,</hi> and to give him an Account of my Journey ſo far, and how that my Friend <hi>T. Ellis</hi> and myſelf intended for <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> and we reſted with our Friends, and having a Meeting with them that Day, were taken Priſoners by his Brother <hi>Thomas Price,</hi> and if it was his Pleaſure to ſend us to Priſon to <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> he would be ſo kind to leave his Neighbours at Home, and accept of my Friend <hi>T. Ellis</hi> and myſelf as Priſoners inſtead of them all: To this Effect I wrote to him, and ſent it next Morning; but he ſent me no Anſwer. But the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> conſtable came to us, and told us, we moſt all prepare to go to <hi>Cardigan</hi>-Town, where the County Goal was kept. So Friends freely and heartily prepared themſelves to go. And when the Time of our going was come, they tenderly taking their Leave of their Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

            <p>The Conſtable had Inſtructions to bring us to the Quarter-Seſſions, then held at <hi>

                  </gap>lanbedar,</hi> and not to <hi>Cardigan;</hi> when we came there, the Juſtices being upon the Bonch, we were had before them, ſome of them were formerly acquainted with <hi>Tho. Ellis,</hi> he having been in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, (and according to his Place; ſomewhat ſharp againſt Offenders) the Juſtices were very moderate to him; but the Clerk of the Peace was very peeviſh and froward. So I asked the Juſtices. Whether that Man, that did queſtion my Friend, was a Juſtice of the Peace? And they told me, he was not; then I told them, we were not bound to anſwer him. But, if they would give me Leave, I would give them a juſt Account of my Buſineſs in that County, and upon what Account we were ſent there before them; and they deſired me to ſpeak on.—I told them,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:006833_0076_102A5FB6639F6A50"/>I was at my own Houſe, with my Wife and Family, in <hi>Welch-Pool</hi> in <hi>Montgome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhire,</hi> and hearing that my Friend <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ellis,</hi> and other of my Friends, were in Priſon in this County of <hi>Cardigan,</hi> for a conſiderable Time; it was with me to come to the Magiſtrates of this County, to offer myſelf a Priſoner, that my Friend <hi>T. Ellis,</hi> and the reſt of them, might go for a little Time to viſit their Families; in order thereunto, I came as far as my Friend <hi>T. Ellis</hi>'s Houſe, where I found him at Home with his Wife and Family: And they being diſcharged of their Impriſonment, I had a further Concern upon me to go to <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> my Friend <hi>T. Ellis</hi> being not willing I ſhould go alone, accompanied me along: So we came to <hi>Aberystwith,</hi> to reſt there the Firſt Day of the Week, and had a Meeting with our Friends, and were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Priſoners, and ſent here to you, and now deſire to know your Pleaſure. The Juſtices anſwered, it was great Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that cauſed me to come and offer myſelf a Priſoner upon ſuch an Account, and they were ſorry that Sir <hi>Richard Frice</hi> gave us that Trouble, as to ſend us there: And ſo they diſcharged us. And the Court being ſilent, I had an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:006833_0077_102A5FB90A291AD0"/>to declare the Word of the Lord among them. Very ſtill and attentive they were, as if I had been in a Meeting; I commended their great Moderation, and in the Love of God we parted with them. The Deputy-ſheriff and the High-conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that brought us there, came out of the Court, and treated us very civilly, and would have beſtowed on us the beſt that the Town could afford, but we were ſparing of taking any Thing of them. I was informed, that the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sheriff and High Conſtable were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and were very loving to Friends all along; and I know not of any that were impriſoned in that County after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The Lord was with us, and he had a Regard to the Integrity of our Hearts, and he alone pleaded our Cauſe, and was with us in our Services.</p>
            <p>Then we took Horſe, and left the Town, and went on towards <hi>Pembroke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> till we came to <hi>Cardigan,</hi> being about 24 Miles. We met with ſome Hardſhip on the Way, having little or no Refreſhment till we came here, where we had very good Entertainment for ourſelves and Horſes; and from thence we had a Friend for our Guide towards <hi>Ponchiſon</hi> in <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> but we were
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:006833_0077_102A5FB90A291AD0"/>benighted, and it rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and our Guide loſt his Way, and we wandered up and down among the Peat, or Turf-pins, and other dangerous Places; but the Lord preſerved us out of them all. And at length we came to <hi>Ponchiſon;</hi> but it being dark, we did not know the Houſe where our Friend that we intended to go to lived, but I ſpoke to our Guide to ſee where their Steeple-houſe Door was, and he brought us to it; then I told them, the Friend's Houſe was oppoſite to it: For I rememb'red when I had a Meeting there, my Back was againſt the Wall of the Houſe, and my Face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Steeple-houſe Door. So we went forward, and found the Houſe; I deſired T. E. to call and tell them, That there were ſome Friends that had loſt their Way, and deſired to have Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there that Night; they, being in Bed, anſwered, they thought that no good Friend was out that Time of Night; T. E. reaſoned a little with them, but ſtill they were not willing to riſe and let us in; at laſt I call'd to the Friend, whoſe Name was <hi>Tho. Simmons,</hi> and to his Wife, and deſired them to riſe and let us come in; and he asked me, who was there? and I told him, in <hi>Welch, Richard Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:006833_0078_102A5FBBB25C7C90"/>was there; what, ſaid he, <hi>Richard Davies</hi> of <hi>Welch-pool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I told them, I was the Man: Thereupon the tender, loving Friends haſtily came down, and let us in to their Houſe, and we were ſatisfied in the Love of God. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Journey that <hi>T. Ellis</hi> made to <hi>Pembrokeſhire</hi> ſince he was convinced.</p>
            <p>Hence we went to <hi>Haverford-weſt,</hi> and ſo through all the Meetings in the County, till we returned to <hi>Ponchiſon;</hi> again, and had a Meeting there, where; there came many Friends, both <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> ſo that the Houſe could not contain us, and we had the Meeting out of Doors in the Street, and I declared the Word of the Lord to them, both in <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we came up to <hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> we went to a <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Houſe, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Houſe being loving and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, promiſed we ſhould have a Meeting among the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> there. We alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Meeting at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marthenſhire, Peregrine Muſgrave, James Lewis,</hi> and ſeveral other Friends accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied us to the Meeting at <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> the Magiſtrates of the Town were very civil, and ſeveral of them came to the Meeting, the Weight and Service of
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:006833_0078_102A5FBBB25C7C90"/>which lay chiefly upon me; for though my Friend and Companion T. E. was reckoned a Deacon, and an eminent Preacher among the <hi>Independents,</hi> yet, his Mouth was but very little opened as yet by Way of Teſtimony among Friends, in was an underſtanding Man in the Things of God, and was not haſty to offer his Offering, till he found a very weighty Concern on him. And as I was declaring to the People in the <hi>Welch</hi> language, I ſtood oppoſite to a great Window that opened to the Street, and there was an evil-minded Man in the Street that had a long Fowling Piece, and he put the Mouth of it through the Window, and ſwore, that if I would ſpeak another Word, I was a dead Man: But bleſſed be God, I was kept in that which was above the Fear of Man, and the Lord kept me in Dominion over all. There were two Women ſitting in the Window, and the Mouth of the Gun came between them both; one of them ſeeing the Gun there, turned her Back upon it, and ſaid in <hi>Welch,</hi> when the Man threat'ned as before, I will die my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf firſt. And there was one in the Meeting went to this Man, and took the Gun away from him; and that bad,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:006833_0079_102A5FBE64D33348"/>wicked Man came into the Meeting, and was pretty quiet there; the Lord's good Preſence was with us, a good Meeting we had, and I may ſay, That <hi>they that truſt in the Lord are as Mount Sion, that cannot be removed.</hi> And it was ſaid of old, <hi>As the Hills ware round about Jerus;alem, ſo is the Lord round about this People, to be a preſent Help to them in every needful Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Pembrokeſhire</hi> Friends and we parted, and it being ſomewhat late, the Meeting having held long, we travelled, all Night over ſome doleful Hills, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be at the <hi>Baptist</hi> Meeting next Day, which we had appointed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, it was by Computation about 24 Miles. In this Time we had little Refreſhment for ourſelves or Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But when we came there, we had no Meeting; the Woman of the Houſe ſaid, That the Magiſtrates had heard of it, and charged them, that we ſhould not have a Meeting there: So the ſlaviſh Fear of Man came over them: The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſeem'd to be ſorrowful, and would have given us ſome Victuals; but I told her, we did not travel ſo hard to come there for her Meat and Drink, but in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Here my Friend and Companion <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ellis</hi> and I parted; he went Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and I went that Night to one <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam ap Hugh</hi>'s Houſe (a Poor Friend, who had a conſiderable Company of ſmall Children) I lay on a little Straw upon a Hurdle of Rods. And when the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeared, I took a Bit of a Cake, and a Cup of clean Water, and <hi>William ap Hugh</hi> and I took our Journey towards <hi>Radnorſhire,</hi> which was about so Miles, moſtly over great Hills; and when I came there, I ſtayed a little while among Friends. And afterwards, I haſt'ned Home to my Family; and when I was come there, <hi>Margaret Bowen,</hi> brought my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Girl to me, and ſaid, here is a Child the Lord hath given thee; ſhe had been Sick near unto Death: Now when I was under my Exerciſe in '<hi>Pembrokeſhire,</hi> one told me, my Child was dead, and my Wife not like to recover; which was Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sorrow to me; and I turned a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aſide from Friends, and the Lord ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied me, that neither my Wife nor Child were dead. And when I came Home, they told me my Child had been as it were raiſed from Death to Life: But bleſſed be the Lord, that reſtored
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:006833_0080_102A5FC0610E3FF0"/>her, and preſerved my Family, and we were comforted in the Lord.</p>
            <p>After this Journey, I ſtay'd a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Time at Home, with my Family and Friends, our Meetings were pretty much ſupplied with Travelling Friends, eſpecially from the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and though we were Priſoners, yet we had our Liberty to go to Meetings A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brond; we had a conſiderable large Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Cloddiecochion,</hi> (the Place now of my abode) near <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> there was at our Meeting, <hi>John ap John,</hi> and <hi>James Adamſon,</hi> a <hi>North</hi> Country Friend; but the Magiſtrates of <hi>Pool</hi> (it being in the Eimits of their Corporation) came and broke up our Meeting, and took us Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; we old Priſoners went to our own Priſon, <hi>i. e.</hi> the County Priſon, and the reſt went to the Corporation Priſon. I took my Friend <hi>John ap John</hi> by the Hand, and told him, he muſt go to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with me: So ſeveral of us went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and when the Hurry was over with them, they let us who were old Priſoners; go to Priſon alone; then I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged our Friend <hi>John ap John,</hi> and I told him, he ſhould be my Priſoner no longer; he ſtay'd a little while with us, and then went homewards. the Jaylor
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:006833_0080_102A5FC0610E3FF0"/>was friendly to us, and after a while; I went to the Magiſtrates, and got them all releaſed that Night, except <hi>James Adamſon.</hi> The Magiſtrates of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gave ſtrict Charge, that if any <hi>North</hi> Country. <hi>Quakers</hi> came that Way they ſhould be ſecured; and I had a great Care upon me, to get them diſcharged, as ſoon as might be; for I knew there was a great Concern upon them, to viſit the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt, whereſoever God ſent them: So when I faw a convenient Time, I went to the Serjeant of the Town, and asked him, by what Auhority he kept my Friend there a Priſoner; and I asked him, whether he had a Commitment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; and he told me, No: Then I deſired him to let him come with me, and I would Anſwer for him. So the Friend came to my Houſe; and Friends and I concluded together to let him go to <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> which was about 12 Miles from <hi>Welch-Pools,</hi> and I deſired him to ſtay there till he ſhould hear from me.</p>
            <p>The Aſſizes being there a few Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the chief Magiſtrate of <hi>Pool</hi> went there, and I went there alſo. And as my Friend <hi>James Adamſon</hi> and I were walking under the Hall at <hi>Srewsbury</hi> we met the Magiſtrate of <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> to
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:006833_0081_102A5FC2DD090F48"/>whom <hi>James</hi> was a Priſoner; he ſeem'd a little angry, becauſe I ſent the Priſoner away, and ask'd me, how I could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it? For, ſaid he, we ſent to the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cherbury,</hi> for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment upon him; I told him, they had kept him too long without a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they could not legally anſwer: Now he knew not that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was with me; ſo I asked him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Diſcourſe, what he would give me for a Sight of the Priſoner; then he conſidered; and asked me, whether the Man that was with me was not his Priſoner; I told him he was (for I knew that he was then out of his Liberty) ſo he ſaid to the Friend, Your Friend hath done you and me a Kindneſs; and I do ſee, that if there had been Occaſion, you would have come again; ſo he part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very friendly with us.</p>
            <p>In theſe Times the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy was tendered to moſt Friends that came into the County, if they were taken; and ſuch were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon, for not taking it, till the next Aſſizes, and then premunired; and then little Hopes of their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from their Impriſonment; and it came to be a Saying, that when any
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:006833_0081_102A5FC2DD090F48"/>
               <hi>Quakers</hi> were taken Priſoners in <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomeryſhire, There would be no End of their Impriſonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Year 1669, my ancient, well beloved and dear Companion <hi>John ap John</hi> and I, took our Journey for <hi>South-Wales,</hi> to viſit our Friends and Brethren in thoſe Parts: We went firſt into <hi>Radnorſhire,</hi> where we had ſeveral good Meetings; and we gave timely No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice before hand, where we appointed the Meetings, and ſeveral Friends and other People came from <hi>Hereforaſhire</hi> to meet us at the lower End of the County of <hi>Radnor,</hi> where we had a ſweet, living Meeting, and the Power of the Lord undered the Hearts of many: We decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Word of the Lord both in <hi>Welch</hi> and in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and my Friend <hi>John ap John</hi> was very ſound and intelligible in the <hi>Welch</hi> Language; he deſerved the Right hand of Fellowſhip, for he was my Elder, and the firſt Friend that I heard declare in a Meeting, in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Tongue; and though he was not perfect in that Language, yet he had the Tongue of the Learned, to ſuch who were ſpiritual. And when that Meeting was ended in <hi>Radnorſhire,</hi> we both withdrew a little aſide from Friends, being bowed
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:006833_0082_102A5FC463E1E9C0"/>before the Lord, in a Senſe of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt us. So after a little while, I turned my Face towards the Friends, and I ſaw a Man coming towards me with much Brokenneſs and Tears, when he came, he took me in his Arms, and field me there, and I was very tender of him; though I knew him not; he asked me whether I did not know him? and I told him I did not; though I ſaid, I could remember ſomething of him: He ſaid he had Cauſe to remember me. And when I looked upon him again, I asked him whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was not <hi>Roger Prichard?</hi> And he ſaid, he was the Man that had gone aſtray. And I was glad, yea very glad, that the loſt Sheep was found, and that he came to know the true Shepherd and his Voice in himſelf, and he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and went not aſtray again, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he did before; and he accompanied us to ſeveral Meetings in that County, and in <hi>Monmouthſhire.</hi> And as we were parting with him, <hi>John ap John</hi> told him, he had come far out of his Way with us: He anſwered, we put him in his right Way again, and he hoped he ſhould keep in it.</p>
            <p>So we went through <hi>Monmouthſhire,</hi> and <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> viſiting Friends; we
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:006833_0082_102A5FC463E1E9C0"/>had a good Meeting at a Place called <hi>Scilly,</hi> and at <hi>Swanzy</hi> in <hi>Glamorganſhire;</hi> where we met ſome <hi>French Britains;</hi> we could underſtand ſomething of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; we found they were paſſionate among themſelves.</p>
            <p>From thence we paſſed to <hi>Carmarthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> we had a Meeting at <hi>Cardiff,</hi> and lodged at one <hi>John Mayo</hi>'s, and his Wife <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was as a Nurſing-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Friends in the Beginning. At <hi>Cardiff, John ap John,</hi> ſuffered great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and in other Parts of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, before I was convinced, I ſuppoſe he might be Priſoner in 1653, or 1654.</p>
            <p>We went thence towards <hi>Pembroke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> where we had ſeveral good Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Lord was with us. Then we came homewards; but before we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Roger Prichard,</hi> we appointed a Meeting at his Houſe, which was in <hi>Almeley Wooton;</hi> the Lord helped us on in our Journey and we came there accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Time appointed, and a large, ſweet, comfortable Meeting we had there; I know not that any Meeting had been there before; I appointed another Meeting to be there; and in a few Weeks after my Return Home, I went there my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf accordingly. The Concern of that
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:006833_0083_102A5FC716566A10"/>Part of the Country in <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> was much upon me, and I was often there; and when the People of that Village would ſee me come, they would ſay one to another, <hi>Come, let us go to Mr.</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard's, <hi>for we ſhall have Prayers there to Night;</hi> and the Houſe hath been ſoon near full of People, and a comfortable Time we uſed to have together, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were gathered to the Lord in thoſe Parts. And as for <hi>Roger Prichard,</hi> the Lord bleſſed him in his Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ket, and in his Store, and his Heart and Houſe were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Friends, and he built a fine Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſe at his own Charge, and alſo gave a Burying-place, and ſettled both upon Friends for that Service, and lived and died in Love and Favour with God, and in Unity with his Brethren: <hi>Say to the Righteous, it ſhall go well with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this Time I was pretty much at Home; and the Enemy and Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Growth and Proſperity of Truth in theſe Parts, ſtirr'd up an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer againſt us, one <hi>John David,</hi> alias <hi>Pugh,</hi> a Weaver, one who was a Tenant to the Goaler, and we had our Meeting in an upper Room in our Priſon, and the ſaid Informer dwelt below; and
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:006833_0083_102A5FC716566A10"/>once, as he was coming by my Barns, where my Cattle were, he ſaid to ſome of my Neighbours. Theſe Cattle are all mine: They asked him, how they were his? He ſaid, <hi>Richard Davies</hi> hath preached three Times this Day, and that by the Laws there is 60 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> on the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the ſame. By this it was noiſed about in the Town, that I was like to be undone; my Neighbours ſeem'd to be concern'd thereat; and on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Aldermen, that was a Relation of mine, came chidingly to me, and asked me whether I had a Mind to ruin my Wife and Family? Could I not leave my Preaching, when I knew the Laws were to ſevere againſt us? I told him, I could not, when the Lord required it of me. I deſired him to let the Informer alone, and let him take his Courſe. He ſaid he would not; but ſaid he, I will tell thee what I will do, I will take him along with me to <hi>Severn</hi> Side, and whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my Knife very ſharp, and I will cut off one of the Rogue's Ears; and if ever he informs againſt thee again, I will cut off the other. I earneſtly deſired him to let him alone; but he and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were ſo enraged againſt him, that I was afraid they would have done him
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:006833_0084_102A5FC8A43A6DE8"/>ſome Miſchief in one Place or another.</p>
            <p>This Informer was a Weaver by Trade, and the Neighbours took their Work away from him, ſo that his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren went ſoon after a begging, many of the Town telling them, Their Father had got a new, rich Trade in Hand, and that they need not give them any Thing. So the poor Children ſuffer'd very much; but my Wife did not with-hold her Hand of Charity towards them.</p>
            <p>One Time I had my Boots on ready to go out, the Jaylor, that was this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former's Landlord, ſeeing him come up the Street towards my Houſe, I being in the Street, he ſaid to the Informer, Mr. <hi>Informer,</hi> you ſee <hi>Richard Davies</hi> is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to Preach ſomewhere to Day, and I adviſe you to look diligently after your Buſineſs, and find him out; and if you will not inform againſt him, I will inform againſt you: You have got a good Trade in Hand; and if you do this great Service for the King, you muſt needs have either <hi>Dolobran</hi> or <hi>Caedcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid</hi> for your Pains. The one was the Manſion-houſe, and the other the Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-houſe that belonged to my Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd,</hi> and his Anceſtors. And thus the Jaylor jeer'd him; and the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:006833_0084_102A5FC8A43A6DE8"/>poor Informer travell'd great Part of that Day from one Friend's Houſe to another, to ſee for me, till he came to <hi>Dolobran,</hi> where we were met upon the Church Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and as we were coming from the Meeting, I met him at the Door, and diſcourſed a little with him; he told us, that he was going for a Warrant againſt us to <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Herbert:</hi> I felt the Power of God was over him, and Truth reigned among us. He went to the ſaid Lord, and deſired a Warrant againſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> asked him, what did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he <hi>Quakers</hi> do? He ſaid, they Preached. He queried of him, where did they Preach? He told the Lord, they preached in his Houſe, which was their Priſon. The Lord anſwered, let 'em Preach there as long as they will, what have I to ſay to them? But the <hi>Informer</hi> told the Lord, that they did meet at <hi>Cloddiecochion;</hi> he asked him, whether thoſe there were not Priſoners? He anſwered, they were, Then ſaid the Lord, what do they do at <hi>Cloddiecochion?</hi> do they Preach there? He ſaid, No, their Way was to ſit down, and to look one upon another. The Lord anſwered, thou art but a Fool; the <hi>Quakers</hi> be a loving People, they went
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:006833_0085_102A5FCAC6E7E9F0"/>to viſit their Children, and to eat Bread and Cheeſe with them.</p>
            <p>So the Lord took his Cane, and went from him with his Gentleman to walk in his Park; this Informer followed them, and ſpoke again to the Lord, and ſaid, Will you be pleaſed to grant me a Warrant againſt the <hi>Quakers?</hi> The Lord asked him, who ſent him there for a Warrant? And he ſaid, Dr. <hi>Davies.</hi> [This was the preſent Prieſt of <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool,</hi> and a peaceable Man, and no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor.] The Lord asked him again, whether he had a Letter from him? The Informer ſaid, No, he thought his Word might be ſufficient to get a Warrant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Upon this the Lord with Indignation (it is thought) would have ſpoil'd him had not his Gentleman interpos'd. The Lord ſaid to him, Is it not ſufficient to put my peaceable Neighbours in Priſon? Muſt I give a Warrant to make ſuch a Rogue as this is rich, by uining them and their Families? So the Informer return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Home, and as I was going by his Houſe, he deſired me to walk in, for he had ſomething to ſay to me: So I went in with him, and he ſaid to me, I am ſorry I did you ſo much Wrong, for I
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:006833_0085_102A5FCAC6E7E9F0"/>Intended much Evil againſt you; I was put on to be an Informer, which proved to be mine and my Childrens R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in; for my Neighbours took their Work from me, and when my Children went to their Doors, they would ſcarce give them my Thing to relieve them: And now I deſire you to pray to God to forgive me; and I pray you to forgive me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for I think moſt of our Biſhops are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and there is no Truſt to be put in them. I deſired him to have a Care what he ſaid, and not lay the Fault there; for it was the Enemy, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, the Devil, that begot that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Mind in him againſt his peaceable Neighbours. So I deſired the Lord to forgive him; and as for me, and my Friends, we would forgive him; and I deſired him to go his Way, and to do ſo no more. So he never inform'd againſt us afterwards.</p>
            <p>And thus the Lord helped us, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved us through great Hardſhips and Difficulties. There was nothing taken from us at this Time, upon this Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Account.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1675. we heard that there was a ſevere Perſecution by Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in <hi>Merionethſhire,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llyn,</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="unknown:006833_0086_102A5FCE4728DAF0"/>near <hi>Bala;</hi> in which Time our Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>;</hi> there was abundance of People, more than the Houſe could hold. Two Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers came in, and ſtaid there all the Meeting while; and after we had clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ourſelves, by Way of Teſtimony, the Underſtandings of the People were very much opened in the Things of God, and the Way to his Kingdom, in the <hi>Welch</hi> Language in which I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Meeting, the Lord owning of us with his great Power and Preſence, to our great Comfort, and the Satisfaction of the Auditory. The two Informers kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their Knees with us, while I was at Prayer, and one of them (call'd <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Evans</hi>) did exceedingly tremble; and when I had concluded the Meeting the ſaid <hi>R.

               </gap> what the Tenure of his Warrant was, and who the Juſtices of the Peace were what did ſign it. So we went along with him to the Houſe, where he ſaid we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>oul I ſee it; but the Man of the Houſe not being within, he was ſtill loth we ſhould ſee it: We told him, He ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="152" facs="unknown:006833_0087_102A5FD1699372A8"/>and we were concerned to go and viſit theſe Juſtices. In the firſt place we went to ſee whether we could ſpeak with <hi>Price</hi> of <hi>Rhiwlas,</hi> to lay the Sufferings of Friends, that were his Neighbours and Tenants before him, for many of them were his Tenants; but we could not ſee him, though we heard he was at Home.

Some told us he was: But when we came there, they perceived we were theſe People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> by our Habit and Language; and he being conſcious to himſelf what he had done, and what Spoil was made upon Friends Goods, would not admit us to ſpeak with him. We deſired one of his Servants to acquaint him, that we had come a great Way to viſit our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Friends in that County; and my Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> bid him tell him who he was; for it ſeems he was his Relation, and an old School fellow. From thence we went to <hi>John ap John</hi>'s, near <hi>Wrexham,</hi> in <hi>Denbighſhire,</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Friends there; and from thence we came Home to our Families, where we

            <p>Some Time after this, it lay upon me to go and viſit Friends in <hi>London;</hi> and I went to ſee the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> and his Lady (who dwelt then at <hi>London</hi>) they were my particular Friends; and I acquainted them with the Sufferings of our Friends in <hi>Merionethſhire</hi> by Informers upon the ſate Act? And they asked me, Which Way they might be helpful to Friends? I told them, that if they would be pleaſed to get a few Lines from their Brother the Duke of <hi>Beanford,</hi> who was then Lord-Preſident of <hi>Wales,</hi> to Colonel <hi>Price</hi> of <hi>Rhiwlas,</hi> I did not queſtion but that would moderate them very much: For the ſaid Colonel was not in the main a Perſecutor, but was put on by ſome peeviſh Clergy-men (ſo called) in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Time they got his Letter for me, with his own Seal thereon, but not ſeal'd up; the Tenure of it was thus: <hi>Sir, I have ſtopp'd the Complaint of his Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, call a</hi> Quakers, <hi>from coming before the Council-Board, concerning the ſevere Proſecution of the Penal Laws againſt them.</hi> So when I had this Letter, I made what haſte I could down into the Country, and gave it to a Friend and
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:006833_0088_102A5FD42944B280"/>Relation of Colonel <hi>Price</hi>'s, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it into his own Hand: And it had good Effect; and the Lord was pleaſed thereby to ſtop the Rage and the Ruin that was intended againſt Friends in that County: And the Juſtices of the Peace called the Informer to an Account for what he had done to, and taken from Friends, but he could not make up his Account; the moderate Juſtices followed him ſo cloſe, in Behalf of the King, that he was near ruin'd and undone thereby. So it happened that himſelf fell into the Snare and Evil that he intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Some Time afterwards, one <hi>Price,</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Llanvawr</hi> in <hi>Merionethſhire,</hi> was ſevere againſt Friends for Tythes, and ſome Friends came down to me to <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> with an Account thereof: I conſidered his Proceeding upon a <hi>Quo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> from the Exchequer, and I cauſed an Attorney to appear for the Friends, and he, in a few Terms, brought me a Writ of Charges againſt the Prieſt; and when I had it, I was in a great Streight what to do with it, for I knew that if the Prieſt was taken upon it, it would exaſperate him againſt Friends; I ſent for ſome of theſe Friends to be at our Quarterly
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:006833_0088_102A5FD42944B280"/>Meeting at <hi>Dolobran,</hi> which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to: I told them what my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in the Matter, and how, that though there was a Writ obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prieſt, yet it was not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have it executed; but I told them. I thought that it would be more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them, to take the Writ, and ſhew it to the Deputy-Sheriff, and tell him the whole Caſe; but to take Care that the Writ ſhould not be left with him; which was well approved of, and Friends did accordingly, and kept the Writ. The Deputy-Sheriff knew what would be for the Advantage of Friends, and he was ready to do what he could for them: So he blazed it abroad, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> had got a Writ againſt the Prieſt; and the poor Prieſt was afraid of coming to the Steeple-Houſe for ſeveral Days, to perform his Service; ſo he imployed ſomebody to come to Friends to make an End of the Matter, and I never heard that he troubled Friends again for Tythe, while he was there.</p>
            <p>About this Time, whilſt I was at <hi>London</hi> viſiting Friends, there ſprung up a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, whoſe Name was <hi>David Maurice,</hi> he lived at a Place called <hi>Pon-y-bont</hi> in <hi>Denbighſhire,</hi> and was newly made a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:006833_0089_102A5FD7456C07F0"/>of the Peace of the County of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery;</hi> he that recommended him, informed that he was a ſober Man, and not given to Perſecution; but ſoon after he had his Commiſſion, he appeared to be a great Perſecutor, not only of our Friends; but of other Diſſenters alſo.</p>
            <p>He the ſaid <hi>David Maurice</hi> (upon the 7th Day of the firſt Month called <hi>March,</hi> 1674-5.) came into a Meeting at <hi>Cloddiecochion,</hi> with about 14 or 15 Perſons, moſt of them armed, where a ſmall Number of our Friends were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Silence upon the Lord, he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted us to de art; our Friend <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> requeſted of him a Quarter of an Hour's Time before he diſperſed them, which he readily granted, and he and his Followers ſat amongſt 'em; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> uttered a few Words by Way of defining the true Religion, and what the true Worſhip was; all which the ſaid <hi>David Maurice</hi> approv'd of as ſound, and according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Yet notwithſtanding he fined him the ſaid <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> 20 <abbr>l.</abbr> for Preaching, though he was no Magiſtrate of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, and he fined the Houſe 20 <abbr>l.</abbr> and 5 <abbr>s.</abbr> a Piece for the Hearers. And
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:006833_0089_102A5FD7456C07F0"/>on the 16th of the 4th Month, 1675, he cauſed to be driven from the ſaid <hi>Tho. Lloyd,</hi> 4 Cows and a Mare, all worth about 16 <abbr>l.</abbr> by two of his Servants, one of them being his Clerk, and the other his Tenant, and no Officer of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, nor of the Pariſh, nor of that Allotment of the Hundred, in Place with them; theſe Drivers were lurking near the Ground about 2 Hours before Day, and drove away the Cattle before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and they were brought out of the County into his own Demeſns.</p>
            <p>The ſame Day, about the Dawning thereof, the ſaid Drivers, by a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the ſaid <hi>David Maurice,</hi> rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke through a Neighbour's Fields, to the Ground of <hi>Thomas Lewis,</hi> of <hi>Cloddiecochion,</hi> aforeſaid, and drove from him 6 Cows, 2 Oxen, and 2 Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers: Alledging for his Offence, that the ſaid <hi>T. Lewis</hi> ſuffered a Meeting to be at his Houſe, though the ſaid <hi>David Maurice</hi> was at that Meeting himſelf, and not only allowed of the Time, but approved of what was ſpoken there.</p>
            <p>About the ſame Time <hi>Charles Lloyd,</hi> of <hi>Dolobran,</hi> had Ten young Beaſts ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him by <hi>John Jones,</hi> of <hi>Goly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nog,</hi> an Attorney at Law, who was that
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:006833_0090_102A5FD8CC9DFB00"/>Year an Overſeer of the Poor in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Myvod,</hi> together with the Petty Conſtable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon a Warrant from the ſaid <hi>David Maurice,</hi> the only Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and buſy Juſtice, upon this merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Act, in our Borders, for Preaching at <hi>Cloddiecochion,</hi> within the Liberties of <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> the 14th of 1ſt Month, 1674-5. Though the ſaid <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> was not at that Place that Day, nor for many Days before nor after at any Meeting. <hi>David Jones,</hi> of <hi>Branyarth,</hi> for being a Hearer at the ſaid Meeting at <hi>Cloddiecochion,</hi> had a Braſs Pan for his own proper Fines taken from him, and one Cow for the pretended Inability of others convicted, upon a Warrant from the ſaid <hi>David Maurice,</hi> of <hi>Pen-y-bont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But nothing was taken from me, though my Family was at the Meeting, and I lived within the Limits of the Corporation.</p>
            <p>Now I being at this Time in <hi>London,</hi> and my Service there pretty much in the Time of the ſaid hard Perſecution; my dear Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd,</hi> ſent me up a full and large Account of the Sufferings of Friends there; by the ſaid wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, <hi>David Maurice,</hi> and when I had read and conſidered them, I was under
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:006833_0090_102A5FD8CC9DFB00"/>a great Exerciſe, what Way to take to prevent the further intended Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of this Man, and I laid their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and faithful Sufferings in ſecret before the great God of Heaven, who hath the Hearts of all Men in his Hand, and may order them as ſeemeth Good to him.</p>
            <p>Now after this, when the Time of the Quarter-Seſſions was come, the Clerk of the Peace told the Court, he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed new Commiſſions; which being read, and this <hi>D. M.</hi> being then preſent, and finding himſelf left out, fell into a great Rage and Paſſion.</p>
            <p>In a little Time the ſaid <hi>D. Maurice</hi> went to <hi>London,</hi> and was put into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion again: But being made High-Sheriff of the County this Year, he could not act as a Juſtice of the Peace; ſo he fell into a great Rage, for that the ſaid Office was like to be chargeable to him. So that Year we had Peace and Quietneſs; and when his Sheriff ſhip was over, he was coming through a Brook called <hi>Lynlleth,</hi> near his own Houſe at <hi>Pen-y-bont,</hi> and it was ſuppoſed that his Florſe threw him down, and he was carried down into the River <hi>Tannat,</hi> a
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:006833_0091_102A5FDACC5925E8"/>conſiderable Way, and there miſerably periſhed.</p>
            <p>In the latter End of the Year, 1674, I went to viſit my ancient, dear Friend <hi>George Fox,</hi> who was a Priſoner in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> I paſſed through <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and had ſome Meetings there; I ſtaid with my Friend <hi>G. F.</hi> for ſome Time; he told me how he was taken Priſoner, and that he was indicted for refuſing the Oath of Allegiance, and how he had been twice removed by an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and that he had had his Trial there, and no Error being found in his Indictment, he was returned back again to his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at <hi>Worceſter.</hi> And as he was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Caſe to me, I thought there might be ſufficient Errors found in his Indictment to get him diſcharged; I told him of a Counſellor, one <hi>Thomas Corbet,</hi> who was a Friend of mine that was then at <hi>London,</hi> who was very excellent at finding out Errors; ſo after ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, he ſent next Poſt for a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus,</hi> which ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> down in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Time, and the Sheriff was ſerved with it; ſo we ſet forward, <hi>G. Fox</hi> went in the Coach with the Sheriff and Clerk of the Peace of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and d<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rid
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:006833_0091_102A5FDACC5925E8"/>on my Horſe along with the Coach, and no other Friend with us.</p>
            <p>We came to <hi>London,</hi> the 8th Day of the 12th Month, and when we came there, ſeveral Firends much admired, that he ſhould be removed up again; for he was ſomething private in the Matter. So I deſired the Friends, who had the Management of the Buſineſs before, to let me have a Copy of the Record, which was pretty difficult to be had; for ſeve al thought it was to little or no Purpoſe: But <hi>G. F.</hi> being uneaſy, was not ſatisfied till I had it. I had acquainted Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <hi>Corbet</hi> of the whole Caſe, as far as I could underſtand it, before I could ſee a Copy of the Record; and about the 10th Hour in the Night, <hi>William Mead</hi> came with me to Counſellor <hi>Corbet</hi> with it; and when he had read it, he ſaid, There were ſeveral material Errors in it; which put <hi>W. Mead</hi> to a Conſideration, how that could be; and he deſired the counſellor to ſhew him one Error. The Counſellor ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d him ſeveral Errors; and <hi>W. Mead</hi> ſeem'd to wonder that ſuch great Errors could not have been found out by other Counſel.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, being the 11th Day of the 12th Month, we went to
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:006833_0092_102A5FDD1C270FD0"/>Court, where ſome other Counſellors moved firſt on <hi>G.</hi> F's Behalf, and they were pretty cloſe upon ſome Things, but they knew not of any Errors in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment: All this while Counſellor <hi>Corbet</hi> was ſilent. There was one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor <hi>Walcott,</hi> who was againſt <hi>G. Fox</hi> (and fearing leſt they ſhould find ſome Errors in the Indictment) he moved that the Oath ſhould be tender'd again to <hi>G. F.</hi> Upon which Counſellor <hi>Corbet</hi> ſtood up and moved, That there was no Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment in Caſe of Premunire. Where upon the Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> you ſhould have come ſooner, at the Beginning of the Term, with that Plea. He anſwered, We could not get a Copy of the Return, and of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Judge replied, You ſhould have told us, and we would have forced them to have made Return ſooner. Then ſaid Judge <hi>Wild,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> you go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on general Terms, and if it be ſo as you ſay, we have committed many Errors at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and in other Courts. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> was poſitive, that by Law they could not impriſon upon a Premunire. The Judge ſaid, There is Summons in the Statute. Yes, ſaid <hi>Corbet,</hi> but Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is not Impriſonment; for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:006833_0092_102A5FDD1C270FD0"/>is in order to a Trial. Well, ſaid the Judge, we muſt have Time to look in our Books, and conſult the Statutes: So the Hearing was put off till the next Day. As we were going out of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>-Hall, ſome Friends were much troubled, that the <hi>Welch</hi> Counſellor ſhould ſtart ſuch a Plea, contrary to the Opinion of the Judges, and all the Counſellors; and ſome of them ſaid, they thought <hi>G. F.</hi> would have been diſcharged if the Counſellor had not put in that Plea: But honeſt, plain <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid he had a fine Trial, and he was chearful in his Spirit. I deſired Friends to have a little Patience, for I thought the <hi>Welch</hi> Counſellor would ſtand upon his own Legs. So I went to the Hall again, and ſtaid for Counſellor <hi>Corbet</hi> till the Court was up; and when I found him, I told him he ſtarted that up that many thought he could not make good; and if ſo, it would be a Reflection upon me, and the <hi>Welch</hi> Counſellor, as they called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. He deſired me to bring him that Evening another Copy of the Record beſides what he had. So I got one, and went with it to him; and he writ in the Margent ſomething in <hi>Brench,</hi> and give it me again, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:006833_0093_102A5FDEAFC00F60"/>me to go with it to <hi>Thomas Rudyard,</hi> who was an Attorney in <hi>London</hi> for <hi>G. F.</hi> and deſire him to deliver it that Night to Judge <hi>Hales,</hi> and he would take the other himſelf to Judge <hi>Wild;</hi> and then he thought there would be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Diſcourſe of that Matter more: And ſo it happened. For,</p>
            <p>The next Day, they choſe rather to let that Plea fall, and begin with the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Indictment; and when they came to be opened, they were ſo many and ſo groſs, that the Judges were all of Opinion, that the Indictment was quaſh'd and void, and that <hi>G.F.</hi> ought to have his Liberty: Upon which Proclamation was made, That if any had any Thing to ſay againſt <hi>G. Fox,</hi> let them come forth and they ſhall be heard, otherwiſe he is diſcharged. And ſo he was ſet at Liberty.</p>
            <p>Counſellor <hi>Corbet,</hi> who pleaded this Cauſe, got great Fame by it; for many of the Lawyers came to him, and told him, He had brought that to Light, which had not been kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> before, as to the not Impriſoning upon a Preminire. And after the Trial, a Judge ſaid to him, You have attained a great deal of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by Pleading <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Cauſe ſo in Court.</p>

As we were coming out of the Court, I had an Opportunity to ſpeak to ſome of <hi>London,</hi> and to blame them for their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; becauſe they could not believe, that any Good could come from that Plea: I was then of the Mind, and ſtill am, that the Hand of the Lord was in it, more than the Wit and Cunning of Man; for that Trial put an End to all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munires in the Nation. Our Friends, in this County of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> were moſt of them under a Sentence of Premunire for many Years. Our Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> was not ſuffer'd to ſee his own Honſe for ſeveral Years, altho' it was but about five Miles from <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> where he was kept a Priſoner. And as for my ſelf, I had the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of being a Priſoner on the ſame Account for about Seven Years, but was not kept cloſe Priſoner in all that Time, but I had my Freedom and Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p>So, <hi>Good is the Lord, and good is his Word, and worthy is he to be praiſed by all that know him, from henceforth and for ever.</hi>

1677. Some Years after this Trial of <hi>G. F</hi>'s at <hi>London,</hi> Counſellor <hi>Walcott,</hi> who was a Counſellor againſt him, was made Judge of three Counties in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> viz. <hi>Merionethſhire, Carnarvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Angleſey;</hi> he began his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit in a Town call'd <hi>Bala,</hi> in <hi>Merion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethſhire,</hi> he cauſed ſeveral Friends to be brought before him, and he tendered them the Oath of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and he did not intend to proceed againſt them by Premunire, but ſaid, The Refuſal of thoſe Oaths was High-Treaſon, and he would proceed againſt them upon that Statute for their Lives the next Affizes; threat'ning, that the Men ſhould be hanged, and the Women burned. He was a wicked, hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man, and intended much Miſchief to Friends, if the Lord had not prevented him. So Friends of that County ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us here of the whole Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in that Affair; it being the Time that the Parliament was ſitting; Friends concluded, that our Friend <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> ſhould go up to <hi>London</hi> immediately, and we deſired him to adviſe with Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor <hi>Corbet</hi> (who was then in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) what to do in the Matter; and when Counſellor <hi>Corbet</hi> heard of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:006833_0094_102A5FE4B6D91788"/>he was much concerned about it, for he was very well acquainted with this <hi>Walcott;</hi> and he ſaid, By that Way they might try us all, if <hi>Popery</hi> came up again; for they have (ſaid he) the Law (or Writ) <hi>De Haeretico Comburendo</hi> in Force, which was executed in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days for the Burning of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which was not repealed to this Day. So Counſellor <hi>Corbet</hi> and <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> went to the Parliament Houſe, and acquainted ſeveral Parliament-men of it, and that Seſſions it was repealed; and Judge <hi>Walcott</hi> was ſpoken to in <hi>London,</hi> and our Friends were no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecuted, but had their Liberty: And bleſſed be the Lord, Friends had great Peace and Quietneſs in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for a conſiderable Time afterwards. And in a few Years this Judge <hi>Walcott</hi> died; and ſo there was an End of that Perſecutor.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1677. our Friend <hi>John Burnyeat</hi> came to give us a Viſit in <hi>Wales.</hi> and had a Meeting at a Town called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynlleth</hi> in <hi>Montgomeryſhire,</hi> where there appeared an Informer, one <hi>Oliver Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> of <hi>Drain Llwidion</hi> in <hi>Merionethſhire,</hi> and cauſed Diſturbance there; and went afterwards to one <hi>William Pugh</hi> of <hi>Math<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afern,</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="unknown:006833_0095_102A384367BE6C58"/>near <hi>Machynlleth</hi> aforeſaid, a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Peace for this County (he was one of them that had his Commſſion when <hi>D.

Burnyeat</hi>'s Mare died within an Hour and a Half af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seizure; and <hi>T. Ellis</hi>'s Horſe died in the Informer's Hands in Half a Year's Time; in which Time alſo a Diſtemper infected moſt of his Cattle, whereby he ſuffered very great Loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>: the ſaid Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice likewiſe fined ſeveral other Friends at the ſame Time, though they lived in another County. <hi>Thomas Ellis</hi> diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Meſſenger down to me at <hi>Welch Pod,</hi> being about 22 Miles. The next Day, the Lord of <hi>Powis</hi> being at Home, at his Caſtle of <hi>Powis,</hi> I went to him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him thereof; and when he heard it, he was very ſorry. I deſired of him, that he would grant me that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make Uſe of his Name, that he heard ſuch and ſuch Things concerning
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:006833_0095_102A384367BE6C58"/>the beforeſaid Juſtice: Not only ſo, ſaid he, but let Mr. <hi>Edmond Lloyd</hi> (this was a neighbouring Juſtice, and no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor) write to him, and tell him, that I am angry with him for ſuch Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. So I went to my Friend, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtice, and I got him to write a few Lines to the ſaid <hi>W.

But <hi>John Burnyaet</hi>'s Mare was dead, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related.</p>
            <p>Some Time after there was in this C. of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> one <hi>Hughes,</hi> Prieſt in the Pariſh of <hi>Hirnant,</hi> where lived a Friend, one <hi>John Rhydderch,</hi> an honeſt Man, who conſcienciouſly refuſed to pay Tythe: This Prieſt having got Judgment againſt him out of the County Court, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Cattle were drave away on that Account by the Sheriff's Bailiffs; but our Friend being well acquainted with the Deputy-ſheriff, inform'd him of the Errors in theſe Proceedings; and the Sheriff ordered the Bailiffs to return the Friend his Cattle: The Prieſt was in a great Fret, that he loſt all that Charge. And after that, the Prieſt ordered the Friend to beſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Ludlow</hi> Court, which was for the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:006833_0096_102A5FE845B6C4C0"/>Marches of <hi>Wales.</hi> This Court was a great Yoke and Bondage to Friends in this Dominion; for all Anſwers were to be given upon Oath in that Court, which Friends could not do for Conſcience Sake. This Prieſt followed the Friend with one Contempt after another, till it came to a Writ of Rebellion: We let him go on as far as he could, till the Friend was ready to be taken; our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney that we did employ gave us, an Account of it, and I deſired the Friend to go to a Friend's Houſe in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> which was out of the Juriſdiction of that Court and ſtay there till he ſhould hear from me. And I ſent to <hi>London</hi> to <hi>John Lloyd,</hi> Brother to <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Dolobran,</hi> who belonged to the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Office, and he ſent me down a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and I ſent to ſerve the Prieſt and Attorney with it: The Prieſt fell into a very great Rage, and his Attorney came to him for Seven Pounds Charge that he laid out for him, but the Prieſt would not pay him; ſo the Attorney ſued him, and got Judgment againſt him, that the poor Prieſt could not go to perform his wonted Service for ſome Time. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Prieſt died, and I know not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="171" facs="unknown:006833_0096_102A5FE845B6C4C0"/>his Money; and that Friend was never troubled after on Account of that Suit.</p>
            <p>Our Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Dolobran,</hi> was ſued for Tythe at the great Aſſizes held for this County of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> Impropriator, and <hi>Randal Davies,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Myvod,</hi> the Pariſh that our Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> lived in; we were ſatisfied it was a Court of Record, and they might ſue for treble Damage for not paying Tythe: So we concluded to go with a Copy of their Declaration to Counſellor <hi>Corbet,</hi> who lived then at <hi>Welch-pool,</hi> and when he read it, he ſaid, he would demur to it; I asked him whether he could damur in the Caſe of Tythe; he ſaid, he would maintain a Demurrer to that Declaration; ſo when the Court ſat, he acquainted the Judge that he would demur to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; the Judge ſaid, Demur in the Caſe of Tythe? Yes, in this Caſe, ſaid he: Then the Judge asked him, whether he would demur ſpecial or general? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="172" facs="unknown:006833_0097_102A5FEBD1C1F5A0"/>mended the Declaration, and next Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes they obtained Judgment upon <hi>Nihil dicit.</hi> And ſo <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi>'s Cattle were driven for treble Damage, but the Prieſt was ſo perplexed, and put to Charge and Trouble, that I do not know he ever ſued any Friend for Tythe again.</p>
            <p>After this I went to <hi>London</hi> to the Yearly Meeting, and continued there ſometime, in and about the City, and ſo came leiſurely down through ſeveral Meetings, viſiting Friends; and while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I came Home, <hi>Thomas Ellis</hi> and <hi>James Halladay</hi> came to our Town, I told <hi>James</hi> it was well done in him to give us a Viſit in theſe Parts of <hi>Wales;</hi> they ſaid, they came to viſit us againſt their Wills; I asked them, whether they were Priſoners? they ſaid, they were: And ſoon after came other Friends along with them, I took them all with me to my Houſe to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they told me, that <hi>James Halli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> came from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>South-Wales,</hi> intending to take Shipping t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>About the Year 1680, or 1681, there came one Dr. <hi>William Lloyd,</hi> late of <hi>Martins</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> to be Biſhop of this Dioceſs, called St. <hi>Aſaph;</hi> Perſecution was very ſharp and ſevere in ſeveral Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about this Time, upon Account of Excommunication, and the Statute of 20 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> a Month. But this new Biſhop thought to take a more mild Way to work, by ſummoning all Sorts of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to diſcourſe with him, and to ſeek to perſwade them to turn to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and among the reſt, when he came to <hi>Welch-pool</hi> in his Viſitation, he ſent for us; ſo <hi>Charles Lloyd, Thomas Lloyd,</hi> and myſelf, waited, ſeeking to ſpeak with him: But I was that Day bound for <hi>London,</hi> ſo I could not ſpeak with him; but my Friends ſtaid till they had an Opportunity with him; and my Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> gave me an
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:006833_0099_102A5FF24D498CE0"/>Account afterwards, of what paſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which was to this Effect, in ſhort:</p>
            <p>How that the Biſhop was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed that I was abſent, and when he was told of my urgent Occaſions to go, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y Stay on Purpoſe ſome while to ſee him; he ſaid, His Buſineſs was greater, whatever my Buſineſs was. That Day they diſcourſed with him, his Chaplains, and other Clergy, ſo called, from about 2 in the Afternoon, till 2 in the Morning; afterwards they diſcourſed with him, two other Days at <hi>Llanvilling.</hi> The firſt Day, from about 2 in the Afternoon, till Night; and the next Day, from 10 in the Morning, till an Hour in the Night, publickly in the Town-Hall. The firſt Day at <hi>Pool,</hi> our ſaid Friends <hi>C. L.</hi> and <hi>Y. L.</hi> gave their Reaſons of Separation; but in none of the three Days, would the Biſhop and his Clergy defend their own Principles, or refute ours: But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held the three Days, on the general Principles of Chriſtendom, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtiles Examples of <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> and once a ſmall Touch at the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine. Thomas Lloyd,</hi> held the laſt Day, our Reaſons why we ſeparated from the Church of England: which were</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe their Miniſtry, was no Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe their Ordinances were no Goſpel Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they would not join with him to prove any of them, though often ſollicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto; but Friends being Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſubmit to all Diſadvantages: For they had not any Notice before-hand of what Matters they ſhould argue, till they came to the Place of Diſpute; and the laſt Day, they forced <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> to about 28 Syllogiſms, all written down as they diſputed, to be anſwered extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore; and the Biſhop ſaid he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſo much could be ſaid by any on that Subject, on ſo little Warning. And he ſaid, That he expected not to find ſo much <hi>Civility</hi> from the <hi>Quakers;</hi> he highly commended <hi>Thomas Lloyd;</hi> and our ſaid Friends came off with them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. They had alſo much Diſcourſe with the Chancellor, and with one <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dodwell,</hi> and the Dean of <hi>Bangor,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> very learned Men, who were alſo at the Diſpute, with many of the Clergy of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſs, with ſome Juſtices of the Peace,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:006833_0100_102A5FF3F8131270"/>and Deputy Lieutenants of the County, and a great Concourſe of People, in the Town-Hall, aforeſaid, in <hi>Llanvilling.</hi> Several of the Clergy, with whom I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diſcourſed, ſeemed not well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with that Diſpute: For they ſaid, they thought that the Validity of <hi>Water Baptiſm</hi> was much weakened thereby; and ſeveral noted Men, that were preſent at the ſaid Diſpute: ſaid, that they thought there could not be ſo much ſaid againſt <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> as had been ſaid there: But it was agreed by Conſent of all Parties concerned, that the Diſpute ſhould not be printed.</p>
            <p>About this Time I ſtay'd a pretty while in <hi>London;</hi> and when the Lord made Way for me, I took my Leave of the City Friends, letting them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that I was preparing Homewards, intending for my Priſon upon the Writ <hi>De Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi> that was out againſt me, and our Friends, and other Diſſenters, in this Dioceſs of St. <hi>Aſaph.</hi> A little Time before I came out of the City, there came two or three grave Citizens (I ſuppoſe of the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> Congregation) and told me, They were come to let me know, that there was a Writ <hi>De Excommunicato Capiendo</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="unknown:006833_0101_102A5FF861816868"/>out againſt me, and there was one of their Friends in Priſon already on the ſame Writ in our County, and if I would contribute with them, they ſaid, they knew how to make it void. I told them, I knew there was a Writ out againſt me; and I did alſo know there was a Friend of theirs, one <hi>Richard Trollus</hi> in Priſon in <hi>Welch-Pool</hi> on that Writ. I told them, I thought they might make the Writ void, but I would contribute nothing towards St; for I told them I would haſten Home as ſoon as I could, and go to Priſon, if required: But they ſaid, They were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied I had other Reaſons why I would not make the Writ void, and deſired me to be free with them, and tell them my Reaſons. I told them, I thought they might make that Writ void with a great deal of Charges; but, ſaid I, how will you prevent the Biſhop from coming on again with another Writ, which you cannot make void? and if there be any Error in their Proceedings in this, no Doubt but the Biſhop and Chancellor will mend it in the next: And whether do you think it is better for me to go to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on this falſe Writ, or on a Writ that you can find no Error in? I ſaid, if I go to Priſon on this erroneous Writ, and
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:006833_0101_102A5FF861816868"/>the Sheriff or Jaylor gives me my Liberty the Biſhop or the Chancellor cannot juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſue them. And ſo thoſe Men went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way well ſatisfied with the Reaſons I gave them; and I know of no Money they ſpent to make the Writ void.</p>
            <p>I acquainted my Friend <hi>William Penn,</hi> and ſome other Friends, that I intended to give the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Lloyd</hi> a Viſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went to Priſon, if the Lord was pleaſed to make Way for me. So my Friend <hi>W. P.</hi> the Morning before I came out of the City, ſent me a Letter from the Lord <hi>Hide</hi> to the Biſhop, with his Coat of Arms on it, unſeal'd. So I took my Journey, and the Lord brought me ſafe Home, to the Comfort of my Family and Friends, who were afraid I had been detained from coming Home.</p>
            <p>Soon after my Return (even the next Morning) I ſet out to ſee the Biſhop, without Interruption; tho' the Sheriff, one <hi>Geoge M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rcer,</hi> was very envious to Friends, yet I eſcaped his Hands at this Time. I went to my Friend <hi>Tho. Wynne</hi>'s, who lived in a Town called <hi>Caerwys</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> not far from ſaid Biſhop's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and he went with me; and when we came there, the Bp's. Secretary came to the Gate, I asked him, Whether the
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:006833_0102_102A60261743C3C8"/>Biſhop was within? He ſaid he was; and asked me, who would ſpeak with him? I told him, That there was one <hi>Richard Davies</hi> would ſpeak with him: What, ſaid he, of <hi>Welch-pool?</hi> Yes, ſaid I: What ſaid the Secretary, my Lord Biſhop: Biſhop, as it ſignifies an Overſeer, ſaid I, I am; but Lord Biſhop, I deny. So the Biſhop ſent for us in; there were ſeveral Clergymen with him, and among the reſt the Dean of <hi>Bangor</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The Biſhop ſeemed to be diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I was not with them at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at <hi>Llanvilling:</hi> We went ſoon to diſpute about Water Baptiſm; I told them, <hi>There was one Lord, one Faith, and one Baptiſm;</hi> and that Baptiſm was neceſſary to Salvation; and that Water Baptiſm, which was <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, was to continue and remain but for a Seaſon. So this, and ſuch like Diſcourſe, held us till it was late that Night; and then I went to my Friend's Houſe, with an Order to be there again in the Morning. So I came in the Morning, and we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted upon the ſame Subject: I ſaid, If one ſhould grant what they deſired, <hi>viz.</hi> that Water Baptiſm was neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which I would not, where ſhould they have an Adminiſtrator, ſeeing that
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:006833_0102_102A60261743C3C8"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſays expreſly, <hi>He was not ſent to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel;</hi> and thanked God, that <hi>he Baptized none,</hi> except ſuch and ſuch, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 14, 17. And <hi>Peter,</hi> who Baptized many, came ſo to ſee the Invallidity of Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, that he ſaid, <hi>By Baptiſm we are ſaved, (not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh,</hi> (which outward Water could do no farther) <hi>but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1? So they went from this to their Ordination: I put them upon to prove, who ſent them to baptize; and ſo the Dean told me Such an One ordained him; and ſo he named from one to another. I told him, I thought I ſhould ſend him to <hi>Rome</hi> for their Succeſſion and Ordination. And they ſaid, Yes, the Ordination might be good, tho' it came from <hi>Rome.</hi> He bro't a Compariſon; as, Suppoſe a Malefactor was condemned to die, and a Reprieve was obtained, and it came down by the Hang-man's Hand; and tho' it came ſo, yet (ſaid he) the Pardon was good. Then ſaid I, Your Ordination comes not by the Spirit and Power of God. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn made them ſomewhat uneaſy; and the Time being pretty far ſpent, I was
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:006833_0103_102A5FFB98D78EE0"/>willing to be diſcharged, having been there in all Part of three Days.</p>
            <p>I told the Biſhop of good old <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxvi. 6. <hi>I will waſh my Hands in Innocency, then will I compaſs thy Alter, O God; that with the Voice of Thankſgiving I may publiſh and tell of all thy wond'rous Works.</hi> Then I ſaid to the Biſhop, Thou canſt not ſay, thou wilt waſh thy Hands in Innocency, nor compaſs the Alter of God, while thy Writs remain againſt ſo many innocent People, that are willing to ſuffer till Death for the Teſtimony of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences towards God: And I ſaid, Biſhop <hi>Lloyd,</hi> if I go to Priſon upon this Account, I ſhall have more Peace there, than thou ſhalt have in thy Palace. And I ſaid to him again, Suppoſe another Prince ſhould ariſe, that would impoſe ſomething upon thee, that thou could'ſt not do for Conſcience ſake, what would'ſt thou do? He ſaid Then I will go to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> alſo (for at that Time many Friends were about going there.) Then it came clearly to me, and I ſaid to the Biſhop, Though thy Head be gray, yet thou may'ſt live to ſee Liberty of Conſcience in <hi>England;</hi> though, as to outward
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:006833_0103_102A5FFB98D78EE0"/>Appearance it ſeemed to be very far from it at that Time.</p>
            <p>Then the Biſhop called for Pen and and Ink, and ſaid, he would write to the Chancellor for my Liberty; but I told him, I was not ſatisfied for myſelf to be at Liberty, and my Friends to be in Priſon: So he wrote to the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor to ſuſpend the Execution of the Writ; and when he had done, he read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me, and I owned his Kindneſs to us all therein. And then I took the Lord <hi>Hide</hi>'s Letter out of my Pocket, and gave it him; and when he ſaw the Superſcription, and knew from whom it was, he asked me, how I came by it? I told him, as I was coming out of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> intending for Priſon, a Friend of mine brought me that Letter the ſame Morning that I left the City. When he had read it, he ſaid, he hoped I was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that he had granted me the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of that Letter. I told him, I was ſo, and I hoped he ſhould have a Reward for his Well-doing.</p>
            <p>Then I was diſmiſſed, and had Leave to come Home, and brought a Letter to <hi>John Edwards,</hi> Chancellor, a peeviſh Man againſt Friends, who lived at a Place called <hi>Llanymynech,</hi> about eight
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:006833_0104_102A5FFE3B5671E8"/>Miles from <hi>Welch-Pool.</hi> When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Letter, he did according to the Biſhop's Order; and thoſe Friends in the Dioceſs, that were concerned therein, were not moleſted nor troubled on that Account any more; and the Friends that were in Priſon before were diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And we have great Cauſe to bleſs and praiſe the Lord, for all his Mercies Kindneſſes, and Deliverances to us; for hitherto he hath been our <hi>Eben-ezer,</hi> that is, <hi>the Lord hath helped us,</hi> 1 Sam. vii. 12.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of the Year 1682, my dear Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> and I went to viſit Friends in <hi>Herefordſhire, Worcesterſhire,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo came through their Meetings to <hi>London,</hi> before the Yearly Meeting. I acquainted my Friends <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>W. Penn,</hi> that I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to go to the Lord <hi>Hide</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Kindneſs for his kind Letter on my Behalf to Biſhop <hi>Lloyd. G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> ſaid, There was ſome Service to be done for ſuffering Friends in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and it was thought convenient, that Three of the City, and Three of the Country, ſhould go with the ſaid Sufferings, and, deſire the Kindneſs of the Lord <hi>Hide</hi> to preſent them to the King; the three Friends for the Country were, <hi>Charles</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="unknown:006833_0104_102A5FFE3B5671E8"/>
               <hi>Lloyd, Thomas Wynne,</hi> and myſelf for the City, <hi>G. Whitehead, Alexander Parker,</hi> and one more. Our Friend <hi>G. W.</hi> told me, that my Countryman Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkin,</hi> Secretary of State, was ſo croſs and ill-humouv'd, that when the King was inclin'd to Moderation and Tenderneſs to ſuffering Friends, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſtopp'd and hinder'd the Relief that was intended for them: And when we came to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> we waited a long-Time before we could ſpeak with them, they being upon a Committee a conſiderable Time; but we had ſent in by the Door-keeper, to acquaint the Lord <hi>Hide</hi> that we were there, and in Time they ſent for us in: The Secretary look'd grim upon us. But I went to the Lord HIDE, and did acknowledge his Kindneſs for his kind Letter on my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half to the Biſhop. He told me, as if I ſhould tell the Biſhop, there would be Liberty of Conſcience in <hi>England.</hi> I told him, I did ſay ſo; and I did believe it would be ſo in the God of Heaven's Time. Then the Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> ſpoke in a ſcornful Manner, and asked me, What was <hi>Welch</hi> for a <hi>Quaker?</hi> I anſwered him, <hi>Crynwr, Crynwyr;</hi> it being the ſingular and plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:006833_0105_102A6000F0B36840"/>But, ſaid the Secretary, we had no <hi>Welch</hi> for it, for there were no <hi>Quakers</hi> in the <hi>Romans</hi> Days. Then my Friend <hi>Charles Lloyd</hi> anſwered him, and ſaid, if thou did'ſt ask my Friend the Queſtion right, he hath anſwer'd thee right; for there is <hi>Engliſh, Welch, Latin, Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for a <hi>Quaker.</hi> The Secretary ſaid, Sir. I underſtand <hi>Welch</hi> pretty well, and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> but if you go to your <hi>Hebrew,</hi> I know not what to ſay to you. So in this Time I left my Friend <hi>C. L.</hi> to engage with this peeviſh Countryman, and in that Time Repreſented the Lord HIDE with a long Liſt of the Names of both Men, Women, and Children, in their ſeveral Priſons at <hi>Briſtol;</hi> I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to be ſo kind as to preſent their Sufferings to the King, which he ſaid he would; and our Friend <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> ſpoke further to him. Then I turned to the Secretary, and he directed his Words to me, and I ſpoke to him thus in <hi>Welch:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mae yn ddrwg gennif, fod un o Hilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeth yr hen Frittaniaid; yr rhai ydder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bynioddy Grefydd Griſtianogol yn gyntaf yn Loeger; yn erbyn yr rhai ſydd gwedi</hi>

            <p>
               <q>I am ſorry that one of the Stock of the antient <hi>Britains,</hi> who firſt received the Chriſtian Faith in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be againſt thoſe who have received the true Chriſtian Faith in this Day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He replied, He was not againſt our Friends; but he ſaid, our Friends gave their Votes for the Election of Parliament-Men that were againſt the King's Intereſt. I told him, it was our Birth-right, as we were Freeholders and Burgeſſes, to elect Men qualified to ſerve both King and Country; but how they were corrupted, when they came within theſe Walls, I knew not. Then the Secretary would have engaged farther with me in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about Religion: I told him, He was an antient Man, and that they had been a long Time there upon their Buſineſs, and if he would be pleaſed to diſmiſs us then, and appoint what Time we ſhould ſome Morning wait upon him, we would, if he pleaſed, ſpend an Hour or two with him in Diſcourſe about Religion: Upon which he took off his Hat, and thanked me kindly for my Civility; but we heard no more of the Diſpute. But upon the whole Matter, our Friend <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:006833_0106_102A600290838618"/>told me, he was more moderate to Friends afterwards, than he had been before. The Number of Priſoners that were in the ſaid Liſt delivered to the Lord HYDE to be preſented to the King, in both Priſons, amounted to 139, of which there were 18 aged Women, from ſixty and upwards, and 8 Children. In the latter End of the Liſt it was ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the Merciful, for they ſhall obtain Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had my ſeveral Exerciſes this Year 1682. in <hi>London,</hi> both from falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and otherwiſe: Once I was at the <hi>Bull and Mouth</hi> Meeting, and there were in the Gallery ſeveral troubleſome People, and none of our miniſt'ring Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that were in true Unity with us, but <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>W. Gibſon,</hi> the Gallery being pretty full; one of them ſeem'd to ſtrive to keep me out, and our Friends <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. G.</hi> perceiving it, made Way for me to come up to them; another of them had been ſpeaking long in the Meeting, and had made many weary of him: I was under a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in my Spirit for the Honour and Exaltation of the Name of the Lord and his Truth, and the Eaſe of many that were under Weights and Burthens; yet,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:006833_0106_102A600290838618"/>for Quietneſs ſake, I ſilently b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re the Weight and Exerciſe that was upon me, till he had done; and then my Mouth was opened in the Name and Power of God, and the Lord had Compaſſion on his afflicted Seed, and cauſed the Light and Life of his Countenance to overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow the Meeting, to the Comfort and great Satisfaction of the Faithful. At which Time I was made to detect the falſe Doctrine which one of them had declared to the People, <hi>viz.</hi> "That the Children of God are deſtroyed for want of Knowledge." I told the People, That the Children of God in theſe Days were the Children of the New Covenant; and the Covenant that he makes with them is. That <hi>they ſhall know him, from the Leaſt to the Greateſt,</hi> and the true Knowledge of God to his People in theſe Days is Life Eternal, <hi>John</hi> xvii 3. Though <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of old were deſtroyed for want of Knowledge, becauſe they did forget the God of their Fathers, that brought them out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and out of the Houſe of Bondage, inſomuch that the Lord complained of them, and ſaid, <hi>The Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſter's Crib, but my People know not me,</hi> Iſaiah i. 3. and elſewhere
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:006833_0107_102A6004B5E4AD38"/>it is ſaid, <hi>They have forgotten me Days without Number.</hi> Theſe were thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates that the Lord complained of, <hi>Jer.</hi> ii. 13. who had committed two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, they had <hi>Forſaken him the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Living Waters,</hi> and <hi>hewed them out Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns, that could hold no Water.</hi> Theſe were ſuch as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and their fooliſh Heart was darkened: For this Cauſe God gave them up unto vile Affections, and a reprobate Mind,</hi> Rom. i. 21. And the Apoſtates in our Days (ſaid I) have forgot the God that firſt made them acquainted in Meaſure with him: So they having loſt the Senſe of his Goodneſs, have ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves from the Love and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Brethren: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Children of God, who are faithful to the Meaſure of the Grace of God in themſelves, know it to be their Teacher and Leader into all Truth. And theſe are not deſtroyed for want of Knowledge, though the World know him not: there are Apoſtates in our Age who have loſt the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; but the Saints in Light, have and remain in the true Knowledge
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:006833_0107_102A6004B5E4AD38"/>of him, being guided by the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him: <hi>But ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you,</hi> John xvi. 17.</p>
            <p>When I had thus eaſed my Spirit, a Concern came upon our Friend and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and he ſweetly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Meeting in Prayer.</p>
            <p>After this I was pretty well cleared of the City, and was willing to draw home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and next Firſt-Day I came to <hi>Jordan</hi>'s Meeting in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> where we had a Bleſſed Meeting; then I went and had one Meeting at <hi>Cheſham,</hi> from thence I went to <hi>Robert Jones</hi>'s near <hi>Tring.</hi> And from thence I went to the Quarterly Meeting at <hi>Weſton-Turfield,</hi> not far from <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> where it opened in me, to adviſe and counſel Friends, to keep to thoſe Rules and Methods that were agreed on among us, in our Mens and Womens Meetings. As I was declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, came in an oppoſite Party; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I went on, and ſhewed them how it was agreed among the Apoſtles, to ſend choſen Men, endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with the Holy Ghoſt, to ſet up good Orders and Methods among them: So I delivered unto them, that it
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:006833_0108_102A6006EC9014C0"/>ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us alſo, to ſet up our Mens and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Meetings, that the Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the Church of Chriſt, might be upon holy, ſelf-denying Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who might take Care of the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Widows in their Afflictions, and keep themſelves unſpotted from the World; which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſays, is <hi>pure Religion, and undefiled before God,</hi> James i. 27. And that the Care of all, both poor Strangers, and Priſoners in Affliction, might be carefully and tenderly look'd after, and ſupplied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Neceſſities: And that the Miniſters of Chriſt in this Day, might take the Counſel of the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto yourſelves, and to all the Flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I had ended what I had to ſay from the Lord among Friends, one of the ſaid Party ſtood up and ſpoke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by Way of Reflection upon what I then delivered; and when he had done, our Friend <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> propoſed to the Meeting, that all ſhould ſit down, and wait to feel the Power of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb facs="unknown:006833_0108_102A6006EC9014C0"/>us, and let that decide, whether I did ſpeak in the Name and Power of God, among them this Day. To which the Meeting agreed, and all were ſilent, after which ſeveral Friends, as they were mov'd of the Lord, gave tenderly their Teſtimony, that what was delivered that Day, was in the Name and Power of God; and that his Preſence was with us; as honeſt <hi>Robert Jones,</hi> and <hi>Richard Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> who loved the Lord, and his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Truth, with all their Hearts, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others preſent in that Meeting. And there ſtood up a Young Man, that I knew not, whoſe Heart was affected and much broken in Spirit, and he ſaid on this wiſe, <hi>There is a Man come this Day amongſt us, I know not from whence he came, not where he goes; but this I am ſatisfied, the Lord ſent him here, and his Power and Preſence is with him, and his Teſtimony is for the God of Truth.</hi> I enquired after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, who that Young Man was? And they ſaid, he was one <hi>John Thornton.</hi> Upon this one of the Party broke in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and diſorderly againſt that, that had been agreed upon among us, before the Meeting had fully clear'd 'emſelves and ſmiſhed their Teſtimonies: But it proved greatly to his Diſhonor and Diſgrace, ſo
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:006833_0109_102A6008B62AC688"/>that he was made manifeſt to thoſe that did adhere to him. The Meeting held a long Time, from about Ten in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till (as they thought) Ten or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at Night. But bleſsed be the Lord, that doth not leave his People without a Witneſs to himſelf; and he is the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Defender of all his People that do wait upon him; and they that truſt in him, are as <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> that cannot be removed.</p>
            <p>After this, I made what Haſte I could Home, taking Meetings in my Way; as at <hi>Banbury,</hi> and the Country about, and Part of <hi>Worceſterſhire:</hi> So, bleſſed be the Lord, I came ſafe Home, to my Wife and Friends, where I found all Things well; bleſſed be his Name for ever.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1683 I went again to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to the Yearly Meeting, and ſtaid there ſome while after moſt of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Friends were gone out of the City. I was engaged one Firſt-Day for <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>-Meeting, and there was no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt'ring Friend there but myſelf, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral weighty Matters opened in me at that Meeting; as concerning the Church of Chriſt, what it was, and on what it was built: I ſaid, ſome be of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:006833_0109_102A6008B62AC688"/>that the Church of Chriſt is built upon <hi>Peter;</hi> and I opened to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the People ſomething of what is written in the 16th Chapter of <hi>Matthew:</hi> And I ſhewed them, that that which revealed unto <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt was the Son of God,</hi> was a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Spirit of God which was in <hi>Peter;</hi> for it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 27. <hi>No Man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any Man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Son will reveal him.</hi> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to <hi>Peter</hi> that Chriſt was the Son of God; and he is the only Rock that his Church is built upon, the Rock of Ages, the Foundation of many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the Gates of Hell never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd againſt: But the Gates of Hell prevail'd againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> when he deny'd his Lord and Maſter in the Time of his Sufferings; and therefore was not like to be the Rock which Chriſt built his Church on. It is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 4. <hi>For they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> And ſo Chriſt is the Rock, the ſure Foundation, that his Church is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 5, 6. <hi>&amp;c. Ye alſo as lively Stones, are built up
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:006833_0110_102A600D85877B48"/>a Spiritual Houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer Spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And in <hi>v.</hi> 8. he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Chriſt to be the Rock. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 15. "That the Houſe of God, the Church of the Living God, is the Pillar and Ground of Truth." This, ſaid I, may inform the blind and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant People of this Age, that Lime and Stone, and Temples that are made with Hands, are not, as they ſay, the Church of Chriſt, and the Houſe of God; 'For God dwelleth not in Temples made with Hands,' as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lxvi. 1. and the Martyr <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> vii. 48, 49. Thus I was concerned to declare the Truth in that Meeting, with much more to the ſame Effect. And after Meeting I went with ſome Friends towards the City; and as we were going along the Strand, the Queen was coming from her Chapel; and ſome of her: Life-Guard were very rude, and with the Staves that they had in their Hands they did knock and beat Friends that had their Hats on, all along as they came; and I received a Blow upon my Head that it ſwell'd, and was ſore a conſiderable Time. But bleſſed be the Lord, in all our Exerciſes, and Afflictions, his Life, and Power and
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:006833_0110_102A600D85877B48"/>Preſence bore us up in the Midſt of there all; Praiſes be to his pure and holy Name for ever.</p>
            <p>In this Time, before I came out of <hi>London,</hi> we met ſtill with more Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and Troubles: One Firſt-day in the Morning I was not well, and could not go to the Meeting, nor ſcarcely get out of my Bed; but when the Time of our Afternoon Meeting came, it lay upon me to go to the <hi>Bull and Mouth</hi> Meeting; and I told <hi>Job Bolton,</hi> with whom I lodged, that I muſt go to the ſaid Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He reaſon'd with-me; but I told him I would go ſo far as I could; and he ſaid he would go with me. And as we went through the Paſſage to go in, I heard a Voice, that I was ſatisfied was not the Voice of a true Shepherd; the Meeting being already gather'd, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People there: When I went up to the Gallery, there was one that was Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Perfection, who ſaid, <hi>Be ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as your heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> &amp;c. I ſtaid to hear him but a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, till I ſtood up and judg'd him, and told the People, <hi>That the Kingdom of God ſtood not in Words, but in Power, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs.</hi> Then this Man went in a Rage down out of the
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:006833_0111_102A6010C364B2B8"/>Meeting, land a conſiderable Company followed him; and a Friend or two went after them as far as <hi>Fleet Street,</hi> to ſee where they were going; and one of the Company ſaw the Friend, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him not to follow them too cloſe, leſt they ſhould do him a Diskindneſs: For we heard afterwards that there was a Wager laid that this Man (whom ſome ſaid was a <hi>Jeſuit</hi>) would Preach in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting, and that he ſhould not be diſcover'd; and had he gone without Reproof, they would ſay, that a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> preached in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting, and they could not diſcern him: But it was reported in many Places in the City, how that he was detected in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meeting, and he could not abide there. We have Cauſe to bleſs the Lord for his Goodneſs to his People, that gives them a diſcerning Spirit, to judge between Good and Evil, and between thoſe that ſerve God in Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all deceitful Hypocrites, who are to be judged and condemned by the Word of his Power.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of the Year 1685. King <hi>Charles</hi> died, and King <hi>James</hi> came to the Throne, and the Statute of 20 <hi>l per</hi> Month, for abſenting from the Publick
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:006833_0111_102A6010C364B2B8"/>Worſhip, (which I ſuppoſe was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Days) had been and was very much put in Force againſt our Friends, whereby many of them were almoſt ruined; the Sheriffs and their Bailiffs perſecuted them ſo ſeverely, and did make ſuch a Prey of them, that ſome that were worth many Hundreds, were made ſo deſtitute, that they had ſcarcely a Bed to lie upon, but were as it were robbed of all. And when King <hi>James</hi> came to be ſettled upon the Throne, our dear Friend <hi>G. Whitebead,</hi> who always was much concerned for the Sufferings of Friends up and down in the Nation, and who did not ſpare himſelf to viſit Kings and Parliaments, and all others, where he thought he could get Relief for his Suffering Brethren. He went to King <hi>James,</hi> and laid the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition of Suffering Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; after ſome Conſideration, the King told him, That what concerned him, or came to him of thoſe Fines, he very freely and readily would remit: Upon which an Order was granted, to ſuſpend the Rigour of their Proſecutions. But it ſeems, when it came out, another Party of People, that were at the <hi>Stern,</hi> called <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> took the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

Here I did ſee, they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took the Benefit of that Order to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had been under Sufferings alſo upon the ſaid Statute in thoſe Times.) <hi>George Whitehead</hi> hearing that I was in the City (at this Time) came to me, and told me the whole Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and underſtanding that I had Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt with the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> who was great with the King, he thought it might be of Service if I did go along with him to the Earl.</p>
            <p>So next Morning my Friend <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> and I went to the Earl of <hi>Powis</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Lincolns-Inn Fields;</hi> when he underſtood that I was come in, he very ſoon came to me; and when I had ended my Country-Buſineſs with him, I told him, I wanted a little of his Advice, in a Caſe wherein our Friends were great Sufferers, by a Law that was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that they were ſeverely whipp'd upon their Backs, by the Statute of 20 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> per</hi> Month, for not coming to hear that which is called <hi>Divine Service;</hi> and I told him, that a Friend of ours had waited upon the King, and had told him the whole State of Things, and that the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:006833_0112_102A6012C90C0658"/>King was very ready to relieve us in what he could, and that an Order was granted to that Purpoſe; but I told him, It ſeemed his Friends had taken the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it, and excluded us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So I deſired his Advice, whether we ſhould proceed farther in it, or no: He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all Means (for, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I will tell you, that there was taken from our Friends in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> 8000 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> upon this Statute, and the King and myſelf went to ſee how much of this Money came into the Exchequer; and when we ſaw it, it appeared that the King was in debt to that Account about 28 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> and all the reſt gone.) Then I deſired of him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was his Advice that we ſhould go on, and not be diſcouraged, that he would be pleaſed to grant that a Friend of mine might come in and ſpeak with him, who was more able to give him an Account of this Buſineſs than myſelf, and who had been with the King to get Relief in this Matter (for <hi>G. W.</hi> ſtaid all this while in an adjacent Room) ſo he bid me bring him up to him; and when <hi>George</hi> came, he opened the Matter ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him; and when he did thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand the Matter, he ſoon got himſelf ready, and called for his Coach,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:006833_0113_102A601493F64A60"/>and bid me come to him at an appointed Time; and he brought an abſolute Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the King, to ſtop all Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by Sheriffs and Bailiffs on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the Nation: And in a ſhort Time the Rage, Envy and Cruelty of ſuch devouring Men were ſtopp'd; and I know not that any have been troubled or ſuffered ſince upon that Statute: Bleſſed be God, that hears the Cries of of the Poor, and Fatherleſs, and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and ſends Relief to the Afflicted in his own due Time. And this I muſt ſay, that the Earl of <hi>Powis</hi> and his Counteſs were very ready and willing at all Times to do our Friends any Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that lay in their Way, and to help them out of their Troubles and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and I am apt to believe they did it conſcientiouſly, for there were many of our Friends in ſeveral of their Lordſhips hereaways, and the Earl never ſuſtered any of us to be fined for not appearing in any of his Courts upon Juries, or any other Way or Manner.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1688. it ſeemed good to King <hi>James</hi> to put out a Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and order'd the Biſhops to ſend it to their ſeveral Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that it might be read; there were
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:006833_0113_102A601493F64A60"/>Seven of them who would not read it. Bp. <hi>Lloyd</hi> aforeſaid was one of them, therefore they were committed to the Tower. Then I rememb'red that which I ſpoke to the Biſhop at his Palace in the Year 1681. when I queried of him, what if another Prince ſhould ariſe, that would impoſe ſomething upon him, that he could not do for Conſcience ſake! And that Year, when I went to <hi>London,</hi> I went to viſit him in his Troubles; and he ſaid to me, I often thought of your Words, and I could wiſh I were in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania</hi> now myſelf; he told me the Reaſon why they could not read the Declaration, ſaying, It was arbitrary, and not according to Law, and that it was a Matter of Conſcience to them; and withal, others were to have their Liberty by it beſides Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: He told me alſo, that they were put on to do as they had done to Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but when I told him of it before, he could not believe it, till it came thus upon them. I had acquainted him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, that I had read a Sermon that was preached to prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a falſe Church, becauſe ſhe was a perſecuting Church: And now, ſaid I, the Members of the Church of
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:006833_0114_102A601793B68DF8"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> puts you on, not only to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute upon the penal Laws that were made againſt Diſſenters, but by thoſe Laws alſo that were made againſt Popiſh Recuſants; and by the ſame Argument may we and they ſay, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a falſe Church, becauſe it is a perſecuring Church. The Biſhop ſaid, They did not conſider nor know it then, as they did now. And after I had ſtaid ſome Time with him, I took my Leave of him, and he did kindly acknowledge my Viſit; and after ſome Time they were releaſed.</p>
            <p>And afterwards the Biſhop came to <hi>Welch-Pool</hi> in the Aſſize Week, and in the Evening he ſent for me to him, to the High-Sheriff's Houſe; there being with him moſt of the Juſtices of the Peace, and Deputy Lieutenants of the County, with many of the Clergy, who were very civil to me. The Biſhop told them, That he ſent for me, and that he was more beholding to me, than all the Men in the Dioceſs, for I came to viſit him in his Troubles; and he deſired of them to do me all the Kindneſs they could, and he would take it as done to himſelf. And when Supper was over, the Biſhop and the High-Sheriff (<hi>Edward Vaughan</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="unknown:006833_0114_102A601793B68DF8"/>of <hi>Llangedwin</hi>) took me into a pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Room with them, and there we diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a little about the Times; and there was ſome Report of the coming in of the Prince <hi>Orange,</hi> and in a little Time I had an Account that the Prince was landed, which was great Satisfaction to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; for he ſaid, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience</hi> was Eſtabliſhed by Law, he and others were well ſatisfied with it.</p>
            <p>And now I think it is worthy to take Notice of the ſeveral Kindneſſes, upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Suffering Friends I received from this Bp. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> in his ſeveral Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes: Whereas we do Record the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs and Cruelty we found from unmerciful and perſecuting Biſhops and Clergy, and how many they have made Poor, Widows, and Fatherleſs, I think it is Juſtice and Equity in us to Record all Mercy, Tenderneſs and Compaſſion, we find from thoſe that are conſcientious and charitable among them: As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

               </gap> told them, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf drew that Clauſe in the Act; and he told them how they ought to go to a Juſtice for a Warrant: But, ſaid he, why will you go to the Charge of a Warrant? Cannot you go, and take a Pewter Diſh, or ſome other Thing near the Value? for I warrant they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſue you for it: For, ſaid he, we muſt do unto them, as we would be done unto, if we were in their Condition: So he quickly diſpatched them. Then I told him, I was come moreover in the Behalf of a Priſoner on the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, whoſe Name was <hi>Richard Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,</hi> near <hi>Ruabon,</hi> in <hi>Denbighſhire;</hi> and he adviſed me to go to the Chancellor (one Dr. <hi>Wynne</hi>) whom I ſhould find, he ſaid, a very fair Man; ſo he called
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:006833_0115_102A601B3B8AE798"/>him to us, and leſt us together: And then I took my Leave of the Biſhop, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his Kindneſs. And when I had fully diſcourſed the Chancellor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Priſoner, I found him very fair; and in a little Time after I heard my Friend <hi>R. D.</hi> was diſcharged; and ſeveral Kindneſſes I have had of the Chancellor ſince. And when the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Wardens came Home, they reported what Favour I had with the Biſhop, and were troubled thereat; but neither my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf nor Son-in-law, were ever after trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about thoſe Repairs of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip-houſe.</p>
            <p>At another Time, when I was going to <hi>London,</hi> and viſiting Friends in my Way, I call'd at <hi>Timothy Burberough</hi>'s, at <hi>Aino on the Hill,</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> where I underſtood he was gone to Priſon; I enquired the Cauſe of his Impriſonment, and his Wife told me, The Prieſt of the Pariſh had left their ſmall Tythes, and other Tythes, till he thought they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted unto a conſiderable Value, and then he came and drove and took away near all that they had, and ſent him to <hi>Northampton</hi> Goal, where he had been ſometime. I took a Memorandum of it, and when I went to <hi>London,</hi> I thought
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:006833_0116_102A601D07AFB278"/>of the Afflictions and Exerciſe of my poor Brother: And my old Friend Bp. <hi>Lloyd</hi> being then at <hi>London,</hi> I went to his Lodgings at <hi>Whitehall;</hi> and I muſt ſay, he was very ready to come to me; and after ſome Diſcourſe, I laid the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Caſe of my Friend <hi>T. B.</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid before him; he anſwered, He did not know what to do in it, the Prieſt of <hi>Aino</hi> was a Stranger to him, and out of his Dioceſs. I told him, If he would be pleaſed to write a few Lines to the Biſhop. of <hi>Peterborough</hi> (for it was in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſs) he might peradventure write a few Lines to the Prieſt of <hi>Aino,</hi> to be more moderate and conſcientious, in not taking more than the Value of that which he called his Due, and caſting the poor Man from his Family into Priſon alſo. The Caſe I left with the Biſhop, and he took care to ſend it to the Biſhop of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough,</hi> who ſent to the Prieſt of <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no;</hi> and Bp. <hi>Lloyd</hi> ſent the Prieſt's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, with a Letter from the Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough</hi> to himſelf, in a Letter of his to me near <hi>Welch-pool,</hi> which I took as a great Kindneſs and Favour from him.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, I went to <hi>London</hi> again, and I called at my Friend <hi>T. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berough</hi>'s, where I found him at Home,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:006833_0116_102A601D07AFB278"/>being releaſed; he told me the Prieſt had ſent an Order for him to come Home, and that he came to reaſon and diſcourſe with him. It ſeems he was not ſo unkind as he had been formerly.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1700, there was a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Suffering on Friends in <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire,</hi> an Account of which was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me by my Friend <hi>Edward Bourne,</hi> of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who deſired me to uſe my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with Biſhop <hi>Lloyd</hi> for the Relieſ of one <hi>John Fowler</hi> and his Mother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, the Widow <hi>Banbury</hi>) who was a Priſoner for Tythe in the out County<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and he ſent me their whole Caſe: When I underſtood it, I found a Concern upon me to make what Haſte I could to the Biſhop, who was then at his Palace at <hi>Hortlebury,</hi> a few Miles from <hi>Bewdley,</hi> I conſidered alſo what a Suffering our Friend <hi>William San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi> had been under, by one <hi>Vernon,</hi> a cruel, ungodly Prieſt of the Pariſh he lived in, who had caſt him into Priſon, when he had five or ſix ſmall Children, and his Wife lately dead: He ſeveral Times took from him more than treble the Value of his pretended Due for Tythe. From <hi>Bewdley</hi> I went to <hi>William San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi>'s, and I told him I was to go to the
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:006833_0117_102A6020AA79BFB0"/>Biſhop, and deſired him to go with me. So in the Morning we went together; I enquired for the Biſhop's Secretary, <hi>Francis Evans,</hi> who very lovingly came to us, and brought us in, and ſaid, He would go to acquaint his Lord that I was there and in a little Time the Biſhop came to us: And after ſome Diſcourſe, I told the Biſhop, I was not only come to give him a Viſit, but I was come purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Home, in Behalf of ſome Friends of mine, who ſuffered for Tythe in that Country; and that I was inform'd, that there had been three committed to Priſon in <hi>Worcester</hi> Goal by one <hi>Kerry,</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Tredington,</hi> and that two of them were releaſed, and the third remained a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner: Releaſed, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> how are they releaſed? I told him by the Hand of their great Creator. It ſeems then, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> they are dead. And the ſame Man, ſaid I, doth proſecute the Widow of one of them, (viz. <hi>William Banbury</hi>'s) and hath already put her into your Court, for that which her Husband ſuffered, and died for; and we reckon, that in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, when the Priſoner dies in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Proſecution ceaſes. I do not know, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> but the Debt may be paid, but the Charge is not; and I know not
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:006833_0117_102A6020AA79BFB0"/>what to do with that Man, for I hear he is a very covetous Man, and I have no Power over him, but once in three Years; I was lately in my Viſitation there, and had I known this then, I might have done your Friends ſome Kindneſs. Then I ſaid to him, If thou wilt be ſo kind as to write a few Lines to him, and let him know what Complaint is made to thee of him, and how thou art informed, that two of the three which he ſent to Priſon are dead; I do not queſtion but it might ſtop his Rage and ſevere Proſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the poor Widow, if not be a Means to Releaſe the other Priſoner. So he bid his Secretary take Notice of it, and put him in Mind to write to him. Then I told him of the Sufferings of <hi>William Sankev,</hi> who was there preſent, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired him to give Leave to my Friend to open the Caſe himſelf to him, which he did; and then he told how cruel the ſaid <hi>Vernon</hi> had been to him in caſting him into Goal, his Wife being dead, and left five or ſix ſmall Children: and he told him, that he had taken from him Goods worth about 12 <hi>

Sankey</hi> towards that Account; and he gave the Order to <hi>W. Sankey</hi> to deliver to the Prieſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>William</hi> to be there the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with the Prieſt: So when the Time came, as I was informed, the Prieſt went there the Day before to the Biſhop, and <hi>W. Sankey</hi> went the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: And I was inform'd that the Biſhop ſhould ſay, There was no Help for what was paſt, but he would take Care he ſhould do ſo no more to <hi>William Sankey;</hi> I heard that ſince that Time, he hath taken it in Kind from him, with more Moderation than before; and I heard that the Biſhop was kind to <hi>W. Sankey</hi> ever ſince.</p>
            <p>And as for the Priſoner at <hi>Worceſter, John Fowler,</hi> that was one of the Three before mentioned (<hi>Robert Grimes</hi> and <hi>W. Banbury</hi> being dead) he was diſcharged; and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>And at this Time, before I parted with the Biſhop, I told him, That there was a Friend of ours, one <hi>William Cattrill,</hi> that kept School in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who was proſecuted very cloſe by ſome, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing School without a Licenſe, and they did intend to bring him under an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicato Capiendo,</hi> and if he was not pleaſed to be kind to him, they would put him to all the Charge and Trouble they could. So the Biſhop bid his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary take Care about it. So all that I requeſted of the Biſhop at that Time, was friendly and kindly granted me, and Care was taken that they were not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled nor moleſted on them Accounts. Then the Biſhop order'd us to dine there that Day, and we parted friendly and lovingly with him; and he deſired me, when I came that Way, not to be ſtrange to him. From thence I went to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and gave Friends an Account of my Succeſs with the Biſhop: I ſtaid with them a little while, and from thence I went to <hi>Bromyand</hi> and had a Meeting there; ſo I went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In a little Time after, I went for <hi>London,</hi> and being at the Meeting about Friends Sufferings, there was mentioned the Sufferings of Friends in <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Caſtle by the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and they had been there for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Years, though Friends had made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to get them off, and Friends at <hi>Worceſter</hi> uſed their Intereſt with the Chancellor, who ſeemed to be very kind to them; yet, for all that, they could not have them diſcharged. So when I came down from <hi>London,</hi> I went to the Biſhop at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> he was very free with me, and in a little Time the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor came in to us, and the Biſhop gave me to underſtand who he was; I told them, I was glad to ſee them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for when I was lately in <hi>London,</hi> we had the Sufferings of our Friends in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> before us, for a ſmall Matter of Tythe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="217" facs="unknown:006833_0119_102A3847836E0D40"/>ſaid, that I thought the Chancellor was not a Stranger to it; for I had heard he had been often ſolicited on their Behalf. The Chancellor told him, he did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and that theſe Men were there for an inconſiderable Matter; and he ſaid, he was ſorry that thoſe Men died in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> becauſe in Conſcience they could not pay that little Tythe to the Prieſt of <hi>Tredington,</hi> and he was afraid theſe Men would die there alſo, except ſome Way was found out for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe: And the Biſhop asked, how long they had been there? and I think the Chancellor ſaid, Four or five Years. So the Biſhop ſaid, Diſcharge them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them; and ordered them to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged without paying any Fees. So after a little Time I parted with the Biſhop and Chancellor, and acknowledged their Kindneſs: And I went to Friends in the City of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and told <hi>William Pardoe</hi> what Succeſs I had with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and deſired him to wait on the Chancellor to get the Order, that it might be ſent ſpeedlly: And in a little Time I heard they were diſcharged.</p>

               <hi>Hitherto, Reader, thou haſt had a ſhort Relation of ſome of the Labours and Services of our ancient and honourable Friend,</hi> Richard Davies, <hi>from his own Account, which he finiſhed a little before his Deceaſe: It remains, therefore, to give ſome Account of his laſt Years Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>together with the Time and Manner of his Departure,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the Year 1702. he went up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> his Daughtet <hi>Tace Endon</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying him; and he ſtaid in and about the City for ſeveral Weeks, viſiting Friends in their Meetings, and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good and comfortable Opportunities among them. He, together with Eleven Friends more, were appointed by the Yearly Meeting to go to the Queen at <hi>Windſor,</hi> with an Acknowledgement from Friends for the Continuation of their Liberty and Protection under her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; at which Time he in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpoke to the Queen. And when he was clear of thoſe Parts, he returned homewards, and came through <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="unknown:006833_0120_102A60280E768F78"/>where he went to viſit his old Friend Bp. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> who was glad to ſee him, and that was the laſt Time they ſaw each other.</p>
            <p>After his Return Home, he often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited ſome Neighbouring Meetings; and was at the Yearly Meeting of <hi>Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Spring following.</p>
            <p>About the latter End of the Third Month, 1704. he went up to <hi>London</hi> again to the Yearly Meeting, his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>David Endon</hi> attending him; he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Friends as he paſſed through <hi>Stow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erbridge, Banbury, Aylesbury,</hi> &amp;c. and ſtaid in and about the City for near two Months, being ſomething weak and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and when he was clear of the City, he returned pretty directly Home, and came well to his Family.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of the Year 1705. he met with ſome Exerciſe; for on the 1ſt of the Third Month, his dear and honeſt Wife died, who had been very tender and careful over him, and a Woman ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerviceable to Friends and Truth in many Reſpects: She was a plain, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and honeſt-hearted Woman, and was one that loved Truth in Simplicity, and ſhe left a good Report behind her,

            <p>In the Firſt Month, 1706. he was at the Yearly Meeting of <hi>Wales</hi> at <hi>Llanid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> in <hi>Montgomeryſhire,</hi> being the laſt Yearly Meeting he was at in <hi>Wales</hi> On the 15th of the Second Month follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he took his Journey, with his Grand-ſon <hi>D. E.</hi> towards <hi>Briſtol;</hi> he had a Meeting at <hi>Lemſter</hi> and at <hi>Roſs</hi> in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and thence went to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> and lodged at <hi>Charles Harford</hi>'s, jun. where he viſited Friends at their Yearly Meeting, and ſtaid there about a Week; and then, on the 30th of the Second Month, ſet forward towards <hi>London,</hi> and came to <hi>French-bay,</hi> and had a Meeting there; and the Firſt of the Third Month he had a Meeting at <hi>Sadbury</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire;</hi> the Fifth at <hi>Carenceſter;</hi> the Eighth at <hi>Oxford,</hi> being the Firſt Day of the Week, where many of the Scholars came in, and were rude for ſome Time; but after our Friend <hi>Richard</hi>

               </gap> had ſpoke a while in the Meeting, they became more ſober, and ſome of them ſat down, and ſtaid till the Concluſion of the Meeting; and Friends took Notice that the Meeting was much more quiet than uſual. From thence
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:006833_0121_102A602CCF82D728"/>he went to <hi>Henly,</hi> and had a Meeting there; and ſo to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where he had a Meeting; thence he went to <hi>London,</hi> and lodged at his Friend and Kinſman's <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi>'s: He attended the Yearly Meeting, and ſtaid in and about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, viſiting Friends at their Meetings, until the 19th of the Fourth Month; at which Time he returned Homewards, and had a Meeting the 21ſt at <hi>Cheſham,</hi> where <hi>William Bingley</hi> was; the 22d they had a Meeting at <hi>Aylesbury;</hi> and went thence to their Yearly Meeting at <hi>Banbury,</hi> where were many Friends from divers Parts. The 28th he came to <hi>Worceſter, William Bingley</hi> ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying him, where they had a Meeting. The 30th he went to <hi>Droit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and had a Meeting there. The 1ſt of the Fifth Month he had a Meeting at <hi>Bromſgrove;</hi> the 2d at <hi>Birmingham,</hi> and lodged at <hi>John Pemberton</hi>'s; the 4th he went to the Quarterly Meeting at <hi>Woolverhampton,</hi> and paſſed thence to <hi>Stowerbridge,</hi> and lodged at <hi>Ambroſe Crowleys:</hi> And ſo on the 9th of the 5th Month, 1706, he returned ſafe Home to his Family at <hi>Cloddiecochion,</hi> near <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> having been away near three Months.</p>

               <pb n="222" facs="unknown:006833_0122_102A602F6E029C38"/>
After this Journey he continued moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Home and in his uſual Health, and viſited ſeveral Neighbouring Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. In the latter End of the 8th Month, he was at the Burial of an ancient Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Friend (<hi>Anne Thomas</hi>) in <hi>Salop,</hi> and at ſeveral other Burials near Home; at which Times he often had very good Service, and People would hear him gladly, for he had a ſolid and grave Delivery, and was wiſe and ſound in his Matter, which, was much taking with moſt People.</p>
            <p>His laſt Sickneſs was very ſhort: For on Sixth Day of the Week he was at <hi>Welch-Pool,</hi> and finding himſelf not well, went Home, and the next Day kept the Houſe, on Firſt-Day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeveral Friends went to ſee, him from <hi>Dolohran</hi>-Meeting, and had a little Opportunity to wait together upon the Lord with him.

            <p>The 25th being the Day appointed for his Burial, many Friends from divers
